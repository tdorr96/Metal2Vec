    "Band Reviews": [
        "\nVenom is probably the single most divisive band in metal, as half of the community seems to praise them as the founders of extreme metal, and the other half claims that the band is nothing more than a poor man's Mot\u00f6rhead who just happened to influence \"true\" black metal bands by having lyrics about satan. I strongly side with the former. This is because, if the music is analysed in the context of 1981, when the second heaviest band in the world was The Exploited or maybe Accept, it is undeniable that Venom was the very start of the more extreme metal, and I believe that they are the sole reason for the evolution of metal in the first place.\n\nNo band prior to this album had even tried pushing the boundaries past sounding like Iron Maiden or Judas Priest, and intentionally trying to make the music inaccessible was deemed exclusively counterproductive at the time. So why am I ranting about this on a review about Welcome To Hell? Because, this was the more important of two albums, including its successor, that led to the start of anything heavier than thrash metal in the first place.\n\nNow, onto the music. It is very typical of 1981; there are many bluesy riffs and catchy use of chords in a very traditional NWOBHM style with a sound admittedly very similar to Mot\u00f6rhead, but Venom had something different in their music, something ground-breaking and entirely noticeable as soon as you press play; the production is awful, the playing is sloppy, the vocals are wretched and obnoxious, and the lyrics are juvenile, and it's amazing. I can't imagine how unique this would have sounded at the time, the fuzzy production makes the album crushingly heavy, and insanely powerful-sounding. \n\nThis is the reason why so many of the songs on this record are anthemic, from the title track to One Thousand Days In Sodom, Welcome To Hell churns out unforgettable hooks and stupidly badass riffs. The bass is way up front in the mix, which makes the music sound static-heavy and actually improves a lot of the more groove-oriented songs, namely Schizo, one of my personal favourites. The mixture of all of these aspects, from the reverb-heavy production to the snarling vocals from Cronos, and the legendary basslines, is what makes most of the tracklist on Welcome To Hell undeniable classics.\n\nHowever, Venom also prove on this record that they can be dynamic when they want to, exemplified by the beautiful interlude, Mayhem With Mercy, which is mostly an acoustic guitar piece that is a nice bridge between Schizo and Poison. But after that, it's a straight run of classic songs that may be short, simplistic and formulaic, but it would be remiss to say that they aren't excellent. The drumming is average, but bear in mind that Venom isn't going for technicality with this album, if you didn't already notice. Specifically, the focus of the music is almost wholly on the aesthetic, which is what makes this record universally acclaimed and so special. This aesthetic had never been fully tried before.\n\nAs I stated earlier, Accept and Iron Maiden may have toyed around with songs about killing people, and Black Sabbath famously covered topics of black magic and war more than a decade before, but never before had a band completely delved into nothing but sex, blasphemy and debauchery, and Welcome To Hell shows that Venom perfected this on the first attempt. That alone justifies their praise over the years, and the music itself is catchy and to-the-point. In conclusion, it's understandable why people may not enjoy Venom's music, but this is the definitive start of bands pushing the boundaries, and therefore Welcome To Hell could arguably be the one album that caused most of the metal we listen to now to exist in the first place. The importance of this album both musically and aesthetically is something that must be respected.\n",
        "\nBlack Metal is quite a drastic change from its predecessor; not in terms of tone or themes, but musically the songs are much more punchy and heavy. Sure, the songs are still short, and the delivery is still obnoxious, but this time around, Venom is focusing more on straightforward riffing, with less blues influences and a more forward-thinking songwriting style. For example, without trying to sound like a hipster, considering this record predates any official Metallica, Exodus, Slayer or Overkill release, some of the riffs are pretty mind-blowing in that they are pretty much thrash metal before thrash metal existed. But, Black Metal is its own album in its own right, and since I talked enough about influence in the Welcome To Hell review, I'd rather get straight into the music.\n\nAs I said, Black Metal is absurdly heavy, and the band sounds surprisingly tight. They definitely utilise more dynamic sections, such as the \"lay down your souls\" part of the title track, and the slower, more thundering song that is Buried Alive, which was a live stfaple for Venom just because it stood out for its slow tempo and more groovy approach. Teacher's Pet, the reincarnation of Poison from the first album, shows that the band still has a lot of bluesy, dirty aspects that still sound much closer to rock n roll like Mot\u00f6rhead than black or thrash metal, but after that the band reverts back to ripping 3-minute anthems like Leave Me In Hell and Don't Burn The Witch. \n\nThere has been a noticeable increase in tempo on Black Metal, and the band is clearly evolving and becoming more extreme musically to fit the aesthetic more. The production on this record is also a huge improvement; the guitars sound massive and dark, and the drums also sound huge, giving the album a very spaced out atmosphere. The lead guitars are still amazing, and liken heavily to other NWOBHM bands that actually works very well with the demented riffs. Cronos' growls are more confident and vociferous. \n\nIn terms of subject matter, Black Metal is identical to its predecessor, but this was the definitive sound that Venom pushed, and I don't necessarily think that this is a bad thing, although had this album came out last year I probably would have thought it was a joke because of how generic the lyrics are, but remember that this was before extreme metal and controversial lyrics even really existed, maybe except for Mercyful Fate and some hardcore punk bands. Of course, regardless of lyrics, the music still kicks ass, and Venom still have plenty of memorable tracks on their second effort, showing that the band is not abandoning quality to embrace a theme. As a whole, Black Metal is essential for any fan of metal, and while it can't hold a candle to Venom's godlike debut, it is still an incredible record.\n",
        "\nVenom is probably heavy metal's first one-hit wonder.\n\nWell, more like three-hit wonders but still. They had 3 largely successful albums with \"Welcome to Hell\", \"Black Metal\", and \"At War With Satan\", but then faded in relative obscurity; releasing nothing noteworthy afterward (until maybe Storm the Gates or so).\n\nBut hey, they coined the term \"black metal\", a genre known for murderous lunatics, edgy satan-worshipping teenagers, and spooky forest album covers. How does the genre's \"\"first\"\" ever release hold up?\n\nWell for one, it's not really black metal at all. More of speed metal mixed with faster NWOBHM.\n\nSee, Venom really were the first major band to use satanic imagery for their albums, and be serious about it. AC/DC may have had songs like \"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\" a few years earlier, but Venom took it to the first ever extreme.\n\n\"Black Metal\" begins with a chainsaw, with grinding noise it leads into guitarist Mantas' opening riff. Vocalist Cronos has a gravel-like voice here but doesn't compare to the screeches on later, actual black metal releases. Black Metal's lyrics are rather cartoonish, and feel childish compared to something like, say, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Though, you must remember how when this came out, lyrics like these were thought to turn kids into devil-worshippers. For that, I can excuse them for the time period (though, the title track's lyrics are still quite laughable).\n\nThey did the drums quite well on the production department. They aren't \"booming\" exactly but they groove to Cronos and Mantas' rhythms. They add to the atmosphere of some songs, mainly the slow beginning of \"Buried Alive\" and it's speedy follow-up \"Raise the Dead\".\n\nVenom really suffered from only having 1 guitarist from this time. Solo's sound weak and underpowered and don't match the power an album like this should have. Venom is like a more raw and aggressive version of Motorhead, and Motorhead worked with one guitarist because of good production and Lemmy being an accomplished musician. As much as some headbangers would hate to hear, Venom weren't really that great musicians. They were fucking amazing performers but not musicians. \n\nCronos believe it or not sings well on this record. Not well as in he's good, but well as in it fits the music. He sort of matches Lemmy in the vocal department, as both of them aren't great at singing, but know how to fit it with the music being played. This shows in songs like Countess Bathory, Sacrifice, and To Hell and Back.\n\nThe song \"Teachers Pet\" is a highlight due to how unfitting it is. It's not necessarily a bad song but doesn't fit with the rest of the songs on the record. It's like a bonus track they stuck at the end of side A. However, it's interesting due to basically being a sort of blues rock song (mainly with the interlude). Not really what you'd expect from a \"black metal\" album now, would ye?\n\nThe album ends with the intro to their follow-up album, At War With Satan. A neat teaser, I suppose, but I feel it shouldn't have been stitched together with Don't Burn the Witch. It kinda messes up my listen whenever I listen to the album, and should've been left as a... Bonus track, of sort.\n\nAll in all, Venom's \"Black Metal\" may have coined the term for the revolutionary metal sub-genre, but the album definitely shows it's age, and should not be anyone's first listen to \"\"black metal\"\", and expect the rest of the genre to be like this. \n\n-Someone who's rather grateful, and somewhat dead inside.\n",
        "\nIt would be hard to say that what Black Sabbath recorded in the 70's was not heavy metal, given the circumstances and, of course, the heavy and dark sound, unheard of at the time. In the same way, it is difficult to discredit the black metal label to Venom, given the musical lineage that was constituted through the sound of the English band, a blueprint to so many extreme acts. Of course, listening to an album like \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d without having any explicit reference to the impact and influence this record had on the extreme metal scene, one could say it's a dirtier and more sinful version of Mot\u00f6rhead, allied to high doses of a kind of thrash metal in its embryonic stage.\n\nAll of this is true at the same time, however. Venom's sound is not far or radically different from what was practiced in British heavy metal at the time. There's a lot of Mot\u00f6rhead going on here, but also a lot of other things coming out of the so-called New Wave of British Heavy Metal. However, I believe that art and therefore music are much more than black and white. In fact, there is an unhealthy amount of anachronism in the categorization of Venom as a proto-thrash band and not a black metal one, based on two musical movements that only settled into their final form years after the recording of the first two seminal works by the English trio.\n\nAll that said, there is as much evidence as possible that this one, albeit not as much as its successor, is a black metal record like any other. There's not all that standard second wave musical format, but the dirtiness, the sense of freedom or \"I do what I want and fuck it\", the clumsy and muddy production, the musicality filled with an aggressiveness made of no big frills, the theme of the lyrics, the use of sinister aliases for the band members and, of course, the live performance, all these things are right here for anyone who wants to see. I myself was one among many purists who failed to intertwine Venom with \u201ccontemporary\u201d black metal, even though I already recognized its immense importance. However, as my musical mentality matured and I saw the internal aspects of the art that are not so superficial, I realized that I was being anachronistic and excessively methodical.\n\nAnd does the music quality justify the legendary status of this album? I would say yes, even though I'm not the biggest fan of lo-fi productions or even the more \u201cedgy satanist\u201d scene of major black metal. However, as with so many bands I listen to and are exceptions to these personal tastes, the rawness and shock value that exist in \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d work surprisingly well. There is a vitality that transcends the record's almost lack of musical technique. It's such an immensely fun album to listen to, with catchy riffs and simple but effective leads. The drums have a rudimentary but extremely fitting technique in the sonic aura of the album as a whole. And what about Cronos's thundering and extremely distorted bass? Well, the same thing we can say about his vocal performance: barely technical, but with loads of attitude and presence.\n\nEach of the album's eleven tracks follows more or less the same formula: a hybrid between vintage garage rock 'n' roll and seminal, extremely rough British heavy metal style, all done with spectacular energy. This set Venom apart from other bands in the scene. It's as if they've taken the entire surrounding atmosphere and thickened every particle of it, resulting in a sinister wave of pure metal, in its most hedonistic and uncompromising form. It's the kind of sound that, by being so bad, it's actually great. Something so vibrant and filled with a contagious spirit of youthful rebellion that it can't go unnoticed. Of course, today you can listen to the most modern metal bands and prefer their neatest and most frivolous way of making heavy music, their exotic time signatures, their dissonant way of playing, the philosophical depth of their lyrics. I myself like some great bands that fit that formula. However, it's nearly impossible to be a die-hard metal fan and not be completely swept away by \"Welcome to Hell\" and its infectious journey to the gates of Hades, the kind of thing we need in order to remind ourselves why most of us came to love that kind of music to begin with.\n",
        "\nPinpointing the earliest example of a new genre or subgenre is a fool's errand. But we can certainly identify major inroads - and of these, Venom's debut demo is one of the best demonstrations of what would become black metal. The punky approach to metal that typified Welcome to Hell and Black Metal comes out in full force in these three tracks, with \"Angel Dust\" ripping at the very beginning in a snarlable chorus and thumping percussion. Despite being a debut demo from 1980, it has just the right amount of shine and roughness to capture the songs without losing any bite - from the paunchy bass to the smacking snare hits to the slightly de-emphasized guitars.\n\nNotably, this is one of the two Venom releases to feature Clive Archer rather than the imminently-recognizable Cronos - and, this is the only release to exclusively feature Archer on vocals. He performs excellently here - though Cronos would be the veritable face of the band (who else could sing \"Teacher's Pet\"?), Archer has a voice that evokes a half-century of living on ten packs of cigarettes and a fifth each day. All that despite he, with the rest of the band, were still literal teenagers. Yet Demon has all that fuck-all attitude characterizing both the best of NWOBHM and black metal's beginnings. His lip-curling delivery gives Demon a hard rock edge; though Demon is absolutely not black metal in the way we know it, it demonstrates the seeds of what the band and the subgenre would eventually become.\n\nDemon sits at a nice junction where it is both historically important and great to listen to today. \"Raise the Dead\" is one of the best tracks of its time, with the echoing fade on \"We raise the dead!\" awesomely fitting the Halloween-horror vibe and slight sleaze lurking within. Give these 12 minutes a shot - it won't disappoint fans of early black metal or NWOBHM.\n",
        "\nYep, lay lady lay\u2026 and not only lady\u2026 cause the infamous legendary trio from Newcastle were back in the year 1997 AD. Well, \u201cback\u201d would be a bit far-fetched, honestly, as Mantas and Abaddon jammed together all the way to 1992, and it was only Cronos who didn\u2019t lay those last lands to waste. Fair play, the man had his own proclivities to indulge in, parading as a fire dancer for a bit before contracting this near-fatal rock\u2019n roll disease\u2026 but all good, all good, everyone is allowed at least one twist in his/her sobriety, and when you humbly accept the proposition to shred with your old colleagues once again, I guess all sins should be forgiven, and you can start over with another tabula rasa.\n\nAs I never became the band\u2019s most ardent fan out there, whether the guys had decided to recruit Tony \u201cDemolition Man\u201d Dolan or Arnold \u201cThe Terminator\u201d Schwarzenegger as a Cronos replacement wouldn\u2019t have made any difference to me. I would personally have betted on the latter, but only after he\u2019d promised to never utter this terrifying \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d upon his inevitable departure from the Venom camp\u2026 anyway, the reason why I bought this cassette on a cold November afternoon was by no means the ridiculous cover\u2026 it was the quality of the first three tracks that I listened to in the shop. Yep, the snake charmers charmed yours truly with this new slab which must have disappointed quite a few fans out there\u2026 those who refused to accept the fact that the unholy English musketeers had long since subjected themselves to familiarity. Cause this wasn\u2019t grey metal, or crimson metal, or any other new metal\u2026 the invention/patent department within the metal scene had shut down the moment the aggro and the groove started marching in the early-90\u2019s, and the new at the time Venom stint by no means sounded earth-shaking enough to compel it to re-open. \n\nSo how does this familiarity sound according to the Venom gospel? Oops, since we\u2019ll be working with this term, right off-the-bat, the extremely familiar material, the one featured on CD 2, won\u2019t be mentioned even remotely here as these are re-mastered versions of old songs. We\u2019ll be dealing with the lesser, brand-new familiarity which, quite honestly, isn\u2019t that far from the one served on the two albums with Dolan, only devoid of the more urgent thrashy invasions. Well, for an album containing whole 14 tracks, said invasion must be present, at least ethereally, but this is a more composed, less spastic recording, stitched by a band who have nothing to prove; neither do they have anything too striking to achieve, mind you, just consolidating a reputation that has kept them sailing even on auto-pilot all the way to\u2026\n\nhell and back; yes, black metal does exist but largely in the song-titles (\u201cAll Devils Eve\u201d, \u201cThe Evil One\u201d, \u201cRaised in Hell\u201d), those placed at the beginning, understandably, also disguising the rowdier, more aggressive material before the album hits the more laid-back classic power/thrash parameters and stays there, sometimes smelling doom (\u201cDestroyed & Damned\u201d, \u201cDomus Mundi\u201d), sometimes serving something more playful (\u201cGod's Forsaken\u201d) and hard rock-ish. Certainly, rude awakenings (\u201cFlight of the Hydra\u201d) are provided, disturbing the peace with spasms of less controlled thrashier behavior, but they\u2019re far from the epicentre the latter smeared a bit by the sincere sing-along clumsiness of \u201cKings of Evil\u201d and the anti-climactic slowmotion apocalypse offered on the repetitive \u201cJudgement Day\u201d\u2026 yep, Hell ain\u2019t such a bad place, even if it stretches all the way from here to eternity. \n\nSo, how do we feel about the hellish trio\u2019s stone tribute? Yes, our heroes play it safely; yes, this isn\u2019t black metal; yes, this isn\u2019t a masterpiece by any means, neither modern nor classic\u2026 and yet it\u2019s enjoyable to hear the once-fearsome Newcastlers moshing with macabre moderation, deliberately discarding all modern shite, sounding confident if not exactly first-class. It takes a bit more than the requisite slap of temerity to produce a classic-sounding effort in those times, but we\u2019re talking Mantas, Abaddon and Cronos here, hey\u2026 for them the times when they were giving interviews with renowned magazines dressed in full-metal armour, with axes and snakes prominently sticking out of their attire, never went away\u2026 groove, aggro, grunge, crap\u2026 what are those? \u201cSpeak the language of Satan, lady! Or you won\u2019t get laid even if Bob Dylan himself descends from Heaven! And do not think even for a split second that your big blue eyes and even bigger boobs will save you from us kicking you out of the studio the moment you ask the near-lethal question of why we haven\u2019t laid our souls to the gods of groove yet\u2026 oh, mentioning the boobs, are those natural? No, don\u2019t answer that; we\u2019ll find out immediately\u2026 just let this cobra here suck on that one\u2026 right now!\u201d \n\nNope, surrenders to insalubrious influences have never been scheduled in this camp, like the follow-up \u201cResurrection\u201d showed so well, although that opus was recorded without Abaddon\u2019s participation the man fired more or less ceremoniously, and swiftly replaced by Cronos\u2019 brother Antton. The course was paved, what was left was the remaining musketeers to find ways to work together without any turmoil\u2026 which never happened. For \u201cMetal Black\u201d Mantas was gone, too, leaving Cronos the sole captain of the ship which has been sailing relatively smoothly through the new millennium, the waves made by the Mantas/Abaddon rival formation Venom Inc. not big enough at this stage to perturb the voyage that, naturally, goes all the way to hell\u2026 and back.\n\nThere\u2019s also another thing that keeps me awake at night, mind you\u2026 the titles of the first two albums after the reformation\u2026 I don\u2019t think the guys have thought this through\u2026 I\u2019d personally put the resurrection before the cast in stone\u2026 why? Well, think about it: if you cast yourself in a stone monument, especially if it\u2019s a marble or granite one, resurrecting out of it would be really hard, if not plain impossible. If you achieve the resurrection, and bring yourself back on the earth plane, then immortalizing yourself in a stone effigy afterwards should be a piece of cake. Resurrection is a tougher process, it should come first; and then the carving\u2026 sorry, casting in stone\u2026 the closer to Stonehenge the more supernatural.\n",
        "\nAll too often, when a band releases a single, it is pretty worthless, typically being a couple of songs off the upcoming album or some such nonsense, making the single pointless once the proper album has been released. Sometimes bands will spice things up a bit by having an unreleased song on the b-side or a live track. Venom did things differently. As usual.\n\nWhen Venom released singles, they were usually comprised of new songs. However, Venom also did something else odd with many of its singles: there is a 7\" and a 12\" version, with the 12\" featuring an additional song. This is exactly what happened with Warhead.\n\nThe title song is a memorable song to kick things off with. It starts with some pounding drums with some growls from Cronos and one of those classic Cronos/Mantas/Abaddon-era Venom riffs, which is likely to get stuck in your head. Then there is a brief halt before the drums pound again and the chorus kicks in. Then the song is off and running. \n\nNext up is \"Lady Lust\", which, lyrically at least, is on the level of something like \"Poison\" from Welcome to Hell or \"Teacher's Pet\" from Black Metal, although not as silly as \"Teacher's Pet\", classic though that song is (not to mention a particular teacher from my high school years it makes me think of). \"Lady Lust\" is probably the most straight-forward, no nonsense kind of song on here. However, it is no less catchy for that.\n\nThe finale is also one of my all-time favorite Venom songs and remained a very rare one for so many years: \"Seven Gates of Hell\". Part of the reason for the song's rarity is that it's an extra song featured only on the 12\" version of the Warheadsingle. Then, when the early CD releases of Venom's albums got released through Combat, some of the songs from singles were added into the albums, but not all. \"Seven Gates of Hell\" was one of the ones that got left out. Thankfully, it is now a much easier song to get these days, having been since included on various compilations, as well as later reissues of the classic Venom albums. This song was the #1 reason I snagged this record up when I found it many years ago. \n\nThe opening is moody and atmospheric before the band comes crashing in with the main riff. Try not singing along to this beast of a classic song. It isn't a super-fast song, but more of a mid-paced one, although a faster mid-paced song. Also, it is fairly dynamic, with a cleaner mid-section where the band takes it down a notch to increase that mood before going into the solo. Then the song seemingly comes to the close with full Venom dramatics, but then the band starts playing again as the track fades out. It feels something like when you hear a live track by a band, but at the end of the song the band goes right into the next song and the recording fades out on it. It leaves you wanting more, which is a good thing. If you got to the end and thought \"it's about damn time this frigging thing ended,\" the song wouldn't be all that great.\n\nSimply put, this is a solid single from start to finish and features only songs that were not otherwise available, at least back in those days and even for many years after. If you see this one, it is certainly a record to pick up.\n",
        "\nVenom need no introduction for any metalhead. Or at least for those who are into thrash, black, speed and heavy metal. Yeah, for any metalhead. It\u2019s a legendary band that have been around since 1979 with some breaks and many lineup changes. But what most of the metal fans think of and what want to remember when it comes to Venom are their releases from 1979 to 1985 and the lineup that consisted of Cronos, Mantas and Abaddon. But only the true fans know that in the beginning the band also had a vocalist Clive Archer, that was naming himself\u2026 Jesus Christ! They recorded a few demos with him that used to be very rare, some of them were also unreleased! To this day. Last year the band released an anthology for their 40th anniversary called In Nomine Satanas. One of the elements of the box set was Sons of Satan: Rare and Unreleased vinyl compilation that consists of those demos. This August, the compilation will be released separately, as 2 12\" vinyls and CD digipak. I\u2019m going to tell you why I think that it\u2019s worth checking out.\n\nFor most of the bands I\u2019m not very much interested in compilations, nor in demos. Compilations are releases that contain songs from many different albums, while I always prefer listening to the full studio albums as they often are coherent pieces of art. Demos in turn are more of a \u201cfun facts\u201d of the band history than the releases I would normally listen to. Although when I received Sons of Satan I thought that I need to listen to it, because those demo recordings are the very beginnings of the genres I love with my whole blackened heart. What I expected from them was being raw recordings of the first versions of the songs that I already know very well. And it is true for the first, 1979 recordings. But I didn\u2019t expect that one of the studio sessions from 1980 will be\u2026 better than Welcome to Hell itself to me!\n\nThe compilation starts with Church Hall Rehearsals recordings from 1979. As you can expect, they\u2019re raw as hell and very chaotic. You can barely hear anything but the noise. But what you can spot during listening to it are the vocals. They\u2019re very\u2026 funny. They sound like Clive Archer / Jesus Christ was trying to be as brutal and noisy as it gets, but it was coming out just funny. (Especially \u201cTakes me HAYAH!\u201d) In general, everything about those rehearsals is like that. The instruments are played in a chaotic way and it\u2019s audible that those were only the roots of the songs that later made it to Welcome to Hell and Black Metal albums. But not all of them made it, because the last song of this session is the band\u2019s self-titled track Venom which, as far as I know, was never released besides the demos. I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s pretty interesting. But I\u2019ll write more about it later. What is also interesting about these recordings is how the versions of Buried Alive and Raise the Dead are. Buried Alive is only 1 minute long(!) and is connected with the latter, they\u2019re like a one song. And this one minute of \u201cBuried Alive\u201d is only the beginning of the 04:19 song that is on the Black Metal album. I\u2019m glad that they expanded this song as it came out being a masterpiece, one of the few Venom songs that after all these years still stand out. But despite these recordings are chaotic and almost unmusical, I\u2019m not telling that they\u2019re unnecessary in the compilation. As they are probably the first (or one of the very first) Venom recordings ever, it\u2019s great to know how the band sounded in the very beginning and how they evolved during the first years of the career, even while being \u201cthe best band with the worst musicians\u201d.\n\nAfter raw 1979 rehearsal recordings, what comes next are 1980 Impulse Studios - \u00a350 demos which are the opposite of the first tracks and the best part of the whole release. \u00a350 demos are 6 tracks, 5 of them later became the highlights of the Welcome to Hell album and the sixth one is the song Venom that I mentioned above. And we\u2019ve come to the part when I tell that this demo is in my opinion better than Welcome to Hell. Let me explain what I mean. Firstly, the sound and the production. Everything is very well hearable, everything sounds clear and beautiful, but still ugly and obscure on the other hand. Especially worth noting are Cronos\u2019 bass lines. Before listening to this demo, I used to think that he\u2019s an average bass player. But probably it\u2019s just the production of the albums that made his lines sound not interestingly. Secondly, these versions of the songs are in my opinion better than the versions that made it to the full-length, in a large part. Especially Angel Dust. The opening riff is insane! And I\u2019m not sure if in the album version there\u2019s a different riff in this song, or it just sounds differently because of the obscure production. Because, in fact, Welcome to Hell is a demo that was released as an album. I also like Jesus Christ\u2019s vocals a lot. But they are strongly kept in the British heavy metal style and clean, so if he remained the band\u2019s vocalist for \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d there would be no Cronos\u2019 enormously inspiring \u201cpre-growl\u201d. And of course, the full-length has way more songs on it and all of them are very inspiring. I think that it would be great if they recorded the whole Welcome to Hell during this session, but with Cronos on vocals. Another good idea would be to release this demo simply as an EP (after cutting off the unnecessary parts) that would be a \u201cteaser\u201d for the first Venom full-length. But on the other hand, what is beautiful in it is the fact that it\u2019s a rare gem and Welcome to Hell became legendary as it is. But I can\u2019t believe that a demo this great wasn\u2019t released before. And besides the songs later released on the album, there is also the band\u2019s self-titled song. Even though it\u2019s very straightforward and simple, it\u2019s really satisfying, so I don\u2019t know why it (as far as I know) didn\u2019t make it to any Venom\u2019s studio release. I also know that these demos were remastered and as they sound great, it\u2019s worth noting that not only the demo is good, but also good job was done in preparing this compilation.\n\nThe third part of the compilation are the recordings from 1980 Impulse Studio Demo Session, already with Cronos on vocals. They are similar to the \u00a350 ones, but the sound of the drums is way better, more generic. Obviously as Cronos took over the microphone, the vocals are throatier. We hear Angel Dust for the third time in the compilation (and the \u00a350 version remains my favorite) and Raise the Dead and Red Light Fever that were also in the 1979 rehearsals, so we can hear how they have changed during not more than a year. They both became way better of course, but the reverb in the chorus of Raise the Dead came out being funny and pointless. Also, the bass tone is a bit disturbing here. But those recordings are very interesting to listen to and are an important part in the band\u2019s history. The last track on Sons of Satan is the demo version of Venom\u2019s progressive anthem At War with Satan from 1983. It\u2019s good to know how it sounded in the beginning, although in contrast to the \u00a350 demos it\u2019s not something I will normally listen to, because it\u2019s recorded strangely \u2013 the guitar is louder in the left speaker and there is a part when everything sounds muffled, like it was glued from several different parts (and probably it was).\n\nI won\u2019t say anything surprising when I\u2019ll say that those demos are a must-listen for every Venom fan. But I\u2019ll also tell that every fan of extreme metal that would like to know how the very roots of their beloved genres sounded like should check them out. Rating musically, I would rate the 1979 demos 2/10, but it\u2019s not the point of this release. Its goal is to share with the fans the band\u2019s early recordings that used to be rare or unreleased and doing that, show an important part of the band\u2019s history and their evolution. And this release fulfills this goal very well. And as 1979 and later 1980 and 1983 recordings are more of a fun facts to me, the \u00a350 1980 demo is very satisfying to listen to and I feel that I\u2019ll keep coming back to it even more often than to Welcome to Hell album, which ironically has worse production.\n\nOriginally written for Tony Blackthrasher on Instagram and Facebook and The Metal Observer.\n",
        "\nI obviously had to give my take on this particular album since it always had some debates surrounding it. Venom came out with an album called \"Black Metal\" and suddenly some people claimed that Venom is playing black metal. Maybe at the time it was considered that way, but of course, things has evolved and by modern standards, it's not even close to what its name suggest. Venom being from United Kingdom, they also got tagged into the NWOBHM. Did Venom sounded like a typical NWOBHM band? Definitely not. However, the approach taken on their music was still relatable. Inspired by bands like Black Sabbath or Mot\u00f6rhead, the main characteristic of Venom at the time was its primitive sound, especially on the first album, \"Welcome to Hell\" in 1981. Being one of the first band to fully use the satanic image, they went on to influence a countless amount of thrash and extreme metal bands that formed in the early to mid 80s. The \"Black Metal\" album was released shortly after the debut in 1982 and managed to gain enough attention for the band to get lot of controversies because of their image.\n\nFirst and foremost, this album has always been my favorite of Venom even if \"Welcome to Hell\" is still a release I enjoy too. The sound featured on \"Black Metal\" is very interesting in a sense that it's raw and primitive for its time but it always sounded still great to me, especially when you are used to listen to bad produced records. What we have on this album is quite a bunch of material considering there are 11 tracks and nearly 40 minutes of playtime. I like how this album starts off with the most rubbish sound within the album title song \"Black Metal\" and then the first riff kick-off and shit is getting real now, it's fast-paced and evil sounding. This song became a classic with its catchy chorus and famous \"Lay down your soul to the gods rock `n' roll\" line. The music being generally heavy as fuck regarding the riffs as seen in \"To Hell and Back\", there are also some quite entertaining solos here and there. One of my favorite track on this record is definitely \"Buried Alive\" because of its overall grim atmosphere and great guitar parts from \"Mantas\". This album also features the best vocal performance by \"Cronos\", at least in my book, his voice has a punkish tone and uses it aggressively and even sound dramatic in songs like \"Leave Me In Hell\" or \"Sacrifice\".\n\nWhen it comes to drums of \"Abaddon\", it's mostly fast-paced and does a pretty great job at speed metal tracks like \"Heaven's On Fire\", which has a pretty significant Mot\u00f6rhead vibe on with that classic song structure type. On this album, we also have the famous track \"Countess Bathory\" which is a favorite among most people who listen to Venom. However, I don't seem to enjoy it as much as others for some reason. I think i've grew tired of it at some point because of its repetitiveness. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good track, but I just can't seem to enjoy it as much as I did when I first started listening to this album. However, \"Don't Burn the Witch\" for instance, I really like the main riff and most likely because of it being very similar to \"Born for Burning\" of Bathory. Of course, this album had to have a track like \"Teacher's pet\" that doesn't sound credible at all, despite having some decent riffs, but the overall mood is bad to me nonetheless. The preview of the \"At War with Satan\" doesn't show much as awell and I didn't really pay attention to it.\n\nWhat is really missing from this album is some rhythmic guitar parts during the guitar solos. It sounds a little vacant when there's only bass and drums filling in during those times, at least the bass is heard perfectly in the mix. Other than these details, I don't have many bad things to say about \"Black Metal\" since its production value is quite great and fits quite well with the music on it. In a sum up, this album is very enjoyable for what it is, taking into account that it's an innovative record with its multiples characteristics that were later replicated on lots of extreme metal music. I always end up coming back to this album from time to time and give it a casual listen, definitely something I would recommend to anyone that is looking for the origin of thrash, death or black metal.\n\nFavorite tracks: \n\nBlack Metal\nBuried Alive\nDon't Burn the Witch\nLeave Me in Hell\nRaise the Dead\n",
        "\nFirst of all, I must admit black metal is not my cup of tea at all. But I also must admit (and I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me) that this is not black metal at all, not the way we think of black metal nowadays at the very least. I have always found Venom's sound as a rawer and even faster version of Mot\u00f6rhead. Nobody would say Mot\u00f6rhead is black metal, huh? Back in that time (it was 1982), this was surely a very raw and savage band, and although they were originally labelled as NWOBHM, there're a lot of obvious influences from rock'n'roll to even blues (yeah, check \"Teacher's Pet\" out and the crazy blues interlude). They called the album \"Black Metal\", and they have been a very influential band in the development of the style, but I don't think they were founding any black metal sub-genre at all, just like Helloween or Running Wild never played death metal despite the fact they both appeared on a compilation called \"Death Metal\". Some other similarities with bands like Saxon prevent them from being labelled as black metal... Anyway, and regardless the black metal, I find MA's definition quite appropriate (NWOBHM/Speed metal).\n\nThe overall result of the album is kind of a fast-paced rock'n'roll-based metal with a raw and brute sound. It starts up with an electrical machine sound, it seems like a driller making a hole in a wall, but it was actually vocalist and bassist Cronos using a chainsaw in order to make his way through a door in the recording studio, then \"Black Metal\" fades in and bursts in one of the most intense tracks of the album, and one of all-time Venom's classics.\n\nHaving only one guitar player (oppossing to most metal bands, which have 2 guitarists), guitars sound quite weak at times, especially when soloing, as just bass and drums are backing the guitar solo. Maybe this could have been resolved by dubbing an additional rhythm guitar track only for backing the solos, thus giving a thicker and heavier sound to the whole record, just like other bands with only one guitar player. Oppossing to this is bass guitar; plugging it to a guitar amp instead of a bass one makes it sound rawer with no need of distortion. At this point, I'm not really sure whether the bass is distorted or not, but anyway this somehow makes up for the lack of a rhythm guitar during the solos. Drums are mostly fast-paced, Abaddon has an obvious preference for sped-up classical rock 'n' roll patterns, but there're also heavy and slower, nearly doomy songs like \"Buried Alive\", where there's an anguishing and opressive atmosphere like being actually buried alive. and a double-bass drum section (notice, not blast beats, just double bass) in the chorus of \"Countess Bathory\". Cronos' vocals are raw and throaty, either death-like growls nor blackish screeches, quite akin to Lemmy's voice but deeper and maybe less harsh though.\n\nVenom's lyrics and imagery was way too shocking at that time, although nowadays it may seem quite comical, nearly laughable. Their lyrics talk about topics in rock 'n' roll: girls, sex, motorbikes, leather and playing, adding that excessive dose of blasphemy, Satan and Hell which made them that shocking in their early days. In addition, their imagery in leather gave them a sado-masochistic looking, resulting in a pretty provocative band back in the days. \n\nAll in all, and as I stated before, I have never found any trace of black metal in any of Venom's albums. The influences I see range from blues and rock 'n' roll to NWOBHM, and I find similarities with bands like Mot\u00f6rhead, Saxon, old Manowar or even Judas Priest, rather than Mayhem, Emperor, Immortal or Darkthrone, or does anybody out there think singing about Satan and Hell is enough to be labelled as black metal? Of course not.\n",
        "\nIn 1982, Venom released their second and most important album ever, Black Metal. This album was highly influential towards thrash metal, death metal, and the genre that it coined the term for, black metal. Musically, Black Metal is neither of these genres as the album is primarily classified as NWOBHM and speed metal. Just like its predecessor Welcome to Hell, it also had a low-budget raw production that many black metal bands took influence from.\n\nYou will notice Black Metal's influence once you start up the title track. The guitars have a sound similar to Mot\u00f6rhead's music, which is probably coincidental as Mot\u00f6rhead was the first metal band to embrace punk rock elements. This song is literally their \"Ace of Spades\". \"To Hell and Back\" isn't as fast as \"Black Metal\", but it contains a lot rock 'n' roll riffs that make it a good song to drive to. \"Teacher's Pet\" is a hilarious song that lyrically mocks female teachers that engage in pedophilia. In hindsight, this song has a lot of importance due to there being a lot of cases of this nowadays, especially in the UK. \"Countess Bathory\" is also worth mentioning since the Swedish black metal band Bathory named themselves after this song. It's also the grooviest number on here with the song being kinda like a predecessor to Mot\u00f6rhead's \"Orgasmatron\".\n\nJust like with Welcome to Hell, Cronos sings with a punk rock style of rasp on Black Metal. A lot of extreme metal vocalists, even Tom G. Warrior would give their thanks to Cronos for pioneering extreme metal vocals. Cronos is also a competent bass player in this era of Venom with the bass being noticeably audible for an album with low quality production. You can hear Cronos' bass riffs on pretty much every song. Mantas' guitar playing is mostly influenced by punk rock on Black Metal but it's clear that he doesn't mind doing ballads as seen on \"Buried Alive\". Mantas also delivers some really cool guitar solos such as on \"Raise the Dead\" and \"Heaven's on Fire\". Abaddon's drumming style is arguably one of the first metal drummers to utilize double bass drumming which was popularized by Dave Lombardo of Slayer. He also varies the tempo on songs like \"To Hell and Back\" and \"Sacrifice\" that exhibit mid-pace beats.\n\nBlack Metal might be called a thrash metal album or even a black metal album. However, at the end of the day, I consider it an early example of extreme metal. Unfortunately, this album along with predecessor Welcome to Hell were really the only masterpieces Venom ever put out. Even though Black Metal ends with a preview of \"At War with Satan, it's not worth checking out the album At War with Satan due to the significant drop in quality. Black Metal is a landmark album in metal history, and although it doesn't have good production, it makes up for it with its sheer influence. Every extreme metal band, even Metallica have cited this album as an influence which goes to show you how important this record is. Enough said, if you need your NWOBHM to be angry and raw, give this album a shot.\n",
        "\n\"It went plastic in '94/Oh my god you're such a bore/If you don't understand what I mean/Fucking listen to Venom's 'Acid Queen' - Darkthrone, \"Raised On Rock.\"\n\nWell, Fenriz, I really don't know what you mean. I can't tell if that line was intended to be a criticism or an endorsement of the aforementioned song, but either way, I know that it's part of a very enjoyable single. \"Die Hard\" is yet another of Venom's singles that never made it onto a studio album. This time around, the title track is a little more accessible than the lo fi frenzy of \"Bloodlust\" or the nightmarish pandemonium that is \"Warhead.\" \n\n\"Die Hard\" is a bit more anthemic and fist pumping than your average Venom song. The chorus is absolutely irresistible, as jarring as the backing vocals might be at first. Mantas' guitar still has the trademark buzzsaw sound that gives the band it's bite, and Cronos adds his own sleaze and bile to the lyrics. The guitar solo isn't too great, and is mostly just a series of random notes (and not in Mantas' usual charming way). Ot seems a bit shoehorned in just for the sake of having a guitar solo, but it doesn't take away too much from the song. It's a Venom song, so you know the music isn't going to be very complex, but the punk-like simplicity works in its favor here. The main verse riff is one that you've probably heard a million times in a million other songs, yet Venom makes it their own.\n\n\"Acid Queen\" doesn't quite live up to the A-Side, but it's no slouch. If \"Die Hard\" falls into the \"Satanism\" category for Venom lyrics, than Acid Queen falls into the other half of their material. Sex, drugs, rock 'n roll. It alternates between mid-paced verses and a thrashy, almost hardcore chorus. Cronos sounds almost out of control and drunk, though this isn't necessarily to the detriment of the song. It lacks the catchiness of \"Die Hard,\" and it doesn't make as much of an impression, but it's still a lot of fun.\n\nVenom are especially good in small doses. Their singles are perfect examples of this, so check out \"Die Hard.\"\n",
        "\nMan, Venom was really on a roll for the first couple years. You'd be hard pressed to find another metal band with such a strong run of non-album singles (usually I leave that the singles game up to punk, but Venom did it surprisingly well for a metal band). \"Bloodlust\" is perhaps my favorite of the A-sides. It's raw, aggressive, and packed with energy. This is Cronos at his most menacing, he sounds like a man possessed. In addition, Mantas dishes out some of his best guitar work, with galloping riffs and wild soloing. I'll admit, I have a soft spot for when a singer calls out the name of the guitarist before a solo, and this is possibly my favorite example in all of music, closely followed by the mellow \"rock me, Joe\" in \"Monkey Gone To Heaven.\"\n\nThe B-side, \"In Nomine Satanas,\" is more of a slow burner, being more midpaced and restrained than the A-side, but still very intense and heavy. I particularly love the opening riff, which will refuse to leave your head for quite a while. It's not quite as strong as \"Bloodlust,\" but that's a pretty high bar to reach, and it's still definitely worth the listen.\n\n\"Bloodlust\" is 2 songs that would have fit in easily on any Venom album, and the fact that the albums were as good as they are without any of these non-album singles show the sheer songwriting talent that the band had during this time. For anyone getting into Venom, don't pass up \"Bloodlust.\"\n",
        "\nThe two sides of the \"Warhead\" 7\" represent Venom at their two extremes. On one hand, you've got the title track. \"Warhead\" doesn't sound too much like most other Venom songs, eschewing speed and sleazy charm for an all-out sludgy nightmare. The drums pound slowly like harbingers of the apocalypse, the dissonant riff comes in slowly and ominously, and Cronos sounds like a man possessed. You can barely understand the lyrics as he groans and shrieks like a madman. Although this approach wasn't very common for Venom, it works quite well, and \"Warhead\" is a proper nightmarish ride for three and a half minutes.\n\nOn the other hand, you've got \"Lady Lust,\" the b-side. This is more in line with the sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll songs that Venom was known for, but it's a little more extreme. The guitar sounds like a buzzsaw, and the drums are drenched in reverb, not unlike the production on \"Under The Sign Of The Black Mark.\" This song is a little catchier than \"Warhead,\" and Cronos' voice is as disgustingly great is over, dripping with sleaze and oozing, well, venom, I guess.\n\nThis is a great single, and a great showcase of Venom at their more doomy and ominous, as well as the trademark \"Welcome To Hell\" approach made faster, more aggressive, and just plain nightmarish. Be sure not to pass this one up!\n",
        "\nAny music critic who dares to take himself seriously must acknowledge the impact, influence and quality of early Venom's music. Without this album, it's follow up Black Metal, and bits and pieces of the two after that, so called \"extreme metal\" would not exist. End of argument. Period. Finito.\n\nYet, as important as it is to extreme metal, I always classified Venom under the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. In terms of songwriting, there really isn't that much of a structural difference between this and say, the Angel Witch debut, the Iron Maiden debut and all the other cornerstones of the movement. There is still very much a rock & roll feel to this album. It just so happens to be stretched to what was perceived to be the absolute limit within those parameters. What was once way out there becomes normal, so you push out further, lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nNonetheless, Welcome to Hell is simply too historically important to not be considered black metal or even thrash metal. Not quite death metal, we would need the likes of Celtic Frost, the German thrash scene and Slayer before that branch of the tree can hang on its own. Not to mention that it's the lack of technical proficiency that gives this a darker edge over most of the classic heavy metal albums that were emerging from 1979-1981. To Venom's credit, the sloppiness never derails any of the momentum of the tracks with regard to tempo. On the other hand, while I'm by no means a guitar wizard, I can't help but imagine quite a few Dream Theater techies viewing the approach of Mantas (and Cronos) as the equivalent of taking your own feces and blood and smearing it all over themselves and the walls. But hey, fuck em. Breaking the rules used to be a good thing in metal.\n\nHighlights include Witching Hour, a seminal, violent, fast hellspawn cry that no doubt annoyed Lemmy to no end with whisperings of \"is Motorhead going to be dethroned as the baddest band in the land?\" But don't be thinking that for all of Venom's bluster they were only a one speed band. One Thousand Days of Sodom and In Nomine Satanas (a non-album single that should be on most remastered versions) are midpaced demonic political rallies, with Count Cronos, Vampire Supreme rallying the troops with a plan of attack to be carried out when all hell breaks loose. There are some deviations from the theme, such as odes to prostitution and angel dust, which the likes of Varg and Euronymous probably didn't appreciate in the middle of their seances. But dare I say, that these \"other\" songs (and yes I include Teacher's Pet here) gave early Venom an edge that allowed the listeners to meditate over earthly pleasures in addition to unearthly ones whilst sitting Indian style in the center of the pentagram.\n\nWhile perhaps not the most entertaining album of 1981 (the practice of releasing better songs as non-album singles and slight redundancies keep this from getting in the mid 80s), Welcome To Hell was unquestionably the most transformative. These days it will appeal the most to thrashers. If you think you're extreme and you don't own this, you're not.\n",
        "\nIn a 2008 interview with Guitar World, Venom frontman Cronos gave his thoughts on the NWOBHM that was unfolding around the time Venom formed: \"I would see all these new bands coming in who thought they were different, but to me they were just younger versions of Judas Priest or Saxon or Iron Maiden. I just didn\u2019t see any originality in these bands, and I wanted my band to be unlike anything else around.\" \n\nAnd Venom truly was unlike any other band at the time. They took the existing structure of heavy metal and made it leaner and meaner, stripping it down while simultaneously cranking up the aggression and primal ferocity. \n\nFollowing a 20 second intro that sounds like grinding sheet metal, the band breaks into the title track, which serves as a sort of mission statement. The drums bash out a basic 1-2 beat that sounds like a caveman beating a log as Cronos' hoarse rasp implores the listener to \"lay down your soul to the gods rock n' roll.\" Guitarist Mantas' chromatic shredding creates a wild and chaotic atmosphere, setting the path for future fret-abusers like Kerry King and Trey Azagthoth. \n\nBut even without taking its historical significance into account, \"Black Metal\" is just a great album on its own merits. Mantas shows off his ability to write some delightfully sinister riffs on tracks like the slow, eerie \"Countess Bathory\" and the thrashy \"Don't Burn The Witch.\" Cronos was a vocal powerhouse in his prime, with his throaty bellow adding flavor to his tales of sex, drugs, rock n' roll, and Satan. \"Buried Alive\" proves to be one of the standout tracks, taking a slower, more ominous path, until it leads into the thrashy \"Raise The Dead.\" \n\nThe album perfectly demonstrate's Venom's penchant for writing catchy, anthemic choruses, even if it often tends to just be the song title shouted repeatedly. Iwill say, however, that \"Teacher's Pet\" is a bit of an outlier, although the riffs may be good, the GET YER TITS OUT FOR THE LADS breakdown is a bit much. It's got a nice guitar solo, at least.\n\nThe production isn't quite as muddled as \"Welcome To Hell,\" but it's still cavernous and raw, with a filthy guitar tone and deep, thudding drums.\n\nWith \"Black Metal,\" Venom pulled off a mighty feat: They created an album that had an insurmountable influence, but was also just a flat out great album. For anyone who just wants to appreciate a record filled with great riffs and just plain fun, \"Black Metal\" is for you.\n\nSource: https://www.guitarworld.com/features/venoms-cronos-guitar-world-interview\n",
        "\nVenom were at the top of their game in 1984. They had established themselves as kings of the early extreme metal scene with a huge fan-base in both sides of the Atlantic. The critical dismissal had given its place to worldwide recognition. However, these were hard times to read for a metal band. On one hand you had the Iron Maiden, Manowar, Judas Priest brand of heavy metal and on the other hand you had the newly formed thrash movement, originated by Venom themselves. It should be noted that these were still early days for metal and for some listeners even Iron Maiden was considered \u201cextreme\u201d. Venom had reached a crossroads on their career. They could easily ride either direction. They chose neither.\n\nAt War with Satan contains some of the best songwriting of the band. Their sound hasn\u2019t progressed much; it still sounds rough and unfiltered but in a way that makes the single guitar and bass work together beautifully, without the tight guitar doubletracking you would find in more elaborate productions. It appears that it was a conscious choice to remain sonically primitive, as the band retained that sound for the rest of their career. Kind of what Motorhead was about too, which happens to be Venom\u2019s biggest inspiration.\n\nThe opening track, the 20-minute long epic At War with Satan is a wasted opportunity. There are at least 3 amazing songs crammed in here, some of the best riffs the band has written that practically go to waste in the length of the song. With Kill Em All out and Ride the Lightning around the corner, that epic song gave out the wrong message. A punk attitude was the favour of the day, not prog tendencies. I strongly feel that if they had made songs out of this mess, At War\u2026 would have been much bigger. I do remember back in the day refusing to get the album just because of that song. The B side is excellent; hell, it starts off with Rip Ride an amazing thrash tune, probably my all-time favourite Venom song, followed by an array of some of the finest Venom material ever put to tape.\n\nPrior to At War with Satan's release Metallica were the opening act for Venom's Seven Dates of Hell tour, introducing the young American band to the European audiences. It wouldn\u2019t take long before the youngsters would catapult themselves to heights unreachable by their former idols. Had Venom realised the importance of thrash back in 1984, they could have ridden that rocket.\n\nAside from all that, At War With Satan is probably Venom\u2019s finest hour. The songwriting and execution are top-notch and the energy emitted is of a band confident in its accomplishments. Unfortunately it all went downhill from then on\u2026\n",
        "\nV.E.N.O. f**king M.!\n\nCronos is back once again. I am sceptical after the last EP and especially in view of the fact that all its three examples of mediocrity have found a place on \"Storm the Gates\". Thus, a 95 + X % rating would be ridiculous, even for someone like me who once was a Venom fanboy and now has become a Venom fan-grandfather. Cronos will never again release a new \"At War with Satan\", but a more than solid full-length should be possible. Maybe the droning, more or less rumbling sound of the album does not meet the greatest expectations, yet it embodies the typical flair of the noisy British legend pretty well. Needless to say that Venom do not concentrate on technical tricks and so the production must be considered as suitable for this group - even though it would be a shame for any other formation due to its lack of sharpness and precision. But let the truth be told without any kind of cynicism. \"Storm the Gates\" (by the way, nice artwork) has an acceptable production in objective terms, no more, no less.\n\n13 songs seem to be an omen for creativity, but honestly speaking, in the case of Venom, this would be a daring thesis. The pounding, mid-paced compositions of \"Storm the Gates\" sound antiquated. Cronos seems to have fallen out of time and the disappointing EP does not remain an isolated case. The album lacks energy and spontaneity. I miss outstanding pieces which would be able to challenge the highlights of the band's back catalogue. Generally speaking, the here presented tunes enlarge the catalogue of the trio, but they do not enrich it. It is truly bitter, but the majority of the songs raise the question of Venom's right of existence in 2018. I hate to say it, but 36 years after the groundbreaking \"Black Metal\" and 34 years after the visionary \"At War with Satan\", this new work does not deserve a comparable attribute, even though I am not speaking about a complete flop. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that the entire work has almost nothing in common with black metal. Even the comparatively diabolic atmosphere of its predecessor, remember \"Smoke\", \"Evil Law\" or the title track of \"From the Very Depths\" is missing.\n\nSome good riffs have been created and they are responsible for the fact that the album does not drown in the big sea of meaninglessness. If one accepts that Venom are seemingly no longer able to convey a diabolic aura, one can enjoy some tracks and have fun. \"Over My Dead Body\" marks the most vigorous song, it is almost an explosive eruption in the context of this album. (But its lyrics prove evidence that the band has lost the orientation. Cronos moans about omnipresent propaganda and I really don't see a link to the \"Satanic\" topics that made this band once great. I am sure that Satan tears will extinguish the fires of hell as soon as he listens to this work.) \"Notorious\", \"I, Dark Lord\" or the dense and robust \"Immortal\" score with strong choruses and fine guitar work. The voice of unbreakable gnome at the microphone also can be mentioned as a plus point, because he still has a certain charisma which fits the musical approach. Nevertheless, there is not an ounce of originality or creative insanity. It is rather an album for obedient civil servants. Teachers, employees at the cadastral office and the part-time workers of the urban library will enjoy the fact that \"Storm the Gates\" somehow reflects their personalities. No unnecessary stress, please.\n\nVenom's once gargantuan reputation is the main reason why the band is still alive, even though it is laudable that they still try to forge new strong albums. \"From the Very Depths\" was an excellent result, at least from my point of view. But here we have to face a work that holds no components in order to blow the listener away. Too many run-of-the-mill pieces mirror exactly the feature that all artists, but especially Venom, always intended to avoid since the beginning of time. They are ordinary. The closing title track is the final disappointment. I always thought a title track should be something special, but here we have just another piece of more or less structured noise. The once polarizing pioneers deliver songs which are too good to hate them and too bad to love them. I will walk the way of Venom with them until the bitter end, come hell or high water. But it seems as if the end is coming nearer and nearer.\n\nV.E.N.O.f**king M.?\n",
        "\nI'm finding myself unable to maintain my preferred structure for this review and this time it's because I simply don't think I can describe this music without using unkind descriptors.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this album is really bad production. For the sake of context - I review every album with over-ear headphones \u2013 and this album has the strange distinction of being the only album I can remember thinking it sounds like there is just a hole in the center of the music. The drums are far in the back \u2013 the guitar is thinly plastered on the sides, and the vocals float somewhere above. This leaves a void in the center of the music \u2026 it feels so empty. It leaves the whole thing sounding weak and timid. The drums are just awful sounding. The cymbals have no brightness or attack to them, the snare sounds like wet cardboard, and on top of that, they don't sound very balanced in relation to one another. This sounds like a case of \u201cwe used to record in analogue in a musty basement somewhere and now we record in some million-dollar studio using mostly digital junk, and we try to make it sound like it used to but our producer has no fucking clue what he's doing.\u201d Some of the weakest, dumbest sounding production I've heard in a long time. Just fucking terrible.\n\nNow, the music. Not gonna lie, I can't remember the last time I listened to Venom, but I definitely enjoyed them many years ago \u2013 but I don't remember them making such laughably weak riffs. The vocals are kind of like Dave Mustaine's British cousin, crossed with James Hetfield stuck in a well, crossed with Mille from Kreator with a bad hangover. His inflection really reminds me of Mustaine \u2013 which is probably the only nice thing I can say about any individual performance on this album. The production mars even this though, because the vocals are laden with reverb and really are inconsistent in the mix.\n\nThe riffs feel like they were written with the expressed rules of nothing over 4 chords, no unique rhythms, and being generic enough to match the borderline self-parody of the lyrics. The riffs are just so rudimentary. They're kind of thrashy, kind of speed metal, kind of punky \u2013 but really just so bland it's hard to commit to really putting them into any genre. We The Loud sounds like a scrapped Black Flag song. 100 Miles to Hell has this completely inoffensive hard rock, \u201ctuff guy\u201d thing going on that is what I imagine Nickleback would sound like if they just recorded a song with these production values. Beaten to a Pulp sounds like a grunge song with the addition of double bass and some slightly faster strumming patterns. There's not a single riff here I haven't heard before \u2013 with or without some dressing on it. I mean they're just so simple, stripped down. It's like a sculpture that's been sand-blasted to just be kind of an amorphous blob. There's no defining features! What's worse is they're just so unenthusiastic. Tired. Lethargic. The guitar tone has had the same sand-blasted treatment apparently because it has no bite or edge to it. \n\nThis is so bad, I'm itching to get this review over with and shut this trash off. It doesn't sound like a lick of effort went into this. It's just unbearable. Even if it wasn't so off-putting in it's clearly zero-effort riffs, and bewildering production values - I still don't see the point in an album like this. Is it heavy? No. Is it fast? No. Is it atmospheric? No. Is it unique? No. Well written? No. That special je ne sais quoi? Certainly not. Is it carrying on the legacy of a seminal metal band? One would hope not. If this is their legacy, consider it forever tarnished. From hall of fame to hall of shame.\n\nIt's stylistically unremarkable, tired, hackneyed heard-it-one-million-times-before riffs - some of which are closer to radio-friendly rock than metal, impossibly bad production and passionless, lazy execution. And even if I've heard these riffs a million times, I think I've hardly heard them this poorly executed. It's stupefying in the sheer lack of quality in it's riffs. If they were actively trying to parody their own brand of metal, I don't know how they would out-do this. I just don't know how it could be any worse. If there weren't a handful of albums I simply dislike more than this - this album could theoretically get a goose egg. A 0/100. It's that bad.\n",
        "\nVenom's music is simple. The riffs are thunderous. The solos are distorted. The bass guitar is loud. The drums are heavy. The vocals are raw. The lyrics are nasty. The record sounds as if it had been recorded with a potato in some shabby basement in a dirty suburb of Newcastle. The band has kept playing the same type of music since its existence. Calling it the Mot\u00f6rhead of thrash metal would be a quite accurate description. Despite the limits of its musicianship, the trio has such a unique sound that it doesn't really matter. You know what to expect from a Venom record and this is exactly what you get. This works well enough for a while but isn't outstanding either. It's passable.\n\n''100 Miles to Hell'' convinces with its angry lyrics that underline the band's mean punk attitude. ''Beaten to a Pulp'' does its title justice and is one of the most brutal songs on the record. ''Destroyer'' is slower and has a quite eerie atmosphere which makes it stand out but it doesn't lack the dirty brutality of the other tracks and blends in nicely. The riffs in ''Immortal'' are the most energetic and memorable on the record.\n\nStorm the Gates obviously also includes some fillers as many tracks sound quite exchangeable. ''Bring Out Your Dead'' starts a little bit too abruptly and could have been played by three teenagers in an unclean rehearsal space in the early eighties that have only been playing their instruments for about a month. ''Suffering Dictates'' seems to suffer from a particularly terrible production even by the group's low standards but that might have been the band's intention as well. ''We the Loud'' might have been an attempt to create a new band anthem but sounds almost amusingly amateurish and stereotypical.\n\nIn the end, Venom's Storm the Gates is interesting for those who like thrash metal of the early years with an angry punk spirit. The music obviously doesn't have anything to do with black metal except for a few minor references to the occult in the lyrics. This record is violent fun that entertains for a while but ends up being forgotten as soon as it's over.\n",
        "\nIf the uninitiated seeks out the earliest black metal recording to see how the cold, hypnotic, romantic sound of Filosofem began, their expectations will be let down when they hear Demon. Venom's place in the black metal canon, while being unquestionable in the 80s, became much more controversial after two decades of second wave black metal more or less redefining the term. But Venom are not simply a band that invented the name of the genre, they are the utter root of everything that was to come. They brought evil into metal, before there was any Slayer. Black Sabbath invoked Satan as something to be feared, Venom identified with Satan, and a radical change occurred as evil is embraced (however tongue-in-cheek).\n\nThe sound is raw and pummeling, similar to Motorhead and the most \"extreme\" metal of the day. That driving pulse would be adapted by Bathory and others later, along with the imagery and the rawness, although carried even deeper into Hell. Bathory would introduce witchy vocals, but Venom already have a scratchy, growly vocal style that sounds more decidedly evil than the equivalent roughness in Motorhead and the punk scene.\n\nRaise the Dead is the only lyrically black metal song, the other tracks being more radical versions of what sleazy hard rock bands were doing at the time. Sonically the songs are still on the heavy (non-extreme) metal side, but the vocals especially in Red Light Fever are not miles apart from the style of Hellhammer or early Bathory. Some of the barks in Raise the Dead too, especially the \"dead!\" part sound like full on black metal, worlds apart from Motorhead (Venom's assumed prime influence). The vocals on this demo are not by Cronos but by some guy calling himself \"Jesus Christ\" (Clive Archer), though they are practically indistinguishable.\n\nYou don't have to think of this as black metal or listen to it as black metal, the songs make more sense on a heavy metal or hard rock playlist than side by side with Deathspell Omega, but it is undeniable that the very first seeds of black metal can be found on this demo, and it's not just a matter of lyrics and imagery. That being said, if you doubt the authenticity of Venom as a black metal band, check out the picture of vocalist 'Jesus Christ' on his page here, taken around the time this demo was recorded I believe.\n",
        "\nThis mini album is a hidden gem in my opinion. It is the very first studio release after the 1995 reunion of Venom's best known line-up - the \"power trio\" Cronos-Mantas-Abaddon which left an undisputedly undeletable mark on the whole metal scene. Tons of bands have formed in the wake of Venom's lyrical themes and imagery, but let's face it, the impact they had on music at the time (most likely without immediately knowing it) is unprecedented within heavy metal; I would dare to say that neither Sabbath had caused an \"epidemic\" of such proportions.\n\nWhat we have here is an improved recording quality, which is a good thing if you consider that all their successful releases were rather lo-fi. There are five songs on the EP - four re-recorded old hits and a preview of a newly recorded track that would appear one year later in the last full-length produced by this line-up, Cast in Stone. \n\nWhereas the re-recorded In Nomine Satanas and Black Metal keep pretty much the same tempo, 7 Gates of Hell is faster than the original version, and the new Welcome to Hell is instead slightly slower, making this version more \"hard\". This is my favourite track on the record, and I actually prefer this version to the original. The final line Cronos yells, \"Welcome to fucking Hell!\", adds even more awesomeness to the song, and makes you realise that he still had it all - and still got it today. From this moment, in almost all of their live shows they have performed this version of the song. \n\nThe guitar playing is still fast and altogether rough, as it was in the golden years of Venom, whereas the drums seem to lack that energy which once was a trademark of their style. Nevertheless, if you like Venom as much as I do, I definitely recommend you to check this out; you won't be disappointed.\n",
        "\nI couldn\u2019t care less when Cronos left his comrades after the divisive \u201cCalm Before the Storm\u201d as I was one of the few metal heads in my hometown who never became very fond of the fathers of black metal and their rowdy exploits. It wasn\u2019t a big deal at all as something had to happen in the band\u2019s camp since they were losing it way before an actual threat (the grunge/groove/industrial wave) had even started looming on the horizon; and a next very probable step seemed to be a real cold lake\u2026 sorry, shower poured over the more or less disillusioned fanbase\u2026\n\nThankfully, such a horrifying scenario was postponed, and also permanently erased as it became evident later, as the band pulled themselves together, not without the help of Mantas who decided to return for at least one more spell. It looked like the good old Venom, only without Cronos of course, and Tony Dolan aka the Demolition Man from Atomkraft filling in the vacated position behind the mike, the ship was ready to enter 90\u2019s waters. And it did, first with the quite convincing \u201cPrime Evil\u201d where finally full-fledged thrash was the order of the way; then with the marginally weaker and mellower, but still entertaining \u201cTemples of Ice\u201d.\n\nChapter III from the Dolan series was the album reviewed here that is perhaps the only Venom release at that stage which had no expectations to fulfil whatsoever: the new vogues were already a fact, 80\u2019s veterans were shedding their skin left and right, the interest in their feats was fading fast... In other words, the \u201canything goes\u201d spirit was running rampant freeing the musicians from any obligations to audience, critics, and even themselves. In this train of thought albums released at that time shouldn\u2019t be judged so harshly since without any tension to keep the band members on their toes, the level of song-writing and compositional execution had dropped way beyond the masterpiece-level standards\u2026 and fast.\n\nNot that Venom were ever anywhere near those standards, even during their more successful early years, but at the same time it\u2019s hard to point at any album they\u2019ve released as an actual flop despite the number of fans who swear by the mentioned \u201cCalm Before the Storm\u201d as being one... No, not really, and the one here isn\u2019t either although it\u2019s far from a glorious epitaph to the Tony Dolan period. Like the previous instalment already suggested, thrash isn\u2019t the ruling force here anymore as the band have obviously had their fun with it and were more interested in producing larger-than-life stylistic amalgams either because of a lack of ideas, or due to their decision to join the \u201canything goes\u201d carnival\u2026 as the latter option was definitely better than a prime \u201cevil\u201d groove/aggro tribute. \n\nNo, this opus here steers clear from such shite for most of the time and walks its own path, for better or worse, the guys throwing a monstrous doom metal opus (the 8-min \u201cCursed\u201d) at the beginning which later evolves further with more dynamic semi-galloping strokes, but remains on the dark brooding, atmospheric side with haunting keyboard tunes adding more to the instilled strangeness. If the band have suddenly decided to follow their compatriots Cathedral and My Dying Bride down the doomy road, then this newly epitomized approach, based on the opener alone, doesn\u2019t look so shabby at all, but \u201cI'm Paralysed\u201d is a short frolic speedster, the total opposite to the infernal seriousness of the preceding number. So much for conquering the doomy throne \u201cBlack Legions\u201d delineating the album further from the officiant, also ambitious, start being a power/speedy merry-go-rounder influencing \u201cRiddle of Steel\u201d, another brief speed metal-ish hymn. \n\nFrom doom to Atomkraft as this last couple of tracks quite resembles the style of Dolan\u2019s older act, but before the once intimidating stalwarts turn to meek copycats arrives \u201cNeed to Kill\u201d which brings back the thrash with angrier, more belligerent riffs although the latter are stifled in the second half by the downbeat quiet finale. \u201cKissing the Beast\u201d carries on with the speed metal fiesta, a brisk invigorating piece with even a mosh-stirring potential the accumulated inertia killed immediately with the mild heavy rocker \u201cCrucified\u201d, with \u201cShadow King\u201d doing very little to make things right being just a bit more energetic heavy/power metal anthem. \u201cWolverine\u201d is a brave attempt at capturing some magic from the band\u2019s early recordings with boisterous thrashy rhythms, but again, without a distinct follow-up it can only do as much as \u201cClarisse\u201d is a tender lyrical ballad with Dolan semi-reciting throughout, livening up towards the end for a more upbeat heavy epitaph.\n\nA very mixed bag as a whole failing to convince anyone that the Dolan chapter should be prolonged any further as the guys had seemingly exhausted their creative resources by that point, throwing everything into the melting pot as a last resort, befuddling the fans as to what they should expect from this effort: doom, thrash, speed, power, hard rock, or a dubious amalgam of all those styles that the final result had turned out. The seeping gothic atmosphere from the opener was again way more preferable than any grungy/alternative deviations, but mixed with the nearly jocund speedy flair exhibited right after it doesn\u2019t hold water for long as the band were obviously not so fond of keeping it around\u2026 It\u2019s tough to tell what they were fond of at the time, to be honest, except of the already mentioned \u201canything goes\u201d stance. And even if that was the case the English veterans could hardly be considered among its more capable practitioners as the stylistic meanderings here were too arbitrary and inconsecutive to fully disguise the creative cul-de-sac the band were heading towards.\n\nYes, the treacherous wastelands into which the 90\u2019s swiftly turned into spared no one\u2026 regardless of whether you were parading as a most enthusiastic groove/post-thrash advocate or were spitting heroically at the new vogues with bouts of old school metallisms. In order to make heads turn during those times, an old veteran had to produce a minor sensation, like an unheralded reunion with a departed band member, for instance\u2026 It worked for Merciful Fate, it worked for Accept, it had to work for the fathers of black metal, for crying out loud\u2026 And it did, albeit for one isolated stint (\u201cCast in Stone\u201d) as by the time of \u201cResurrection\u201d three years later Abaddon, the only permanent member at that stage, was gone. Mantas followed suit shortly after leaving Cronos the sole remainder of the once glorious power trio\u2026\n\nQuite a saga we have on our hands, with more or less expected twists and turns, and one that goes on till this day, having recently acquired a double-edge status, the new edge named Venom Inc., logically featuring the other two from the original line-up, Mantas and Abaddon that is, plus guess who\u2026 Tony Dolan of course! The Demolition Man is back in action the two fractions having already started to vehemently race each other, leaving the fans guessing as to when a potential merger would take place\u2026maybe at the next wastelands\u2019 expansion? With Cronos on the bass, and Dolan behind the mike\u2026\n",
        "\nFierce, filthy, and full of blasphemy and overboard metal attitude, Welcome to Hell by Venom was a landmark change for metal in the early 1980s since it laid out the grittier side of the new wave of British heavy metal and brought a lot more dirt into metal as a whole, laying out a style of evil, thrashing motion, and grit that laid the groundwork for everyone from Metallica and Anthrax, to the Melvins, and of course... laying out the foundation for black metal. However, Venom were really far from black metal, more so establishing the rough production standards and obsession with Satan rather than the actual black metal sound. What we get on here is a lot like Mot\u00f6rhead, but nastier and more dedicated to an occult image. The music contained within is a series of catchy pieces of sleazy, crunching metal that snags you and swings you into the fire. There may be nastier and more evil bands nowadays, but there's no denying the strength of Welcome to Hell since it sill maintains a lot of its grimy crunch and signature songs to this day.\n\nWelcome to Hell was pretty much an excessive jump into the low-down outlaw image that metal had cultivated for itself in the 70s and early 80s. Sex, murder, and devil worship are the lyrical topics and they're paired with a very raw, bassy, distorted guitar sound and a gravel-throated vocalist with an \"I do as I want, piss off!\" kind of attitude that really sells the \"demonic outlaw\" persona established on here. The songs are often fast and crunchy, but also catchy in a way that almost makes you want to hum the lyrics out to yourself despite being fairly evil and nasty with their tone. It's almost insidious how songs like \"Welcome to Hell\" thrash about, songs like \"Poison\" swing about, or songs like \"One Thousand Days in Sodom\" march along while maintaining a catchy backbone beneath the rotten muscle of in-your-face riffing from Mantas. The whole thing is rowdy with a level of reckless abandon and grit that was uncommon at the time, mixing even more punk into the metal than obvious forebears like Mot\u00f6rhead. This was loaded with more scummy infernal grit rather than the biker-esque roughness of Mot\u00f6rhead. This hit lower and harder than before.\n\nThis is the kind of stuff that leaps onto you and knocks you around with a chaotic rhythm, a level of malice that was unusual for the time, and a level of sleaze that's still pretty intense even today. Every song is a headbanging frenzy with blunt riffing that's perfect for getting people's feet moving and bodies slamming into each other. The rhythm grips you and isn't afraid to punch and shove. Welcome to Hell is consistently dark, dirty, and ready to pounce with the sound being noticeably ugly and mean. It upped the ante on how filthy metal could be and stood out from most British metal bands in 1980 simply for their filth. Even today, the combination of grit, chaos, and catchiness make this a rumbling classic with iconic songs throughout its playing time. From the fast-paced, bar-brawling body-blows of \"Sons of Satan\" to the intoxicated swaying of \"In League With Satan\" and beyond, there's plenty of corrupting signature tunes on here. Yeah, the lyrics are obvious, goofy pseudo-satanism, but they make for a lot of memorable lines and quips snarled out by Cronos such as \"live like an angel die like a devil, got a place in hell reserved for me\" or any line from \"In League With Satan\". Welcome to Hell has the right balance of catch, kick, and pure scumminess to keep its strength and status throughout the years.\n\nWelcome to Hell makes Venom's intentions of delivering demonic sleaze to the masses very clear. This is a mean, rumbling piece of raw heavy metal with a passion for sin with catchy songwriting, insidious over-the-top lyrics, and buzzing crusty guitars with a strong low end and gnarled, mean riffs that use the nastiness of this album's production to its advantage to wrap all of this together into a rowdy infernal romp that gets its points across with each memorable song. It's also influential for getting a lot of metal bands on board with the idea of using punk-like gritty production to further accent their heaviness and menace. Every song leaves an impact and even though this isn't anywhere remotely near some massive opus, it's thoroughly enjoyable throughout without fail and with plenty of punkish demonic filth in each belting song.\n",
        "\nDear Cronos,\n\nI know that you have invented black metal, death metal and everything else between heaven and hell. That's one of the reasons why I am a Venom fan since I bought \"At War With Satan\" back in 1983 or 1984. I went with Venom through thick and thin. Cronos, you and me know that the history of the band has seen some lows and no, I don't speak of the albums with the Demolition Man. But I didn't care and I was finally rewarded by \"From the Very Depths\". A golden future seemed to be at hand. But now comes this EP... what can I say? It draws the shorter straw in each comparison. Let's put it in relation to...\n\n...\"Av\u00e9\", the album of your former companions Mantas and Abaddon. Their debut under the banner of Venom Inc. presents some lively and some well-hung riffs and many good compositions that have an infectious effect. By contrast, \"100 Miles to Hell\" sounds anything but spectacular. The title track with its solid guitar work doesn't suck, but its mid-tempo and the conventional pattern fail to give it a special glitter. To add insult to injury, lyrical lines like \"Lay Down Your Soul to Sell... 100 Miles to Hell\" appear as a self-parody. \n\n...\"From the Very Depths\", your last longplayer. The album had a lot of great tracks, but here we have rather cheap riffs and predictable configurations. Not to mention the fact that \"We the Loud\" annoys me, because its ending is much too long, repetitive and useless. Especially the moaning of your bass guitar gives the entire track an insubstantial touch. In view of such a pretty mediocre number, it is a cold comfort that the earthy production of \"100 Miles to Hell\" is more or less on a par with that of your formidable full-length from 2015.\n\n...the fantastic Venom EPs from the early eighties. Songs like \"Lady Lust\", \"Die Hard\", \"Seven Gates of Hell\" or \"Manitou\" were true monsters, classics that have stood the test of time. But a track like \"Beaten to a Pulp\" has - in spite of its acceptable instrumental part - absolutely nothing that could create a comparable reputation. Its unimaginative chorus illustrates the lack of outstanding ideas most significantly. Speaking of unimaginativeness, please compare the covers of \"100 Miles to Hell\" and, for example, \"Manitou\". The visual difference in terms of originality could not be bigger - and the same applies for the musical content.\n\nCronos, my old hero, you, your seemingly undernourished guitarist and the long-haired animal behind the drums will have my solidarity eternally, because the name Venom has become a monument. (And please forgive me that I support Venom Inc. as well.) You lead one of the bands that accompany me since more than three decades. But it is a critical solidarity and as much as I regret it: this EP does not whet the appetite for a new full-length. With a great deal of good will, one can say that the three tracks keep the head above water. But that's all. I admit that Venom have returned from the dead many times. Outputs like \"Prime Evil\", \"Cast in Stone\" or \"From the Very Depths\" come to my mind. Nevertheless, what goes around comes around. Therefore, Cronos, consult Satan, invent the next music style, search for demo recordings from the early eighties with some great, never released songs or do whatever you want. But don't record \"just another album\" when entering the studio next time - I am curious whether you are able to regain your former strength. I hope so.\n\nSincerely yours, Felix 1666\n",
        "\nThe Return.....\n\nThe two latest albums has set the bar high, but the group tries it\u00b4s best to fulfill the increased expectations. They reach a remarkable hit rate while delivering three excellent numbers. The band scores with a lovely EP just in time for (black) christmas.\n\nCronos shows once again that his voice has its own unique stamp. With the right portion of fury, his demonic approach is still absolutely convincing. Moreover, his vocal lines shape some sections of the EP in an impressive way. No question that Cronos has not forgotten how to spell the words \"Black\" and \"Metal\". The first track, \u201c100 Miles To Hell\u201d is a groovy midtempo classic Venom track with some familiar satanic lines in the lyrics. \n\nOn the B-side, the velocity is faster and the music combines some serious dirty thrash elements with gloomy parts, and they find the right balance between these ingredients and creates an atmosphere of confident. The Bulldozer bass of Cronos creates some magic in the latter part of \u201cWe The Loud\u201d who focuses on speed while demonstrating Venom\u00b4s joy of playing, and is one out of many highlights on this EP\u2019s 11 minute journey. All instrument has received great treatment from Cronos who produced the album as always. He knows how he will present Venom and has done a great job. The mighty drums from Dante emphasize this statement. \n\nThe furious \u201cBeaten To A Pulp\u201d attacks you with its intense and original guitar lines. The massive guitar chords is awesome and really haunting. Some of Rage's best work ever. Spellbinding tone he got on this one! \n\nThis EP shows that Venom continue to release quality metal after all these years\u2026a feat that some bands from the 80s just can not pull off. \u201c100 Miles To Hell\u201d is a must have EP and there\u2019s no sign of them slowing down. New chapters are on it\u00b4s way. They have returned!\n",
        "\nAs a Venom fan for the last 35-years, it pains me to think that the original trio that emerged from the hellish confines of Newcastle, England now sits woefully divided. As is the seeming norm these days, there are, indeed, two vehicles claiming the Venom moniker, one with Cronos and some hired guns and the other Venom Inc with the original Prime Evil lineup of Tony Dolan, Mantas and Abandon (the latter being far more interesting and musically viable). So, here I sit, as a longtime, long-suffering fanboy, engaging the newest EP from the Cronos camp called 100 Miles to Hell, which is about 101 miles too long.\n\nWhile Venom Inc has offered up a full-length more than worthy of the namesake, Cronos has been pumping out subpar, sterile mediocrity for the last decade-plus. While the Venom / Motorhead comparisons have always been more than a little justified in terms of raw energy and attention to content over style, Venom seems to be stuck in a rut by going through robotic, predictable motions. They seem bent on appeasing only the crazed fanboys and nostalgia-wrapped \u201clegions\u201d that would buy a CD filled with Cronos farting into an old tin coffee can (which, at this point, would be a vast detour from this lackadaisical norm). Some bands need to know when to stop, but when the gravy train is attracting the same radicalized minions, what else does one do to make a living?\n\nThe music here is...okay, I guess. Nothing special, nothing exciting, but that's the least of the worries herein. The lyrics to these songs are not interesting in the least, giving way to pedestrian middle-school assemblage by way of the title tracks Dylanesque offering of \u201cFollow the ancient track--/ let the devil wear black--\u201d. Folks, this is what is musically viewed as riding something into the proverbial ground. This is a man who is criminally out of ideas, has no intention of even trying anymore at this point and is more than comfortable just phoning in a sorry ass slab of music like this and slapping the Venom logo on it, a logo that used to mean something. It's apparent that Cronos is trying hard to recapitulate on past tracks, i.e., \u201cWe the Loud,\u201d a sad sequel to \u201cToo Loud for the Crowd,\u201d the latter being a crowd-pleasing track that got the blood flowing back in 1985. The title track for this EP is flat, lifeless and a literal \u201chit the bathroom\u201d song in every facet. Even as the EP closes with \u201cBeaten to a Pulp,\u201d my only thought is how Cronos used words like \u201cpathetic,\u201d \u201cdying,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d and \u201creeks of desperation\u201d and I can't help but wonder if his subconscious is somehow trying to relay a message to him...a message he won't ever hear.\n\nIs it the worst thing I've ever heard under the Venom name? I'd say it's no worse than Metal Black, From the Very Depths or Fallen Angels, but it's just boring and beating a dead horse in the middle of a muddy dirt road, and at this point either pump up the formula or just stop the madness. Becoming AC/DC and putting out the same formulaic album every couple of years when the bills are due worked for AC/DC, but for Venom it'll be a sardonic addition to their already weakened legacy. This is very typical of certain bands to figure that as long as the sales aren't horrible for their allotted position in the music world, then they can just churn out the same recycled lethargy and know the restless slaves will lap up the remnants like hungry lap dogs without question or complaint.\n\nFor my dollar, seek out the Venom Inc chasm and get a a taste of what it means to be a band with a defined legacy that can and does implement modern nuances and imaginative resources to keep the old formula fresh and exciting. Stop worrying about KVLT status for liking the \u201cimposters\u201d or \u201cscabs\u201d and let it sink in that one of the guys in Cronos' camp came from a Bon Jovi tribute band and Inc's Tony Dolan is from the mighty Atomkraft...I'll let that sink in for you.\n\nThere comes a time when you have to give up the ghost and go gently into that good night. It's a shame that more bands don't follow this advice.\n\n(Originally written for www.metalbite.com)\n",
        "\nFor the better part of 30-years the coveted Assault series by Venom has been some of the unholiest of grail records to try and complete. I know it personally took me 20 years to assemble all seven of the original records, a task that took me to the furthest reaches of the planet and saw me disseminate ungodly amounts of money to add them to my collection. Amazingly enough, I've come to find that a few of these releases were, indeed, bootleg editions never authorized by the Newcastle trio, but to a then-14-year old Le000000000000000gion this mattered very little.\n\nThese mini-LPs were all released over time between 1985 and 1988, and now all of these years later Dissonance Productions out of the U.K. has seen fit to reissue all of them in a nifty little box set for an equally nifty little price. The set contains all seven of the unholy collections: American Assault, Canadian Assault, French Assault, Japanese Assault, German Assault and Scandinavian Assault, most seeing CD release for the first time (save for Japanese Assault, which was released on the VAP label out of Japan on both CD and vinyl back in the late 80's).\n\nFor the absolute Venom enthusiast, of which there are countless numbers, this is a necessary hodge-podge of studio and live tracks, with the occasional interview thrown in for measure. While I had a feeling that the original sources for this set would be vinyl (and I was right) the charm and value of the set isn't diminished one iota. The box contains seven nice replica cardboard sleeves completely reminiscent of the old album covers; it really does appear that some care was put into the assemblage of the set, albeit devoid of a booklet or any additional info about the individual releases. In this case the content can, quite emphatically, stand all on its own. Upon their original releases, these were EPs that had both live tracks (some taken from the Alive in '85 or Live at Hammersmith videos respectively) and some rare singles and b-sides. If you are the aforementioned lifelong Venom Legion, these tracks and collections will be no surprise to you, but for newer and older arm's-length fans alike this set provides a wondrous trip back to a time when scouring the local record stores for these records was an all-consuming affair. My personal copy of Canadian Assault carries with it a tale of two best friends beating the hell out of each other in the record store over this evil slab of wax way back in 1985. This band had strange effects of some of us...yet I offer no apologies. Venom fans are notoriously sentimental when it comes to their personal collections, and these Assault records managed to elude some of us for years. I eventually found my Japanese Assault vinyl through the age-old \u201cguy that knows a guy that knows another guy\u201d and paid a hefty amount for it. The CD I procured some time after that was a little less of a challenge (a classified ad in the back of an old trade mag called Goldmine), but nevertheless it was exciting to add these coveted treasures to my library. Now the masses at hand can add all of these little Assault gems to their own personal arsenals in one fell swoop.\n\nSo, all of my personal reflections aside, is the set actually worth the price of admission? As a fan I say yes, it's a nice addition to the collection. Now, as a reviewer with my reputation on the line? I still offer a cautionary yes, the caution being that, again, the source material is from vinyl. For those of us that find a charm in those pops and clicks between tracks, this is nothing short of wanton nostalgia nipping at our elder heels, and it's a welcome look back. That said, there are some audiophiles out there that want nothing to do with a CD sourced from vinyl, and that's all well and good \u2013 it would serve you folks to heed this warning before purchasing the set.\n\nAll of this aside, yes, we have another collection of \u201chits\u201d from Venom to go along with the 100 other compilations lying around out there occupying space, but there is a real sense of treasure attached to this one if you're so inclined to accept such wonderful trivialities into your head. \n\n(Originally written for www.metalbite.com)\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026unveil the pentagram and feel the demon\u2019s lust\u2026\u201d\n\nThis promo video of two songs recorded live in September \u201982 that all together time in at less than seven minutes is abound with very little info about its existence. Well, since it\u2019s a promo and wasn\u2019t meant for the world theater, it\u2019s likely a limited run that was sent to here and there television stations. I\u2019ve never seen a copy, but its contents can be found elsewhere without having to hire Colombo.\n\nOne definite place always tolling twelve with this \u201cWitching Hour\u201d footage is the '85 Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge, which lifts this video\u2019s performance and replaces their appearance in that show (for whys and wherefores, see the review there). Furthermore, \u201cBloodlust\u201d does a double-take on the scarce Video Nightmare, also of \u201885. Didn\u2019t really feel like looking too hard for more, so\u2026. \n\nAs for its resident clips that are split only by a rendering of the Black Metal album cover shown through some sorta fire lens or something, they\u2019re visually at a spectacular level for a band with really little level to \u2018em in \u201982, considering their one album discography. I mean, Maiden and Sabbath coulda played on smaller stages and with less colored strobes, flood lights, explosives, smoke, fog, props, effects and a (now infamously well-known) deafening intro of schizoid chaos, announced from the very depths of hell which even has the slight chance of scaring the Hulk outta his purple shorts. The predominately yellow tinge from the lights colors Cronos and Mantas an additional fiery occult, the two guys on their feet who use \u2018em well to cover the large stage, with Mantas getting a running start to hip-check a stack of amps he doesn't seem care for, meanwhile Cronos thrashes on the ground with a bass he doesn't seem care for. And Abaddon\u2019s behind a drum kit he should care for, all forty or so components of it (it\u2019s rather large). These guys are showmen, Cronos especially; always coolly animated as he growls, rants and sneers into his down-pointing overhead mike Lemmy-style, involving the crowd where he can, taking himself and the act only so seriously. He has a tendency to punch Tom Araya in the eye with details entertained in another review.\n\nVenom\u2019s sonic presence is just as enthralling, especially when taking on two of their choicest concoctions, and three single word descriptions of the live sound are thick, vital and boisterous\u2026let\u2019s make it four: overflowing. Mantas rips into \u201cBloodlust\u201ds great opening solo like he kidnapped it right off the single. \n\nDull moments can\u2019t live where this good stuff calls home (that is, when it\u2019s not loaned out), a short n\u2019 sweet track list that\u2019s also easily found on YouTube.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026hear infernal legions plead as Satan sings his songs of war\u2026\u201d\n\nThrough a two-song massacre equal in thrashing chaos and contemptuously-wrought malevolence, the still new UK trio known as Venom reinforce their recently-usurped station as Satanic masters of the universe, yet still only a sliver of the diminutive metal community even know they exist, let alone the world. Their loss. \n\nThose lucky enough to have found their ears wrapped like leathery wings around the band\u2019s beautifully-titled debut, \u201881\u2019s Welcome to Hell, may have felt the violent quaking of the landscape under their feet where metal was still a work in progress, a kid just learning to tie its shoes. It wasn\u2019t for everyone, that\u2019s for sure, but for many this soundtrack to devildom, with its depraved (lack of) production, inside out and roughshod songcraft, and absence of 99% moral fabric, was the progress at least part of the style - the barbaric part - had been working toward, torn shoelaces and who cares? \n\nOthers hated and feared it like the end of the world. Good.\n\nWith a bassist\u2019s growled command, the battle that is \u201cBloodlust\u201d pummels the field with perfectly chaotic percussion while mowing down stragglers with one of Mantas\u2019 coolest rip-roaring solos. In addition to a thick and tumultuous central rhythm, lyrics are mercilessly delivered, breathless without faltering, and are slathered in coagulating blood drained by Count Cronos, Vampire Supreme. It\u2019s one of their legion tales desirable enough to require a throne in Hell alongside \u201cWitching Hour\u201d, \u201cIn League With Satan\u201d and, coincidentally, a flip-side song in no rush to get there. \n\nMenacing \u201cIn Nomine Satanas\u201d slow churns the b-side with thunderous diabolic calm, its bludgeoningly meticulous evil comparably unorthodox as Cronos, master of the wickedly-arresting, grim-souled vocal approach that was as good as unheard of at this time, explodes with a barrage of cruel decrees that\u2019d have any abyssal lord in earshot seeking to recruit the guy. Bass gurgles a backdrop to the alien shrieks of a disembodied solo. Strange, inverted power chords invite streams of anguished cries to further blacken this ghost story\u2019s dramatic end. Venom's slowest, most methodical cut thus far has evidently been sliced from the best of corpses. \n\n\"In the name of Satan\"...neither of these will ever appear on a full-lengther without bonus track status. Don't know why, and Cronos laughs as we all cry, but they'll escape this imprisonment and be available in all kinds of places some day along the way. \n\nNow, dislike or hatred for this single simply means you don\u2019t like Venom and, considering the quality of its songs, never will. Disappointment with this single simply means you\u2019re stupid. \n\nGot the purple vinyl pressing, do ya? Behold the dead wax run-outs for signs of evil.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026if you like metal, the heaviest it gets, I wanna hear you fuckin\u2019 scream\u2026\u201d \u2013 Baloff \n\nA Saturday Night Fever theater poster slowly and steadily burns away, possibly set aflame by excessive Jack Daniels fumes seeping from Paul Baloff\u2019s harsh, anti-operatic throatsear while he questions and incites an audience that\u2019s, um, extremely unusual for this joint. Travolta and his now extremely off-white/burnt umber suit smolders to reveal a still shot of Kerry King and that titanic goddamn armband of his. With each of the Exodus frontman\u2019s screams appears a band name in imperial purple that to the world at large has nothing to do with royalty. Royalty, however, is exactly what these bands become, at least in the blackened eyes of the underground metal realm. \n\nManhattan\u2019s Studio 54 - its owners, managers, bartenders, servers, bouncers, dishwashers, coat checkers and regulars \u2013 had to wonder during the show\u2019s throes and no doubt in its aftermath about the thought processes which allowed this horde of heavy metal fans through the doors to terrorize their renowned \u201870s discoth\u00e8que-turned-\u201980s celebrity nightclub. They also realized, quite painfully, this wasn\u2019t ordinary heavy metal as it was widely known, and naturally neither was this mob. This wasn\u2019t Kiss in \u201982, nor was it a thri-way celebration of Ratt invading your privacy, the midnite dynamite of Kix, or how Whitesnake effortlessly slid it in. Not only did the acts of this fateful Wednesday night offer no identities to those outside underground metal\u2019s pentagram-pierced circle, the style(s) of metal championed by band and fan alike was the moon to all but a handful of the world\u2019s inhabitants. \n\nApparently, a disco glitter ball still hung from the ceiling. \n\n\u201c\u2026you guys are fucking awesome\u2026\u201d - Baloff\n\nSomewhere between Eighth Avenue and Broadway on West 54th Street, for probably the first time ever a crowd - largely denim n\u2019 leather-clad elder teenagers to, at most, mid-twenties leather n\u2019 denim-clad adults - congregates on this lovely spring evening as if to attend an ecological symposium, only they\u2019re bent on its destruction rather than preservation. During these still fairly formative years of heavy metal, as well as the even younger toddler days of lesser known, yet more aggressive thrash metal, with t-shirts and patches swearing fealty to Raven, Venom, Slayer, Voivod, and W.A.S.P., this small throng of rogue misfits yelling, hollering and headbangin\u2019 street-side is the epitome of the unapologetic, true-blue, original underground metal masses that knew no bandwagon for any of this crazy shit, and at this date every bent note played during the show was indeed crazy shit. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is on this April night - with the exception of the purposely-zoomed-in-on homeless black guy in the green skullcap who I can only imagine stumbled into this 99% white mess that's going ballistic about something he has zero interest in, but since it's possibly the most exciting thing that's happened to him since the other day when he found that half-full can of lima beans on the side of the road, he decides to make the best of the situation and, well, 'when in Rome', I guess - every single person out there showed up not only to see their band up there playing, but just as much wanted their band to witness them out there raging for them. Fracture this crowd into a gathering of solitary fans and their becomes his/her band, a single relationship that with favoritism often develops into a private bond. For many underground metal fans like these, many of whom were loners directly because of this unorthodox music and the so few people drawn to it, the scene itself evolved into a home for all such bonds, like a haven for best kept secrets, and because these aren\u2019t public bonds that one shares openly and to just anyone, they become lonesome, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for the scene to act as building blocks for comradery between strangers who together are both surprised and intrigued to see another person flashing a Manowar or Voivod pin, or are caught marveling at one another\u2019s captivatingly-obscure Tank and Virgin Steele shirts. That\u2019s not to say no one got socked in the eye that night, but I digress. \n\n\u201c\u2026they say the pen is mightier than the sword. I say fuck the pen, \u2018cos you can die by the sword\u2026\u201d - Araya\n\nThe video\u2019s set list, in its unchronological wisdom, is put to exceptional use, initially exposing its knowingly-limited audience to the bands one song at a time and naturally begins with opening act Exodus and with a yarn that introduces \u201cPiranha\u201d which has gradually found comedic infamy over the years, and ends with a cool psychedelically-traumatized solo by Gary Holt, who stands facing his amps in an ending still-shot with picking arm triumphantly raised, then fades into an eruption of Slayer and \u201cDie by the Sword\u201d, which abruptly and awesomely disgorges into existence moments before Slayer's German-helmeted Slatanic Wehrmacht motto marches across the screen. Venom\u2019s sets are a story unto itself, and part of that romantic tale uncovers why the original footage of their leg of this show has never been unearthed. \n\n\u201c\u2026can we say fuck?\u201d \u2013 Cronos\n\nTwo of the three, Venom and Slayer, honor us with interviews, with the former\u2019s nearly eight minute conversation wisely split in two sections. Despite its length and for simple reasons, it\u2019s the more coherent one. With known quiet guy Mantas absent, in the presence of talkative, animated, friendly, funny and good-natured Cronos and Abaddon, the chat rolls by briskly while they fight over a whisky bottle. Fact is Venom didn\u2019t take themselves very seriously despite their anti-Christian reputation and props that went with it. Neither apparently did members of Slayer, who clown around just as much except with four voices instead of two (with Lombardo doing most of the talking when he's not catching flying lunch meat in his mouth) and some endearingly ham-handed editing that cuts it all out of proportion. Regardless, the \u2018views are spread out quite evenly over the video\u2019s course and shouldn\u2019t feel the wrath of the fast-forward button. \n\n\u201c\u2026New York, you\u2019re makin\u2019 California look like shit\u2026\u201d \u2013 Baloff\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the venue itself is small or just the performing area, but as with most space-hindered places the majority of fat bass identity constricts in favor of the mid-range and its treble, but that doesn\u2019t mean the sound is bad. On the contrary, these higher-ranged sonics seem to infuse the music with some slightly greater urgency and possibly even crisps it up a bit. As a whole, I\u2019ve never been dissatisfied with it. \n\n\u201c\u2026alright, this next song, it\u2019s another fast one, but aren\u2019t they all?\u201d - Holt\n\nNow for what's beyond lunch meat. Exodus is first up with \u201cMetal Command\u201d, \u201cExodus\u201d and \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d. The five-piece\u2019s ferocity seems to grow with each song; for any band that\u2019s a vital gift, but for this act it\u2019s only as long as the heavily-reverbed Baloff can keep up, and when his mike isn\u2019t failing, the big lug often lags behind. The other guys know they\u2019re killing it, verified by the twin H\u2019s during a moment of victorious affection* (just as Baloff falters again), meanwhile powerhouse Tom Hunting pounds his ass off during one of their greatest songs, \"Strike of the Beast\". While Bonded by Blood wasn\u2019t even on shelves yet, by the end of their set there\u2019s little doubt unknown Exodus had won over lotsa future metal-clad consumers on the opposite coast. \n\n\u201c\u2026let me hear ya say this one, ahh\u2026\u201d - Araya \n\nEvery thrash band bends a knee to Slayer, as do their fans, the legions of them. While \u201884\u2019s Live Undead is their first official live recording, this is their first official video recording that in my personal history doubles as the initial jaw-dropping time I saw them in action, which was quite awhile before Reign in Blood soaked the planet. Saying the experience merely laid me out is like dismissing a battleship as just a boat, and all of the live video coverage filmed over the years had to compete with (and lose to) how this fiery foursome ravaged every soul in sight on this particular night. \n\nSlayer perform on the razor\u2019s edge of haywire; it\u2019s as if their innate violence overflow valve ruptured and began spewing some new strain of hostility directly into their bloodstream right before the show. Araya\u2019s lungs are diabolic in their disdainful lyrical discharge and are unnervingly forceful while sending several maniacal \u201cAntichrist\u201d screams heavenward. One can actually hear a miniature sonic boom caused by an exploding sound barrier during \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d following the chorus\u2019 refrain and breakdown**. With less than a month\u2019s time in stores, Hell Awaits, their second full-lengther, could only reap the rewards from this show. Slo-moes, purple-ized freeze frames, wavering fire lenses, a skank\u2019s left tit, Tom\u2019s midnight-black mop, a lyric screw-up in \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, Lombardo\u2019s pounding drumwork backdropped by a sweat rag D.R.I. shirt\u2026all these years later I still can\u2019t escape the original chills their set gave me. \n\n\u201c\u2026where the hell am I?\u201d - Cronos\n\nIt\u2019s with the emergence of Venom\u2019s headliner set where things get infamously dubious. Instantly obvious is the bigger stage\u2026the much bigger stage, to fit the dozens of stacked amps no one else had, and extravagance, with way more floodlights flooding this, yes, extravagantly much bigger stage with more psychedelic colors than my imagination had already clothed Holt\u2019s guitar solo in. The sound is polished and voluminous, like a concert hall recording. Well that\u2019s \u2018cos Venom\u2019s portion of the show is replaced with admittedly bewitching concert footage of dramatically tolled-in \u201cWitching Hour\u201d from their \u201982 Live E.P. video, where Mantas body checks amp towers and Cronos tantrums on the floor while the song collapses unto itself around them. It gets better, \u2018cos also clear is that their second and last contribution, \u201cCountess Bathory\u201d, has comparably dissimilar atmosphere, sound and props to \u201cWitching Hour\u201d and the rest of the video. That\u2019s \u2018cos it\u2019s been abducted from \u201884\u2019s The 7th Date of Hell \u2013 Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, another official Venom video, which means the only actual Venom footage from this night captured for this video is the interview. Regardless, story-driven \u201cCountess Bathory\u201d, considered a fan-fave, explodes with pyrotechnical flair before Cronos decimates a ladybug with the moxy to crawl across the stage during their set with his bass. This is after all the type of destructive, chaotic behavior fans of the Newcastle trio know to expect and expect to love. \n\n\u201c\u2026we were in the crowd\u2026no we weren\u2019t, we were on stage, there was people in the crowd. It\u2019s the drugs, Doug\u2026\u201d \u2013 Cronos\n\nIn reality, however, Mantas remained in England sick with chickenpox. Two of his countrymates were drafted in his place, Fist\u2019s Dave Irwin and Avenger\u2019s Les Cheetham, with each learning half of the set list. This factoid means virtually nothing when speaking of this particular show though, \u2018cos while Venom did play that night, their sets weren\u2019t recorded. It seems the agreement to pay the band prior to recording went south, a direction that was soon followed by the video team\u2019s production cables, which mysteriously fell victim to a Venom-wielded fire axe before the headliner took the stage. To make things right, Neat Records compensated the video company with these pre-recorded clips. \n\nAfter the \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d milieu during the closing credits (fairly prophetic now, for even Studio 54's disco-licking boundary proved ineffective in suppressing Slayer's brand of evil), a gravel-voiced drill sergeant of the Combat army calling himself Major Mayhem promotes some of the label\u2019s available recordings, and even this is kinda sideways cool. \n\nWith adequate camerawork, a coherently chaotic sound and sometimes interestingly distracted, almost free-form style of editing which is perfect for this music\u2019s imperfect primal force, The Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge is, well, simply a great video, even deficit headliner stage footage, and the assorted crowd shots (needed more, especially during band sets) make people either laugh or cry. Sure, it would\u2019ve been nifty to see Venom in the same context as their openers, but what are ya gonna do? \n\nSomehow this video has eluded every bounty hunter dedicated to DVD transference and remains a VHS fossil. Also puzzling is how this hasn\u2019t been reviewed for this site until now. More puzzling is why it\u2019s taken me like twelve years to get to it. \n\n\u201c\u2026we love ya\u2026we\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d \u2013 Baloff \n\u201c\u2026lemme hear ya!\" - Araya\n\u201c\u2026die hard!\u201d \u2013 Cronos \n\nFun fact #ky0i5\u2019: during one of the dates, Tom Araya drunkenly boards Venom\u2019s tour bus and decides Cronos\u2019 hair is a nifty place to take a whiz. Cronos socks him in the eye, sober hands shake the next day, and is the reason the Slayer bassist has a bit of a black eye in the video. From Dave Lombardo\u2019s mouth to my ear. \n\nFun fact F: Venom is one of the few bands to have headlined shows over both Metallica and Slayer (and possibly the other half of the Big 4). A friend of mine has/had this poster when we were in high school. I told him never to get rid of it. Wonder if he listened. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/251146116700159250.\n\n* (30:04 - paragraph eight)\n** (44:22 - paragraph ten)\n",
        "\nIt seems that more often than not, \"Welcome to Hell\" or \"Black Metal\" are described as the best Venom albums. They are no doubt influential and essential albums that paved the way for the genres of thrash and black metal, with the album \"Black Metal\" coining the name for the genre itself. It may not really MUSICALLY be black metal, but the lyrical aesthetics were certainly there. \"At War with Satan\", Venom's third album, is certainly an ambitious one. Venom was never really known for technical prowess but with this album, they took a huge leap ahead in songwriting and musical ideas.\n\nThe album is opened up with the title track. This song is almost 20 minutes long. This is a HUGE risk considering the band's previous emphasis on simplicity. Granted there are plenty of bands within certain genres of simple music that can drone out repetition for long songs and make them sound great, but Venom doesn't really fit in this category. I believe the band's longest song before this was \"Red Light Fever\" from \"Welcome to Hell\", and it was only slightly over 5 minutes in length. So, yes, this was something of a totally new concept for this band. And they managed to pull it off wonderfully. This song is perhaps the best the band has ever produced and pretty much makes up half of the album. There is a wide variety of riffs, ranging from doom riffs to fast, thrashy, punky riffs. The riffs don't sound too technical, no surprise there, but there are a lot of varying riffs that keep the song interesting. The clean acoustic segment shortly after the 13-minute mark is hauntingly beautiful and contrasts nicely from the aggressive riffs that tend to make up most of the song. Even through simplicity, this shows how Venom was able to still write really good songs through their earlier years, despite limitations. \n\nSo, the title track is the best song Venom has ever managed to write and really makes the album that much better, but are the other songs bad? No, not at all. \"Rip Ride\" is a classic Venom number that takes us back to the first two albums. Most of this stuff just sounds like a band having fun playing together. \"Women, Leather and Hell\" makes for a fun-paced party metal song. Well, sort of. It's not PARTY music obviously but it's certainly loads of evil fun. Speaking of fun, what is up with the last track? This was obviously recorded as a joke but it's fairly humorous. With a title of \"Aaaaaaarrghh\", you really wouldn't expect anything else. It's nice to see bands have humor. It's not really a song but rather just some drumming, random guitar stuff, and some screaming and yelling of obscenities and random stuff. It's stupid and unnecessary but still manages to be funny.\n\nThe production this time around is quite a step up from the previous two albums. Really, the only reason I keep comparing \"At War with Satan\" to \"Welcome to Hell\" and \"Black Metal\" is because I consider this trilogy of albums to be Venom's classic period of essential releases. Anything else, for me, is generally a hit or miss. Out of their current discography of 14 full-length albums, I tend to only really enjoy half. So, maybe around 6 or 7 albums, if that. But I digress. The production here is fairly clean but not polished to the point of the album losing its organic sound. The bass is turned up nicely in the mix and we can clearly hear it throughout. It gives the music a more meaty sound, combined with the guitars which are louder this time around, and the pummeling drums. If I had any complaint about the production, though, it would be that the drums are slightly too high in the mix. They aren't offending, though, so really, it doesn't take away from the music. The drums, like everything else, are simple in nature and suit the music well. \n\nThis is surely my favorite Venom album it holds up to the first two extremely well in my book. Its strong yet simple songwriting and boastful production really put it ahead of its predecessors and to date, Venom has not been able to top this album with following releases. Really, they haven't come close.\n",
        "\nFor this review, I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re not new to metal and already know why this album is important. If you're not, you can find out on some of the other reviews here but I\u2019m going to cut to the chase. This landmark release is about as influential as they come in the metal world and, as such, it's been praised to Heaven, err... Hell and back and, while this was a trailblazing effort, it\u2019s not quite perfect. There are a few small problems that pop up too often and drag this album down from what otherwise might have been a perfect score. \n\nA number of indisputable classics call this album home. The title track is a powerhouse opener. When the welding torch or whatever industrial machine that is at the beginning gives way to the main riff, you know you\u2019re in for an ass-whooping. The sloppy proto-thrash riffs barrel forth at a sickening speed, flattening you with ease. \u2018Heaven\u2019s on Fire\u2019 and \u2018Raise the Dead\u2019 are equally vital, with a boundless energy and merciless drive, both as stimulating as they come. Death, black, and thrash metal were all foreseen on this album and it\u2019s not hard to see why legions of followers from Metallica to Mayhem found Venom\u2019s twisted musical vision so inspiring. \n\nOn all of these songs, Black Metal's main selling points are on full display. First up is the record's simplicity and violent musicianship. No frills, no pretensions, just a vicious barrage of savage riffing and hostile attitude, demonstrating more than a little influence from the punk movement that had exploded into the public's awareness a few years prior. Said hostile attitude is there in the blazing guitar work, it's there in the drums that bash away with reckless fury, and it's there in Cronos' bellowing, his vocal tone not dissimilar to the sound of gravel scraping against sandpaper. And of course, the album's low-grade production is equally important, as Black Metal's desired roughness would be incomplete without it. If Mot\u00f6rhead can be said to have hot-rodded the metal genre, Venom supercharged it even further, equipping that vicious bitch with the engine of a drag racer and a dangerous amount of nitrous.\n\nSadly, this album isn't all sun-consuming darkness and Satanic mischief. About half of these tracks have endings that the songwriters clearly put almost no thought into. 'Teacher\u2019s Pet' is a prominent victim, with the band coming across like they didn\u2019t have time to think up a solid way to bring the song to a close so they just improvised this moment where the last note played on the guitar lingers and Cronos shouts \u201cThat was good. That was real good.\u201d More than half the pieces on the album also putter out like a junky old car with surprisingly weak, half-hearted endings.\n\n'Teacher's Pet' is the only real weak link here, a fine song hampered by the stupid crap that weighs it down. In addition to the half-baked ending, there's a needlessly long passage in the middle packed with awful noodling that goes nowhere. Eventually it comes to an end when a bunch of rowdy British youths start howling and singing about the teacher showing her tits, each of them managing to find a different way to be off-key. The rest of 'Teacher's Pet' is great, delivering the same savage, high-speed musical bruising most of the other songs do, but about a quarter of the song is just noise the band should have known nobody would want to hear. \n\nAs primitive as it may sound today, Black Metal was about as futuristic as they come. In a way, it predicted and laid the groundwork for a smorgasbord of genres, including speed, thrash, and black metal. Despite decades of those genres' practitioners building on the groundwork Venom provided, the ferocity and vitality of this album has rarely been surpassed or equaled. Even when the band slows down the tempo on the dread-inducing 'Buried Alive', Venom's strength as composers shines through, as they deliver an over-the-top cavalcade of songs as goofy as they are furious. This landmark release is absolutely essential, both for its place in history and the quality demonstrated through almost every moment of the disc.\n",
        "\nScientific fact: Venom are the single most important band to come out of the NWOBHM. Now, of course scientific facts need backup, and the backup is this single. Whereas other bands in the NWOBHM were prissy and clean (mostly), Venom were simplistic and primal, not bothering with elements like production or even execution, focusing on driving home the feeling and atmosphere. They were the biggest rejects in a scene of rejects, and this empowered them to do what they wanted, and really push boundaries.\n\nYou see, other bands who flirted with the Devil handled their approach with hazmat suits and lead-lined gloves, whereas Venom came straight out and thrust Satan and pentagrams and devilish imagery right in your face, and in doing so created about half of the metal scene we know today, so they may be the most important band in all of metal, even. But where does this tie into this single?, you ask.\n\nBecause this is the point where metal began its obsession with the occult. Cite Black Sabbath if you desire, but they didn't spawn a single truly Satanic band (I say truly Satanic, but I mean bands whose lyrics directly allude to being truly Satanic). Venom created so many more. And it's thanks to Side A of this single.\n\n\"In League with Satan\" is a masterpiece of buildup, tension-and-release and claustrophobic, chilling atmosphere. Imagine: you are a listener in the early 80s, and you bought this single because of the striking cover art. You put the record on, expecting something like Diamond Head at the heaviest. There is some odd drumming, then a buzzsaw masquerading as a guitar kicks in. Then that voice comes in. THAT voice. Cronos's vocal, the voice of a thousand nightmares, smashes you over the head with its chilling narration of his evil deeds. You want to flee, but the military marching drumbeat freezes you and the infinitely dark and brilliant chorus pulls you even further in:\n\nEVIL!\nIN LEAGUE WITH SATAN!\n\nTwo simple lines which launched thousands of copycat bands. Mega-praise to Jeff 'Mantas' Dunn who uses his guitar as an atmospheric tool rather than an instrument. So, he was never John Petrucci. Yet another thing that would hinder most bands, but Venom were unfazed.\n\nDespite Side A being goddamn perfect, the reverse is flawed. \"Live like an Angel...\" has its good moments, but it has its crappy ones. Most notably the amazing chorus but poor verses and a riff of no stature. Critically, however, the feeling is still there, and elements are all in place so I can't raise all that many complaints. At least the band didn't put a love ballad or a tongue-in-cheek song as the B-Side to one of the most evil, atmospheric pieces ever recorded by mankind. It's that evil.\n\nIn conclusion, my telling you to put yourself in the shoes of an 80s listener demonstrates two things: 1) how revolutionary this was at the time of its release, being about the heaviest thing ever put to tape, and 2) the atmosphere. I know I've mentioned it so many times but that genuinely is the most important thing about this song. It really has to be listened to to be comprehended. If ever there was a hall of fame for most influential metal songs, this would get my vote.\n",
        "\nVenom\u2019s \u201cBlack Metal.\u201d Arguably one of the top 10 most influential heavy metal albums ever recorded. The spring from which thrash, death, and black metal all emerged. And I\u2019ve never heard it before this week. \n\nOK, yeah, that\u2019s a bit of heavy metal heresy, but I\u2019m not trying to impress you jerks. The issue isn\u2019t \u201chow influential is this album?\u201d THAT answer is: fucking very. I\u2019m not about to judge the album by how many other bands and genres sprung from its loins. So much hay has been made over that issue at this point that it\u2019s not really a relevant question anymore. It\u2019s been 34 years since it was recorded. My question here is \u201cis \u2018Black Metal\u2019 even any good?\u201d\n\nFirst off, I\u2019ll admit this album is hard to review after already hearing about fifty million other bands that took the ideas here and ran with and improved on, but I\u2019ll try.\n\nSecondly, this album occasionally gets categorized as thrash metal, or black metal or whatever the fuck. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s solidly a NWOBHM album. It\u2019s a mid-tempo rocker. There are definitely Judas Priest influences here, and there are a few songs with some obvious residual blues influences from early heavy metal (refer your sexy selves to the solo at 2:37 in \u201cBuried Alive\u201d and the main riff of \u201cRaise the Dead\u201d and \u201cSacrifice\u201d). It may have influenced thrash, but lumping Black Metal\u2019s square peg into thrash metal\u2019s square hole doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nThirdly, and most importantly, this album is still pretty fucking enjoyable. I was legitimately worried about that, but no. It\u2019s a good solid metal album, even if it might border a little closer at times to rock and roll by today\u2019s standards. The production is pretty much a smelly glob of doo, but I actually really like the garage rock sound because it makes the music sound a lot more authentic. The kind of live-feel this album has is where it really makes its bones.\n\nFourth, the subject matter of the lyrics is pretty generic. Satan, witchcraft, and the macabre have been staples of heavy metal music literally since the first fucking song of the first fucking heavy metal album ever made (Black Sabbath. I\u2019m talking about Black Sabbath.). \n\nGeneric as it is, there are a lot of moments (they\u2019re not all dingers) on \u201cBlack Metal\u201d where Venom makes this kind of subject matter seem so much more genuine than a lot of the other dickheads who\u2019ve driven Satan\u2019s good name through the mud over the last few decades. For instance \u201cBuried Alive\u201d has some of the legitimately spookiest lyrics I\u2019ve ever heard. And screaming \u201cI don\u2019t want to be born\u201d over and over in \u201cLeave Me In Hell\u201d is fairly horrifying. In short, \u201cBlack Metal,\u201d a 34-year old album I\u2019m listening to for the first time at the ripe old age of nearly 29, made Hell seem relevant, which is no small feat in heavy metal. \n\nThis is an album that warrants repeated listens even so many years later, but I gotta knock this album down a few points for helping draw up the blueprint for the most lyrically monolithic genre in all of music. Sorry, every black metal band ever, but you fuckers are lyrical one trick ponies and I blame Venom.\n",
        "\nThe twenty-first century has not been kind to extreme metal pioneers Venom. Four releases into their reunion and they have struggled to hit the proverbial nail on the head. As such, it was difficult to expect much on the new album, From The Very Depths. Yet somehow, Cronos and friends have managed to reverse this trend and come out with an album that despite its overall generic sound is still quite enjoyable. \n\nSure this isn't going to revolutionise heavy metal like Welcome To Hell and Black Metal did all those decades ago. It isn't even going to be remembered as a great example of their craft. But then neither are most of the albums being released in speed and thrash metal these days.\n\nUnlike the last few previous albums that were generally mid-tempo affairs flavoured by flawed attempts at modernity, From The Very Depths looks very much to their past for inspiration. And by past, we're talking their more late 1980s/early 1990s thrashy albums than the punky speed metal of their first three albums. \n\nThis is first and foremost an album of chuggy thrash riffs backed up by Cronos' distinctive bark and massive bass sound. And whilst there is no denying they are generic as hell, they are enjoyable due to their catchiness and classic sound. There is less variety than on previous affairs but that is a good thing given how hit and miss some of that variety was. Instead, where variety is used it is generally to good effect like the huge sounding \"Evil Law,\" complete with Slayer-esque guitar hooks or brooding (by Venom standards) \"Smoke.\" \n\nAnd unlike the previous albums, the band doesn't sound forced. Indeed it sounds more like someone's lit a fire under them and are determined to show the world that there is more to them than a smattering of pioneering albums released thirty years ago. \n\nThe album does suffer from the usual Venom indulgence of being too long. And this is where that lack of variety bites with a number of the faster songs blurring into one another. At other times they get too hung up on a cool riff and overplay it. \n\nDespite its flaws, From The Very Depths is a welcome addition for us Venom fans who were starting to wonder whether there was any life left in the old warhorse. It's a revitalisation of the band and hopefully a sign of better things to come.\n",
        "\n\"Nightmare\" made one thing very clear: the once glorious Venom had to face a serious crisis. The band was still mourning its loss of juvenile energy while any form of maturity was a long time coming. In search of a stylistic redirection, the band failed to have a clear objection in mind.\n\nThe title track naturally stands in the focus of this release. An almost dominant bass guitar leaves its mark. It is the only noteworthy feature of the more or less stable yet slightly awkward production while the composition itself follows the conventional song pattern. After a brief acoustic intro, Venom prefer a fairly boring mid-tempo rhythm that avoids any kind of unexpected breaks. Both verse and bridge are driven by the relatively nested riffing, but the one word chorus as well as the instrumental mid part do not persuade me. Venom want to create a haunting atmosphere, but they are only partially successful. In accordance with the completely shitty original artwork, some female screams bring this average number to an end. (To withdraw this cover was anything else but a bad idea.)\n\nThe B side shocks with stupidity, in particular with regard to the second exclusive track called \"F.O.A.D.\". This piece is fittingly titled, because the nonsensical sound collage presents itself as an affront to everybody who purchased this output. Similar to \"Aaaaaaarrghh\", this crappy stuff is no song in the narrower sense. But in view of the fantastic tracks of \"At War with Satan\", \"Aaaaaaarrghh\" appeared as the black sheep of the family without causing serious damage. Compared with this, \"F.O.A.D.\" is in a miserable situation, because it marks the low point of a mediocre record. Accordingly there are no tracks on \"Nightmare\" that make the listener forget this letdown. The live recording of the well-known \"Warhead\" does not make things any better. It just proves that Abaddon is not able to keep the (simple) rhythm. The comparatively aggressive \"Satanachist\" is already known, too. In the context of the here presented four songs, it deserves the place at the top of the table. But on albums like \"Black Metal\" or \"At War with Satan\", this composition would have been in danger to be classified as the flop of the full-length.\n\nWhat else do you need to know? Nothing, because \"Nightmare\" just cannot compete with the previous EPs of the chaotic horde. Even outtakes such as \"Senile Decay\" would have enriched this vinyl.\n",
        "\nTo avoid misunderstandings right from the beginning: this album does not offer prophecies of the great beast called Venom. No doubt, once they have appeared as prophets of a new metal style. But times have passed. Now this header just stands for a nice line of the lyrics of the title track. What is even worse, but this is anything else but a new finding, the British trio cannot be any longer described as the great beast. The two previous outputs, \"Hell\" as well as \"Metal Black\", did not score with beastly tracks. On the contrary, these flabby records had put the band in another light. The group appeared as a toothless and grotesque creature, deformed and socially ostracized. I thought that Venom would have been well advised to commit suicide, of course, not the members, only the band itself.\n\nBut Cronos obviously saw no reason to share my fatalistic point of view or he just had no idea what to do instead of marching on with Venom. Well, these options are not mutually exclusive. However, I must admit that his continued commitment was better than killing the band. \"Fallen Angels\" was a small step in the right direction. \n\nOf course, the excessive barbarism of their first nefarious records of the eighties does not re-emerge. Nonetheless, Venom have regained their currishness, at least to a certain extent. The band presents a relatively crude mix of heavy, power and thrash metal while black metal is of minor relevance. The predominantly crooked harmonies of the aforementioned predecessors of \"Fallen Angels\" have been almost completely banished. Instead, Cronos and his band mates have written some more or less coherent tunes that combine the generally hostile approach of the band with solid riffs and leads. There is no need to get ecstatic, but the album shows that Venom\u00b4s fire is still blazing. That alone gives me a good feeling.\n\nA shy drum kit welcomes the audience at the beginning of the opener. It whispers a soft \"Hello\" instead of knocking the listener down. Despite of this powerless start, the mid-tempo \"Hammerhead\" develops surprisingly well. It glitters with a smooth bridge and an effective chorus. Further solidly constructed tracks follow. No doubt, Venom did not aim to break speed records while creating the full-length. Additionally, they still sound skew sometimes. While listening to this record, you have to endure a certain number of very strange breaks (\"Nemesis\" and \"Lap of the Gods\") and the vocals of Cronos do not score in all aspects. There are also a few throwaway tracks, but in general, Venom deliver a serious and autochthonous work. Too bad that the album seems to be recorded by a drunken poltergeist. The rumbling sound can be understood as a tribute to their chaotic early days, but I would have preferred a more powerful production. Well, the recordings do not sound amateurish. Inter alia because of the omnipresent bass guitar, the mix of \"Fallen Angels\" has its specific charm. Nevertheless, it lacks of sharpness and penetrating power. It hails the attitude of the old school while appearing lackadaisical at the same time.\n\nWith regard to the lyrics, the three-piece is heading for absolutely new and previously undiscovered shores. Just read some lines of the seventh track: \"All hail Satanas... Lucifer / Evil One... All hail Satanas \u2013 Diabolus... Baphomet / Diabolus... Hail Satan\". Great poetry, I have never heard them singing about these satanic topics before! However, sarcasm is a nice thing, but who expected any other kind of lyrics? Just as a friendly reminder, we are talking about Venom. And I admit that I like this band, although \"Fallen Angels\" shows only a slight upward trend. It fails to deliver earworms, but it constitutes an honest effort. Lend an ear to songs like \"Damnation of Souls\" or \"Valley of the Kings\" and convince yourself.\n",
        "\nThere existed a lot of reasons why I appreciated Venom at the early stage of their career. Their image, the song titles, the design of \"At War with Satan\", even the squiggly \"V\" of the band logo, all these details contributed to the coherent overall picture. The most individual cause for my affinity to the British three-piece was the fact that they had such an amazing number of extremely good non-album tracks. The furious \"Lady Lust\" or the extraordinary \"Manitou\" with its mystical atmosphere, the straight \"Die Hard\" or the sinister \"The 7 Gates of Hell\" must be mentioned in this context. \n\n\"In Nomine Satanas\" joined this elitist circle. Its turbid guitar line, the bubbling bass and the slow-moving drums generated an evil atmosphere which was very similar to that of \"In League with Satan\". Cronos contributed a demonic laughter at the beginning and an endless series of spoken buzzwords at the end (\"infernal legions / Satan / war / mortal corpses / whore / destroy the priests...\"). Apart from that, everything was as always. In other respects, his vocal performance was solid and offered an enjoyable quantum of infamy. Maybe this number gets the award for the best hidden treasure of the hardly manageable back catalogue of Venom. I do not want to exclude that it took just a few minutes to write this song. But despite its simple formula, it developed a long lasting effect. It was furthermore a matter of course that the well-known \"Bloodlust\" did not need to hide behind its own B side. It possessed the power of an express train at full speed that kissed you frontally. Already the first roaring riff of Mantas appeared as the embodiment of belligerence. Directly afterwards, the rhythm section began to make noise and the inferno was complete.\n\nIn a nutshell, this 7\" presented two very different songs of the highest quality and made one\u00b4s blood run cold. During this period, Venom\u00b4s chemistry guaranteed an amazing level of harshness, meanness and sonic Satanism. Irrespective of the individual song pattern, almost each and every track came directly to the point. But regardless of the strong internal competition, it is definitely a shame that great songs like \"In Nomine Satanas\" were never part of a regular studio album. It would have deserved a more prominent place. Anyway, everything is fine as long as this is the only problem.\n",
        "\nIrrespective of their musical content, products such as \"...Tear Your Soul Apart\" cannot expect high ratings. There is a very simple reason for this. They are not based on creativity. Instead, these releases are driven by commercial interests. They do not stand on their own feet while offering a crude mix of new and well-known tracks. Well, the new songs were not really new but leftovers of \"Prime Evil\". Yet in view of the strength of this full-length, the leftovers also achieve a (more or less) solid quality level. \"The Ark\" gains the upper hand in the internal competition. Its opening riff flows into smooth guitar lines which reveal an unexpected closeness to the typical Maiden hooks. The catchy chorus as well as the melodic guitar solo add further value to the song. Like always, the Demolition Man on vocals makes a positive contribution to the overall result.\n\nContrariwise, \"Civilised\" doubtlessly emanates the aura of an outtake. It appears as the embodiment of mediocrity. Its melody line has no impact. Adequately produced, it is no waste of time to listen to this piece. But the black metal vanguards from the United Kingdom have written dozens of significantly better songs so that the release of this track does not make sense. Quite the opposite, it underlines the unkindness of this compilation.\n\nLet me not beat about the bush, the live tracks are typical fillers. They do not convey the feeling of a live concert and, to be honest, I am generally not a great fan of live recordings. Aggravating this situation, both \"Bursting Out\" and \"Angel Dust\" are okay, but they did never belong to my favourite tracks of the once chaotic gang. But love them or hate them, one thing is certain. There was absolutely no need to put them on this release. Their only function is the lengthening of the playtime. Unfortunately, the same goes for the new studio version of \"Skool Daze\", which suffers from an amateurish fade-out. Sodom\u00b4s original version of \"Outbreak of Evil\" sends its greetings!\n\nWhat remains is a more or less unnecessary cover version of Priest\u00b4s \"Hellbent\". It possesses a snotty charm, but cover songs can never constitute a sales argument. Therefore, I guess it is time to bring this review to an end. If you have never before been in contact with Venom, these 19 minutes of fairly harsh metal will entertain you. Otherwise, I can see almost no reason to buy this output. Not to mention the idiotic artwork.\n",
        "\nYou surely know these Chinese fortune cookies. I had great expectation when I ate one for the first time. I thought that my heart will burst of joy. But nothing happened. The cookie had no effect. It just did not work. You surely know Venom, too. I have great expectation whenever I buy an album of these heroes of my youth. This also applied to the purchase of \"Metal Black\". But as in the case of the cookie, nothing happened. \"Metal Black\" does not work.\n\nCronos says \"Antechrist\" and the rumbling begins. With a remarkable affinity to crummy compositions, the band performs songs that should have never come to life. Thrilling riffs do not enter this sonic desert. Hooks are almost completely unknown. Additionally, there are no melodies that scream: I want you to keep me in mind. Cronos and the servile boys at his side start to play in the middle of nowhere and they end on the very spot. There is no dynamic, no direction and no master plan. Neither the crude charm of the early days nor the necessary amount of rational professionalism is present. Instead, the band delivers a seemingly endless series of bubbling tones that match with the dull and emotionless sound. \"Possessed\" and especially \"Calm Before the Storm\" triggered the first crises of the band, but this was only the prelude to the signs of disintegration that became obvious on \"Metal Black\" and \"Hell\".\n\nThe choruses were poorly constructed. Cronos barked monotonously some stupid words without showing any esprit. I really do not have a clue why they recorded 14 songs in view of the fact that they were not able to compose just one absolutely exciting track. Worse still, they did not shy away from self quotations. \"Rege Satanas\" offered the riff of \"Die Hard\" in a worsened version and the middle part of \"A Good Day to Die\" made reference to the slightly oriental approach of \"Cursed\", the opener of \"The Waste Lands\". However, let me start the audacious venture to look for positive aspects of \"Metal Black\".\n\n\"Burn in Hell\" had a fairly energetic chorus and its guitar solo contrasted with the rest of the song while creating an invigorating effect. The main riff of \"House of Pain\" tried to flatten the listener. Unfortunately, it was also fairly spongy so that the guitar work lacked a bit of penetrating power. Despite this minor flaw, the song reached a solid level. Furthermore, the band had placed relatively strong songs, for whatever reasons, at the end of the album. \"Hours of Pain\" combined dragging parts with melodic guitar lines and \"Sleep When I\u00b4m Dead\" did not lack of power and density. \"Maleficarvm\" had its moments. That\u00b4s all. The remaining songs appeared as a painful definition of mediocrity. And as mentioned above, the more or less polluted sound also did not give the necessary spice.\n\nFinally, \"Metal Black\" provides five more or less acceptable tracks. Not ten or twelve or even fourteen, only five. Honestly, after having endured this output, I must quickly listen to \"Black Metal\" or \"At War with Satan\". Alternatively, I need a Chinese fortune cookie that works.\n",
        "\nVenom is one of the bands that accompanies me since my puberty. As in a marriage, we have shared our passion for metal in good times and in bad. Well, the band did not take notice of this situation. But I did. And back in 1997, I was curious about their reunion album. But frankly speaking, \"Cast in Stone\" did not blow me away. I freely admit that it delivered an appropriate degree of heaviness and the compositions offered a fairly broad range of song patterns. In this context, the relatively epic \"Destroyed & Damned\" stood out. It was slow and tried to generate a desperate mood. Its most surprising feature was marked by the vocals of Cronos. He sounded like the singer of this permanently unsuccessful group called Metallica. Nevertheless, an interesting piece. But this tune could not hide the fact that the album\u00b4s overall impression was good yet slightly unspectacular. Its carefully constructed songs were unable to compensate for the lack of creative unpredictability. Well, I do not want to criticize the output too harshly. To be more accurate, let me say that the once fascinating combination of immorality and insanity did not reappear. Songs like \"Red Light Fever\" or \"Teacher\u00b4s Pet\" were unthinkable. To end on a poetic note, Venom had lost its soul.\n\nAs mentioned above, the album proved that Venom was still interested in making noise. It was just problematic that Cronos and his two comrades - or should I say \"business partners\" - tried to impress with a voluminous work. Venom unloaded 14 songs in order to make clear that they had great ambitions, but the high degree of quantity could not offset the partial lack of quality. After a good start with songs like the powering \"All Devils Eve\", the fast-paced \"Raised in Hell\" and the well-accentuated \"Domus Mundi\" with its tribal drums at the beginning, some tracks lacked of memorable parts. \"Flight of the Hydra\" springs to my mind in this context. It had nothing to offer but the recycled riff of \"Bloodlust\" and stupidly hammering drums. However, the band bundled its forces so that, for example, the vocals of Cronos did not lack of variety or expressiveness. Yet it became apparent that the original three-piece did no longer possess the former chemistry. Additionally, the previous euphoria did not show up. \"Cast in Stone\" was the result of an experienced band that made a good job. In terms of heaviness, it was in line with expectations. But I would like to emphasize once again that one could discuss whether it was suitable to revitalize the glorious name \"Venom\". From a present-day perspective, it seems to be a logical development that this album remained the last work of Mantas, Abaddon and Cronos.\n\nWhile having an eye on a contemporary production, Venom ensured a powerful appearance of \"Cast in Stone\". I guess that there was no alternative to this decision, even though this sound did not evoke associations with their classic works. You cannot have everything. When leaving the early albums out of consideration, the production earned recognition. Due to its highlights and the appropriate sound, the full-length had the potential for a rating of 85 percent. Unfortunately, Venom lacked of courage so that they recorded songs like \"Judgement Day\" instead of dropping them in order to shorten and solidify the result. This sin of omission could not be compensated, neither by the highlights of the regular album nor by the songs of the bonus disc. It offered a relatively crude mix of classics and the exclusive (and not very exciting) mid-paced band anthem \"Venom\" which was previously only performed on stage. But anyway, the positive aspects of \"Cast in Stone\" prevailed. It deserves to be heard.\n",
        "\nWhen having a look at the ratings of the other review writers, I am really surprised about their high valuations. Of course, I respect their opinions. I just have to admit that I cannot share their point of view. In my humble opinion, \"Hell\" is as attractive as a rotten egg. It stinks terribly. Neither brutal nor entertaining, Cronos and his bodyguards maltreat their instruments in the most boring manner. I do not remember great riffs, haunting melodies or catchy parts. Instead, I am almost shocked by the lack of creativity. Not to mention the sound. The blunt and muffled production is abominable. It belongs to the worst recordings in the history of Venom. The low-tuned guitars are harmless, Cronos is sparing with interesting vocal lines and the powerless drums sound gruesomely. With very few exceptions, the songwriting process has led to meaningless pieces of sonic pollution. In particular the chugging guitar sucks. Believe me, it is hard for me to write such a review with regard to the merits of the black metal inventors.\n\nBut in order to bring the truth to light, let\u00b4s focus, for example, on the vocals. If you take the booklet and read the lyrics with a monotonous and dull voice, you imitate the expressionless performance of Cronos in an almost perfect manner. Maybe you also like to growl like a dog from time to time in order to be the perfect copycat. However, any kind of original vocal acrobatics does not show up on \"Hell\". The lyrical content itself makes me shiver. \"USA - USA - A satanic nation / USA - USA - USA - USA for Satan\". My simple advise is: do not call yourself Cronos if you want to deal with political issues. I still hope that this was just a parody. But I fear that the guys really want to be taken seriously. However, one might be able to overlook such lyrical nonsense as long as the music reaches at least a fairly good level. Unfortunately, this is absolutely not the case. Well, two songs attract attention. \"Hand of God\" is distantly related to the original \"Manitou\". The here presented tune is also based on an unusual and dominant contribution of the drums. \"Evil Perfection\" offers a more or less thrilling riff and a relatively vibrant chorus. That is sufficient in order to stand out, even in view of the fact that the song also presents some mediocre guitar lines.\n\nDespite a few interesting moments, the remaining tracks reveal a blurred mishmash of deep tones that do not make sense. To express it cynically, the highly original title of the album does not only mark a new triumph of creativity. Additionally, it can be understood as an omen at the same time. Unfortunately, it is a very bad omen for the entire unimaginative album. Its songs are interchangeable and colourless, not least because of the uninspired guitar solos. They are totally negligible. Summing up, Venom\u00b4s black metal never shined with spirituality. But despite changing line-ups, the band always proved its capability to perform a good mix of serious compositions and chaotic or funny outbursts. \"Hell\" is different. It wants to generate an atmosphere of negativity. But this experiment fails completely.\n",
        "\nI do not know why, but all of my durable favourite bands such as Exodus or Necrodeath have two things in common. Firstly, and that is a matter of course in this context, they have released tons of good songs. Secondly, and this is a pity, none of them was immune against stylistic aberrations. Venom is unfortunately no exception to this. Quite the opposite, the rapid decline of the band remains almost unique. Their temporary confusion is documented by \u201cCalm Before the Storm\u201d.\n\nCronos had seemingly taken the wrong pills for breakfast. He tried to set a new course without taking appropriate consideration of the risks. The songs sounded more polished than before. Already the completely harmless opener failed to reach the usual level of aggression and subliminal madness. Vice versa, the unorthodox approach of their first three albums was a thing of the past. This aspect alone was suitable to ruin the reputation of the once glorious formation. Cronos made the attempt to sing in a conventional manner. The result was miserable. Aggravating this situation, the background vocals also drove me crazy. Those of you who have a masochistic tendency are invited to listen to the dissonant and dilettantish choruses of \u201cUnder a Spell\u201d or \u201cThe Beauty and the Beast\u201d. \n\nBut the vocal performances marked only one of many negative features of the album. The absence of gripping compositions was its greatest deficit. Ineffective riffs were combined with insubstantial choruses. The predictable song formulas left no doubt about the creative perplexity of the band. And as if that were not enough, the feeble solos also revealed a painfully obvious lack of ideas. Mantas had left the band. He had been replaced by two completely unknown guitarists. But these henchmen were not able to create \u201cvenomous\u201d lines. In view of the here described product, I am sure that Mantas gave himself a pat on the back for leaving the sinking ship called Venom in time.\n\nThe cover artwork looked cheap and the album sleeve was not generous with information. In the run-up of the release of \u201cCalm Before the Storm\u201d, Cronos had proclaimed the restart of the band. Now we had to realize that this announcement had been nothing but an empty promise. The band was running out of ideas. Everybody could see it. Leisurely flowing tracks such as \u201cThe Chanting of the Priest\u201d had nothing to do with the uncontrollable insanity which had previously been associated with the name of Venom. Furthermore, the relatively slack production failed to put the pieces in the right light. Anyway! These shabby numbers did not deserve a vigorous sound. Only two or three more or less good songs such as the fairly dynamic \u201cKrackin\u00b4 Up\u201d improved the overall impression slightly. But generally speaking, \u201cFart Before the Storm\u201d - did I write the title correctly? - was a ridiculous work and a big disappointment.\n",
        "\nJesus Christ was only 33 years old when he was nailed to the cross. Venom\u00b4s debut has been released 34 years ago, but the band is still standing strong. It seems as if this is the ultimate Satanic victory. But appearances are deceptive. The British ruffians were actors in a devilish game, no more, no less. What really counts is the fact that the group has become an institution. This sounds very formally. But as you probably know, the first deeds of Venom did not fit into any kind of format. The omnipresent \"do what thou wilt\" maxime led to a crude and raw mix. But far more than that, this debut was truly innovative. Maybe it was that kind of innovation nobody had been waiting for. Nevertheless, Venom had proved their pioneer spirit. This deserved our respect...\n\n...although the music itself did not convince in every aspect. Due to the newcomer status of the unorthodox formation, it came as no surprise that some of the songs lacked of coherence and maturity. But Venom had also written a couple of gripping tracks that unleashed a sonic storm of destruction. Despite its gargantuan heaviness, \"Poison\" was well accessible. Its traditional song pattern appeared as the counterweight to the controversial sound which was focused on darkness and evil. Venom chose the same song formula for the fantastic \"In League with Satan\". The vocals - with a lot of reverb on it - and the humming main riff created a discomforting mood. Nevertheless, this track took another path. Less offensive, but maliciously crawling like a poisonous snake and equipped with a very simple yet extremely sinister chorus. The characterising drum rhythm could also not be ignored. It reminded me of an Indian war drum. Abaddon was probably not the most talented drummer, but he fulfilled his task in an effective manner. This was Venom at its best.\n\nThe massive spectacle had its ups and downs. For example, the roaring opener did not lack of noisy intensity, but unfortunately, this remained its only significant feature. \"Live Like an Angel (Die Like a Devil)\" was based upon a riff which had been too dirty for Mot\u00f6rhead. But this alone was not enough and the song failed to deliver a tight chorus. Generally speaking, some details did not fit together. The songwriting skills were not yet fully developed and this circumstance led to a certain number of crude breaks. I do not want to exclude that some of them were probably intended. Nevertheless, this was not the kind of song configuration that I highly appreciated. Additionally, I have to make the critical comment that the solos of Mantas did not enrich the songs. He just seemed to improvise disharmonic tone sequences. But I have to watch out that I do not give the wrong impression. In view of doubtlessly strong songs like \"One Thousand Days in Sodom\" (sluggish verses, dynamic chorus) or \"Witching Hour\" (dangerous bass tones at the beginning, afterwards up-tempo sections), this debut indicated the numerous options of the bellicose three-piece. Furthermore, we have to consider that this debut gave the starting signal for a musical - or unmusical... - revolution, which we all enjoy.\n\nFinally, let me specify the description of the sound. The bass guitar of Cronos played definitely an important role. As a result, the sound did not lack of depth. As if that were not enough, it delivered this strange mix of eye-catching Satanism, anti-social behaviour and indecent fun. I am not sure whether Jesus Christ would have loved this debut. But I will ask him exactly this question as soon as possible. Do not forget that he is always good for a surprise. Just think of all these catastrophes and wars on earth, although his disciples say that he loves us. Really astonishing. In this light, \"Welcome to Hell\" constitutes an interesting option.\n",
        "\n\"Black Metal\" was the last album that Venom released before I got in contact with the band. This was the reason why \"At War with Satan\" became my initial impulse in terms of black metal. Otherwise, it would have been the here presented groundbreaking full-length. Its relevance for the development of extreme music cannot be denied. With \"Welcome to Hell\", Venom had begun to readjust the coordination system of popular music. \"Black Metal\" marked the provisional climax of their work.\n\nDuring the last 33 years, we had the chance to get used to the harshness of the opening title track. It sounds familiar and almost smooth. But in 1982, the merciless approach of Venom was nothing less than a revolution. Okay, it was the continuation of the rebellion which had started with their debut. But it became obvious that Venom did no longer behave like a bastard of punk and metal that was fed with an overdose of crudeness. Indeed, the wording pointed in the right direction. The album offered black METAL. It was enriched with some really original special effects. Already the crunching beginning of the title track left its mark. I have read an interview with Abaddon where he described this noise as a \"teeth grinding racket\". I could not have put it better. The ridiculous voice of the preacher at the beginning of \"Buried Alive\" was a further great idea. He sounded like a moronic wimp so that he symbolized the (real or supposed) weakness of the Christian church. Finally, it was a clever act of self-marketing that the album ended with an appetizer for its successor. The fantastic opening riff of \"At War with Satan\" ennobled the here presented work ultimately and made the listener hungry for more.\n\n\"Black Metal\" benefitted from its well balanced mix of filth, relentlessness and vehemence. The outstanding tracks scored with different features. The title track shocked with its ultra-aggressive approach, while the first guitar tones of \"Buried Alive\" pulled you into the coffin. \"Bloodlust\", which was also included on my edition of the album, was the most thrilling combination of structure and chaos since the beginning of the history of mankind and its drilling riffs had a devastating effect. Finally, \"Countess Bathory\" offered the best guitar line of the album. Its violent catchiness has remained unbeatable. In addition to the high level of the compositions, the suitable production did not need to shy away from a comparison with that of their own debut. (Other possibilities for comparison did not exist.) The guitar created an occult atmosphere, the boozy yet expressive vocals of Cronos worked very well and the rhythm section did its job in an impressive manner.\n\nWell, one might say that every (strong) album has its highlights. It is hardly possible to contradict. But \"Black Metal\" additionally possessed an almost unique feature. While celebrating all that was evil, the formation took the liberty to perform the blues-soaked \"Teacher's Pet\". This humorous number gave rise to the question whether the entire album was just a parody. In hindsight, this seems to be the case in particular with regard to the self-mocking tendency that was stressed by the band on its later albums. Just think of \"Aaaaaaarrghh\". But we cannot ignore the crucial counterargument. Back in 1982, the scene had not yet been established. Due to this fact, there was just no object that could had been parodied. Nevertheless, it is amazing that the two-faced nature of Venom's work did not attract attention. Everybody seemed to be focused on their evil grimace. However, the later seriousness of a few Scandinavian musicians, not at least their criminal energy, appeared as an ironic - and sometimes tragic - twist of fate. It is no secret that they were highly influenced by the early works of Venom.\n\nI do not want to hide the fact that \"Black Metal\" also included a downer. The slightly chaotic \"Heaven's on Fire\" suffered from its unclear chorus. The remaining tunes did not reach the level of the highlights without showing any signs of weakness. For example, \"Sacrifice\" blended with the overall image of the album, albeit it was just a dark rock song. Thus, let me explain my assassment. It is the average of the music (84%) and the \"historical relevance\" (100%) of this pioneer work. In a nutshell, \"Black Metal\" belongs to the world's cultural heritage. Only the official confirmation is still pending.\n",
        "\n\"Temples of Ice\" was the second album with the Demolition Man on vocals. The crumbling band logo and the blurred cover artwork attracted my attention. Okay, I would have bought the full-length anyway. But of course, I like albums with a thoughtfully designed packaging. So far, so good.\n\nThe music itself pleased me without blowing my head off. A mixture of thrash, power and heavy metal was dished up. Because of the then modern trends, the once celebrated band seemed to be a kind of fossil, prehistoric and fallen out of time. Worse still, the group lacked of a clear conception. On the one hand, the album failed to deliver an appropriate quantum of filth and rudeness. Previously unimaginable, they covered Deep Purple\u00b4s \"Speed King\" without ripping apart the composition. This was an unmistakeable sign that the band did no longer focus on any kind of musical rebellion. On the other hand, Mantas and his sidekicks did not break with its loutish past. They still used the well-known band logo and some of the lyrics had once again a satanic touch. Nevertheless, the overall impression was too harmless to leave an unsettling effect. No doubt, the album could not be compared with their early classics.\n\nBut that does not mean that the band had released a flop. \"Temples of Ice\" provided, inter alia, the probably most catchy song in the history of Venom. I am speaking of the comparatively brutal \"Acid\". Due to its perfect combination of accessibility and insanity, it marked the outstanding highlight of the ten tracks. But \"Acid\" did not have the monopoly on catchiness. The strong opener, driven by a highly effective riff, turned out to be a metallic earworm. Its smooth flow and the almost loose and light atmosphere contrasted with the band\u00b4s approach during its early days. One could call it inoffensive, but from my point of view, \"Tribes\" was just an example for good songwriting. Unfortunately, \"Faerie Tale\", the downer of the vinyl, really suffered from harmlessness.\n\nThe production was pretty decent. Neither explosive nor combative, but clean, heavy and well balanced. It emphasized the pleasant flow of the single pieces. The expressive and powerful vocals of the Demolition Man crowned the compositions. With regard to a few average songs, the album did not lead the band to new success stories. But with the humorous \"Playtime\" or the fairly sinister \"Even in Heaven\", the guys also had some aces up their sleeves. And I have to mention the title track in this context. It marked the dramatic climax of the album. Venom mobilised all its energies so that they were able to deliver an intelligently configured final chord which surprised with a dreamful and surreal ending. I was absolutely satisfied with this album and I am still convinced that this period of Venom is completely underrated. \"Temples of Ice\" is a more than solid album and much stronger than relatively weak but better known products such as \"Possessed\" or \"Calm Before the Storm\". Give it a try.\n",
        "\nAlthough Venom's dissemination's policy appeared a bit strange during the first years of their career, \"Warhead\", \"Manitou\" and \"Die Hard\" formed a triumvirate of remarkable EPs. They offered a couple of songs which were actually too strong to eke out an existence as non-album tracks. The here presented 12\" scored especially with the title track. A gripping riff opened the tonal assault and led directly to a straight verse. The very compact song did not reach the sonic ugliness of Venom\u00b4s former outbursts such as \"Bloodlust\" or \"Poison\". Its flow was almost too smooth. But it goes without saying that, inter alia, the raw and boozy voice of Cronos guaranteed the necessary amount of discomfort and filth. It may sound strange, but his unadjusted vocal performance matched with the catchy guitar work in a very astonishing way. Apart from that, \"Die Hard\" had stereotypical yet well succeeded lyrics and impressed with its dynamic approach and the coherent overall picture.\n\nThe sound did not show greater signs of weakness, although the unpredictable harshness of previous classics like \"Black Metal\" was a thing of the past. Venom acted within their normal range. However, the well audible bass and the lead guitar fought a duel during the middle part of \"Acid Queen\" in a pretty decent manner. Irrespective of this, this tune continued the series of Venom songs about strange female creatures, just remember \"Countess Bathory\" and the later \"Lady Lust\". The universe of the British metal anarchists seemed to be full of very extroverted women. It made me jealous! Be that as it may, \"Acid Queen\" and \"Bursting Out\" were as straightforward as the title track without achieving its quality level. Not at least due to their short playtime of less than three minutes, they lacked a bit of substance. But they could also not be considered as throwaway tracks. Both were fairly good, even though there was no comparison with the real classics of the godfathers of blackness. In conclusion, this EP marked a pretty nice addition to their full-lengths. But only die-hard fans were of the opinion, that this release was indispensable. However, I think that every black metal supporter should at least know the title track.\n",
        "\nThinking back to the early outputs of Venom, I must say that their records always possessed a healthy portion of filth. The musicians were punk-influenced mavericks that tortured the listener by creating a kind of martial chaos. Sometimes it seemed as if their instruments were their biggest enemies. Nevertheless, the nasty yet self-mocking band celebrated major successes with its unsettling way of proceeding.\n\n\"Resurrection\" lacks of filth. It is a pure metal album which is free from external influences. Chaotic elements do not show up. The musicians master their instruments. And, for whatever reason, the full-length has not become a (commercial) resurrection.\n\nVenom released a solid album which scored with a couple of very well constructed songs. But the black metal roots are trimmed, although two original members, Cronos and Mantas, were involved in the making of \"Resurrection\". Instead, the band is armed with fourteen tracks that combine elements of heavy, power and thrash metal in a predominantly successful manner. The modern production stresses the voluminous guitars without neglecting the contributions of Cronos or drummer Antton. Generally spoken, the sound is heavy and vehement. It does not show any old-school tendencies. Do not misunderstand me, \"Resurrection\" does not suffer from an artificial or high-polished sound. But in terms of Venom, one has to get used to this transparent and clean mix. Once this has been done, it is great fun to listen to powerful tracks such as the riff-driven \"Thirteen\" with its flattening chorus or the stoical \"Firelight\" which reveals an amazing degree of catchiness thanks to its captivating main riff. \n\nBoth songs do not focus on high speed and this approach is more or less representative for the entire record. Legitimate successors of rapid bullets such as \"Lady Lust\" or \"Black Metal\" do not appear. Instead, Venom surprise, inter alia, with unexpected details such as an atmospheric chorus (\"War Against Christ\") and an almost balladic bridge (\"Leviathan\"). But however, \"Resurrection\" offers a fairly broad spectrum of metal that does not lack of subliminal aggression. With a few minor exceptions, the songs do not include tedious sections. They are solidly designed and do not have to hide behind the compositions of comparable power / thrash bands. It is amazing, for instance, that the vast majority of the choruses is catchy and intensive at the same time. With regard to that mature performance, the lack of spontaneity plays a minor role. The main thing is that the songs are not predictably constructed.\n\nThe compactness and the honesty of the homogeneous album are noteworthy. Well, it is surely questionable whether a relatively \"normal\" metal full-length meets the expectation set by the notorious name Venom. But further development is not a crime. To try something new is also not forbidden. And we may not forget that the raw voice of Cronos establishes the connection between \"Resurrection\" and their early classics. You should therefore lend an ear to crashing tracks like \"Disbeliever\" or \"Man Myth & Magic\" in order to gain an impression. If you like no-frills metal, this album possesses the quality to enrich your collection.\n",
        "\nPointing out that Venom zoomed past the last exit to relevancy years ago is like telling your neighbor he can save fifteen percent or more on his car insurance by switching to GEICO\u2014everybody knows that. Venom has been striding contentedly in mediocrity since \u201cMetal Black,\u201d a dull piece that was underwhelming compared to even the group\u2019s lesser works like \u201cResurrection\u201d or the tolerable \u201cCast in Stone.\u201d Albums like \u201cHell\u201d and \u201cFallen Angels\u201d seemed to have been made just to remind the world that Venom was still a band, in case you had endured a traumatic head injury and suffered from transient global amnesia. Cronos, the last remaining member of Venom\u2019s golden years after Mantas and Abaddon jumped ship once the joys of their reunion had run dry, continues puffing out more prosaic stuff in the vein of latter-day Venom on \u201cFrom the Very Depths.\u201d After listening to it several times, I\u2019m convinced Venom\u2019s ineptitude is now the size of Satan\u2019s penor.\n\nI can\u2019t deride the performances. Cronos and the other musicians have some heat to give off; Cronos\u2019 barks are sharp, and guitarist Rage has decent solos plastered everywhere. But \u201cFrom the Very Depths\u201d is ruined from side to side because the large components continue to fan the flames of the group\u2019s stodgy post-reunion direction. The lax, predictable texture of second-rate thrash metal anthems and the ample amount of mid-paced numbers continue to be the two tricks in the book. Here, the riffs and motifs they\u2019ve been regurgitating for years are staler than ever; Venom\u2019s beating of the dead horse seems like the only option. The lyrics are more of the same: I\u2019m guessing Cronos gets his ideas by pulling scraps of paper upon which evil themes and metal clich\u00e9s were jotted down out of a hat to come up with song titles like \u201cLong Haired Punks\u201d and \u201cEvil Law.\u201d\n\nVenom was never revered for exceptional songwriting\u2014even the twenty-minute \u201cAt War with Satan\u201d retained the raw, sloppy signature of the Venom moniker. However, the trio had a sort of charm to its disorderly rampages that is missing here. \u201cFrom the Very Depths\u201d comes off as a clean record, its sound quality echoing the polished drum and guitar textures of most metal projects in 2015. Yet the group is continuing to heave out traditional Venom cuts that try to conjure up the grit and raw fury of \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d and \u201cBlack Metal.\u201d The times have caught up to Venom, and the frenzied style that made the band\u2019s first few records masterpieces is rendered obsolete by tracks that are too predictable, too clinical, too uneventful, too bland to savor the flavor.\n\n\u201cTemptation\u201d is especially a chore to sit through, what with the shoddy mid-paced riffs stopping and starting and Cronos shouting the song title ad nauseam. \u201cStigmata Satanas\u201d and \u201cMephistopheles\u201d suffer from similar symptoms, two insipid groove-laden flops in an album of mostly underwhelming moments. The Mot\u00f6rhead vibe of \u201cThe Death of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u201d is enjoyable, and its brief spells of nostalgia are acceptable, but \u201cFrom the Very Depths\u201d is mostly a vapid listen. The fact that it lasts for over fifty minutes makes the experience far too fattening for its own good, and I think I wouldn\u2019t have let this one slide even if it had come with two complimentary harlots from Hell. Hey, one could say Venom has fallen to the very depths! Nyuck nyuck! \n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nOf course, there is no need to introduce Venom. The glorious early works of the band have left their mark until today. Thousands of line-up changes destroyed the magic of the British legend as well as lukewarm releases. I am not telling you something new when I say that the band is based upon the fame of days gone by. But Venom is always good for a surprise. Against all odds, the three-piece tries to impress us with a new studio album and yes, from my point of view, the old veteran Cronos and his comrades-in-arms are at least partly successful. They reach a remarkable hit rate while delivering ten good or even excellent numbers. Only the two relatively useless intros, the third title and the final track are more or less significantly weaker.\n\nThe Demolition Man, the temporary lead vocalist, performed powerfully. But Cronos shows on \"From the Very Depths\" once again that his rancid voice has its own charm. With the right portion of fury, his demonic approach is still absolutely convincing. Moreover, his vocal lines shape some sections of the album in an impressive way. For example, I refer to the verses of \"Smoke\". They thrive on his crude yet appropriate performance. No question that Cronos has not forgotten how to spell the words \"Black\" and \"Metal\", although the album cannot be described as a pure black metal record. The average velocity is surprisingly slow and the music combines again dirty thrash elements with gloomy parts. While finding the right balance between these ingredients, the band creates an atmosphere of uneasiness. Fortunately, the modern yet rumbling sound does not lack of vehemence. The bass of Cronos resists the powerful guitar successfully while setting its own accents. No instrument has received preferential treatment from Cronos who also produced the album. Quite the opposite, he did a great job. The mighty drums emphasize this statement. \n\nLet\u00b4s concentrate on the songs themselves while neglecting the intro that adds no value to the full-length. Already the title track attacks you with its intensive and original guitar lines. The song sets the bar high, but the group tries its best to fulfill the increased expectations. Inter alia, the band scores with a more or less diversified song material. I recommend to compare the haunting \"Smoke\" (its beginning reminds me a bit of \"Mystique\" from \"Possessed\") with the following \"Temptation\" which is based on double-bass drums and massive guitar chords. The different compositional approaches become quite clear, but that\u00b4s not all. The next track (\"Long Haired Punk\") focuses on speed while demonstrating Venom\u00b4s joy of playing. This series could easily be continued, but I guess that I am at risk to write a track-by-track review... Thus, let me try to describe it differently. Without delivering exclusively future classics, \"From the Very Depths\" avoids fillers. There is a mostly simple but good idea behind almost each and every track. Although the pieces offer a wide range of various currents, the band scores with an homogeneous output. I admit that I am surprised by the overall quality of the full-length. Honestly, I would have been satisfied with a 70% album after ambivalent records such as \"Metal Black\".\n\nThe compact album does not appear as the work of battle-weary metal soldiers. The riffs are effective and heavy, the rhythmic approach is not too simple and songs like the monstrous \"Evil Law\" do not lack of depth. The modern Venom sound like a band which grows old with dignity. Okay, some of the lyrics have been obviously written under the influence of drugs. I have no other explanation for nonsensical lines such as \"We\u00b4re killing Kid Creole\". Nevertheless, my conclusion is that this is the best output under the banner of Venom since \"The Waste Lands\", at least if it stands the test of time. But even if that is not the case, \"From the Very Depths\" enriches the discography of a legend and whets the appetite for more. If you are still uncertain about the album\u00b4s quality, just listen to late highlights like \"Mephistopheles\" and \"Wings of Valkyrie\". (As a marginal note, the latter one offers a short German line \"eins, zwei, drei, vier\". It goes without saying that I like it...) Thumbs up for an unfussy and authentic full-length, although the band\u00b4s classics like \"At War with Satan\" are out of reach.\n",
        "\nWhere would we be without this group of British brutes? How would countless millions have faired without the crude, blurry blueprints of black and death metal drawn up at the dawn of the 80s? And who would have thought that some blokes just making intentionally controversial noise (while not being all that proficient at their instruments...they really weren't back then, admit it) could have had such a gigantic impact? But I don't have to tell you that, now do I? Nope, I'm here, instead, to see what the legendary trio has been up to in the past year or so, with this being the result...\n\nNow I've not exactly been the biggest Venom fan in the world (in fact, I'm not all that keen on the required listens for what they're worth...), so as it stands individually \"From the Very Depths\" certainly has its fair share of bite mixed with a seriously old school vibe, that indescribable force that's felt but can't be explained all that well. Still maintaining the feel of \"The Devil's Motorhead\" yet still being as Venomous as they've ever been, this kind of material doesn't warrant any sort of deep-seeking or thinking, oh no sirree...everything about \"From the Very Depths\" is delightfully two-dimensional, straightforward and, above all else, rockin'. Songs are easy to get into, not too simple as to be bored with it yet not so complicated as to require a compass to progress. But that's always been the name of the game with Cronos and Co.; straight jacking right in your fool face from every possible avenue and every possible steel-clad fist. Vocals are snarly and twisted, guitars have a smooth rustiness to them, the bass has a slightly distorted bite and the drums maintain a clean and clear punch able to cut through everything else with plenty of power yet not a whole lot of depth to the percussive lines. And when it all comes together things are, for the most part, dark, dingy and plentifully heavy, but occasionally a fun, almost jaunty tune comes your way (the verse progressions of \"Stigmata Satanas\" get the feet a'tappin', surprisingly enough, as does the harmonic lead section of \"Wings of Valkyrie\".).\n\nIt's quite noticeable that the band had, at least, a jolly ol' time bringing these tunes to musical flesh, and if nothing else this could be the brightest shining moment from end to end. I say this because, as the album progresses, the apparent sense of creative fun ends up ebbing in favor of a \"been there, done that\" sensation, curious to know where else the music can go and not really getting that kind of reward or payoff. From about \"Crucified\" onward, they're not really paving new roads or treading undiscovered territory either, and many of the songs run through a similar tempo and arrangement scheme, though not exactly ripping each other off outside of maintaining that singular sense of meter and speed. That tends to make the second half of the album drag on as you hope for something new to let you have it outside of the occasional different shift in focus (\"Ouverture\" is a nice deterrence, however, with its trippy, stroll-through-a-film-noir-city-at-night atmosphere, and the live(?) track \"Rise\" has energy to spare). So if nothing else, prospective listeners could very well get a kick out of the first half before the fuel begins to run out.\n\nSo ultimately, \"From the Very Depths\" is, at the very least, entertaining and competently performed, and as far as Venom goes it's definitely one of their tighter efforts, but the simplisticism and lack of dynamics tends to get stale the further in you go. But I guess just take it for what it is and you may find a tune or two worth your time. Maybe.\n",
        "\nWe all know Venom, the band that spawned a lot of what would become the extreme metal genres. They were thrash before there was thrash. They coined the term black metal. They influenced many of metal's heaviest bands all the while being part of the NWOBHM that sprung up in the UK during the late 70s. Although Conrad (Cronos) Lant is the only original member left, he has decided to carry on the Venom torch an astounding thirty-six years after their formation even though the band has disbanded and reformed several times over the years. Their most recent releases have been hit or miss and even though it seems that some have written them off....I haven't quite yet.\n\nSo 2015 brings us Venom's fourteenth full length album, From The Very Depths and it is this album that gave me some hope that this legendary band still has some life left in them. Now, granted, I have not heard anything since Metal Black, which was not a bad album, just not as strong as I would like. That said, I saw them in September of 2006 and they slayed, although the set was extremely short, so they have yet to put a bad taste in my mouth. Sometimes it's that bad taste that will prevent listener from even giving a band's new releases a chance. But when you have a song open an album (there's an intro that seems useless) like the title track to this album, it might be time to give the band another chance. This song just kicks your teeth in from the start. This is the Venom we all know and love, pummeling riffs, screaming solos, and Cronos's gruff vocals screaming about worshiping Satan. \"The Death of Rock N Roll\" shows the band's punk/metal hybrid roots with much more emphasis on the metal but maintaining the punky vibe. To round out the opening trio of crushers is \"Smoke.\" This is a slow pounding song that just pummels you with a doomy heaviness. This is Venom doing doom rather well.\n\nThere's more to this album than that trio, though. \"Stigmata Satanas\" is another evil sounding crusher of a song. The riffs are just pounding on this song and it is just sheer heaviness. Cronos is sounding as evil as ever. \"Crucified\" is another song that just slays with pounding rhythms and evil riffs. These might not be the most innovative songs that the band has done but that does not take away from the sheer enjoyment of the songs. These are headbangers, through and through. \"Grinding Teeth\" is a Venom speed metal song that has that punk vibe just hanging there but it's mostly crushing metal that only Venom can produce. It;s after that song that the album seems to run out of steam a bit. The useless \"Overture\" that leads into \"Mephistopheles,\" a song that starts off strong but falls away as it goes. This isn't a horrible song, but with the intro build up this should have been better. It just doesn't seem to go anywhere but leaves you hanging like there should have been more. \"Wings of Valkyrie\" plods along and is a skip worthy song. Sad because with a name like that it should have been better. \"Rise\" finishes the album and lifts it up just a bit after the plodding before it.\n\nSo what this album shows is that Venom is capable of writing really good songs. They should have cut their losses and released the album without the last four tracks. This album is far from perfect, but it's no turd either. Listen to songs two through ten, skip the rest.\n\n\nThe Elitist Metalhead\n",
        "\nIs there actually any point in Venom releasing new albums these days? If any metal band should never be able to exist outside of a certain realm it is these Geordie demigods circa 1981-84. A very long time ago of course, and with now 11 albums following that classic opening triumvirate they have never gotten close to releasing anything even 1% as relevant since, a fact that doesn\u2019t change with \"From the Very Depths\u201d. It is commonly accepted from open-minded music fans that all bands should be allowed to mature and develop as they please. That is wrong; Venom just cannot.\n\nAfter all then it is somewhat ironic that \"From the Very Depths\" rarely sounds like the Venom I, and most likely the overwhelming percentage of metalheads, know and love. There is simplified aggression aplenty throughout the fourteen tracks, but dip in at any point and you will find overwrought chugging lacking any sense of purpose or value; hardly a surprise given the career trajectory of Venom since their all conquering output in the early 80s. My first full listen was especially disappointing as track after track washed by with little to savour, nor anything of notoriety being expended by the trio that is now rounded out by guitarist Rage and drummer Dant\u00e9. Subsequent listens have raised my overall impressions from the very depths yet I can just hardly find the reasoning to implore this on any metal fan searching for the best of the underground.\n\nAt times sounding like fellow luminaries Discharge (\"Long Haired Punks\u201d), often like latter Testament material, notably in Cronos\u2019 bellowing roar being strangely akin to Chuck Billy (\"Evil Law\u201d, \"Grinding Teeth\u201d, \"Rise\"), and frequently like a modern day version of Carnivore, it all feels far too safe in execution. While Rage can lay claim to a few decent solos spread liberally across the album, there is more to lament than the inevitable loss of unrestrained evil that defines their early era as at so few points do I feel the band are stretching themselves in the song-writing department. In small doses the punky spirit of \"The Death of Rock N Roll\" is acceptable enough or the crunchy dynamics of \"Stigmata Satanas\" and \"Crucified\" would pass master if one is after this kind of simple, bass-driven riffage, but these belie an acceptance of mid-level mediocrity one would expect to hear from a young, local support act. This facet is joined at the gallows by a lyrical performance in which most choruses are spent regurgitating the track title over and over; although having never been a band for whom one studies the lyrics maybe we are wise to forget this?\n\nVenom will roll on regardless of the success of \"From the Very Depths\", sitting near the top of any festival line-up they approach as no amount of replay of \"Welcome to Hell\" and \"Black Metal\" material shall ever suffice metaldom. But don\u2019t expect to get too worked up over this latest offering as its bland ideas and derivative songs are what I would more commonly expect from a band starting out today, not a band who predate extreme metal. \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nFrom my point of view, \"At War with Satan\" is a real cult album. It was the first Venom vinyl that I bought. This is certainly one reason why I have a specific relationship to this album. But I promise, the creative output itself delivers many other reasons to praise it in the highest terms. The crucial factor is that the British three-piece delivered an absolutely unique full-length. A bold claim? Well, as far as I can see, there was no blueprint for the gigantic title track. To be honest, this song still remains unrivaled. \n\nIt did not only use the entire range of the genre. It was much more than this: the title track redefined black metal once and for all. Everybody thought that this more or less one-dimensional genre was only fixed on pure chaos. But \"At War with Satan\" proved the opposite in the most impressive way. The song was very well thought out and enthused the listener with an overwhelming number of different parts. I suspect that it marked the result of a long compositional process. Just remember the fact that the opening riff had already been offered at the end of \"Black Metal\". In any case, it was a stirring experience to hear that the single parts blended seamlessly into each other without exception. That was by no means a matter of course, because Venom pulled out all the stops. They presented chaotic high speed eruptions, spoken parts, atmospheric intermezzos and, to top it all off, a kind of vocal solo by Cronos. I personally have to admit that it took some time before I understood what had happened. This was almost too much for a good thing. Already the first riffs of this titan were of such top quality that I would have enjoyed to listen to them for twenty minutes without interruption. But as said above, Venom had much more to showcase so that these riffs only showed up again at the end in order to close the circle and to indicate that the war between good and evil - this was the subject of the extensive lyrics - will continue forever. \n\nAfter this high sophisticated black metal ecstasy, the B side had a hard situation. (Honestly, I was at risk to forget the B side because of the monumental title track...) Five more or less usual songs and the nonsensical final number could naturally not compete with the masterpiece of the A side. It overshadowed everything else. Nevertheless, I am talking about five very strong pieces. Venom had refined its compositions while following a slightly more melodic approach. But this new orientation was not accompanied by a loss of harshness. The album just sounded a bit less chaotic due to smoothly flowing tracks such as \"Cry Wolf\". Mid-tempo was dominating, but Venom had never only focused on high speed rhythms. On an overall basis, the B side tunes scored with a well balanced mix of chaos and melody, pounding metal parts and high velocity passages. The main function of \"Aaaaaaarrghh\" (hopefully, I did not forget an \"a\") was to complete the album. It is absolutely rubbish, but it belongs to this outstanding full-length and proved the band\u00b4s self-mocking sense of humour. I think that\u00b4s the reason why I like it in a certain way. However, in my humble opinion, \"Cry Wolf\" and \"Stand Up (and Be Counted)\" formed the highlights of the B side.\n\nDue to its solid and adequate production, the revolutionary album sounded neither amateurish nor polished. This constituted a clear improvement after the rather dull and hollow sound of the first albums. The rattling drums of Abaddon were probably not to everyone\u00b4s taste, but their sound matched properly with the chaotic image of the band. Apart from that, the stylish cover design of the gatefold album was remarkable, not least because of the fact that the band quoted Shakespeare on the back cover. In the end, \"At War with Satan\" was not only the best effort of the magical original line-up. At the same time, the full-length marked its last work that was fully convincing. This might be an other reason, why I still have a special relationship to this outstanding masterpiece.\n",
        "\nI very much regret this, Cronos, but I have to tell you something: I really enjoy the Venom albums that feature your temporary successor, \"The Demolition Man\" Tony Dolan. If he would have been the original vocalist of the British black metal pioneers, I would certainly prefer his voice, although I like the unconventional vocals of Cronos, too. But so I am undecided. However, the main reason why I appreciate relatively unknown albums like \"The Waste Lands\" is definitely the music as a whole. The strong vocal performance is just one component of this. \n\nIn view of their early outputs, Venom were hardly recognizable anymore. Black metal was no longer on the agenda. The songs tended towards the dark side of thrash metal without neglecting atmospheric moments. Apart from that, the pieces offered a different songwriting formula due to their clearly designed structure. The chaotic times were gone. This development led among others to the fact that they had recruited a keyboarder for this album. Yes, you have read it correctly, a keyboarder. This guy got to work immediately. He was responsible for the intro of the opener which was a prime example for their compositional approach during that period. Feeble tones that seemingly came from beyond led to a fairly oriental riff. It matched with the lyrics about ancient Arabian kings in a masterful manner. The feeling of being lost in the desert was intensified by the instrumental part after the second chorus. Once again, our friend on keyboards took the lead...although this opener was not very harsh, it constituted a good start, but it was surpassed by the following three crushing tracks. Venom, in particular Abaddon, pressed the pedal to the metal while the guitarists presented riffs that were without exception excellent. The catchy choruses did the rest. Even after more than 20 years, this amazing triple strike gets my blood racing. The outstanding compositions sound still fresh. If the band had put these songs on a 12\", this single would have deserved a rating of 100 percent, at least in my opinion. But as you may have guessed, the following tunes did not achieve this ultimate level. \"Wolverine\" came closest to these three highlights. It thrived on a belligerent attitude due to its aggressive riffing.\n\nFor the full picture, two further songs have to be mentioned. They presented Venom from quite a different aspect. The craggy \"Need to Kill\" was dominated by very catchy drums and its rhythmical drawn-out outro sounded like it had been recorded in a metalworking company. However, this industrialized approach remained an isolated case. Even more astonishing was the final number of this full-length. The lyrics of \"Clarisse\" referred to the novel \"The Silence of the Lambs\" which was written by Thomas Harris. The composition itself proved to be a ballad with a subliminal psychotic approach. It is not among my favourite pieces, but at the same time it was a successful experiment. It seemed like Venom greatly enjoyed playing with the expectations of their fans. This already started with the cover. Just have a look at the colouring, the motif and the design. The minimalistic booklet admitted also no conclusions on the style of the music. Unfortunately, the band used a very ordinary band logo for the first and final time, but this was only a blemish. However, all that remained irrelevant due to the fact that the songs were successfully performed and the album was expertly produced. My advise is that fans of authentic, darkened thrash metal should spend some time listening to this record. You will not miss Cronos.\n",
        "\nI can still clearly remember the day I bought this album. It was a Friday in 1989. Maybe the week had been really exhausting. Maybe this record made me forget the totally disappointing \"Calm Before the Storm\" and the half-baked \"Possessed\". Anyway, I liked this album with the unimpressive cover and the plain packaging immediately when listening for the first time to it.\n\nVenom perform a high number of compelling pieces which are on a par with their classics. I confess that I had not expected such a strong result after the insignificant compositions of its predecessor. Admittedly, the album does not fall within the category \"all killers, no fillers\". Songs like the opener or \"Carnivorous\" are not quite up to expectation. Anyway, these acceptable tunes are just few minor flaws which do not affect the flow of the album or the very good overall impression. Thankfully, it can be noted that the vast majority of the pieces will inspire you. The well-constructed songs offer a high degree of variety and unpredictable musicality while avoiding any kind of dilettantism. Nonsense like \"Aaaaaaarrghh\" was apparently frowned upon - and that was good.\n\nThe gloomy \"Blackened Are the Priests\" represents the highlight. It starts with a monks\u00b4 choir that is followed by a malicious riff. The morbid aura captures you and gives you that special Venom feeling. Therefore, it was an ironic twist of fate that precisely this song was written by the new vocalist Tony Dolan. The mid-paced track culminates in a fantastic chorus before it is crowned by its intense ending. This arrangement contrasts with songs like the straightforward \"Skeletal Dance\" or \"Insane\" that put the focus on speed while offering brilliant riffs. The Sabbath cover \"Megalomania\" shows another facet of this line-up due to its fairly epic approach, the heavy riffing and the harsh bridge. It blends seamlessly with their own tracks and enriches the album.\n\nAll pieces are put in the right light. One cannot talk of an outstanding production, but the full-length is equipped with an appropriate sound. Contrary to their previous chaotic behaviour, the band members followed consequently a much more serious approach. They worked with high accuracy without creating a clinical or sterile atmosphere. Of course, the sound characteristics changed not least because of Dolan\u00b4s voice. But that was no problem. Quite the contrary, his powerful vocal performance was convincing in every respect. He made the right decision and did not try to copy Cronos. Apart from that, Venom had successfully built a bridge between their own glorious past and the present. This was most clearly shown with the final track called \"Skool Daze\". It constitutes the continuation of \"Teacher\u00b4s Pet\" without being focused only on humour. With regard to its pretty decent and coherent composition, it stands on its own. The same applies to the entire no-frills album which has stood the test of time in an admirable way. Thanks to its outstanding quality, Venom came slowly back on track.\n",
        "\nVenom\u00b4s reputation is more or less ruined since decades. This does not need to be discussed. But they were trend setters and therefore it is unfair to talk about them in an insulting manner. In the early stages of their career, they offered a lot of outstanding tracks. Two songs of this well produced 12\" deserve this predicate, too. Noteworthy is that these songs follow completely different patterns.\n\n\"Lady Lust\" constitutes one of their harshest pieces up to the present day. Opened by a phenomenal riff, this explosive tune is totally based on speed. The lyrics should be kept away from children, because the detailed description of the exceptional Lady is really well-done. Needless to say that the rough voice of Cronos creates a filthy mood. But despite its uncompromising character, this tune captivates the listener by its simplicity and catchiness. In conclusion, it can be described as perfectly balanced between complete chaos and cold calculation.\n\nThe lyrics of \"The Seven Gates of Hell\" do not deal with sex fantasies. As the title suggests, Venom get back to the lyrical subject that they liked the most. The text includes strong metaphors and Cronos performs passionately. The guitar comes in after an eerie intro and Mantas offers a flattening riff. It forms the fascinating verse of this mid-paced and epic but still very heavy piece. The slightly smoother middle part after the second chorus leads to a suspense solo with an oriental touch. Towards the end of the song, Venom bundle their forces again and deliver a grand finale.\n\nI find it amazing that Venom released a lot of exciting songs only on singles. I am thinking for example of \"In Nomine Satanas\", \"Die Hard\" or \"Manitou\". One might think that they had a surplus of creativity during the first years of their cooperation. This applies even considering the fact, that Venom of course wrote also somewhat weaker tunes in the early eighties. In this context, the title track has to be mentioned. It is just a solid piece of black metal that cannot compete with the other tunes. Additionally, Abaddon has serious problems to keep the rhythm. Nevertheless, this single was a demonstration of strength and it whetted the appetite for more. Thankfully, we did not have to wait long. \"At War with Satan\" was already on its way.\n",
        "\nAfter the extraordinary \"At War with Satan\", Venom had seemingly found a liking in exceptional songs. In any case, they released a very unusual piece that still remains unique to this day. \"Manitou\" did not have these more or less satanic lyrics what they were known for. But what counts above all is that the musical approach differed strongly from their previous efforts. The verses were only based on the voice of Cronos, supported by a very simple drumming. (Fortunately, Sepultura were still unknown and had not yet invented the nerve-shattering tribal drumming.) The guitars merely appeared at the fairly melodious chorus. Cronos just repeatedly sang \"Manitou\" while Mantas played an epic and memorable guitar line. It may sound crazy, but the sublime melody gave you the feeling of riding freely through the prairie. Last but not least, Abaddon contributed a simple beat that was partly provided with discreet double bass drums. To put in plainly, \"Manitou\" was absolutely fantastic, not only because of its Indian flair. However, regrettably, this was not the only song on this record.\n\nReferring to the 12\" version, two pieces adorned the B-Side. Unfortunately, the \"B\" stands for \"bad\". To be honest, you do not need to memorize the song titles. Both tracks went almost unnoticed due to their mediocre riffs, amateurish solos, irrelevant chorusses and fairly chaotic structures. Well, I must admit that it requires courage to speak of \"structure\". It is therefore evident that these ill-conceived eruptions did not have the quality to be published on a regular studio album and they never played an important role in the creative output of Venom. This does, however, not change the fact that you have to listen to the title track if you want to know the most spiritual tune of the chaotic gang. With regard to the early years of Venom, \"Manitou\" was a successful experiment and their last song that could be described as outstanding - and this applied also to the well selected cover motif.\n",
        "\n\"Possessed\" remains a mystery to me until today. I worshipped Venom due to their two previous albums and fascinating singles like \"Manitou\" or \"Warhead\". And the omens were good that \"Possessed\" would be the next great step. The alienated image of two children marked an unusual artwork and seemed to lay the foundation for another diabolic seduction. The distorted letters of the album title could have been interpreted as an indication of the expected earthshaking sound while the title itself perfectly payed tribute to their (more or less) devilish image. With regard to these facts, my anticipation was growing.\n\nBut I was wrong. The sound was the first disappointment. It had nothing to counter the malevolant belligerence of its predecessor and it was for sure not overproduced. On the contrary, one could think that the record seller had mistakenly put a low budget output into the inner sleeve. But the boozy and dissonant voice of Cronos left no room for doubts. It was definitely Venom who offered this dull and inoffensive sound which was characterized by tinny guitars. This circumstance alone resulted in a deterioration in comparison with \"At War with Satan\". Maybe \"Possessed\" was meant to sound unpure like their first albums, but this plan failed. However, the production certainly would not had been a profound problem, if the band would have written new soon-to-be-classics. Disillusioned, we had to discover that this was not the case.\n\nWhile their previous tracks came straight to the point, except the epic \"At War with Satan\", of course, the band seemed to seek a new direction. Some parts were seemingly intended to be more melodious or even trance-like, but with a singer like Cronos this was just a useless exercise. Venom were therefore not able to consistently create an unholy atmosphere. Take, for example, the beginning of \"Mystique\". It delivered a strained weird aura, but the weirdness collapsed as soon as Cronos raised his voice. Apart from that, Venom offered songs with miserable choruses (\"Moonshine\", \"Too Loud\") and mediocre pieces that had a few good moments due to rarely succeeded breaks (\"Burn this Place\", the instrumental \"Wing and a Prayer\"). The majority of the songs was pretty decent without any link to outstanding music. Only \"Flytrap\" was overwhelmingly convincing because of its dark melody and the double bass driven chorus. Nevertheless, you could not compare it with their real classics, such as \"Countess Bathory\" or \"Lady Lust\". Its lyrics were about the goddess Venus and she was not the only strange female being that occured in the texts. They were full of wild virgins, dying whores and little schoolgirls. Unfortunately, the merciless countess and the cruel lady did not reappear... It should be stated clearly, these crude lyrics were just nonsense.\n\nIn winding up, Venom had lost their way and did not play black metal any more. This album delivered a punk-influenced mixture of thrash and power metal. In retrospect, \"Possessed\" constituted the first explicit indication of Venom\u00b4s preliminary low point that became evident with the release of the following full-length, the very excellent \"Calm Before the Storm\" (just kidding).\n",
        "\nYou don\u2019t have to be a Venom fanboy to honor and appreciate the band\u2019s legendary status as trailblazers of black, thrash and speed metal and godfathers of the black/thrash \u2018n\u2019 roll sound. Their first couple of albums were undeniably fun to listen to: raw as hell, shoddily produced, technically inept and musically unrefined, but at the same time highly innovative, bursting with attitude, energy and youthful enthusiasm. Yet for all their historical importance, what have Venom really accomplished in the thirty years that have passed since \u201cAt War with Satan\u201d, by most accounts the last of their \u201cclassic\u201d albums? Sure, the band has continued on through numerous lineup changes and to the present day put out some more decent to pretty good records, but let\u2019s be frank: would we really still be talking about the \u201cPossessed\u201ds, the \u201cPrime Evil\u201ds, the \u201cResurrection\u201ds or the \u201cMetal Black\u201ds if they didn\u2019t come from the same lunatics that rose to relative stardom with the seminal \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d and \u201cBlack Metal\u201d? Hardly.\n\n\u201cCast in Stone\u201d, released in 1997, was hailed as a comeback album at the time, given that the original lineup of Cronos, Mantas and Abaddon reunited to show the world once more that no one does dirty, occult, NWoBHM-influenced speed/thrash metal better than the venerable originals. Mission accomplished? Nah. The three-piece certainly tries hard to recapture the (black) magic of old, but \u201cCast in Stone\u201d ultimately feels like a calculated effort that grows stale quickly, falling short in too many areas to really be considered a success. To a certain degree, what made Venom\u2019s earliest albums enjoyable was their anarchistic, helter-skelter vibe: the band was basically all over the place, playing much faster than their instrumental skills really allowed and threatening to go off the rails at any moment. The end result was often on the brink of utter chaos and it sure didn\u2019t sound pretty, but it also made for a hell of a lot of entertainment.\n\nOn \u201cCast in Stone\u201d, however, we get to hear an older, more mature version of Venom. The guys are still far from being virtuosos and \u201ctight\u201d is still among the last adjectives you would use to describe the band\u2019s performance, but the musical delivery is at least competent. In other words, everything sounds a lot more controlled than in their early days, and that might just be the problem: maybe it sounds a bit too controlled for its own good, if that makes any sense. To make matters worse, there just aren\u2019t enough fast, thrashy songs on here. Whenever the album speeds up and leaves the realm of stomping mid-tempo dullness, it gains a sense of urgency that\u2019s otherwise lacking; \u201cRaised in Hell\u201d, \u201cInfectious\u201d or \u201cFlight of the Hydra\u201d are good examples for this. Far too often, however, the album is stuck in mid gear and, save for a couple of tracks with great hooks and catchy choruses (\u201cGod\u2019s Forsaken\u201d, \u201cKings of Evil\u201d), simply doesn\u2019t do enough to keep the listener\u2019s attention, especially not for its entire duration of 55 minutes. To make matters worse, at least two of the songs on offer are more or less complete duds: \u201cDomus Mundi\u201d and \u201cSwarm\u201d have a more experimental and almost industrial edge to them, making them sound disjointed and ultimately out of place.\n\nIn the end, \u201cCast in Stone\u201d is not as bad as the above paragraphs might indicate, but it\u2019s also not the original lineup\u2019s glorious return to form that it\u2019s sometimes made out to be. It passes as a decent record with nice production (clear yet sufficiently rough around the edges) and a couple of pretty enjoyable songs. Those simply looking for some dirty and mean thrashin\u2019 \u2018n\u2019 rollin\u2019 will find some good stuff here, but those hoping for a truly captivating album, one that sucks you right in and makes you want to come back for repeated listens, may want to turn elsewhere. \u201cCast in Stone\u201d has its moments and can be fun for a while, but quickly loses what little luster it has.\n",
        "\nVenom is a band whose contributions to metal are so powerful that it is difficult to accept that they are also guilty of releasing \u201cCast In Stone.\u201d The year was 1997, and with worm Castings on Stone the band released their first full-length album to showcase the Cronos-Abaddon-Mantas lineup since \u201cPossessed\u201d back in 1985. Reuniting with the same intensity, chemistry, and passion displayed by a divorced couple chatting while picking up their children from a neutral location, Venom offers definitive proof that an all star lineup can mean absolutely nothing. Sometimes people wonder how bad music can really be when everything is produced fine and everyone pretty much knows how to play their instruments - this is the answer. While production and performance traits are typically regarded as strengths, they only make things worse here by allowing Venom to more clearly convey how awful the album is. Don\u2019t waste your time listening to this. Each one of the 14 songs is awful, each riff is awful, and each syllable gargling or growling out of Cronos\u2019s mouth is awful. Ideas like \u201cpassion\u201d and \u201cfeel\u201d can be really intangible with music until you hear an album like this that is completely lacking in both. As the band goes through the motions of making music, everything becomes so predictable that you essentially suffer through the entire faux-Venom album just by hearing the first note. Similar to post-traumatic stress syndrome. \n\nVenom probably reunited for around one hour and simply recorded the meeting because there couldn\u2019t have been any premeditated thought behind writing these songs. This process would have meant that everyone was on the same page musically, so the band had to devolve into predictable, pathetic, and poppy song structures and rock pastiches. Now, no one can accuse Venom of having ever been a technical band. But, when you have endless pop-rock styled \u201chooks\u201d in your songs and pandering choruses, it is a depressingly far cry from the band\u2019s influential and edgier past. Compare the gang chants on the infantile song \u201cInfectious\u201d that stupidly spurt out each of the word\u2019s syllables \u201cIn\u201d \u201cfec\u201d \u201ctous\u201d every fifteen seconds, with the classic \u201cTeacher\u2019s Pet\u201d where gang chants of drunken revelry create the sense of genuine juvenile lust and ribaldry. This album is a shamefully bald attempt to go in a more commercial route to become popular again. On each song you can tell which small bit of crap you are supposed to remember and shout to your headbanger friends. Interviews from around the time even show Abaddon citing Marilyn Manson as an influence. If that doesn\u2019t make you reach for the nearest antacid to counteract the vomit in the back of your throat, then maybe this album is for you. But when you have shit like the two notes that make up half of \u201cDomus Mundi\u201d farting around until the sun explodes, it is hard to imagine anyone liking this. (That particular song also has an appearance of \u201cshitty 90\u2019s robot voice,\u201d which for those too young to know, was a megaphone type vocal effect used to ruin songs before musical criminals adopted autotune.) \n\nThere is a rocky path for a band once on the extreme end of metal trying to become relevant again as quickly and effortlessly as possible. First, Venom starts ripping unrelated pages out of books like \u201cstock rock riffs that people who hate metal think are heavy\u201d and \u201csong structure for the cognitively impaired\u201d then throws these page into an ugly hat to write the next song. I challenge anyone not to become irritated after the 500th time that: Cronos says \u201cYou\u2019re All Gonna Die,\u201d Mantas plays the same pentatonic guitar solo again, or the band uses an obviously stock song idea. For examples of the default-setting nature of the album you don\u2019t even need to look further than the song intros. Clean intro? Check, \u201cDestroyed & Damned.\u201d Drumroll intro? Check, \u201cAll Devils Eve.\u201d Breathing intro? Check, some other shitty song. And there\u2019s more to hate! Each one of these intros is completely uninspired and could have been taken from a small cheap sound library and pasted before the songs that also might themselves be compiled from a rotten sound library. This sense of automation is so strong in the songwriting that it would seem like the band was engaging in self-parody - that is if it weren\u2019t so obviously poppy mainstream pandering. One interesting thing is how parts of the album manage to stick out as particularly musically repulsive in an album that has so little musical merit. In fact, the especially awful parts are the only thing clearly showing that the rest of the album is a step above worthlessness. \n\nEven the cliched Eastern mood of the final outro serves as another wink to the listener that says \u201clook at us, we are safe, please buy our album.\u201d Imputing these kinds of selfish motivations onto a series of notes is completely justified here because of how enjoyably filthy Venom used to be. For those who haven\u2019t suffered enough and need more proof, there is also a bonus CD metastization of re-recorded songs that really help to show how a band can destroy songs without playing any notes incorrectly or making productions mistakes. The intro to the second CD is also helpful as an obvious sign of the band\u2019s attitude when they have a spooky voice announce \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, from the very depths of Hell, Venom!\u201d A window into the band\u2019s thought process \u201cwe are still relevant, look how 90\u2019s tough we are, pay attention\u201d and a stark contrast from the moody monologues from the band\u2019s past. To be clear though, the band\u2019s past doesn\u2019t make this album any worse or better, Castings on Castings would still be an awful abomination of pop ethos imposed onto formulaic metal if an unknown band had released it. That would be fitting too, because this release deserves to be unknown. I\u2019m going to bury this album at the bottom of a 10-pound vat of hemorrhoid cream. That way, if I ever get a hemorrhoid so severe that I need to use ten pounds of cream, I can make myself feel better by seeing Castings at the bottom, all creamy, and thinking: \u201chey, things could be worse.\u201d\n\nOriginally written for Contaminated Tones.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026fuck your blessed trinity\u2026\u201d\n\nSince I\u2019ve never seen it, this video is a mild mystery to me. Conversely, I\u2019ve had the compact disc compilation for some time and I find its only mystery to be its affiliation with Prism Records, a label noted for its ear for music of the way more classical kind. \n\nFor reasons beyond our understanding and for lack of any other explanation (not that anyone asked, I\u2019m bettin\u2019), one presumably strange day in the mid-\u201880s, it seems Prism, a purveyor of such series as Great Composers, America\u2019s Favorite\u2026, and New Horizons (geared toward more eclectic styles of rock), grew a few wild hairs up its ass that would convince it to explore other areas of the musical union it hadn\u2019t previously conceived, but in our reality we\u2019d call it something like style slummin\u2019, and is an expedition that eventually led it to Metal City, where dwells the sanctum of the Babylon Whore that is heavy metal. \n\nImagine top-hatted and coattailed suits in the comfort of a Shubert-spiffy limo creeping through all the alleys leading to all the seedy dives in musicdom\u2019s underbelly that for years they sought to avoid like the plague, and it\u2019s in these neighborhoods that they\u2019d easily contract diseases from the shit Poison, Cinderella, Faster Pussycat, Tesla, and The Vinnie Vincent Invasion were smearing like rouge by \u201987. Don\u2019t need a Wall St. wizard advising the label on the logistics of success by getting into bed with these kinds of acts, and its vaccination is profitably-proven, easy for the masses to swallow, and bless their \u2018lil hearts, is even safe for the kiddies. \n\nImprobably enough, it wasn\u2019t the Babylon Whore of heavy metal that got pelted with Prism\u2019s pick-up lines, but her less friendly, more cantankerous, and all-around skankier sister of heavy metal, the one that crawled outta the underground who relishes the dirt in her teeth and the stench of her crotch. The shiny black stretch impresses (or maybe it was its mini-bar, which if they were smart would be overflowing), so who jumps aboard but Venom, Warfare, Avenger, and Saracen, and last but not least, their pimp \u2013 Neat Records. Free drinks, more exposure \u2013 hell, only Prism has anything to lose. \n\nMild research will tell ya there\u2019s not a band here that doesn\u2019t have at least a pair of full-length waxers keeping some sorta reputation afloat, so if compilations brimming with (or having at least one) limbo-trapped bands is yer butter n\u2019 bread, allow me to steer your personal limo elsewhere, but feel free to rubberneck as you cruise on by. \n\nWith the lightest fanfare in popularity (I guess) and sound (by a landslide), compared to the others Saracen is the prissy ride-along of the bunch with the quintet rolling down windows to announce \u201cWe Have Arrived\u201d, \u201cLove on Sight\u201d, and \u201cCheatin\u2019\u201d\u2019s creamy keyboard-slathered hard rock, all from their \u201984 Change of Heart lp. In their audible presence, all\u2019s clean, affirmative, and fairly cheery \u2013 the last to spread \u2018em and the first to curtsy - and aside from Neat\u2019s leather leash, don\u2019t ask me how they came to be found in the same dirt hole as the others. However, due to their out-of-towner style on this disc, they\u2019ll be remembered better than probably two of the others. \n\nThe next tallest is Avenger, a mid-level band as far as the company they keep here, whose oldest inclusion is \u201cToo Wild To Tame\u201d, a non-lp single from \u201983 (and an \u201982 demo) that with its up-beat briskness break out thick, traditional running shoes to be worn by \u201cRevenge Attack\u201d, \u201cUnder the Hammer\u201d, and \u201cRun For Your Life\u201d, a trio that earn a living on their sophomore Killer Elite lp of \u201885. Not bad, but not the life of the back seat. \n\nWarfare, now and forever a poor man\u2019s Venom, are only granted two battlements worth of space here with \u201cBurning Up\u201d and \u201cMetal Anarchy\u201d, with either being found in \u201985; the first on their Total Death ep and the other on a same-named full-lengther. Can\u2019t say I was ever much of a fan of these guys, finding their crudely-patched leather to be kinda generic in a one-dimensional perspective and less inventive than Tank as well as the other trio here punching holes in seat cushions. \n\nTo no surprise the big heavy of this four act disc is dastardly Venom, early evokers of metal evil that need not relive any timeline here since too many of us know it by heart. Scoring high with five tracks, Venom break more stuff in a studio than live on stage here and is a fairly bright two-fold stratagem on Prism\u2019s part (guided by Neat, perhaps), two-fold in that the studio stuff is oddball singles\u2019 craft (\u201cNightmare\u201d, \u201cManitou\u201d, and \u201cBursting Out\u201d, a feature on a range of \u201985 Assault discs) than regular lp tales, while the live input that normally doesn\u2019t interest me much jumbles eras of the band that can\u2019t possibly be too far apart to begin with (this \u201cWitching Hour\u201d renown as an Ultimate Revenge video staple that formerly lives on their \u201882 Live E.P. and a \u201c7 Gates of Hell\u201d possibly from the \u201985 Japanese Assault mix). \n\nNot a bad little get-together from a label that should\u2019ve flew right by our disgusting little layer of the world at 110mph. Not to be confused with the similar jacket art of Metal Minded, another Prism v/a assemblage impressively (all things considered) uncovering some of Neat\u2019s more found-in-a-storm-drain acts. \n\n\u201c\u2026pure filth was just the start\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\nIt was while I was on a trip to New York City a while ago that I came across a record store that was not like anything I've ever seen in the town I came from. Metal poured from the store speakers, and not just obligatory/mainstream stuff like AC/DC, Korn, Metallica and whatnot, but nitty-gritty underground Black Metal, ugly death metal, and even drone music. Long story short, I snapped up the Back on Black repressing of Venom's infamous cult classic 'Black Metal'. \n\nUpon getting it home, I was in the middle of vomiting my guts up, but I didn't care. I put this baby on my turntable and listened to it while vomiting into a bucket. If that's not 'kvlt' than I don't know what is. Real horrorshow. \n\nNow, I own the vinyl edition that consists of the Black Metal album, with a bonus extra disc that features bonus tracks of older Venom material. I'm going to skip reviewing that latter and focus on the main meat of the album, despite the extra disc being pretty badass. Anyway... \nVenom's Black Metal was an exciting and sometimes goofy romp through booze-swilling satanic metal passages accompanied by comical vocals about the undead, Satan, and... eating out your teacher. MMMMMMMMM boy. The sounds of the album is full of grinding, primitive guitars that sound like giant machinery churning and chugging, blasting off wild solos on every second song or so, and it's always a treat when they do break into solo, although the solos aren't as common as one might first expect. It's as if the band doesn't want to spoil and overdo them, which I think makes them all the more special. The drums are... drums. They keep the pace of the song, they keep timing efficiently, they do their job, but they don't go above and beyond and knock you off their feet with anything flashy. They're just kinda... there. But not to worry, there's plenty that makes up for that little flaw. Though the vocals drown out the guitars to an extent, they provide a power that makes it clear where this band\u2019s power and evil reputation came from. His vocals, completely atypical to the operatic sopranos of metal from the 80s, are pretty much grunted, gargly singing. Drunken chanting comes in every once in a while (the halfway point in Teacher's Pet being the most blatant example of this), giving you a strong sense of juvenile immaturity throughout the album, but it's never irritating. It's all good headbanging fun, and it's damn catchy too. \n\nWe start Black Metal off with the classic title track, which begins with a strange mechanical hissing sound, like a giant engine letting off steam (furnaces of Hell?). And then the grinding guitars come in, and soon you're caught in a swirl of simply-written balls-to-the-wall metal as Cronos shouts the classic tagline: \"LAY DOWN YOUR SOUL FOR THE GODS ROCK AND ROLL!\" And from there the album is pretty much relentless, the only real break being at the beginning of 'Buried Alive', where a deep-voiced Cronos gives the last rites ('Dust to dust, ashes to ashes', and all that) alongside the sound of dirt being dug up with a shovel. After that the guitars come in quiet, Cronos whispers a passage, and then the horns-out metal assault comes right back again. \n\nThe only thing that I find lacking here is variation and song structure. The songs on here--all of them--are blatantly simple, not really going out further than the typical verse chorus song and dance. There're a couple of structure variants in a couple songs (an extended solo section in Teacher's Pet and the slow, quiet intro to Buried Alive that I mentioned before), but other than that, the songs are quite primitive musically. I guess that's what this album is about--straightforward metal with little range, but consistent power and presence--but a little deviation from this formula somewhere in the album would have improved it. And don't get me wrong, this album is by no means monotonous. In fact, it's never boring. It's always a fun blast of the nitty-gritty metal that would later spawn Slayer and Bathory among others, and there is variation to be found here in tone. For example, songs such as Black Metal are dark and ugly, Buried Alive has a distinct spiteful gloominess to it, even after the intro finishes up, and songs like Raise the Dead and Heaven Shall Burn are in-your-face rockers. The songs lack structure and expansion, sure, but the album's general dynamicism makes up for most of that. \n\nOf course, I also can't dismiss this album's influence. It broke into what would be the first extreme metal, and one of the last significant Satan-based albums that don't look at Satan and all his bells and whistles with a tongue-in-cheek disposition. This was completely new, a landmark of heavy metal, and you can feel the essence of a classic dripping from the meat of the grinding guitar riffs that imprint into your mind like they were burned there by Satan's pitchfork, the maniacal country-bumpkin vocals spitting blasphemies at you, and the general rolling in-your-face atmosphere of the whole thing. This is and was a groundbreaking album, and I'm sure it amazed the metalheads of the day that only knew of Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden. A new wave of metal was poised to strike evil into the heart of what metal existed already--things were changing, and this album was arguably the forerunner of it all. Pick this baby up if you want a taste of classic, straightforward, fun metal, but if you're into the more sophisticated technical metal, you may be turned off. My favorite songs off Black Metal would be Don't Burn the Witch, Buried Alive, and Countess Bathory. Those are the songs that have the most power and presence on the album, the ones that gut you and smack you upside the head with their unforgiveable fire.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/\n",
        "\nLet me start this review by saying that I am a hardcore Venom fan. Fucking HARDCORE. Venom has long been my second-favorite band, second only to Black Sabbath, and I\u2019ve followed the band over the years through all the ups and downs, alt-rock trends, lineup changes and reunions, and noticed the general indifference of the mainstream and many who claim to be metal fans. I was there before the classic lineup originally fractured, and I know this band\u2019s music back to forward. The positive influence Venom\u2019s music has had on my life and my own music cannot be overstated. In truth, Venom has damned my soul, and I love it!\n\nThere seems to be a perception among some so-called fans that Venom released a couple of classic albums and then did naught worth shit after that, or that \u201cwithout so-and-so in the band, it ain\u2019t Venom.\u201d Venom has in all its many incarnations never released an album which sucked, although the critically-panned Calm before the Storm might be an easy target due to its somewhat more traditional metal direction. Fallen Angels will stand for many devout followers as the strongest album of the recent trinity of albums, being Metal Black, Hell and now, Fallen Angels. \n\nThe album starts off in aggressive fashion with \u201cHammerhead,\u201d a track which could be a tribute to all loyal fans which have followed the band for thirty years. \u201cNemesis\u201d is pure thrash mayhem, and on \u201cPedal to the Metal\u201d the band puts it to the floor. After several grinding, mid-paced tracks including \u201cLap of the Gods,\u201d \u201cDamnation of Souls\u201d and Beggarman, \u201cThe band then pull out all the stops for \u201cHail Satanas,\u201d likely my favorite song on the album, featuring a killer guitar riff and pounding drums. Guitarist Rage, no longer the new boy, makes the role his own, playing rhythms and scorching lead solos which perfectly fit the style of Venom yet never appear as a rip-off of a certain former Venom guitarist, and over the course of the album new drummer Dante shows that he means business, nestling comfortably into the percussive Venom drumming style as if he\u2019s been there from the beginning.\n\nThe second half of the album relaxes for not one second. \u201cPunk\u2019s Not Dead\u201d may be an odd song title for a metal band, but from a historical perspective Venom swallowed the punk ethic of speed, aggression and attitude and then puked it back up, forming the monster that is Black Metal. Cronos\u2019 trademark bass tone and sliding notes are noticeably present, and on the title track the mainman takes the lead, ripping out a Geezer Butler-esque intro on the 4-string. Other strong tracks include \u201cValley of the Kings,\" the thought-provoking bonus track \u201cAnnunaki Legacy,\u201d which focuses on the Sumerian myth of extraterrestrials who created humans as a slave race, and \u201cDeath be Thy Name.\u201d Seeming to revisit the topic of death incarnate as heard on \u201cOld Man Death\u201d from the Metal Black album, if you\u2019ve never been afraid to die, then this track is sure to change your mind. There\u2019s even a bit of acoustic guitar on \u201cLest We Forget,\u201d a nice but somber guitar instrumental, which will remind longtime fans of melodic tracks such as \u201cMayhem with Mercy\u201d from the classic Welcome to Hell album. \n\nIf you truly understand that heavy metal is, was and will always be the devil\u2019s music, then you can\u2019t go wrong with Fallen Angels, an album that stands side by side with the early albums that made this band's legend. Fallen Angels is heavy as fuck and blows the living shit out of most of what tries to pass for metal these days. If you\u2019re disgusted by former death metal legends turned metalcore sellouts, then Venom is your best bet for raw and evil music dedicated to the Lord of Darkness. His Satanic Majesty sits proud, and thirty years into the game Venom still play metal fucking loud. I\u2019m giving Fallen Angels a 100, because I fucking can. If you get what this band is about, if the philosophy behind the madness that is Venom resonates within your soul, I salute you. If you don\u2019t like Venom, go suck a dick. You are truly worthless.\n",
        "\nCalm Before the Storm effectively ended the first of Cronos' eras with Venom. Alternately experimental yet lacking in overall consistency, Calm Before the Storm was a direction that Cronos knew could not be advanced any further within the confines of Venom. Cronos decided to take his leave from the group and start his own solo career.\n\nAbaddon was determined to carry on the name. He managed to secure the \"band\" a contract with a new label using, ironically, Deadline-era demo recordings (which featured Cronos and Mantas) despite the fact that he was the only member of the band at the time. Needing to scramble a band together to get back into the studio and record what would become Prime Evil, Abaddon convinced Mantas (whose own solo career was a worthy but commercially underwhelming experiment) to return to the band. Mantas agreed on two conditions - rhythm guitarist Al Barnes (War Machine, who also played on Mantas' Winds of Change LP) and his friend and former Atomkraft bassist/vocalist Tony Dolan (Demolition Man) had to be allowed to join up. Abaddon, luckily for us, agreed.\n\nPrime Evil, the resulting album, is THE great Venom release that no one much knows about. This is a much more lively and rejuvenated Venom, one that had not been heard since the At War With Satan days. Everyone fires on all cylinders. The production is probably the best the band ever had, although Resurrection comes close. The songs are all over the place and also among the band's best - Blackened Are the Priests is a fucking classic; if that bass solo in the middle doesn't repeatedly kick your ass, you are just not metal. Yes, I said it. It's so hard to pick a standout track on this album. Every single one of these tunes is a masterpiece of the highest order. Harder Than Ever is great fun; Venom's way of reminding us all not only that they were back but that they weren't about to slouch, either. Of course, School Daze fulfills the requirement for a mildly chauvinist number, and is good for a laugh to take us out of the record. Even the cover of Megalomania is cool, except for the fact that Mantas didn't know it was a Black Sabbath song...really, Jeff? There's a little bit of everything here - a little thrash, some speed, a bit of doom, and a fuck load of confidence and attitude.\n\nThe band sounds great on this record. Abaddon is his usual unpredictable drumming self, and we wouldn't have it any other way. Mantas and War Machine are a formidable two-headed guitar monster, interweaving amazing solos and runs along with some of the best riffs to ever find a home on a Venom LP. And then, there's the Demolition Man. When I was a younger Venom fan I never really appreciated Tony's gig with Venom. Youth is wasted on the young. Dolan is by far the DEMOFUCKINGLITION MAN on this record. His basslines are manic and unpredictable and his vocal style is completely unhinged. So, he wasn't Cronos. Big deal. Listen to this guy. You may not be able to replace Cronos but Tony was just as great in his own right.\n\nEveryone who insists left and right that Venom isn't Venom without Cronos, get over it. This album can and WILL kick your ass and you know it. This is their best album since Black Metal, and they have not topped it since. Get this album by any means necessary. And one more thing, to close out the review...INTO THE FIYAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!\n",
        "\nVenom is one of those groups whose existence has been one with major ups and downs. After At War With Satan and the Warhead single, Cronos, Mantas, and Abaddon were poised and ready to take on a larger audience. Then came Possessed, which suffered horribly due to its muddy and distant production. At the time it was a grave misstep, almost undoing all of what the group had worked for since forming in 1979. The band started work on a fifth record, tentatively titled \"Deadline\", but Mantas was quick to realize that things were not working out with the rest of the band and departed Venom to start a solo career.\n\nCalm Before the Storm is unlike any Venom album before or since. Cronos and Abaddon decided to replace Mantas with not one but two guitarists in Mike Hickey and Jimmy Clare (or Mike H. and Jim C., as credited on the album) and also decided to shake up the Venom sound a bit. Instead of the usual women, leather, and hell of the first four albums and their related singles, the band (or maybe Cronos) decided to play a mix traditional and power metal, with emphasis on sword and sorcery lyrics as well as a few rock 'n rollish themes. Jimmy Clare doubled on keyboards, Cronos toned down his vocals, and Abaddon and the two guitarists added vocal harmonies to many of the choruses. The band was also afforded the luxury of a much higher quality production, which is a big step above Possessed. Sonically, it might be one of the best sounding Venom records as far as production is concerned.\n\nAnd then there are the songs. Admittedly, there aren't any real classics to be found, except maybe The Chanting of the Priests, which is about as close to the \"old\" Venom sound from before (and the only one the old school fans will know). But the rest of the material is all over the place. There are the typical Venom thrashers in Under a Spell (which ends up being the best of the \"sword and sorcery\" songs) and Fire, the slower, more powerful tracks like the title track and Beauty and the Beast, the \"rock 'n roll\" tunes in Metal Punk and Deadline, and, as with most Venom albums, the obligatory chauvinist offering in Muscle. The title track is a great atmospheric tune, with very tasteful keyboards. Fire is some brutal fucking speed metal; Abaddon's drumming is about as manic as he's ever been (and that's saying something). Under a Spell in particular is an excellent song and probably my favorite on the record; the solo in the middle is a thing of beauty. (Collector's note - the version of Under a Spell on the In Memorium compilation features a different mix with keyboards at the end and different vocals. The same compilation also has two outtakes from the album in Nothing Sacred and Dead Love.)\n\nVenom fans are rough on this album, and not all of the criticism is unwarranted. Krackin' Up, Gypsy, and Muscle suffer from some of the most banal and horrible lyrics ever to grace a Venom record. All of the songs sound the same for the most part. To make matters worse, after Beauty and the Beast the band never gains back any momentum; Calm Before the Storm might have one of the worst second sides on any LP. The two guitarists are competent when trading off on solos, but the riffs lack the manic excitement of earlier material. Mantas is clearly missed. Cronos' bass sticks out in the mix, and there are some fun basslines in many of the songs. Abaddon is...well...Abaddon. For those who know Venom in and out, this should not come as a surprise. Some of the songs that the band worked on in 1986 during the Deadline sessions, like A Bite Before Evil and Love Amongst the Dead, could have found a home on this record, but still remain unreleased.\n\nThe big thing that hurts the album (or at least lets you laugh at it a bit) is that in almost every song Cronos yells \"WATCH OUT!\", \"COME ON!\", or \"LOOK OUT!\" at one point or another. It's like the band had about three-quarters of the song and Cronos decided to improvise around the rest of the material. It's amusing on The Chanting of the Priests, but when it starts popping up more and more as the album goes on, it becomes tiresome. Hearing Cronos sing \"put some great white muscle in between your thighs\" on Muscle (in full-on lecherous mode, no less) might scar a few folks for life.\n\nThe band as a whole hit the brick wall with this one. It's not a bad album (I personally find it underrated) but it might have had more respect if it was either tightened up a bit with a few more songs or released as a Cronos album, since Cronos basically took the sound (and the guitarists) from this album and perfected the approach on Dancing in the Fire. The album is ultimately forgotten once it's over, and most times I can't be bothered to listen after Fire. Venom fans should at least give it a try, but it's by no means a required purchase.\n",
        "\nIn 1987 Venom put out \"Calm Before The Storm\", an experimental but fairly decent record that saw the band heading in a more commercial route with a more traditional metal sound. Cronos left afterward to pursue a notoriously short-lived solo career, while back on the homefront, the core band unleashed this underrated little devil. The year 1989 saw \"Prime Evil\", an album with a sound taking the commercial route but with a more thrash-oriented approach settling the boys in with classic thrash acts of latter day. But does it hold up well to the black classics?\n\nFirst off, the production is awful. Yeah I know how that sounds concerning Venom, but really. On \"Welcome\" or \"Black Metal\" the raw production added to the atmosphere (and even still voices and instruments were still fairly clear despite the mish-mashed quality), but here it doesn't sit well with me. Everything, while tolerable, is a bit muffled, particularly the Demolition Man's vocals. Oh, and what of then new frontman Tony \"Demolition Man\" Dolan (of the NWOBHM band Atomkraft)? He sits well with me, thanks very much. Just because he's not Cronos doesn't mean he sucks; haters get over yourselves. His style is good; he channels some Cronos-type growls and mixes them with Paul Baloff-sounding howls and screams, as well as traditional metal vox. His bass doesn't fare as well, getting lost in the production, but manages to come off strong enough anyway. Other new guy, and weakest link, Al \"War Machine\" Barnes is on guitar, 2nd to Mantas. He just isn't anything special; his riffing is dull and uninspired, and pales to Mantas' usual aggressive greatness, who on the other hand, shines as usual. Fellow veteran Abaddon rounds it out on the drums. His tenacious but cheeky \"I don't give a fuck\" attitude while pounding on the skins still makes him and underrated drummer, and one of my personal favorites. \n\nThe songs, for the most part, are bloody great. The whole record is consistently interesting and a fun listen. Some nitpicks though: I'm not crazy about cover songs unless they're done very well, and while the cover here of Black Sabbath's \"Megalomania\" is pretty good (think blackened and more up-tempo), I don't find it necessary. Even more unnecessary is the forgettable, overly fast cover of Venom classic \"Live Like An Angel, Die Like A Devil\"; what exactly was the point behind this? Another thing that drives me nuts are oddball fx-filled intros of songs like the radio static intro of \"Into The Fire\" or the incoming fax sounds opening the title track; another odd and unnecessary addition. But overall, most of the songs are a fun listen. The heavy aforementioned title track has good riffage and a catchy groove to it. Numbers like \"Into The Fire\" or the blazing \"Carnivorous\", while not terribly original, are so fucking fast that you just won't give a damn! Highly recommended is \"Skeletal Dance\" for its catchy chorus and some more groovability. A personal favorite is \"Harder Than Ever\", another really catchy, semi-anthemic song that probably sounds like if Kiss or Bon Jovi made honest-to-balls metal. Even then, they still probably could never touch Venom.\n\nOverall, it's no classic, but \"Prime Evil\" is damn underrated and shouldn't be forgotten as one of the band's more obscure creations. Be a bit wary of the production and the unnecessary addition of a second guitarist, but have fun with the veterans, a damn fine replacement for Cronos and a (mostly) killer setlist.\n",
        "\nIt's finally upon us. After months of waiting, colossal black metal band Venom has finally released their new album, Fallen Angels. Cronos and crew open things off with a cocksure, fist-pumping Hammerhead, powerful and heavy. Already a new Venom classic to my ears. The lines \u201cBlack Metal In Your Souls\u201d and the chorus \u201cHammerhead \u2013 Hammerhead \u2013 Headbanger \u2013 Headbanger\u201d should make sure this to be the bands new metal anthem. From the very first note to the closing title track, Fallen Angels is non-stop metal mastery. Even the less memorable moments, the few that exist, are still of the highest caliber where this brand of metal is concerned. In many ways the album harkens back to the days of Black Metal and Possessed, yet remains consistent with the more modern approach taken on later efforts.\n\nThe band sounds confident and focused and this is an attitude they never drop throughout the album. One thing that strikes me immediately is the great production. It's very clean, but raw and back to the roots, not overproduced like many modern metal albums are today. Just phenomenal. Sounds absolutely crushing. Of course, when you think about Venom, the first thing that comes to mind is the name Cronos. The years haven't dulled Cronos razor-sharp tongue a bit. If anything, his vocal venom is more potent than ever. One of metal's all-time greats, Cronos trademark snarl and penchant for creating infectious vocal hooks are the frosting on this concrete-baked cake. Hell, we even get a bit of Welcome To Hell-era screams and wails scattered throughout the album's 13 tracks. Just listen to the kick ass song Pedal To The Metal and you'll hear what I mean. Back this up with some awesome talent from Rage on guitar and Dante on drums and you have the ultimate black metal power trio ready and primed to lay waste to the musical landscape. \n\nThough Fallen Angels is not without its standout cuts, there is a real \"album\" quality to this one. Every single track is strong. No filler material at all. The notables are many though, including the aforementioned Hammerhead, Pedal To The Metal, and Nemesis with its absolutely hellish, old school thrash lick. That's no lie, the damn thing burns so hot you'll swear you smell smoke, like in the strong groove track Beggarman and the black metal roots in Hail Satanas. Add to this list the memorably-written title track at the very end, a heavy, viscous number that after a long bass introduction really get moving. A very powerful finale.\n\nSome of the songs on the previous two albums Metal Black and Hell did tend to get repetitive. This album is something completely different as songs change tempo and riffs are very often. One clear example is Lap Of The Goods with a great break in the middle of the song. So Fallen Angels has a good bit of variation to a certain extent. I mean, it's all in the context of Venom, but they kind of explore everything the band has dipped their glorious fingers into over the course of their 30 year career. You have the epic (Fallen Angels), the thrash (Nemesis), the heavy/doom (Hammerhead), and the modern/groove (Lap Of The Gods), and even the early years-era hardcore-ish (Punk\u00b4s Not Dead). This album is a Venom diehard's wet dream. It has everything. Compared to the albums since the restart of the band in 2006, it sounds better. It has more energy, more vibe. There\u00b4s more craft to it, with stronger songs and evidence they\u00b4re still head and shoulders above the many young pretenders they spawned.\n\nWhat we get is pure Venom-metal, served up with an additional side order of exemplary songwriting and an attention to detail and choruses that I haven\u2019t heard from Venom since the mid-1980s. It is right up there with their very best records. Yes, it is. The band\u00b4s first four albums have become so universal and iconic that it seems pointless to use them as benchmarks by which to assess anything that followed. Take them out of the equation, though, and Fallen Angels is unquestionably the best of the rest.\n",
        "\nVenom's Welcome To Hell, what can I say about this album that hasn\u2019t been said before. Upon listening to Welcome To Hell, you can\u2019t help not believe that these guys must have deliberately set out to provoke a lot of raised eyebrows and dropped jaws, as if to set the metal world on its fucking ear, to create product engineered to shock, both musically, vocally, and lyrically, perhaps feeling that the current heavy music scene needed a serious shake-up. I imagine this to be sort of like sneaking into a dance club, overtaking the DJ booth, and throwing on something like (insert your favorite extreme metal track here) and watching and enjoying the reaction and resulting chaos from the dance floor. This album and of course the band were so loud, dirty, and raw, they were irresistible, yet at the same time you cannot help but pick up the feeling that Venom were having a great time unleashing their pent up musical and lyrical debauchery as no one had ever done before them (note Cronos\u2019 scream of \u2018Whoooooo hooo!!' near the end of the first track, implying a party atmosphere). \n\nYou either love this album or you\u2019re disgusted by it and I\u2019m sure Venom must have understood this, too. I myself love it because it is so disgusting. In my high school days I relished the disgusted look on the faces of those trendy \u2018Duran-Duran\u2019-adoring chicks after I would proudly proclaim the \u2018coolness\u2019 of Venom. There is no way these guys took any of this Satan stuff seriously. The photos from the artwork of this album make it clear that they loved to goof off (the prototypical version of their logo here even looks quite cartoon-ish). This is in stark contrast to later \u2018black\u2019 bands such as Mayhem, who apparently took their name from the track \u2018Mayhem with Mercy\u2019, yet ironically went on to take this devil worship stuff very seriously and literally. No sir, Venom were three lovable guys having fun watching the music scene\u2019s reaction resulting from this exercise, all in good \u2018evil\u2019 fun of course. \n\nI myself was originally raised on 70\u2019s hard rock such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath etc. and when bands such as Venom appeared the very early 80\u2019s, I really didn\u2019t know what to make of them. In fact, it admittedly took time to digest and accept this new wave of extreme metal in general (including thrash, black, death etc.) to the point where it now feels just as natural to me as the 70\u2019s classics did back then. Up to this day, I have never heard \u2018extreme\u2019 and over-the-top music this loud, this sharp, and this distorted and I couldn\u2019t imagine it being any different. I still prefer the particular unique unrestrained hard-edged rasp bassist Cronos has on this one, the first \u2018evil\u2019 vocal style ever!. Welcome To Hell is in a league of its own, even compared to \u2018Black Metal\u2019 or especially later Venom recordings. Keep in mind that Cronos himself was only 18 or thereabouts when the album was made, which makes it even more intriguing.\n\nThe instrumentation in general is exactly as described in the back cover i.e. chainsaw guitar, bulldozer bass...well maybe 'nuclear warheads\u2019 is a bit of an exaggeration. Listening to it reasonably loud, particularly through headphones can quite literally give the listener a splitting headache. Mantas\u2019 buzzsaw guitar literally cuts through your skull, in which case it\u2019s a good idea to have a couple of Tylenol (or equivalent pain killers) on hand after your listening session. Despite the razor-sharp sonic quality that sounds like it\u2019s oozed out of the slimy depths of hell, the remarkable thing about this album is that the lyrics are surprisingly clear and decipherable throughout. I pretty much had the words memorized quite accurately well before I read an actual lyric sheet.\n\nOverall, the bulk of the songs sound very dirty, thick, and intense as if the guitar fed through a chain of distortion boxes and were played to the amplifier\u2019s breaking point, which I hazard to guess is something Mantas must have been the first to try. Not counting \u201cMayhem With Mercy\u2019, almost all the tracks have that thick, concentrated, near-monophonic production except \u2018Live Like An Angel\u2026\u2019 and \u2018In League With Satan\u2019, which actually sound more, shall we say, \u2018stereophonic\u2019. The drums sound quite up-front and ambient. Abaddon does not sound as bad as some may think, but then perhaps any mistakes he makes are probably often drowned out of Mantas\u2019 razor- sharp guitar and Cronos\u2019 bass. The interplay between the guitar and bass are highly notable for giving the album its ultra-heavy and murky feel, best described as sort of like hot lava slowly bubbling towards the surface. Cronos\u2019 bass playing style is very unique and integral to the album\u2019s sound and cannot be described in words. The guitar chords are hard to distinguish at first, but gradually emerge through with repeated listens. When finally obvious, the chord progressions are simple, yet very catchy. For lack of better words, I have to say the sound has a sort of bastardized \u2018rock and roll-ish\u2019 feel to it, as I personally consider the realm of \u2018heavy metal\u2019 as we know it today to be still \u2018in development\u2019 at that point. As dirty, loud, and lethal as it sounds, you cannot help but sing along to this stuff.\n\nA quick run-down of the songs themselves:\n\n\u2018Sons of Satan\u2019 bursts out of your speakers and wastes no time setting the evil (party?) tone of the album with its lines of \u2018Hell the deceiver, Satan's child, you're a believer, and we're going wild\u2019. This is perhaps the hardest song to make out the chords on, rather initially resembling more the pure \u2018noise\u2019 that your mom and dad had always told you they thought rock music sounded like.\n\n\u2018Welcome to Hell\u2019 with its plodding riff including the chilling female recitation of Psalm 23 (?) interspersed with Cronos\u2019 voice only adds to the \u2018evil\u2019 atmosphere. It is here where I would say that Cronos\u2019 bass sounds very unique, best described as a menacing serpent crawling and weaving up and around Mantas\u2019 guitar, setting the song\u2019s amazingly wicked tone.\n\n\u2018Schizo\u2019 is probably my favorite, if only by a hair. The easily discernible lyrics of 'Schizo' are hilarious and paint an unforgettable cartoon-ish image of an apparently harmless little fellow who supposedly turns into a maniacal killer at night. The chord progression is more readily apparent and catchy on this awesome track.\n\n\u2018Mayhem With Mercy\u2019 sounds like a pretty little acoustic guitar solo sonically encircled by a swarm of winged demons and serves as a fittingly brief interlude before the sonic carnage continues.\n\nThis lyrics to \u2018Poison\u2019 are disgustingly brilliant. The blatantly raunchy sexual imagery is loads of fun to listen to ('Sitting close beside me, hand upon my zip, don't bother to take it down, honey, it's about to rip!'). This also has a simple and recognizable, yet unrelenting guitar riff that if played loud enough can leave you clutching your skull in agony. To be taken in moderation, of course.\uf04a\n\n\u2018Live Like an Angel\u2019 is notable not only for its fast pace and cool reverb effects added to Cronos\u2019 voice, but the shift in production quality (similar to \u2018In League With Satan\u2019), resulting in a wider and cleaner sound stage that can probably make you think it was laid down in an actual recording studio as opposed to a dungeon.\n\n\u2018Witching Hour\u2019 is more in the vein of faster tacks such as \u2018Sons...\u2019. Its significance has already been well-documented in past reviews. One can see clearly here the resemblance to the fast drumming and speedy, distorted, and scratchy guitar picking revealed on later landmark albums suchm as \u2018Kill 'Em All\u2019, which more or less perfected and introduced the thrash style. \n\nThe slowest number on here, \u2018One Thousand Days In Sodom\u2019, is pure heaviness and brilliance, most notably in the shift in tempo preceding the chorus as well as the brief bass solo before the guitar solo comes in. It is here where one can clearly hear and appreciate Cronos\u2019 rough, twangy bass playing style that gives the album its character\n\n\u2018Angel Dust\u2019 is an unrestrained ultra-loud, out-of-control tribute to the drug itself, probably again done to elicit shock and disgust from first time listeners. Probably the most intense track on the album.\n\n\u2018In League With Satan\u2019 with its different production quality is what it is, an menacing anthem to Satan himself complete with a cool spiteful opening backwards message to boot.\n\n\u2018Red Light Fever\u2019 is hilarious with its priceless intro. The guitar is thick and insanely overdriven. Cronos sings about his adventures with a prostitute, including later what sounds like a short verbal exchange with the presumed girl followed by the unexpected sped-up finale.\n\nThe album as a whole is just as, if not more, extreme or intense than anything it inspired and influenced in decades to follow. I have never yet heard anything else like it in my life and probably never will. It is and will remain one of the loudest, dirtiest, rawest, yet enjoyable recordings in my own music collection (not to mention heavy metal history), and if you\u2019re reading this right now, it should be in yours.\n",
        "\nVenom and the influence of their music is now virtually taken for granted. You don't even have to have heard the music of this band to know that Venom were an innovator not only of 'black metal', but extreme metal in general. Albums 'Welcome To Hell', 'Black Metal' and 'At War With Satan' will never be forgotten by metal. In other words, regardless of what this band does nowadays, their fame is sealed. All the same, Venom are still up and running, although bassist and frontman Conrad Lant (aka. Cronos) is the only one remaining from the original lineup. 'Fallen Angels' probably won't help the band gain any new fans, but it's not disappointment either. Ultimately, Venom's latest will be enough to appease metalheads, without surprising them any.\n\nWhile I have heard plenty about Venom and their great influence on plenty of bands I love, I have admittedly new to their music as a whole. Nonetheless, I can identify a large difference here when compared to Venom's classic sound. 'Fallen Angels' has an alcohol-fueled party feel to their brand of ballsy speed metal, but the sound is much cleaner than I would have expected. There is not longer the black metal-inspiring atmosphere to Venom's sound, although I'm sure this is no new surprise to existing fans of the band. The music incorporates some great thrash riffs, and- to draw a modern comparison- this incarnation of the band reminds me of High On Fire's burstfire sludge. As a three piece, each member contributes a considerable part to the sound, although Cronos certainly has the upper hand. His distinctive balance between a rasp and melodic vocals gives a character to many of these songs.\n\nAlthough there are a few great riffs here, the songwriting does not spark any classic tunes. The opening anthem to metalheads 'Hammerhead' is powerful, and 'Damnation Of Souls' has a classic Venom feel to it, but 'Fallen Angels' doesn't strike me as a consistently great record. The lyrics here are fairly awful, revolving around heavy metal cliches that bands they influenced made tired decades ago. Save for a powerful closing title track and meager acoustic interlude, each song on 'Fallen Angels' treads the same territory. Finally, while Cronos' voice has plenty of thrashy charisma to it, his cleaner vocals fall flat more than once. All of this results in a passable, but ultimately uninteresting album.\n\nVenom still have something to say with their music, but some songs here ('Hail Satanas' and 'Punk's Not Dead') almost feel like a self-mockery at this point. Venom have done much better before, and although it won't repulse non-fans of Venom to listen to, 'Fallen Angels' seems like one of those albums that a long running band comes out with moreso to appease their fans than offer something truly fresh to listeners.\n",
        "\nReleased in order to support the full-length album 'Fallen Angels', Venom's 'Hammerhead' is a rock-heavy anthem to all things metal, and metalhead-related. At this point in their careers, Venom have nothing to prove, being one of the most influential bands that the genre has ever seen. As I noted when listening to 'Fallen Angels' however, their music nowadays feels more like a band attempting to cater to their existing fanbase, rather than offering something fresh to metal, 'Hammerhead' and its b-side 'Hail Satanas' will be nothing new for anyone who has heard much Venom before, but neither are poor tracks. The first track of this single is one of the most memorable tunes from the album, a mid-tempo rocker calling out to all followers of black metal. While the lyrics ('black metal's in your soul') are often cheesy to the point of kitsch, it's plenty of fun. 'Hail Satanas' will be even less of a surprise to Venom fans; yet another song in tribute to the man downstairs himself. Cronos is the leading man in both tracks, and while the bass is the least audible instrument, his voice is the most distinctive aspect that Venom has going for them at this point. Sadly, his voice can fall flat at times, particularly during the chorus of 'Hail Satanas'. Venom's new material is not particularly impressive, but it hasn't left a bad taste in my mouth. Most of the songs on the full-length follow the formula laid out by these two, so the single works as a solid sampler in any case.\n",
        "\nAs a man that goes back with Venom 30-years next summer I admit to a tremendous amount of trepidation when it comes to any post-Resurrection releases that, in my eyes, have stultified the band\u2019s unhallowed name. Already into the first track \u201cHail Satanas\u201d and hearing the ho-hum vision, I wasn\u2019t exactly impressed, but I\u2019m going through twice as always.\n\nI honestly went into this thinking it was going to be more assembled refuse from Cronos and whoever else he has in the shell that is Venom these days, but I\u2019d be lying if I said this album was bad. In fact, it\u2019s really not too bad at all. That said it\u2019s not the dark and horrifying Venom we\u2019re used to, so dispel the notions of a new era\u2019s \u201cIn Nomine Satanas\u201d or \u201cIn League with Satan\u201d right away; the opening track in \u201cHail Satanas\u201d is widely misleading in that the absolute danger associated with Venom\u2019s image is long washed away by age, a changed musical tide, and a lack of Jeff Dunn and Tony Bray. On that note, Rage and Dante provide a solid backbone to Fallen Angels with some very potent guitar work and competent drumming that often makes one miss Abaddon less and less when it becomes apparent he was the weakest link in the chain all of these years. However, no effective replacement for Jeff Dunn has ever been found for that original \u2018dirty\u2019 sound that is both necessity and longing element.\n\n\u201cDamnation of Souls\u201d is one of the tracks that call ever slightly upon the old-school Venom feel, providing a designated journey backwards for a brief few minutes as Cronos and company power through the track with not so much of a hint at reticence. This album is not a distant past glories re-validation for Venom by any stretch, but for its main function and purpose it\u2019s really more than just okay and will more than likely find a soft spot in the black hearts of many a Venom fan, young or old. Other songs like \u201cBeggarman\u201d, \u201cLest We Forget\u201d and \u201cSin\u201d are fluid pieces of a larger puzzle that have more memorable and interesting riffs than pedestrian rehashes. Completing the musical picture are some slower, unexpected passages here and there that are not only perfectly-placed but timed accordingly to not wear out a welcome or simply take up empty space. As a whole, the original Venom sound is, at the very least, altered and more modernized to pretty much blend in with the modern thrash bands of today. The crisp, think production doesn\u2019t necessarily deny a lineage as much as it showcases a different Venom that, for this record, manages to encapsulate a resonating and palpable sound. \n\nI\u2019ve always said that Venom lost that familiar edge once they learned to effectively play their instruments. At worst it\u2019s an insult of high order; at best it\u2019s a testament to the fact that even a minimalistic band with borderline talent can destroy and conquer the masses with honest, integral music that influenced a virtual planet of musicians from 1980 onward. The band has certainly capitulated on its instrumental prowess of late, and this album has some really fine moments of old school heavy metal, even if the NWOBHM influence has long been washed away. Cronos sounds more lyrically-inspired than on Hell or Metal Black and while the original danger associated with Venom might be muffled the anger and volatility are still ever present.\n\nOverall this is one of the better post-original lineup releases since Prime Evil. I\u2019m once more glad to be proven wrong, especially concerning a band that has, quite literally, molded and shaped my life in large ways\u2026and damn them to Hell for that! \n\n(Originally written for www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\nThe original Black Metal Brits took a 3 year hiatus after 1997's \"Cast In Stone\", but returned in 2000 with \"Resurrection\", an unfortunate and overused title. It stands as a minor oddball in the Venom discography for many reasons. It's the first album without Abaddon on drums. Many songs have \"filler\" written all over therm, but yet are still pretty decent. It has arguably the most polished sound of any of their albums. But, is it any good overall?\n\nCronos and Mantas return for this set, and they're as good as ever. Cronos' bass is heavy as fuck on this record, and his voice is just as equally strong. Mantas in back in the saddle with loud riffing and shredding, though both men and their instruments lose a bit of that old, raw Venom charm due to the rather clean and loud sound of the songs, allowing for a minor generic feel to seep through. Replacing Abaddon is Cronos' younger brother Antton. While he doesn't have that manic, \"fuck the world\" speed and zaniness Abaddon had, he still more than makes up for with his own punishing brand of skull-smashing heaviness. A fine replacement.\n\nThe songs, all 14 of 'em (fuck me, is that enough?), are varied but similar. As I mentioned earlier, a good number of the songs are very fillerish, but many still have little quirks to them that make them better than they should be. Numbers like \"Firelight\" or Disbeliever\" are just okay. Not bad, but okay. Little numbers like \"Loaded\" or \"Man, Myth And Magic\" remain memorable thanks to surprising melody and speed, while others like closer \"Leviathan\" are blessed with a crushing midpace. The best numbers overall include: the title track, which, while heavy as fuck and catchy, just sort of hangs together on a single riff (at least it's a good riff); \"Pain\", a semi-fast, hate-filled crusher with more killer riffing and guitarwork; \"Pandemonium\", a fast chugger with an unforgettable riff; and lastly, the fucking awesome \"Vengeance\", which I think ranks as a Venom classic with it's hateful Mantas lyrics and whirlwind guitars and Cronos' pissed-off roaring and crushing bass.\n\nOverall, the lack of Abaddon, clean production and overuse of fillers may put some off, but \"Resurrection\" still ranks as certainly one of the band better efforts.\n",
        "\nIt had been over 20 years since Venom's seminal, ground-breaking metal album \"Black Metal\" back in grand ol' 1982. In 2006, Venom decided to celebrate the anniversary of their achievement with the oddly-titled \"Metal Black\", a follow-up/sidequel/remake/sequel/WTF to the original classic. And boy oh boy is it...okay.\n\n\"Metal Black\" suffers a great deal from fillers. Well over half of the 13 songs on this album are almost totally forgettable. \"Darkest Realm\"? Forgettable. \"Blessed Dead\"? Filler. \"Sleep When I'm Dead\"? No thanks. However, on the other side of the spectrum, the good songs on here are actually really fucking good. The opening trilogy of songs start this sucker off with a bang. Opener \"Antechrist\", humorously misspelled, is fucking fast, with a good chorus, pounding drumming and squealing guitars. The short \"Burn In Hell\" has surprisingly melodic vocals from Cronos and more strong drumming. Next is \"Death And Dying\", a dark, heavy rocker with a vicious riff and more dastardly vox from Cronos. But, for the most part afterwords, the album takes a detour straight to filler hell. But a few other salvageable numbers include the repetitive but somehow still good \"Good Day To Die\", the thundering \"Hours Of Darkness\" with another memorable riff similar to the one from \"Death And Dying\", and arguably the album's highlight, \"Assassin\", with its brutal speed and riffing, memorable vocals, killer drums, super-heavy bass and strong guitarwork.\n\nThe album has a very raw feel, akin to the band's earlier works but with a modern edge. This gives \"Metal Lack\" probably the best sound of Venom's more recent works, though some may be put off at first by the sometimes hard-to-hear production. The band, mostly, is pretty damn good here. Cronos' voice is great; gravelly and evil, as it always should be, though on this particular album he manages to get in touch with his inner melody too. His bass is a bit more run-of-the-mill, but still heavy and at least noticeable. His brother Antton is the highlight here. His drumming sounds fucking great raw like this; he's fast and just damn good here. Easily the weakest link here is Mike \"Mykus\" Hickey on guitars. He only occasionally stands out during solos and the like, but never really wows. He depends too much on making the guitar's sound too loud and squealing, lacking the shredding power of Rage on \"Hell\" or the speed and creativity of Mantas before him.\n\nOverall, \"Metal Black\" suffers from uninspired guitars and way too many fillers, but the genuinely raw production, solid drumming and the few really good songs help to heal the wounds.\n",
        "\nI could really go either way on most of Venom's output since the 'revival phase' that started with their 1997 comeback Cast in Stone. A few of the newer records, like Metal Black and Resurrection were not half-bad, but I'll be damned if I can remember anything from the last effort Hell. Unfortunately, Fallen Angels ends up in that same trough of unmemorable writing and is unlikely to capture the same attention or mete out the same inspiration that their filth-ridden masterpieces Welcome to Hell (1981) and Black Metal (1982) once enjoyed; two of the most influential 'extreme' metal records to date in the entire medium, and two personal favorites. I remained an addict to Venom's shifting landscape even through the oft maligned 80s records with Tony Dolan, but in 2011, I'm afraid the writing has become quite flat.\n\nTo a degree, Venom is still attempting to sound like the trio most know and love (or hate) when reflecting back on their halcyon days, even if this is not at all that same trio. Cronos is still using his grimy, hoarse vocal tones and the riffs remain total throwbacks to a mixture of primal speed/thrash and NWOBHM. The 'bulldozer' bass tone on the album is quite large, similar to a Mot\u00f6rhead level, but it never really weaves in anything interesting, merely coasts along as some copious substrate to support the bland guitar riffing. The newer members Rage and Dante do their jobs, but that's not saying much, since the note progressions are all pretty thoughtless or obvious and it doesn't seem like a lot of effort was placed in them. Songs like \"Nemesis\" and \"Pedal to the Metal\" barrel along with a youthful hostility, and to be sure, Venom was all about the crass simplicity and blasphemy of its compositions, and yet none of these really stick to the ears. In fact, without the presence of Cronos' sinister frontmanship, Fallen Angels would feel like any random bar band jamming out some old school metal songs...\n\nAnd that is just not good enough for this old timer. To be fair, Venom does much to mix up the pacing of the record, so it's not some monotonous slog through the same territory. They unleash a slower, groovier style in \"Hammerhead\", which sounds like meaty mosh-thrash but has not a single interesting riff. An acceptable acoustic interlude in \"Lest We Forget\". They go for lengthier atmosphere in the titular \"Fallen Angels\", and yet once the metal thunder arrives, the guitars are just as vapid and forgettable as anywhere else, despite this being one of the few points where the bass surges along craftily in a vat of distortion. A couple of the later pieces like \"Sin\", \"Death by the Name\" or \"Beggarman\" border on having some spry, fun patterns of punishment, but even here they feel only marginally more exciting than on the rest of the record.\n\nThe album has a loud, pumping production, and Cronos does his best to create those diabolical lyrical embellishments he is so renowned for, but Fallen Angels is ultimately not going to force a sweat on any host of seraphs, much less clip their wings. If you're simply in the mood for hearing this veteran's drawl over commonplace, dime a dozen riffs, then I'd hardly call the album a disaster, but it not once offers any reason to choose it over anything the band unleashed from about 1981-1992, nor even a few of their other post-comeback albums. In fact, this might just be the least interesting and/or amusing Venom record to date.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nLegend has it that the first Venom album has such a legendary lo-fi production and raw performances because the band thought they'd been booked in to produce a demo for the album, not the album itself. Whether or not this was true, the muddy souns quality on the release transformed Venom's music from a series of fast-paced NWOBHM tracks highly reminiscent of Motorhead to an altogether stranger album, an album which hinted at the sonic possibilities of the harsh soundscapes unlocked by the band.\n\nIn particular, the title track from this album is a stunning prototype for thrash metal; what Venom attained with their guitar sound through the muzzy production would be reproduced in crystal clarity by Slayer in their early material. Cronos' basswork is often lost in the mix, though where it does emerge from the fog it's raw and powerful, though not as technically accomplished as Motorhead's Lemmy (whose style is clearly an inspiration here). Abaddon's drums are a howling cacophony at the back of the mix, keeping the band driving away at what was at the time a furious pace. Where the band most resemble the black metal bands that would arise later is in the lyrical content, which embraces openly scatological and blasphemous content to an extent hitherto unseen in a metal act; musically, however, the band more closely resemble the early thrash acts who would apply increasing levels of technical proficiency to the raucous, wild sound the band describe here.\n\nThat said, though it's undeniably influential the album isn't perfect. Whilst there are compelling aesthetic reasons why the lo-fi production really does work for this material, some listeners will just find it irritating - personally, I don't, but I can see how some people might have issues with it. Secondly, the songwriting isn't at a consistently high quality. In particular, In League With Satan - whilst it has some hilariously rude lyrics - is a plodding dirge of a song, an attempt to create a simplistic piece that audience members at gigs can clap and sing along to which doesn't quite fit the denser and more interesting material surrounding it.\n\nStill, these are niggles; on the whole, Welcome to Hell is a fascinating debut for a band with a distinctive sound straight out of the gate. I'd particularly recommend it for fans of the material Motorhead were producing around this time who aren't bothered by raw production values.\n",
        "\nTo quote the mighty Cronos: \"BWAA-HAHAHAHA!\"\n\n2008's \"Hell\" may be not an instant Venom classic, but the devil be damned if it still ain't one hell of a ride. The overall sound and production is a bit cleaner than their previous effort, 2006's very slightly superior \"Metal Black\", but not quite as polished as say \"Resurrection\". The listener is either gonna love or hate this; personally, it doesn't bother me since most of what's presented here is total kickassery! Cronos' vox are just as mean as ever, maybe even more than so than before that the youthfulness has left his voice, allowing for a more evil, gravelly performance. His bass too is quite good, but again not quite as crushing as his work on \"Metal Black\". Still, a number of beastly riffs are unchained here, annihilating the listener with catchiness and the band's trademark rawness.\n\nJoining Cronos on this ride to \"Hell\" are his younger brother Antton Lant on drums and \"Rage\" on guitars. Antton totally kicks here, but yet again is just not quite as good as his work on the group's last album. Still, he pounds those skins into molten mush, rattling your mortal brain in the process. Rage, on the other hand, is arguably the highlight of this album. This guy fucking shreds like NOBODY'S business; definitely 666 steps above many of the band's previous guitarists, save maybe for the mighty Mantas. \n\nMy main gripe with this album is the songs themselves, and how many there are. Seriously, thirteen? I mean that may not be a lot to some, but a metal album with over 10 or 11 songs tends to get repetitive and lost in itself, allowing for those dreaded fillers. That's what happened, to a somewhat worse extent, on \"Metal Black\", and occurs here too. \"Dirge/Awakening\" is an instrumental piece that ends the album, and could have easily have been excised due to its short length and lack of any really memorable moments, save for its speaker-blasting opening. Other songs like \"Blood Sky\", \"Stab U In The Back\", or the silly \"Kill The Music\" just sort of make the album longer. They don't particularly stand out and are forgotten almost right after the initial listen. Some songs however more than make up for the few shortcomings. \"Straight To Hell\" is one HELL (I'm sorry) of an opener, with Cronos' growling shouts and cruel laughing; Rage's amazing shredding are a highlight of this fist-pumping rocker as well. The awesome \"Evilution Devilution\" comes too late in the album in my opinion; very memorable thanks to thumping guitarwork and a simple but catchy chorus. \"Hand Of God\" is another thundering number, with some of Antton's strongest drumming and a vicious riff. But arguably the highlight here is the apocalyptic title track. Not only is it memorable thanks to a PAIR of catchy, galloping riffs, but the whole crew shines here. Cronos' bass is positively soul-smashing, Rage's brutal guitar shreds flesh, and Antton's drumming will turn your skull to dust, all with \"Evil Perfection\".\n\nOverall, the album comes a bit short thanks some repetitivity and an occasionally too-clean sound, but the current trio still smashes mortal souls here with heaviness, catchiness and raw, evil power in a number of the tracks.\n",
        "\n\"\u2026we're possessed by all that is evil, the death of you God we demand...\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a good drummer. He\u2019s not particularly a good singer, but as a whole, we are a brick\u2026\u201d are Abaddon\u2019s words during the band\u2019s jovial interview on the Ultimate Revenge concert video, visual evidence to one of the most fabled shows grown by the metal underground, a show many of us have seen at least a few times. One or two may even be in the crowd giving the cameraman the finger (I\u2019m the black bum in the skullcap). As the drummer fights for a whisky bottle, his unsweetened confession paints a simple brass tacks picture of the band that wasn\u2019t exactly a secret. \n\nAt that time in '85, it wasn\u2019t odd that someone hadn\u2019t heard (of) Venom even while three or four of the band\u2019s slabs were scaring parents in the sparse places they could be found. The scene was still but a small landmass undiscovered by many, yet it was larger than the dinky island it was in \u201981. Despite a fairly lengthy discography, the three were still fresh faces to the masses that read Hit Parader, and new listeners to Venom could do two things: welcome comparisons and contrasts to other bands or not even give a damn. \n\nNow the album\u2019s been out for 36 years, practically an eternity as far as metal releases go, and like the thing or not, it\u2019s regarded as an ivy-covered landmark. Unless you\u2019re just discovering metal, anyone who ever wanted to hear it has had plenty of time, yet for some reason I still hear a lot of the obvious when it\u2019s brought up nowadays for review or in casual conversation.\n\nDo we need Nancy Drew to tell us the musicianship on Welcome to Hell is a sweat-soaked nightmare of the Julliard School of Music? Do we need Scooby and the Mystery Machine to tell us metal has progressed into something much more ferocious than what\u2019s on Venom\u2019s debut? Maybe we should hire Magnum P.I. to uncover that the trio had been greatly impressed by countrymates Motorhead and a slew of punk bands, and even though the band\u2019s din is ritually described as the nullius filius of that time\u2019s most ill mannered music, people are still compelled to not only compare it to Maiden, Sabbath, Accept, Angel Witch, Saxon, Krokus, and Judas Priest, but boldly announce it sounds nothing like those bands. Old hat. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about Neat Records a bit. When Neat released the In League with Satan 7\u201d, the company was hardly the long-lived bastion of music, but a small British indie label just trying to put out some tunes. As far as 7\u201d records go, the first format the label used, the Venom 7\u201d was its eighth. As far as full-lengthers go, Welcome to Hell would be its second, preceded only by Raven\u2019s Rock Until You Drop. The chances the trio really wanted their debut to sound like it was recorded in ditch water is conceivable, but it\u2019s even more fathomable Dave Wood had about two hundred pounds in his pocket to throw Keith Nichol for the production. On top of that, production equipment then to now is like the Ford Pinto to a 2005 Jaguar, so to complain about the mix is to proclaim something undisputed. If Venom were on EMI/Harvest like Maiden, or even a label like Attic, things probably would\u2019ve been a little rosier in that department, but this is what they/we got, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \n\n\u201c\u2026all hell rejoices at the child that she will bear, and Satan\u2019s only son shall be the world\u2019s despair\u2026\u201d\n\nBut one can\u2019t write a review without delving into some background banality. Welcome to Hell would see pitch of night in the winter of 1981 \u2013 low-budget devil-headed pentagram cover, eleven odes to evil, \u2018ol horn head and other topics most unsavory, that nifty blasphemous quote on the back cover that was a warning for all parents to grab their kids and run, and the three of them standing in some sand with hatchets...unkempt, under produced, malevolent, frightening, but not yet timeless. It was a gateway to a sound\u2026probably the first true gritty \u2018underground\u2019 sound\u2026that would slowly storm the world and hold it enraptured to this day. Aside from being Neat\u2019s biggest band ever, Venom would become one of the most influential bands metal would hear since Sabbath tolled during a rainstorm in \u201870, Judas Priest parodied Coca-cola in \u201974, everyone\u2019s lawn died around Motorhead in \u201977, and Maiden released its most boring Eddie album cover in \u201980. The fact that no Maiden/standard nwobhm influence whatsoever inches out of this lp makes it even more the marvel. Is it a likable album? Obviously. Is someone kinda nuts for considering it one of the best? Probably, and no. It\u2019s got the finesse of a rusty backhoe, the professionalism of an early \u201870s pro wrestler named Crusher, and the depth of the 2003 Detroit Tigers pitching staff. \n\nBut it\u2019s simultaneously terrifying and infectious. It has dark-eyed, Richard Ramirez charisma. It\u2019s boiler room noisy. It has more attitude than twenty nwobhm here today-gone tomorrow dinks put together. In hindsight, what band as early as and besides Venom w(c)ould have plowed aside all the decorations, all the showmanship, and all the elaboration of the pretentious, traditional Euro sound? I'm waiting...just one other band....that's what I thought. \n\nWelcome to Hell is the underground\u2019s savior. Of course, most people would've laughed if that statement was made then.\n\nIn instantly blistering fashion, \u201cSons of Satan\u201d disintegrates the crackling din of vinyl, a tumultuous number that is initially so much like a fiery cannonball in your face it takes you a second or two to recover. Only Helen Keller could miss the Satanic commitment that practically shoots fireworks from the sleeve and the lyrics are no different, but you\u2019d have to wonder about a verse like:\n\n\u201c\u2026put away all your virtues, stop your climbing the walls, \njust sign your name on the paper, we'll have ourselves a ball\u2026\u201d\n\nAre these guys for real? Sure sounds like they mean business, especially bassist/vocalist/centerpiece Cronos whose delivery is condemningly diabolical, yet largely intelligible with an apparent penchant for tongue-in-cheek humor. The title cut is more controlled in its deviltry, parched lungs evincing a rambling tale that goes on to underscore an obscured female-narrated passage\u2026 \u201cand as I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil\u2026\u201d like a soul entering their fiery domain with a prayer on her lips. Tom and Martin of Hellhammer/Celtic Frost would glean inspiration from this particular avant-garde avenue. \u201cSchizo\u201d and \u201cPoison\u201d are two rotten peas in a pod, sharing a pace moderately brisk and a noisily catchy arch perched over a bubbling undercurrent of raw, primeval grimness. This unrelenting lava flow steams around the strange, wavering acoustics of \u201cMayhem With Mercy\u201d, a shimmering ghost island only a few feet in diameter wedged between the two tracks , like hallowed ground on the verge of contagion. \u201cLive Like an Angel (Die Like a Devil)\u201d momentarily leers at this island, curls a cracked lip in disgust, and dismisses it with an agile riff, a jagged, quickly spun chorus and maliciously upbeat determination. \n\nEasily more unforgiving and bitter is side two. \u201cWitching Hour\u201d, perhaps one of their top tracks, breaks the seal of Solomon, tolling midnight as demons cry, breaking hell loose with a rapid, noxious rhythm, near breakaway chorus, and an ebon story that just rolls off Cronos\u2019s diseased tongue. \u201cOne Thousand Days In Sodom\u201d is as merciless as the title implies. A Mantas solo scribbles and squeals over a breaking bass line while the chorus is the song\u2019s taskmaster, yelling its fate while whipping slaves with grumbling riffage. Quickening the stride again is \u201cAngel Dust\u201d, another barbarian at the gates that rips them from hinges with a bursting chorus. Then the fires turn black. With the unholy entrance of \u201cIn League With Satan\u201d the draconian mood ascends to another level. Just when you think this album\u2019s psalms to Hell have already been penned in their purest form, this innocent little ditty comes along to crush them and all other feats of darkness up until that point and some time after\u2026the morose, back masked \u201c\u2026grind bones to dust\u2026\u201d intro, the distorted demon-twined vocals, the droning chorus, lyrics \u201c\u2026kill a newborn baby, tear infant\u2019s flesh\u2026\u201d written with the tears of priests\u2026an acquired taste that will have many gagging before it\u2019s over. Finale \u201cRed Light Fever\u201d is more basic than most of the group\u2019s tracks. Abaddon never deviates from the most basic of drumbeats even during the tune\u2019s moments of pure outburst, a solo that\u2019s foremost white noise while Cronos growls whatever seems to come to mind.\n\nOur underground owes so much to Welcome to Hell. Even if it\u2019s not your cup of tea, there\u2019s no discarding its importance to metal\u2019s heavy-handed development, and every fan of black, death, thrash, and speed metal should raise a goblet in its honor. Indeed it is the heaviest, dirtiest, and most unwholesome album of its day, and the unholy trinity couldn\u2019t have started their reign with a worthier title. \n\nCall me a fanboy if you wish. \n\n\u201c\u2026a thousand days\u2026a thousand years\u2026you\u2019ve lived your life in Hell\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\nVenom, one of those legendary bands from United Kingdom. The most interesting fact about that band is that they have created the word (well, compound word): black metal. Why did I choose to review this album than Black Metal or At War With Satan?? It\u2019s because it features the last album with the original line up from the first era album (last album where they all featured in was Possessed in 95) and after 13 long years, they decided to work together and give us Cast In Stone.\n\nIndeed, the structure and style of the songs haven\u2019t changed, but the only thing different from Possessed and Black Metal is that it\u2019s more violent, more evil, more everything HUH! We begin the album with an evil one, heavy guitar riff with an incredible heavy bass sound, such riffs being mostly all along the album which makes it more violent than \u2018raw\u2019 than the first one. There are some violent fast tracks (Fly of the Hydra is the perfect example) which make the album much more original & polyvalent than the previous, as shown for tracks 6 and 14, made by Abaddon (surely planned for his solo project if anyone's heard it, it's kind of electronic heavy techno) that we can hear a big different. He gives us some tribal drum at the beginning with weird ambient in the middle of the sound, something we've never heard from the other album. \n\nSwarm, interesting song and original too with some Egyptian whispering behind a little electronic drum beat mixed with some winds and the song ends with an incredible solitary swell of ambience which gives the album that punch of darkness. The drumming style of Abaddon hasn't changed over the years and the same goes for Cronos with his vocals, why change something which already works well.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve chosen this album than the other, all the songs give us something new and original than the previous and even the new ones. All tracks on this album deserve a few listens because they are all different, we can\u2019t say \u2018hey that track almost has the same riff as their song X\u2019. \n\nTrack to listen: ALL.\n",
        "\nIn early 80\u2019s Newcastle, three Geordies were getting sick of the tame rock and metal music that was flooding England. So many bands came close to evil perfection: Black Sabbath had the satanic subject matter but lacked endorsement of devil worship, Judas Priest and KISS had the outfits and stage shows but lacked the sonic assault, and Motorhead had the bulldozering aggression but were missing the over-the-top psycho-drama in concert. Venom couldn\u2019t name one of their heroes that they really could call a \u201chero.\u201d\n\nBeing a music studio employee, vocalist/bassist Conrad \u201cCronos\u201d Lant was also fed up with the NWOBHM movement. He continually saw bands coming into the studio looking to sound like the next Saxon, instead of attempting something original. It was frustrating to see Raven, Tygers of Pan Tang, and Samson hailed as the next big thing while Venom was ignored. He began to conclude that \u201cheavy metal is for the chicks\u201d by the time the press was labeling Foreigner a metal band.\n\nThe concept of Venom was the ultimate rebellion within metal: Black Metal. Although the eponymous anthem to the genre was still unwritten, that\u2019s what \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d was in sound and spirit. It was a style of music with minimal resemblance to the Scandinavian black metal scene yet to come, but it was definitely a prototype and hugely influential. What it sounded like was a fusion of heavy metal and punk rock, a similar sound to Motorhead but with much rougher production and an evil atmosphere. Despite popular belief, the raw sound was intentional; earlier for the singles, Cronos almost lost his job switching the tapes that were going to be distributed for ones with worse quality. Venom were the first metal band to embrace poor recording for the sake of heaviness and inaccessibility.\n\nHere\u2019s the album: a compilation of demos, gritty recordings of songs about sex, drugs and the devil\u2026.most importantly, the devil. Cronos once said that Ozzy Osbourne got it all wrong when he cried out to God for help in Black Sabbath\u2019s eponymous opener; why tell the story through the eyes of the righteous man, when you could tell it through the eyes of a demon? It\u2019s much more fun to play the bad guy. And when this album opens up with \u201cSons of Satan,\u201d you know that the Legions are the bad guys.\n\nTrack after track, anyone not familiar with this music will struggle to make out the sloppy riffs. Guitarist Jeff \u201cMantas\u201d Dunn screws up a lot, and he doesn\u2019t make much of an effort to hide it. Tony \u201cAbaddon\u201d Bray\u2019s drumming is simple, but the timing is far from the machine-gun perfection most modern metal drummers embrace. The focus is on energy, excitement, and catchy licks. Atmosphere is pivotal as well, with evil effects placed over Cronos\u2019s voice on tracks like \u201cIn League With Satan.\u201d Speaking of which, bassist/singer Cronos makes no attempt to sing notes, but instead snarls with a raspy voice, the most distinct and original voice in metal since Ozzy and Lemmy. The texture is perfect, and if you can acquire a taste for the strong stuff, it is quite palatable. We hear it throughout classics like \u201cPoison\u201d and \u201cWitching Hour,\u201d and it\u2019s what keeps Venom feeling vivaciously sinister.\n\nSpeed plays a pivotal role in \u201cWelcome to Hell,\u201d and a lot of the perceived fastness comes down to the audible exhaustion as the band sweats everything they got into their instruments, trying to keep pace. \u201cAngel Dust\u201d is the fastest song on here, and it\u2019s written to be catchy and fun in addition to evil. That\u2019s one quality of the music that is centrally important; Venom are not trying to be a walking horror show, but more like a horror/comedy at times. Even when things get slow and dark, like on \u201cIn League With Satan,\u201d the groove compels any metalhead to feel like marching along to the beat as he drinks the juice of women, and kills the newborn baby. It\u2019s a role-playing fantasy, with the goal to tell intriguing narratives rather than propagate any sort of philosophy.\n\nThe closing song is the epitome of everything this album, and this band, stand for: Red Light Fever. It mixes humor with sinful lust, all in a package of rusty nails. It also has one of my favorite\u2026guitar solos\u2026of all time. For one minute and forty two seconds, we hear the sound of Mantas plugging his guitar into a bass amplifier and making a racket while Cronos screams indecipherable, misogynistic remarks at a whore. I can hear something about \u201cten inches,\u201d but the rest is mostly a long-lost mystery. And that\u2019s what I love about old Venom albums; they\u2019re loaded with lost gems. You listen to a record like this and you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s actually there and what is just your imagination filling in the blanks. A lot of the riffs are so muffled and obscure, I know I\u2019m throwing in and omitting notes when I try to replicate them\u2026but isn\u2019t it interesting that it means everybody will hear something different when they listen to \u201cWelcome to Hell?\u201d\n\nWell, if you hear it and rate it and don\u2019t care for it, perhaps that\u2019s what happened. Listen again and fill in the blanks better.\n",
        "\nYou can write Venom's shock and schlock tactics off at your own risk, but there is simply no denying how raw and filthy the band's sound was in an era which was still reeling from the glam and prog rock of the 70s. Combined with a kick ass stage show and heaps of blasphemy, there was no way Cronos and crew were not going to make some ripples in a stagnant environment which was in the process of exploding with ideas. Maiden might have written about evil, but Venom WAS evil.\n\nSo why, then, does Welcome to Hell still stand so strong after nearly 30 years of increased brutality, studio wizardry and entire new genres of metal music? Because if you grasp the branches, follow them down the trunk to the roots, and then pull out those roots from the Earth, you will always arrive at the same place: Venom. So why not tap the source for some inspiration? Though it lacks the overdubs, snarls and grunts of modern extremity, Welcome to Hell still sounds excellent to these ears. Distorted bass, punk as fuck, raging rock rhythms on the drum and guitars that, frankly, sound like they are coming from someone who just learned to play the week before...and that's the appeal! Welcome to Hell is grunge, it is NWOBHM, it is black and death and thrash metal, before any of them.\n\nIt is impossible for me not to get wrapped up in nostalgia for this record, which is one non stop hard rocking beast after the next. \"Sons of Satan\" rivals Lemmy and his boys in the pure filth department, this is full on hellish roadkill burn. The title track reigns it back in with a classic riff, that...well...listen to the majority of speed, thrash and power metal bands of the past few decades. You will find this riff on most of their albums. \"Schitzo\" is good drinking, fucking and fighting metal after a hard day's work at the textile mill. \"Mayhem with Mercy\" is a nice acoustic tease for the brawny \"Poison\" to follow, and beat you with its treacherous fist.\n\n'She's mammy's little virgin,\nHer daddy's all in pride,\nBut she welcomed me with opened legs,\nKept me satisfied.'\n\nA timeless anthem of misogyny? In 1981, that was just good fun. \"Live Like an Angel, Die Like a Devil\" is a roiling, noisy mass of black hysteria, with Cronos almost losing his voice in his crumbling cracker vocals. \"Witching Hour\" is rugged and raw, and one of my personal faves on this album, as if I could pick one, but listen to those noisy drums...what a racket! And it does not end there, with \"1000 Days in Sodom\" and the fist fighting \"Angel Dust\". \"In League With Satan\" still sounds brilliant, dark and troubled even after albums like Reign in Blood and In the Nightside Eclipse have come into existence. And the album saves one of its best for last, the spiteful \"Red Light District\". That is, unless you have the fantastic bonus tracks \"In Nomine Satanas\" and \"Burstin' Out\", both of which are great.\n\nWelcome to Hell was a vortex of creativity that spawned countless impersonations. This is pretty much where it all came to a head...the theatrical misanthropy of black metal taking its queues from KISS and running with it as far as possible. Venom has always been controversial and polarizing, but they opened their career with two of the best metal albums in the history of this, or any genre.\n\nHighlights: none of them. all of them.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nA very fucking rare masterpiece, which costs up to over 100 bucks, stands here to be reviewed: 10 Venom tracks that must be heard, at least one time, by every fan of the band.\n\nI split the album in two: a part with the experimental tracks; the other, with the more traditional ones. The experimental one has keyboards, samples (\"Cursed\") and even industrial effects (thanks to Abbadon and V.X.S. - as you can hear in \"Need to kill\"). Spoken voices and cheesy clean guitars are not excluded (\"Clarisse\"). A transition track can be found: \"Black Legions\", which has a background noise (probably people), during Dolan's bass solo. The lyrical approach is very diverse, singing about pyramids, Terminator and a woman (?). Don't be disappointed! The satanic lyrics are not abandoned.\n\nReviewing the \"traditional\" ones, I must say that this is also a diverse one, but you can still pick the best cuts easily. \"Wolverine\", for me, is the best on the album, being intense, fast, thrash\u2013y and well executed. It has everything you want from Venom (Cronos just couldn't handle the song!!!). Second place is received by \"Kissing the Beast\", although this is just a shadow of \"Wolverine\". The rest of the album is not an attempt to overdue \"Wolverine\": it has a charm of its own, from the anthem\u2013ic lyrics of \"Riddle of Steel\", the more melodious \"Crucified\", to the more average, but still good tracks \"Shadow King\" and \"I'm Paralyzed\".\n\nThe musicianship is strong, but a tension between the band members exists. Mantas did his best on guitars and, with the assistance of Steve White, they did a great job, pulling off riffs and solos memorable and original, while retaining the Venom sound. Dolan outdid his vocal performance from \"Prime Evil\" and still manage to pull off some good bass solos and lines. I'm more impressed of how Abbadon managed to improve his skills, even doing blast beats, and, together with V.X.S., manage to do a great job on \"Need To Kill\", a Terminator-fan song, which has a drums-samples duo, that adds a little chilly atmosphere, although Darkthrone and Immortal manage to outdo it the same year in their own style.\n\nFinally, I want to say that THIS was the last original Venom album ever to surface. Mantas left to pursue his martial arts dreams, having already a martial arts gym; Dolan entered the big and small screens, both disillusioned by the greedy Abbadon and the band's manager that kept most of the money for them selves. It was 1993 and a new and refreshing wave of black metal bands (although I don't consider Venom as a former/present black metal band). From now onwards, Venom will reunite and disband for about 3 times (1995 - 2002, 2005), before the final reunion from 2005. Things will never be the same again.\n",
        "\nFirst I want to say that I am huge fan of Venom, and I know that back to the classic days they never were musically too talented group - especially their live performances were abysmal in the traditional terms of musicianship. Anyway, their brutal, primitive sound contained violence and energy that many bands haven't got. And this could especially be seen on their not too complex live albums... You know, for example in \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\" part of the strange charm of album comes from the rough sound.\n\nBut Official Bootleg is something abysmal, and it really has not any charm. I first time heard this album when I bought an old vinyl release with very cheap price. The sound was terrible and I thought it was because the LP was old and scratched. But then I heard the CD version of this stuff, and oh my god, it was even worse since scratches and interference did not hide the terrible performance and bad sound quality of this album. Guitars are out of tune, bass guitar is out of tune, even Abaddon's drums are out of tune and everything is badly mixed. It's actually very hard to hear what the band are playing, since the production is horrible. And anyway, the band plays quite badly. Cronos sings badly, his voice has not power it should have and he loses the little power of his vocals smoothly during the show. Abaddon was never a good drummer, but now he plays far too badly. Mantas plays badly, out of tempo and he's playing the riffs all the time wrong. Cronos doesn't play his bass at all, so this album lacks a lot in the low register of the sound.\n\nSet list is quite okay, including the traditional Venom trademark songs. Anyway, there are also some less often heard classics, such as \"Leave Me in Hell\" (one of the best on the \"Black Metal\" LP) and \"Seven Gates of Hell\". Anyway, all of these songs were presented on \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\" also with a lot better quality, except \"Seven Gates of Hell\" and \"Stand Up and Be Counted\". The last one is not my favourite, so I am actually just glad it is not on the Venom's classic live album. Lacking of \"Seven Gates of Hell\" is a shame for \"Nachtmusik\" and could save this so called Official Bootleg, but to be honest, it's ruined by bad production and bad perfrormance. So are also every other tracks on this album, maybe excluding \"Welcome to Hell\" and \"Bloodlust\" which sound quite nice.\n\nSo, what you get from the Official Bootleg are two or three bearable played songs, good set list but so bad mixing and performance that you really can't enjoy from this album. I actually wouldn't be surprised if Venom actually intended to make this album so bad and choiced then to release it as Official Bootleg to make some fun about bootlegging industry... I don't know, anyway, even if releasing this was fun for Venom, it certainly is not fun for the listener.\n",
        "\nIt goes without saying that Venom were an incredibly influential band in the development of extreme metal, playing a form of grimy Motorhead-influenced rock n rollish heavy metal crossing over into harsh and gritty thrash/speed metal styles (way ahead of their time) and laying down the groundwork for what would become black metal (even further ahead of their time). Their first three albums are widely regarded as classics and masterpieces, constituting their \"holy trinity\". \"Welcome to Hell\" was the grittiest, sleaziest and filthiest by far, while \"Black Metal\" refined the sound a bit and focused more on Satanic themes, and finally \"At War with Satan\" was their most epic , conceptual and concise effort. After permanently forging their name in metal history, Venom devolved their style a bit for 1985's \"Possessed\", retreading the old grimy sound of their first two albums rather than continuing the progression seen on AWWS. For many this album is seen as mediocre and perhaps even a disappointment, but for those who couldn't get enough of Welcome to Hell/Black Metal it's just what the doctor ordered: catchy, heavy, evil and sleazy songs played by none other than metal legends Venom.\n\nUnlike the sharper, cleaned up sound of At War with Satan, this album brings the production right back down to an uncompromising gritty tone. The mixing and production job is actually even more amateur than on their first two efforts in some regards, showing that these guys really wanted to lay on the filth here. The guitar has a fairy sharp tone with heaps of fuzzy trebly distortion. The riffs as usual alternate between Motorhead-ish rock n rollers, head smashing thrash/speeders and some traditional heavy metal chugging and slightly refined more complex and melodic leads (in contrast to their usual ripping noise solos). Mantas is flyin' solo here, so while leads are going on only the bass is plunking behind them rather than a rhythm guitar holding up the backbone. The drums gallop along to the rockin rhythms and pound in the thrashier sections, doing their job adequately but not outstandingly. The recording on the drums is nice and dull and adds a lot to the primitiveness of the sound. Cronos, the frontman of the group and bassist/singer brings perhaps the most to the table. The guitar and bass are held roughly equally in the mix, so the bass lines are always easily distinguishable. In the faster, thrashier parts he's usually just chugging along, but also bringing in his signature chaotic sliding all over the fretboard. In the more rock n roll style riffs and slow/heavy sections this technique adds all kinds of sleaze to the riffs. The bass fills out the rhythm section perfectly, adding a huge, disgusting, filthy presence to the sound. But that's not all for Cronos, as his vocals are equally integral to Venom's sound, and his lyrics are most excellent. His vocal style is a dirty Lemmy-like grunt or yell (these guys obviously loved Motorhead) and when added to thrash/speed/proto-black metal sound seen here it creates the ultimate in early filth. His delivery is often sinister and satirical sounding, showing that the band were at times tongue-in-cheek. His lyrics and songwriting ability are second to none, creating some incredibly catchy choruses and purveying the image of hell-obsessed drug addled maniacal sex fiends (before black metal groups wore corpsepaint and lit candles they did drugs). Also, \"Possessed\" doesn't completely ignore the epic tendencies of \"At War with Satan\", as can be seen in the more technical and complex tracks \"Wing and a Prayer\" and Mystique\".\n\nWhile \"Possessed\" doesn't quite pack the punch of its predecessors, it's well worth investigating and is certainly an important piece of Venom's legacy, being the last great or even listenable album they ever made. The influence Venom's early output had on the development of metal is astounding, perhaps singlehandedly setting in motion all the primitive thrash and speed metal (such as Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, Teutonic thrashers like Sodom and Destruction, and South American maniacs like Sarcofago) that would inspire the explosion of black and death metal in the late 80s and early 90s. All of Venom's material up to 1985 was untouchable, undeniably influential, classic and truly outstanding. Any fan of gritty extreme metal should be in love with Venom already, so this should be recommended to those who have only heard their earlier material. If you haven't yet heard these guys at all, well I just don't know about you... get this album immediately, or at the very least blast \"Welcome to Hell\" at high volumes while smashing your skull on a concrete wall and smoking PCP or snorting speed. Aaaarrgghhh!!!\n",
        "\nOh Venom... So many different live albums to listen to, and pretty much all of them sound like the Show was taped and recorded in a filthy public toilet rather than at the legendary Hammersmith Odeon. This type of quantity over quality mentality on the part of the band is probably more than enough to frustrate most dedicated fans, but for me, it's a great opportunity to have a good laugh and pick up some new jokes.\n\nI've often said that if Cronos and the boys were to stop playing music, and simply just do shows that consisted entirely of their trademark stage banter, that they'd be multi-millionaires and world famous comedians. The plain fact is that while Venom were rather iffy when it came to their musical coherence, one of their main appeals (at least for me) is the fact that they are the most over the top and ridiculous trio in music. Their super serious yet slightly self deprecating attitude has made even my friends who aren't into heavy music at all to break down laughing and ask for loans of the classic albums. After all, who couldn't break into a fit of laughter hearing Cronos's demented moans at the beginning of Warhead, the list of people deemed as liking \"Good Shit\", Mantas's voice cracking as he tries to interact with the crowd, and the classic shouts of \"C'MON\", and \"make some focking noise\". Great stuff.\n\nFrom a musical standpoint, this album is utter shit. Even for Venom, this was a rough show (especially if you watch some of the videos of tracks omitted from this disk). It's also one of two albums I've ever encountered that were actually painful to listen to through headphones. However, seeing as these two factors actually add to the enjoyment of the album, no points are deducted for this.\n\nI am a little disappointed with the previously mentioned omission of tracks, especially since there was room on the disk for more music, and there was no real reason for their cut (they honestly weren't that much worse than the stuff on here already). I was also disappointed with the lack of a proper booklet, and the all around lack of thought put into the packaging.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a top notch live performance... Why are you listening to Venom? Recommended for fans and people with a good sense of humor, people who already own the video should probably just skip this.\n\nIn the words of Abbadon... I'm not a very good drummer, and he's not a very good singer... but together, we're a fucking brick\".\n",
        "\nDuring their golden age 1980 - 1985 Venom were very innovative and producive band. Four killer albums (well, Possessed was not so killer...), great live album and a flood of excellent singles (as million different versions of course). After that Venom's publishing policy have been slightly different. Every fifth year they release new album full of filler tracks and with very few good ones, and between these albums they are flooding the market with an enormous masses of compilations of their classics. One of those, \"The Seven Gates of Hell - Singles 1980-1985\" is, as the title suggests, a collection of their old singles.\n\nDuring their golden years, Venom's best recordings almost always were singles. \"In League with Satan\", \"In Nomine Satanas\", \"Bloodlust\", \"Nightmare\", \"Witching Hour\"... All of them are great proto black metal classics and all of them were singles by Venom. So one could think that it was a good idea to compile these classic singles into one compilation. Well, probably it is quite good idea, but this compilation, as a compilation, sucks.\n\nFirst of all, it really is not a best of compilation - there are very good tracks but also few fillers and even bad songs, and this lacks some of Venom's best pieces, such as \"Black Metal\", \"Welcome to Hell\" and \"Don't Burn the Witch\". Second, this is not very well composed compilation: there's actually nothing bonus material (all songs have been released before on re-releases of the four first albums of Venom). And the production on this album almost ruins it... No one of tracks are remastered or something like that, but at least on my double LP (CD version maybe has not same problem, I have no idea...) there's not much bass sound, and the sound is very treble. And I have also those singles as originals, so I know they really shouldn't sound like that! Through the compilation there can be heard annoying treble sound whistling over everything.\n\nLooking in to the tracklist, there are many great songs. There's also quite much diversity in the songs. \"In League with Satan\" is slow, hypnotic track with creepy growls by Venom frontman Cronos and has very scary atmosphere (I suffer from panic disorder, and this song makes me always to have panic attack). \"Die Hard\" is more punkish and rocking track with very good and almost groovy riff, with nice but sadly way too short guitar solo by Mantas. \"Warhead\" is almost hilariously brutal song with deathly growls at it's beginning. And when Cronos reaches the mid place of the song and he roars the lyrics about nuclear warfare you can almost feel how nuclear missiles are exploding... ;) This song is quite slow one and has some interesting drumming my Abaddon. \"Nightmare\" is one of the greatest Venom tracks, Cronos sings with melody probably for first time. This song is full of great riffs and also the lyrics are very atmospheric.\n\nBut there are also a lot of bad songs... Venom have never been musically too talented group, and many of their single B-sides are just fillers. Especially \"Satanachist\" is annoying, as well as is \"F.O.A.D.\" which is a song that really could fuck off and die. \"Dead of the Night\" is another annoying filler, and \"Manitou\" just a desperate attempt to make another \"Warhead\". Very annoying piece.\n\nSo... This is not a great album, but it's not bad. It has lot of good songs, though it suffers from bad mixing. If you already own some Venom compilation (which probably includes the best of these tracks), or re-releases of Venom classics which surely have all these tracks and much more, this is useless for you. Die Hard fans like me may anyway find this interesting, if you already have for example originals of their old albums and you want also get familiar with some of their excellent singles.\n\nAt least the double LP has also quite interesting history section about tracks on this album. Unbelievable that this kind of band was once so fucking popular... Well, this is black fucking metal!\n",
        "\nThroughout the 40-ish years of the genre's existence, there have been metal albums which reek of promise and potential, brilliant musicianship and complex compositional qualities, lyrics of social, political, personal or sacrilegious significance.\n\n'Black Metal' is not one of those albums.\n\nIt shares none of those qualities. It simply exists to kick your ass and then do lines off that kicked ass while popping shots of whiskey, inhaling the most rancid cigarettes imaginable and sodomizing your old lady. Though the album is more cohesive from a production standpoint than Venom's legendary debut Welcome to Hell, it loses none of the grisly edge and raw meat riffing of its predecessor. Faux Satanic lyrics highlight tales of sexual blasphemy and necromantic ritual while disgustipated guitar riffs grind over the thundering of Abaddon. Cronos doesn't quite sing his lyrics...it's more than he kind of spits and growls them. Keep in mind, this was a period in which the overwhelming majority of early metal bands employed vocalists who sounded as if they were competing for testicular constriction. Some rotten bloke spewing his mid-ranged, almost conversational barks over a discharge of brutal and simple riffing was simply unheard of.\n\nIt all adds to the charm. \"Black Metal\" tips off the album with one of the band's most infectious speed metal riffs, gritty and catchy (the kind of riff that would inspire bands like Possessed, Razor, Slayer and Indestroy). It also features one of the band's infamous lyrics 'Lay down your soul to the gods rock `n' roll'. \"To Hell and Back\" is a mid-paced number notable for Cronos laying down the thick distorted bass, and Mantas's mind numbling, senseless shredding (also a huge influence on many thrash and death metal bands). \"Buried Alive\" opens with a hilarious sample of a last rite before slowly building some creepy mystique and busting out some gory 'eavy metal. \"Raise the Dead\" is just foul, Crono's vocals splattered across a kick ass yet traditional NWOBHM riff.\n\n\"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust\nIf God won't have me, then the Devil must!\"\n\n\"Teacher's Pet\" is like the X-rated version of Van Halen's \"Hot For Teacher\", done up Venom class. \"Leave Me in Hell\" burns with a molten hot metal lick, a doomed ride on the river Styx with Cronos as your ferryman. \"Sacrifice\" is another scorcher with its grim Satanic ritual lyrics and a killer bridge before the choral breakdown.\n\n\"Hooded figures, clouded skies\nfires burn within their eyes\npentagram with baphomet midnight strikes\ngoat of menders lifts his head\nsummons up the living dead\nvirgin flesh lies tied and bound\nhail satanas\"\n\n\"Heaven's on Fire\" has a balls out bluesy twist to its speedy fare, pumping bass and fuzzy distortion which amazingly defies age. Two more classics round out this set, the diabolic \"Countess Bathory\" and haunted house crowd pleaser \"Don't Burn the Witch\". Both fucking rule, in particular the verse riffing in the latter.\n\nI've already mentioned that the album has a timeless vibe to it. Perhaps this is due to the fact it sounds like the band is playing it live from your basement while you sit above sipping tea and hiding behind your cross, all the while fantasizing about orgies in goats blood and sexual climax beneath the full moon. It isn't just the name of this album which inspired an entire sub-genre of the medium; it's the carnal and unswerving attitude of the band to deliver schlock rock in its most sinister scenario amidst some of the most outrageous riffs you were likely to hear in 1982. Venom did not give a fuck, and look where and wot it got them?\n\nInfamy.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe sheer amount of Venom \"Album's\" churned out by various record labels in recent years has made it very difficult to figure out what's a good buy and what's not. Luckily, for every nonsense compilation album that appears on the shelves, we get a proper live album, and this one is as good, if not slightly better, than many of the others I've heard. \n\nThat said, and it doesn't even have Cronos playing bass!\n\nNope, this live collection comes from an often overlooked and misunderstood point in Venom's Career, where Cronos was gone, and Dolan was in. In the vocal department, though different in terms of style, Dolan had very little problem tackling classics like \"Welcome to Hell', and \"Buried Alive\". In the bass playing department, however, Dolan's a little too talented for his own good, and a little lacking in the brute force charm of the \"bulldozing\" style of his predecessor. \n\n\nThe drum's sound surprisingly competent, though still unmistakably Abbadon (fast and sloppy). The guitars are both audible, and Mantas continues to impress with his inventive and schizophrenic riffing. The performance, as par with Venom, is often sloppy, but then again, it wouldn't be as much fun and exciting if the performances were top notch and super technical. When it comes to Venom, a little musical sloppiness is always to be expected.\n\nNow for the negatives, the track listing's a little spotty, there's about a 50-50 ratio of Cronos to Dolan material, and it doesn't always Gel particularly well. The early black metal sometimes clashes with the more \"Exodus\" sounding stuff from the Dolan period. The track listing for the early material is also a little too \"Greatest Hits\" for my taste, with too much emphasis on singles and not enough on the hidden gems of the back catalog one expects to hear on a live album. Also, they cut out the long intro from Welcome to Hell, which is something I expect to hear with my Venom live album (it always ends up being accidentally hilarious). But these are minor complaints, and don't detract terribly from the album\n\nThe major complaint I have with this album is the jumpy sound quality. The crowd is often inaudible, and the quality of sound from track to track varies noticeably. This sort of low budget production can be appealing, but I prefer my bootleg albums to be at least consistent in their sound crapiness. It becomes a burden to have to strain to hear one track and then have to quickly turn the speakers down because the next is inhumanly loud. Also, the fade outs are done badly, very abrupt and they disrupt the flow of the music\n\n\nAll in all, Witching hour is a decent representation of the Dolan era Venom in a live setting, though I wouldn't expect to go into this and come out thinking it was a live \"classic\". \n\nNote: Fan's who dislike the Dolan era Venom probably won't be converted after hearing this album,so if you're one of those people, I'd give this a miss\n",
        "\nVenom is a lot of things to a lot of people. Some consider only their first four albums to be cannon and the rest shit where as others view their latter works as gold and their humble beginnings as garbage. Both have merit for what its worth as both eras have good and bad. Their mid-period however is perhaps the most overlooked and underrated in the bands history. Depending on who's side your on in the various breakups that the band is famous for you'll either agree or stop reading this now. \n\nOn Calm Before the Storm we see considerably better production and musicianship than in the past. Its easy to distinguish the individual instruments and music over all, as opposed to the bands early work. The guitars are very melodic and thrashy. There is a lot of dueling between the two guitarists, both of which are the best the band has ever had. The shredding is near ceaseless but melodic and fitting, not random fits of masturbatory flashiness. They add a tough and evil sense to the music, essentially adding where the less satanic lyrics leave off.\n\nThe bass is easily mistakable for Cronos' own, as Tony playing is very similar. The bass is its own entity and contains a vicious amount of attitude not always playing what the guitars are.\n\nThe drums are standard Abaddon and as such are both good and horrible. For the most part, the prior is thankfully the case. There are a few parts where he sounds bad but over all he's with it.\n\nAs stated above the vocals are eerily close to Cronos', to the point of cloning. This works in his favor as detractors of this incarnation of Venom will find it hard to differentiate between the two. The lyrics are more about life and myths than anything else, this is somewhat a breath of fresh air as the satanic thing had run its course and gotten stale.\n\nThe music easily slots in the melodic Thrash category with perhaps a few Power Metal nods here and there. The music is tight but loose. Its tough but enchanting, dark but catchy and fun. This is just what a good Thrash album should be a mixture of darkness, evil and fun. If there are any complaints it would be that this is painfully short and that some of the songs don't really go anywhere, but over all this is an electrifying album that should appeal to fans of the aforementioned.\n",
        "\nThe New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement yielded a lot of talented bands, many of which were underappreciated. Venom was not one of these. With a sound that was, at the time, the most reckless, menacing force in music, Venom rightly garnered acclaim and infamy. Though their music might appear a bit derivative nowadays, their striking sonic departure was pretty revolutionary at the time: one might call them the first extreme metal band. \n\nMuch debate goes on in the black metal community as to exactly how much influence (if any at all) Venom and the other so-called first-wave black metal bands contributed to the development of their beloved second-wave Norwegian stuff. Though I\u2019d say that they were pretty integral, this is of little concern to me: Venom were a much more important influence to thrash metal. Listen to Slayer\u2019s Show No Mercy album to hear the most direct evolution of Venom\u2019s sound, and the entire Teutonic scene, the South American thrash bands, and countless others feature characteristics that can be directly linked back to Venom\u2019s sound. \n\nAnd what a sound it is. Though they weren\u2019t entirely dissimilar from other NWOBHM bands (some of the up-tempo stuff on here is very Motorhead-ish), Venom\u2019s entire presentation is as terrifyingly unique as Black Sabbath\u2019s debut was a decade before. There are riffs that have a rocking NWOBHM vibe (\u201cSons of Satan,\u201d \u201cPoison\u201d) and then there are some that are dirty and fearsome (\u201cWitching Hour,\u201d \u201cOne Thousand Days in Sodom\u201d). The guitars are enveloped in fuzz and they sound like they\u2019re barely in tune, making leads and melodies sound all the more reckless. There\u2019s an almost intentional sloppiness to the record; the guitars and bass are so raw that you start to question whether some of the things you\u2019re hearing are really even there. The drums are produced pretty poorly too, but they\u2019re so frantic that it\u2019s excusable. Cronos\u2019 nearly atonal vocals are also a plus: his signature growl (drowned in reverb) and occasional shrieks have been echoed by Tom Araya and dozens of other thrash vocalists. \n\nLyrical content, devoted mostly to shock-value Satanism and blasphemies, was probably the most disturbing to listeners. These guys, with their out-of-the-gutter sound, devilish imagery, and overtly Satanic ambience (the backwards masking at the beginning of \u201cIn League with Satan\u201d for instance), was too much for parents and moral watchdog groups. Of course it was all an act, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from listening to this record.\n\nWith but one brief departure from the maelstrom (\u201cMayhem with Mercy,\u201d a Black Sabbath-esque interlude track), it\u2019s an almost completely virile extreme metal record. Diluted in light of the bands that it influenced, those groups would cease to exist if this album hadn\u2019t opened the door. Hopefully the potential buyer will excuse the redundancy that goes with reviewing an album of Welcome to Hell\u2019s notoriety and find a place for it in their collection.\n",
        "\nAny reasonable Venom fan must accept the unfortunate fact that this band stopped caring about their fans a long time ago. Having failed in their mission to become as big as Kiss, Venom were forced to face the fact they musically speaking, they just weren't all that hot. They couldn't fall back on their performing skills, so instead they started flooding the market with re-packages of the same material and a blitzkrieg of live albums, or \"assaults\" as they assured us. Some are good, some are bad, and then there's Official Bootleg, which is abysmal. Let me be clear on this: I love Venom, or rather I love what Venom were quite a long time ago. In a brief period of time '81-'84, they rewrote the rules on what extremity metal was capable of. But that time is over and has been over for some time. My point in bringing it up is that while I am a fan, I'm not such a sycophant that I'm blind to the torrent of crap this band have dumped upon us over the years.\n\nThis is perhaps the worst of the lot. Venom, in the live setting, have rarely delivered musically, often relying on their pyrotechnics to carry the day. But even for Venom, this is a disaster. Who knows if they were intoxicated, having equiptment troubles like bad monitors or whatever, but the bottom line is this album should never have been released. Titling this \"Official Bootleg\" (an oxymoron) seems like a lame attempt at masking it's atrocious nature. But as with all too many bootlegs, the sound quality isn't the issue here, it's the performance. Guitars are out tune, Cronos seems to barely play at all and when he does his bass is hopelessly out of tune as well. Worse, the band destroy, and I mean DESTROY their own songs. Some of the tracks here sound like they played them once before, tops. Just a real slap in the face to any fan buying this record with any expectation of quality.\n\nAnd judging from what I've read about recent festival appearances by the band (some being filmed for DVD release, god help us), not much has changed. You'd think after almost 30 years of ups and downs, Venom might have decided it was worth it to tighten up where it counts, in their music. But the emphasis with this band has always been on spectacle over substance and it's tragic. Let's all be brutally honest here. If not for the legendary, enduring quality of their brief period of genius, no-one would give a crap about this band these days. They've not given us much worth even mentioning in over 20 years now. Is time for us to pack them away and move on? I think so. Just make sure you've got Welcome To Hell, Black Metal and a goos singles compilation and you've got all you really need.\n",
        "\nProbably the only real gripe you can say about this album is that it isn't as classic as their first two albums, but having said that, Prime Evil is technically Venom's best album, at least performance wise. And with it coming out in the late 90's, you'd expect it to be overlooked, which it is, but even as godfathers' of the thrash scene, Venom absolutely blows away their offspring with this. \n\nSo Cronos isn't on vocals and bass? Well, instead we've got Tony Dolan, who proves to be a more than competent replacement. His bass lines are much more technical than Cronos' ever were, and musically correct at that. Vocally, Dolan delivers a menacing, dominating performance, sounding very similar to Cronos. \n\nThe music is much better composed, however it has a much stronger nod towards classic metal, rather than the raw, punk fueled metal that made Black Metal such a classic. This works both ways, obviously: on one hand, the songs are very coherent, very intense and technically perfect, but on the other, that nastiness was a trademark of Venom. But you've still got Abaddon's sloppy drumming, which though it never falls apart, when they pick up the speed, it feels like you're riding in a beat up old car that could collapse at any second. That gives the album a bit of a reckless feel, which I really like. \n\nThere are so many good songs on here. The title track fucking excellent, but the NWOBHM \"Harder than Ever\" really makes you want to throw you hand in the air and headbang. Great guitar solo in that one too. Most of the tracks are fast paced thrash numbers, like the absolutely maniacal \"Insane,\" \"Into the Fire,\" and \"Carnivorous\" but when they decide to slow it down on \"Blackened Are the Priests,\" the atmosphere is intense and gloomy. The Black Sabbath cover is driving and powerful, a really good rendition, I must say. Amazingly, the worst track is the rerecorded \"Live Like An Angel,\" which is sped up too much and loses its original charm. \n\nMantas' guitar work is really excellent all over the album. I didn't know how good of a guitarist he was until I heard Prime Evil. There are numerous melodies and soaring solos that instantly grab you, but never diminish the wickedness of the album. The nice parts might pop out very briefly, like shafts of sunlight through a stormy sky, but then Venom stomps on the accelerator and affirms the fact yes, this is still an evil album, and the malevolent riffing pulls you back in. \n\nFor 1989, this really gives the thrash genre a run for its money, surprising that Venom, who inspired the whole movement would dish out an album that would (in my opinion) overshadow the works of Megadeth, Testament and Slayer for that period. Seriously, this is better than So Far, So Good, So What, Practice What You Preach, and South of Heaven.\n",
        "\nWow, what happened to Venom? This album was supposed to be a reunion of the classic line-up and thus a return to the classic days of Welcome to Hell, alas it seems that by this point Venom just don't have it in them anymore.\n\nThere is absolutely no spirit or enthusiasm on this album at all, not a trace. The whole band just sound like they don't want to be there and don't care about the music they're recording at all. Back in their early days a lot of people didn't like them because they demphasized technicality and clarity in favour of wild enthusiasm and crude catchiness, but here they have none of that.\n\nSure, it really isn't THAT different from vintage Venom, soundwise, but it just sounds like the Possessed album regurgitated over again, with whatever little charm that LP had completely sucked out. I can't really put my finger on why the songwriting is so weak other than maybe they just didn't put as much effort in, or they had simply ran out of juice by this point. Maybe they favoured mid-paced songs more than faster monsters like Witching Hour and Black Metal, or maybe the riffs are just too bland and similiar, I don't know. Cronos has a bit more of a harder snarl to his voice, but it doesn't sound genuine at all, there's nothing as wicked as \"bloodluuuuuuuuust\" or that wicked snarl thing at the beginning of 'Teacher's Pet'. 'Destroyed and Damned' has a nice melodic introduction, and 'Infectous' is decent in that it's a little more chaotic than the reserved, controlled nature of the other songs, but it's just not enough.\n\nThis album's simply boring and even though it's no offensive it does absolutely nothing and goes on way too long. Only recommended to completists, this album does nothing but prove that UK black metal of the 90s sucks, and they should have broke up when Mantas left after Possessed.\n",
        "\nDon't get me wrong - I do think Venom is one of the most genre-defining bands ever, and their first couple of albums remain absolute classics. Especially \"Welcome to Hell\" is mandatory listening material, being a very early foray into a dark and forbidding musical territory, combining a NWOBHM approach with a Motorhead-esque sound with an occasionally satanic imagery. \n\nOn \"Metal Black\" they've apparently attempted to rediscover these dark and disturbing roots, but in that particular respect they've failed miserably. I don't doubt that, if your metallic music diet so far has consisted of unmentionables like Korn, POD, Linkin Park etc, you'll probably think this is heavy, evil shit. And you may not be entirely wrong, but the problem is that most of the tracks on this overlong album sound like a rehash of not only Venom's own previous material, but also of Slayer's, Pantera's and (aaaarrrrgh!) Machine Head's output. \n\nSome of the songs presented here are quite heavy, to be sure. But they are heavy in the wrong way - simple as that. Venom come across sounding more like a mix of a Pantera tribute and a Venom tribute band band than anything else (with the occasional Slayer-type riff thrown in for good measure). And some songs most certainly cross over into self parody-territory (I mean, come on, listen to 'Rege Satanas' - it sounds utterly ridiculous; a song probably designed to scare 15-year-old newcomers to metal).\n",
        "\nThe bane of age: a curse from decades reveled, or perhaps signals that exploit weakness not visible at hindsight. Ah Venom, you philosophical legends; always mincing each opportunity once black/speed metal followers crave more sliced items their forefathers impregnated. Welcome to the downfall. Yes, England\u2019s trophy-shiners had much to explain after pathetically clinching \u201cPossessed\u201d into the arms of metal fans, so what\u2019s there to do, huh? Cronos took Abaddon and whoever else was in Venom aside, emphasizing shit needed a makeover, and thus, \u201cCalm before the Storm\u201d popped out, but an issue cancelled its dormancy shortly thereafter: change couldn\u2019t process a hot agenda. A comfortable approach was promised; instead we received irritation. A sign of a once-good band faded away, or some avoidable mistake? That, my friends, is the question.\n\nAs inclement weather changes environments, \u201cCalm before the Storm\u201d looks upon Venom for needy alterations; this new frontier, however, acts positive like Hurricane Katrina meeting New Orleans. Newbie Syndrome confines Mykus (Mantas\u2019 sub-par replacement) into generic use of speed riffs done a million times before, with usually just one per song; not to mention his solos are lackluster when stacked against the former guitarist in Venom. Also, who wants mainstream verse-chorus-repeat foundations? Even if you don\u2019t, tough shit. This CD has a golden way of planting bothersome, poppy choruses that consume several anthems entirely, which grows like a weed until you\u2019re flooded by unneeded crap. We\u2019ve got eleven tunes all preaching copied factors, with a dangerous amount lasting under three minutes; of course, practically spelling out how repetitive/bland everything appears. Where\u2019s the progression, intelligence, envelope-pushing, or perhaps, testicles? Another thinker, I guess.\n\nCronos, too, has taken quite a nasty pinch within these lakes of vocal domination. Aggressive, menacing yelps are out of the picture, and this ironic figure now shouts in cleaner tone that really doesn\u2019t add productivity onto what\u2019s placed atop. Still, his bass looks pretty alright\u2026goddamn it, who made love to the guitar tone? Suddenly, Mykus seems quite feather-like upon viewing the puffier approach this album takes, meaning heavy stuff isn\u2019t really that crushing. I\u2019m wondering if Bon Jovi stole Venom\u2019s identity and produced \u201cCalm before the Storm\u201d for personal chuckles. Any highlights? Read the lyrics to \u201cMuscle,\u201d then come see me.\n\nBut seriously, Venom did score a few points throughout this unacceptable effort that are essentially passable towards their glory days. \u201cCalm before the Storm\u201d excels to its highest point on \u201cThe Chanting of the Priests;\u201d capturing modernized energy perfectly with those intense riffs equates a total sensation of speed metal chaos. More so, \u201cBlack Xmas\u201d and \u201cMetal Punk\u201d flag dying fame as both numbers scorch in the moniker of \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d rather elegantly, once again toasting your scrotum into yesterday. However, the irony of the first three cuts producing more energy than all others isn\u2019t quite relevant. Ideas ran dry shortly thereafter, so Cronos\u2019 only option was eight charges of filler nobody would dare recall. No wonder time forced Venom\u2019s settle devolution within unmemorable flop after unmemorable flop, eh? \n\nYou know, an experiment gone wrong is risky business, because adding that occasional twist will sometimes yield absolute mastery, yet Venom just got confused throughout their ventures: different guitar tones, simplified structures, lighter vocals, and the mainstreamed ideology\u2026just not my Venom. Hell, you won\u2019t ever hear a single note from this thud since the group squared away those needless tampers, so why compute an album of such redundancy anyway? In conclusion, it\u2019s very hard to find, looked down upon, and certainly forgettable, which is constituted throughout \u201cCalm before the Storm\u201d when puncturing each entity it offers. Not something I\u2019m suggesting, unless you REALLY enjoy risking your money for a hit-or-miss effort.\n\nThis review was written for: www.leviatan-magazine.com\n",
        "\nWritten off more times than Rocky Balboa, Venom came blustering back in 2006 with what must have been at least the 4th comeback CD bearing the band's name, 'Metal black'. Driven by bassist and frontman Cronos alone from the original trio, the CD was a very satisfying, if not slightly flawed, effort from the legendary black metal progenitors and the haste with which its successor, 'Hell', has been released (even allowing for the departure of guitarist Mike Hickey) reflects an obvious desire to finally build some momentum. \n\nContinuing in largely the same vein as 'Metal black', though with a slightly slower overall tempo, 'Hell' is another agreeable addition to the band's catalogue, though it must be said that the original Venom sound (i.e. snotty NWOBHM played too fast to bother staying in time) really isn't in evidence anywhere on the CD. Instead Cronos and his associates - brother Antton on drums and an unknown guitarist by the name of Rage \u2013 have crafted an oddly unique-sounding collection of songs that focus mostly on simplistic, pummelling riffs that requires a little patience to be enjoyed properly. \n\nThe production style lends to this aura \u2013 thankfully a step up from the rough-as-a-badger's-arse sound of 'Metal black' (surely down to a misguided attempt at replicating the rough-and-ready feel of the classics on modern equipment rather than genuine incompetence?), but definitely still very sparse and abrasive, and sure to dissuade listeners more sensitive to this aspect of the music. \n\nA meaty proportion of the songs have great focus on mid-tempo chug, with Cronos' bass clanging so loudly that a guitar is barely necessary while the vocalist wretches out his usual underrated lyrical stylings. On first listen this makes the CD seems uninspired and painfully repetitious, but a few spins later and the songs dig their way into the brain and develop a hypnotic and impossible catchiness. 'Hand of god' and the doomish 'Blood sky' are possibly the best examples of this style. \n\nNot to say that there isn't an injection of pace from time to time, and when 'Hell' does pick up speed the results are superb. \"Kill the music\", presumably a long-overdue jibe at former drummer Abaddon, is a nicely spiteful little number, and is also the only song on display to properly hark back to the early Venom sound, while the controversy-courting 'USA for satan' makes for an amusing end to the CD. \n\nWhile more consistent than 'Metal black' (though with fewer moments of stand-out brilliance), 'Hell' unfortunately is just a tad overlong and would have been helped by the trimming of a couple of weak moments that cause the CD to suffer overall. 'Stab u in the back' is hampered by a weak chorus, which is a shame as it is, along with 'Evil perfection' and 'The power and the glory' (even allowing for a pretty poor pseudo-death growls on the latter) one of the more 'musical' songs on the CD. 'Fall from grace,' though, is the stick-out weak track, with the decent drum-and-vocal verses undermined by some second-rate, groovy riffs. The instrumental outro track \"Dirge/The awakening\" also feels unnecessary and out of place after the extended conclusion to \"USA for satan\", and it would have been better to have it either worked into a full song or dropped altogether. \n\nIn spite of these limitations though, 'Hell' is a definite triumph for Venom in their current incarnation, and more than justifies their continued existence as a recording entity. An unusual CD to be sure, and one that needs to be given some time to work its peculiar charms on the listener, but it proves well worth the effort in the end. \n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalcdratings.com/)\n",
        "\nIn August 1981 Venom had originally been asked by Neats boss David Wood to record some demos of all their songs, the band were given three days. After the session David said that he would like to release the demos as an Album. Venom had made their first Album deal. The same cover as the In League With Satan single was used, although the Record Company generously agreed to print the cover in Gold & Black..\n\nVenoms debutalbum was the first - and possibly only - truly groundbreaking album to came out of the NWOBHM, no one had heard anything like Welcome To Hell before and the album hit down as a bomb. Each and one of the total eleven tracks is clear direct hits that never come to submit your memory. Certain - a little bit of Mot\u00f6rhead and the attitude from Punk but nevertheless something entirely new. The intensity in the tunes and Cronos cheeky barren song compares nothing contemporary. Striking is also which self-confidence and pondus this debut album smokes. The tunes vary from slow and heavy to fast and brutal. \n\nThe introductory Sons Of Satan opens skullcrushing and lets the immediate hell to break out. What a sound! With the massive speedy drumslaming, twangy bass and instantly infectious guitar riffs the production feels like one big filthy iron fist on the jaw. Tentimes harder than everyone those cushions today's studios throw forward together. Rawness is the word. The title tune takes at and is with it's suggestive mainriff a favourite that Venom never omitt from their liveset. The third track Schizo oscillates conscintiously and is an excellent example on Venoms unique ability to may together one insane speed with one catchy chorus. All big records need a respiration hole and that 47 seconds instumental Mayhem Without Mercy is precise what man needs in order to retrieve breath before Poison and Live Like An Angel ( Die Like A Devil) completes the first side. Both tunes incredible good.\n\nSide two of the vinyl opens with the absolute classic Witching Hour, possibly Venom's single most important track, in it you'll hear a number of stylistic devices that would later pervade all extreme metal genres. Next up is the mighty 1000 Days In Sodom with good chorus and great bulldozer bass from Cronos. Angel Dust, twice as fast as the demoversion, unashamedly glorifies the drug that makes its users think they have the strength of rhinos. The hits just keep coming - In League With Satan, this favourite comes complete with backwards satanic intro, tribal-like drums and slow brooding riffs. I literally feel I'm \"south of heaven\" when this song is on. One last thing worthy of noting is the opening riff to the albums closer, Red Light Fever, I believe to be the HEAVIEST riff in 1981, hands down.\n\nThe record's grade are indisputable, highest possible and Welcome To Hell is a benchmark by which other musical extremists are still judged. \n\nVenomfreaks.

        "\nThe godfathers of black metal are still at it, and Metal Black, while not even close to the highs attained way back in the early 1980s, shows that the band can still let loose a furious wall of sound with only a trio setup. Cronos is the only original member remaining on this album, and his vocal and bass skills are still great, and maybe even a bit better than the old days. While Mantas\u2019 chainsaw riffs are indeed missed, his replacement (for the second time, no less) Mykus does manage to stamp his own style of guitar playing onto the Venom sound with generally good results. Drummer Antton is back after his excellent performance on Resurrection, and he\u2019s just as tight on the kit here as on the previous LP.\n\nMetal Black is indeed a return to the feel, lack of production values, and songwriting style of the classic Venom days, with a bit of a new sound thrown in. There\u2019s nothing fancy about the song craft here. Cronos and Mykus let loose a wave of blasphemous riffage with Cronos belting out the now-typical lyrical content. Every song does have a solo, which is a good thing despite the fact that Mykus loves pinch harmonics a bit too much in a few songs. Cronos\u2019 lyrics are of special note. With the heaviness of the guitars, especially the bass, as the inspiration, Cronos does paint a very hellish picture with his words, and tracks like House of Pain and Rege Satanas benefit immensely from the added atmosphere. Metal Black is probably the darkest Venom LP since Black Metal, which is no small praise knowing Cronos\u2019 modus operandi for Venom lyrics \u2013 Satan, women, leather, and fucking HELL, all written with just the right balance between danger and camp. It\u2019s what made Venom such a bad apple (in a good way of course) in 1982.\n\nAs far as the quality of the songwriting is concerned, Metal Black is about on the same level as Possessed, and maybe At War With Satan if you\u2019re more forgiving. No real \u201chits\u201d number among the album\u2019s 14 slabs of unholy terror, but we\u2019re left instead with 14 solid, catchy tunes. There really isn\u2019t a bad track on this album, and for a band nearing the 30 year mark in their career, for them to have had such a decent record in 2006 was nothing short of a miracle. Antechrist is the typical Venom opener; an absolute assault on the senses, and a great way to start the LP. Of course there are the typical thrashers like Assassin and Rege Satanas, although there are some divergences into slower territory on Darkest Realm and House of Pain. The band experiments a bit with bridges in the songwriting, with tracks like A Good Day To Die and Lucifer Rising having interesting melodic segments. Maleficarvm, with its hellish grandeur, harkens back to the title track from At War With Satan. Of course, Venom has to leave us with a title track, and this LP is no exception. Metal Black, the song, will literally grab you by the balls and force you to bang your fucking head. I don\u2019t think Venom ever played so fast and so recklessly; you can hear that the guitars and drums have trouble staying in sync with each other, but the sheer speed and reckless abandon of the song redeems it.\n\nMetal Black is better than it really should have been considering Venom\u2019s age, and the fact that pretty much the last 20 years haven\u2019t been good to them at all. It\u2019s no Welcome To Hell or Black Metal, and while some will definitely write off the LP due to the lack of Mantas\u2019 guitar work, every Venom fan should at least check this one out. Don\u2019t expect something that\u2019ll have Venom shaking metal to its foundation (welcome to 1982), just expect a decent metal LP.\n",
        "\nWhere would\u00b4ve the underground ended up without the likes of Mot\u00f6rhead and Venom? Their groundbreaking combination of speed, white noise and pounding double bass was unlike anything else, drawing the blueprints for metal madness to come. While Mot\u00f6rhead stuck to the biker look and streetwise attitude, it was Venom\u00b4s satanic imagery that danced with the devil. The beast had crept into the music previously with Ozzy screaming \u201cNo. No\u201d as satan was coming around the bend, but not until Cronos chanted \u201cEvil. In League With Satan\u201d was the horned one so effectual as he headbanged along to the beat of the band. Although the antics of Venom may have been somewhat tongue in cheek, it was this persona that influenced countless band in the underground today. Venom were probably the most influential NWOBHM band of them all, unwittingly created the genre of music known as Black Metal. Probably Death Metal and Thrash Metal as well. This is of course old facts but the interesting thing is whether the casual Venom fan really needs anything more than their seminal early-80\u00b4s output?\n\nThe answer is yes. The new album Hell have certainly harnessed the horribly raw, shambolic fury that first endeared them to black-hearted headbangers nearly 30 years ago. It might lack the peaks of 2006\u00b4s Metal Black but is overall a stronger album. Hell is compared to its predecessor more experimental and has just a little more bite. And it\u00b4s definitely a grower. Tracks like The Power And The Glory and Hand Of God didn\u00b4t impress me the first spinnings but feels above average today. Cronos incredible bowel-loosening demongrowls remain the focal point of blasters like Armageddon and Evilution Devilution, but with the new La Rage replacing guitarist Mykvus the band have pushed the sound in a slightly more brutal and straightforward direction. And it suits them perfect. A great example is the awesome Fall From Grace, with its infectious raw guitarriff. Venom have truly delivered a great album. Stuffed full of anthems that shows that they are still black, still metal and still alive. Honest old-school metal, made by a band who understand the style better than anyone. From the opening Straight To Hell, a song guaranted to get fists punching in the air, through the galloping mighty titletrack, over the aggressive and savage Evil Perfection to the last scary deathgrowls of Cronos on Dirge/The Awakening, this is a band that shows they are on great form. In fact, the only slight dip comes with Blood Sky, but soon enough we\u00b4re back on track with the hamfisted rumpus of USA For Satan, Cronos boxing your ears once again and La Rage conjuring up some red-hot licks over Anttons six-cylinder thrusting drums. The Legions sure will not be disappointed. Welcome back to Hell, lads.\n\nVenomfreaks, check out my Venompage:\nwww.venomcollector.com\n",
        "\nVenom is not only a force to be reckoned with, but a band that every metalhead owes him/herself to give it a listen. While their first 3 albums are regarded as classics by many metalheads, the band\u2019s newest release, Hell, is pretty damn good to.\n\nThe album is mostly composed of really straightforward tracks. Seriously, if you just want some NWOBHM with plenty of speed, thrash and occasional nu metal flourishes, than you can do no wrong with this album. Hell is actually pretty polished compared to Venom\u2019s other releases. The guitars have plenty of crunch, the bass has a very prominent position in the songs, hell, its fully audible and gives the songs this really percussive quality, making the songs very \u201cbrutal\u201d and very memorable. The vocals are just as raspy and evil as ever, and really, they would put many thrash, death and black metal bands to shame when comparing the quality, I mean, how old is Cronos, in his mid 40s, and he can still growl like many of the younger growlers, seriously, that just brightens, er, darkens I mean, the mood in the songs.. The drums sound like they are being played by the devil himself, full of wicked and twisting rhythms that will remind you of pagan and \u201csatanic\u201d rituals, and proves that Antton was the perfect replacement for Abaddon. \n\nThe lyrics are filled with the typical Venom subject matter, that is, Satan, and other related matters. The lyrics, as we\u2019ve all come to expect from Venom, are probably for shock value and laughs rather than actual beliefs, or at least that\u2019s what it looks like. Still, it would be interesting if Venom would play around with the lyrics more, since most of us have probably heard/read this stuff before.\n\nOverall, if you want some quality NWOBHM from a legendary and ultra influential metal band, then get Hell. It\u2019s a great album, worth most pennies you\u2019ll invest in it. A worthwhile release.\n",
        "\nI feel I have to stand up for Venom here with \u2018Metal Black\u2019. I grabbed this after losing touch with the aging, bad old grandads of thrash metal during the tedium of the \u2018Dolan Years\u2019 after being given a recommendation by someone who probably knows my tastes in Metal probably better than I do myself\u2026and I wasn\u2019t dissappointed.\n\n\nSod who\u2019s backing Cronos up nowadays. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Mike Hickey or Mickey Mouse playing guitar \u2013 the guy may not have Mantas ability to coax previously unheard tortured shrieks out of a guitar solo, but he isn\u2019t far off \u2013 the opening solo on \u2018Antechrist\u2019 rocks! And the (younger?) Lant\u2019s drumming, no offence to Abaddon, is just damn better\u2026\n\n\nSod the slightly erratic mixing \u2013 since when did any of this band\u2019s best work have anything even vaguely resembling decent production values? This album has all that same pulsating bass work, the same chugging riffing and pounding drums associated with awesome numbers like \u2018Seven Gates of Hell\u2019 and the same dirty songwriting style that always made Venom sound like the punks they started off as even when they were singing about choirs of demonic angels and satanic beasties. If anything there is a lyrical style here that is moving away from those cliches and into new territory which suits the dirtiness even better (\u2018Assassin\u2019, \u2018Blessed Dead\u2019).\n\n\nThere are some slightly odd strayings into melody, I\u2019ll grant you \u2013 the odd little midsection in \u2018Lucifer Rising\u2019 was woefully out of place for example, and one or two of the slower numbers such as \u2018Hours of Darkness\u2019 do sound a touch laboured, but for the most part this album pounds. Sure there are those that would have preferred a bit more speed and a bit less beatdown but what the hell? It\u2019s a favourite request of my eldest, bless her heandbanging little heart - and that\u2019s a sign that it has something major going for it because the other Venom albums never were before she heard this one.\n\n\nIn short, despite some slightly more\u2026restrained\u2026moments than previous outings this is still a damn catchy, heavy as hell, turn-up-the-volume-and-slam outing that shows up the polished warbles of the new millenium\u2019s \u2018Metal\u2019 for what it is \u2013 overproduced, overblown and certainly overrated. All you need to make a good Metal album is bass, drums, guitar and a shedload of attitude \u2013 and that\u2019s something \u2018Metal Black\u2019 has in abundance.\n",
        "\nI loved Venom's first two albums, haven't yet gotten my hands on At War With Satan, but found that Possessed was a bit sloppy and drawn out. I wondered what Venom would sound like with two guitar players, replacing the mighty Mantas. \n\nI can't say that this sounds like Disney. This is not so out there that it could be labeled as a different band, because we've still got the necessary Venom ingredients all in the mix. Possibly a bit experimental, but not bad in that way. The songs seem a bit more concise, but sadly, also more geared towards commercialism: they're shorter, with obvious hooks. Just listen to \"Chanting of the Priests,\" with its cleaner vocals...not really Venom, is it? \"Under A Spell\" is similar, with a sing along chorus. Quite goofy. Sometimes those clean vocals sound really irritating and obnoxious, but overall, don't destroy the album. \n\nSo what does really put it under the table? The songs are pretty short and predictable. Even worse, there's not a lot that really jumps out and grabs you. I would have actually enjoyed more experimentation, but a lot of the ideas just feel bland and tired. The second half of the album can sometimes just pass me by. \n\nBut there are some great moments. The title track, though a bit unorthodox with its epic and often melodic sound, is fucking great. Seriously, one can imagine a storm brewing at the horizon while listening to that. \"Black Xmas\" is heavy, total Venom, and \"Metal Punk\" actually feels heavier than you'd think. \n\nThe production is rough, and as I've said, there are fuck ups here and there. But this is Venom. The two new guitarists provide some very nice, over the top soloing, that gives it a slicker sound, but not without the nastiness brewing beneath the surface. Worth getting if you're a big fan, but a casual listener best pick up Welcome To Hell or Black Metal.\n",
        "\nI picked this up hoping it to be a continuation of the sheer awesomeness that was Resurrection (My Favourite Venom album), or even Cast in Stone. I have mixed opinions as to whether it is.\n\nThe album itself isn't necessarily a bad album, not by a long shot, but there's something about this that's a bit of a letdown.\n\nCronos' vocals are good as ever, but are getting a bit racked with age. There are flaws in his vocal style, but there's always been flaws in Venom, so it's not really that big a problem. The bass does it's thing happily (although maybe a bit too loud) and is very good for what it does. Antton's drumming is superb, it owns Abaddon by far. Abaddon has even admitted himself that he couldn't drum as good as Antton on Resurrection no matter how hard he tried and Antton continues to buck the Venom trend by putting in a superb performance, however it's still no match for the drumming on Resurrection. Mike Hickey, the rent-a-guitarist of Carcass and Cathedral fame and most certainly the Nick Barker of Guitar, puts in a good performance. Although his riffing may not be up to scratch compared to Mantas, his soloing is excellent and really livens up this album.\n\nThe songs themselves are good. But are a bit indistinguishable from each other, falling into one of 2 camps, the slow crunchy numbers and the thrash tunes. Stylistically, it could be seen as a mix of Resurrection and Cast in Stone, but without the memorable songs of either. It doesn't have the short, sharp riffage of Resurrection or the devilish charm of Cast In Stone. It's still better than Tony Dolan-era Venom and of Possessed/Calm Before The Storm, but really isn't essential. One thing notable of this album is the fact that it's more \"Venom\" than Resurrection. Around the time of Resurrection, Cronos went on about how the album was \"A more modern-sounding Venom. It's the old stuff, but with a better sound\". It really wasn't. It was more of a modern Metal album with a Venom touch than it was Venom with a modern touch. This re-addresses the problem and has all the usual Venom riffs, drums and Vocals you expect, but you can actually hear it!\n\nThe artwork for this release is also top-notch to say the least, one of the finest Venom covers ever, possibly only beaten by Resurrection.\n\nSo far so good. However, this album has many faults. One is in the Album length and layout. It's 57 minutes long with 14 tracks. Resurrection had 13 tracks and was 55 minutes long but that didn't drag nearly as much as this does. There is quite a bit of filler. We really don't need \"House of Pain\", \"Death and Dying\", \"Darkest Realm\", \"Lucifer Rising\" OR \"Hours of Darkness\". This is 20 minutes of unneeded filler that should definetely have been trimmed from the album and released maybe as B-sides or one of the endless Venom compilations. If that had been the case, I would have given this album probably about 15% more than it gets. Also, the layout's all wrong... Tracks are muddled about too much here to have any great effect. My perfect tracklisting would have been:\n\n\"Antechrist\"\n\"Metal Black\"\n\"Burn In Hell\"\n\"A Good Day To Die\"\n\"Assassin\"\n\"Blessed Dead\"\n\"Sleep When I'm Dead\"\n\"Maleficarvm\"\n\"Rege Satanas\"\n\nIf they had ended it with the chant of \"Satanas... Satanas...\", it would have been far more effective and gripping than that of Metal Black.\n\nAnother problem is the lyrics. Venom aren't exactly known for their philosophical and poignant lyrics but this is taking the piss. These sentences don't even make sense. \"Our time is here - through the wars of the damned\"? \"We lasted throughout - despite holy lies - Impotent to deny\"? What the hell? Venom are Impotent? Can we expect Cronos to be fronting Viagra commercials soon? Swearwords seem to be injected for the sole purpose of \"shocking\" along with gratuituous references to Sex and Drugs all the time, and really the only thing shocking about them is how bad they are. Even the title: \"Metal Black\", that's just damn lazy. Yes, it's \"A nod to the old days\", but it's cashing in on nostalgic old metalheads and if that was the best attempt they could come up with, why the hell bother? The lyrics are ALL about Satan, Hell, Evil or Death in it's many forms. Then again, this is Venom, not Dream Theater, The lyrics are always about Satan, Hell, Evil or Death in it's many forms anyway, but would it kill Cronos to break the mould a smidgen and write about something else? The upcoming new album \"Hell\" says that it would kill Cronos to break the mould.\n\nAnother thing that pisses me off about this album is the production. It's shit. Not shit in the way that \"Black Metal\" and \"Welcome To Hell\" were. Just poor. It isn't raw or anything like that, it's just a lacklustre production. It's all a bit muddy with a Bass which is way too loud, and Guitar and drums which really melt into each other and become unintelligible. It's also very dry, there's nothing to the production. It just sounds like your average modern-day metal album.\n\nBut the worst thing about this album is the song \"Assassin\". It's a good song, but Venom have put their heart and soul into ruining this song for me. They want to be bad, they want it to be shit. First of all, it has a completely different production from the rest of the album, much quieter and generally worse. Then they sprinkle awesome riffs with really not awesome riffs (This happens quite a lot on the album though). Then they put the worst solo ever in the history of anything over it. It isn't even a solo, it's just Mike Hickey hitting random notes in vain, widdling like a 10 year old playing a guitar, or an especially bad Dragonforce solo. Then there's the pretty poor Chorus which consists of \"Assassin\" over and over again awkwardly. But do I like it? Yes. Why? I don't know to be honest. I just do. No matter how hard Venom try.\n\nIn conclusion, this album is good and bad. It has way too much filler to be considered a true classic and drags on for much too long. It pales in comparison to \"The classics\" and is by far the worst of the post-Dolan era, but still beats anything between Possessed and Temples of Ice. It tries to mix the attitude of Cast In Stone with the sheen of Resurrection, and injects the old Venom-style back into their songs, after the modern metal riffing of Resurrection, but is let down by the fact that most of the filler songs are either re-treads of old Venom done pretty badly or are a hodge-podge of good ideas glued together with loads of really crap ideas which are all badly produced. This could've been much better. It could've been a fantastic album, a true Venom classic. But it's not. And never will be. Go buy Resurrection first, then put this near the end of your Venom shopping list. You'll like some of the songs but the whole experience will make you feel empty and bored. I would recommend you go download the tracklisting I mentioned above, or download these highlights: \"Antechrist\", \"Metal Black\", \"Sleep When I Die\" and \"Good Day To Die\".\n",
        "\nWhen this little monstrosity first hit the music scene way back in 1981 few people knew what to make of it. Released by a small independent U.K. label called Neat Records, the music contained within must have shocked the crap out of anyone brave enough to venture past the pentagram adorned cover and give it a listen. What awaited the unsuspecting listener was music so raw, amateurish sounding and badly produced, yet at the same time aggressive, original and dripping with attitude.\n\nIt's never been a great secret that Venom were not the best of musicians. Even the band themselves have admitted as much on numerous occasions. Mantas' guitar work is fairly simplistic, Cronos' base playing was barely adequate and Abaddon's drumming is downright horrible. Yet it all somehow seems to fit together quite nicely. It seems as though the band members were aware of their respective limitations as musicians and did not attempt anything they wouldn\u2019t be able to handle. And the end result is surprisingly good.\n\nWhat we have here is a collection of N.W.O.B.H.M. proto-thrash classics. Despite often being credited as the godfathers of black metal, death metal and extreme metal in general, those expecting to hear music that actually resembles any of those sub-genres here will be sadly disappointed. The music is fast, furious and aggressive, with obvious nods to Motorhead (sonically) and Black Sabbath (thematically). All the songs are extremely catchy, and you can\u2019t help but feel a sense of fun about the whole album, despite the rather dark and evil subject matter. Standout tracks are \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d, \u201cLive Like an Angel\u201d, \u201cIn League with Satan\u201d, \u201c1,000 Days in Sodom\u201d and the absolute classic (and much covered) \u201cWitching Hour\u201d.\n\nAnother thing that must be also mentioned is that the production here is absolutely horrendous. The whole album sounds as if it was actually recorded somewhere in the pits of Hell, and this may put some people off. Guitar sound is very muddy and the drums sound like cardboard boxes. It all sounds very cheap and amateurish, yet somehow it would be hard to imagine it any different. It definitely fits the dark, sinister and filthy atmosphere of the songs.\n\nThe one thing about Venom that is unfortunately lost on a lot of people is their great sense of humour. Someone once described them as \u201cthe Monty Python of heavy metal\u201d and I couldn\u2019t agree more. Their ultra-evil personas and satanic posturing are so over the top it is downright hilarious. Their lyrics dealing with all sorts of evil, occult and satanic subject matter are very much tongue-in-cheek, as is their whole image. Once could say that in some ways they\u2019re more \u201cSpinal Tap\u201d than Spinal Tap.\n\nHaving said that, there\u2019s no denying Venom\u2019s importance in shaping heavy metal into what it is today, and this album stands as a fine document of their contribution to the genre. Every song here is an absolute classic and exudes energy, charm and passion that is often lacking in more technical and musically proficient releases. However, those expecting high-end musicianship and great sonic fidelity may want to stay away. Others who don\u2019t hold such things in high regard and enjoy their music rough, dirty and mean should enjoy and appreciate this historic release.\n",
        "\nBack in the 90's, rarity collections were becoming as common cover albums by big name bands. Hey, I love rarity collections because I'm a collector so I have an insane erg to own every song by a band. Since I love these collections so much it comes as no surprise as why I bought Skeleton's in the Closet, a compilation compiled by Venom drummer Tony \"Abaddon\" Bray. \n\nThis rarities compilation covers only the original early 80's Cronos era of the band, which is a shame as the band had a lot of rare material from the late 80's-early 90's Demolition Man era too. The release is compromised of rare unreleased songs, remixes, demos, and other odd tidbits.\n\nThe new unreleased songs are Snot's Shit, Dead on Arrival, Sadist (Mistress of the Whip), and Hounds of Hell. Some of these songs are outtakes, some are demos, but all the songs are actually quit bad and the production on them is even worse than Venom's first two full length albums. Snot's Shit, despite its humorous title, is probably the worst Venom song I have ever heard.\n\nAlong with the unreleased songs, we also get some remixed material as well. Some people like remixes, but I personally could give a shit. We get a remix of Welcome to Hell, Possessed, and uncut \"abbey road\" version of Manitou and a full re-edited version of At War With Satan. The only thing notable about the Welcome to hell remix is that it has the bands tour intro attached to the front of it. It's the intro that goes \"ladies and gentlemen, from the very depths of hell....VENOM!\". The only thing different about the At War with Satan re-edit as it gives the narrator speech that occurs at the end of the original version and moves it up to the beginning of the song.\n\nUnique to this release at the time but now very common on the hundreds of Venom compilations out there is the addition of the original three Venom 1980 demo songs (from the demo Demon) with Clive \"Jesus Christ\" Archer on vocals. The production on these are actually quite good (compared to early Venom production that is) and Archer does sound pretty close to Cronos.\n\nOther odd tidbits include advertisements for the album At War with Satan, tour intros, and even Radio I.D's from the band which are quit funny and show off their great sense of British humor. \n\nOverall I'm giving this release a generous 70 for the fact that it's a rarities compilation with unique material for die hard fans. Just remember it doesn't necessarily mean great material.\n\nAlso, if you get the original Castle release, make sure to check out the band picture in the booklet/sleeve as it is one of the most hilarious and odd pictures of the band I have ever seen.\n",
        "\nThis album, is complete and utter garbage. I am a HUGE Venom fan, and this is highly disappointing.\n\nAlright, let's start off by first looking at the album. It's got cool cover art... and that's about the only thing good about this album. If the name of the album, or any of the track titles doesn't instantly turn you away, then I feel sorry for the shit-fest you're about to hear. They titled the album \"Metal Black,\" a reversal of the name of their cult classic. Wow, really lame and cheesy. The cheese doesn't stop there though. The very first track on the album is \"Antechrist,\" a horrible misspelling, done on purpose. The lyrics aren't much better. Seriously, this shit is what I'd expect coming from a 13 year old.\n\nThe music, if you can believe it, is worse than the semantics. Let's start with the vocals. I don't know what happened, but they now sound like Cronos trying too hard to be harsh, instead of them feeling natural. They feel extremely forced, and completely suck. However the vocals aren't nearly as bad as the guitars and drums. The guitarist here LOVES pinch harmonics a little too much. I think that's all he knows how to do is pedal tones and pinch harmonics, because that's all he uses. The riffs are extremely boring and lack-luster, on top of being terribly generic. The drums aren't helping the cause either, The drums are constantly falling behind. No technicality at all to them, just basic beats, that get fucked up. He's always off beat, and highly inconsistent. I've heard 9 year olds that could keep a steadier beat, and I'm not even joking when I say that.\n\nOn top of how shitty the music is, lets throw in a really BAD mixing job. First off, the bass is WAY too loud, and is very over-powering. By the time you turn the bass down on your EQ low enough that it won't blow your speakers, the guitars are almost inaudible, as their tone all came from the bass end. I spent an hour trying to find an EQ setting that worked for this album, and I couldn't even come close to making it sound good.\n\nThe only reason I gave this album a 5 is for having the coolest album art of any Venom album.\n",
        "\nI'm not going to get to deep into the legacy or history of this album because I feel most of the other reviewers have covered these grounds much more adeptly than I personally could have. With that said I will comment that I believe the breakthrough Venom made with this album was that they pioneered a gritty authenticity and an energy unrivaled at the time.\n\nWhen I picked up this record and flipped over the cover-which was arresting enough- I was dazzled by the prototype for the artwork of almost every black metal album to follow. Each band member dubbed his own personal demoniker, the creative interpretation of instrumentation (bulldozer bass, chainsaw guitar, nuclear warheads) and the ax-wielding band photos. Even the somewhat puzzling instruction at the bottom corner:\" If this record is scratched or damaged in anyway please throw it away and buy a new one!\" had a certain attitude in it, like you don't know what your getting into just listening to the album. \n\nAnd you don't! If you've been consumed by the second wave of black metal too long to be bothered with records this early (shame on you) then you aren't prepared for how the same satanic expression is presented on this album. If you were looking for some mindless, good time Rock 'N' Roll then you may not be prepared to make the spiritually abusive investment in the darkness contained here.\n\nNow onto the track listing. This album is a chaotic racket from start to finish aside from unique and memorable moments-but not that it isn't all memorable! Sons of Satan brings us up to high adrenaline pace and Welcome to Hell locks is a solid headbanging rhythm machine. Oh and that vocal refrain, \"Welcome to HELL\", first contestant for best album moment. Schizo demonstrates well another BM album fundamental-song transitions. Playing off the tightened up ending of the last track , Schizo is launched by a single chord tone wrung out and a drum that picks up the pace again.\n\nThe fourth track displays yet another novelty of the BM album invented here. Mayhem with Mercy, as well as being the namesake of the Norwegian gods, is an instrumental exemplar of what became a requirement of any album boasting a taste for the dark arts. The ambiance is soon disrupted by a tumultuous guitar intro to one of the most Rock 'N' Roll songs on the album: POISON! Raunchy, devilish lyrics. Listen for the second guitar break down, the whole band demonstrates their apparently superb grasp of dynamics in a quarter of a minute here. It takes them only a split second to drop to a greatly decreased volume not displayed on any other rocker on this album-this moment. I believe, takes the cake for best album moment. Closing side one is a track I thought would've made a great opener Live Like an Angel (Die like a Devil). Pure blasphemic fun.\n\nThere's not much more I can say about the second side other than its a collection of some great thrashers. WITCHING HOUR!!! ('nuff said). 1000 Days in Sodom has one of the greatest, heaviest riffs in the Venom repertoire, pure melodic royalty. Angel Dust, although a somewhat simply written song, will demolish you with the speed and force of a train wreck. In League With Satan is the song they play at Lucifer's birthday party after the third round of beers are downed. You can practically hear the mugs clinking. The album ends on a grittier and perhaps disillusioning note-the tail of a passionate and dissonant night with a prostitute.\n\nMy advice to you in having the most enjoyable experience with Venom's \"Welcome to Hell\" is get drunk, get destructive, and worship Satan!\n",
        "\nWhichever way you look at it, 'Welcome To Hell' is a massively important album in the history and development of metal in general, let alone kick-starting the thrash/speed metal sub-genre. It may not be entirely original; right from the opening track, 'Sons Of Satan', there's a distinct Motorhead feel, whilst 'Schizo', 'Poison' and 'Angel Dust' hint at some underlying punk influence; in other places there are tinges of Judas Priest and NWOBHM. These are only elements of the whole, though, and Venom added to the mix plenty of distortion, aggression and an overall sound that was completely their own. \n\nSabbath had created metal that was doom-laden and oppressive, Motorhead and Priest made it heavier and faster, but up until this point nothing in metal packed quite as much punch for sheer intensity and raw aggression. There's no denying that this release paved the way for US bands that emerged over the next few years: Metallica, Slayer, Exodus. Early black metal bands like Bathory and Norway's Mayhem (who took their name from this album), both acknowledged Venom, and their influence can also be heard on early recordings by Possessed - cited by many as the first true death metal band. \n\n'Welcome To Hell' may not be a masterpiece, but it does contain some real gems: 'Live Like An Angel (Die Like A Devil)' is a deftly-executed thrasher and does actually demonstrate their ability to play (!), while 'Witching Hour' (later covered by Mayhem on their legendary 'Deathcrush' mini-album) is surely the first true thrash metal classic. 'In League With Satan', with it's tribal rhythms and Cronos's evil-sounding, echo-chamber growl, laid the groundwork for black metal (though it bears little relation to today's exponents of the sub-genre such as Emperor and Cradle Of Filth) and the album finishes with the wonderfully chaotic 'Red Light Fever'. \n\nOkay, the production is muddy and grimy, some of the playing is a little sloppy at times and the guitars are out-of-tune, but when I listen to this record I'm hit by the raw intensity of it, and playing it recently I felt the same sense of exhilaration as I did on first hearing it some 20 years ago. For me, the rough edges in the production (or lack of it) adds to the spontaneous feel of the record in the same way as it did with something like The Stooges' red-raw classic 'Funhouse'. If you want polished, note-for-note, perfectly-performed rock, you can always buy the latest Aerosmith or Def Leppard release! Personally, I\u2019m not that fussy, and this record still kicks ass!\n",
        "\nWell, sort of. The title track of this album is long enough to satisfy any Rush fan, yet metal enough to make Rush fans hate it. The guitar tone is thicker on this album and the drums are loud as fuck. The way Mantas' guitar plays through one speaker while Cronos' bass plays through the other is a good effect, an effect that Sodom would pick up on later on their \"Get What You Deserve\" album. \n\nThis album was to \"make or break\" for Venom, and wierdly enough, the world got neither. It sold well enough but it was short of the breakthrough that people were anticipating. There are a few key factors in why this was so.\n\nA few of the songs are quite lifeless and lack in riffing power. Stand Up (And Be Counted) should be mentioned here. It has more ringing chords and anthemic lyrics than the speedy riff fest of the Venom of yore. Also, Aaaaaaarrgh! is funny but I wouldnt qualify it as a song, as I'm sure they wouldnt be able to play it again if they wanted to, and I think it was intended to be that way in the first place. Genocide seems to build up every now and then, but once you expect it to start kicking ass, it just plods along some more. There is a nice riff used around the chorus though.\n\nI might have condemned this album with my aforementioned statements, but there are some real Venom classics on hand here. The title track is of course amazing from start to finish, including everything that people love about metal. Rip Ride ranks among my Venom favorites for its riff power that brings me back to the Welcome to Hell days. Also, Cry Wolf is an experiment without failing or sounding lame.\n\nOnce again, many bonus tracks are on hand from the Manitou single, the Warhead single, and \"At War With Satan TV Adverts\". Manitou is another experiment, very catchy, but the chorus can get annoying at times. Warhead is an ugly, slow, brooding motherfucker, while Seven Gates of Hell is an immediate classic, even still in the Venom setlist to this very day. On the other hand, Woman and Dead of Night are both forgettable.\n\nIn conclusion, this is no Black Metal or Welcome to Hell, but its very much worth giving attention to, if only for the title track, Seven Gates of Hell, and Rip Ride.\n",
        "\nThis is where Venom got their act together (in my opinion). The production is light years better, the vibe is darker, and they sound more \"together\" as it were. Abaddon is still the shittiest drummer this side of Lars Ulrich, but he was at the top of his game on this one. Cronos' voice is as good as singing could get back then and his bass was thundering, while Mantas' guitar tone had a very heavy sound. \n\nThe opening track \"Black Metal\" was one of the fastest songs Venom had done up until that point. It is perhaps their most popular song, and it is for a reason. It has everything people love about Venom on this one. Other honorable mentions are \"Heaven's on Fire\" which is my personal favorite on the album due to its jerky rhythm and blasphemous lyrics, and Countess Bathory, for its catchy chorus and very punk riffing. Don't Burn the Witch has some of the best riffs in Mantas' library, and S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E. is the beholder of some of the best lyrics penned by man.\n\nThis sophmore effort proved that Venom werent a one trick pony, or even a novelty act. They broadened their sound, refined it and made it still sound heavy as balls, while still retaining the catchiness that Welcome to Hell possessed. \n\nMy copy came with 9 bonus tracks, with the Die Hard single, some radio sessions and alternative versions of album tracks. Its worth your money if only for the bonus tracks because Die Hard and Bursting Out rank among Venom's best.\n",
        "\nThe birth of all extreme metal comes back to this album. There may have been heavier, better, or cleaner bands around, but all extreme metal comes back to Venom when it comes to thrash, death or black metal. Simply put, they've influenced countless bands over the years, and all of the extreme metal players owe something to Venom, be it Slayer, Morbid Angel, Possessed, Sodom, or Kreator.\n\nThis album is an assult on the senses from beginning to end. It starts out with the high speed Motorhead-esque monstrosity of Sons of Satan (just a lot dirtier and faster, not to mention more evil). The sloppy musicianship and the poor production qualities are the first thing that hits you, but they make up with it with pure energy and anarchic attitude. Songs such as Schizo and Angel Dust have very punk tones, while 1000 Days in Sodom is heavier than a bag of bricks. Witching Hour is possibly the first thrash song ever, with its punk drumming, and very metal lyrics about sacrificing virgins to Lord Satan.\n\nThis album may have been dismissed upon its release by many, but looking back on it, it is one of the most influential metal albums in the extreme metal universe. Slayer and Sodom owe everything to Venom. And with the release of a new Venom album coming late this year/next year, I can tell they are stronger than ever.\n",
        "\nVenom's third album, \"At War with Satan,\" fails to best their second and greatest album, \"Black Metal.\" But for the twenty-minute title track alone it's worth the price of admission. \"At War With Satan,\" the song is an epic metal monsterpiece of hellish proportions, a gore-soaked take of war between demons and angels. There are some awesome fast guitar riffs in this song, courtesy of Mantas, interspersed with slower and evil sounding instrumental parts and Cronos' most evil voice. Any Satanic metalhead should be very familiar with this song, and I suggest playing it while driving high-speed through the church parking lot on Sunday morning as it's aggressive as fuck. \n\nSome of the other songs don't stand up as well. I prefer the complete version of \"Manitou\" to the original album version, which was edited. This song is a great one and will get you on the warpath, let's go claim the bloodied scalps of some white men. And \"Cry Wolf\" is one of the best Venom songs ever, I don't know why this one is so obscure, a classic tale of lycanthropy. \"Woman\" has some damn cool guitar riffs, another horny Venom song. \"Genocide,\" Rip Ride\" and \"Women, Leather and Hell\" are good but hardly the band's best. \"Aaarrrggghhh\" is a total waste of tape but still quite appropriate for Venom. And overall the album was hampered by bad production so I deduct 2 points for that. I mean,all the early albums sound raw, but there are different levels of rawness.\n\nIf you are a hardcore Venom fan, you already have the re-release of this with the bonus tracks. If not, then you must ask yourself, \"Are you damned in Hell?\"\n",
        "\nHell yeah! A true NWOBHM classic, this album ups the power a notch from the excellent debut \"Welcome to Hell.\" Raw, evil and Satanic proto-black metal. The album begins with the sound of a chainsaw cutting through a metal door, and that sets the tone for the attitude of the entire album. \"Black Metal,\" the song, is a classic track, and you can hear how Venom pretty much single-handedly kicked in the early 80's thrash metal movement. Metallica, Slayer, Exodus and many more owe a debt to Venom for showing them the way to create hellish music. \n\n\nEvery track just kicks you in the balls and won't let up. \"To Hell and Back\" will actually take you there. \"Bloodlust\" and \"Countess Bathory\" are two of the greatest odes to Vampirism ever written. \"Teacher's Pet\" is hilarious, with the line 'Teacher caught me masturbating underneath the desk.\" What teenage metalhead didn't have a crush on some teacher back in the day? \"Don't Burn the Witch,\" \"Sacrifice,\" \"Buried Alive\" and \"Heaven's on Fire\" all display guitarist Mantas' ability as a riffmaster and one of the greatest guitarists in extreme metal. And the album closes with a segment of \"At War With Satan,\" the twenty-minute epic track that opens rhe band's third album fo the same name. \n\n\nIf you don't already own this album then you are a total wussy. \"Black Metal\" captures the sound of the classic (but not original! Remember vocalist Jesus Christ?) Venom lineup of Cronos, Mantas and Abaddon at the height of their power. A must have for any true metalhead or Satanist. Two horns way the f **k up, this is truly Black F**king Metal! Lay down your souls!!!!!\n",
        "\nVenom will forever be metal gods. I think that much is certain. Even with the release of their newest album, Metal Black. Venom continue to do whatever the hell they want \u2013 with no regard for fan base or even what the metal community expects from them. With this kind of state of mind, one would think the band would have drowned in a modern music industry. This is not the case. Metal Black proves it.\n\nAs soon as one pops in Metal Black, the first thought that is going to come to mind is: \u201cam I mistaken? Is this a live album?\u201d Mostly because the production value of Metal Black is so poor that even some of the diehard fans have trouble listening to it (and for clarification on this concept go back and listen to Black Metal). Venom decided that they wanted to record this album the way they recorded many of their older records. So they did \u2013 and what you hear on Metal Black is that way for a reason. \n\nThe music itself is still more in the path of their previous album, Resurrection. It\u2019s heavily riff oriented, leaning towards a groove most of the time (and sometimes it is groove \u2013 listen to House of Pain). Mykus isn\u2019t a great replacement for Mantas. Not that his work with Venom is bad but his variety when it comes to guitar writing is pretty linear and monotonous. It\u2019s heavy and it\u2019s brutal but it\u2019s lacking a lot of variety within the music itself. That was one disappointment I had, musically, with Metal Black. The second has to do with Venom drummer, Antton. \n\nAntton tore shit up on Resurrection and I was expecting no less then such on Metal Black. Unfortunately, either due to poor production (which is my guess) or poor writing, Antton\u2019s drums are less impressive this time around. They are good and do a lot of good structure work within the music \u2013 it\u2019s just not up to par with previous work. Or at least we can\u2019t hear most of the snazzy parts due to production values. \n\nVocally, Cronos is as unique as ever. His harsh borderline thrash, borderline baritone singing but all attitude. Cronos has one of the most charismatic voices in metal and he can sound legitimately evil without being death or trying too hard. Metal Black really pushes his vocals to the forefront of the battle. His vocals are the only thing that is probably produced with any kind of modern idea. There are layers with echoes and all kinds of tricks to give his vocals variety. Mostly his work on Venom never really changed vocally and it doesn\u2019t here either. Don\u2019t expect that much change.\n\nLyrically it\u2019s the same ol\u2019, same ol\u2019 Venom. I hate everything (including God, you, religion, life) and I will be violent by any means (death, shooting, fire) and I will send you to hell. That is the simplified version of most Venom songs. And yet, with that kind of lyrical theme most of it is done riding the edge of being tongue-in-cheek. That is something I find is part of my attraction to Venom\u2019s sound. I love that borderline cheese that Venom uses.\n\nOverall, Venom has \u201cproduced\u201d a strange mixture of old production values with newer song writing on Metal Black. It\u2019s definitely not for everyone. I have my complaints but I find myself listening to the album quite often \u2013 even though I find it far from perfect.\n\nSongs to check out: Antechrist, Rege Satanas, Metal Black.\n",
        "\nMost metalheads know the story behind Venom, but few could explain the post-Cronos era. When Cronos left Venom, Tony \"Demolition Man\" Dolan came in to take up bass and lead vocals. \"Prime Evil\" showed that this new line-up was able to present the same type of headbanging fury that Venom once delivered, but after \"Prime Evil,\" fans began to drift away from Venom. Once the fan base began to shrink, a new album that was just as powerful as \"Prime Evil\" was released, but has been repressed from Venom's history. \"Temples Of Ice\" is the forgotten album of Venom's legacy.\n\nVenom has always been known to put on a great guitar show. Mantas lives up to all the past expectations due to his fantastic playing. The guitar work is always thrash riffs that are nice, catchy and fast. Mantas's guitar playing takes a different turn on \"Playtime\" and \"Faerie Tale\" when his guitar riffs lean toward a more heavy metal driven sound. Mantas also displays a great deal of wild solos. Every song on \"Temples Of Ice\" has at least one solo that is always memorable and fast. The technicality of the solos show just how talented Mantas is. The solos during \"Playtime\" and \"Even In Heaven\" are the best example of this and are simply mind blowing because of all the notes he hits within just a couple seconds.\n\nThe one thing that made this album different from other Venom albums is the \nnew addition of band members. Steve \"War Machine\" White and Al Barnes played perfectly along side Mantas and the two new guitarist really helped out the overall sound. On the song \"Even In Heaven,\" they accompany the fading solo with an acoustic bridges, but the best situation is on \"Speedking\" where Mantas and War Machine copy each others solos again and again, which really makes \"Speedking\" exciting. Venom just didn't stop at the two guitarist, they even added some keyboards. New keyboardist V.X.S makes a small mark on \"Temples Of Ice,\" which is pretty dissapointing. All V.X.S does is add small samples into the songs. \"Tribes\" has a humorous sample that has a woman saying \"Oh Shit,\" and he plays this strange tango sample on \"Acid,\" but that's it; other then that, his presence is basically invisible.\n\nTony Dolan showed in \"Prime Evil\" that he could replace Cronos, and he does here as well. One thing that makes his vocal performance seem good is that his voice is very similiar to Cronos. His voice is gruff and loud, which really represents the usual Venom vocal style. The main thing that really makes Dolan amazing on this album is his flawless bass playing. From beginning to end, \"Temples Of Ice\" is loaded with bass lines. The bass is now a key part of the sound and is always audible and easy to hear. During \"Tribes,\" Dolan is playing something completely different from the guitarists and his bass is always shooting out unique sounds. The best part of his bass playing is the bass solo on \"Even In Heaven.\" Toward the end of the song, Dolan goes nuts on his bass and nails incredilne notes. Not only does his playing show how good he is, it shows his bass playing could open new doors that Cronos couldn't.\n\nI wasn't really expecting much from this album since I haven't heard too many good things about it, but I was surprised of how good it was. \"Temples Of Ice\" is sadly out of print and has been forgotten in the minds of many Venom fans. Try to find this one, it will make you happy.\n\nThis review was orginally written for: http://www.thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nThis CD is truly amazing as far as how influential it was. However, musically speaking, it's a \"satanic\" version of Judas Priest with more of an emphasis on bass and less of an emphasis on squealing vocals. It's an enjoyable listen every now and then, but truly there's nothing really fascinating to find here. The only true way to convey this CD's normality is by describing how it sounds.\n\nAlmost every song consists of a variation of essentially the same simplistic guitar riff. A two-string chord (I'm not sure the exact term for this, as I don't actually play the guitar) followed by a repeating single note for a few notes, then another chord, and the chord progression gradually evolves between single notes picked tremolo. The vocals, as stated before, are typical 80s vocals, except not QUITE as annoying as the usual - it doesn't sound like opera auditions. The drums are simple, showing an occasional glimpse of talent within the fills. Still, there's nothing too creative here, and the lyrics are quite comical. We all know that initially the Satanism in black metal was more of a joke, and most of you should know this album is not black metal. Yet, it seems like they're trying their hardest to achieve this image early on.\n\nThis CD is more or less listenable, and there's nothing overtly offensive within the sound itself, but it's not really worthwhile. You should leave your familiarity with this CD to its historical significance.\n",
        "\nVenom have been in a little slumber for the past 6 years or so. With the departure of Mantas (he's probably off being awesome and badass, as usual. I don't know the real story), I was intrigued to hear what new and/or different sounds would come out of this album. Needless to say by the score, the outcome wasn't so great. \n\nThe last release by Venom, Resurrection, wasn't bad by any standards. Not anything really great, but not bad. It was...good. I enjoyed it. Well, enjoyed it plenty more than Metal Black, that is. Anyhow - I thought this may be a continuation of the Resurrection album, but it really isn't. Compared to traditional Venom, as well as their previous release, it just doesn't stack up in any way. Metal Black ends up sounding like rehashed riffs, solos and concepts. I mean, let's face it folks, Venom have done everything there can or NEEDS to be done with their genre. This is just all the more proof we need that bands that hit their zenith in the 80s and dwindled off in the 90s before burning out in the 2000s or earlier....should NOT...DO....COMEBACK ALBUMS! Angry rhetoric about bands quitting while legendary status is upheld and not sullied with craptastic influence of the mainstream aside.... Onto the review:\n\nThe general sound of Metal Black is like..... alright, this is the best analogy I can think of at the moment, so please bear with me ... the sound is like when you throw something away, and a few days later realize that you still want it, afterall, so you have to rummage through the trash to dig it out and retrieve it. It smells bad, and is tainted, but you got it back. It's not as good as it was before, but you'd maybe like to keep it for sentimental value, or some nonsense. That's how it's like with modern Venom, and more specifically, Metal Black. It's Venom, yeah....but it's just not that good. Listeners and reviewers who score this album higher than 70 most likely only do so because they're biased and have the fanboy mindset \"HOLY CARP, IT'S FUCKING VENOM! IT HAS TO BE GOOD!\" Yeah? It may be Venom, but just because a band is legendary doesn't mean everything they produce will instantaneously be deemed GOOD. Jesus Christ. I can't stress that enough. Anyhow, the reasons exactly why Metal Black isn't too hot, are clear and simple:\n\nThe loss of Mantas's guitar work, in my opinion, greatly contributed to the harmful sounds being produced. All the riffs are stale, boring, and contrite. Like the aforementioned trash retrieval analogy ... it's as if Venom opened up a coffee can that was buried under ground for years and threw together an album from these. There's not even anything really striking or memorable about the album. I even gave it a few more listens before reviewing this to make sure it really did suck as much as I thought it did. The solos are uninspired and bland, and the constant pinch harmonics get annoying. I like pinch harmonics, like on Resurrection, but that's because they were done right on that album. On Metal Black, they just aren't. Overall, what hinders the score of this is the guitar work and originality. It's impossible for Venom to do anything new or great, because they've already done it all. There's no denying this. \n\nThe positives of Metal Black exist, yes, it's true. It's not a COMPLETELY bad release. I wouldn't necessarily buy it, but I would recommend hardcore Venom fans, or new-age richkid flash in the pan Metal fans with extra income from mommy and daddy's Visa ... to buy this one. Most people, I'd say, should avoid wasting cash. Anyhow, what I did like about this release was the vocals. Cronos still manages to sound pretty grim and such, and hasn't changed his style too much (good thing). I especially liked the track Rege Satanas, track 5. The title track is pretty cool, too. It's speedy and \"in your face.\" Other than that, I'd say there are plenty of fillers. Really unnecessary length in this one. Points received for killer vocals, and rad cover art. \n\nThe bottom line is...\n\nVenom have extended well beyond their climax in their careers. I'd say after their 3rd album is when things went downhill. And that was in 198X something...too lazy to remember * whistles * anyhow, what I'm trying to say is that Venom's originality and legendary status have already occured. They've done it. So why keep making records? Maybe teaching yoga and martial arts isn't doing it enough for them. Who knows. But it's safe to say that anything they make now from here on out, is NOT going to sound at all like what it did in the early 80s. It shouldn't be expected. Another band high up on the totem pole whose career is dying (should have died long ago), so they keep making music to cashgrab. It's been happening all too often lately, and I'm sure others agree with me. It's got to stop. Case closed. * fart noise *\n",
        "\nThe prime evil resurrection of the sons of Satan is upon us with the return of the antechrist. For nearly three decades Venom have been bursting out like a parasite from hell and back. The sleep when I'm dead attitude and live like an angel, die like a devil metal of Cronos and his legions has inspired countless Bathory incessant metal maniacs. With the onslaught of Black Metal in 1982, Venom became the most extreme metal band ever. According to Tom Angelripper, \"...After hearing Venom, Motorhead were no longer the heaviest band on the planet!\" Venom devised the term \"Black Metal\"; thereby inverting an enitre genre which would involuntarily become enslaved by their feign and vain satanic guise. Chuck Shuldiner experienced his own spiritual healing and formed Death after hearing Venom; meanwhile Slayer themselves were militant militates just south of heaven where hell awaits.\n\nIn reality, Venom were just punks from industrial England who listened to Black Sabbath, Motorhead and Judas Priest. They originated in 1978 as Oberon, then Guillotine,and later decided to call themselves Venom. Conrad \"Cronos\" Lant played bass at an infuriated pace, Jeff \"Mantas\" Dunn played grinding guitar, and Tony \"Abbadon\" Bray played dreary drums. Essentially this cult legend were inexorable hooligans with a insufferable alcoholic pendulosity. The so-called satanic manifesto was just a recusant ruse endorsed to shock and awe their folowers, and incite the authoritarians. They were like a bastardized clone of Kiss writing about everything evil, although, they had their share of sick sex songs as well. The speed and \nintensity this band played was unlike any other NWOBHM around. They invented extreme thrash metal compelling underground bands like Sodom, Bulldozer, and their ilk to persevere with 1000 days of sodomy & lust, enduring an outbreak of evil on the day of wrath. \n\nNow nearly 30 years later Venom have redounded with their latest sacrifice - Metal Black. Last year Venom dependents capitulated with bloodlust for their box set MMV. All die-hard fanatics scrimped and scruffled to obtain those recently remastered classic CDs surfeit with bonus trax. The cognomen Metal Black is a bane atonement alluding to the inverse of their leviathan - Black Metal. This time around, though, only Cronos remains as an original member. He is joined by his brother Antony \"Antton\" Lant who performed like a control freak on the Resurrection CD. On guitar is newcomer metalpunk Mike \"Mykus\" Hicky who played guitar while under the spell on the Venom CD - Calm Before the Storm and on Cronos' solo projects. With only Cronos at the helm, many critics were dismayed that Metal Black would be a detriment to the rege satanas of Venom. With a wing and a prayer, this is never the case on this powerdive. Suffer not the children, for Venom are indeed too loud for the crowd! The running time alone is the equivalent of two complete Venom releases. Venom provide the listener with a veritable banquet of comensated, comestible meat and metal.\n\nIt's been almost six years since Resurrection. This was a well-produced CD with some real burners on it. It was such an improvement over Cast in Stone with it semi-industrial tendencies. Cronos wrote some wickedly irascible and angry text and Mantas played contentiously killer guitar. On Metal Black there are two impulsive nuances . There is another line-up rotation introducing \"Mykus\" as a rookie guitarist, and there is the deliberate abominable production. The production is so muddy and thick, that it must be intentional. Venom wanted to return to their roots, and the inchoate engineering definitely resigns me to my juvenescence when I'd tolerated hiss and feedback on my original Venom tapes. This does not mean that the songwriting loses momentum. The songs are well-written with at least one ear-splitting guitar solo on every track. The drumming is genuine genocide, without ever bordering on the blast beat. Venom will never be black metal. \n\nSome stand-out track like Antechrist, Maleficarum, and the title track Metal Black sound as if they could have verily been written two decades ago. Other cuts like House of Pain and Death & Dying are more mid-paced with a crushing riff driving the pace. Cronos's vocals are deep and gruff as usual, yet still easliy understood. His purposeful articulations never digress.\nAssassin sounds like he is muttering the words ...house of sin. Cathodes like Hours of Darkness and Blessed Dead reverberate Cronos' callow drawl which is his unique signature sound. Death Metal is ill-begotten from Venom's angel dust; yet, in the war against Christ, the serpent-tongued ones will never be true death metal either. To quote Cronos, \"We come alive at the dawn of the night, we're raising hell and you know that it's right,...hear me calling - join the pack...raised in hellfire - Metal Black. This ain't no music for lighthearted folk, we tell it straight to the rich and the broke, we're long-haired punks, and we don't give a care, we turn the mayhem up, join if you dare.\".\n\nAfter all these years, Venom who set the precedent for thrash, death, and black, are placated by playing metal maelstrom with a parseltongue passion for everything contraversial. They are the imperfect braid of masterminds Motorhead, juxtaposed Judas Priest, and brooding Black Sabbath. These wanton warheads are wardens of hell. \"Omnia res malificarum sub solaris\" is the forsworn formula for those in league with Satan. Welcome to hell and the house of pain in the darkest realm, prostrate the possessed poseur before the insane assassin, for today is a good day to die in the temple of ice. The witching hour is nigh when it's calm before the storm presaging Lucifer's rising in the hour of darkness; prepare to burn in hell and lay down your souls \nbefore the gods rock 'n roll - metal ten fold through the deadly black hole!\n\nAs originally posted at www.metal-covenant.com\n",
        "\nFirst off, I admit I am no hardcore fan of Venom's. \"Welcome to Hell\" and \"Black Metal\" were a couple of pleasingly antisocial blasts of noisy thrash'n'roll, but the last time I listened to those albums was a long time ago indeed. Thus, I got \"Metal Black\" on a total whim, purely because I'd heard from others that it was a 'return to form' and my curiosity was peaked. My conclusion is that, if this is what Venom sounded like back in the day, then damn; I'm going to have to give those first two albums another listen, because this is good. Very good.\n\nNothing here is particularly original; there are no delicate acoustic interludes, pan pipes or orchestras. This is simple and beautiful; an utter cacophany of snarling riffage, relentlessly pounding percussion and facemelting solos, no frills attached. There is also a surprising amount of musical variety contained within. What I had anticipated was a bunch of songs that all sounded the same and went at the same speed, but what Venom actually produce is a series of tunes with their own identities, from the multiple tempo-changes of \"Blessed Dead\" to the slow and black grind of \"House of Pain\", to straight ahead thrashers like \"Antechrist\" or \"Metal Black\".\n\nExtra points are given for the production, which is fantastically raw and steeped in an atmosphere of chaos and black malice. Unlike many sterile modern productions, the music does not just exist; it rips from the speakers with glorious violence, a wall of bulldozing distortion, clawing ferociously at the ears. Not life-changing, not musically genius, just thrash the way it should be played - aggressive, raw and right in your face.\n",
        "\nVenom has always been one of my all-time favorite groups right after the likes of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. I\u2019ve liked something about all incarnations of the band from their badly produced beginnings to the phenomenally produced Resurrection. The band has always had an interesting complex history with a revolving door of band members rotating around the three core members Cronos, Mantas, and Abaddon. Here on Metal Black, the only remaining original member is Cronos who is joined by his drumming brother Antton (who also played on Resurrection) and guitarist Mike Hicky now going under the pseudonym Mykus (he original played on the Venom album Calm Before the Storm and Cronos\u2019s solo albums as well).\n\nLike I predicted from the slightly humorous album title, Cronos and crew here decided to go back to their roots as found on their groundbreaking 1982 album Black Metal. For some reason many bands today are deciding to go back to their roots. Going back to their old some writing ways is fine and dandy, but for some reason Cronos (you notice I didn\u2019t say Venom) decide to go back to poor recording aspects. Yes the production is very poor on this 11th Studio album and it is deliberately done to sound poor. Let\u2019s take the following for example: The Judas Priest album Sad Wings of Destiny is a great album, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want Priest to return to that poor recording style when releasing a new album. The band has matured over the years and deserves good production values. Priest went back to their old school roots on their new album Angel of Retribution. They went back to their old writing style but kept the good production. That is a \u2018back to the roots\u2019 album done right and Venom should take note. Venom\u2019s 10th studio album Resurrection was a phenomenally produced album that showcased what the band was capable of when they had proper recording techniques. This album just sounds ultra shitty and is barely audible when I play it in my car. Hell, even Welcome to Hell sounds better in my car than this rather poor excuse of an album.\n\nThe deliberate bad production isn\u2019t only odd, but the songs aren\u2019t all that hot either. I might have accepted the poor production if it resulted in some real kick ass songs. Sure Cronos and crew managed to capture the essence of the classic Venom sound, but the songs just lack substance. For this I attribute to the loss of guitarist Mantas (he hightailed it to revamp his solo career after Resurrection). Mantas was plain and simple a great guitarist when it came to writing simple but ass-kicking riffs that blew your fucking mind. Frankly, Mykus (who no doubt took that name so passive fans wouldn\u2019t tell the difference between the Mantas name) doesn\u2019t cut it. Mykus just lacks the riff writing talent of Mantas and he also isn\u2019t that spectacular of a guitar player. The Venom album and the Cronos solo albums he played on before were also weak in the guitar department. Other than the catchy opener Antechrist, the rest of the album kind of falls flat, There are no kick ass songs that match the catchiness of the original Black Metal.\n\nSome people believe Venom isn\u2019t Venom with out Cronos. Others believe the same about Mantas. I\u2019ve always been more partial to Mantas because the Venom albums that had Mantas and not Cronos have always been better than the vice versa, and this just further proves it. I do however believe Venom was at its best when Cronos and Mantas are together. Mantas\u2019s 2004 solo album Zero Tolerance lacks the Cronos aspect and this album lacks the Mantas aspect. This album also lacks the really fucking hateful songs that Mantas was always great at righting, such as Vengeance and Pain on the Resurrection album. What people don\u2019t realize is Mantas was really responsible or partly responsible for most of Venom\u2019s best and most kick ass songs. He is just a riff master. Without him, there really isn\u2019t any major kick-ass songs here. The voice may be there, but the guitar musicianship isn\u2019t.\n\nOn a final note, this was not worth a 6 year patient wait. After listening to the album straight through twice, I quickly popped Resurrection back in to remind me of what Venom was capable of. Again I don\u2019t mind Venom going back to their old song writing style, but the lackluster writing and deliberate poor production values hinders this album from becoming one of Venom\u2019s best. Cronos has always badmouthed the three Venom albums that had Mantas, Abaddon, and Tony Dolan on vocals. He just keeps putting his foot in his mouth then he himself releases Venom albums like this and Calm Before the Storm. Metal Black makes me think Mantas is the king of Venom\u2026.not Cronos. I\u2019ll just wait it out until Mantas returns\u2026\u2026hopefully.\n",
        "\n1996 was built up to be a big year for metal as it was the reunion of the original three members of Venom: Cronos, Mantas, and Abaddon. With Venom broke up after the Demolition Man years and Cronos\u2019s solo band failing, it was actually perfect time for a reunion. They kicked off the re-union with a killer tour with Slayer and the band introduced a good new song called The Evil One. Unfortunately the album that resulted wasn\u2019t the grand reunion everyone was hoping for.\n\nThe album opens with the song The Evil One, and like I mentioned before, it\u2019s a good song. It\u2019s a slower, more foreboding track. Raised in Hell and All Devil\u2019s Eve are more reminiscent of Venom of old but sadly both songs clock in Under 3 minutes. Bleeding follows and it\u2019s a rather lame track. This time however the short running time is for the listener as the lame song is over with rather fast.\n\nAfter Bleeding comes the real shocker, a song called Destroyed and Damned. The first half of this song actually played off as a balled. What the fuck!? Venom playing a ballad? Well, sort of as half way through it kicks into a thrash metal assault. Good song and an interesting experiment for the band. The next track Doomus Mundi would also be an experimental song. This time it has the band experiment with industrial sounds. WTF?! This is no doubt the result of Abaddon as he left the band after this album to start his solo Industrial band. He actually remade the song for his 2000 solo album I Am Legion except the song was re-titled Hollow Voices. I didn\u2019t mind the song but no doubt most Venom fans will be left scratching their heads.\n\nFlight of the Hydra and God\u2019s Forsaken are decent thrash tracks, but after that the album takes a real noise dive. Every song after that is basically filler. That\u2019s the problem with an album with 14 tracks as there is bound to be filler; there just seems to be more than usual on this album.\n\nAnother problem with the album is the production. Sure it\u2019s better sounding then their first albums, but still at this time in their career, Venom should be getting top notch production like Slayer. The production just sounds half-assed as if they wanted to get this album recorded and releases as fast as possible.\n\nSome versions of this album also came with a bonus disc called \u201cClassics Re-Recorded\u201d with some old Venom songs re-recorded with \u201cbetter\u201d production. Is this an attempt to make up for the lacks of the new album itself or is it just the band rewarding their die hard fans? The more I listen to the album, the more I lean towards the first part of the question.\n\nIronically I actually preferred some of Venom albums with Tony \u201cDemolition Man\u201d Dolan and Cronos\u2019s solo releases as opposed to this. This reunion album also cancelled the release of Cronos\u2019s third solo album Triumvirate which is a shame as it would have probably been better than this. Thankfully Venom returned (without Abaddon) in 2000 to record the kickass album Resurrection which makes me a little more forgiving on Cast in Stone.\n",
        "\n1982....now that was a great year for metal. We got Iron Maiden's Number of the Beast, Judas Priest\u2019s Screaming for Vengeance, Accept's Restless & Wild...and Venom's Black Metal. Black Metal may not be as \"polished\" as those other releases but it is every bit as influential....perhaps even more.\n\nBlack Metal, considered by many to be Venom's best release, is also the bands most known album no doubt because a new metal subgenre was formed from its name. This however is far from what we now consider \"black metal\" with more modern bands like Emperor and Mayhem. Venom here actually has a more thrash sound. Their lyrics, image, and stage names still fit the name \"black metal\" perfectly. Because of this I usually refer to them as a black/thrash band. Venom also seems to take themselves less seriously with a firm tongue placed in their cheek (as shown here on Black Metal). This is why I like the band so much as they can be badass but yet also have a sense of humor (check out the song Teacher\u2019s Pet for an example of this).\n\nAlso what makes Venom different from today's black metal bands is that they are so damn catchy. Mantas's riffs here on Black Metal are to the point and the lyrics are just catchy. What...a black metal album being catchy?!?! Groups like Emperor and Mayhem are great at creating a dark brooding atmosphere but lack the simple nature to create kick ass riffs and yes, catchy lyrics and courses. Almost the entire album here is catchy. You'll catch yourself singing along with Cronos on many occasions.\n\nThis catchiness is shown right off the bat with the title track opener. You'll find yourself chanting \"Lay down your soul to the god\u2019s rock 'n' roll....BLACK METAL!!\u201d Other catchy heavier tunes are Sacrifice, Countless Bathory, and Raise the Dead. Some more moody songs include the fantastic Buried Alive and Don't Burn the Witch. The album ends on a perfect note with the At War with Satan Preview which gives you a taste on what to expect on Venom's third album. That album sadly wasn't as good but the preview is great.\n\nAnother thing that is noticeable is that this album has \"better\" production than their debut...but it is still VERY rough. This \"unpolished\" production will throw some people off but it eventually grows on you. Black Metal along with their debut are must haves in any metal collection....even if you don't like Venom! If you find yourself liking these rough beginnings of the band and are curious what they sound like with better production, then I highly recommend 1989's Prime Evil and 2000's Resurrection.\n",
        "\nTo tell you the truth, I wasn't expecting anything from this album, after the disappointing Resurrection who can blame me? add to that the fact that the 90's haven't been to kind to them either. \n\nA few days earlier, I got a chance to get this album, I reluctantly picked it up, thinking that they can't do any worse... and thank the fallen one below, I was right, they didn't, they got back to their long lost (so it seemed) roots, and recorded one hell of an album. Satan himself must have produced this, I tell you the atmosphere is dark and sinister and very reminiscent of their old-school days, it is absolutely killer to say the least, believe me you'll be gasping for more than air when the riffs start buzzing and the drums start pounding.\n\nEverything is right about this album, the drumming is as it should be, tight, thunderous and precise. The riffage owns your soul and the vocals are as vicious as they come: the old school thrashy, rough vocals come through really clearly on this album. The lyrics reveal a twisted sense of humour that Venom have always been renowned for. Take my word for it, they are meant for the depraved section of society. If anyone ever had trouble getting into Venom's earlier works cause of their lack of skill and technique you first need to go to hell... and later buy this album cause they finally sound like a pretty skilled band.\n\nFor all Venom fans, this is their best effort since \"At War With Satan\"or maybe even the godly \"BLACK METAL\", for all fans of Metal, this is one killer of an album from the guys who put Black and Satan in your Metal, so fucking bow down to the return of BLACK!!!\n",
        "\nFor us record buyers back in the mid-80's, VENOM were looking more and more like a done deal after POSSESSED came out and all the poor ASSAULT releases started turing up. But every once in awhile, VENOM proved to us that they still had some serious metal to offer us. \"Canadian Assault\" is a half-live/half studio EP that offers some good stuff, although at this point most of it is available elsewhere. The studio side gives us VENOM classics \"Warhead\" (I love this slow grinder) \"Woman\" (profane!) and \"Seven Gates Of Hell\" (Slow and powerful). The live stuff is a bit less impressive due to a so-so sound job, but at least \"Die Hard\" and \"Wlcome To Hell\" sound decent. I know these ASSAULT records are very collectible these days, and newer VENOM fans might be willing to shell out big bucks to acquire them, but beware! They're often not all they're cracked up to be. But Canadian Assault is an exception to this rule, so if you can find one, GRAB IT!\n",
        "\nVenom - Black Metal. Hugely influential, supremely controversial (in two ways - people question whether they were as influential as mentioned, OR whether they were actually a totally shit joke band), and fucking noisy and satanic to the extreme. People often complain about Venom's sloppy playing, but I feel that Black Metal has excellent musicianship. Yes, excellent. It really feels like Cronos, Mantas and Abaddon improved their craft since the less-good Welcome To Hell (sorry, I don't think it's near as good as this one, though I like it). \n\nThe riffs are more intense, faster, thrashier and generally much better played on Black Metal. Mantas seems to be capable of keeping time much better on this one, whereas on Welcome To Hell he was noticeably all over the show. Abaddon, well, he's just there doing his thing. And then there are the songs, all classic and incredible minus one or two.\n\nBlack Metal...the title track. Oh. My. Fucking. God. This is a thrash explosion! That main riff will make your neck snap and your eyeballs pop out. To this day it remains one of my favourite riffs of all time, it's just...*at a loss for words* Cronos doesn't sound as unhinged as on Welcome To Hell but he's still Cronos, raw, snotty and angry like a maniacal killer with the sniffles. After the stupendous title track it's onto To Hell And Back, which seems like a less intense Welcome To Hell. It's pretty good regardless.\n\nBut Buried Alive is where it all comes together with me. UltraBoris thought it was a low-point but I find it to be the greatest of anything Venom ever did. That mourning voice reciting the funeral rites...the sound of dirt being shoveled into a grave...Cronos breathing and whispering to soft guitar...soon he gets louder and ROOAARR! AS THEY LOWER ME DOWN, INTO THAT HOLE IN THE GROUND! The lyrics read like a complete nightmare, in an absolutely brilliant way. It's infectious, bone-chilling stuff. SUMMON THE DEAD, BAPHOMET'S CALL, BLOOD ON MY HANDS, OOOOARRRGHHH!!! ...wait for it...LETTT ME OUT OF HEERREE! What follows is a truly epic solo that proves Cronos knew what to do with an axe. Cronos excels with his vocals on this one.\n\nRaise The Dead comes around to kick you in the nuts after that less energetic (though compelling) preceeding track. It's just Venom being Venom on this track...nice catchy chorus. Acid Queen kicks it up another notch, with a driving force and Cronos screaming in your ear. Then, somehow, Bloodlust bursts in and intensifies the power even MORE. Great stuff. \n\nNow, Teacher's Pet...this is a funny(erk) one about masturbating under a desk and getting caught by your teacher. Unfortunately it is too stupid to be taken seriously and suffers for it, helping a little to perpetuate the view that Venom were just clowns. This track is dumb. Pass.\n\nLeave Me In Hell picks up the ball after that drop, but is somewhat average Venom. Just a good burst of energy but not remarkable.\n\nCould go on but the rest is just more of the same...which I see as a good thing, cos I love Venom's sound. Countess Bathory is notable as an above average cut. It is easy to see why Venom were so influential with this album and they had clearly improved as song-writers and musicians. At least I feel that way. They weren't clowns, they were cool, grim pioneers with a small penchant for tounge-in-cheek that has been exaggerated by some.\n",
        "\nBack in the early 80's, Welcome to Hell was an extremely pivotal album. Lars Ulrich of Metallica even stated this album to be the very first thrash release. I hate to agree with that asshole, but I agree. It is of course still arguable, but there is no doubt that hits album is the stepping stone to thrash and black/death metal alike.\n\nThis album of course is the result of three British \"musicians\" getting together wanting to make the most in-your-face metal ever created (in the early 80's anyway). It's like they wanted to take what Motorhead started and take it not one, but many steps forward! The band took shockingly evil lyrics and mixed it with loud, heavy, and rather sloppy musicianship! I personally love the results but some people sure won't\n\nOne reason people may not like this album is because of the major rough production. I personally kind of dig it as it gives the album a unique sound. With Venom's lyrical and image choice, they're actually lucky to get this recorded at all! Most production studies would have frowned on their musical choice so it's a \"miracle\" that Welcome to Hell was even recorded!\n\nThe album kicks off with Sons of Satan, an extremely thrashy track. Right away people new this wasn't your average Motorhead rip-off! These guys were for real! All the songs present on this album have, for lack of a better word, great \"groove\" to them that is extremely different than the black metal the band would inspire in the future. What surprising is that even with the albums poor production, many of the songs have very sing-along-able courses! Try listening to Live Like an Angel with singing the course along with Cronos. \"Live like an angel, die like a devil, got a place in hell reserved for me. Live Like an angel, die like a devil, gonna burn in hell it's where I want to be!\" Ouch!! \n\nSome people slat Venom for not having musical talent, but that is harsh. Sure they may not be the best metal musicians in the genre but they deserve MUCH more credit then they get. First of all the production doesn't help in this case. Listen to some of Venom's later releases such as Prime Evil or Resurrection for proof. Mantas is actually quit a good guitarist and Cronos has a likeable voice that fits this time of \"in-your-face\" metal music perfectly!\n\nIf you are a metal fan, then Welcome to Hell needs to be in your collection! If you can get past the rough production, than Welcome to Hell may very well be to your liking (especially if you\u2019re a thrash nut!).\n",
        "\nAt fist listen, the first thing that came up and kicked me in the balls was how good the production was. Now we're not talking high class production values as with today's bands, but compared to Venom's first two ultimately cool but poorly produced gruesome twosome, this sounds pretty damn good. \n\nThe album kicks off with the surprisingly long title track. This baby is almost 20 minutes in length (when released on LP, the song actually took up the entire first side)! This was very ballsy for the band! The song is surprisingly good with an \"interesting\" story within its lyrics. The story has some demons heading up to heaven to take the place down. They severely beat up angels who at once they recover from getting their asses kicked then head down to hell to take out the demons. Yes, it is one fucked up story that only could be dreamed up by the demonic minds of Venom. The song is surprisingly well structured, considering the bands rather poorly (but still cool) structured origins. I did like the song very much but I do have to say that at 20 minutes in length, it does get a little long. Even cutting it down to 13 minutes would have been sufficient enough. One of my favorite moments of the song is the ending when it has a narrator talking over the song. It's so chilling it will give you goosebumps!!\n\nSince the first song is so long, sadly the rest of the album really just acts as filler. Sure there is some decent material, but it really is just \"there\" per say. Of the six tracks that follow the monster opener, Rip Ride would have to be the best. It's just balls-to-the-wall heavy metal that Venom known for. The album closer is humorously titled Aaaaaaarrghh but sadly it doesn\u2019t live up to its funny name. It's mostly just talking. To show off the bands unique sense of humor, they announced that the third \"a\" in the title is silent. HAHAHA!! That's why I love Venom! They can be scary, aggressive, yet they also have that great British sense of humor (whoops, I mean humour)\n\nThe album cover itself was a real \"shocker\" at the time that would make any parent majorly pissed at their child. Though some found it shocking, I personally found the cover to be actually humorous. I could just picture the band members just sitting around, drinking and playing cards trying to think up another way to be shocking. One member goes \"how about we make the album cover have the texture of the bible and print an inverted cross on it!\" Hey, what can I say, it worked as most people I know remember the album cover more than anything.\n\nOverall I don't view this album to be as good as or better than Welcome to Hell or Black Metal. Though it's not as good, I still viewed it as a step in the right direction evolution wise. The reason for this is of course for the much improved production values as well as the better song writing capabilities that the band proved with the title song. Sadly Venom would not continue with this trend as they de-evolved with their pivotal but extremely disappointing release of Possessed.\n\nMore interesting Venom releases to come later...\n",
        "\nI will tell you right off the bat that I did not like the Venom album Possessed. It was a poorly produced, poorly written album from a band that was out of ideas and foaming at the mouth from rage at each other. It was like that the group decided to de-evolve to a degree. A very poor album.\n\nTo coincide with the release was the the Nightmare single, a single featuring a song that was not part of the tracklisting on the album. Since this was released at the same time as that dismal album, and for the fact that the artwork is dreadful, I went into this expecting the worst. To my surprise I got a song that was good! Hell this is the best Venom song since the release of the Black Metal album! \n\nThe production is slim, but somehow it sounds better than the material present on Possessed. It's got a catchy course and a nice riff. I couldn't believe they only left this song as a single and didn't put it on the album! It would have made the album, not saveable, but more stomachable if it were present. \n\nThankfully on the new remastered version of Possessed by Castle/Sanctuary records, Nightmare is added as one of its many bonus tracks. Now I have a reason to stick that album into my CD player afterall!\n",
        "\nThe worst thing that can happen to a group is when a singer leaves, especially when the singer was an original founding member and really aided to the groups unique sound, such as with Cronos. Only in a few instances does a singer change result for the better (Iron Maiden w/ Bruce Dickinson, Kamelot w/ Khan). Most end up mediocre or a disaster disaster (Accept, Maiden w/ Blaze). So was Venom with a new singer the train wreck as expected? I would have to say not.\n\nWhats a shame is that most old Venom fans will go into the album Prime Evil with pre-conceived notions that the album will suck, or won't even listen to the album at all. This is a shame because frankly, Cronos wasn't Venom. He was only 1/3 Venom. Two founding members Mantas and Abaddon remained so all cannot be bad.\n\nThe new singer, Tony \"Demolition Man\" Dolan, though he might not have as unique or attitude filled voice as Cronos, but he does a commendable job. Frankly, I cannot think of one other singer out there that could have done as good of job filling Cronos's shoes.\n\nNot only is the new singer decent, but so is the album. Most of you that heard the bands previous album Calm Before the Storm remember that the band was faltering with their identity and frankly, Prime Evil is a step back on track. The album, however, is taken more serious than the classic albums of the bands past. Though I love their first albums (Welcome to Hell through Possessed), the band with their outrageous image, over-the-top lyrics, and poor production habits always seemed to be a little tongue-in-cheek. On Prime Evil, however, the band seems to be taking themselves seriously. The songs, for the most part, are darker and serious, with out totally abandoning the Venom sound of the past. The production is also crisp and clear, far better sounding than anything the band has recorded in the past.\n\nThe album opens with the title track and it is probably the albums best known song, though I find it to be a decent song, it is far from the album's best. It's the intro to the song that becomes annoying as it sounds like a fax coming through your phone line. The next track Parasite, is much better. It's a faster, more aggressive track reminiscent of Venom of old. The third track Chanting of the Priest was actually written by Dolan and ends up being one of the albums best tracks. The songs begins with religious chanting and then the foreboding dark lyrics begin. Great song. The songs Carnivorous and Harder Than Ever are also two more great classic sounding Venom tracks. Skeletal Dance, Insane, and Into the Fire, though decent, are probably the albums weakest cuts. Megalomania is a is a major kick ass Black Sabbath cover. Some people complain that the band cut out the atmospheric intro to the song, but I was OK with it. They got write to the meat and potatoes of that classic Sabbath track that to my knowledge has never been covered by any other band. The album closes with the song Skool Daze. It is a follow-up to the classic Venom song Teacher's Pet and it continues the story of Mantas's teacher sex obsessed fantasies. The lyrics are hilarious. It is the only joke track on the disc. The CD version contains the bonus track Live Like An Angel - Die Like A Devil, which is a re-recording of the classic Cronos song. Some fans might find this blasphemous, but hey, its a bonus so get over it. \n\nFor those fans that are stiff minded that Venom is Cronos and only Cronos, then this review will not convince them. There is no changing their minds. If your a fan that is open minded but still have doubt that Venom can exist without Cronos, then make sure to pick up Prime Evil as you will find out that you cannot deny the the contributions Dolan made with the band. Prime Evil is a terrific album that deserves to be discovered.\n",
        "\nWell they got back together, the classic lineup, and put together 14 songs for Cast in Stone. Now I always get a bad impression when a metal band has more than 10 songs, because that usually means filler. Well I was right to think that. But they sure did put out some good material for once since \u201985. This isn\u2019t the thrashy Venom like back in the day. This is a tad bit slower more brutal riffage. Normally I would be like \u201cGreat they\u2019ve slowed down like all the others, its probably shit\u201d but I gave it a chance and I don\u2019t regret it. There are still some fast thrashers like \u201cRaised in Hell\u201d and \u201cFlight of the Hydra.\u201d But the majority is crushing metal that\u2019s definitely far from the black metal label they got tagged with. Is this really the same production team as back in the day for Welcome to Hell?? This production sounds awesome. The sound is mammoth like and so is the song writing. But another thing redeemable about the album is its diversity.\n\nRight from the beginning that guitar opening just reels you in for a 3 minute midtempo crusher. Evil One pretty much gives you a definite feel for the album. Other midtempo ones are Destroyed and Damned, Bleeding, and Kings of Evil. Bleeding goes in between slow verses (\u201cBleeeeeeeeeeding\u201d) to faster sections, both of which have great riffs. Destroyed and Damned starts out\u2026.. quite odd. It has some emotive guitar work with a somber spoken part. It seems almost like a depressive ballad until about 2 minutes into it and it becomes an extremely heavy slow song. \n\nKings of Evil starts out with just Cronos playing a little rhythm on bass then adds vicious vocals. After a while the rest of the band joins in with an unholy high scream. It picks up the pace with the chorus but gets kind of boring. A couple of the best songs are the faster ones Raised in Hell, and Flight of the Hydra. Raised in Hell just slaps you in the face after Evil One and leaves you breathless afterwards. Flight of the Hydra starts out with cool guitar work and then goes into a very fast part chaotic part, also a great chorus. Highlight of the album.\n\nNow with the good comes the mediocre\u2026 and sometimes shit. Like Swarm. Honestly this is one horrible attempt at atmosphere with stupid electronics thrown in. Domus Mundi also starts out with some sequenced sample of percussion. Gods Forsaken, Mortals, and Your All Gonna Die are all forgettable and could have been left out. So it could have been an awesome 9 song album but this is forgivable to an extent.\n\nWell that was a trip\u2026 wait a sec there\u2019s a whole second disc. The second disc is a collection of lesser known Venom classics redone in the studio. It starts out with their opener \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, from the very depths of Hell\u2026 VENOM!!!\u201d and then goes into a very nicely done version of Bloodlust. They go through some other good songs like Acid Queen, Warhead, Manitou, and Venom. They songs pretty much remain the same except with definitely better production.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend Cast in Stone to anybody wanting to get into Venom. This is mainly for Venom fans but it\u2019s a very nice deal, with the added second disk and a nice package including a mini poster, pentagram and all. Highlights are Evil One, Raised in Hell, Bleeding, and Flight of the Hyrda. Venom fans rejoice.\n",
        "\nFuck all of you \"anti-Dolan\" bastards. This is a killer release, and you know it.\nThe production is damn solid, you can hear everything and the timbre is just perfect. The best production Venom had up to that point and possibly since. \n\nMantas returns to the fold (only because Dolan and he were friends and Tony convinced him to come back) and brings with him the Venom name, which I understand was his idea to begin with. Abbadon is as sloppy as ever, and if you listen to this one as much as I have you can hear some clumsy punch-ins here and there. The bass solos are fkn great (tell me that the bass solo on \"Blackened Are the Priests\" isn't one of the top 10 coolest Venom moments on record...you can't.) Dolan rips out his own lungs and shows them to you. Mantas does some of his career-best solos on this one. One half old chainsaw Jeff and one half \"I really CAN play\" Jeff on here. Dolan wrote more than half the songs on this record by himself, well before Jeff came back, so the quality is pretty damned high. Legend has it, actually, that the ever-smarmy Abbadon actually got a deal with Music For Nations using the demos from \"Calm Before the Storm\" even though it was just him in the \"band\" and neither Dolan nor Mantas were aboard when the contract was signed.\n\nThe bad? Well, \"Megalomania\" takes down this release for me by 20 points. However the cover of \"Live Like an Angel\" on the CD version (only, my LP does not have it) tacks on an additional 10. This song is just not very good. Apparently Abbadon convinced Mantas that this was an ORIGINAL as he had never heard the Sabbath song. Ouch. Lose 10 Metal God points there, Jeff. And, well, I don't like the \"keyboard\" interlude on the title track. The live version where Dolan plays a bass solo of the same melody makes more sense to me.\n\nMantas has apparently said that the only four Venom albums he considers up to snuff are \"Welcome to Hell,\" \"Black Metal,\" \"Prime Evil\" and \"Ressurection.\" So there. Abbadon has also mentioned that if \"Prime Evil\" had come out right after \"At War With Satan\" things would have been huge.\n\nGet it. You can spare the 7$ it will cost you new.\n\n\"How they writhe in pain! Padded room of doom, INSANE!\"\n",
        "\nThis is a pretty good comp from the Mark II lineup of Venom with Tony Demolition Dolan on bass and vox. There are unreleased songs from the MkII lineup (recorded just after \"Wastelands\" sessions) like \"Fragile Life\" and \"Surgery\" that are pretty good. There are also studio versions of classics like \"Bloodlust\" and \"Witching Hour\" that are pretty good and not the easiest to find with this lineup. Then there are the same old \"Live '90\" video tracks that are once again trotted out and they are again, fine. I personally like this one the best out of the \"MkII Comps\" that there are about a dozen of, as it has the most to offer beyond live tracks from the same vid and re-edits of the \"Temples\" and \"Wastelands\" albums. This was a pleasant find when I got it some years ago from Amazon and I recommend it to fans of the MkII lineup.\n\n\"Surgery! The Cure for all ills! Surgery! One mistake can kill! Surgery! Flesh under the knife! Surgery! Fighting for your life!\"\n",
        "\nThis is a rehearsal recording with the Prime Evil lineup with Demolition Dolan on bass and vocals. The production is not the best, but it's OK. The worst part is that Tony's bass is non-existent. So that renders parts like the bass solo on \"1000 Days in Sodom\" completely worthless. On the plus side, this is a band that is finding their feet again after the embarassing (even though on a cheese level I kind of like it) \"Calm Before the Storm\" album. They are raw, hungry, pissed off, and are more in the neighborhood of the Newcastle punks they started out as. Don't get me wrong, I cannot compare this to the first two Venom LPs (and neither would Mr. Dolan, I'll have you know) but this is a nice little release for people that like this lineup and the \"Live '90\" video as there are several songs here that did not make it on the video. I have a bootleg of a German show that includes some of these \"extra\" songs, but the quality is not great so it's nice to kind of get the feel what this lineup did with them. If you spot it on Ebay or can get it for around 10$, it would be worth it.\n",
        "\nAfter the disappointing album Possessed and Mantas hightailing it to pursue a solo career, remaining members Cronos and Abaddon recruit two guitarists to take his place. With a new line-up in place, Venom would march into the studio and record their fifth studio album Calm Before the Storm. \n\nWith this release, Venom (or what I've read from interviews, Cronos) decided to do some experimenting. Unlike Possessed where the music sounded worn-out, redundant and de-evolved, Storm does the total opposite and goes too far into left field and in the process Venom alienated a lot of their fans. Cronos and crew threw most of their \"black metal\" sound out the window for a more upbeat traditional simplistic thrash sound. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't mind when bands experiment (unless its Metallica). Without bands changing their sound or experimenting, we wouldn't have stellar albums like Iron Maiden's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son or Judas Priest's Painkiller. But Venom's experiment...well...I guess it might have been better if the songs overall were better. \n\nWhat really hurts album is the songs aren't that great. The new \"sound\" might have been more stomach-able if it produced some killer tracks. The only real standouts are Black X-Mas, Chanting of the Priests, and the title track, but that's about it. These songs are only memorable because of some catchy courses and some good rhythms. Black X-Mas, probably the albums best track, is far too short clocking in at just under the 3 minute mark. This only adds salt to an already open wound. \n\nThe rest of the songs are just simple and unmemorable. Metal Punk is an attempt at a \"punk\" metal song, and it fails. Under a Spell, Krakin' Up, Beauty and the Beast, Deadline, Gypsy, and Muscle all suffer from mediocrity with poor to silly lyrics and a considerable lack of good guitar solo's. It's sad to say but after listening to this album, I can see where Venom sorely misses Mantas's guitar talent and song writing abilities. Many people might be unaware but Mantas was responsible for most of Venom's more memorable and kick-ass songs from their earlier releases and without him, the band seems lost. \n\nThe one really good thing is that Venom finally got decent production as there is no comparing the production of Storm and Possessed when it comes to production quality. Sadly, just because an album has decent production doesn't necessarily make it good, as with the case here. \n\nFans retaliated against the album and Cronos knew it, so he took Mantas's replacements and jumped ship to record some solo albums where he would continue to refine this new \"sound\", and I have to admit, he did crafted the sound better in his solo efforts (He would even re-record the song \"Fire\" for his solo compilation creatively titled \"Venom\") \n\nWill die hard fans like this CD? Most probably won't but there are a few fans like me that will find at least a few songs too like here. \n\nCalm Before the Storm...another entry into Venom's interesting and complex history as a heavy metal band. More interesting entries would come later.... \n\nIt should also be mentioned that Storm has been re-released numerous times sometimes under different tiles and covers. Make sure to steer clear of the versions released under the names Metal Punk and Beauty and the Beast as they are cheap issues with silly cover art and considerably lower sound quality. Either get the original Neat Records release with the original lightning bolt cover or the Deadline re-issue with some sort of weird man/cat creature on the cover.\n",
        "\nI don't care what other Venom fans say, 1989's Prime Evil was an excellent Venom release. The production was clean and the band seemed to be rejuvinated and full of great ideas and aggression. Vocalist Tony Dolan was also seemed to be a fitting replacement for Cronos. Reviews at the time even stated \"Cronos has been put to bed\". Prime Evil could have been a new beginning to a bright future for the band...\n\n...and then came 1991's Temples of Ice.\n\nThe first problem with Temples of Ice is the production. The production is muddy and Dolan's vocals seem distant. The songs themselves are considerably weaker than what was present on Prime Evil. Some decent ones like Tribes and In Memory of, but all the rest seem to fall flat. The song Playtime was supposed to be the third song in Mantas's teacher obsessed series (first songs being Teacher's Pet and Skool Daze) but it doesn't come near the silly charm as the other songs in teh series.\n\nAnother problem is the lame cover art. The Venom logo portrayed as shattering ice was an interesting idea, but the the drawn beast on the cover is just bad. Looks like some moster with huge eyeballs and and teeth being crushed by some metal bar. Whatever it is, Abaddon should be ashamed of himself for slapping on such a dreadful piece of art on a Venom album cover\n\nAs with Possessed, Venom failed at an opportune moment where they needed to release a steller album. The bands follow-up The Waste Lands was better, but still nothing the band was capable of and again the band faded into oblivion.\n",
        "\nMany people think Calm Before the Storm is where Venom screwed up. Actually where Venom tripped up is two years before with the 1985 release of Possessed, the bands fourth album.\n\nEverybody knows Venoms legendary first two albums Welcome To Hell and Black Metal. Though Primative sounding with limited production, there were excellent early thrash/black metal records. The band would make a step forward with the release of At War With Satan. That album featured better production and the band even toyed with progressive song writing. It was a little different than their previous two albums but none-the-less, it was the step in the right direction.\n\nThen came Possessed....\n\nAfter showing a promising future with At War With Satan, the band missed their mark with their next release. Possessed emerged as de-evolution of the band and was a marginal step down from AWWS. The production was again ruduced to poor methods with Cronos's vocals taking the blunt of it. The songs themselves seemed to suffer and they just lacked punch. Part of the blame could be the internal struggles the band was going through at the time. Guitarst Jeff \"Mantas\" Dunn has even described his disappointment with the album in interviews. He was so upset with the album at the time that actually departed from Venom to pursue a solo career. \n\nPossessed also wasn't well recieved by fans and the bands Venom inspired were passing them on by. Slayer, Metallica, and Megadeth were all releasing excellent ablums at the time such as Hell Awaits, Ride the Lightning, and Killing Is My Business, all of which are miles ahead of Possessed.\n\nI think this was a pivital time for Venom. If they were able to release a killer album, they might have became as big as the above mentioned bands. With the lackluster release of Possessed, its no wonder they faded into oblivion in the late 80's...\n\nEven with all the negatives surrounding the album, its still will be among interest to metal fans as it really was the last album of the classic era of Venom and the last album to feature the original line-up until the 1996 reunion album Cast in Stone.\n",
        "\nThere is probably no underground band that has more oddball collection discs than Venom. Hit that \u2018back\u2019 button and just look at that list in the archives. Most of these collections sling together everything from stuff you can find on any Venom lp to unearthed demo tracks and reworked versions to Mantas eating and Abaddon mowing his lawn while humming a Carpenters tune. Anything that a buck can be made on, and unless there\u2019s something special to be had, I usually don\u2019t bother, but what makes this nifty little collection above and beyond the other two dozen or so are tour intro tapes, television adverts and radio station visits. Sure, there\u2019re some unreleased tracks that are always dandy for any behemoth Venom fan, plus some remixes, but my real interest were the non-musical features. \n\nThe cd starts most aptly with the tour intro tape from \u201883/\u201984, right about the time At War With Satan was bearing down on the world. If you\u2019ve ever been to an early Venom show or saw one of their VHS concerts, you\u2019ve heard this. Thunder clashes in massive waves and demons howl and cry as \u201cLadies & gentlemen, from the very depths of hell\u2026Venom!\u201d does what it\u2019s supposed to and right into a remixed, cleaner version of \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d. The intro tape of \u201885/\u201986 harks the coming of their Possessed album, stark scary white with chimes, little English children speaking in tongues with a creepy, overlapping effect when they\u2019re not screaming for their lives, and is later punctured by the remix of \u201cPossessed\u201d. There are a bunch of radio spots (for the USA and Spain) that amplify the band\u2019s penchant for goofing around, the three of them yelling like a gaggle of drunken sailors out for a good time, dispelling some of their fa\u00e7ade as the most malevolent band in the void, but anyone fairly familiar with Venom\u2019s style is aware the crew don\u2019t take themselves or each other very seriously. Believe it or not, this is the true gift of Venom. Geese will perform linear algebra before anyone will see members of Marduk or Satyricon striking Victoria Secrets poses like Cronos does on the inner fold-out (with Abaddon licking his nipple while Mantas gayly smiles as if this is something that happens everyday). It\u2019s great to hear the t.v. adverts for At War With Satan with that same commanding voice-from-above that intros their shows. \n\nFor musical features, we\u2019ve got previously unreleased tracks \u201cDead on Arrival\u201d (a fairly powerful number with some screaming solos and catchy riffs), \u201cSnot\u2019s Shit\u201d (from an unreleased demo, super sloppy punk with no motive except slapstick), \u201cHounds of Hell\u201d (straightforward and typical Venom), \u201cBitch Witch\u201d (a number that mixes a mid-pace with a light plod highlighting the chorus), and \u201cSadist (Mistress of the Whip)\u201d (a cool track in the vein of \u201cS.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E.\u201d with a short, but lively chorus). As well as these gems, there\u2019s the Abbey Road uncut mix of \u201cManitou\u201d, generally the same except for a couple light sound effects and an extended ending that is nothing special. Then there are the band\u2019s first recordings, crude legendary demo versions of \u201cAngel Dust\u201d, \u201cRaise the Dead (with different lyrics)\u201d, and \u201cRed Light Fever\u201d without the attitude injection they will later receive. \n\nBetween the newly unearthed stuff, the industry fun, and the demo material (if you've never heard it), I believe this is worth the bucks. Not a Venom fan? Not only wouldn\u2019t you be wasting a minute of your day reading this, you'd probably have more interest in rust or the Great Hippopotamus Migration of 1842.\n",
        "\nFirst off, this is only an EP, not an album. The EP is also geared towards die hard Venom fans by giving them some unique, previously unreleased material, which it does, and good material I might add.\n\nThe EP kicks off with Skool Daze, a previously released studio track off of the album Prime Evil. This is one of Venoms ever lovable joke tracks much in the vein of Teacher's Pet off of Black Metal. The lyrics are just hilarious! The track fades into a live version of of the song Burstin' Out. Burstin' Out is the first of three live tracks on this EP. The others are Angel Dust and Hellbent and all three tracks were recorded during the filming of the Live '90 video. Hellbent is a cover of Judas Priests Hell Bent for Leather with the lyrics changed to \"hell bent for metal\", which I found humerous. The live tracks were unique, though not drawdropping, and it was interesting hearing Tony \"Demolition Man\" Dolan singing some of the old Cronos material.\n\nThe real kicker on this EP is that it contains two previously unreleased studio tracks entitled The Ark and Civilized, which are actually two of my most favorite Venom songs from the Dolan era. The Ark is about none-other than Indiana Jones. With that cinematic hero being the subject matter of the song, you would expect it to be hokey, but its not. It's actually a rather haunting track and Dolan's vocals go perfectly with the song. Civilized is more of a traditional Venom sounding song that was even performed live on the Prime Evil tour. \n\nMy one complaint is the ludicrous cover with Dolan in poor makeup with tubs and chains pulling him apart. It just looks silly and cheap.\n\nOverall this EP does what it was ment to: gives likeable, unique material to the Venom fans of the world. If your a die-hard venom fan and also like Dolan on vocals, then this EP will make a welcome spot on your CD shelf. The 2 unreleased studio tracks alone make this EP worth owning.\n",
        "\nOut of all 10 Venom studio albums (Welcome to Hell through Resurrection), The Waste Lands seems to be the album that people forget about. It doesn't help that this is by far the hardest album of theirs to obtain, but also that its not overally all that memorable. Not saying its bad, it just seems to fade from memory. \n\nUnlike what seems to the majority of Venom \"fans\", I actually liked Tony Dolan on vocals. Yes I like Cronos but I'm not the kind of fan that will automatically write the band off just for the simple fact Cronos isn't on Vox. Check out Prime Evil, Dolan's first Vocal performance with the band. That was a tight, well constructed Venom thrash album. The second album with Dolan entitled Temples of Ice, wasn't so hot, but again it wasn't Dolan's fault. That album suffered from poor production and lackluster songs. The Waste Lands, Dolan's third and final performance with the band, improves a bit on Temples.\n\nFirst of all, the songs are better. Cursed is one of those \"atmospheric\" but passable intros that leades up to the steller track I'm Paralized, one of the best on the CD. Wolverine, Kissing the Beast, and Riddel of Steel are some standout cuts. As a whole, the album isn't bad and is enjoyable, but like I said before, not memorable. It definitely won't knock you socks off, but for a thrash loving fanatic, this will garner a welcomed spot on any CD shelf, it's just a shame its so hard to obtain and some fans like me greatly want the Dolan era albums to be re-released. But since it seems that a great number of fickle Venom fans don't like the Dolan releases and that Cronos is now the only remaining original Venom member now in the group, rereleases of these forgotten albums doesn't look to bright....\n",
        "\nUninspired... a complete fucking wreck. There is basically nothing favourable to be said about this silly little EP, especially when considering that this is FUCKEN VENOM that released this. Ya know... \"lay down yer souls, to the Gods rock 'n roll\". I have no idea where else some of these songs appear, but the whole thing seems like a hastily produced pile of slop... the record label needed an EP, the band coughed up some random tracks, repackaged some others, and hey check it out we've got ourselves an EP... in order of increasing quality: a badly done old song, some new shit, a well done old song, and a cover song.\n\nThere are three \"new school Venom\" originals here... Skool Daze, The Ark, and Civilised... Civilised is actually not all that terrible, but it is oh-so-uninspired, sounding like a demented mid-80s Judas Priest on valium (and besides, it rips off Vendetta's Suicidal Lunacy). Same with The Ark, which randomly fades out - you can just see the record exec holding up the \"YOU CAN STOP PLAYING NOW\" sign. No spirit. No life. No class. \n\nOh yea and Skool Daze is complete fucking shit. It's supposed to be Teacher's Pet II but it completely misses on the menace, the lecherous attitude, the ... everything ... of the original. Stupid 12-bar blues bullshit. Makes no sense.\n\nThen we've got the first of the live songs... Bursting Out - this isn't on any of the early Venom LPs, but it's on all of them - it's the ubiquitous bonus track, and it's a staple of KVLT VENVM, except here it just sounds horribly forced... the band plays oversloppy and tries too damn hard. \"Thrash it up\". The drums are mistimed, the guitars are barely audible, so you'd think this was fucking classic... yet the whole thing completely lacks the effort of the original VENOM. It's like a bunch of Nirvana members got themselves high on coke and formed a Venom cover band or something. That is what this sounds like. A copout, a waste of time, etc.\n\nThe last two tracks are the highlight of this oddly polished turd... an okay version of Angel Dust (another classic) - this time the guitars are audible, and hey it ain't bad... then a cheesy cover of Judas Priest's Hell Bent for Leather (inexplicably retitled \"Hell Bent for Metal\") which actually comes off as amusing, and barely, in some bizarre manner, has the old spirit of KVLT AS FVCK Venom. Sloppy as shit, and forgetting half of the lyrics, barely keeping up with the riffage... cheesy backup vocals, completely offkey foreground vocals... but somehow, somehow this just manages to come up with what Venom is and means. Oh yea and they, surprisingly, NAIL the solo. Which is something not even Tipton can claim half the time. Heh. That just adds to the perfection - they don't nail anything else, but that insane solo that is the trademark of the song, they gotta get that one right, so they do.\n\nBut overall... the only thing to recommend this album is someone else's song... really, it's just not worth the effort. It's a huge pile of commercial cheese. Look at the damn album cover... it was bad when Exciter unveiled the wicked. This one's even worse.\n",
        "\nIn a time back in the early 80's, the band known as Venom were well known for their live performances and extreme image in everyway. Labeling their creation as black metal, Venom literally was known for playing without any form of musicianship and shouting blasphemous lyrics. Covering their albums with pentagrams, goats, etc. Their shocking image also brought to them a wide variety of people in their fan base.\n\nVenom definately carry the NWOBHM sound. The guitar work easily can be remind the listener of motorhead. With the constant chugging riffs and grunting vocals. Occasionally the vocals go into a whisper like on the song \"Buried Alive\". The drumming on this album is pretty generic which really takes away from the album.\n\nThe album doesn't have as dark and atmospheric feel as later black metal albums such as Bathory's Selftitled, \"The Return\", \"Under the sign of the black mark\" or Hellhammers \"Satanic Rites\" or \"Apocalyptic Raids\". It's more like a bunch of teenagers having a great time and writing blasphemous lyrics. Overall that feel for this album is much like most other heavy metal classics with a darker form of lyrics. Any black metaller needs to hear this album. An album which at the time was probably thought just another metal album has now become a timeless classic\n",
        "\nRarely do I give any form of compilation any kind of notice as most are simply marketing gimmicks by record companies to gain an extra buck out of the passing fan. This double CD set from Venom though, contains many rare songs, alternate versions of fun variations to justify it's existence. The artwork contains many great photos, an article, and good attention to details that many Venom compilations lack showing that someone actually CARED about this project. (Thankfully they avoided including terrible tracks like \"Shit Snot\" and \"Bitch Witch\" as well.) This is a perfect cross-section for anyone who wants to try Venom...or wants a few rare songs to drag into the collection.\n\nThe key inclusions on this record are a wonderful live recording of \"Countess Bathory\", the usual 'hits' like \"Die Hard\" and \"Ride Ride\" along with odds and ends that many may have overlooked over the bands career like the pounding \"Dead of Night\" and the hilarious \"Woman\". The production varies per track of course, but the band deliver their caustic poison again and again with little attention to musical concentration - only over the top violence and attitude. Bonus points for the ultra-heavy rendition of \"Buried Alive\" as well!\n\nVenom were a band that makes little sense, but rock beyond words all the same. Probably the worst metal musicians on earth, they crafted perfect hooks and made more \"fun\" music (in the most aggressive and violent sense) than any band before them.\n\nVenom are just that...some of us simply like the poison.\n\nhttp://www.venomslegions.com\n",
        "\nWith it's chaotic, backwards introduction, into the pounding drums, the instantly recognisable guitar riff, and Cronos' distorted vocals, this is the greatest song Venom have ever written.\n\nBeing a huge inspiration for just about all future black metal bands, and especially the second wave, it's the music like this that spawned the darkest genre around. And, also featuring some of the greatest lyrics ever put to paper, this song is really that good. A brilliant pre-chorus which flows perfectly into the chorus, which is a chant-a-long, 'EEEVIIIIL IN LEAGUE WITH SATAN!!'\n\nThe second song on here, starts off with a short guitar feedback introduction, and then bursts into a huge Motorhead-style riff. Even the vocals sound like Lemmy. This song wouldn't be out of place on Ace Of Spades, really, except of course for the lyrics, which focus on having a place in Hell reserved for the singer. Again, more great instrument playing, despite it not being technical at all.\n\nWhen I think of the greatest Venom single, I think of this. And when I think of favourite Venom song, I think of In League With Satan. Absolutely brilliant.\n",
        "\nThe first album from Venom at first comes off a simply a prelude to the riff machine \"Black Metal\", but upon closer inspection, \"Welcome to Hell\" stands alone as a solid speed/heavy metal album. To be fair, the only black metal thing about the album is the lyrics, which are evil and blasphemous, and possibly the album's best song, Witching Hour. \n\nThere is a lot of midpaced stuff on here, such as the title track, which sounds strangely like \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" (well, at least that main riff). However, despite the slower elements, they still proceed to kick the listeners ass with morbid sounding gutteral bass lines and guitar blasts. Cronos had the most evil vocals at the time, producing not quite a growl and not quite a voice, one has to hear it for themselves.\n\nFavourite songs on the album for me include \"Sons of Satan\", which is a quick paced thrashy number, featuring some surprisingly good solo work. \"1000 Days in Sodom\" is another classic, with an absolute fucking killer of an opening riff and some pretty damn cool lyrics. Despite the aforementioned songs' greatness, \"Witching Hour\" takes the cake as not only the best song on here, one of the best Venom songs ever! Beginning with a gutteral bass line, then into a riff that provides plently of satanic imagery. Follow this up with Cronos' growling (ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!!) and you have a true classic!\n\nI suggest this album to any fans of Venom and thrash, just don't expect the rawer black metal sounding stuff that you get on the album of the same name.\n",
        "\nWell folks, the double Venom LP of a lifetime. Two CD\u2019s filled to the brim with well-recorded (yet shoddily mastered) tracks spanning the first wave of blasting Venom. This record is taken from two shows (the Hammersmith Odeon show from 1985 and the New York Ritz show from 1986) and represents Black Metal's first master-blasters quite well. \n\nThe first disc is the stronger of the two (featuring a better recording and better mastering) with it\u2019s blasting renditions of \u201cThe 7 Gates of Hell\u201d, \u201cLeave me in Hell\u201d, \u201cNightmare\u201d, the classic \u201cCountess Bathory\u201d and a SLAYING \u201cDie Hard\u201d. Only the track \u201cToo Loud for the Crowd\u201d leaves me feeling less than unholy. Each song shows the classic Venom sound (best described as Black Sabbath meets Judas Priest's guitar wanderings meets a jackhammer being channeled through the blood gargle of Motorhead) in fine form with even drummer Abaddon holding his own with the solid and aggressive playing. (Which...can be rare for the man if you've heard enough recordings.)\n\nDisc two has some burning moments but unfortunately features many songs that do not show the band at an artistic peak. The classic tracks such as \u201cBlack Metal\u201d (a WRECKING ball version), \u201cBloodlust\u201d, \u201cWarhead\u201d and \u201cThe Chanting of the Priests\u201d all blast out like firebombs let loose in Times Square...but the remaining tracks such as \u201cSatanachist\u201d, \u201cFly Trap\u201d and \u201cLove Amongst the Dead\u201d all seem to fade in comparison to the joys of disc one.\n",
        "\nThis goofy meatball of a record is not terrible, yet it's utterly pointless at the same time. (Though I will give it two thumbs up for having some of the best artwork on any metal record at any time.) Venom are running on \"arena metal\" autopilot at this juncture and the best they can shove out it an fist-pumping, somewhat lethargic tribute to themselves (thank God Cronos can still sing like he always did...possibly even better) that from afar is entertaining but totally irrelelvant in todays world of metal. Sadly, this record might just be the Venom swan song as little has been heard about the band since Cronos suffered a severe neck injury. \n\nMuch of the album suffers on a songwriting level as well as finding the band being \"out of touch with the times\". Some of the songs are quite good but some are very, very poor. The one-two slam of \"Resurrection\" and the banging \"Pandemonium\" are quite good but songs like \"Pain\" and \"Control Freak\" are simply laughable. (Not in the \"humor haha\" way either.) Venom are artistically dry, desperate for something more substantial than a bad shout-along chorus that is fun in the moment yet adding depth to their already legendary career.\n\nVenom are striking out with this one, though I do play it quite often. It's the musical version of \"junk food\" that leaves me interested for only the time that I am listening to it.\n",
        "\nNo, this compilation doesn't contain the songs \"Welcome to Hell\" or \"In League With Satan\". No, it doesn't contain any material from after At War With Satan (and \"Rip Ride\" is the sole inclusion from that album). If you're already a certified Venom fan, and you have most of their releases, you need not add this one to your list. However, if you're unfamiliar with the band, but have wanted to give them a try, this is the place to start. \n\nConsisting almost entirely of material from their first two albums (plust the singles, \"Manitou\" and \"Bloodlust\", as well as the aforementioned \"Rip Ride\"), The Book of Armageddon is an excellent testament to Venom's classic years. Raw, amatuerish, nihlistic, and damn proud of it, Venom were everything Rock N' Roll was meant to be. Every song pulsates with the kind of energy and freshness that more professional bands can only dream of. Their juvenile enthusiasm could also work against them; they rarely capture the emotional eloquence of \"Master of Puppets\" or the fierce onslaught of \"Angel of Death\", but maybe it's just that; Venom were the only band that could make the apocalypse sound fun. That, and they could also come up with some pretty damn good songs. \n\nOpener \"Witching Hour\" sums the album up best. Ultrafast (to the point where drummer Abbadon can barely keep up with the rest of the band), filled with Satanic lyrics that are blatantly insincere, and even including a mock 50's prechorus (\"Allllllllllll hell breaks loooooooooose - Hell's breaking loose!\"), the song couldn't have been thrown together better. Mantas' guitar solo sounds as if he'd just mastered the art of finger-tapping, yet it's more memorable than most of Yngwie's material. This trend continues. \"Manitou\" seems to have been written right after someone in the band discovered how to record a drum sound backwards. Slap on a catchy, droning, chorus, and... whammo - instant song! \n\nOne can only imagine the writing session that produced \"Rip Ride\": \n\"Hey, we do a lot of fast songs, right? So why don't we do a really fast song?\" \n\"You mean, like, a REALLY fast song?\" \n\"Yeah, like a really, really fast song.\" \n\"Okay, how 'bout we make it even faster?\" \n\"Yeah!\" \n\nElsewhere, there's the crushing grooves of \"Countess Bathory\", the teriffically twisted \"Teachers Pet\" (two years before Van Halen fantasized about their teacher, Venom went ahead and fucked her), and the Kiss-on-speed riffery of \"Live Like an Angel (Die Like a Devil)\". The stern, dramatic chorus of \"1,000 Days of Sodom\" sees them at their most emotional, capturing the greatness of early Metallica and Slayer, while it's funky bass solo reminds us that crazy experimentation can actually work in Metal (after all, that is pretty much the basis of Venom's existence). The chorus in \"Black Metal\" (\"Lay down your soul to the god's Rock and Roll!\") may sound a little corny, perhaps even by Venom's standards, but it destroys most of the overblown tripe that calls itself Black Metal these days. \n\nWhile not perfect, this album is never boring. Over the course of their first three albums, Venom rarely came off as anything more than a garage band, but they played this role for everything it was worth (it's no wonder that this formula only lasted for such a short time). The Book of Armageddon isn't the be-all-end-all, but it sure as hell is entertaining. If you want to know why Venom are so highly regarded, look no further than here.\n",
        "\nYes! One just can't have enough fucking Venom! After spitting out their previous four abominations, they went and did the obligatory live album, and came out of the test brilliantly! \n\nThis slab of live blasphemy offers not one, but TWO shows: Hammersmith 1985 and New York 1986. I can't say which one is better since they both kick ass! The Hammersmith show is more dense in classics, though, incredible performances of \"7 Gates of Hell\" (one of the greatest Venom songs, hands down), \"Leave me in Hell\", \"Schizo\" and \"Witching Hour\". New York has the obligatory \"Black Metal\", \"Welcome to Hell\", \"Bloodlust\", \"Warhead\" and \"The Chanting of the Priests\". I know, not exactly a Venom classic, and is so incredibly cheesy (in 80s metal comparative terms) that it works in a bizarre way. Why is that? Oh I know, 'cause classic 80s heavy metal owns pretty much every single thing in the universe (give or take a few million light years). \n\nEvery song is played a lot faster than the originals, and the overall sound is great by thrash-heads standards. This means, no cristal clear bullshit production, just pure distortion, bulldozer rattling, warheads falling from the skyes, aaaarrrgghhhh....The live presence of the guys is noteworthy, this band really knew how to steal the show and prove that it's not a necessity to be kvlt enough to play no more than two shows in your entire carreer to blast some black metal into an audience. This record takes the best of the feel of classic live albums like Unleashed in the East and No Sleep 'till Hammersmith and give it a truly raw and evil twist.\n\nNeedless to say that if you like Venom you need this. Is also needless to say what I think of you if you're not a Venom fan.\n",
        "\nArrrggh! The title of the final track of this album, and an apt description for the feeling of unmitigated and juvenile joy it sometimes brings about in me. THis is no \"Black Metal\"...the songs just don't seem to quite have that energy and the production is worse, in my estimation..but damn, it's Venom....and I haven't really been disappointed with anything I've heard from Chronos, with or without his original bandmates. The crazy thing about this album is, of course, the title track...a twenty minute song. The idea of Venom recording a twenty minute epic is ludicrous sounding....absolutely absurd...and yet somehow they manage to pull it off. \"At War With Satan' sprawls, crashes and lurches through countless riffs with the brash, youthful energy of a drunken elephant...and damn if it isn't totally enjoyable. The whole thing feels like it could fall apart in an instant, reduced to a cacophony of disjointed sounds. SOmehow, despite Venom's obvious technical limitations, they manage to hold things together...proof that the music is so much more than the sum of its parts. The amount of excitement the band seems to have been feeling while recording this song is clear....there are so many buildup and release moments of tension...the music climaxing, Abadon's tumbling, chaotic drums slowing everything down...a breath or two...and suddenly everything crashes into being again with another riff, another caleidoscope of garish psychedelic lighting on the proverbial visual cortex. There's even a clean guitar break with a female doing some soft guest vocals. It lasts for about six seconds, and there are no illusions that Venom are anything but the misogynistic, rancid drunkards from England they have always come across as..but it manages to effectively convey a moment of quiet, simple beauty in all this chaos. There are lots of theatrical moments, too, such as deep, ooh so frightening spoken vocals...a hint probably taken up by Cradle of Filth, among others...and guitar solos wanking all over the place. Chronos sounds like himself too, luckily...although oddly enough, it sounds like he's got a cold in this first song....\"serve the bastah!\". The rest of the album is good, but doesn't, for the most part, live up to the title track. These are short songs, without a lot of power in them, unfortunately..with the notable exceptions of \"Ripride\", definitely one of Venom's fastest and most aggressive tracks, and my personal favourite, \"Women, leather and hell\". Many of the other tracks seem to suffer from the loose sounding recording though, and there seem to be what sound like glitches in the recording popping up here and there, although that could just be my copy or my interpretation of an intentional effect. \"ARgh!\" is noteworthy too, as it's not really a song, but some kind of alcohol induced frenzied exercise of the band playing chaotic nonsense, everyone shouting incoherently, and other assorted noises...they even stop t hings for a moment so someone can bang some slovenly chords on a piano. Venom have a sense of humour that's probably unparalelled in extreme metal, and it's part of the reason I enjoy them so much. They are so nasty, so over the top, and so damn fun to listen to.\n",
        "\nA complete and undeniable classic. This album is so full of spirit, so ripe with explosive energy it's almost indescribable. I'm not going to get into any sort of debate as to whether this is really \"black metal\" or not. It certainly sounds more like Motorhead, NWOBHM or proto-thrash and such than anything related to modern black metal...but its influence can still be felt in the furthest removed forms of black metal. Certainly there would have been no Bathory without Venom, and no Hellhammer either most likely, and bands like Sigh (and countless others) obviously owe Venom a huge debt. Anyway, that whole debate is old..what about the music? Well...every track here is a definite masterpiece of abrasive, uncontrollable madness, like a formula one racecar plunging through a crowded city, plowing through people, buildings and all slower vehicles that dare get in its path, with an alcoholic maniac at the wheel, grinnning and laughing with glee all the while. On the way of course, our driver will have to stop to pick up some big breasted girls, some of whom he will fornicate with total abandon, some of whom he will take out into the cemetery and slaughter in the name of Satan, still laughing and guzzling all the way. This is the kind of album one can play over and over and never grow bored with, never stop headbanging to with gusto or maniacally air guitaring along with. The worst song on here is the well known title track, which starts off the album and is still by no means an unworthy song. There are definite highlights to be found here, but those are really up to individual interpretation, since it is difficult not to be sucked in by the whole thing. For me, the ballad like \"Buried Alive\", with its particularly morbid sounding vocals and one of Mantas's best solos ever, leading straight into the fast and evil attack that is \"Raise the dead\", are two such highlight moments...along with the awesome 'Heaven's On Fire\", with a riff just about any thrash band that could dare call itself more advanced would have been envious to have written...\"Don't Burn the Witch\", possibly the most \"modern\" sounding song here, with a riff that was so blatantly stolen by Quorthon for Bathory's \"Born For Burning\"....damn, if I go on much longer I'll be listing the whole album. \"Acid queen\", which can be found on many of the rereleased versions of this album, is great fun, and \"Teacher's pet\" is a hillariously raunchy song about some highschool kid's wet dream, complete with slow bluesy section and catcalls and wolf whistles from the band and most likely everyone else in the studio as well. The production here is pretty loose and not of the highest professional quality, I suppose, but it sounds amazing...much better than the sometimes laughable (though still great) \"Welcome To Hell\"...and there are no technical glitches as seems to be the ocasional case with \"At War With Satan\". Cronos's vocals are totally understandable too, which is cool, since it makes it easy to sing along to these songs. I definitely think he has one of the coolest and most distinctive raspy vocal styles in metal. Venom receive a lot of crap from people who bitch about their lack of musicianship. This is something I don't entirely understand, since it's clear that a lot of newer bands play a hell of a lot worse than Venom did. Sure, they may not be stellar musicians, but Mantas's riffs and solos still manage to be completely unforgettable, and though Abadon's drumming is sloppy, he still somehow manages to hold everything together. Some people simply need to shut up and give credit where it's due...Venom know how to rock, and nothing more is really required. Although the music itself is superbly energetic and thus can be taken seriously and honestly loved, there is an obvious tongue in cheek and humorous nature to Venom's approach, something in many ways integral to a lot of rock n roll, which metal generally has abandoned in favour of melodramatic antics, in lyrics, presentation and music itself even. Venom are different in the sense that one can tell they don't really take all this satan shit too seriously; they're just out to have a good time, drink loads of beer and fuck loads of women, while creating some killer hard rock (I use the term in the general sense, since this is definitely metal) music in the process. a friend of mine once described Cronos as the perfect \"british redneck\", and here especially, as well, no doubt, as in his solo works which I haven't yet had the pleasure of hearing, this is really evident. One has to read the lyrics to \"teacher's pet\", or \"Acid Queen\" with a chuckle and go along for the ride, perhaps gaining as much enjoyment out of listening to this as the band clearly has in performing it. This is a landmark album, without a doubt. Even if it is rather remote from today's \"black metal scene\", one need only listen to the first two Bathory albums to see just how large of an impact it has made. Anyway, forget the influence on the black metal subgenre. None of that matters. What is relevant is that this album is so killer, it will never be far from your stereo, the songs never far from your head and the lyrics always waiting to be shouted out, with careless and unfetterred glee. Hail Satan!\n",
        "\nClocking at 20 minutes. The longest and greatest Venom song ever. Of course, I'm talking about the title track. \"At War with Satan\" contains everything you could have imagined from these savages: from the rock-and-roll-ish to the almost thrash-like riffing, Cronos spitting the epic history of the battle of Satan's army (quite a good reading) while beating the living shit out of his bass which sounds more like heavy machinery than an actual musical instrument, Mantas smoking soloing, Abbadon's skin beating sounding like someone dropping rocks on the drums. THAT, and much more: a chick singing (!!!!), a clean guitar interlude, glorious narrative passages in that good old british accent that gives shivers to my spine, and many, many more things. Listen to it and prepare to be owned.\n\nThe rest...\"Rip Ride\" is quite a good fast song following the tradition of \"Angel Dust\", \"Genocide\" contains quite good melody in vocals and you must go with the flow on this one instead of take a beating. These two and \"Women Leather and Hell\" are the most remarkable, not that the rest isn't bad (except for the awfully misplaced last track), but neither of those can stand to the monster that is the title track. Even if you get this album solely because of this song, you wouldn't be dissapointed.\n\nAnd the last track...just some random screaming and noise made with the instruments. It is fun to listen to the first time, but it gets old umbelievably fast.\n",
        "\nYes, there's life for Venom outside the trilogy that made them so famous. That reminds me, i must get some of their new shit *check*. Just because this album doesn't have all of the demented savagery of \"Welcome to Hell\", it doesn't mean the band turned into total pussies. This one has it's fair share of holocaust and death to please the masses!\n\nThe album begins with the speed metal \"Powerdrive\". I like headbanging all the way through this, hell, that's why this song was made for. It's rooted right in the tradition of \"Sons of Satan\", although less wild, more \"controlled\", but it kills anyway. Keep the headbanging, and your life will be spared. \"Flytrap\" is another great speed metal song, a bit more calmed than the previous (relatively speaking, that is. This song would still make most rock metal acts from the 80s shit in their pants). The solo is kind of funny, too, just listen to it. \"Satanachist\" isn't as remarkable, but it's fast, it kills and, obviously, it works. Same with \"Burn this Place (To the Ground)\", although this one is faster. It still slaughters you, but it lacks the more competent songwriting of the first two, although is not a complete waste of time. \n\nThings begin to take off again with that infectious riff at the beginning of \"Harmony Dies\". Another cool song, with a nice, catchy work in the verses and a smoking solo *plays some air guitar*. The title track is a midpaced song that relies more on Cronos' singing than the actual riffs. The verses slowly build the intensity that reaches it's peak right before the chorus. \"I'm Possessed by the *whatever*\" *headbangs some more*. The rest of the song is kind of generic to be honest. \"Moonshine\" is a song in the tradition of \"Angel Dust\" with some generic, but nice riffs and rhythms. Another GREAT solo by Mantas *plays some more air guitar* *the string breaks* *bummer*. It goes better near the end. \"Wing and a Prayer\" is a faster instrumental (well composed, i might say) that gives another dose of headbanging frenzy. \"Suffer not the Children\" is typical for the album, sounding similar to \"Flytrap\". What the fuck is up with the title of the song? Goddamn kids, always getting credit for doing nothing at all with their pitiful lives. The next two following have their moments, but i'll leave it here. I'm afraid to add that some of the worse parts out of these step into \"geigh\" territory, so...\n\nAre you a Venom fan? Really? Get this. What, you're not a Venom fan? Go fuck yourself, then.\n",
        "\nLet this be an example on how you should make the tribute to everyone's favorite semi-deity: raw, sloppy, crushing and RAW. This album is so fucking great i almost can't find the words to speak about it. This was obviously made by mentally unstable people, criminally insane, whatever you wanna call it. Just imagine three of the craziest guys in british metal going beyond what Priest, Motorhead and Sabbath were doing at the time. Now imagine if the result was beyond what even they would have expected. I don't know if that was exactly the case, all i can tell is that i wouldn't make this shit even if i tried!!\n\nJust check the opening song \"Sons of Satan\", fast and rocking, is actually so fast you can't sometimes figure out what is happening (maybe in a remastered CD you can get better results. Mine is a copied tape from a tape copied from an old vynil!). The title track is more mispaced, but still effective. \"Poison\", great chorus, same as \"Live like an Angel, Die like a Devil\" (kickass opening riff). \"Witching Hour\", \"1000 Days in Sodom\", \"In League with Satan\", all of them fucking classics. \"Red Light Fever\", fucking hilarious. Venom were always a fun kind of band, as you must know. \n\nI must have missed one or two songs from my previous description, so i'll go right with the highlights. OK, highlights: all of it. Well, all except the one minute instrumental \"Mayhem with Mercy\" that doesn't appeal to me as much. Is just what it is. As for the rest, man, prepare yourselves for quite a ride. This kicks you right in the face, stomach and genitals all at the same time and equally proportional intensity (quite a big foot if you think about it). Go ahead and buy it, damn it!\n",
        "\n\"Welcome To Hell\" was definitely a pivotal album for heavy metal. Few bands can claim to have begun a new metal genre, let alone several. The raw extremity of Venom's first effort at the time inspired the whole thrash metal movement that was to thrive throughout the rest of the 80s. Digitally remastered (along with Black Metal and At War With Satan) with extensive liner notes, pictures and an album's worth of bonus tracks (I'm not kidding) this is an essential pick up for both long time Venom fanatics and curious metalheads who want to know how it all started.\n\nVenom waste no time in getting straight into a crushingly heavy riff in opener \"Sons Of Satan\". Their style is an odd but original mix of the doomy sludge of Black Sabbath, the speed of Motorhead and the raw energy of punk rock. Add to this the snarling vocals of Cronos and the screaming guitar solos and it's hard to believe this was recorded in 1981. From the first minute the album is dominated by catchy but threatening and thrashy riffs, and it doesn't let up until the album's 40 minute duration is over. It's a relentless ride that shocks and awes in equal measure even today (over 20 years after). Perhaps the only break from the intensity is \"Mayhem With Mercy\", a short and effective acoustic piece. Scattered around in various places are sound effects enhancing an already foreboading and dark work of occultism (check the start of \"In League With Satan\" for one example). You can defnitely pick out from this album the elements that later thrash and death bands took their influences from.\n\nLooking at it as we have so far, it seems that this is an album that can't go wrong, however, there are some limitations. The musicmanship on display is not very impressive, but it is inventive and sincere. Not entirely incompetent but clumsy and not rehearsed well enough. The production is pretty awful, truth be told, sounding like you're listening to it with your head in a bucket of water. The guitar sound is noisy and not always very clear, and it sounds like Abaddon was drumming on boxes. But this does work in their favour, fitting the primitive, but fulfilling style well.\n\nAs a title like \"Welcome To Hell\" probably indicates, the lyrics on offer are littered with occult and Satanist images. These are done without either being cheesy or laughable, many subjects of which would become clich\u00e9d later on, proving their influence. The 11 bonus tracks on offer originate from demos, singles and other recording sessions. Most are alternative versions of songs on the album and there are many original tracks, boosting the value for money of this reissue. Venom's influence can be seen everywhere in the extreme metal world, best summed up by Lar$ Ulrich (don't mind the typographical pun) who stated \"Welcome To Hell was a classic! Black metal, speed metal, death metal - Venom started it all in 1981 with that one album\"\n",
        "\nThis album is so fucking raw and so unpolished that they managed to not wipe away ANY of the original fury that makes this band so damn enjoyable in the first place. Technical proficiency? I think not. Just decently memorable songwriting for the most part, and a raw performance that usually comes through only on a band's live albums. When this album gets going, it is fast-as-fuck over-the-top speed metal that would make a corpse headbang.\n\nHighlights... the title track of course, and also \"Raise the Dead\", \"Blood Lust\", and \"Leave Me in Hell\". All of those are speed-metal classics: Motorhead turned evil. And who can forget \"Die Hard\"!! What a way to close the album!\n\nComplaints - well, it's not all THAT consistent... some of the songs are kinda boring, like \"Buried Alive\", and some of them sound just a bit similar to each other. For the most part, it is the faster songs that are interesting, and it is a good thing that the album is dominated by them. \n\nAlso, some of the choruses are just a bit lame, i.e. \"To Hell! And Back!\" but the idea of putting the fast riffs under the verses and solidly keeping them there makes a whole fuckload of sense. For 1982, this is really fucking brutal stuff - no holding back, this album is 100% heavy 100% of the time (it is quite surprising how few bands manage to accomplish that!).\n",
        "\nThis is a very uninspired and forgettable album. Venom have gone from speed metal to very bland half-thrash. For the most part, this is not all that much removed from a Pantera album. \n\nHighlights are few and far between... the first few songs on the album sound just about the same, and it is not until \"Black Flame of Satan\" that we get a song that manages to do more than just plod along. This is speed metal in the vein of Jugulator, or perhaps newer Exciter. The only really good song on here - it doesn't sound much like old Venom simply because the production doesn't blow ass, but it does harken back to that style.\n\nThe same can't really be said for the rest of the stuff, which either never get going, or just plain stop when they do. Stupid tricks like half-thrash riffs (\"Leviathan\") or dropping the riffs entirely in the verses (\"Man Myth and Magic\") are here far too often... and even the rest is just plain boring. \"Vengeance\" resorts to some of their most banal lyrics yet, and \"Resurrection\", while the vocals are kinda cool, the song is just a turd, riding one decent riff until its legs fall off, and never really counterpointing it.\n\n\"Pain\" is halfway decent, with its moments of speed metal, but the verses are just so banal and content-free that the rest just can't redeem it. And that stupid little interlude just screams \"what the fuck\".\n\nIt's a really hit-or-miss album that has enough good ideas for maybe two or three songs. The rest is utterly formulaic, and totally devoid of the raw energy that made classic Venom so damn classic in the first place.\n",
        "\nDoes Venom really need any introduction at all...? Nah, I didn't think so. Well now what can you expect from Venom, seeing how this cd came out 19 years after the band released possibly THE second or third most influential cd for metal. What you can expect is an ass kicking! Wow, the guys are still cranking out awesome tunes. This cd is great from start to finish.\n\nThe band welcomes new drummer Annton into the group and he proves his worth behind the kit. He has some wicked drum licks, like in Pain and Control Freak. The music itself is pretty modern sounding, bordering on thrash. There is some awesome riffs and Chronos does great vocal work on this cd. He even gives somewhat cleaning singing a try on Leviathan and it works! Some material on this cd will stick with you for a few days. I often find myself suddenly singing songs from this cd, as most songs are pretty memorable like Loaded or Black Flame of Satan. Just like old Venom tunes, you'll probably find yourself givin'r with the chorus.If Venom is still around and kicking, as Venom news has been a little slow lately, I hope they put out more cds like this.\n"
