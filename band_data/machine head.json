        "\nMachine Head have made plenty of enemies over the years, and more than a few fans too, always leaving the various factions of the metal scene with something to talk about. Their tenth album, Of Kingdom and Crown looks set to give both groups something to bicker over once again. To give the briefest possible potted history of the Californian group, frontman Robb Flynn and his various partners have delivered zeitgeist-capturing full-lengths at least twice, been accused of guileless pandering a few times, and slumped into a hopeless mess on a similar number of occasions. Catharsis, the quartet\u2019s last release, has been widely criticized as the most misguided Machine Head opus in their 30 year history, so it comes as somewhat of a mixed blessing that Of Kingdom and Crown reverts strongly to the broadly accepted - even celebrated - style from the period bridging Through the Ashes of Empires and The Blackening. That makes me feel ancient, because those formative albums of my youth are now respectively 19 and 15 years old.\n\nIn any case, Machine Head take a positive step in returning to a sound recognizably their own - or Flynn\u2019s anyway, since none of the other current members played on those albums - and also slip in a few extra ingredients to differentiate proceedings just enough. Pinning down what these guys do has never been that easy, especially since nu metal and (let\u2019s call them) \u201cexperiments\u201d aplenty turned up on Catharsis, but for those of you living under a rock Machine Head play groove thrash similar to what Soulfly has done of late, while metalcore influences work both ways with debut Burn My Eyes having an impact on Lamb Of God and Devildriver but Killswitch Engage and Trivium leaving the imprint of breakdowns and airier singing after their emergence. Those floating melodic vocal parts impress upon me more than before during Of Kingdom and Crown, with development in that area and regression in the guitar hero antics that made The Blackening probably the first legit groove metal album where harmonized solos could be called the main draw. Yes, Wac\u0142aw \u201cVogg\u201d Kie\u0142tyka is now Machine Head\u2019s guitarist, though I can hardly spot a change from the old Flynn/Demmel team.\n\nPutting my finger on the most prominent feature that reminds me of old Machine Head, the riffs holler out the bandname from the instant they emerge. 'Slaughter the Martyr' not only begins on a very similar riffing pattern to 'Clenching the Fists of Dissent' (the only other 10 and a half minute Machine Head opener, from The Blackening) but even includes the classic pinch harmonic - the band\u2019s trademark - and deploys with a similar rhythmic build, despite the eventual drumming conforming more to metalcore beats than thrash. Elsewhere, quite specific signposting crops up to remind listeners of former songs, such as the main riff of 'Choke on the Ashes of Your Hate' (a messy throwback to 'Old'), the high-pitched tremolo on 'Become the Firestorm' ('This Is the End'), and particularly 'Bloodshot', which calls back to the climactic intro of 'Blood for Blood', nor can you tell me the similarity in titles came from mere coincidence. Notably, these throwbacks all occur in the first strikes of those named songs, so sceptics can feel free to latch onto that if you can\u2019t excuse the fact that the instrumentals are all at least decent.\n\nOn the other hand, the decisions to deviate from the template of classic Machine Head seem entirely tailored to swerve expectations. Want to titillate your fans for the first 3 minutes of a 60 minute album? Open the epic first track with weightless clean guitar pings and very attractive crooned singing, then drop harmonized vocals before charging into aforementioned pay-off riff. Oh, but autotune the vocals. Indeed, the thorn in the side for the well-conducted cleans on Of Kingdom and Crown must be the heavy effects used on them all. And that leads me on to the album\u2019s singles, of which 'Arrows in Words from the Sky' stands prominent (last summer\u2019s EP bore its name), as this cut opens with the lamest, most effect-ridden vocal of the whole experience. It works best as the album\u2019s closer due to a rising tide of passion, yet insists rather strongly that we all miss that time when \u201cemotive\u201d American metalcore was at the height of its popularity, something that 'My Hands Are Empty' had claimed a little less obviously as early as the end of 2020. Again, the syrupy clean vocals turn me off, this time as a gentle \u201cwoah-oh\u201d backing and weak chorus, while I\u2019m more convinced by Flynn\u2019s gritty roars and the choppy riffing. That the track selected for a video ('Choke on the Ashes\u2026') seems the most try-hard brutal number lends alarming credence to the argument that Of Kingdom and Crown was fabricated with PR specifically in mind.\n\nTo culminate my detailing of Machine Head\u2019s sins, I should reveal that I\u2019ve actually been lying about the title of this album. To my knowledge, this ought to be officially known as \u00d8f Kingd\u00f8m and Cr\u00f8wn, and every song herein titled with the ridiculous \u2018\u00f8\u2019 character wherever possible. As an American outfit, this seems significantly less forgiveable than the North European bands replacing \u2018of\u2019 with \u2018ov\u2019 in all their song names. (If it\u2019s just Nuclear Blast trolling us, then it would actually be kind of funny\u2026but I fear not.) I also haven\u2019t found space to mention that this release - whatever it should be called - purports to be a concept album, which is admittedly nothing criminal, although I would feel happier if the 3 brief spoken interludes hadn\u2019t been included to interfere with the album flow. Besides, if they were removed, I would never have known that these songs weren\u2019t just more Robb Flynn lyrics from the same source. From my ability to ignore the story, however, you can understand that investing time in the concept remains strictly optional.\n\nFinally, that paragraph where those of you following my critique begin to question my sanity, or at least my conscience. Of Kingdom and Crown, contrary to all argument, works very nicely as Machine Head\u2019s new album. The bulk of these songs satisfy in solid, primal ways, the riffing focus ensuring that any fan\u2019s head will practically hit the desk in front of them during 'Kill Thy Enemies' and 'Rotten' (besides those already mentioned), then the above average lead playing and moments of variation make the hour pass quickly enough. Needless to say, all the former pristine yet vanilla production jobs in the band\u2019s history set the standard here. The latest chapter in Machine Head\u2019s endless soap opera does not manage to elevate me to the levels of Burn My Eyes or The Blackening, nor does it break the mould with anything approaching the success of Unto the Locust, yet it delivers more than the expected quantity and quality, and for fans of Machine Fucking Head that in itself may be a kind of deliverance.\n\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Observer - http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/review/machine-of-kingdom-and-crown/\n",
        "\nIt's fun to shit all over a dreadful metal album every now and then, but only when there's something funny to shit on. Crapping over this would be as entertaining and meaningful as the album itself, which is far too little. The slightly more relevant question here isn't how shitty this is - it's why it's shitty. What could possibly inspire a child of the thrash metal scene to produce this sort of bland, transparent record of the lowest effort. Honestly, truthfully, those riffs that make up the album are all riffs you'd play as soon as you picked up the guitar as a sound test to check the amp level. These are never, ever riffs that you'd keep for a studio grade album. In no universe do you keep those, they're just a fun finger gymnastic to barely get you started.\n\nSo to get this cheap psychoanalysis going, it should be speculated Flynn might've felt such emptiness, such flatness and absolute boredom in his life that his artistic output couldn't avoid mirroring that inability to lift off the ground at all. And this has no lift, clearly. For all its gesticulating and unconvincing lures of pseudo anger and wasted energy, it does end up sounding like depression. It's one-dimensional, like Flynn wasn't all there and the two other dimensions were left at home somewhere in a sad old drawer. Some of the choruses are near-excruciating with how indefinite they sound. Like half a chorus idea was written, that was bland to start with, and then they just improvised on the spot and recorded that. How could they have been so rushed into making this ? \n\nOh, there. I've found what this is. It's a poor man's KoRn, a very poorly crafted (makeshift ?) knock-off of the real thing. On their first few records KoRn had odd and intricate panned guitar noises and arrangements, KoRn had real groove, and they had viciousness and originality; this takes all these things and makes a sleazy cartoon version of it. I said I wouldn't crap on this...but seriously, it lacks personality so greatly it's practically inhuman how mechanical and thoughtless it feels. Did Flynn and gang lose a bet, or were they this out of ideas; just out of phase entirely; and lost musically ? Such a disconnect asks serious questions about the artists' very lives, not just their artistic endeavor as an independent dynamic.\n\nThis is the rock bottom point in the movie when Flynn goes to Tibet and meets with the Grand Guru of Life or whatever, on the mountain top, and asks him for guidance. Is this album just playing the same groove/heavy riff over and over again ? Wait, am I going mad here. No seriously, I think it is. Good Lord, I'm sober and this distinctly is starting to feel like a bad trip. If someone gave me this random trivia that \"did you know Supercharger was written with just three notes ?\", I'd actually think about it for a few seconds. It sounds like the whole album lives in that upper neck area of frets 0 to 5 (and then their higher octaves), exclusively. Hold on, this thing is nearly an hour long - what the hell were they thinking ? Genuine question: who would listen to this past their teenage years ? Am I a teenager ? Wait no I'm not. I really shouldn't be spending too long on this. Bye bye.\n",
        "\nAn open mind would accept any change as some old adage would point out. Drop those fences, you're not protecting yourself, you're only setting yourself up for failure in a world with nothing but closed doors. All that. Alright so what's so bad about this. So it's a little nu-metal flavored. Bearable if it's got groove probably, right ? Track 1: Oh, hmm. Rob Flynn. He's rapping. Let's just shake this off, it might get better later. Onward to track 2: oh is that... Limp Bizkit ? Is that Fred Dur-... yikes, it sure isn't great so far. Let's keep going. Come on. 'The blood, the sweat, the tears' up next: good track (*wipes sweat off forehead*). That verse is actually heavy, rather than that cheap jumpy, aggro stuff. The song is equipped with a nice pre-chorus and, would you believe, an emotional interlude that's at least half believable.\n\nThen it's more of that stuff from the first couple of tracks. Juvenile jumpy energy, straight up rap, or at least nu-metal (of the commercial kind). As nu-metally as they were, Korn for example at least made an effort to make music that paid attention to detail, with intricate arrangements. This is just: tell a lame, dense, over-the-top joke at the bar for a first sympathy laugh and then tell eight more in a row, possibly worse as they go. There are traces of the classic MH sound: 'Exhale The Vile' has that on its entire intro section and developments, and that opening scream is actually mighty. It feels like the tone has returned to old MH just a bit. We're given a main riff that's at least inspired, with a contagious rhythm pattern and the return of those characteristic natural harmonics. The chorus works well for alt metal like this, as it doesn't sound like radio-ready cheese. Massive groove in the middle too. This is the \"good part\" of the album as it follows with the band's rendition of 'Message in a bottle' by the Police, showing off a bit more of that really nice chorus guitar sound they had on here, in what is altogether a decent cover: although, a cover in the middle of an album ?\n\nThe rest is really more of Flynn's screaming through a slightly distorted channel. Choruses with stereotypical wah effects, and just that immediately obvious and blatant form of aggro mainstream stuff which worst facet is it's not even convincing at what it does. The band definitely weren't preoccupied with producing distinct parts, which if they did the nu-metal or even rap stuff could've worked, if only over strongly crafted composition. But again, it's not all terrible: that almost post-rock middle section in 'Devil With The King's Card'. That's good stuff. It's unique sounding, and definitely with a certain amount of depth to it. But then, it's this recurrent shift back to square one, in yet another track (it seems like there's twenty of them) with a terribly bland angry riff and a chorus of Flynn shouting some more \"Yah yah yah, Kah bah bah... Wwwwaaaaaaaaaah !\". \n\nWhat's the explanation for this ? It's not even certain money was the main thing. It's possible Flynn was just influenced, in an unfortunate way, by the surrounding scene with that growing interest of moving heavy music towards the dance scene, making it join the mainstream with an emphasis on whatever sounded young, oozing with immaturity and that teenage mischievousness. Flynn was 32 years young in 1999, so this may've been a nostalgia of his twenties, his seeking a rejuvenation of sorts. It's safe to say on some level at least, this is a bit embarrassing isn't it. Anyways. \nAlright, one more time mother-fudges, sing along: \"Yah yah yah, Kah bah bah... Wwwwwaaaaaaaaaah\".\n",
        "\nAt the midway point between their iconic debut and the commercial-sounding period in their discography that would follow, this album stylistically sits between both worlds with traces remaining of what made them so exclusive, bathed in a far more sterile solution. Despite starting off strong with a song as heavy as its title (that would be 'Ten ton hammer'), with its dark taint and a tormented chorus easy to get behind, what follows is quite frankly a (very) poor man's 'Burn my eyes' without trying to sound haughty. \"The more things change, the more they stay the same\" is an oddly deep quote to pick for an album that prides itself on its lack of subtlety. The massive balls on 'Burn my eyes' are turned into a trite testosterone overdose here, with a strong penchant for groove for the sake of groove rather than heaviness absorbed into excellent song-writing. The tracks do have identity on this but there's a general feeling of obviousness throughout, like the contagious energy from the first is now just the excess let loose without the channeling, blunted by careless composition, akin to something like structural laziness and a worrisome lack of focus. The riffs are made too simplistic in the Machine head formula and have little lift behind them past the huge 5150 amp sound and in-your-face production.\n\n'Burn my eyes' had (arguably at least) some of the best riffs from that whole mid-90's period on it. It had 'Davidian' and a host of immediately recognizable metal themes. This explores the more tedious hardcore aspect of the MH sound, as loudness over-saturates the listener quickly unless they're a sucker for repetitive chug-chug-chug, and the parts far too often settle for massive, low-definition chunks thrusting at the audience. In comparison to their previous effort, it feels generally like the songs are almost \"unfinished\", like they're lacking an entire dimension to them and the band just focused on the rhythm section and forgot the riffs - something to that effect. Loads of the material here is just the same minimalist grooves on repeat, with certain songs focusing entirely on the buildup; only there just isn't enough at the starting point to build up from, and the developments are lackluster. And it's not just one song, it's the next, and the one after that. It's just too bare, even uneventful, for its own good. And when the album feels like mixing it up a little and introducing a bit of detail with some of its darker moments starting off with a dissonant soloed guitar eventually leading to the all-instrumental climax, even those sound uninspired and hardly convincing. So much here sounds just...aimless. Or at least, vain. In varying degrees.\n\nNot that this represents the entire album (which, by the way: 50 plus minutes for this style is just way too long), but taking the song 'Bay of Pigs' for example, that bam-bam-1-2-3-4, bam-bam-1-2-3-4 chorus is alright, but is it worthy of a spot on a studio album ? It sounds like a cool groove one would come up with on the spot at the jam space with the guys, and then forget about it the following week. There are just too many stereotype repetitions of pick slides and soloed growling bass moments and benign chug-kah-chuchug chug-kah-chuchug, bland wah effects and Flynn screaming in your ear on this for it not to get aggravating at some point. It all works towards this formulaic, predictable space of \"ugh, we're here now...\" and no spark seems like it'll be coming. A song will come up that'll feel a tad more interesting, say 'Violate' towards the 35min mark; with its dark-lonely-thoughts-while-wasted energy; but then it's another one of those sludgy refrains the album has already been berating its audience with for the past hour - or so it feels.\n\nThe album title reminds: 'The more things change...'. Yes, well, things would change from Machine Head indeed immediately after this disappointing effort, making this feel like it's on the right side of their timeline, ironically enough, before the less-than-ideal period to come. Really, it doesn't suffer from \"yo yo mothafucka\" nu-metal-itis, but rather, suffers from general ineptness. How many people would willingly want to listen to a gigantic, fifty three minute chug-fest ? Who would rather listen to this than 'Burn my eyes', which does everything this does but a hundred times better ? The late 90's/start of the new millennium were obviously a time of immaturity for Flynn and gang, and probably confusion too. Maybe the success of the first album got to their (machine) heads ?\n",
        "\nThe endeavor of metal was always to produce the heaviest form of music, and this is verified in the trajectory the genre took as a whole over the years. Metal guitars went from limited over-driven thickness at their inception, to gradually more precise high gain tones and tube amp bias aggressiveness, and with that, bigger riffs with heavier grooves. Drums went from a solid backup beat station, to in-your-face smashing presence. Vocals turned thicker, and lower-pitched like all other instruments. It's 1994 as the spoken word preface in 'Old' (Track 2) states, and along came the Peavey 5150: a recent gift from the metal gods to he who could wield its tectonic potential. \n\nAnd say what you want about how Rob Flynn contributed to the gangsta approach to cross-over mid 90's metal; and its subsequent after-effects notably in a style like nu-metal; but that year, the man answered the call for pushing metal in its inevitable evolution towards a new level of heaviness, undoubtedly. If you're unfamiliar or simply forgot, have a listen right now to the verse riff of 'Thousand lies', where one will hear in all its glory the bare, soloed guitar tone of this album. That riff may be too jumpy for one's liking, and fair enough, but I do recall it is second nature to virtually all metal guitarists as they try out a new amp, to chug the hell out of it first. And this album is certainly no mere chug-fest, but there's no shortage of seismic tremors like this one. 'Burn my eyes' has massive balls. It's hard to think of an album that holds its own musically while dropping its crotch on the table so unapologetically. It doesn't care about convention; and for what it is accomplishing here - with its aesthetics, message and the sheer music - it is untouchable, and real.\n\nTruth be told: in decades of dedicated metal adoration, I haven't still to this day heard anything heavier than the outro breakdown to 'Davidian'. A classic fan of older school metal acts like Pantera would point to something like the outro breakdown to 'Domination' as the gold standard for headbang-compelling heavy goodness, which packs a mean punch indeed, but with all due respect, 'Davidian' simply takes it up a notch in that department. They got the production so right on this: a taste of modern precision and clarity binded onto the warmest organic overall timbre. Besides this, there are some of the best riffs and grooves around on this thing. All of 'Davidian' is at this point legendary tier groove metal/post-thrash, and the main riff for 'Old' is as good for that dynamic style as one will find, an absolute exciter, followed by that imposing/hard-edged thrashy verse. But then the guys came up with some genuine themes (whole with a chord structure and instantly recognizable), not just spicy isolated riff singularities: 'The rage to overcome' is just a devilishly dark metal theme. It's excellently managed from its presentation to the various stages in its buildup. Which is another thing this album excels at: pace and section management; not just laying out their riffs and calling it a job done, like some bands do. Another massive groove with those signature natural harmonics for a tail ensues midway in the track.\n\nThis album may not be one's cup of tea on the whole, but that main riff a few seconds into 'Death Church' is just simply metal as hell. Think 'Burn my eyes' is all cross-over borderline hip-hop crap that has no proper metal in it: check out the main riff on 'Blood for blood' right after that deliciously creative intro of distortion noise in the track. Excellence. Now do 'Real eyes realize real lies'. Cheesy title, killer atmosphere and riff. And a major influence, by the way, for a band like Lamb of God for the esteemed instrumental track 'Ashes of the wake'. Could one say Machine Head on this album inspired the entire post-thrash/groove metal movement single-handedly ? Those claims are hardly ever verifiable, but to say this was a major contributor to the advent of such quality groove/post-thrash acts as Lamb of God or Gojira (both having cited this album) would certainly be in order.\n\nAn interesting aspect is the album won't just do the listeners' heads in with maximum metal tonnage as it looks to mix it up a bit. The guitars turn quieter, with only a hint of dirt, utilized for intros and the precursor to the buildups. Amidst the vociferous barks (which are indeed forceful), Flynn will move to his more personal/introverted mode, and the drums will show off a more subtle array of moves - and Kontos overall does put in an outstanding shift on the kit. These moments may feel like they're compromising the \"metalness\" at stake, but really they're giving the album more depth and variety in texture. In sense: giving it more volume, and spreading its wings as opposed to staying forever grounded applying the exact same formula over and over. \n\nThere's no doubt this album came as a breath of fresh air in a genre that has a tendency to be overly formatted and sometimes flat with its inspirations. It is done tastefully enough here as those softer sections are incorporated into cleverly planned, solidly crafted songs, although it is true the band started going to that too much, maybe way too much later in their discography. What they achieved here would never again be replicated. By them, or any other. This was the culmination of Rob Flynn (27 at the time) as a song-writer in what can be considered his most essential offering; what he was put on this Earth to create, musically speaking, that was most unique, shaped by his atypical individual ability, and unattainable by anyone else but him. The shadow cast by it over the rest of Machine Head's own existence, or the groove movement overall, has irrevocably remained monumental til this day.\n",
        "\nI like Machine Head. Their more modern songs manage to beautifully combine melody, thrash, groove, angry verses, catchy choruses and the occasional breakdown into wondeful songs. When Machine Head are on top form, they make some of the best songs I have ever heard. Catharsis however, was a really terrible album with cringeworthy lyrics that everybody, whether left wing or right wing, completely hated. After that album I stopped paying attention to the band and they flew under my rader for about 3 years.\n\nThis EP however, is a showcase of everything Machine Head can do right. For one, it is littered with amazing riffs. One moment you get a wonderful thrashy riff that sets the pace before the song shifts into crushing grooves that shove you right into the floor. The album knows when to make the shift, it never feels out of place and all of the riffs are awesome. They make excellent use of chugs and harmonics in a way that Machine Head have been great at in the past, much like the riff just before the breakdown in Become the Firestorm and basically every single riff on Rotten.\n\nThe drums are a massive highlight. Navene Koperweis of Entheos fame (as well as Animals as Leaders for their first 2 albums) is a monster behind the kit and knows just when to use his cymbals and bells. His blast beats add a wonderful dimension to the songs they're on and he never likes to stay with just simple drum grooves. His use of his kit reminds me of when Alex Bent joined Trivium for The Sin and the Sentence. Navene's exploration and use of the drums really makes the songs on this EP stand out. As a side note as well, the production on this album is great for the other instruments and the vocals, but they make the drums sounds utterly massive and it makes the awesome grooves hit even harder.\n\nRobb Flynn's \"barking in key\" style vocals (his own words) are usually an acquired taste to put it one way. Flynn likes to suck in air through his teeth a lot and sometimes his lyrics can regress to the Nu-metal style of \"fuck you, you suck, im so damaged\". But I didn't notice a single cringe worthy line on all 3 tracks of this EP and I was loving all but 1 of the chorused. Flynn is truely on top form and sounds perfectly gruff on the verses while still managing to provide beautiful vocals to each melodic section and each chorus (except 1 of them).\n\nEverything else is also done to a great degree as well. The use of melody is awesome, the occasional breakdowns are utterly crushing, the solos balance shredding speed and comprehendable melody amazingly and the album art is a small touch but is greatly drawn and describes the album pretty well. \n\nEven the albums use of samples is great. The end of Rotten has this small melody that sounds like the beginning of A Silver Mt Zion's 13 Angels Standing Guard (it's that song that made Tiktok think it was listening to angels) and the sample leads into the beginning of Arrows wonderfully. As well as that, Arrows contains a small sample of a manipulated distroted guitar that really works as a bridge between the verse and chorus.\n\nI do have some complaints however. The chorus on Firestorm feels deflated because the vocals from Jared MacEachern sound pretty bad (normally he's great but here he wasn't very good for some reason) and the tremolo doesn't mix with them. The tremolo riff at the beginning of Firestorm is pretty good but feels like it doesnt have as much impact as it should because of the lack of a background riff. And finally, the verse that starts after the end of the chorus of Rotten doesnt sound all that good and doesnt work with the end of that chorus. \n\nBut despite those small gripes, I think the best way to describe this EP is that it combines all of the best parts of Machine Head's best music. Firestorm is an explosive, thrashy opening to the EP with a groovy middle section to break up the speed that reminds me of Aesthetics of Hate, I am Hell (Sonata in C#) and Now We Die. Rotten is a celebreation of heavy crushing grooves and gruff voals that sounds like Machine Head at their heaviest. And finally, my favourite track, Arrows in Words From the Sky is an ultra melodic track that reminds me very much of Halo. It manages to be beautiful while not being sappy (to me at least) and still has a heavier middle section that then leads into a calm interlude before hitting back with the melodic chorus. The only thing it's really missing is that when it brings back the chorus, it should come back at elevated force instead of just normally so that it has even mor eimpact like what happens on Halo.\n\nI know that Machine Head have been writing a new album for a year now. If they can deliver material this good, or ever better, on their next album, they could make something amazing that could even top Unto The Locust as their best album.\n",
        "\nOver the years it has become a popular sport to tear up bands and their work in the air, bands whose influence used to be great are now portrayed as jokes. Why is that? Because the times and the bands change, most of them don't always want to do the same thing and so the fans are displeased. Machine Head may not have invented a new subgenre like other bands that Rob Flynn and his crew have been influenced by, but they have achieved an autonomy that not every band is able to achieve. \n\nFrom today's perspective, \"Burn My Eyes\" is a classic and although it is heavily influenced by Pantera, it is not a 1:1 copy. Machine Head did what almost every band does, emulating their heroes. What \"Burn My Eyes\" started is now known as the typical Machine Head sound because despite the Pantera worship they were able to bring their own identity to their debut album. Machine Head can of course be accused of adapting to trends because in the heyday of nu metal suddenly \"The Burning Red\" came along. I'm not exactly a fan of \"The Burning Red\" and its successor, \"Supercharger\" but they're not the worst examples of funny nu metal either. These two albums are also more than controversial among fans but are sometimes accepted, albeit with mockery. These two albums are fun, isn't that enough?\n\nBut after the next 4 absolutely brilliant albums \"Through the Ashes of Empires\", \"The Blackening\", \"Unto the Locust\" and \"Bloodstone & Diamonds\" (yes, I said brilliant) it came. The most hated Machine Head album, \"Catharsis\". This album splited the fanbase so much that many fans turned their backs on Machine Head. As if \"Catharsis\" was actually the worst album ever. From a lyrical point of view, it's pretty stupid, I don't know why Rob Flynn could rhyme such a snot and take it seriously. Musically, however, \"Catharsis\" is a good record. Not the best but good nonetheless.\n\nWith \"Arrows in Words from the Sky\" Machine Head deliver 3 songs that are reminiscent of \"Through the Ashes of Empires\", \"The Blackening\", \"Unto the Locust\" and \"Bloodstone & Diamonds\". And personally I'm more than happy with it. Machine Head haven't sounded so energetic since \"Bloodstone & Diamonds\". The blast beats in \"Become the Firestorm\" knocked me off my stool the first time I heard it, the chorus sits and stays in my ears and \"Become the Firestorm\" shoots everything away that Machine Head has recorded since 2014. The solo is well integrated and so dynamic, you can feel it in your flesh. It forms the centerpiece of one of Machinw Head's most aggressive songs ever. \"Rotten\", on the other hand, is a bit more groovy and has a breakdown that actually makes you think of metalcore, but skilfully bypasses this comparison. Here the solo section slays too.\n\nAnd the title track is one of the best songs Rob Flynn ever wrote! Absolutely everything is right here. The Machine Head melancholy can be felt again, Rob's vocal lines are wonderfully staged, the instrumentation bends to the atmosphere. Simply beautiful: \"Arrows in Words from the Sky\" is part of a series of Machine Head's heroic masterpieces like \"Clenching the Fist of Dissent\", \"Days Turn Blue to Gray\" and \"Who We Are\". And yes Rob Flynn is a weird owl, but he's still a gifted musician and a great singer. I do not deviate from this opinion. Basically \"My Hands Are Empty\" should have been on this EP instead of being released as a single, since both releases share the same concept in the cover artwork and are also musically very similar, I assume that they come from the same session.\n\nTo conclude, Machine Head is a band that has been with me for a long time. I love most of their albums and yes, \"Catharsis\" is a good album too. They never really disappointed me and yet I have to say that \"Arrows in Words from the Sky\" contains the strongest songs since 2014. I hope that the next album will continue on the path they have chosen and will contain more such breakers. The hatred that Machine Head always seems to haunt was and is unjustified. The hatred is more towards Rob, who sometimes doesn't seem to know where he's going, sometimes talks garbage but still seems to be a likeable guy. But no matter what he may be, he is one thing for sure: a good musician! \"Arrows in Words from the Sky\" is a collection of brilliant songs and no criticism on this earth can change that fact.\n",
        "\nThe Blackening is less an album and more of a time capsule of heavy metal trends in the mid to late 2000s. It\u2019s like if the 90s never ended, but is coming to terms with having to end. For Machine Head, it seems to be a top business decision \u2013 Destruction released the motherfucking Antichrist, but they\u2019ve been chasing that dragon for the past 20 years (never mind the 6 years spent at The Blackening\u2019s release), Trivium\u2019s shtick of \u201cMetallica riffs in a Shadows Fall guise\u201d wore off somewhat when they took the core out of their formula, and Evile were definitely more about having their nostalgia glands expressed than anything else at the time. Not to mention, Slipknot aside, nu metal was pretty much dead, metalcore was following suit, and deathcore didn\u2019t quite catch on like those two sounds did. Machine Head? They got the perfect bland of modern and retro! People hating on modern metal, wanting a trip back to the past? Well, hey, let\u2019s get these two guys who had played in bands during the time of Slayer and Metallica\u2019s reign to bridge that gap! Surely, this is the greatest metal album of all-time, right? Right?\n\nWro-- well, it depends on how you look at it. Check by check, it goes between thrashy and groove with kick to it. These make for some pretty sick live shows. It lays a lot of the main riffs on thick, largely because of the heavily layered production. Like, you know how Pantera laid it on thick with Far Beyond Driven, particularly during its most intense moments? Yeah, that. Although what Far Beyond Driven had going for it \u2013 for the most part, anyway \u2013 were driving grooves. Songs like \u201cStrength Beyond Strength\u201d and \u201cSlaughtered\u201d positively pummelled the shit out of you with hard and heavy riffing, all the while being catchier than the Duck Tales theme song. Machine Head\u2026 has that in spades, but somehow \u2013 as if they got cursed by a Gypsy \u2013 they find themselves constantly fumbling the ball.\n\nLike, you get \u201cClenching the Fists of Dissent\u201d with this marching theme and kicking groove, \u201cSlanderous\u201d with its smooth verse riff, \u201cNow I Lay Thee Down\u201d with its more melancholic mood, \u201cWolves\u201d with its first three minutes of kinetic melodicism. Not to mention \u201cAesthetics of Hate\u201d having a legitimately slick set of riffs. But the monkey\u2019s paw comes with the songs either dragging these things on, inserting some irrelevant noodling/non-groove halfway through, or just not doing a whole lot with them in general.\n\n\u201cHalo\u201d is especially guilty of all of the sins of The Blackening as it\u2019s got slow and easy to follow groove going on and the fast bit in the middle has some kick to it. But between the obnoxiously poor leads/vocal volume ratio (seriously why are the leads so fucking pronounced in the mix and so fucking poorly implemented like what the fuck this is fucking irritating to listen to), this absolute nothing breakdown, and the overall dragging quality of the song that does oh so little with its 9-minute length, it\u2019s amazing that this became a breakout hit. Maybe it speaks to what it does right? Well, most of that is better found elsewhere. Speaking of which, \u201cAesthetics of Hate\u201d stands as the highlight of the album based not just on having their best, most energetic composition, but for also having the least bullshit dragging it down out of the tracklist. It\u2019s just an assault of riffs and a fun melody with a minimal amount of noodling in the middle.\n\nBeyond that \u2013 like, are you really going to sit there and say \u201cWolves\u201d justifies its 9-minute length, really? It\u2019s a shame, because the first 3 minutes are fucking FIRE, son! It grabs you immediately with a strong groove, bounces with a mid-paced groove that\u2019s ridiculously fun, then the chorus goes and fffffffffffffffuck there is so much energy with the riffing and leads in the background \u2013 what could possibly go wrong? Oh, not much, just a bunch of go-nowhere grooving afterwards, that\u2019s all. From there, \u201cWolves\u201d goes from the best track to the greatest song to being almost as pertinent a point of criticism as \u201cHalo\u201d, just for different reasons.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t speak for the songs I didn\u2019t mention, which do get the fundamentals right but nothing else. There just isn\u2019t a lot going for them that gives them any long-term appeal. Even with the better songs, the only appeal there are the bits and pieces that stand tall. A decently smooth groove, a kicking segment, a shreddy Vio-lence-y solo \u2013 stuff that should be conducive towards a fully sick album and yet, executed in a way that doesn\u2019t reflect them very well. Never mind the filler. I know, I know \u2013 this is a lot of peoples\u2019 favorite albums. Hell, I was with a lot of you! But even back in 2007, that came with a giant fucking asterisk \u2013 namely, the good parts were really really fucking good and the rest were a necessary evil to bridge them together. In 2021 \u2013 shiiiiiit, since 2008 probably, it\u2019s more a matter of wanting Machine Head to hopefully finally capitalize on what they got right on this album\u2026\n\n...which came with them spending the next ten years chasing their own dragon. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 you know how like relatively few people could really care less about Bloodstone & Diamonds? It\u2019s not because of how bad that album was, at least not as much as it has to do with just how kinda\u2026. there The Blackening really was in the grand scheme of things. The catch of this was that when the good moments happened, they were hyyyyyyyyype as they came and the rest, well, they were what they were. It\u2019s just that there wasn\u2019t a lot to be gained out of overextended songs that had decent foundations ruined someway, somehow. Robb Flynn is a great businessman in his own strange way because he knows (or at least knew) what was going on in the metal-sphere, as it were. It\u2019s just that Machine Head lucked out when they succeeded, and felt the weight of their own hubris when they didn\u2019t. A mixture of hype moments and filler that would make Naruto blush\u2026 aye yai yai\u2026\n",
        "\nMan, I was gonna list a few things as to why Machine head are really bad, I couldn't really come up with a terribly witty method of delivery so here's a brief list:\n- Endless, deeply stylised/photoshopped band photos that most K-pop bands would find over the top\n- The fact that they awkwardly changed their sound when nu metal got big, awkwardly changed it again when thrash kinda came back, and then awkwardly changed it again when market forces dictated it once more\n- Rob being the worst vocalist of all time, his awkwardly shouted stuff as bad as his autotune drenched clean whining\n- Algorythm shenanigans on various social media such that I hear about these guys and Slipknot far, far more than I need or want to. Thanks, Loudwire?\n\nSo anyway, Arrows in Words from The Sky. It's an EP, so it's short, so we're off to a good start as far as MH go. The rest, well. That uniquely bad modern metal production- no dynamics, conservative-hearing-someone-say-happy-holidays levels of triggering, interchangeable with about 20 million other bands, kinda thing. That unholy trinity of bad vocals, bad bad bad bad bad lyrics that you can also easily understand\n\n\"Honor, valor, I have shone\nCourage, respect carved in stone\nKillers, sinners are my flock\nSlaughter, carnage, butcher's block\n\nIf there was ever a time in my life\nThat time is now\nTake this weakness that cuts like a knife\nAnd smash it down\"\n\nI've said this about other way-past-their-prime bands, just imagine being a 50 year old and writing this. Anyway, the vocals are awful, but I want to make it clear that the rest sucks as well. Yeah, MH are technically competent- the dudes can play guitar and drums better than me, sure, but whether it's the very boring breakdown parts, the spectularly half assed blasts in Firestorm, Rotten's painful Dimebag-ish but with no charisma sorta vibe, it really is some of the most generic stuff going round. \n\nIf the thoroughly flogged out musical ideas where backed by a competent singer, it might scrape a 50%, maybe, who knows. But boring ass music combined with really really bad vocals is a truly lethal combo. Anyway, remarkably shit.\n",
        "\nShort, crisp and good too...\n\nOk a nearly 6 minute song may not be short in the true sense of the word, but it is crisp. After \"Catharsis\", many Machine Head fans suffered a shock, the reviews were devastating and there were even fans who wanted to turn their backs on Machine Head completely. All nonsense, as if \"Catharsis\" was really that bad. Yes, lyrically it seems naive and artificial, but musically it actually looks good.\n\n\"My Hands Are Empty\" has more from \"The Blackening\", even if the really big solos and the epic are missing. The riffs are nothing extraordinary but good Machine Head Standard paired with great melodies and a pretty strong songwriting. The chorus goes really well and lingers there too. Rob Flynn is in the best shape and authentically screams his soul out. It's just a new song and not an album. \n\nIt may be a song about which there is not too much to say but which I have made good friends with. A new album that keeps the level of this song would be enough for me. Get your heads out of your ass and enjoy a great song. \n\nHappy New Year, Friends!\n",
        "\nBloodstone & Diamonds is not an album that abandons all the common sense, critical praise and good will that Machine Head had suddenly developed with The Blackening and Unto the Locust, but it's a solid step backwards in terms of quality, somewhat of a 'dumbing down' that shows the band for whatever reason missed what they were doing beforehand. You've still got a few outbreaks of the more agile, thrash-inspired riffing and some exciting lead sequences, but this one goes for grooves and accessibility a little more than the albums leading to it, and some of the aforementioned faster breaks aren't really interesting. I think if I were to condense it all down to about 3-4 tracks you'd have a worthwhile followup to Unto the Locust, but it's padded out with some songs that don't exactly leave any impression on me.\n\nThe catchier tracks like \"Now We Do\" and \"Killers & Kings\" are wisely staggered on the frontside of the album, the former a groover reminiscent of Through the Ashes of Empires era but with the add-on of some symphonic strings, and the latter a a thrashing 90s-style pounder with a couple frilly little riffs in there to keep it feeling busy. I also dug the melody at the beginning of \"Ghosts Will Haunt My Bones\", but that one kind lapses into the nu metal with rock chorus stuff that I was never a fan of in this band's hands, even if Robb's voice sounds half-decent on the more atmospheric, emo moments where he's festooned with little melodies. After that I find it hard to remember much of anything... \"Sail Into the Black\" is a pretty atmospheric track with some creepy little piano sounds and an epic length to it that eventually surges into giant rolling double bass grooves, but I feel like the harder hitting parts don't live up to the beginning; and \"Beneath the Silt\" is another track with some potential even though it's got a dirty chuggy nu groove beneath it, I kind of like the psychedelic filtering on the vocals, and again he's got some good singing parts on that and deserves a little credit.\n\nThe instrumentation is fine, with another of the band's stronger drum showings when they hit those grooves, and a lot of subtle percussive builds during a lot of the atmospheric parts of which there are probably more here than any other Machine Head record. Bass sounds good, production on the guitars is just the perfect contrast of heaviness and melody, and while Flynn is still doing a lot of the Phil Anselmo style tough guy grunts and growls, he's clearly improved all around. I also think that lyrically this might be the peak for the group, the lines seem fairly well thought out compared to some of the garbage on the disc to follow. The last third of the album is partly a waste of time, with the soft ballad \"Damage Inside\", the throwaway sample track \"Imaginal Cells\", and the other songs back there doing a mix of the Korn-like nu metal vocals with a few thrash parts to try and smooth them out, but all told Bloodstone & Diamonds isn't a complete dropping of the ball, it's still much better than anything the band had put out prior to 2007, and if you were a fan of the two previous albums then you might have breathed a collective sigh of relief. Maybe for the last time...\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nUnto the Locust takes the thrashing energy and ambition that the Machine Head crew resurrected from their earlier years as musicians onto The Blackening, and then ramps up it a notch by armoring it with a more modern sensibility and an obvious increase in overall heaviness. I wouldn't stay that there is as great a stylistic disparity here as between the two albums before it, or between Through the Ashes of Empires and Supercharger, but this is far from a repeat of their 2007 surprise. Tempos, dynamics, and riff patterns are explored more interestingly, and I'd say that the thrash riffs in particular, on tunes like \"I Am Hell (Sonata in C#)\" and \"Be Still and Know\", are more nuanced and memorable than those from the previous album, even if it set a sort of standard to follow.\n\nMost improved for me on this album would be the vocals, which are more often given multi tracks or harmonies that strengthen them far more than just listening to Robb's delivery before. This is most felt in the chorus parts to tunes like \"Be Still and Know\" which are genuinely catchy, but you'll often hear this being done on various verses, so the distribution keeps an added intensity throughout the lion's share of the 49 minutes of material. Though you're still hearing a couple of grooves here or there, Unto the Locus really strives to maintain an air of respectability, and I could honestly say this one might impress fans into groups like Nevermore or Savage Messiah, even if they've had no interest in anything Machine Head had gotten up to before. It's not terribly technical, but it's hard hitting, half-intelligent and interesting. Other little nuances I heard hear were similar to bands like the French groove juggernaut Gojira, at least in some of the vocal delivery and picking patterns, or even Strapping Young Lad in how the vocals carry or the post-modern thrash atmosphere. You can also clearly hear a huge melodic Swedish death metal influence on tunes like \"This is the End\", and it's honestly not unwelcome because it's performed with the surging testosterone that fuels a lot of the better efforts from a Soilwork or Dark Tranquillity.\n\nThis was the best drumming Dave McClain (ex-Sacred Reich) had done on any of the Machine Head albums during his tenure, thundering and muscular and definitely making as much a statement as almost anything else on the record. The bass is solid and gives the heaviness much of its weight, and the lead guitar supply on this is simply inexhaustible, it's the most melodic album they've put out, but without losing the ballast it desperately needs to keep its groove-oriented audience in their seats, or out of their seats, kicking each other on the rump and flailing their inebriated limbs about. There are a few weirder progressive experiments like \"Darkness Within\", and you can get the impression that they were expanding themselves to see what would stick, not succeeding 100% of the time, but as an album emerging upon the popular metal landscape of 2011 I think this is probably the one most suited to its times, with the most weaponry to help the band compete with their often far younger peers in the groove, thrash and metalcore niches.\n\nThe lyrics are still a sore point, especially on tracks like \"Who We Are\" or \"This is the End\" which have all the artistry and cliche parades of angry teens, but let's face it, the overwhelming of majority is like this and those who accepted and enjoyed Machine Head's earlier material are not going to care one way or the other. Hardly embarrassing, just showing little to no thought as the lyricist just pulls the most obvious and basic images from the mind to the page. Otherwise, this is the best album in the Machine Head catalog, or the most 'worthy', still hovering below greatness, but a galaxy beyond some of the turds they've committed to tape before it. Not that this is in any way some mandatory band to experience, but if we reduced their career down to The Blackening, Unto the Locust and Machine F**king Head Live, it wouldn't belong in a dumpster. Of course, that's not the whole story, that's not reality, but 2007-2012 was clearly their peak and I can't formulate too much negative to say about it.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFor all the ire I've cast upon Machine Head's recording history, there's no question that the band has been a successful venture, with plenty of profitable touring, media attention, and record sales, even well before Robb Flynn started letting a lot of sparks fly across his social media and interviews. Despite all the returns on investment, I'd like to pretend that, in the four years after Through the Ashes of Empires, when the band was throwing this album together, they came to realization that 'this was how it should always have been'. If The Blackening were the lead-in for the band's career, then it all might have made a lot more sense. I'm not saying this is a 'great' record, but it's certainly a decent one, brilliant by comparison to the long stretch of earsores the band had previously manifest. It's the first studio album that actually deserves even the hype wave they ever surfed in on.\n\nIt's evident immediately in \"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\" that a part of this turnaround is that Robb finally remembered he was a thrasher. In fact, he and Phil Demmel, who also plays here, were part of one of the greatest West Coast thrash albums ever crafted in Vio-lence's Eternal Nightmare, and you can clearly hear that sort of riffing influence being integrated up against the band's nu/groove stylings. Funny enough, when you throw in some neck-jerking, mid-to-fast paced thrash riffs before that moshpit focus group breakdown, it all feels more effective due to the powerful contrasts. I'm not saying that the band's lowbrow riffing fare suddenly becomes more interesting on its own, because there are plenty of effortless, lamentable grooves here, but The Blackening assaults you right up front with the competent upbeat thrash, walls of wailing leads and lots of other guitar atmospheres that dress up even its most mundane moments. That bridge riff feels a lot like something Metallica would have used on Master of Puppets if they were more into gang shouts, and there's just no questioning that this presentation is a more musically ambitious and rich experience regardless of what flaws it carries forward from their garbage daze.\n\nDon't get me wrong here, this isn't a conscious fuck-you turnabout album which ignores the past; you're still getting a big chunk of Pantera worship, but I heard all manner of influences going into this one, from the Mike Muir-like 'emo' vocals of \"Beautiful Morning\", to the Tool-like structure of groove built into the verses of \"Now I Lay Thee Down\". You've still got a healthy heaping of those masculine radio rock chorus parts dominating the 'hard rock' channels since the mid-to-late 90s, but even there Flynn manages to string together some slightly more memorable lines and melodies than what you might expect from earlier records. His aggressive barks and roars are still heavily rooted in that whole Phil Anselmo/Skinlab/Pissing Razors style with a dash of generic metalcore angst, and they're for me one of the weaker parts of the album, outshined in almost every instance by the music itself, but I'd happily have this invade my earspace above nonsense like Supercharger or The Burning Red. The musicianship is by far the strongest they'd managed up to this point, and even though there are still a good percentage of pretty dull riffs that hold it back, you'll be surprised by some of the things that pop up.\n\nA couple of the tracks are pretty long by their standards, such as \"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\" or \"Wolves\", but I'd say they actually offer enough dynamic range within these to pad them out without lapsing into boring repetition, and perhaps more importantly, that good old thrashing spirit just keeps rearing its head enough, as if its an anchor that's holding the entire process together, and at this point in their game they couldn't have chosen a better focus point. A lot of the lyrics are pretty weak, but at least they don't come off overly goofy in conjunction with terrible music. I also liked the cover art aesthetics, the stark simplicity of the logo font with some classic religious imagery, preferable to all of the choices they made prior to Through the Ashes of Empires at least. Now The Blackening is not an album I'd pick out of a lineup of other material in my thrash (or limited groove metal) library, but if someone were cranking this in the car I wouldn't cover my ears or make a stinky face, I can give some credit where it is due and if this was the sort of passion for the craft they had been meting out since 1994 then I'd never have had cause for complaint. But can they keep it up?\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAdmittedly, there are a few things wrong with Supercharger. The songwriting is a bit sketchy at times, there aren't a lot of good riffs, we don't get any real solos, and the general performance is not ideal. It's also not heavy metal in the sense that the Metal Archives usually deals with, which explains why it's got so much flak. That said, it's not an execrable album in my opinion, nor is it my least favourite Machine Head album. That would be The Burning Red, which just seems so much more boring.\n\nFirst up: yes, nu metal. One reason this album doesn't work well is because it's stylistically attempting to be a nu metal album, just doesn't play to the genre's strengths. Guitars are tuned down, though not actually with many groovy riffs included, hence why Supercharger fails to strike gold in the \"dumb but fun\" category. Of course, there's almost a complete absence of solos, barring a micro-moment when 'Nausea' suddenly turns into a smoking section. In itself, the lack of solos isn't problematic, except Machine Head didn't have much else to use as a bridge, often attempting to build tension by repeating several notes and coming gradually out of a palm-mute, which is only useful once or twice. The vocals don't go down too many typical nu metal passages, except for a bit of rapping on a few tracks, which isn't nearly as forced and hamfisted as on The Burning Red. Mostly Robb Flynn switches between clean singing and some grittier semi-cleans, a few roars finding their way in when the intensity demands it. On the whole, Machine Head's fourth album tends more towards melodic material than harsh. God knows what the inspiration was for that ludicrous Tarzan moment on 'American High' though.\n\nSecondly: filler. We don't need this many songs on an album, especially if several of them are half-assed. I don't think I'm being harsh when I say that 'All in Your Head', 'Trephination', and 'Only the Names' could have done with a lot more work, better riffs, and more thoughtful lyrics - or they could just be thrown away altogether. Better a bad short album than a bad long one, right? 'Brown Acid' is fucking pointless as well, just a bunch of effects. Then we have 3 songs that aren't completely worthless, but are very low-grade material that are largely saved by having better lyrics or arrangements than the utter filler. I'm talking about 'Kick You When You're Down', 'Blank Generation', and 'American High'. Perhaps excising the songs mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph would have allowed the band to focus on the rest, salvaging any decent parts where they could, thus keeping the record largely on track.\n\nSo, we still have 7 songs that aren't balls, one of which is the intro. I still wouldn't say that any of these are great songs, but at least 'Bulldozer' and 'Supercharger' have a bit of crunchy pace and an okay riff or two, while 'Deafening Silence' is a surprisingly emotional slower song and much stronger than the title track of the previous release. The others are catchy or memorable in some way, especially 'Nausea', which seems to be the most well-developed song on here. Funnily enough, the reason why Supercharger tanked commercially comes from one of its safest bets, the streamlined 'Crashing Around You'. Sure, a video of urban carnage released on September 11th, 2001 could have been seen as offensive, though the song itself pleases in a good-natured, radio-friendly fashion. Unlucky, fellas. On the other hand, 'White Knuckle Blackout!' seems to be the only place where Machine Head really got to grips with nu metal in its essence, nailing the fat crunch of the guitar tone and laying the listener out with a bruising riff, plus getting the swagger of the chorus about right. Nu metal haters are going to hate this, but as a fan of Korn at the time, this was my instant favourite track and remains unskippable if I listen to the album.\n\nFor all the errors of judgement and execution, Machine Head are slightly rescued by a definite sense of fun that pervades Supercharger. This sense of fun doesn't exactly save the album from being awkward at times, but it stops it becoming the same bland beige that The Burning Red was. I mean - bad as this album sounds - I can still listen to it from start to finish and I probably will sing most of the lyrics and I might crack a smile or two. It's a stupid but bearable pal, basically. Criticize it musically and I won't argue, though Supercharger's flirtation with nu metal doesn't cause its downfall. Nu metal can be played well and sound energetic and anthemic: I would point out Korn's Take a Look in the Mirror as one of the better examples of the genre done with big balls and good songwriting. By comparison, this doesn't even play to the strengths of the genre by making the riffs big and fuzzy or tapping into some creepy vocal atmospherics. We get quite a different beast, which I believe was not nearly as trendy as many people say.\n",
        "\nWhile on some level Catharsis pretended to continue the increased level of musical proficiency and effectiveness Machine Head had begun to achieve with a few of the albums before it, on almost every other level it's a dumpster fire. When I first put this record in, I got the impression that it was some group of 14 year old metalcore kids who had picked up a copy of The Blackening and decided to pay it tribute along with with a little Killswitch Engage and maybe a handful of their favorite melodeath bands. The cover art looks exactly like something they would think of. The lyrics are beyond dumb, puerile translations of whatever Robb could look up on the news to become outraged that morning, and the music, while fast and often fairly adept in technicality alone, rings hollow on almost all fronts and is immediately forgettable. Whatever steps towards maturity and memorability the Californians had taken with their material starting the previous decade seemed to have now been sidelined for what is worth little more than soulless dreck. I bet Nuclear Blast was pretty thrilled when their lucrative new contract shat this one on their second outing.\n\nFor whatever reason, Machine Head seemed to bring back a little too much of the pure nu metal nonsense on cuts like the titular \"Catharsis\"? No matter how much you try to dress it up with that emotional soft pop side, once that groove comes out I feel like I'm stuck in a room full of dead air and ideas that were never that interesting the first time this band failed at them. The Pantera influence is also here in full force once again, and it's even funnier when they mix in their rap metal stuff as with the track \"California Bleeding\", one of the dumbest fucking songs I've heard while writing this blog, which no dirty rock & roll chorus is going to save. Other songs like \"Triple Beam\" are just dumb pandering grooves with bad hip hoppy verses and then tasteless early 00s alt rock chorus parts which the band must think is going to help them sell records. And maybe that's what happened, and I'm a grumpy old dude who is out of the loop, but personally I've never met anyone with a single positive thing to say about Catharsis. One other irritant here is that the band clearly had a hard on for the pop-infused hardcore & metalcore we were hearing out of both the US & UK 5-10 years ago, and you can tell by the light synth touches they throw into cuts like \"Catharsis\" and \"Kaleidoscope\". Say what you will about those bands, they pulled it off better than this one can.\n\nOf course, Robb had to spread his bleeding & beaten wings a little further here with \"Behind a Mask\" or \"Bastards\", which sound like some dopey acoustic track Aaron Lewis of Staind would right...but what the latter grows into, some weird anthemic fusion of The Dropkick Murphys and the Beatles, in which Robb tries to embrace minorities into the Machine Head fanbase while dropping sarcastic slurs at them, is the sappiest 'what the fuck' moment I've probably heard from any of these high profile nu metal bands. 'NO NO NO, NO NO FUCK NO, NO NO NO!' Do you want a Machine F**king Head High Five for your pedestrian protest anthem? 'GET YOUR MIDDLE FINGERS IN THE AIR AND SING, THEY CAN'T IGNORE US ANYMORE.' Reading these lyrics makes me feel like I'm in the midst of the rave scene in that Matrix sequel, only with worse music and surrounded by a bunch of edgy caricatures of cartoon PSAs with their capes flapping around in Robb's posterior wind. I'm all for people expressing social and political opinions that they feel strongly about, don't get me wrong, but try to do it with a little tact and nuance rather than overt cliches, condescension and reductionist stereotypes that do nobody any good.\n\nTo be fair there are other themes here being tackled with more personal, less obnoxious lyrics, but even then you're guaranteed to have some extremely weak musical idea fouling up whatever rare catchy bit they might have accidentally stumbled upon. There is approximately one song here, \"Heavy Lies the Crown\", which would actually be a half-decent mid-paced Swedish melodeath tune if it didn't have Robb's vocals or lyrics anywhere near it. The production is fine, the boys can still play, but ultimately, Catharsis is just one goofy, convoluted mess that feels half Midlife Crisis and half I Wrote These Songs in My Garage While Inhaling Fumes Because I'm Too High to Realize That I Left the Engine Running. It is, for my wallet, the worst Machine Head studio album, and I'd rather have all my body hair peeled off with masking tape while being forced to endure The Burning Red and Supercharger before ever listening to it again. \n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe Black Procession is a special issue 10\" vinyl with three live tracks taken from the two studio albums before it, recording during their 2010 tour of the same name. One could probably forgive the scantness of its content, since like many Record Day releases, Machine Head probably just wanted to have something packaged up fresh for fans; a lot of these things are directly meant for the collectors' market, and here they chose to just sift through a couple tapes of their recent performances and make it easy. I do like how the cover artwork is consistent with The Blackening's classic, minimalist style, and two of the tracks are taken from the first of their albums I'd actually consider decent, but that's really all that I can say positive about the EP.\n\nThough they don't sound terrible, the live mix here is a bit raw and suppressed, I felt like I was hearing it muffled through a tent at a festival...maybe if I was standing BEHIND the tent and they were on the other sides moshing it up with the crowd. You can still make out most of the instruments, but a lot of them just don't sound good. The vocals are not the best, but the backing vocals sound absolutely horrible. The leads are also kind of cheesy sounding and don't have the same impact that they do on the studio releases. Of the three tracks, \"Bite the Bullet\" probably comes off the most even, but since I don't like that song it's hardly some saving grace. And to be honest, the others don't do much justice to their own studio incarnations, so this is literally just some EP you'd want to file away in your record bin if you solely value its existence as a product that you can throw money at and add to another pile of similar products just to say you did.\n\nAnd then when you end up having to switch houses, apartments, dorm rooms this all becomes a big fat burden to load up onto grandma's truck with all your rare wax and DJ equipment. That may or may not be true for you and your situation, but what is definitely true is this is a complete waste of time, even if it's just 17 minutes and change.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nNearly a decade after Hellalive, and a not unreasonable amount of time to wait for a band thrust so far into the spotlight, Robb Flynn and his Machine Head released a slightly more elaborate follow-up live effort over 2 CDs. While its predecessor was no slouch at 80 minutes of content, this is over 100 and allows the band to draw upon a bigger pool of material, including some from the two albums before this, critical darlings in many circles, which had seriously increased the band's stock even among the disbelievers who justifiably loathed almost everything they had released up to that point. In fact this is quite up to date for the year it came out, devoting fully five of its 15 selections to tunes from 2011's Unto the Locust, an album that only had seven songs to begin with...\n\nAdd in the trifecta of \"Beautiful Morning\", \"Aesthetics of Hate\" and \"Halo\" from The Blackening and you have more than half of an experience which might skew well above the suck line. Burn My Eyes, the debut and least shitty of their first five albums, has a pair of tracks in \"Old\" and \"Davidian\" which grants a little more stabilization. I think Overkill kind of saturated the market on the ol' F-bomb emphasis with Fuck You and Then Some, but I'm sure some fraction of the Machine Head market does appreciate the stripped honesty of Machine F**king Head Live! Like if I'm getting off the late shift at the meatpacking plant the night before, sleeping in late and then starting my boozing early, you're damn right when Robb Flynn and friends enter the stage with pyrotechnical wizardry and lots of chugging I'm a holler \"MACHINE FUCKING HEAD!\" at the top of my lung capacity. To boot, this album was a slight surprise in how honestly it captured the group's sound, in a more raw form than I expected...without too much polish anywhere, lots of crowd noise that can occasionally even compete with the instruments, and a solid and substantial performance.\n\nIf you were at this performance and felt its energy and sincerity, you'd probably be aboard the train, at least for a couple hours, because they knock it out of the park. At least the UK fans at Manchester Central seemed to think so. The more metallic, musical material from the albums leading straight up to this glows in venue, with great dual harmonies, melodic chorus parts, thundering, precise drums, surging thrash breaks and a nice bass tone giving everything that much more punch. The leads as in \"Be Still and Know\" are a lot of fun here and the band sounds so much more on point than anything I've forced myself to endure through the 90s or earlier half of the 00s. Some form of professional and passionate equilibrium had been achieved through all its trials and tribulations and that reflects right back out through the product to the fans. As much as I don't like their bouncier nu metal material, just being in the presence of better tunes here almost makes it more tolerable, so I could listen through a jam like \"The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears\" or \"Old\" without needing to turn it off. Ultimately I think this is one of the top three Machine Head releases, and even though it's not one I'd ever personally break out with all of the gajillion options available to me by bands I tend to enjoy, I could fully understand why any would sing its praise. It crushes Hellalive both in the stronger selection of songs and the aural impact it leaves. They showed up, they gave a shit, they performed well, you got what you paid for, and for at least the couple years leading to this, they mattered.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBefore you've even heard a note of Through the Ashes of Empire you can already tell that some important change has been made. The title of the album is probably the best they've had, and the cover art leaves a more lasting impression with its haunting photographic effect. Perhaps some maturity has settled into this band, which had clearly not been struggling financially, but had been creatively bankrupt from the offset. After sitting through the actual content of the album, I'd concede that it's more thorough and ambitious than anything the band had released prior, with more of an ear for detail and at least some effort expended in assembling the songs together, tabulating a few more complex ideas than we'd heard from Robb Flynn across this project's backlog. All of this might seem like I'm setting up Machine Head for some glowing praise, but I assure you, I do not actually like Through the Ashes of Empire. It's not a good album, it's not even acceptable, but it's surely less shitty than the three leading up to it between 1997-2001.\n\nMachine Head drops some of the nu metal influence (I said 'some', not all) and comes to the decision that it really misses sounding like the band it was originally created to sound like. Yes, Through the Ashes of Empires is a Pantera wannabe about 60-70% of the time. The guitar tone, and the way a lot of the riffs are structured sound like Dimebag left them on the cutting room floor during the Vulgar Display of Power sessions, with a few spare lines of other members' cocaine. Flynn's harsher vocals sound a hell of a lot like Anselmo, excepting for a different regional accent that lends a difference in natural intonation. This isn't to say that the Californians had suddenly dumped their other influences; you still get some of those childish, angry Jonathan Davis buildups, you get a lot of those ditzy little organic hip hop/Korn influences like the weird guitars in \"Left Unfinished\". There are some lead sequences which sound a lot like they're trying to pull a Kirk Hammett from the Black Album era, and there are still a WHOLE lot of shitty bro chorus parts which are still trying to tap into that good old All-American contemporary hard rock zeitgeist that bands like Godsmack, Creed, Silverchair, Fighters and Nickelback appeal to, or nowadays Five Finger Death Punch...\n\nBut the Pantera similarities definitely distract away from the rest, and so Through the Ashes of Empires feels like another album that was trying to be a composite of heavy music trends, playing it safe with some of the big names' inspiration entwined into the songwriting, and it just feels like they were trying to win over whatever 'metal' audience was left that looks no further than Pantera or Black Label Society when they're browsing through the record store for some new HARD SHIT. It's all dressed up pretty enough...there are lots of pinch harmonics thrown around to give the riffs a sense they have more dimension to them, or a few faster thrash parts that go more for a Cowboys From Hell vibe than Far Beyond Driven. I'd even say a few of the cooler moments on the album were some of the more unexpected, clean guitars that sadly cede to more boring groove metal riffs, or when they step outside a little further with \"Elegy\", which starts off with a chugging doom/sludge vibe and some more hypnotic, wasted vocals before also ruining itself. There were compulsions behind some of the ideas that end up here which were probably strong to begin with, but Robb and the boys just can't seem to stick the landing on any of them.\n\nThe lyrics are about 80% awful cliches about emotional disenfranchisement and other social issues, that like most rock is supposed to sound genuinely angry and connect with the day-to-day struggles of the mainstream rock crowd that expects little more from it, plenty of F-bombs added to create just the right blast radius of pedestrian rage. A lot of the clean chorus parts here are pretty elaborate, he was trying to stretch himself as a singer, so why then are so few of them even remotely catchy? I mean, I'll give Machine Head that this one doesn't sound so phoned-in as The More Things Change... or Supercharger, but why can't I remember a single song 15 minutes later? It's a whole lot of effort dumped into just not enough. There are single riffs on Vulgar Display of Power that are better than this entire album. There are single Vio-lence songs better than Machine Head's entire discography for that matter, but how the mighty have fallen. In the interest of fairness, I think if this had just been the album they put out after Burn My Eyes, a lot of cringe material could have been avoided, and it would seem a sensible evolution there, but that still doesn't make it an album I'd ever listen to again if I weren't committing to giving their catalog another chance.\n\nCould it be a sign of better things to come?\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMachine Head's first proper live album came about a decade into their career, more time than some superstars wait for sure, so one can't really hold their feet to the fire for wanting to get a substantial studio backlog behind them before trying to sell such a product. It features a pretty even distribution of material from the four albums they'd put out before it, but that just means almost all of it is going to be really, really bad. You've got your 'crowd pleasers' like \"Old\", \"Ten Ton Hammer\", \"Take My Scars\", and...okay, I'm sorry, I just can't keep a straight face while trying to type this sentence. Let's cut to the chase: Hellalive is a terrible live album, but it's terrible for its content, not AS a live album, if that makes any sense.\n\nTechnically, it's passable in most respects. The guitars and vocals are pretty level, and sound at least as good if not better than their studio counterparts on many riffs. They go for a more straightforward sound on stage, you can still make out some of the guitar effects and subtleties of the studio work but it hits much more like a blunt object. Although Robb is trying to represent the range of trite emotions he brings to the studio, he's a little dumbed down on the delivery through this set and that's actually a good thing. Apart from whisking off into some of his clean-cut jock chorus parts, he doesn't sound as laughable as he's done on a few of the albums. Then again, some of the drifty, dreamy melodic mouth breathing he does on tunes like \"The Blood, The Sweat, the Tears\" sounds a little dopey and it's on a part like that where you can hear more effects on the voices. The bass isn't quite as fat on stage here, so the tunes do lose a little bit of depth, but the drums make up for it with a little more fiery energy beneath them.\n\nIt's not a pure proper live set because a few songs are yanked from a second date in Germany and added here or substituted for the UK gig, but a lot of live albums do this and its all for presenting to the fans who want a more seamless listening experience and maybe cutting out a few awkward flaws. As live records go, this one does a fair representation for the band, I cannot imagine a longtime fan of Machine Head in 2003 putting this in the car stereo and feeling let down. They pound on you with a lot of their cheesy groove metal songs and leave enough space to get their emo on too. But I simply cannot reconcile with this shitty music, because I do not enjoy what I'm listening to. Is this a better experience than Supercharger, The Burning Red, or the More Things Change...? Yes. Does it bring hte pain? The siccness? If you're 11, yes. Is it worth checking out when there are literally tens of thousands of better albums and better bands across every niche of the metal spectrum? Hard no.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThere's about a minute in the first proper song here, \"Bulldozer\", after the pointless and uninteresting \"Declaration\" intro has ended, where Machine Head breaks into what sounds like it could have been a half-tolerable thrash/hardcore riff section, and I'd love to say that it almost fooled me into thinking I might be in for a sea change from the two miserable full-length albums previous. But I gotta level with ya, I don't fucking trust this band at ALL to write anything of quality, so sure enough, within seconds, that same song unraveled into an unkempt amalgamation of Korn, Rage Against the Machine, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, and God Hates Us All era Slayer that reassures me that Supercharger is in no danger of breaking the stink-streak that preceded it.\n\nI could say a couple positive things about the production. The way the guitars and vocals here are produced is a little bit more edgy and cutting than the last album, and Robb is settling into his multiple vocal stylings a little more with each album. Unfortunately, all of those stylings are really lame even by 2001 standards. His rapping has gotten a little more dextrous and sounds like an actual attempt at rap, perhaps, but then it's all about laying on the angst and the nu-metal rage, once again a mid-90s Jonathan Davis with far less personality, or a try-hard Mike Patton, and both the lyrical content and delivery feel shallow. What's worse, he's obviously going for those cliche radio rock chorus tones and patterns that feel like he's trying to get Machine Head recruited for an 'Army of One' ad on TV, like they're trying to peddle themselves as my friendly local neighborhood Godsmack, a band that I must apologize for my neck of the woods (Southern NH/Northern MA) ever producing to plague your ears. But, be real, it's not as if Flynn's goofiness is any better.\n\nThe annoying vocals would be one thing, but the vast majority of riffs here are just pathetic, yet again bouncing back and forth between a couple chords that require no imagination whatsoever, just to cling to the grooves that the fat bass tone is laying out, which sound good studio-wise, but are really just as awful once you dissect them. I'd say Supercharger is slightly more technical and dynamic than The Burning Red; you will come across a couple riffs that have a genuine energy flowing to them, and they use a lot more guitar effects like wah-wah sounds all over the place to make this sound like much more of an organized mess, but any attempt at validity is ruined by the shitty commercial radio vocals and the obnoxious pandering that this album constantly gets into. This is 'metal' by numbers, the lowest common denominator kind, trying to cash in on the audiences of emotional rock and angry wallet-chain Lollapaloser mosh. Any time any rhythmic maneuver comes close to engaging my brain, it's almost instantly shat upon by a quick morph into the tedium that I've described above.\n\nIt's very clear that Machine Head were trying to follow the Korn trajectory around the turn of the century, with a lot more soft atmospheric parts contrasting against bleaker emotional outbursts, and Robb was also trying to get a decisive, pointed delivery to his chorus parts that David of Disturbed always had (\"Only the Names\" is a textbook example of all this). But that's the problem, we already had those bands, and this one did absolutely nothing as well as any of them. Not that I'm asking you to listen to them instead, I could probably count the number of metal albums I enjoy on a single hand with a missing thumb, but this is just more also-ran rubbish that time will swallow up, even the fans of Machine Head's earlier output don't seem so enamored with this one, and it doesn't take a degree to understand why.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBeing one of the most divisive bands in all of metal music lends itself to a unique standard of scrutiny only paralleled by other similarly divisive groups such as Metallica, Sepultura, and In Flames. Having the name Machine Head printed on the album cover means that we go into our personal listening experience of the album with an audible tainting of preconceived notions and strong opinions.\n\nWe generally accept it to be true that Burn My Eyes was an early groove metal masterpiece, bridging thrash with a more melodic and rhythmically complex style while adding elements of hardcore into the equation. We also generally accept that this style allowed a natural progression into the much maligned alternative metal of the time, and that Machine Head didn\u2019t release another truly classifiable metal album until 2003\u2019s Through the Ashes of Empires, which was followed by their second modern groove metal masterpiece: 2007\u2019s The Blackening.\n\nAnd that\u2014outside of some general acclaim for 2011\u2019s Unto the Locust\u2014is mostly where the conversation stops. Rob and Phil fell on creative differences, Rob at best descended into total madness and at worst became a self-aware meme, they released the Catharsis album which was a mouth vomit-inducing abomination far worse than any of their 90\u2019s nu metal forays, and we all moved on\u2014but wait! What about 2014\u2019s Bloodstone and Diamonds?\n\nIn objective terms, a good album is built as a full artistic work\u2014whether contextual or not\u2014to be a complete listening experience. The atmosphere and emotional arc of the full work must be considered. A great album fulfills this, but also makes each song independently great in-and-of itself. A fantastic album does both, but also challenges our preconceived notions of a particular idea or genre and creates something unique. And make no mistake, Bloodstone and Diamonds is a fantastic album. \n\nIt is heavier than The Blackening, more innovative and challenging than Burn My Eyes; it is truly Machine Head\u2019s unsung masterpiece. The discord between Rob and Phil is visceral, and while discord within a band often spells disaster for the final product (I\u2019m looking at you, St. Anger) that is far from the case here, rather adding desperation, depth, and an overall melancholic atmosphere of depravation overlaying the anthemic, high energy tracks.\n\nSpeaking of anthemic tracks, the album starts with \u201cNow We Die\u201d which uses strings to quickly build energy and explode into one of the most intense, anthemic songs Machine Head has ever composed. Complete with some giant riffs, some of Rob\u2019s best vocals, a chorus you can\u2019t help but sing along with, and a rather tasteful alla breve section/breakdown, this song really embodies everything good about Machine Head\u2019s past efforts while preparing you for the rest of the album.\n\nThe same energy can be felt all the way through \u201cNight of Long Knives.\u201d Then comes the second act of what I consider a three act album, starting with \u201cSail Into the Black.\u201d The intro separates the first act from the second, and it builds perfectly into the song. That\u2019s one thing this album does particularly well\u2014development. Sometimes chaos is welcome in metal, but often times emotion is best conveyed through subtlety and dynamic development. That is the case here.\n\nThe choice to include the sole ballad \u201cDamage Inside\u201d as the intro to the third act was brilliant. It is the last piece of rising action before the climax, \u201cGame Over,\u201d and gives it a sense of\u2014dare I say\u2014catharsis.\n\nAlthough I have neglected to dissect each song individually, I will make a couple broad notes: The musicianship on this album is perfect. There is no virtuoso guitar or highly technical, ultra-fast drum display, rather the songwriting is at the height of their refinement. Despite the long runtime, the songs never feel redundant. It never feels as though they focus on one theme for too long, and the themes build upon each other. Everything feels carefully calculated while at the same time discordant and intense, reflecting the discord within the band at the time.\n\nGive this one a chance. This album is a snapshot of beautiful artistic minds falling apart under the pressures of the legacy they built, and it is far too good to be ignored simply because it\u2019s a Machine Head album.\n\nHighlights:\n- Now We Die\n- Killers and Kings\n- Beneath the Silt\n- Game Over\n",
        "\nHere's another Machine Head EP which was released in a few territories, presumably to sate the demand for more recorded live material and rare 'demos' that I can't imagine anyone actually ever having asked for in their lives. That said, it's possible that even Robb and the band didn't give a shit about this, that it was some sort of record label promotion to keep them on the shelves at the shops, or in radio rotation, or whatever crappy music industry justification for wasting natural resources on dumb material products. But unlike the Take My Scars EP, which had a mediocre Nirvana cover on it, Year of the Dragon has no curiosities whatsoever, just churning out the most generic short-playing fan cash-in possible, with one demo track that might make it a collector's item for collectors of trash.\n\n\"The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears\" is the 'single' here, and it's presented in both its lame studio rendition, and one of the three live tracks that were recorded in Connecticut in 1999. It's following up after 3-4 other singles from The Burning Red album and one they put out for the Heavy Metal 2000 movie, which honestly baffles me, that any of the material could be considered good enough for air play... I mean, I don't know how anything by New Kids On the Block was ever considered quality, but they wrote better songs than these. At least I'm assuming...I wouldn't know much about that ::as he hides his copy of Hangin' Tough where you'll never find it:: The live songs are among the worst possible, between \"The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears\" and the awful \"Desire to Fire\" which is just possibly the most cringeworthy track Machine Head has ever produced in their mostly miserable catalog. \"From This Day\" isn't much better, it literally sounds like Limp Bizkit with a slightly heavier groove where he tries to do commercial rock vocals for the emerging Nickelback crowd.\n\nThe live tunes aren't recorded quite as well as those from the prior EP, but I suppose they are loud and brash and not as badly mixes as some I've encountered. So I'll give it a point for that, since I can't justify any of the musical value whatsoever except maybe the little 'HEY SLAYER GUYZ' riff that comes up late in \"From This Day\". \"New Resistance\" is the demo track closing out the EP, and I have no idea if this was something which was later reworked, but it's a horrible track that sounds like it belonged on The Burning Red or whatever Disturbed was writing at the time, there's a little bit of David Draiman in the vocals on that one but then again this wouldn't be the only case of that, the difference is that Disturbed has had the gall on a number of occasions to create memorably annoying songs, whereas Machine Head throughout the 90s just opted for the latter half of that equation.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI don't know what could possibly possess a band to spend years listening to and touring on an album like The More Things Change and then come to decision that they need to do this again...but that seems to be the motivation behind Machine Head's third full-length The Burning Red. If there's one difference here it's that the guys are clearly trying to sound a lot more like Korn than they already did, so you can bet the chug-laden hip hop influences are being cranked up to the extent that even Diabolus in Musica might be embarrassed to be found in its company. Full disclosure, as I've said before, I don't actually have a problem with the idea itself of mixing rap music with heavy riffing, it's just so rarely that I've heard it done well. If I do, it'll have my respect. Most of the nu metal bands who flirt with the idea take more of a rhythmic influence from that hybrid, with the bouncy beats, lyrical attitude, bass lines and guitar tricks that are attempting to emulate record scratching or other stylistic translations.\n\nKorn had already worn us out on that with their first 2-3 albums and Machine Head doesn't seem to accomplish much more than that several years later. So if you're truly enamored with Life is Peachy or Roots, get on with your bad self, but I think The Burning Red is notably worse than either of them. Robb does try his hand at rapping in the actual lyrical delivery, as in \"Desire to Fire\", and that comes off just as goofy as you'd imagine, you can just picture in your mind the hand movements he'd be making as he was bouncing along in the studio. I'm not saying he's the worst at it that I've ever heard, but once it surges into that lame chorus groove which sounds as if it's just been replicated off the last album, it just becomes too unintentionally hilarious. Add to that the monotonous crooning he adds to try and keep it all in the radio realm during the age of Creed and Alice in Chains, and we're in for one dumb fuck of an album. But it doesn't stop there, because that's basically the formula for almost the ENTIRE experience...dull churning nu metal guitars, rapped out pissed off lyrics, funkier or dissonant guitar lines and almost no ability whatsoever to turn in an interesting chorus. I mean come on, even Linkin fucking Park can deliver on the chorus, the best Robb Flynn and the bros here can accomplish is to sound like Limp Bizkit's steroid-addled cousin...or like a Jonathan Davis with far less personality and equally dumb lyrics.\n\nWhen this formula IS abandoned, it's to go even further into post-grunge woozy commercial 90s heavy rock territory with the 'emotional' parts like the verses in \"Silver\", which just sound like some drunk guys trying to get their Nirvana, Pearl Jam or Silverchair on. The lyrics once again come off like some distraught middle schooler who really wants you to know all the pain and castigation he's been through BUT HE IS STRONG AND DON'T FUCK WITH HIM...as long as it sounds personal, has no capacity to engage anyone with genuine intellectual depth, and rhymes, let's pay ball. They read like the lyrics Fred Durst would have come up with if he was doing an audition for Hatebreed or Madball before they jettisoned him from the rehearsal space moments later. You could literally punch Durst in over Flynn on \"Exhale the Vile\" and not know the difference. Give me any lyrics about Satan, Vikings, motorcycles or B-movie bloodbaths any day over this nonsense! The cover art sucks. The cover SONG sucks...\"Message in a Bottle\", how original...Excel did a great version of that a whole decade before this lazy and laughable execution. Maybe when you were in Vio-lence and actually had an ounce of talent, you should have paid more attention to the other thrash bands from your State?\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhy does Japan get all the nice things? Alright, the adjective 'nice' is debatable when discussing any of Machine Head's garbage, but the point stands that in decades of musical obsession I've run across loads of albums and singles that are fattened up for sale over there. Granted, they pay a higher price than we do on a lot of these goods, but even for something as lowly as this EP you're getting a lot more content. Really, Take My Scars is more of a single, featuring the titular track off The More Things Change and then a B-side cover, a couple of demo tracks (oh boy!); but the Japanese edition also includes nearly a half hour of live material. Now, I couldn't tell you for the life of me who this would be for...I know the band was and likely remains within the 'Nu Metal Top 10', but was there really a huge market for copious maxi-singles from bands like Korn, Sepultura or Machine Head?\n\nI've made my opinion on \"Take My Scars\" clear, it's a crappy nu-metal jam that sounds like it was strung together from the first few notes that popped up during a jam session, boring chords that do nothing other than emulate a primal hip hop groove with a little hardcore anger. That track is here in both a studio and live incarnation, and doesn't sound less awkward in either. I think the big draw on this would be the cover of Nirvana's \"Negative Creep\", which plays it pretty close to the original only adds a little fatter guitar tone. Robb's vocals are lower pitched than Cobain's, but he throws in a lot of wild screaming that almost make me wish he would just do that more often in his own band. In fact when listening to this it sounded a lot like another of the Seattle grunge bands, Tad, who I enjoy, covering Nirvana, and that alone makes it superior to all of Machine Head's original material here. The two demo tracks sound awful, nothing more than rougher cuts of what you hear on the radio and they don't improve anything except having that bridge to a more live atmosphere.\n\nThe five live cuts are from the band's limited two-album run at the time, and in terms of recording they do sound alright, provided you're already a fan of sub-mediocre music. It does sound a little messier, more pissed off and the hardcore parts on cuts like \"Blood for Blood\" sound even more hardcore and heavy in this context, so there is that to say for it. Of course if you aren't tracking down this very version of the EP then you won't hear those at all. Ultimate, Take My Scars isn't a product I'd recommend to anyone, but then again in general I wouldn't recommend any of their stuff, at least not for a big chunk of their career...let's explore further and hear if there are any diamonds in the rough.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhere Burn My Eyes sounded like it might have at least been extracted from some fossilized metal DNA of integrity somewhere along the path of its inception, The More Things Change... is little more than a giant, blubbery surrender to the most vapid and idiotic nu metal trends of the 90s, and revisiting this sophomore was admittedly both hilarious and embarrassing as I tried to scrape the dregs of the barrel and find anything, just ONE thing positive I could actually say about it. This is basically a mix of the first two Korn albums, Sepultura's Roots, and a little of the Biohazard and Sick of It All influence returning from the debut, manifest though the least shitty riffs found here, in tunes like \"Stuck a Nerve\", if only because bland hardcore riffs are far less obnoxious than the alternative Robb Flynn is providing us.\n\nI suppose the production is fine for what it is, Adam Duce's bass tone standing out here against the churning, boring chords and the occasional higher pitched, primitive droning guitars which are used to add at least some other sort of dimension to the material beyond just the grooves. And these are absolute rubbish nu metal riffs, which took next to no time whatsoever to conceive as they merely bounce back and forth between maybe 2-3 chords max. The band does reach out to create a few added dynamics as in \"Down to None\" with its dissonant guitars over a slower groove, but even there the results are little more than ennui as they can't ever seem to capitalize on a less throwaway riff with anything explosive or interesting. \"Take My Scars\" is a prime example of how bad this is with its mindless, lazy chords, and how Flynn tries to inject some mid-ranged doped up Alice in Chains style vocal to create a contrast or chorus to the roiling nothing below. The Rage Against the Machine guitar 'scratches' and angry hip hop vocals are also hilariously lame. The lead guitar, as basic as it is, almost seems out of place for trying to be too ambitious to what this album is all about, the cheapest cashing in on the LCD of metal music.\n\nNow I'm not opposed to really basic riffing structures, grooves or breakdowns if they're written well enough, hell I'm a pretty big fan of Helmet records like Meantime and Betty, which are likely also influences that rubbed off on some this mid-90s Machine Head era. But these guys just lack any trace of personality, it's as if you stripped down the already-basic ideas of nu metal, took away any of the goofy costumes or vocal gimmicks of the more visible bands in that scene, and came up with a generic blueprint on which to teach grade schoolers how to jump da fuc up with their wallet chains flailing around. The cover font, lazy, the cover artwork, pretty typical stuff that looks like half the proto metalcore records I used to have in the early 90s, and the lyrics are about of trite garbage like \"So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, we gotta wake up!\" Are you also down with the sickness? As a general rule, the more atmospheric the album gets, where it doesn't rely 100% on the dumb nu metal bounce parts, the material becomes ever more tolerable, as in \"Blood of the Zodiac\", which is tucked away at the end of the track list with its eerie intro, primal pensiveness and bluesy, sad solos. It's hard to believe this ISN'T the worst album in the band's catalog. Can it get much worse? Hold Robb's beer.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMachine Head is a bad band which becomes even more tragic for me when I look at what some of its members had accomplished years before its creation. That's not to say that Burn My Eyes is in any way the Californians' career nadir, far from it, but when I compare even this earlier effort to the first two Vio-lence albums that Rob Flynn played on it becomes instantly disappointing how much the guy absolutely sold the fuck out to whatever was trendy during the 90s. To be part of such kinetic, vicious, nearly flawless thrash metal like Eternal Nightmare, fully capable of causing the mullets to frenzy about and moshing to naturally erupt without the need for cheap breakdowns, and then later start up a band for which banal tribal tattoo mosh culture was the entire impetus to exist just comes across as depressing. Perhaps he was burned out with the diminishing success of his alma mater, who themselves were decreasing in quality as the changes in popular culture demoralized the second and lower tier thrash acts to try their hands at a more mall-accessible brand of heaviness, but virtually every effort I've heard from this band has felt like a dull slap in the face with a side of stale, bruised beef.\n\nTo be fair, Burn My Eyes is at least someone in touch with its thrashing foundations. Flynn and crew were unquestionably listening to bands like Biohazard and Pantera, probably also closely following the path that Brazilians Sepultura were taking, and this debut feels like someone had packed, beaten and kneaded those flavors into a rough thrash taffy by the pier. The focus is clearly on making big dumb grooves to hold the tougher audience elements' attention span, hip hop with chords and chugs, but then the band lacked the NYHC street cred, or the overbearing personality of Phil Anselmo's vocals, or Dimebag's ability to compose such sticky riffs. Burn My Eyes gets some credit for me though in how Machine Head manages to balance off its dynamics and give the meatheadedness some atmosphere. Part of this is accomplished by having such strongly produced drums, they really thunder around here and make even the more primal and predictable riffs stir the blood more than I'd have otherwise expected. Adam Duce's bass-lines sound pretty good throughout the album, thick as a brick. The shouted vocals are also well mixed to tap into the caveman genes, and they do occasionally manage to alternate some other tempos into the 'jump da fuc up' riffs which are probably the money shots the band and Roadrunner were counting on. There's also a little tendency to incorporate some mechanical higher pitched guitar lines in to flesh out the groove, I'm occasionally reminded of Prong circa 1990-1994, although Tommy Victor was far better at writing good music.\n\nI mean if you just got out the gym back in the mid 90s, grabbed a copy of this over at Tower Records and had a little testosterone left to channel, I can imagine that the gut punching duo of the singles \"Davidian\" and \"Old\" would have been the best thing ever! Unless of course that you already had been listening to metal music for any length of time before that and realized that the aggression in the medium doesn't always need to be so tailor fit toward its most shallow instincts. Flynn tries to spin a lot of the tough guy sustain on his vocal lines, but he's just never had the bravado of Anselmo, or perhaps it's that he was lacking the Southern accent that put Phil over the top. He actually sounds like he's half-way between THAT Phil, and another Phil, Rind of Sacred Reich. The rappy vocals on songs like \"A Thousand Lies\" were mirroring Biohazard, but in that case lack some of the goofier beefcake charm of those topless, chiseled Brooklyn brutes; and a few of the cleaner lines seem like they lack confidence, as in \"None But My Own\" where they sound sort of drugged and dopey. Guitars grooves here like the breakdown in \"None but My Own\" sound like they're just doing their best to mimic stuff from A Vulgur Display of Power, although I'll cut some slack in that the very structure, mechanistic patterns seem to live up to their namesake.\n\nThe lyrics are far from the worst I've read from a lot of the groove metal bands of the 90s, but still just a combination of pretty obvious cliches about personal suffering and strengthening with some topical remnants of the 80s thrash that the band grew out of. The cover artwork is awful; is this weird blurred out guy copulating with the person in front him, or is that supposed to be the same dude head banging hard and being caught in various positions of the act? Whatever the answer, bro, it definitely makes me want to burn out my own eyes, so I can't blame Machine Head for false advertising there.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI will admit Machine Head was the jam during my high school years. I loved \"The Blackening,\" and \"Unto the Locust\" and were one of the bands that fueled my love for metal. However, Machine Head noticeably dipped in quality and that became noticeable in the single \"Is There Anybody Out There?\" A single written after Robby Flynn witnessed the controversy of Phillip Anselmo shouting \"White Power\" on stage with a nazi salute. That's right! Rather than talk to Anselmo like a mature adult, he went for a petty way of dealing with the situation. This is where \"Catharsis\" comes in. A perfect example of what not to do with your music and how turning a band with mutual contributions to the music can switch to a dictatorship attitude. Seriously, how do you fuck up an album with the purpose of revolution? I use \"Catharsis\" as an example of what not to do with your band, and what not do with your lyrics, but more on that later. This album is so insulting and terrible that I'm surprised that it wasn't banned for indecent exposure.\n\nIf there's one thing I can give credit to with \"Catharsis\" is that at least the music is trying to sound good. A lot of that is from Phil Demmel's performance in the album. Whatever remotely good happens in the music is through Phil Demmel's guitar performance and it's groovy and aggressive, but alas that is not enough to save the sinking ship that is \"Catharsis.\" Even from here, you can tell that this sounds similar to Slipknot and other nu-metal bands which honestly sound much better than this.\n\nOf course, the biggest black mark to ever happen to \"Catharsis\" is Robb Flynn himself. Phil Demmel had said in an interview that a lot of the music he wrote was great to him, but Robb Flynn managed to make things worse for them by turning those riffs and music into musical revolution. Demmel then said in a later interview that some of his music was rejected during the production of \"Catharsis.\" Not only is this showing Robb Flynn's Egotistical, selfish attitude, but quickly turned Machine Head into a solo project. This is understandable why Phil Demmel and drummer Dave McClain left the band shortly after the \"Catharsis\" tour. So Robb Flynn made this album incredibly bad after being clouded by his own ego. This is a lesson for people who are starting their own band, don't let your ego cloud your judgment and remember that a band is a team effort. \n\nThe biggest insult that \"Catharsis\" brought is in the lyrics. These are by far the worst lyrics I've ever heard in my life. These lyrics are so god awful that it makes Korn's lyrics sound sophisticated. You be the judge on how bad these lyrics really are based on the song \"Triple Beam.\"\n\n\"My dealer trusted nobody,\nmake you take a test.\nSee if you would rat him out, \nor stab him in the chest.\n\nHe'd make you suck the Glass-Dick, \ncalled it \"dragon's breath\".\nSmoke a giant hit of speed, \nprove you weren't the feds.\"\n\nApart from that barn burner, and the shitty tribute to Lemmy - \"I'm eatin' pussy by a dumpster,\nbeard stinking like snatch\" - a lot of the album is politically driven. However, it's incredibly hamfisted, poorly paced, and too blatantly obvious. He attacks Donald Trump, Kim Jong-Un, Racists, and pretty much the entire world with incoherent structure and lack of catchiness within the lyrics that are written. This album is also hypocritical because Robb Flynn (who writes this music against racism) uses racist insensitive stereotypical words like the N-Word in \"Bastards,\" Spics in \"Razorblade Smile\" and insulted California with \"California Bleeding.\" To sum it all up, this album's lyrics are insensitive, incredibly idiotic, poorly executed, and incredibly plagued with cliched, overused lines. The only positive thing to say about the lyrics is that its a perfect example of how not to write lyrics. Its quite obvious that Flynn wrote these lyrics out of rage, but the lesson here is that rage can cloud your thinking and can speed up your writing process fast. Slow and steady wins the race is half the success of writing lyrics, and unfortunately \"Catharsis\" looks like it was rushed and not well thought out. \n\nRobb Flynn's performance on this \"Catharsis\" is incredibly abysmal. He's whining in this music and sounds decrepit, and a lot of that is made worse in \"Bastards\" where he tries to sound hopeful and revolutionary, but he just sounds like he just doesn't give a shit. Whenever he uses the spoken word it's noticeable that he doesn't give a shit and comes off as laid back as opposed to proving a point. Robby Flynn sounds like he used the majority of his energy on his lyrics rather than put any effort to sound politically charged. Whenever he does use his typical aggressive sound just sounds again decrepit which also shows Flynn's age.\n\nAnother really terrible thing about \"Catharsis\" is how long it is. This clocks in at 74 minutes, making for an endurance test of who will go insane first. A lot of the political, drug-related dumbass songs are crammed together and are unnecessary for this album. In this case, less is more, and you can only fit so much into one album that isn't related to what you're talking about in an album. Especially when we live in an age where the kid's attention span is abysmal. The least Robb Flynn could have done is make it into a political concept album that way the album could have been 50 minutes long at best. Whoever listens to this album to the very end is a brave soul, because this is indeed too long then it needed to be. \n\nThe worst part about \"Catharsis\" is that it actually sold well internationally. It ended up being #3 in the Germany Charts, #4 in the Swiss Charts, #3 in the Austrian Charts, and #12 in the UK charts. This is another example of selling out your quality of music and dignity for the purpose to sell a lot of records. That seems to be the tragedy of the music industry where artistic statements and authenticity are being left out for money. Machine Head did not purposely think about their bank accounts, but this album shows how poor quality this sounds.\n\nSo what can we learn from the \"Catharsis\" fiasco? This is an album to be shown to aspiring musicians on what not to do with their music, their band, and they're lyrics and not even in a decent way. Take writing music slowly, and don't let your ego get the better of you, otherwise, you'll end up like Robby Flynn turning Machine Head into his own personal project. I have never seen a bigger fall from grace than Robby Flynn. I do give him credit to be politically driven, and revolutionary, but he screwed up Machine Head big time with this. If it wasn't for his effort to have the slightest ounce of concept, and for the rest of the band's effort trying to make it sound plausible, then I would have rated this album a 0. Half of the members left him behind which was the smart thing to do because ol' Robby Flynn might have pulled a career suicide. A man who is buried by his own ego, power, and immaturity led \"Catharsis\" to disaster and humiliation. He should have asked Bob Dylan for advice...\n",
        "\nCommon sense would seem to dictate that courting controversy and putting out thrash metal, regardless of the stylistic variant of the latter, should be a recipe for success. But in the particular case of Robb Flynn and his de facto solo project Machine Head, as the classic quote from Casino eloquently put it, \"this guy could fuck up a cup of coffee\". It isn't for a lack of ability to get the job done in the musical department that this former master of 80s thrash turned post-thrash trend-hopper continually undermines himself, but more so his ego causing him to make bad decisions in both the composition and performance department that prevent even his better creations from realizing their full potential. Case and point, the most recent single out of this band Do Or Die, a veritable exercise in reestablishing one's musical credentials following a flop LP and then canceling it all out by predicating the lyrical content of an otherwise solid thrash tune upon having skin so paper-thin that it's only visible in two dimensions.\n\nWhen discounting the two glaring flaws in this otherwise shining example of how modern groove/thrash can work wonders, namely every sound and word coming out of Flynn's mouth, this is arguably the best thing to ever come out under the Machine Head moniker. The high octane riff assault that rounds out most of this song is a sort of perfect marriage of vintage 80s Bay Area insanity out of the Vio-Lence and early Forbidden arsenal with a modern, chunky production, assaulting any would be listener at a break-neck tempo. Coupled along with this is a punishingly heavy breakdown moment after the first of multiple guitar solos that arrives seamlessly and perfectly embodies every strong moment that failed to be fully exploited on this band's mixed bag debut Burn My Eyes. Speaking of lightning speed and flashy guitar solos, additional praise ought to be thrown Flynn's way in spite of himself for tapping two highly competent musicians in lead guitarist of Decapitated fame Vogg and kit-destroyer Matt Alston of Devilment to replace Phil Demmel and Dave McClain, as both of them play their proverbial asses off.\n\nIf this song had been an instrumental, it sadly would have been better for it, because what lay on top of this otherwise stellar return to form can be best described as the most cringe-worthy, mealy-mouthed pile of word salad under the guise of lyrics. As best as can be explained, Flynn apparently hasn't gotten all of the homeboy out of his system following the disastrous nu-metal flop that was last year's Catharsis, arguably the worst album to come out of the American heavy metal scene in 2018 save Ministry's decrepit attempt at political pandering minus any degree of musical intrigue AmeriKKKant (the fuck does an 18th century German philosopher have to do with the KKK any way, Al?), and has even gone so far as to up the ante by trying to ape today's mumble-rap craze (hence the popular meme Flynn Shady). Suffice to say, Flynn still can't carry a tune to save his own life, but has managed to make matters even worse by throwing a whiny rant of novella proportions over top of a solid thrash tune, virtually canceling out what would have been a full on thrash assault.\n\nAgainst all better judgment, the only thing that can be said with regard to this sad excuse of a lyrical counter-punch at Flynn's critics is to offer some words of wisdom to someone who has already committed himself to the contrary. \"Do Or Die\" is a song that suffers from a massive identity crisis primarily because its author has been suffering from one ever since the mid-1990s, the only remedy for this for all of the liabilities in this band's formula to be stripped away and replaced with a more stylistically consistent approach, or to put it more plainly, Rob Flynn needs to hire a real vocalist, knock off writing lyrics completely, and either decide whether he wants to write nu-metal or thrash tunes, because the two cannot coexist together. Absent this, he might do well to take a different lyrical approach and maybe try his hand at returning to something vocally along the lines of what was done on Unto The Locust. And if any remnant Flynn apologists or the man himself wishes any further convincing, they would do well to consider that at present, Phil Anselmo is a considerably superior lyricist and vocalist, contemplate that on the tree of woe before hanging yourself from it.\n",
        "\nThe newest style pivot by Machine Head (or, for a more realistic band name, Robb Flynn and Paid Associates) feels so fucking disingenuous, possibly even moreso than all their other past style changes. Yeah, Machine Head have never been a band you couldn't accuse of trend hopping in search of greater mainstream recognition, but considering how terrible Catharsis was and how poorly received by literally everybody it was, going back to a pretty straightforward thrash metal sound was both kind of expected and totally hollow and meaningless. Machine Head are a band that fans of will swallow up no matter what, detractors will despise regardless of the quality of their music, and they'll remain a top billed name in metal because we as a society are not allowed to have nice things. Speaking as somebody who used to be greatly into Machine Head as a teenager and fell out of interest with them as time went on, this just reeks of desperation on Robb's part to try and get some goodwill back after the unmitigated disaster that the last album was, which means thrashy guitars and fast drums, but Robb Flynn's gonna Robb Flynn whether you like it or not, and that means we get RAPPING VERSES in the year 2019 with the most cringeworthy lyrics imaginable.\n\nFrom a musical standpoint, Do or Die is short, sweet, and to the point, a sub-four minute thrasher that feels like an outtake from The Blackening, the album that brought Machine Head back to prominence in 2007. The main riff is every safe, generic, modern thrash riff you've ever heard, broken up by gallops and power chords because we can't get too extreme, now can we? Not like you can really hear the riff that well because of Robb's rapping, but we'll get there. It doesn't rip all the way through though, the riffing and d-beat drumming broken up by the obligatory \"We need a breakdown in here because people still eat that shit up for some reason and it'll sound good live\" section about two minutes in, but it's thankfully brief, going only eight measures before heading into the guitar solo. It's a quite nice twin lead too, unfortunately wasted in the mire that is modern day Machine Head. Still, in spite of (or possibly because of) its cookie cutter nature, it's the most inspired thing Machine Head have made since Unto the Locust, since the band are only ever good at making groovy, thrash-ish stuff anyway, yet it all feels like a front put on trying to camouflage a main writer that is incapable of making anything genuinely inspired or from the heart anymore (Eternal Nightmare was 31 years ago, and Robb ain't ever participating in anything to that level ever again, I can assure you).\n\nI'll say it right now: Robb Flynn is a fucking goober. I say that because only a completely self-unaware, self-serious goober like him could write lyrics like this without a hint of irony, spit them out with total sincerity, and release them in 2019. You just know he feels like he's dripping with Big Brain Energy while rapping about how \"There's not a metal band I ain't influenced\" (a clearly demonstrable fallacy if I've ever heard one) and railing against haters and the memes they make about him on the internet. Look at how much better he says he is than the haters, people! Give me a fucking break. This is basically the metal song equivalent of a temper tantrum. I mean, the dude says the word \"fuck\" TWENTY NINE TIMES in this song. Hey Robb, Slipknot called collect from the year 2000. They want their lyrical crutch back. While at least this song isn't spoken word slam poetry with totally unnecessary n-bomb droppings in it, it really isn't all that much better. They say to not feed the trolls online and not letting the dumb shit people say get to you, and this guy literally wrote an entire song feeding the trolls and railing about how the dumb shit people say doesn't get to him. That's Sonic Syndicate's MO, Robb, and don't you DARE steal it from them!\n\nSo yeah, I really don't have much more to say about this. This song is phony nonsense from a phony, nonsensical band, fronted by a dude that doesn't understand that, hey, not saying anything is sometimes the considerably better option. The more I think and write about it, the lower the score goes. Don't listen to this, and ignore future Machine Head for the good of your ears.\n",
        "\nLine-up changes seem to help MH somehow. Sadly, nothing can help Robb Flynn. This song is the perfect illustration of what I am saying. Previous single was an acoustic version of the song that was already released as Flynn\u2019s solo project like 6 years ago. Now meet and greet Do Or Die.\n\nJust hearing this song fueled me with determination to write something. I don\u2019t know if this is about song quality or about me being annoyed by life. In any case, for now, I am going to ignore vocals and lyrics no matter how \u201cfantastic\u201d they are. Let\u2019s talk guitars. Guitar sound finally hits the mark. It\u2019s pounding, groovy, with deeper tone which sounds more hateful and contrasts well with pale jaded vocal performance. I\u2019ve listened to some of their older material and I might even go as far as saying that guitars sound as strong and convincing as on The Blackening. Here they have better low-end, while the aforementioned album has more distinct mid-tone coil whine to its guitar passages. The chorus on Do Or Die might make you turn away with its simplicity. If you get through, you meet something that someone who knows Machine Head is familiar with- Unto The Locust. Riff reminds me of This Is The End from UTL. And I would say that\u2019s a good thing. guitar Picking part going into your typical groovy roar which is less present on UTL. Solo is nice without complex guitar dueling. At least guitar players are satisfied. We will see for how long they will play in MH. \n\nDrums are great. I just can\u2019t help but love D-beat. double bass intensifies closer to the end of the song and it makes for a wonderful peak of speed and pummeling. Sound itself is a bit to shallow for my taste. Enough to cause subjective complaints but not enough to call it downright bad. Everything works. The same can be said about bass guitar. You get a great look at how bass is getting by in solo part. No aggression and no stupid distortion. Distortion is only used at the very end on Flynn\u2019s vocals. I guess I have to say something about vocals and lyrics.\n\nLyrics are fucking atrocious. Our old friend once again decided that people just don\u2019t understand MH. On top of it- \u201cdie motherfucker die\u201d is not exactly the freshest line to say as the main song hook. And you know what is the other catchy hook here7 \u201cI am fucked up in the head\u201d. Ironically, this could be true. Maybe we shall gather some mental help for Robb. I laugh like a crazy maniac whenever I hear this bark. How fake and plastic it all sounds on top of actually superb musicianship and production. \n\nI have two theories on why this song is rather good. Either Flynn is bouncing back after negative reception of Catharsis or new musicians are not yet oppressed by him. Waiting for another single to confirm one of the two.\n",
        "\nI'm a long time Machine Head fan, and have realized how hit and miss this band can really be, especially with their release last year. But this track seems to deviate from that style instrumentally, given everything in this department is actually top notch, even in comparison to tracks from 'The Blackening'. The riffs and drum patterns sound closer to something from that album, and even a cross from 'The More Things Change', and the production is really clean. Even Robb's vocals sound impressive, with a lot of aggression present. But that's where the problems begin, because the lyrics are incredibly cringe-worthy.\n\nI honestly don't know what Robb was thinking, with lyrics such as :\n\n'I don't give a fuck about your stupid little scene\nReaction videos and all your pussy little memes'\n\nIt just makes no sense that he was able to write such brilliant lyrical content in earlier albums, but here, it just sounds like an edgy teenager who hates their parents, as well as people on the internet. Also, the chorus sounds like its a parody of Dope's 'Die MF Die'. \n\nOverall, I like the direction the band's headed in musically, and I hope they release more with this as the core sound, minus the lyrical content. With Vogg being the new guitarist, there does seem to be some hope for the band's future.\n",
        "\nThis is definitely something weird for Machine Head to put out at the point in time the band was at. They started out as pure groove metal on their debut Burn My Eyes, then introduced some other elements with their second album The More Things Change... , but this album was very unexpected for everybody. They went nu metal out of nowhere. A huge majority of Machine Head fans and other people generally hate this record because again, they changed genres so quickly and unexpectedly.\n\nI can definitely understand why people would hate this and all that. It's lackluster nu metal coming from a groove band that this album spawned randomly. I get it. If I were to sum this up for those of you who don't understand, think of Sepultura. Think about Beneath the Remains, then think of Roots, that's pretty much it. But people seriously have to stop saying \"NU METAL BAD THIS ALBUM SUCKS\" etc, all that shit is purley just idiotic and stubborn. The Burning Red is definitely a step down that panders to the mainstream, but the songs are actually pretty good.\n\nI wouldn't say Machine Head are great with pure nu metal, but the material offered here is pretty solid. Mainly the tracks From This Day and Desire to Fire. From This Day is easily a nu metal song. Just everything, the guitars, the drum playing, and the rap-ish vocals that back it all up. Also this song generally feels like a Korn song, they mix nu metal mainstream-ness with a little bit of heaviness as well. I don't know how to further explain it but From This Day is a very good song. Desire to Fire is the first track off this album and it just starts amazing. It has an intro that builds up very good and the riff is just outstanding. This is seriously one of the greatest riffs the band has ever written, this is stuck in my head all the time. Extremely catchy song for sure. These two songs in particular are the best this album offers compared to other songs.\n\nThe songwriting is okay for nu metal, could've been better for sure, but this isn't all that bad. All of the songs have something interesting and different about thierselves and they all have catchy and memorable parts too. Every track has a little something. \n\nAll the songs on this album are catchy (for the most part) and has good riffs. The inventive drumming creates an epic bouncy groove with the nu-styled riffs. Every track here is somewhat memorable; and again, catchy. Once you get more familiar with this album a lot of the tracks will be stuck in your head. Best part of this entire album is the inventive drumming that goes along with the presented riff. Greatness!\n\nThe bad parts about this album is that some aspects take the whole nu metal thing a tad too far. For example the 2nd song opens up kinda heavy, then has a few sections where the guitar stops playing and it's just the bass and drums playing together making a dancy beat with Robb rapping over it. These parts should be scrapped. I understand these parts is what makes nu metal \"nu\", but these specific areas of the songs that some songs have makes the song less great. Also, the intro track and the last track. This album doesn't need an intro, Enter the Phoenix is worthless and unnecessary. Desire to Fire already opens up amazingly and has an awesome buildup, so there's no need for Enter the Phoenix to be there at all. The title track (at the end of the album) is also just seriously unnecessary and boring as can be. I know its supposed to be inventive/an ending or whatever, the song generally isn't terrible; it's just so boring and not needed. All the songs on here have energy and are catchy, moving, etc. To have it end with a lame interlude-type track is a bad idea. Why? Beats me. \n\nThe Burning Red is generally and genuinely a good album. People need to stop giving it so much crap simply because it's nu metal, there's always something good in something that's not good. All the Machine Head hate in general just needs to stop, it's incredibly annoying and very stubborn. Obviously there's been a HUGE change in comparison to their two previous albums, but everything deserves a chance no matter how bad it is or how bad it may seem. Listen to the damn music and don't just play one song/skim the album and then proceed to call it \"crap\".\n\nOnce you get used to the songs on here you'll start to enjoy it alot and remember them. Some tracks on here simply are nostalgic for me and make me feel great on the inside, I swear some of the stuff on here is pretty magical. \n\nSo yeah, this is a Machine Head album that took an unexpected twist and it's pretty weird and whatever, but I'm telling you, if you take the time to listen to every single track and evaluate and closely listen to this entire album, it will grow on you, at some point it will. You'll realize that this album; despite it being mainstream-focused, isn't bad. It's alright. Its good. It's awesome. You just have to make yourself become more familiar with it. Instead of shitting on Machine Head and this album because it's nu metal and cringe, how about you just take some time to actually listen to it? It's not that hard.\n",
        "\nMachine Head is a tragedy of an act. Birthed from the ashes of Vio-Lence, and armed with the potential to be a force in their selected path, they must have seemed like a major player in the new wave of no-bullshit, teeth grinding, shit kicker metal in the 90's, and moving forward.\n\nBut let's call a spade a spade. Machine Head has always been the undisputed kings of trend-hopping, riding the coattails of far more talented artists, and buying into whatever fads and ideas are prevailing in society at any given time. Take one look at their discography at-large (at your own discretion) and the writing is on the walls. And you won't witness this more clearly than on their so-called record, \"Catharsis\".\n\nThe ringleader of this circus, Robb Flynn, has outdone himself on this (lack of) effort. From attacking the \"bigoted\" metal scene, and world at large, with unabashed finger-pointing, to once more steering his merry band of miscreants in the musical direction of a Dropkick Murphy's cover band in a local dive bar, this collection of glorified slam poetry can only be characterized as a grown man's futile attempt to relate to the growing movement of social justice and pseudo-political discord among the college youth of the age. \n\nPseudo-symbolic racial slurs (that he swore he'd never say), contrived song structure from the ground level on up, and an atmosphere caked thick with delusion, you've got a real piece of work here. You know you've reached a creative black hole when your goal is to be edgy to sell records. Apparently, their nu-metal mentality never left after \"Supercharger\". I won't go into any song specifics, because there is nothing of merit to report. Multiple attempts at digging for a proverbial light in the dark have fallen flat time and time again. If Machine Head ever \"had it\", they lost it, and lost it hard. It's a shame, too. This record ended up being Phil Demmel and Dave McClain's swansong with the band, the two members who actually have talent. Overall, it's probably for the best. You've got to abandon ship when you have the chance, especially when it's sinking this fast. \n\nIf there is anything remotely redeemable about this record, it's that \"Catharsis\" will stand as an example of what NOT to do with your band. The concept of revolution for the sake of revolution is laughable, especially coming from an aging man who is suffocated by his own hypocrisy at every turn. This is the memoir of Robb Flynn, a man who wishes he was his more successful peers, and attempts to christen himself as divine to compensate. In his own eyes, he can do no wrong, and he's out to call the world out on it's bullshit that he swears he has never perpetuated. Forget your gods or countries, put your faith in him. This act works on high school kids who don't know any better, and it's mildly depressing to imagine anyone over the age of eighteen taking a second of this, or him, seriously. \n\n\"Catharsis\". A front-runner for one of the worst albums of all-time, from a front-runner for one of the most laughable bands of all-time. Avoid at all costs.

        "\nMachine Head is one of the most famous and controversial bands belonging to the NWOAHM; their enormous commercial success, and the fact that they belong to the often criticized genre of groove metal, made them the favourite target of a wide branch of metal purists and elitists. Considered Machine Head's comeback after their baleful nu-metal influenced phase, \"The Blackening\" is the band's sixth full-length release, and it's also one of their absolute best, along with their debut album \"Burn My Eyes\". \n\nSpeaking in terms of musicianship, this album is breathtaking: the songs are extremely long (often exceeding the nine-minutes mark), intricate and elaborate, without resulting over pretentious or painful to listen; the relentless, incredibly technical riffing flows through each track of the album, providing variety, originality and entertaining the listener thanks to the guitarists' virtuosism; the sessions featuring distorted guitars and aggressive vocals are complemented by clean/effected guitar sessions, matched by clean, melodic singing; there is a perfect balance between fast-tempo parts and slower, even heavier ones. As a result, the whole product feels varied, yet cohesive and consonant as a whole.\n\nThe fantastic guitar riffs rely mainly on the use of the low strings, and feature pinch hamonics, fast scales, chords, palm muting; the duo of downtuned guitars offers also tasty breakdowns and some memorable melodies, not to mention the mindblowing performance of fantastic soloing: just think to the alternated guitar leads in \"Clenching The Fists Of Dissent\" or \"Halo\"; the bass has plenty of time to shine, thanks to the interesting lines and the relevance it gets in the clean sessions; the drumming is precise, powerful and full of interesting fills, and the vocal performance offered by Robb Flynn is as violent, passionate and consistent as ever. Each band member literally goes all out, resulting in a fantastic general performance. The production sounds exquisitely modern and balanced: spot on the crunchy, thick guitar tone, and the overlayered vocals.\n\nThe songs own an almost progressive feel, four of them being incredible epics. Each of the eight tracks is so well-crafted, that it would deserve a special mention. Album opener \"Clenching The Fists Of Dissent\" starts off with a long, acoustic intro, somehow reminescent of the 1984-1988 era Metallica, and flows into a total thrash banger, thanks to the aggressive, superb riffing, the fast tempo, and Robb's rabid vocals; the song then slows down, featuring clean, melodic vocals, and then exploding into a breakdown, that paves the way to the glorious finale. Spot on the guitar solos dueling too. \"Halo\" features an heavy, almost nu-metalish riff, while \"Aesthetics Of Hate\" rages against the article written by William Grim for the website \"Iconoclast\" praising the murderer of Dimebag Darrell. Finally, \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d spectacularly closes the album with a dramatic reflection about war and the politicians who promote it.\n\n\"The Blackening\" is surely the most ambitious, elaborate, eclectic and complex output by Machine Head. Haters gonna hate, but the facts remain: the songwriting and the musicianship to be found on this record are some of the finest you'll ever get to hear on a modern metal album. Don't miss it, and give it a chance if you haven't done it already: you won't be disappointed.\n",
        "\n\"Misunderstood\"\n\nThat word. It is the one thing that has plagued me for all of these years (I'm 35 now) about Machine Head. Particularly this specific era of their music. And believe me I for the longest time was in the same boat as everyone else on this website about Machine Head's debut \"Burn My Eyes.\" It's a polarizing album that you either love unconditionally or loathe with a passion. It's also an album that represents a certain time period but a sub-genre that had the guts, had the glory, went the distance yet somehow....didn't live up to the heights it was so delusional and grandiose about. Groove Metal. Post-Thrash. Half-Thrash. Whatever you want to call it, it certainly couldn't have came out of the 80's that's for sure. It came from a time period where everything was awkward, weird, growing, changing, alienated, and different. A musical puberty. Much like myself as I came of age as a teen in the mid to late 90's. Maybe, and I'm not a psychologist, that's why I fucking hated this album so much was that it represented a era of really angsty music that was just screaming \"Fuck You Dad!\" for so long that it forgot that it NEEDED to grow MORE before reaching a certain level of maturity. Because being 14-16 years old doesn't last forever. If it does then either get your T-levels checked or get some much needed therapy. I personally was not an angsty lil' shit trying to get into a fist-fight with old man so that one big reason why this didn't click with me then. Before I get into any sort of positive wording about either the band or their debut, let's go straight into the complaint department and hash through some major bullshit that I will call out on the existence of the band and album. It personally just makes it easier to deal with for the most part.\n\nThe biggest reason/complaint I have about Machine Head and their debut was based on one particular front man, Robb Flynn. His personality and ability to basically incorporate and ride whatever trend is happening at the moment as well as throwing his own friends and musical colleagues under the bus for social media likes and shit, is fucking deplorable. That and the dude who has since become a poor man's version of Corey Taylor who doesn't know when to shut the fuck up has been revisioning his very own past every album cycle since \"Burn My Eyes\"( hell if you wanna go into specifics, the dude has been revisioning himself the second he left his former and better band Vio-lence) meaning whatever is popular at the moment, he will try and fool his very own audience just to stay in the spotlight. Just recently he said something to the effect of (go look it up on Blabbermouth.net, it's all there in black and white in his own words) \"Machine Head were wanting to be the ultimate jam band like the Grateful Dead. We thought at one point we were the heaviest band on the face of the earth. But then Fear Factory and Korn came out and stole our crown.\" BULLSHIT ROBB! In 1994, Pantera was at #1 on the Top 200 Album Charts. Norway was burning to the ground with Black Metal. Florida Death Metal was at it's commercial peak. Napalm Death were signed to Sony, and not to mention Paradise Lost was infecting the UK their their Gothic Doom Metal sounds. Fear Factory actually existed and came out before you existed and were doing some serious innovation to Industial Metal. And last I checked motherfucker, you were trying to sound like a west coast version of Bio-Hazard with Pantera throwaway riffs! Let's not forget that you essentially gave up after your 2nd album because of lack-luster reviews and you completely copied and aped Korn's sound. So cut the candy-coated bullshit and admit to the fact that your perception of your very own past is completely different than what the actual reality was. And last but not least, only the European Metal mags in 1994 gave you basically ANY sort of coverage just because that the UK at the time didn't have their own Groove Metal band to call their own so they adopted you as some red-headed bastard stepchild. Also there is the thing where if you look in the actual CD booklet of this album in the Thanks List, there's a phrase that perfectly describes the nature of Robb in 1994 where it says in black and white: \"...and for all of those with a lack in respect or faith, you have nothing to look forward to but the downtown Oaktown beatdown!\" Ooooooooooh. Oaktown? Please. Mr. New Orleans called your sawft inner city-wannabe ass out and showed you what happens when you fuck around with the dirty South. Leave the tough guy and alpha male tendencies to someone who actually IS an alpha male and not a coattail rider, Robb.\n\nThe 2nd beef I have is the fact that Robb Flynn came from one of the best damn Bay Area Thrash Metal bands, Vio-lence, who made 2 albums and 1 E.P. full of some of the best ass-ripping 80's thrash metal riffs this side of the Atlantic Ocean. To see him go from that to.....aping Bio-Hazard breakdowns and Pantera riffs.....it fucking just completely waffled me. Like \"WHY?!?! WTF is the matter with you Robb?!?!\" After actually sitting down and listening to the entire album all the way through, everything started to make sense of why he would change direction as far as musical output goes. And it wasn't just him. Quite a number other musicians from the thrash metal genre started to go the route of Pantera and getting into the groove of the 90's. Sepultura did it. Dave Lombardo did it with Grip Inc. Warrel Dane(RIP) of Sanctuary left for Nevermore. Forbidden even wrote an album or so of groove-oriented material. Hell, even both Prong and White Zombie both started out as bands completely different by the time they found their very own mainstream success with groovy metal tunes did it as well. May be everyone in the Thrash Metal genre said collectively \"We've done as much as we could with speed. Napalm Death ended the race as far as pushing the boundaries and out-doing us in the extreme department. Let's go a different direction and see where that leads us. Hell, if Pantera is having success, then why not us?\" If one is expecting \"Burn My Eyes\" to be a thrash metal album, forget it. Look elsewhere. Go listen to Demolition Hammer or classic Kreator or Dark Angel. \"Burn My Eyes\" was waaaay over-hyped by the UK Metal media and seen originally as a true and blue thrash album. Close but no fucking cigar Kerrang Magazine and Metal Hammer! Had they not have mislabeled \"Burn My Eyes\" and called it for what it is, a groove metal album, maybe this album would not have been so despised by thrash metal fans at the time. May be I would have warmed up to it better in the past. If you listen to \"Burn My Eyes\" and do not try to look for anything thrash, it makes way more sense. Let's not forget the other musicians here. If anything, THOSE are the gentlemen that really shine through. Looking past the overly self-inflated egotistic nature of this album and it's dickheaded singer....drummer Kris Kontos(ex-Verbal Abuse/Attitude Adjustment) lays down some solid drumming. Guitarist Logan Madder and Bassist Adam Duce don't get the credit they deserve for providing the back-up that Robb Flynn needed. In reality this was the best line-up Machine Head had going. If this was all just Rob Flynn, this would have more or less sank into obscurity. If anything, it's the rest of the band that saves this album by deflecting the attention away from Robb Flynn.\n\nNow that I have gotten that out of the way, I've decided to go on a track-by-track review because honestly this is one album that needs that treatment here on this site. So many other albums get said treatment. Most of them don't offer a sense of keeping one's attention. Most of them honestly are boring and don't convince me to listen to the album or I've already listened to the album and found the review completely different than what I experienced. Again music is subjective. Let me repeat that: MUSIC IS SUBJECTIVE. You may not agree with me on this album, I might not agree with you on this album. But this is one where I feel that in defense of a new found reconsideration for it, that applying a fine tooth and comb to it will help bring some of the better qualities and characteristics of this album to light and let it be historically seen as not something that it was trying to be but wasn't; basically a misunderstood album made by a well-rounded group of musicians with a frontman that in the end was trying to push the boundaries of groove metal but had to go through the pitfalls and ups and downs of an entire career to see his own vision come to life. Essentially I am giving this my own version of Decibel Magazine's very own \"Justify Your Shitty Taste In Music\" feature. So until Decibel decides if it's ever going to do any sort of spotlight on this album and give this particular devil it's due for the current generation of metal fans here in the state, then I guess I'll be the first to put this baby to rest. Let's go through the track list and see what to make of this now that I have a more open-mind:\n\n1). Davidian - The first single and Machine Head's most well-known song. And it's one that I find beyond overrated. For one the sound of the double-bass on this song just irks me the wrong way. It sounds flat as fuck. If it was trying to be a triggered sound, then it failed right then and there. The opening breakdown is an annoying build-up to a crap load of double-bass that really doesn't go anywhere. If anything the saving grace of this song is based on the build-up to the ending breakdown of the song. Robb could have saved himself the time and pressure and just built a song around the breakdown and it would have been way more competent and consistent. \n\n2). Old - This is the better of the 2 singles that came from this album. If anything this song is some of the best riffs that Pantera never really got around to writing. The dynamics work way better as well as the chorus is less annoying than Robb screaming something about a shotgun blast and freedom and shit. In fact this is the first time we here Robb's melodic singing during the chorus and honestly, it's not bad. Almost like a shouted-baritone style. For a 2nd single off this album, start with this one than \"Davidian.\"\n\n3). A Thousand Lies - Now we hear where the Bio-Hazard influence comes in. Especially when it goes into that jumpdafuckup riff and Robb Flynn starts rapping about who-the-fuck-knows what. You wanna see what this song is like in actual life? Just go onto ol' Youtube and watch old footage of Donnigton '94 music fest where Machine Head are playing this song and Robb Flynn is doing wiggerish hand movements in trying to get the crowd to jumpdafuckup in 1994. This song is a complete throwaway. Just skip this song all together.\n\n4). None But My Own - A more straight-forward song much like \"Old\" with Robb Flynn trying to do this weird Grunge-style melodic singing in between the main groovy riff which actually builds into a really nice thrashy double-bass ending. This song is the start of the 2nd act of the album where it starts to get way better, more interesting and more consistent as far as quality of the songs and lesser complaints and grievances. \n\n5). The Rage To Overcome - This song basically feels like a second half to the previous track. Not much to say other than it doesn't suck. \n\n6). Deathchurch - I read somewhere that Robb Flynn basically described this song as a tribute to the almighty Godflesh. I can see and hear it. It's essentially taken the industrial and extreme sounds out of a Godflesh song and just focuses on the riffs. It's here where Robb Flynn does a good job in creating mood and vocally he's not whiny and actually feels authentic. As far as all the songs off this album go, this is my personal favorite. Also remember how I mentioned that if \"Davidian\" was all based on the ending breakdown it would be a better song? Originally \"Davidian\" was based around the main riff in \"Deathchurch\", only Robb wanted to make a faster version.....as the old saying goes, if it aint broke, don't fix it. Also the lyrics \"Hey Jesus can you help me with my pain, mainline me some religion to keep me sane\" is pretty damn catchy. Hell I can even see that used as a slogan for a bumper sticker for my car.\n\n7). A Nation On Fire - This goes back to the mixture of groove riffs, mood, and keeping the song straight-forward as they can possibly be. This song is identical to \"None But My Own\" which is a total build-up to a thrashy ending which sets you up for the next song.\n\n8). Blood For Blood - This is the ONLY song on this album that resembles an actual thrash metal song and feels like the last bit of Vio-lence-era riffs left in Robb Flynn. It's an ass-kicker. It doesn't let-up either. Seeing what he does on this song makes you wonder what would have been had he had done saaaaay 2 or 3 more songs like this and cut-out the rest of the few songs that make the first act of this album come off as 2 seconds away from trying to sound like a Pantera/Bio-Hazard aggro-fest gone bad. In fact had he done that, this would have deserved to have been called a thrash metal album. But having one actual fast song song doesn't qualify an album to be 100% thrash. That's a big misconception and a topic that I wont bother go into because I don't want to go too far off the topic at hand. \n\n9). I'm Your God Now - Again, another song that could have been titled \"None But My Own.\" It's what....3rd song that has followed damn near the same formula of moody Grunge-influenced melody with Robb Flynn doing his best soft melodic singing and then goes into a mid-tempo groove riff, then more Grunge-style singing then ends with a faster tempo riff? I guess this is where the phrase \"get into the groove of things\" really comes into fruition because at this final act of \"Burn My Eyes,\" the album is faaaaar fucking better and more interesting than the first 3 songs combined. \n\n10). Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies - Basically an instrumental filled with a bunch of samples that deal with crime, police brutality, military, etc. Imagine a Fear Factory song off \"Demanufacture\" minus the intensity and the layering of industrial and electronic sounds and what you get is a basic instrumental that deals with social topics of crime and corruption. It's also noted that this this song is a strong indication of what Robb's political beliefs are. Not that I'm trying to divert the topic of discussion but as a side note if people are just NOW noticing how much of a lefty ol' Robb is, then it's obviously they didn't listen to this instrumental and hear the song \"This country needs to go under a radical change.\" Food for thought. \n\n11). Block - Originally titled \"Fuck It All\" in demo form, this song is as groove metal as groove metal gets. Pantera riffs and Bio-Hazard breakdowns a plenty. And it's not that bad. It's actually catchy-as-shit. Speaking of demo version, the guitar tone on that was waaaaay more thrash metal sounding. If Machine Head had kept the guitar sound on their demo instead of it feeling so overly polished on \"Burn My Eyes\", \"Burn My Eyes\" would have been a different beast all-together. Possibly something more akin to Sepultura's \"Chaos AD.\" If you are listening to this album with an open mind like I do and have reached this point, by now everything will start to make sense.\n\nOne last point or 'myth' about this album that I truly think is the biggest myth is this notion that \"Burn My Eyes\" supposedly 'saved' metal in the 90's. How in the ever-living blue fuck did it? I grew up in the 90's. I was actually there and I distinctly remember asking my very own friends in school when I started to inquire about Machine Head and how they sounded and what their status they had because I for one never saw nor heard all of this astronomical acclaim it got supposedly (by the media). In fact any and all answers were more or less the same \"Yeah, they're aight I guess. I would rather listen to Pantera.\" So the next time you read something from I dunno, Loudwire, Blabbermouth, Kerrang Magazine, Metal Hammer.....whenever they do some Member Berries-induced \"Top 100 90's Albums Of All Time\" in order to appeal to dumbfounded and unknowing millennials who has zero clue or were actually around long enough to remember the 90's, just remember: you heard it here first folks. \n\nAnd there you have it. A complete breakdown(no pun intended) of an album that the vast majority on this website despises. Hopefully I have elaborated on certain reasons why it's been hated and despised for so long. And I think that after all this time, someone needed to actually go into detail into why this album gets a lot of flak but also go into specific reason why it SHOULDN'T get a lot of flak. I think if anything, at least on a personal level, time itself is looking back on this album and seeing it for what it was and not what it tried to be. And with that it's made me think back and reflect at my own 16 year old version of myself. Case in point: The 90's were a weird and awkward time for anyone who came or age or grew-up as a late teen. It was even worse if you were into Metal. This album at the end of the day was another exercise in escapism. Much like 90's Metal or anything that stinky, sweaty teenage boys enjoyed in the 90's. For teens like me it was black Metal, and obscure horror films. Running around with an inverted cross necklace, a Darkthrone \"Under A Funeral Moon\" shirt and a shaved head and wallet chain. For others this album may have helped them escape the fact that all they wanted to do was get into a rowdy fist-fight with Dad in the trailer park and do wiggerish hand movements while demanding \"fuckin' respect' or whatever was the suite to follow around 1994-1998. I'm sure that for all intents and purposes I looked just as fucking corny to Machine Head fans just as fucking corny and stupid as they appeared to me with their choice in bands and fashion Whatever your choice of poison was.....it was the 90's. Let's just all be thankful that those weird adolescent years are long gone. As it stands now, \"Burn My Eyes\" finds a nice little comfy spot in my music collection as some reminder of those misunderstood adolescent years. And I'm not even ashamed of it truth be told.\n\nP.S. FUCK YOU DAD!\n",
        "\nIt's often noted how much I have long despised the band Machine Head. Hell I just documented that with my review for their 1994 debut \"Burn My Eyes.\" Now I have decided to take a jab and give props to Machine Head's sophomore album \"The More Things Change...\". In all honesty, my theory is that Robb Flynn throughout the course of his career has always tried to perfect his \"thinking man's groove metal\" which actually is another way of saying \"Lemme try to appeal as much as I can to mainstream Metal fans in hopes of obtaining the same success as Pantera.\" In that he was original and creative enough to keep in-taking so many mainstream influences that it DID keep him in the spotlight despite if it was positive OR negative attention. If that makes any sense because quite frankly for the most part, ol' Robb doesn't make sense. For now let's not go too far into HIS career. \"The More Things Change...\" is the sophomore album that even Robb Flynn for the longest time hated....wait. Robb Flynn hated this album? That's weird because 99.9% of the time Robb Flynn has hyped the shit out of every single thing he has done, with the major exception for this particular album. He cited the growing tension in the band, pressure to churn out another \"Burn My Eyes\" and recording of this album as well a bad album sales for the year 1997 not being to kind to him. If that is said to be the case, then \"The More Things Change...\" was his accidental masterpiece. Not something I would put in some Hall Of Fame, but as far as the most concrete offering that only Robb could create, it was his best. Too bad he's acted like an ungrateful father to one of his offspring. \n\n\"The More Things Change...\" really feels like Machine Head at their most authentic. If there was a moment where Robb Flynn came across as genuinely pissed-off or need to be taken serious for once, it's this album. I don't know how and I don't know why on this particular album considering that many claim of the foreshadowing Nu-metal tendencies it has. This album really doesn't come off as such and the so-called Nu-metal tendencies are actually minimal. For one the tough guy Bio-Hazard/Pantera over usage of \"Burn My Eyes\" seems to be toned down a lot to where it actually gives the album the freedom and ability to really let the moodiness of the middle part of the \"Burn My Eyes\" album and become much more concise and at times....experimental. Not the bad kind, but here we get a sense of a musician who is continuing with the same influences as his first offering but is now starting to tweak it more to his advantage. Certain elements found on \"Burn My Eyes\" that Robb Flynn and company are shockingly improved on and focused more. The alternative metal/grunge melodies heard in \"None But My Own,\" \"The Rage To Overcome,\" and \"A Nation On Fire\" are more of a focal point with whatever random breakdown or double-bass groove is not only more in the background. But when you finally notice them, the ebb and flow of the alternating characteristics that Machine Head (along with others) that have helped define work better.\n\nThe line-up for \"The More Things Change...\" did have one slight difference and that being original drummer Kris Kontos (Ex-Attitude Adjustment/Verbal Abuse) left the band and was replaced by Dave McClain. I'll say right off the bat that Dave's drumming is nowhere near Kris Kontos even though Dave McClain is suitable enough to do the job properly. In fact again, the spotlight really goes to guitarist Logan Mader and Adam Duce who even go so far to help Robb Flynn in tweaking the sound on \"Burn My Eyes\" where if anything, it lets Robb Flynn not feel so strained and held-back in the vocal delivery department. Robb Flynn himself actually sounds legit as fuck even with his more melodic singing which felt like he was trying so hard before now he feels more comfortable and less squeaky. Overall whatever the band and Robb was doing and considering the so-called stress and pressure the band was under, and the year came out and the two albums that surround it......it's very enjoyable. Robb Flynn again being the one to whine and complain about album sales, but fuck out of here with that bullshit dude! If anything the dissapointment and 'stress' you dealt with helped create one of your better albums outside of Vio-lence. Doofus.\n\nThis album also deserves the track-by-track review because in comparison to it's debut brother, there's a lot more going on in the 10 songs and some thing worth-noted.\n\n1). Ten Ton Hammer - The first single off the album. Don't expect \"Davidian\" because this is a mid-tempo groove that has those guitar squeals that Robb is known to overuse when he wants. One thing that stands out is the heavily downtuned sound and \"nu\" feel to this song. Regardless of how one may feel, compared to the next song, this band is tame and ranks up there as one of Machine Head's best songs. Robb Flynn also more or less uses the same baritone/melodic singing during the chorus as he does on \"Old\", but here he sounds way more relaxed. This song also sets the tone for the rest of the album as far as mood goes. It's not the agrro-show-me-sum-fukkin-respect-worship of \"Burn My Eyes.\" If anything it's waaaaaay more brooding. The interesting thing about this song is that it uses the same two guitar riff effect as found in \"Deathchurch\" on \"Burn My Eyes.\" Less Godflesh influence and more Alternative Metal-driven. \n\n2). Take My Scars - Ew. That's all I have to say. You thought the song \"A Thousand Lies\" was an early example of jumpdafuckup riffs and wiggerish hand movements? Well they take it to a whole new level with this one. That annoying ding-ding-ding-ding intro will keep you at bay if you let it. The rest of the song more stays in this weird area of mixing Groove Metal/Nu-metal in bridging the two. But then right at the last second when you think you've heard everything comes the \"Open up your mind\" part which, lol, just watch the music video to this on Youtube. You'll see what I mean.\n\n3). Struck A Nerve - This is the first song where we see Machine Head playing faster and it gets to the pace of a NYHC song (Think of the band Sick Of It All) and again combining it with a groovy breakdown. For the most part it's not bad until you here the \"Com'n, Com'n, Com'n\" part. Overall the song isn't as bad as \"Take My Scars\"....but the ending part just dampers the effect it originally had going for it. \n\n4). Down To None - This is the first series in a songs that take all the characteristics found during the 2nd act of \"Burn My Eyes\" and enhances everything to where you see at their best. The creepy intro melody that crawls by at a snails pace builds into a really heavy Sabbath-influenced doomy riff that turns into a fine example of how to do groove metal properly. When I revisited this album alongside \"Burn My Eyes\", I also felt this overall weird Neurosis vibe to TMTC. \n\n5). The Frontlines - This song was written in the touring time period between \"Burn My Eyes\" and \"The More Things Change\" and was played before the recording of TMTC. This song right here shows the pain-staking means and necessary progress that Robb and the rest in Machine Head would have to make in order to sound like they do here. For a groove metal song, it's a very unorthodox one. The tempo changes and everything really shine through in that you really don't know what to expect. \n\n6). Spine - If Machine Head ever wanted to be considered more of an alternative metal band than a groove metal, this would be their best example. This song, at least the main riff, sounds very identical to the rhythm and tempo of the song \"Shame\" by the 90's industrial rock band Stabbing Westward. In fact this song as far as the pace and sheer catchiness is concerned it would have made a better 2nd single than \"Take My Scars.\" For a song that is so Alternative Metal-driven, the most shocking thing about it is the build-up to the Sabbath/classic-sounding guitar solo at the end which makes you wonder how they could take a song that could easily qualify as a jumpdafuckup mosh fest and turn it into an unspoken groove metal classic or even a song that resembles a legit-as-shit overall classic metal feel. Fuck \"Davidian\".....this alongside \"Ten Ton Hammer\" off TMTC best represents at what Machine Head IS capable of. Also Adam Duce's bass-driven stomp in this riff fest is his shining moment. My personal favorite song off this album. \n\n7). Bay of Pigs - The bigger and better version of \"Struck A Nerve\" for the most part. Not much to say other than that.\n\n8). Violate - The most brooding song on the entire album. As if the overall atmosphere on TMTC wasn't already catching on enough, here is where Robb Flynn literally shines the fuck right through with his vocal delivery as far as melodic singing goes. Again another song that the main emphasis is the build-up but when the groove riff hits it's really well-done. If Robb ever wanted to let any sort of anger speak for itself, it's this song.\n\n9). Blistering - Dave McClaine's drumming really shines through on this song. Another faster tempo song in the style of \"Bay of Pigs,\" and \"Take My Scars.\" \n\n10). Blood Of The Zodiac - The epic ending track to an overlooked atmospheric and challenging groove metal album. And sums up everything great about this album. Logan Mader's guitarwork on this track is the highlight. The entire album is worth listening to just to get to this particular track. It's a treat. \n\nNow that we have more or less properly dissected TMTC, can we now look at how many moments that so many claim to be those dreaded so-called \"Nu Metal\" moments? 2. That is it. Even if you feel at times it starts to girate a bit to the nu side, again you're going to feel a bit surprised or shocked at how it really deflects it and again puts more emphasis on groove, mood, atmosphere, song dynamics, etc.etc. There's so much more going on that it seems rather insulting and cheap to dismiss it as an that supposedly 'bridged' the half-thrash sound of \"Burn My Eyes\" and the Nu-Metal abomination of \"The Burning Red.\" Actjually that title goes to Robb Flynn's most recent piece of shit \"Catharsis\".....good lord Robb.\n\nIt's sad really because this is where I stop. For now. May be in the future I will look over albums such as \"Unto the Locust\" or \"Bloodstone & Diamonds\" but truth be told I feel that I will be listening to a boneless Arch Enemy or even worse....a boneless Trivium that is basically a boneless Machine Head. At least for one album, Robb Flynn dropped the macho bullshit and let himself actually make something authentic. It's not forced and he's not trying to pander to whatever crowd is 'in' at the moment nor is he fucking butthurt about whatever beef he has with other musicians. \"The More Things Change...\" is an album that I can legit listen to over and over again. I wouldn't call it a classic, nor would I rank it in my top favorite albums, but it's a snapshot of what could have been: a confident Robb Flynn and an authentic one at that. An actual artist who would have and could have taken groove metal outside of it's own proverbial angsty box and at the end of the day....a Robb Flynn I could take seriously.\n",
        "\nMachine Head is a band I've always had a hard time being a fan of. They have jumped on different trends throughout their entire career and it's hard to give them any them credit for being original, even if some of their early albums were cool. After having put out two horrible nu-metal albums in 1999 and 2001 respectively, the band released their redemption album Through The Ashes Of Empires in 2003. The sound of that album was a mix between their early groove metal sound and the typical metalcore style of that era. The result was pretty decent but still not quite at the band's full potential. That potential would be reached in 2007, when the band unleased their widely acclaimed magnum opus known as The Blackening.\n\nThe album opens with \"Clenching The Fists Of Dissent\", an epic piece clocking in at close to eleven minutes. Similar to the preceding album's opener \"Imperium\", the song has a lengthy intro with acoustic guitars building up towards the more grandeur opening; a blistering thrash riff that sets the style for the remainder of the album. The entire song is constantly building itself and passes through a variety of stages, much like a movie. It's all very well-executed. After this grand opening is over, the band takes a more traditional route with a bunch of shorter songs. \"Beautiful Mourning\" is more of a radio song and has Robb Flynn doing some pretty whiny vocals at times. It's possibly the weakest track on the album but still a good one. \"Aesthetics Of Hate\" and \"Slanderous\" are aggressive thrashers with some really engaging guitar work. The last three tracks all clock in at over nine minutes, with \"Halo\" being a heavy yet radio-friendly epic while \"Wolves\" is more of a progressive thrasher. \"A Farewell To Arms\" closes the album perfectly with its mellow passages and hardcore-esque climax.\n\nThe production values of this album are mostly great. The guitars sound very crisp and crunchy while the drums utilize some organic sounds instead of all triggers. This adds more life to the instrumentation which feels a lot less artificial compared to many albums from the band's contemporaries. The mastering, however, is about as bad as can be. Anyone familiar with the loudness wars will know what I'm talking about. The audio is clipping very badly throughout most of the songs and it's especially evident during the latter half of the album. The guitar solos are mostly affected by this, which is a damn shame considering how good some of them are. The bonus disc with old B-sides that comes with my version has the same problem. Most of the songs basically sound like they're being sonically raped.\n\nThe Blackening is a very strong effort from Machine Head if seen from a musical perspective. I suppose most of the lyrics here are superior to what they (Robb) are writing nowadays as well, seeing as the lyrics are not nearly as cringe-worthy here. The band sounds great and is at a career peak musically, with a production that is nearly flawless except for the horrible mastering job. I do, however, own a promo version of this album that sounds a lot better than my (listed) retail copy. My retail version has a dynamic range of 6 while my promo is at 8. It still clips at a few occasions, but it's a lot less evident than on any retail copy you'll find. I can totally recommend you to track down a promo copy on Discogs or something for the optimal sound quality. You could also try to get your hands on a vinyl pressing, but they're quite pricey from what I've seen around the web.\n\nIf you like modern metal with thrashy riffs and solos, mixed vocal styles and the occassional hardcore-type riffing, then you should be in for a treat with this one. It's about as good as modern metal gets.\n\nCheck-outs: \"Clenching The Fists Of Dissent\", \"Aesthetics Of Hate\", \"Slanderous\", \"Halo\".\n",
        "\nThe old adage of separating the art from the artist seems a tired cliche in need of retirement at times, especially when dealing with those creative individuals who love controversy like a spider monkey on Viagra does the first thing it can mount. Nevertheless, it is a fairly good rule to follow, in spite of how rarely it is followed consistently by most, as a lot of pretentious men have crafted some works that are at least worthy of their egos. In keeping with this, all of the peripheral issues surrounding the likes of Robb Flynn, from his ongoing feud with arguably his only metallic muse Phil Anselmo (KoRn and Limp Bizkit naturally don't qualify) to his lesser known tit for tat with former Machine Head bassist Adam Duce (who can't seem to get a life and is the only musician associated with the band to have not produced anything else in the metal style), are not under consideration regarding the sad, sordid, sonic mess of slop that is this band's ninth LP Catharsis.\n\nNothing says \"I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks, I'm gonna be me\" like pissing away the redemptive stylistic evolution that was going on for the past 10 years and revisiting the nu-metal craze of the late 90s that most of your fans utterly hate. Unfortunately for Flynn and company, good music doesn't necessarily follow when one bucks a trend, and this album not sounding like most of what is going on these days in metal is the only thing it has going for it. There is scarcely a trace of thrash metal riffing to be found on this bloated, overlong collection of misses and even wider misses, save a few trace smatterings here and there, usually giving way to awkward \"melodic\" sections that muffle whatever thunder has been achieved. Truth be told, about the only thing that was really held over from the admirably decent fury of Unto The Locust and Bloodstone & Diamonds is some fairly fancy guitar soloing courtesy of Phil Demmel, though it serves little purpose other than pouring sugar onto a massive excrement sandwich.\n\nThe first impression that this album gives, even when at its most ludicrous, is one of professionalism given the mixing job this thing received is about as polished and modern as they come. Its a double-edged sword though, as the clarity and balance given to Flynn's clean vocal work makes him come off as a gelded pop vocalist, particularly on the heavily orchestrated nu-metal meets pop/rock romp and title song \"Catharsis\", one of the most bizarrely grotesque yet flawlessly presented abominations to role out of Machine Head's rectum. The cringe factor does increase even further with the rapping/slam poetry meets Limp Bizkit rot of \"Triple Beam\", while the hypnotic acoustic droning of \"Behind A Mask\" and the pop-infused attempt at aping John Mellencamp with the occasional metal twist in \"Bastards\" kicks it into full overdrive, causing one to cease in asking what these guys were thinking and start asking what kind of phallus screwed their brains into oatmeal.\n\nThere are a handful of attempts at metallic bluster that fall far short in totality, yet outshine the rest all the same. The opening semi-cruiser \"Volatile\" is peppered with some really lousy shouted vocals out of Flynn that are way too reminiscent of Jonathan Davis, but it manages to cook for the majority of its duration at an upper mid-pace and features a moderately animated set of down-tuned groove riffs. \"California Bleeding\" takes a similarly up tempo approach to lesser success as the vocals are even more gimpy and nu-metal infused, and they go a bit too heavy on the guitar squeals. On the groovier side of things is \"Screaming At The Sun\", which shifts between being an Alice In Chains emulation with thinner clean vocal harmonies that sound less menacing and more childish, but the guitar work and grinding heaviness of the rhythm section does manage to grab the ears every now and again. None of these songs really come off as solid, but rather schizophrenic with some traces of effective craziness, and apart from the somewhat more consistent thrasher \"Razorblade Smile\" (which still comes with the cringe-infused vocal baggage), stand as the least terrible of what is a horrendous retread of a past best forgotten.\n\nIf there is any objective way to sum up precisely what this album is, it could be seen as a missing link between the almost nu-metal leaning The More Things Change... and the overt nu-metal rubbish of The Burning Red, but packaged in a way conducive to the sonic character of their most recent work. It sits pretty snugly between both albums in terms of overall quality, being more guitar oriented and technical than the early exploits of KoRn and Limp Bizkit, but almost equally as unbearable to the metal-obsessed ear. Though it's a foregone conclusion that Flynn himself will attest to this musical abortion as being a grand statement regarding current events, but lyrics aside, the more obvious answer is a baffling attempt to cash out by combining said subject matter with a musical fad that would be best left in the septic tank of history. Given the initial sales of this barely managed to hit the halfway mark of what Bloodstone & Diamonds managed to move, it'll likely be remembered as one of the dumbest stylistic pivots in metal history.\n",
        "\nI should probably put in a disclaimer that I have never liked Machine Head. I remember the hype that surrounded The Blackening when I was in high school and not understanding what the fuss was about despite my best efforts. Listening to their other albums has also failed to endear me to them, as even staples like Burn My Eyes and Through the Ashes of Empires are just average to my ears. That said, I suppose I should be thankful for Machine Head; there are few others that so efficiently illustrate the different degrees of how much a band can suck.\n\nIt\u2019s also rare for a band to make an album this simultaneously eclectic and shallow. As tempting as it is to think of Catharsis as a Burning Red/Supercharger throwback, there\u2019s thankfully a bit more going on than that stylistically. There are plenty of rap metal moments on the horrid \u201cTriple Beam\u201d and \u201cPsychotic\u201d among others, but you\u2019ll also find elements of the thrash-tinged groovecore riffing associated with the band\u2019s comeback era on \u201cHeavy Lies the Crown,\u201d while \u201cBehind a Mask\u201d and \u201cEulogy\u201d provide more melodic odds and ends.\n\nUnfortunately, the band lacks both the songwriting skill and confidence to make any of these ideas work. I\u2019ll admit that the singles are easy to get in one\u2019s head, but even on the slim chance that you\u2019d like what these tracks are going for, the lazy structures make them hard sells. This is best demonstrated by \u201cBastards,\u201d the album\u2019s controversial centerpiece. Even if you\u2019re one of the few people who intrigued by the idea of Machine Head pulling out a folk punk anthem, the execution is far too plodding for what should be a bouncy, defiant call to arms. The fact that there are fifteen songs on here just adds insult to injury.\n\nEven sadder is the fact that the musicianship is still incredibly tight. The production puts all the instruments in perfect balance; the guitars, bass, and drums shine throughout and even the most awful songs are sustained by powerful tones and a good grip on tempo shifts. The musicians clearly put a lot of effort in making sure these structures were at least well-maintained, which only highlights how horrible the original blueprints are. I can only imagine how it must\u2019ve felt to lay down such intricate patterns just to see them lose all credibility as soon as their fearless leader stepped up to the mic\u2026\n\nAs everyone has already pointed out, the worst of Catharsis lies in guitarist/vocalist Robb Flynn\u2019s vocals and lyrics. But here\u2019s the thing: his vocals and lyrics have always been the worst thing about Machine Head. His yells are toothless, his cleans are ungodly whiny, and his raps are cringeworthy, but they\u2019ve been that way for nearly twenty-five years now. I suppose his flaws are accentuated by lyrics, which I find obnoxious even though I\u2019m one of the SJW libtards he\u2019s pandering to, but it really shouldn\u2019t be that surprising. It also doesn\u2019t help that he frequently contradicts his political attitudes with tales of drug abuse, violence, and other frat bro-isms.\n\nMuch like the alt-right surge that got Trump elected, Catharsis is merely the exposure of a seedy underbelly that\u2019s always been there. As much as the excellent musicianship tries to save these wretched tunes, the album is a seventy-minute distillation of everything that has been wrong with Machine Head from their inception. It doesn\u2019t share Supercharger\u2019s rock bottom position, but any good intentions are marred by poor writing and worse deliveries. If the band survives this, they\u2019ll likely end up back in good graces once they find a new trend to hop on. I will remain unconvinced. I admire what you told your sons, Mr. Flynn, but the bastards are still grinding you down and this is the soundtrack.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cBehind A Mask\u201d\n\u201cHeavy Lies the Crown\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n",
        "\nIt was hard not to notice the absolutely terrible reception this album received from the outset. In fact, the backlash was so fervent and unanimously shared that it all made me a little skeptical. I just didn't think it was possible that a proven heavyweight like Machine Head could release such an unmitigated stinker at this point in their career.\n\nSo, for better or worse, I listened to it with an open, receptive attitude. Actively ready to highlight the things I liked about the record, rather than just immediately jumping aboard the slate train that has thus far absolutely destroyed this album. And the result is... I do not particularly like it.\n\nAnd it's not the \"anger\" that so many people cite. After all, hearing Robb Flynn scream \"fuck the world\" to open the record really didn't feel so different from hearing him scream \"fuck you all\" at the start of track two of The Blackening, an album people incessantly whacked off over when it was released. Even with Aesthetics of Hate, as much as I agreed with the sentiment, I felt as though Robb was giving the target of the song too much acknowledgement. But that is who Robb Flynn is: he is an angry, honest dude. Even if it seems a little irrational at times. It's not something anyone can hold against him by now, as it's really fostered some great music over the years.\n\nBut it isn't really the anger that puts the listener off. It's the frontal assault of daft machismo. It's served up abundance here, but perhaps the worst examples are California Bleeding and Triple Beam. I actually really like the sentiment behind Triple Beam; for a socially conscious guy like Robb Flynn, a rugged anti-drug anthem is something we really should expect and as a concept it has quite a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the song itself is a sadly ham-fisted offering, completely lacking in nuance, that culminates in a knife fight between rival gangs told by way of drab, simplistic raps that could have been written by the Beastie Boys in 1989.\n\nAnd California Bleeding just seems to be a first person account of a day in the life of a complete asshole. I don't know if it's meant to come off as gritty and confronting, but it seems to do nothing more than wallow in the protagonist's morally devoid behaviors for the sake of it. \n\nAnother notable misstep is Bastards. I recall reading something about a Dropkick Murphy's shout-out in regards to this album, which could have only been referring to this song, although with its repetitive and spirited strumming of a major chord progression it more reminds me of something Mumford and Sons might cough up. \n\nSo yes, most of aspects of this record that stand out do so for the wrong reasons. But, if I scored this album too low it would imply that it has absolutely no redeeming/appealing qualities whatsoever. This is not the case.\n\nBehind a Mask is a decent ballad that actually succeeds in coming across as a sincere study of human regret. And Heavy Lies the Crown opens with a striking orchestral synth arrangement that slowly builds in mood and intensity, the first two verses delivered in a foreboding rasp. The lyrics paint a dark, ominous picture of the \"Spider King\" (Louis XI of France, apparently. Thanks, google), known as such due to his use of manipulation and deception as his stepping-stones to power.\n\nNot only is the subject matter of this one properly interesting, but Robb and co actually demonstrate quite a bit of welcome restraint here, as they allow the song to build up towards its heavy, frenetic climax, before ending as it begun, on a quiet note. It clocks in at 9 minutes but it does not feel bloated or overlong. The buildup feels organic, and while Robb Flynn's rage shows up as sure as dandelions in springtime, it actually comes across as channeled and fierce as opposed to cheesy and forced. It is an absolute belter of a tune.\n\nGiven that these two come consecutively, you might be forgiven for getting your hopes up and thinking that Catharsis is on its way to a good, strong finish. Unfortunately, the song that follows, Psychotic, is everything the critics and pundits panned it for; as banal a nu-metal tune as you'll ever hear, complete with uninspired lyrics and a vocal delivery that tries way too hard to sound \"demented\". \n\nThroughout the rest of the album expect to find a somewhat sparse smattering of genuinely catchy, head-knocking riffs, some political chest beating, a few silly pornographic lyrics and the odd poignant moment. Just don't expect it to be arranged in a way that sustains your interest. I'm not convinced that Machine Head have released the unmitigated stinker that everyone is saying it is, but it is by no means a strong album, especially compared to what we know they're capable of. That's why, at least as I see it, the criticism of this album is so dire. We all know they can do a lot better.\n",
        "\nMachine Head is one of those bands I have followed throughout its ups and downs and it's never been a rock-steady relationship between me as a fan and them as a band. I became a fan around the time when The Blackening was happening and everybody was going apeshit over how good it was. From that point on I have been a faithful follower of their music ever since, even though I probably prefered the early stuff like Burn My Eyes from day one. The one thing about Machine Head that bothered me was their nu-metal phase (which I mostly despise) and even though this was long gone by the time I got into them, I couldn't help but feel like they were slowly going back towards that sound and style with every consecutive release post-2007. I explained this in greater detail in my reviews for Unto The Locust and Bloodstone & Diamonds respectively.\n\nSo where is Machine Head at now with Catharsis? Before I get to my personal opinion on this, I'd like to take a quick trip back to 2016 when the band released their controversial stand-alone single; Is Anybody Out There?. As most of you probably know by now, that single was aimed at the actions made by Phil Anselmo (a drunken nazi salute at some concert). Robb Flynn was at said concert and allegedly saw Anselmo's distasteful gesture in person. Instead of going face-to-face with Anselmo and berate him on the spot, Flynn instead opted to go home and aim this particular song indirectly towards Anselmo and the incident. So, to answer you on where Machine Head is at now, the answer is rather simple: at war with nazism and seemingly everything closely affiliated with it. That includes right-wing political sympathsizers (notably rednecks and the likes of it) as well as the current president of the USA; Donald Trump.\n\nNow, I'm not the kind of person who judges a person by differing opinions towards my own, no less what you think of a president that isn't mine either. I've seen people starting to call out Machine Head for being \"libtards\" and whatever else but in all honesty, is anyone surprised by Flynn's political stance as of late? The guy was in a Bay-Area thrash band, a genre notorious for its left-wing ideologies. That's not a problem if you ask me, seeing as we all have opinions and rights to voice them. The only problem about Flynn's political stance is how he expresses it, which also happens to be this album's great flaw and ultimate dealbreaker, namely the lyrical content.\n\nMany of us still remember the early-to-mid 2000's as being ruled by shitty, whiney and crying nu-metal and emo bands. At least I do. I'd like to think it all died out for obvious reasons but listening to Catharsis, I suddenly feel thrown back to 2002. The lyrics all over this record are the worst I have heard in a long time. I never thought a 50-year-old experienced man could be so convincing at seemingly being 15 again, but Flynn does a really good job at it. The lyrics are just filled with an overkilled dose of vulgarity which I suppose is to make the songs \"really pissed off and a bit edgy\". When putting on the record and the first thing you hear Flynn yell out is \"fuck the world!\", you can only start to brace yourself for the impending cringefest that lies ahead. Unfortunately, it carries on throughout the entire album. One way or another, whether it's the teen-angsty vulgarity or not, the lyrics leave you cringing at some point in basically every song. Flynn's ways of messaging the listeners just fall plain flat and it's extremely hard to take anything he says seriously. The worst example is probably found in the song \"Razorblade Smile\", where Flynn literally busts out the line \"I'm eating pussy by a dumpster\". That more or less sums of the lyrical quality of the entire album right there.\n\nMusically speaking Catharsis isn't much of a high point for the band either. It's mostly a very bland and schizophrenic collection of tunes where most of them just sound uninspired or forced. When listening to this album you can tell that the music was put in second place in favor of the lyrical content, which is a damn shame considering how horrid the lyrical content is. Very few songs feel connected and as being part of the same album. This doesn't necessarily have to be a bad trait if it's done in a smart way (Faith No More for instance), but as you can probably guess by now, such is not the case here. Most of the songs are either groovy like you'd expect or back to the band's old down-tuned nu-metal sound, much to my personal distaste. Some of the groovy songs do show some promise, however, but always fall flat when the shitty lyrics and/or Flynn's cringe-worthy rapping kicks in. A few tracks take a different route where \"Bastards\", for instance, is a Machine Head-esque take on a folk song. It's a bold move but I can't say that it works very well. \"Grind You Down\" is another example, and possibly also the worst, of how the band literally grinds several styles (nu-metal, growl and emo-whining) down into a musical mess. What little of worth there is to be found on Catharsis is basically butchered by other things.\n\nDespite how I've felt towards the past two albums and the band seemingly going downhill musically, Catharsis has taken the band to an unimaginable low level since the last record. I didn't exactly have any higher hopes but I at least expected Machine Head to embrace the negative feedback they got on Is There Anybody Out There?, which ultimately proved to be a foreshadowing of this album's style and direction. On the other hand I applaude them for defying that bad reception and go their own way, even if it seems somewhat trend-hopping yet once again. After all, few bands have been as successful at jumping trends as Machine Head has. With this in mind, however, I know that many fans including myself aren't exactly happy about this. It's sad that a band of the musical capabilities that Machine Head possesses is wasting an opportunity by putting out such a half-assed effort, which basically serves no other purpose than to (unsuccessfully) fuel a cringeful manifest of bad lyrics. Especially considering how overambitious this album is with its 15 tracks and 75 minute run time. I believe they could've pulled this off so much better than they did, but it is what it is.\n\nAs I conclude this review only one question remains: has Machine Head finally committed a more imminent and unforgivable career suicide this time around? I for one know that I'm gonna have a hard time ever anticipating any new material from these guys ever again.\n",
        "\nOkay, this thing just makes me sad. After all of the building Machine Head has done over the past decade and a half, they decide to smash most of that down with an album nobody was asking for. This is a mixture of the big, semi-orchestral sounds of Unto the Locust and Bloodstone and Diamonds mashed together with the horrific and awkward nu metal of The Burning Red and Supercharger. Catharsis tries to hold onto the past grand sound but also, mix in the style of some of their simplest and most unfortunate material ever devised which just feels wrong. After hearing the preceding single \"Is There Anybody Out There\" I got a bad feeling that Robb Flynn and company would be returning to the dreaded style of hybrid rap metal that ruined their credibility once in the past. I guess if anything, this is a sign that these guys probably aren't aware of how actively repellent the music they're making actually is.\n\nThe story behind the politics and style of this music is an interesting one. Anybody remember Dimebash 2016? When Phil Anselmo shouted a racist slogan and threw a Hitler salute? Robb Flynn took that as a betrayal and has apparently been moving back to nu metal as a way of sticking it to his former friend's racist views. I can only imagine the sudden rise of the radical right in the years leading up to this has only made him even more freaked out and as such, the album contains a lot of heavy handed politics as a reaction to the reactionaries. Now, protest music against corrupt conservatives is something that I welcome, but there is a difference between being \"in your face\" and just sounding preachy, and this is incredibly preachy. He talks about how many evil people and racists there are, but sounds scared and sensitive rather than in a raging resistance mood. Machine Head made fiery protest music in the past on The Blackening and Burn My Eyes. The music on those albums had so much more confidence and fury behind them without resorting to corny rap verses and sappy ballads. This ties into the music which is definitely a step down from before.\n\nWhile this doesn't get to Supercharger levels of simplicity, the music on hold definitely suffers from Flynn's weaknesses being laid bare. His vocals are the biggest problem on here with a lot of his shouting sounding strained like he gave one take, got tired, and said \"that's good enough\". He sounds so weak to the point that he even occasionally returns to the cry-singing that plagued Supercharger. It never gets to that album's particularly piercing levels of excessive annoyance, but it's unwelcome, unnecessary, and just plain grating, as is his goofy-ass rapping. Probably the only thing saving this album is that there is a tiny bit of that Locust-level richness to the guitar-play and composition even if it is dumbed down. It feels like a severe regression and that is never good.\n\nThere are a few decent riffs on \"Catharsis\" and \"Heavy Lies the Crown\" but even those get sullied due to clean vocals that sound too clean and melodic to the point of sounding poppy. The guitar play hasn't totally regressed, but it is certainly a much simpler beast than before. The songs either feel like they're trying too hard to be catchy and hook-laden, or just end up weird and disjointed. This album also goes in a bunch of weird directions with the groove metal being less pounding, some songs are full on nu metal with Flynn telling you to \"GET YOUR MIDDLE FINGERS IN THE AIR\" and playing nothing but jump-up chords on \"Triple Beam\", There's also the acoustic element of the music that just feels embarrassing and features some of the most sensitive lyrics on here. He talks about how \"There is love, our words can stop their guns\" on the sappy Irish-folk-tinged ballad \"Bastards\" which easily ranks as the worst song on the album with how he cries his eyes out about the radical right. I hate the everything the radical right stands for, and it infuriates me to see them empowered by a weak opposition like this. The Burn My Eyes-era Robb Flynn wouldn't talk about how love can stop guns. He'd threaten to turn their guns on them and fuck them up, He'd expose their evil deeds instead of talking about how they just happen to be dicks. What happened to you man? Where is your courage? Your gusto? it all seems to be gone, or at least weakened severely.\n\nThere's also some quirks on this album that just feel obnoxious and out-of-place. The base music varies from blase Locust D-cuts to wack out-of-date nu metal that's as simple and immature as possible, and the quirks are also similarly varied. They range from stupid Supremes-style background vocals on \"California Bleeding\", to some death metal guy belching out part of the chorus to \"Grind You Down\" with no warning only to be followed by some poppy melodic chorus. The song \"Eulogy\" is basically just \"Bastards\" re-done in a darker style. Did you really have to put the wimpiest song on the album twice? Are you guys really that proud of that song? Like I said before, I like protest music, but this is too damn soft and sensitive with vocals that sound whiny. This is not rousing, heroic, or rebellious, it just feels like your weeping and defeated. Where is the fire? It's strange turns like this that take this album from simply bad, to infuriating.\n\nSeeing a band I used to like so much do this, just feels painful. Catharsis is anything but cathartic. It feels like witnessing somebody throw their life away over a vendetta that's just not worth it. I get that the world is full of problems and maybe there needs to be someone to shout about them in rhythm, but Machine Head are just not doing that well at all. These juvenile lyrics, jangly songs, wimpy outpourings of emotion, and vast regression and simplification of their sound are just painful to listen to and Catharsis is not something I ever plan on listening to again. This thing is completely and utterly useless with some of the most obnoxious songs ever released by this band. I cannot fathom how this was a good idea in the head of anyone involved, even Robb Flynn who's let his ego and his \"mission\" get in the way of him making crushing metal that isn't whingy and awkward. If it's any consolation, \"Behind The Mask\" is actually decent for an emotional acoustic ballad, but we came here for metal and all of that is marred by strained vocals, preachy lyrics, and the regressive return of nu metal. I still think Supercharger is worse than this due to a bit of leftover pomp from Locust elevating this a bit, but only slightly. In just about any musical sense, this is still worthless. Machine Head, guys? never do this again.\n",
        "\nSeems as if the pieces were in place for this album to be hated; a band stamped in the rise of the groove metal scene, a \"controversial\" genre reaching it's mainstream exposure in 1999 and signs of Machine Head starting to drift towards the sound on their last album \"The More Things Change...\". So is this album worth the controversy? .....no honestly.\n\nProduction wise this album still has the heavy distortion but this time with an extra \"OOMPH!\" courtesy of legendary Ross Robinson; \"The Godfather of nu metal\". His production style adds more emphasis on the down-end of a beat, which in return adds more punch to Dave McClain's kick drum, and it really makes this album extra headbang-worthy.\n\nThen there's Robb Flynn, as metal vocalists go he's average but still impressive as he shreds his throat across the album's twelve tracks, but his clean vocals could use some work. They've definitely gotten better with future albums but here unfortunately with his mid to high range tone, can sound quite whiny, as \"Five\" and The Police cover \"Message in a Bottle\" prove to be, and can be quite a jog to get through.\n\nNow the album hasn't completely succumbed to the \"jumpdafuckup self-hatred\" lyrics found in some nu-metal; tracks like \"Devil With the King's Card\", about the titular man himself convincing out protagonist to join the dark side and braggadocious tracks like \"The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears\" and \"Desire to Fire\". But definitely a highlight on the album is the song \"Five\", which is this album's \"Daddy\" (referencing the infamous Korn track\") right down to the breaking down and sobbing at the end of the track; as this is about Robb when he was molested at the titular age, quite reasonable to see why he doesn't perform this live, and don't be surprised if you're left feeling uneasy after this listen.\n\nOverall this album shows how big Machine Head's range can be, fully submerging themselves in the nu-metal sound they pull off surprisingly well while having only merely dipped their toes in it. This album didn't kill their career as many elitist metalheads just weren't ready for a change, plus seeing how it is their best selling should be a sign how much the public loved this nu-metal sound. Give it a listen if you ever come across it.\n",
        "\n1999's The Burning Red was a money-driven aping of the nu/rap metal craze which has been critically panned here and elsewhere, yet in recent years it has garnered somewhat of a 'cult' following so to speak. The 2001 Johnny K-produced follow up Supercharger on the other hand has not, which is mystifying since It clearly was nu metal being done less ineptly.\n\nWhereas The Burning Red took all the worst elements of nu metal (watered down Pantera aesthetic, a complete disregard for melodies, homogeneous grunge riffing), this takes some of the genre's better traits, such as sing a long hard rock ballads (\"Crashing Around You\", \"Deafening Silence\") and danceable, somewhat unpredictable groove-oriented jams (\"Kick You When Your Down\", Ten Fold\", \"Nausea\").\n\nThe aforementioned \"Deafening Silence\" in fact has an emotional weight to it that one might not associate with bands from this particular style of music. There are also other sad and atmospheric slow-burner songs, such as \"Only the Names\" and \"Blank Generation\", although aesthetically they have too much in common with Tool to be considered straight up ballad type songs.\n\nLyrically, many have argued that this is even worse than The Burning Red, due to having a more juvenile slant. While this might be true to some extent, I will still always find songs like \"American High\" (which details Robb Flynn's chaotic teen years) far more interesting than the nonsensical tough guy ranting of \"Devil with the King's Card\" and so on.\n\nClearly this was not created to please thrash fans. Many rightfully so even see it as Machine Head spitting right in their faces. But still, if you enjoy groove-focused nu metal with a melodic hard rock influence \u2014 ie Mudvayne, No One, Nothingface, Skrape and \u00dcnloco \u2014 then this can still be an enjoyable listen, no matter what detractors of the style might say.\n",
        "\nOf every album in Machine Head's catalogue this is the most forgotten, and with good reason. The band manages to write some of their most confused and unfocused material for this album, and as a result this is their least consistent and most uneven work. On top of that, given the band in question it's naturally a grating, 4th tier exercise in amplifying the worst aspects of whatever sound they're playing this time round - in this case the band stopped being an imitator of Pantera with a penchant for half-ballads and down-tuning and instead started moving towards playing nu-metal.\n\nIn truth the sound on this album isn't really nu-metal, but the alternative rock influences present on Burn My Eyes are now consistently pushed to the forefront of the music. The grooves are simpler and muddier than before, and there is an increased reliance on two note drones and more percussive chugging. None of the riffs or guitar lines on this album are really memorable or interesting - at no point are any real hard-hitting, massive grooves or any kind of thrash-influenced riffing attempted at all and any grooves on the album amount to nothing more than rejected Chaos A.D. material. There is some usage of the alternative rock chord strum for more melodic material, particularly when clean vocals are used. Another feature of the music is the heavy usage of guitar squeals, which are supposed to create a tense atmosphere of sorts but simply grate on the ears and make songs like 'Ten Ton Hammer' truly painful to listen to. This mish-mash of techniques and confused sound makes for an uneven listen, because it's never clear what the band is going for in any one song - are they trying to be percussive or atmospheric? Melodic or atonal? Driving or droning? It's very confused music that has no clear objective or focus.\n\nFrom the guitar tone lacking the same bite it had on Burn My Eyes to the the reduced presence of the riffs in favour of guitar noise, the bass or silence, the band are obviously trying to make their music more atmospheric in a nu-metal sort of way, and then marry that to their heavier groove metal sound but it falls very flat, as the way the band go about it here makes for a dreadful compromise. They haven't fully taken the plunge into nu-metal territory so the music is more guitar driven than you'd expect; the guitar tone is more percussive and has more impact than most nu-metal and yet the reduced presence of the riffs means the guitarists play very static, uninteresting material. As a result of this the band spends most of any given song trying to be heavy and aggressive but not having the riffs to do so, resulting in a lot of the album being very bland. Because the guitars are the focus of the music, any time they drop out of the music it completely breaks the flow of the song and any time they start squealing it becomes unbearable because the noise is too loud. This is the result of the indecisiveness on the band's part; a set of musically confused songs that fail at everything they attempt to do. \n\nComplicating matters further is Robb's vocal performance, which serves to completely ruin any semi-decent moments the band might stumble into once in a while. His hardcore influenced shout lacks punch and impact much like the music behind him, and as a result he doesn't actually sound all that aggressive. This further robs any power from the album's heavier moments as he doesn't have the commanding, powerful voice needed for this kind of music; contrast this performance with Phil Anselmo on Far Beyond Driven and decide who does the better job of being aggressive. His clean vocals are even worse - used during the quiet and melodic moments of the music, they are particularly whiny and weak and ruin the mood. It doesn't help that they are far more exposed than the shouting, so they are the only focus of the music. His distorted whispering to the sound of guitar squealing is perhaps the worst though, as at these points the music stops being grating and actually becomes painful to listen to.\n\nThe songwriting makes matters even worse, as the band see fit to try and be 'progressive'. While they don't hover around the 7-10 minute mark for the entire album like they would later on, every song on the album is still too long and contains only a handful of ideas, each largely unrelated to one another. They tend to dwell on a given idea for most of the song while sticking to verse-hook structures with poorly placed 'atmospheric' sections and other assorted nonsense for good measure. None of the songs really flow, rather every track feels like a grab bag of assorted ideas as the band meander from one hook to the next. None of the songs are terribly catchy despite their attempts at accessible hooks, mostly due to bad singing and lacklustre vocal lines.\n\nThere's no real reason to listen to this album. Everything the band tries to do falls flat due to numerous deficiencies in performance, production and songwriting, every song manages to be grating and boring, nothing really sticks out for a positive reason and the whole thing just lacks focus. It's a mess, one which makes The Blackening look positively cohesive and properly written.\n",
        "\nI am not really a fan of Robb Flynn's Machine Head band. Even from the very instant that I heard their groove-laden thrash metal debut, I already knew that these guys don't have anything unique to offer to the metal scene. And I'm not just saying this because I don't like that musical class. Frankly speaking, I myself have numerous favorites who play in the genre. It is just unfortunate that Machine Head did not have that potential to make it to my list.\n\nAfter hearing two disappointing studio albums from their group, I had come to a conclusion that their later releases are equally that mediocre. I never really thought that Machine Head's generic groovy metal could get worse, and then I heard their third studio album which paraded their shifting from groove-thrash to a more nu-metal tainted sound. And like the possible reaction of fellow metalheads when they first heard the release, I was in a point where I couldn't care less about them anymore. However, I accidentally bumped into their fourth offering \"Supercharger\", as it was playing on a stereo when I was in a record store scanning over some good music materials. Man, \"Supercharger\" is utterly worse!\n\nThis fourth offering is mostly composed of awfully bad riffs, recycled from \"The Burning Red\", deteriorated down predominantly on one to two guitar chords without any accommodation of authentic solos. In the majority of the album, the presence of the bass is not even noticeable. The bass was tuned flat down and it plays no role in the album, as it only follows and plays as a shadow to the guitar most of the time. This issue is identical with the drum section too. Dave's drumming performance here is in beyond belief simplistic and it suffers a great lack of punch. Like how the bass was done in this offering, the drums only trailed behind the groovy riffs and it did not display any surface of rage or technical nature. And finally Rob's despicable vocal performance summed up the album's appallingly inferior value.\n\nYou would have expected that Machine Head had learned from \"The Burning Red\", yet by some means they dug deeper into nu-metal's even more mushy department. On a whole, this record is an abhorrent album on the band's already dreadful r\u00e9sum\u00e9. This is what happens when a band is more focused about the fame and money, instead of creating good and compelling music for their passion. Eventually they learned after this album and they went back on doing lackluster post-thrash metal, rather than fabricating a clich\u00e9 of nu-metal garbage.\n",
        "\nAfter The Blackening was dropped in 2007, Machine Head once more cemented themselves as one of the strongest forces of modern metal. After years of putting out nu metal-esque albums, the band had gained a somewhat stained reputation. It's up to every individual to debate themselves whether or not Machine Head deserved all the bad rep or not, but they (i.e. frontman and founding member Robb Flynn) do indeed come across as being somewhat of a bunch of trend-hoppers. The Blackening sure wasn't an exception in this regard. While definitely sounding heavier and more \"metal\" than the band had done since the mid-90's, it still followed a typical groovy metalcore-esque formula of its time.\n\nAfter touring the world in support of the band's massively successful 2007 album for a few years, the band finally released a new album in 2011. Unto The Locust is more or less the natural progression you'd expect the band to go for after such an album as The Blackening. It's clear that the band opted to keep that successful recipe boiling in the kitchen pot as there are not a whole lot of changes, despite four whole years passing by in between the albums' releases. The most noticeable differences are perhaps how Unto The Locust doesn't have as many lengthy tracks as its predecessor, as well as being somewhat less heavy in favor of a slightly more \"easy accessed\" direction.\n\nAs the album kicks off with \"I Am Hell (Sonata in C#)\", it's already evident that the band has tried to evolve the classical influences which were largely introduced on the previous album. I can't help but get the feeling that it seems somewhat forced upon the music, like an obvious attempt at trying to make the music sound \"epic\" or whatever, but to little avail. Apart from the classical elements, the songs are as I mentioned earlier more easy accessed this time around. Tracks like \"This Is The End\" is kind of similar to \"Halo\" in how it's built, featuring a clean acoustic intro which breaks out into a quite heavy banger, completed with a rather whiney clean-sung chorus. The band also gives us a purer semi-acoustic performance in the dark, modern power ballad \"Darkness Within\", whose sound feels quite innovative but not far-fetched for MH standards.\n\nThe musicianship on this album is one of the greatest highlights. Everyone's a very competent musician with the only exception possibly being Robb's vocal skills. The man can shout his way through songs but his clean vocals still leave a few things to be desired. Robb's (and Phil's) guitar work, however, is just great. Machine Head's got some of the strongest twin- and dual-guitar work going on in modern/popular metal. Dave McClain is as always a real powerhouse drummer delivering all the good tom fills and whatnot, while Adam Duce provides some monstrous bass lines and harmonic back-up vocals. The production, which was once more handled by Robb, is also clean and crisp. It works well for the songs and manages to enhance them to their full potential as well.\n\nWhile Unto The Locust is not really a bad album, it left me feeling disappointed. I thought The Blackening was quite excellent but this album just sounds weak and pale in comparison. All the real heavy and thrashy moments on The Blackening have been largely neglected on this album in favor of more poppy approaches. \"Who We Are\" for instance has got a very whiney and annoying children's choir singing the chorus. \"Darkness Within\" on the other hand sounds like a real cringe-fest which would make every edgy emo-kid soak himself for days. I just don't like these approaches at all. I miss the heavy Machine Head I used to know and love.\n\nAt the end of the day, seeing how many similarities this album bears to The Blackening, the proper title for this should've just been \"The Weakening\" instead. That much better sums up what this album is, as well as what musical direction the band has continued to strive for on subsequent releases.\n",
        "\nI don't understand this band. Why would they think going back to playing nu-metal would be a good move? This is an epic failure of massive proportions. \n\nRob Flynn shouting \"Is There Anybody Out There?\" is supposedly the \"hook\" of this song. He shouts it roughly 15-20 times throughout it. Let's talk about this guy's voice. First off, he's mostly rapping. Well, he's rapping during all of the verses anyways. The band goes back and forth between playing a nu-metalish riff and then cutting out so we get to hear Flynn's horrible rapping and juvenile lyrics isolated by themselves. Machine Head had been garnering a small amount of respect in the metal community for their previous works, but this is just a gigantic leap in the wrong direction. Flynn's rapping has this sort of tough guy attitude about it, yet he's crying for help at the same time, pleading for someone to step in and save him. Right. As if his life is really so bad that he has to turn back to his teenaged, angst ridden attitude of the past. It's just a cry for attention. As for his singing abilities, well, he can't really sing. His tone and method of delivery is bad. His use of vocal fry is also bad. His harmonies are weak. Overall, he just doesn't have a good metal voice. Though I personally wouldn't enjoy listening to him sing in ANY genre, he would be much better suited for emo or metalcore, rather than metal. Unfortunately his vocal influences are poorly grounded, and he ought to rebuild his whole voice from the ground up, this time using better sources of inspiration. \n\nBefore the awful chorus is the prechorus, where the band sounds full out 'core. This is where we get those sad sounding, emotional clean vocals, which sound wimpy as hell. The instrumentation is minimal, and the drums are as bare boned as possible. They did add a string section to their chorus, but it really sounds bad. The guitars sound heavy but it's not the good kind of heavy. It's more that chugga chugga type of stuff which aside from the heaviness doesn't actually share much in common with the musical aspects of the metal riff. The riff as it's written isn't that bad, but the tone used and the way it is mastered just comes out sounding like this overly processed, computerized crap that has no place in rock and roll. There aren't any guitar solos either. \n\nThat about sums it up. This band just plain sucks, and this song is embarrassing. I wouldn't be caught dead listening to this kind of garbage.\n",
        "\nNow, I'm no avid fan of Machine Head, so my opinion probably doesn't correspond to those of true MH fans, but from what I can tell so far, this song is not well liked. Most of the problems I have with this are personal problems, an issue with the song that just irks me.\n\nFirst, this style of music does not suit them. Trying to play a four-minute nu metal song is well and all, but it sounds like a combination of Slipknot and Skillet, two VERY different rock band. And THAT'S just the chorus, the part that I like the most due to it's annoying, yet likeable catchiness. The true sound of Machine Head, to me, is the six to ten minute groove/thrash mastery found on Unto The Locust and Bloodstone & Diamonds. Not some cheesy mallcore-sounding crap you'd hear blaring out of some emo rockstar wannabe's headphones, as can be heard here.\n\nThe next problem is the lack of guitar in the verses when Flynn sings. Not that it would have made it much better, mind you. The lyrics in these verses sound like they're trying to appeal to the fanbase of bands such as Korn, Killswitch Engage or the infamous Slipknot, and have probably done very well in that aspect. Not all is lost, however, as the drumming is still done well here, albeit rather blandly. All in all, the guitars are excellent, the drumming is passable, the chorus is catchy and the vocals are as great as ever, showing a wide range of what Flynn is capable of. Unfortunately, these are mashed into one song with one majorly glaring problem: The awful songwriting.\n\nThe elephant in the room is the song is composed terribly, and whilst the song is meant to show Phil's little racist incident, that doesn't excuse the fact that it's like this, as they have done so much better in the past, highlight songs being This Is The End (Unto The Locust), Halo (The Blackening) and Game Over (Bloodstone & Diamonds).\n\nSo, we conclude that this song is great for the genre it's composed in, but it's just a waste of talent compared to what MH can really do. And if it's a bad review, I apologize, as it is my first review on the site.\n",
        "\nIt's unusual for a band so deep into their recording career to suddenly have a moment of clarity, but Machine Head's 2011 album sure was an oddly organized way to condense the bands strengths and ambitions into one discrete package. The most shocking part seems to be that the band finally found a songwriting style that didn't piss off about half their listeners, as can be evidenced from the generally positive reviews for Unto the Locust, as opposed to the love it/hate it reactions that the other albums have received. I bought this album soon after its release and wasn't immediately pleased with it, which probably on reflection comes down to the more complex touches and slightly random insertions that mark this out from the long (yet not progressive) The Blackening.\n\nFollowing on from the tendency of The Blackening not to do anything too simply where complexity is possible, the songs here all last more than 5 minutes and many feel like they carry something extra in their length. 'I Am Hell' brings with it a silly crooned intro and that annoying '(Sonata in C#)' addition to its title, 'Darkness Within' could have done with cutting some of the plainer acoustic work to streamline the song, 'This Is the End' simply doesn't need an acoustic opening, and 'Who We Are' commits the mortal sin of using a children's choir. The latter example also clearly begs the question, do Machine Head think they are a children's choir? A ponder-worthy question, I think. However, also following on from The Blackening, the band bring some good riffs to the table and haven't forgotten that Phil Demmell and Robb Flynn are really good at solos when they think carefully about them. The band's continuing affiliation with contemporary musical trends continues, though thankfully they have been leaders rather than followers since Through the Ashes of Empires, here pursuing more technical and melodic ideas alongside the familiar groove and metalcore elements.\n\nOne feature that does somewhat annoyingly remain in Machine Head's music is their tendency to mash together creative content with some completely uninspired sections, so that songs can topple from captivating to redundant in a matter of seconds. For example, the largely fresh and exciting 'This Is the End' wisely boots its introduction out of the way with a sparkling melodeath tremolo, giving way to a technical groove thrash riff, then the first riff returns with slightly offputting clean vocals for the chorus; the cycle repeats and another kind of melodic thrashy riff opens the door to a slow contemplative riff replete with signature MH harmonics; for a few seconds it breaks into downtuned groove chug fills and then the solo bursts out over the top of similar riffing, which, by way of a brief melody, fits back into the chorus. That's quite a complicated description, so suffice it to say that everything is nice except for the clean vocals (though not horrible and not too intrusive) and the random chugging build-up to the solo. The same thing happens in most of the songs here, the larger pieces tending to be made of silver or gold, while transition elements or short parts seem to solder everything together with tin, leaving obvious weak points.\n\nAside from this occasional sloppiness, Unto the Locust throws out some surprises that work incredibly well. 'Darkness Within' is an unthinkable song in the context of the band's discography, yet the simple acoustic verses are very effective, while the growth of the song from pop ballad to soaring anthem is awesome to behold. Of course, that doesn't stop the band throwing in a metalcore breakdown after the solo, but we always knew that Robb Flynn's ambition is separated from his reason. 'Locust' also twists itself into a multitude of shapes, starting out with a deceptively simple bass riff and shuddering groove heaviness before hammering things home with one of the best choruses from MH and a lead full of light and shade, reminiscent of 'Master of Puppets'. The most surprising thing might actually be the venturing of 'Pearls Before the Swine', 'I Am Hell', and 'Who We Are' into real thrash territory, which surprises on two counts: that MH have always dallied with thrash without actually getting there, and that those thrash parts sit alongside many more typical metalcore parts than before, with proper breakdowns in several songs.\n\nEven five years after first hearing it, Unto the Locust still seems unexpected to me and remains a little strange. It strikes me that the strangeness might be a result of MH suddenly becoming leaders of modern metal again, since the success and popularity of The Blackening put them back in a position that they hadn't been in since the release of Burn My Eyes, which was followed up by the weird The More Things Change. Whatever the reason, some of the songwriting could have been further tweaked to run all the good ideas together more smoothly, as well as excess detailing cut to allow the exciting parts to dominate. However, the overall quality is strong and the songs fairly consistent, if not the absolute best of the band's career. I'm still gaping, but I'll shut my mouth now - just in case a locust flies in.\n",
        "\nBurn My Eyes is an album that is routinely pointed to as the shining beacon in Machine Head's catalogue; it is considered a milestone in '90s metal and the work upon which their reputation and sound were forged upon - to this day, it remains one of their bestselling releases. Even detractors of the band and of groove metal as a whole will single it out as a diamond in the rough - and while I am one such detractor of both the band and a lot of groove metal I still maintain that this is a god-awful pile of grating slop. At no point across Machine Head's 9 albums (as of writing this) have they ever managed a song that isn't terrible dreck and Burn My Eyes does not buck that trend.\n\nCompared to their later work this is a substantially more straightforward affair; none of the attempts at extended 'progressive' or 'epic' songs are to be found here. No, on this album the band's sound amounts to nothing more than Chaos A.D/Pantera/Metallica worship with a penchant for down tuning and more acoustic balladry borrowed from alternative rock bands of the day. The heavier moments here are driven by ultimately derivative, clunky and tedious grooves that feel like castoffs from those aforementioned far superior albums and bands, with only a few riffs such as the principle riff of 'Davidian' or the verse riff of 'Old' really standing out in any way. The faster sections are so-so but a lot of the time the music is very mid-tempo, and the band simply cannot do crushing mid-tempo grooves without making the songs totally boring. The grooves are simpler and muddier than anything heard on a Pantera release, and are fairly interchangeable across the entire album due to a lack of melody and a lack of variation between them. Also of note are songs such as 'None but My Own' or 'Blood for Blood' which feature heavy sections that are loaded with irritating guitar squeals that prove to be truly grating to listen to. \n\nWorse than these heavy moments though are the more melodic and atmospheric sections, which aren't very interesting to begin with (comprised of more melodic guitar work or a humdrum acoustic guitar line) but also feature the worst of Robb's vocals. His vocals during the album's more intense moments aren't good to begin with; he attempts a gritty hardcore-ish bellow that sounds comical and tryhard, nothing like Phil Anselmo or Max Cavalera, but they at least sort of work for material that goes as hard and fast as 'Old's verses as he doesn't draw out his vocal lines to the point of irritation. However, on that and many other songs here whatever okay material the band manage is thrown out for these atmospheric or melodic sections that feature his weak and whiny grunge-inspired clean vocals, which totally wreck the mood. Even during the album's heavier but slower moments, his drawn out shouts sound terrible and not at all aggressive. Robb also attempts something approaching rapping on the Biohazard-influenced 'A Thousand Lies', this sounds as corny as you would imagine; the groove that backs up these verses being one of the most redundant and basic on the entire album.\n\nThere are other problems too - the production for instance is a double-edged sword; the music sounds undeniably heavy and crisp in the way Metallica is but everything is so consistently loud and polished it becomes grating to listen to after a while, especially with the numerous shots of guitar noise that litter several songs or the consistent crashing of the drums - this album epitomises the word 'overproduced'. On top of this, the songs themselves are overly long and repetitive with a lot of repeated riffs, a lack of flow between sections and recycled ideas throughout the tracklist. A lot of the songs past the first 3 are half-ballads, with boring groove sections jammed up against totally grating atmospheric sections, and as a result these tracks rarely pick up any sort of steam. The heavier moments during these songs are slower and so can't rely on speed to get by; they get tiresome very quickly as a result. Even when the album throws something different out it's not for the better, with the aforementioned 'Blood for Blood' being an overly repetitive fast number with too much guitar noise and not enough ideas to stay interesting for its short duration and 'Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies' being a sample-heavy piece of go-nowhere filler that rides a slow and dull groove riff.\n\nAdmittedly, there are some okay riffs and the drumming can get quite frantic and technical with a lot of double bass and fills thrown into numerous songs (the most obvious example being 'Davidian'), and the soloing is pretty good too and does well to break up these otherwise boring and mediocre songs. Beyond this however, there isn't much that can be said in favour of this album - metal is more than a collection of cool solos and drumming and this has no actual good songs to speak of. It has redundant and derivative riffs, terrible vocals, flat songwriting, bad production, a lack of overall inspiration and ideas (and what few ideas the band has are lacklustre to begin with), and I don't see why anyone would want to listen to it.\n\nIf Pantera sucked as hard as purists claim, you'd have this album.\n",
        "\nMy problems with this song are purely musical, Phil Anselmo's racist and idiotic actions from earlier this year are fully worthy of condemnation. but if you're going to do that, at least provide a decent song.\n\nMuch of this song has Robb spitting out verses in the style of Mike Shinoda, and that makes his vocal approach seem awkward and forced. He even cry-sings in parts and that just ruins it for me, I thought that you left that behind with Supercharger! (Machine Head's worst album) There is also only one real riff that makes its way into the song and the overall structure is simple verse-chorus with a buildup to a soft part and then going back to the verse-chorus. The guitar assault stops to make way for forced semi-rapped vocals and a nu-metallish childhood story. This song is just not constructed well.\n\nGone is the grandiosity of the past 3 albums and instead the lead single treats us to a much more simplified and less able Machine Head. This does not have me hopeful for the future album's release. He seems to be taking this band back to the Supercharger days and that is something nobody wanted to hear, as someone who loved the past four Machine Head albums for their grandiosity and complexity, this is a massive step backwards. Please Robb, this is not worth it, take a step back, calm down, and think about what you are doing, this is not good for any of us.\n",
        "\nCheesy, angsty and utter shit. I could probably end the review here, but for the sake of filling it out a little, I won't. This is shocking. I never really cared for Machine Head, and only briefly skimmed through their material. Some of it was okay'ish, but nothing too interesting. This, however, is interesting, or should I say fascinating, because of how horrible it is.\n\nThis is mallcore crap. It sounds like Robb Flynn morphed into a 16 year old boy who just experienced his first break-up. Watered-down chugging, annoying little guitar squeals, cringe-worthy lyrics, yep, \"Is There Anybody Out There?\" has got it all. Though, there's nothing remotely memorable or catchy about this track. Some of the emo-tinged nu-metal has got at least a little catchy moment, be it a decent solo or catchy melodies, but none of those are found here.\n\n\"Is There Anybody Out There?\" sounds like a metal cover of a song by The Smiths, that is just terribly executed. The weird \"whistling\" in the beginning of the song and before the final \"hooray\", sounds like the whistling heard in the movie '500 Days of Summer', which makes the whole The Smiths thing even more legit.\n\nAfter a few listens, it's still difficult to remember anything. This song leaves a bad taste of shit in your mouth, but you can't really remember why. It is that bad. Bands release songs that could be considered fillers all the time, and it's rare to find an album that is fantastic and memorable from start to finish, but this is Machine Head's latest single. The only thing I remember is the \"IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THEEEEERE\" bit, which is the ultimate moment of cringe here.\n\nPositives? Well, at least Robb Flynn sings with a bit of conviction. It sounds like he really means this, which begs the question of where he is mentally. Is he going to be okay? His vocals are by no means outstanding, but he's the only one trying, it seems, and this is why it doesn't get a rock-bottom 0% score. Flynn should be an actor and star in the next American Pie movie, since he's good at pretending to be a teenager, even though, he's a grown ass man.\n\nOverall, \"Is There Anybody Out There?\" is a horrible, yet unmemorable, song that further proves that Machine Head are a ridiculously overrated band.\n",
        "\nThis song sucks hard. Really hard. And I'm a big nu metal fan, but this is a real nadir for the band. Not The Burning Red, or Supercharger, but THIS. It features a really big downfall for the band, and for their reputation as a band \"resurrected from the dead.\"\n\nAlthough it isn't Davidian or Aesthetics of Hate, the riff is is pretty decent- but it is still very boring and repetitive for consisting of barely 2 or 3 power chords. Heck, even Limp Bizkit's Break Stuff has more deepness and musical variety than this song. After the riff ends (which takes about 5 seconds) it shifts into a really bad clean-only section (which is something like 5 Seconds of Summer would do), which comes back to about a couple of the riff-repeating, not before a really horrendous mallcore-catchy chorus comes in. And this formula accompanies the entire song, which can sure make a man go insane.\n\nThe musical variety, except for the things listed above, is really the lowest the band has ever achieved. The drums here SUCK. Simple bass-drum-whatever stuff that Limp Bizkit can do better. They are played in a beat that resembles a head that is banging on a wall, which is exactly what will happen as soon as you turn on this almost-5-minutes of manure. Even the lyrics here are atrocious, but in a very funny way. They rabble about Phil Anselmo's \"WHITE POWER!!!\" incident, but don't describe it well and instead sound like a typical love/hate teen anger wank-fest:\n\nIs the fear to speak that no one dares\nSo will I stand here all alone?\nLive my life like I\u2019ll die tonight\nDream like I\u2019ll live forever\"\n\nSo skip this if you haven't understood that from this review and the ones before me. Go listen to good nu metal like early Korn, Snot, Soulfly, and even Slipknot, to get an idea of what better nu metal sounds like.\n\nOh, and Phil, please don't do that \"WHITE POWER!!!\" mistake again so it won't inspire writing shitty songs like this.\n",
        "\nI started listening to metal when I found bands like Machine Head and other nu-metal or even metalcore (but not mallcore) bands. Those days belong to the past even if once in a while I choose to return to some of my all time favorites. I remember how 'Unto the Locust' seemed pretty damn heavy to me back then and I can even recall reading articles about how influential Machine Head's debut has been. So the question here is: what happened? Is Mr. Robb Flynn getting old or is this song that much of a piece of crap that it takes only three to four listens to make your mind up and scorch it with such a rating. If you have ever read any review of mine (surely by accident of course) you probably know that I always try to find something to praise. Only few albums get ratings below 30% but trust me if negative ratings were a thing here, I could use one right now.\n\nIt's not just the bland songwriting, the tiring everlasting buildup that never gets a proper tension releasing break or the fact that there is no solo. It is the reason behind this track's existence that makes me cringe. You all know the incident that occurred back in winter (it was winter right?) with Phil Anselmo. The guy had the whole world hating him and I won't lie: I was very upset by that story as well. Robb Flynn made a video about that, uploaded it and it was cool. He just stated his opinion and that is perfect with me. On the other hand Anselmo was apologizing once every two days. So why the fuck would you take it to such lengths Robb? Just because someone has an opinion that doesn't fit yours, that automatically means you have to keep hating and even try to humiliate him? I'm not taking this any further because the single's quality speaks for itself. There is none.\n\nMusic wise, this is despair incarnate. Not like the depressive suicidal black metal (DSBM) despair. More like: \"This sucks so much, I want to end my life\" despair. Have you ever wondered how a boyband producing a 'metal' track would sound like? Listen to this and find out. Have you ever wondered what a track with about two different beats and shitty riffs and NO FUCKING GUITAR SOLO would sound like? Listen to this and find out. Have you ever wondered what a frog with a sore throat trying to scream would sound like? You guessed it! Listen to this and find out. Sorry Robb but your band is going downwards lately. And it's okay. But being a big bully to someone you have already confronted is not okay. Basically you promote EXACTLY the same attitude as him and maybe even worse. Stick to making your band great again and leave that bullshit aside. Avoid this abomination of a single at all costs guys there's nothing of worth here.\n\nFavorite tracks: Read the review again. You see it now? The answer is NO WAY!\n\n0/100.\n",
        "\nWhen I did my review for Machine Head's last album, 2014's \"Bloodstone & Diamonds\", I was far from impressed. Machine Head always was one of those hit-or-miss kind of bands that could never keep consistent from album-to-album, and their latest album was somewhat of a confirmation that things aren't heading towards the better. In fact, there was the song \"Now We Die\" which refrain I even made a pun of in the review title for that album. Safe to say, that album was something of their burial casket for me.\n\nSo where do we have the boys now in 2016? Well, if the last album was bad (and it was), then I don't really have any good news here. Many still remember earlier in Machine Head's career when they did one particularly horrendous album, which was \"Supercharger\" in 2001. It was in the midst of their nu-metal crisis and the band had totally lost all its balls from their early albums. Now this song is once again a huge step into that very direction, and dare I say that this time is even worse than the last one.\n\nThe song itself is really disappointing as far as a Machine Head (could) go. It sounds extremely uninspired and just made up rather quickly during some slow afternoon in the back of their tour bus. What makes it even worse are the lyrics and the rap-style vocals which feel forced. \"Is there anybody out there?\" sure is a title that sounds like a call-out of some sort, and it is about Robb calling out Phil Anselmo earlier this year after the latter got drunk and made his infamous Nazi-salute at some show. Robb Flynn did a fairly beheld YouTube video after the incident in which he attacked Anselmo together with the rest of the world, and everybody thought that was that. But no, now Machine Head returns with this single and according to Robb Flynn this is, once again, at least partially about Anselmo and his mistake. \n\nThis song felt old before its first note had even reached my ears. The fact that it's another attack from Robb Flynn, on a man who has already apologized officially (about three times) in the media, is just sad and a rather obvious proof of Flynn's infamous self-righteousness. What is even more sad is the fact that this song is so fucking bad that it was Machine Head's nail in the coffin for me. Sorry Robb, nobody is gonna answer your call.\n",
        "\nI really don't understand what happened here. Machine Head has never been a band that particularly blew me away, although they managed to put on a good live show when I saw them three years ago, and I fairly enjoy most of their music. I just don't go out of my way to listen to them half of the time. \"Is There Anybody Out There?\" is the latest track from Flynn and Co. What baffles me is that this is basically an even more watered down \"Supercharger\" with additional mallcore sprinkled on top. Coming from someone who enjoys a few bands labeled as \"mallcore\", this song serves no purpose. \n\nI didn't listen to the last album \"Bloodstone & Diamonds\" although I enjoyed \"Unto the Locust\" quite a bit when it first dropped. Basically it added a bit more technicality and progression to the band's groove/thrash metal sound that they established in the mid 1990s. This song seems to resemble \"The Burning Red\" and \"Supercharger\" with it returning to the nu metal sound the band experimented with on those two albums at the turn of the century. Except it sounds even more watered down than those two albums! Which I didn't even know was possible. The riffs are extremely boring nu metal crunches that only add more teenage angst to the music. Just give Robb Flyn a fucking Snickers, for the sake of the gods!\n\nOh, and where is the solo? I've heard \"Bloodstone & Diamonds\" had some killer solos, and I KNOW \"Unto the Locus\" does. There is no solo in this song to give the music room to breathe, it just sucks 100% of the time. Bad Machine Head, bad! Really wish I could get the 4 and a half minutes of my life I wasted listening to this back, but oh well...\n",
        "\nMachine Head is one of those bands that seems dead set on destroying themselves every time they manage to gain a little bit of that long-lost credibility that some of their membership had during the thrash craze of the late 80s. What's worse is that the personality at the center of it all, namely Robb Flynn, has been completely oblivious to the fact that he's been out of the whole non-conformist game for quite a while and, all tough guy posturing and other assorted bullshit aside, has become an aging trend-hopper with little grounding to speak of. Nevertheless, they began to show some signs of coalescence around a modern groove/thrash sound with some quirky progressive trimmings around the edges on their last couple albums and even managed a few winning songs here and there. With the tide of current events, however, this upward trend was cut off at the knees with what could be described as Machine Head's worst song to date, and a long-feared return to the horrid nu-metal days of this band's middle era that even their detractors were happy to see go for greener pastures.\n\nIs There Anybody Out There is a perfectly horrendous throwback to this band's mallcore sophomore opus Supercharger, complete with all the usual trimmings. Amid the assorted mishmashes of \"emotional\" whispered speaking, bad imitations of the prototypical grunge vocal persona or \"yarl\", some short yet extremely off-putting spoken/rapped passages and a really whiny pseudo-gruff singing style that's about as close to Fred Durst territory as can be, something is clearly absent. This missing element is what is known by most as a metal song, as in something with some kind of riff activity beyond banging and chugging on a few chords and mixing in a bunch of grating, high end guitar drones. Even by the over-simplified standard of groove metal, this doesn't come close to making the cut and sounds castrated even compared to the deepest nadir of Soulfly's early output. One is forced to ask yet another question in \"Why the fuck is Phil Demmel even in the band anymore?\" given the lack of any kind of noteworthy lead guitar activity, let alone the respectable guitar solo work that painted much of Unto The Locust and Bloodstone And Diamonds.\n\nFrom start to finish, this is an unadulterated shit storm of pseudo-epic proportions. How anyone can like this and the last couple Machine Head albums simultaneously defies logic, as they can not be any more diametrically opposed to each other musically. There is no excuse for crap like this, even from the likes of Robb Flynn, who seems to want to be both Jonathan Davis and PC Principal. Sure, it's understandable to think that Phil Anselmo is an idiot and that his onstage antics border on retarded, such is the nature of people who get drunk off their ass and then proceed to make tasteless jokes while onstage. But lyrically indicting all but the entire metal scene because of this makes Flynn an even bigger douche bag than Anselmo, not to mention drawing further questions about Flynn's preference to money over substance. But even without the lyrics under consideration, this should come with the label: \"Warning: Listening to this will likely cause your ears to contract AIDS, hit the play button at your own risk.\"\n",
        "\n'Is There Anybody Out There?' was a single that came out in the wake of Phil Anselmo shouting 'white power' at a show and Robb Flynn's subsequent rant about it online, something released as a call for anybody who found Phil's behaviour and similar incidents detestable to push back one way or another. Musically or lyrically this didn't win over many fans and with the benefit of hindsight, was a precursor to their abominable 2018 album Catharsis. It is possibly one of the worst songs the band has ever released and the band in question is Machine Head, so that really is saying something.\n\nThis song returns to a modernised form of the nu metal sound present on Supercharger, in that it's laden with effects and the vocals are pushed to the forefront with the guitars taking a back seat. There is only one riff in the song, a 3 note groove found in the intro, after the chorus, and in the verses - albeit in a stop-start form. It's not at all interesting, aggressive, heavy or memorable in any way but honestly the song isn't that guitar driven so this isn't the biggest issue (but it doesn't help, given how bad everything else is.) There are various melodic accents to the song; whistling keyboards, leads and a more melodic groove under the verses, that are all designed to give this song the melodrama it needs to go with its very important lyrics. At one point towards the end these all coalesce in a quiet section with background vocals to heighten the angst and bleeding-heart factor to levels only seen from the likes of metalcore or modern post-hardcore; only it doesn't manage to stir any sort of emotional response in the listener, which is a problem when the song is trying so hard to do so for the sake of its message. There isn't even a solo to give some sort of respite; the entire backdrop to this thing fails at being aggressive or emotionally compelling.\n\nAs stated the song isn't very instrumentally oriented, with more emphasis being placed on the vocals. This speaks to its construction as a vehicle for preaching and putting the message before the music, given how effortless and dull the instruments are. The vocal performance is equally terrible, with Flynn's standard overdone melodic shouting over the chorus that shoots for aggressive and powerful but ends up being try-hard; even Phil Anselmo with his lacerated throat and smoker's lungs sounded more convincingly angry around this time than Robb does here. The verses are delivered over that stop-start groove, with the groove stopping for Robb to give two lines at a time in a really wimpy semi-spoken/semi-melodic delivery that is again trying too hard to be angsty. Things get very Asking Alexandria-esque during the bridge where his distorted vocals come over a chugging breakdown, and then his layered clean vocals are sung over strings and keyboards; it's laughably melodramatic and clich\u00e9 and he sounds terrible. Never mind the lyrics, which read like an attack on people for allowing racism to continue - which is true for some of course but this isn't how you win people over; you come across as preachy and condescending.\n\nThis track is a preachy, clich\u00e9d mess. It was plainly written just to get a message across and Robb needed what he thought would be an ideal backdrop to sell his crucial message to anyone who would listen. What resulted was a terrible hybrid of nu metal and metalcore with some of the worst vocals and instrumentation the band has ever done, even including Catharsis. The band's attempts at being heavy here don't work, only beating out their two nu metal albums in that regard and the attempts at being emotional are so corny as to be laughable and pathetic. Obviously Robb doesn't know what sells lyrically or musically among the metal community; his whole crusade against Phil was met with snorts of derision from metal fans at large while this song bombed, and with good reason.\n",
        "\nThis doesn't sound like anything off of Blackening or Unto the Locust (you know, decent thrash metal). No, this is Machine Head returning to their crappy, nu-metal, Supercharger-era sound.\n\nAfter a boring opening the song launches into a rhythm section so generic that it sounds like Slipknot wrote it. Machine Head has written some catchy riffs but this is one is purely unmemorable. Rob sounds best when he is growling his lyrics instead of singing them, so it is a shame that he mainly sticks to the latter. What is worse is how uninspired the lyrics are (not joking, half of the lyrics are \"is there anybody out there?\"). How is this the same person who wrote Aesthetics of Hate?\n\nThe chorus is overly melodic and unmemorable and wouldn't be out of place on a popular radio station (which isn't good). The use of violins doesn't work in this song like it did in the songs off of Bloodstone and Diamonds. Here it comes off cheesy instead of majestic. \n\nMaybe, I thought, the song would improve after the second chorus. Nope. The bridge is just a re-hash of the boring intro. No interesting riffs. No solo even. The lead guitar hardly does anything for that matter. Cue a final chorus and the song ends.\n\nIf I wasn't a fan of the band then this song would give me absolutely no desire to check out their other material. But since I am a fan it pains me to hear them make a song so terrible. Come on guys, I'm trying to forget about your late 90s/early 2000s output.\n",
        "\nIn the wake of the whole Phil Anselmo \u2013 white supremacist fiasco, Flava Flynn has yet again decided to cash in on the whole ordeal by doing what he does best \u2013 by releasing really, really shitty, faceless music. Instead of not letting the embarrassingly shameful debacles of a drunken buffoon get to him, and letting the whole thing go like everyone else did, we are granted with this travesty. What we have here sounds like every nu-metal/metalcore/post-hardcore/whatever song in existence, only this time tinged with more whiny Asking Alexandria and Black Veil Brides influences than even the most hardened M.H. fan should be comfortable with, and painted with all the radio-friendly, melodic prose of your average Sleeping With Sirens track.\n\nWhile I have not heard much from the previous two Machine Head LPs released since \u201cThe Blackening\u201d, I can still recognize the good ol' Machine Head pallet \u2013 more shitty nu-metal grooves that shy away inconsequentially beneath the vocals that sits obnoxiously high in the overly-produced mix, with a format of alternating between tuff-guy core vocals and whiny whispered parts that directly rip off Johnathan Davis, and a pseudo-epic yet cringe-inducing chorus that recalls your average metalcore song. There seems to be some limp synth-string layers here and there throughout the choruses, flaunted even further around two minutes and forty seconds in, when the song just falls apart into a pit of unintentional hilarity. Much of what made the better songs in Machine Head's catalog so great are missing here, namely with songs like \u201cWolves\u201d which hinted at some crushing thrash mastery, or \u201cHalo\u201d and \u201cClenching the Fists of Dissent\u201d with their stylistic riff variations. \u201cIs Anybody Out There?\u201d just sounds like your typical \u201cA Day to Remember\u201d-esque, gauged-earing-wearing radio-pop with some Slipknot thrown in.\n\nIt's just ironic that this song is a diss track towards Phil Anselmo, seeing as Machine Head is a more or less a Pantera copy band and all... Also strange is the lyrical subject matter at hand, as it sounds as if this song is meant to appeal to metalcore kiddies who most likely wouldn't know (or care of) the situation \u2013 that being Anselmo's racist dumbassery at the 2016 Dimebash. It's just a completely inexplicable cash grab of a track, and I know the band members are capable of better. Rob, please get back with Vio-Lence, where your talents matter the most.\n\nI know this is a rather short review, but there is really not much to say about this song \u2013 it just simply fucking sucks.\n",
        "\nAnother day, another flashy, inconsequential and utterly terrible album hyped up to be an earth-shattering modern classic. If I was a 'metal person' around this time, and this was the album to signify a thrash metal revival... then I would disregard modern thrash altogether, to be honest. This isn't anything new; this isn't even anything remotely good. This isn't even thrash about 90% of the time. This is nothing more than an exercise in blatantly taking influence from creative wells visited thousands of times before, and unlike the retro-thrash scene that was brewing around the same time, this tries to package it as something amazing and new, as opposed to being blatant hero-worship. And good god is this one unholy aberration of an album. It draws from a variety of influences, not having a single original or fresh bone in its body (it is Machine Head, after all), and still manages to fuck it all up because the band are a bunch of hacks and the music they are aping wasn't that good to begin with for the most part.\n\nWithin this album's bloated confines, Machine Head (or should I say, Robbbbb Flynnnnn) saw content to throw a bastardised Pantera-worship groove sound (so, Burn My Eyes, sub-Reinventing the Steel Skinlab level stuff), utterly terrible grungy nu 'metal' pseudo-melodic clean parts (The Burning Red, a.k.a. bastardised Limp Bizkit and Korn worship), shitty screeching (Supercharger) and then decides to apply all of that, along with the sterilised, neutered thrash riffs of Trivium to a ridiculously extended variation of the overstretched framework of Through the Ashes of Empires, i.e: worshiping Master of Puppets in all the wrong ways.\n\nSound appealing? I thought not. For this album, the band looked to the past. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, the problem is that Machine Head's past is just a hideous parody of whatever was popular a few years before said album, and rather than try and improve on past works, they make a sort of kitchen sink album that flogs all of the tired clich\u00e9s of their past discography to death. How the fuck this of all things is considered acceptable is mind-boggling. This is pure, unmitigated shit.\n\nThe guitars are for the most part, absolutely terrible. There are a few passable thrash riffs buried in these songs, but even they come across as really weak and ballless due to that limp-wristed, overly clean guitar tone. They bring to mind modern Exodus more than say, modern Overkill, if that gives some insight as to how they sound. No matter how hard this band tries to thrash it up, the lingering stench of modern '-core' is always there, and that manifests itself in the stupid guitar screeching that somehow passes for 'ambiance' and an actual point of contrast within each song. Even the absolute best track here, 'Aesthetics of Hate', which mostly keeps it succinct, devolves into this tuneless squealing part towards the end. And of course, being Machine Head, they gotta go for the groove. Oh yes, can't stay fast for too long, else it would be no fun at the concerts! The album is full of annoying groovy parts guising as thrash breaks that serve only to throw off any continuity and pacing to the songs, are so stale by this point that they are basically pure rot. \n\nThe bass reinforces the riffs, trying desperately to prop up and support all the bullshit going on with the guitars... but you can't hold up an unstable, crumbling, hideous tower with a toothpick. And indeed, two toothpicks would be no better, for despite the slightly noodling, indulgent nature of the soloing that is all too redolent of the incentive Pantera offered to listeners for going through their worst songs; they are still a much needed break from the terrible, weak riffs. The drums are decent, throwing in a few fills and a lot of double bass, bringing back fond memories of this outfits' only good song ('Davidian'), and serves as the highlight to the album and GAAAH! \n\nI can't put it off any longer! Robbbbb here must be held accountable for his crimes against humanity's ears and any decent vocalist that has ever existed. His voice is so unbelievably shite, it is on the same level as Anders Frid\u00e9n or Dave Mustaine on Super Collider. He looks towards a fusion of Pantera circa Vulgar Display of Power - that being a vaguely tonal hardcore shout - and fuses it with the inherently toothless and emaciated nature of his 'aggressive' vocal work on this band's nu 'metal' stuff. The end result is an excruciatingly grating, monotonous and weak-ass vocal style, one which remains prevalent throughout this album. It doesn't work on the faster sections, but it really doesn't work on the slower parts, where he draws out the lyrics and becomes overly exposed and loud. He also looks towards the completely revolting whispering of the band's excursions into 'the nu', utilising them along with utterly whiny, tuneless and shitty grunge clean vocals over the equally limp and tuneless non-melodies found in the various breaks on this album.\n\nAs mentioned, this album is something of a kitchen sink. On longer songs (a passing glance at the sink) the content is an unholy, bloody awful clusterfuck of ungodly proportions pertaining to length versus actual worthwhile content. Songs will get an idea going, like the 'Battery'-styled acoustic intro to the opener, run with it for the duration of the thrashing portions, then it all breaks down into a crappy groove part and then an even shittier nu 'metal' part, extra squealing and whispering included. The album just cycles like this ad infinitum, ad nauseam, ad otherlatinwords, you get the idea. The album doesn't flow at all, and the fact that only the thrashing parts are worth a damn makes the vast majority of this album equitable to needless filler. Hence the shorter the song (a shorter song being inspecting one fork from the sink), the more consistent a listen, though they are certainly no better. \n\nFor instance, 'Now I Lay Thee Down' is like a really terrible version of '10s' minus the atmosphere of said Pantera song. It is how NOT to do nu 'metal', what with its awful vocals and horrid, grating, tuneless instruments. 'Aesthetics of Hate' gets some good ideas going, it is the only song on here that I can call thrash, but even then Flynnnnn manages to throw that all away in favour of guitar screeching and shitty whispering towards the end of it all, fucking up what could have been a second 'Davidian' for the band. The only thing I can say in this album's favour is that it at least isn't repetitive, finding 2 - 4 different ways to suck per song, which is more than can be said of this band's pre-Empires output. However, the songs are still needlessly overlong, and can have about half of the 'music' cut out to leave a bunch of 3 to 5 minute stock thrashers, which is an infinitely more appealing than this abomination.\n\nDammit, the album doesn't even sound good on the most basic of levels. All the instruments, especially the drums, come across as both very lightweight and loud. The cymbals ring endlessly, the drums are a dull, light 'thud', the guitar sounds completely clean and sterilised, as well as overly trebly, there is surprisingly little low end on the album, and the vocals are audible. All of these are hideous flaws that aren't appropriate for a purported 'thrash metal album'. Fucking Burn My Eyes had better production than this, and that was from 1994. Seriously though, the vocals are too goddamn loud, and the trebly guitars makes the screeching sound even worse.\n\nSo far, I have been viewing this as a thrash metal album. Of course I would, the big ol' hype machine called it such, and the album's most ardent supporters (as a gander at any Youtube comment fight will tell you) insist that this is thrash metal (or 'trassh mettel', given that it is a Youtube comment), but what the hell, let\u2019s look at it as a groove metal album, Burn My Eyes style. Then it is only barely any better, as it runs with 'Davidian' like ideas but still deals with all the screechy crap that this band's debut was loaded with. The actual groove on here is below even the worst of Pantera (well, OK, the second worst, this still isn't 'Good Friends...'), and the songs themselves are so incoherent that it isn't even memorable akin to Pantera. The album doesn't play to groove metal's strengths, that being pure, undiluted anger, and instead tries to be weirdly grandiose. This doesn't work as nu 'metal' or metalcore for the same reasons, because it doesn't even try to be a dumb, knuckledragging stompfest. '(sic)' or Suicide Season this is not. And it sure as hell isn't progressive - jam packing 4 or 5 underdeveloped ideas into an overlong song is not 'progressive' in any way, shape or form. In fact, given how much this adheres to '90s and 2000s orthodoxy, this is the exact opposite of a 'progressive' album.\n\nAnd oh my fucking god is this thing pretentious. The lyrics are utterly meaningless gibberish (apart from 'Aesthetics of Hate') that is nevertheless presented in such an overwrought and pseudo-intellectual manner, one which clashes completely with the retarded vocalisations of Robbbbb and is further exacerbated by the archaic stylings of the cover art, the occasional crapshoot in the realm of 'atmosphere' with the pretentious acoustic parts, and some of the language used on the album. It is bloated, self-important, pompous, arrogant and just fucking punch-worthy in tone. I can't help but feel that Robbbbb really let his ego get to his head this time, since the one instance of a song having some heart and soul poured into it, the one time he was drawn back down to earth by some asshole proverbially pissing on Dimebag's grave, is the best song on the album, as well as the least arrogant and annoying.\n\nAnd you want to know the funniest thing about all of this? This is Machine Head's best album to date. This... thing possesses enough collective musical merit to inch slightly further ahead of this band's abominable debut, the former 'best' of the band. I guess it is a classic therefore, since it shows an old band actually outdoing itself much further down the line, long past their prime. Not often we see that, especially for a band sticking to such overplayed and banal stylistic influences. I mean, at least Flynnnnn doesn't rap on this album! That is a plus, right?!?\n\nBut really, just fucking avoid this. Leave it to rot like the pointless hype piece that it is, there is better shit you can be listening to. Machine Head, what a joke of a band.\n",
        "\nHaha... this is a joke right? Please tell me it is. Else, I have no fucking idea how any level of effort can go into something that fails so fucking hard. It manages to be boring, annoying and unintentionally comical all at once, through its hilariously poor attempts at eclecticism, atmosphere, and aggression. It sounds so utterly terrible and dated that it puts everything else from the decade to shame. Fuck, the '90s sucked for music!\n\nYeah, yeah, that statement is nothing new. And yes, bashing Machine Head's horribly misguided attempts at pandering to the mainstream is nothing new either. However people, history is if nothing else, a lesson. And once in a while, we need refresher courses. We need to be reminded of why the '90s sucked, what made it such a godawful time for any metal band, and what our beloved genre was usurped by. In addition, I felt like bashing one of the consistently terrible mainstream metal bands, and my main gripes lay with this album and its successor. Discussion of this album and ones like it in the present day should be solely to tear it to pieces. So, without anymore rambling bullshit, I present to you all: The Burning Red.\n\nUgh... where the fuck do I begin? How about those FUCKING VOCALS. Robb Flynn is such a shit vocalist, and the various vocal styles he uses here prove why. This album is comprised mostly of an emaciated, toothless shout, akin to Phil Anselmo circa Far Beyond Driven, without any of the edge or aggression of the comparatively amazing Pantera vocalist. Combined with the shitty grunge cleans that call upon a terrible version of John Bush on Stomp 442, the hilariously bad and corny wigger rapping \u00e0 la Fred Durst, and the really, really shitty tuneless whining that calls upon Jonathan Davis, and you have what amounts to FUCKING EAR-RAPE. This is honestly one of the most consistently terrible vocal performances I have ever heard on a professional album, and that includes a variety of screamo abortions that pretend to be aggressive and soulful. It really doesn't help that this motherfucker has had his 'talents' pushed so goddamn high in the mix that there is no escaping his whiny, irritating and tryhard performance.\n\nAnother issue with pushing up a shitty vocal performance is that the instruments beneath them are almost completely drowned out. Actually, scratch that, the backing band for Robb Flynn suck balls. They do pretty much nothing of note, with the guitars managing nothing but a sort of indiscernible drone that apparently was made using guitars (of the bastardised 7-string variety). There are ZERO FUCKING RIFFS on this album. NONE. Nothing pleasantly dated like a chord strum, pretty much no groove riffing, no acoustics, just CHUG CHUG CHUG like 2 dogs having at each other. It is just a muddy, stagnant, heavy but powerless and shitty performance all round. The same goes for the drums and bass, all these fuckers does is keep time and follow the guitars respectively (no funky bass breaks from the latter either, for shame!), allowing their 'efforts' to be mixed into that background mess that apparently are the 'instruments'.\n\nOh, and there are no solos, because one of nu 'metal's most astonishing(ly terrible) core tenets is a seeming revulsion to a solo. Is that because it isn't good for radio play, perhaps? Or is it because none of the hacks that ran these bullshit anti-metal collectives could actually play something that wasn't in time to the fucking chugs of the song? Either way, the only attempt at melody is the piss poor use of screeching from the guitars and the shitty... keyboards? And OF FUCKING COURSE, they are deliberately out of tune and sound like shit, just like everything else on this album, and coupled to Flynn's utterly revolting quiet voice, just makes me want to break my speakers out of sheer agony.\n\nI always ask myself this question as the quiet, tuneless bullshit at the end of 'Desire to Fire' starts - WHY CAN'T FLYNN WRITE A FUCKING SONG?!. Well, not a good one, anyway. Needless to say, much like most things of a stop-start nature, the songwriting and structuring is absolutely fucking terrible. These songs literally go nowhere. They have no real structural intelligence (verse-chorus all the way), with NO FUCKING SOLOS (have I mentioned that yet?), no change-ups in terms of 'riffs' or pace, and an on-off sense of dynamics. The songs are either chugging away, being retarded and dragging their knuckles, or they are all wussy and limp. What both of those have in common is that both states sound terrible, and both fail at what they do. Slow parts aren't atmospheric or sad, and heavy parts sound emaciated and tryhard. The songs don't flow either, with the stop-start 'riffs' having overlong gaps between them, creating a sense of disjointed, rhythmically retarded songs, and the quiet sections coming out of nowhere and raping the listener's ear. Seriously, there is zero build up or cool down between the two dynamic states this album is perpetually locked in, and it makes for one incoherent listen. \n\nFuck this album. I would like to emphasise this point, if you take nothing else from this review: FUCK THIS ALBUM. This is one of the worst things related to metal that has ever been released! It is utterly terrible on all levels. It is a complete pissing away of talent, it is absolutely fucking terrible on a sonic level, the musical concept behind it (rapping, grunge, hardcore and groove metal all in one) is an ungodly aberration, and the artistic principle of hopping on a trend as blatantly shite as nu 'metal' is beyond despicable. This, my friends, is a towering, crumbling, ghastly and overlong ruin, a decaying reminder of why the '90s sucked for metal, why artistic principle is important, and why Machine Head SUCK BALLS.\n\nI can't stress this enough: FUCK. THIS. ALBUM!\n",
        "\nMachine Head's mid era displays just what happens when money from previous efforts becomes toxic to an artist. Though I have heard worse, this is still the pits of rock music and this band's pretty lacklustre discography. It isn't quite as bad as The Burning Red, as this album tends to be more irritating than sickening. Nevertheless, it amounts to the same thing, that being utterly terrible nu 'metal'.\n\nThis essentially takes all of the crap genre clich\u00e9s of nu 'metal' and throws them all into one album. The end result is what can only be described as the lowest rung of a musical movement that is already confined to the sewers of rock music. This is so generic and banal that it is unbelievable. If you have heard any other nu 'metal' work from the years before this one, particularly of the Limp Bizkit variety, you have heard everything this album has to offer.\n\nRobb's work here is so phenomenally poor that I don't know how to react. For instance, take the absolutely shit quiet sections, full of these revolting whispers and crying vocals. I don't care how emotional an artist's music tries to be, there should never be any crying or whispering anywhere in the music, it sounds like garbage. He attempts to rap too, which transcends revolting and just becomes hilarious! He sounds so corny, like a terrible version of Fred Durst (yes, really). I just can't take this album, or any album, seriously when someone raps this badly or sounds this disgusting. It is a parody, it must be. In truth however, Flynn spends far more time doing a weak version of the shout he managed on Burn My Eyes, or standard John Bush styled grunge cleans. As you can imagine, he is at his best here, because in both cases he is aping something considerably better.\n\nAnd don't expect the instruments to be good, either. The instrumentalists never extend themselves in anyway whatsoever. Obviously, there are no solos, because that might put some actual emphasis on someone that isn't the vocalist. Of course, this can be excused if the guitars do that annoying screeching, for some reason. They mostly chug on one chord or two, with the only worthwhile grooves and riffs found at the beginning of 'Bulldozer' and the title track. The bass either follows the guitars or does nothing because I can't hear it at all. The drums mostly do nothing but keep time and meld into background noise with the guitars or do nothing at all. Instruments in rock (or metal) should never be reduced to background noise for the vocalist to... do whatever the hell Robb does on this album.\n\nI think there is actually no songwriting involved, at all. The songs begin with some random sound effect, or stagnant guitar chord repeated an arbitrary amount of times, then the instruments quieten down for whatever auditory torture/comedy Flynn unleashes. This continues, then it all degrades into a crap quiet section, before resuming with the loud bit. The songs just begin and end when they want, and it often feels like 30 - 40 second fumbles on the instruments are stretched to fit around 4 minutes of whatever gibberish Flynn could come up with. There is no progression from an impactful beginning to a satisfying end. I don't expect a full blown progressive masterpiece, but I also don't expect what amount to demo levels of jamming on a professionally released album by seasoned musicians.\n\nMachine Head has always been one to follow the trends (that is why the band exists, after all), and this represents the most blatant example of this. Don't bother with Supercharger, or its predecessor. Much like most albums of this style, there are too many tracks (ranging from 14 to 18). When each song feels like it never ends, and there are at least 12 full songs, it makes for one boring and irritating listen. I have yet to sit through the entire album once, it gets so bad that I need to stop after about 5 tracks to take a break before resuming.\n",
        "\nHave you ever noticed how all Machine Head albums are stereotypes? Everyone knows what they think of each before they even listen to it: it seems pointless even to consider what the band have done on individual songs, because some stylistic shift or choice of bandmembers has occurred since the previous release. This means that 'Through the Ashes of Empires' is the \"comeback\" album, as in the album that changed the style back to the groove/heavy/thrash weight of the first two MH full-lengths. Now, for pure quality, I don't think MH have ever quite topped their debut (not if we're talking about consistent quality anyway), though they have had parts of albums or specific songs that rise above that level, especially on 'The Blackening'. This \"comeback\" album doesn't come awfully close to 'Burn My Eyes', but it does strive to be more ambitious and creative, which would reach its ultimate conclusion on 'The Blackening', with its longer songs and detailed themes. Thus, we end up with a nice effort that won't be to everyone's taste.\n\nThe best thing about this album from the point of view of a MH fan, or any fan of modern metal for that matter, is that the band didn't dick about when it came to riffs, they brought plenty of solos back in, and they didn't merely make a regressionist album, but took their formula forwards a good few years. For an album that was released during the first throes of metalcore and the NWOAHM, this packs a modern punch - just listen to the breakdown in 'Imperium' for evidence that this was more groundbreaking than retreading ground. However, this certainly doesn't choose to sit alongside Killswitch Engage or Shadows Fall. The guitars, while still downtuned, have a much heavier tone than 'Supercharger' and sound grittily alive and earthy; the bass rumbles and chokes just as brutally, all of which muffles the drums just a little, even though the performance is pretty accurate and skilfull. Some of those riffs now hit very hard and fast, with added complexity in some parts. The best songs for this element are probably 'Imperium', 'Vim', and 'All Falls Down', which are mostly quick, though also sound massive. 'Bite the Bullet' also has some monster riffs, though the technique of slowing down for the vocal lines makes it a little difficult to adapt to the constant changes, even if the heavy parts hit even harder as a result.\n\nThe disappointing thing when listening to 'Through the Ashes of Empires' is that the quality is inconsistent. If the band can come up with a song like 'Imperium' - which has generally been judged the standout on this album and one of the band's best - surely they could have spent a little more time on 'Elegy' or 'Left Unfinished', which just sort of happen and then end, without any particular end result. I'm not being mean, but 'Elegy' is the kind of song that a band might write in their first few rehearsals and either discard or significantly alter it later, taking the worthwhile parts and moving on with them. One groove riff and a forgettable chorus won't cut it, fellas. 'Left Unfinished' has had more thought and time, although this one ends up sounding ugly, with jarring riffs and a vocal harmony that matches horribly (i.e. does not match). Maybe it's supposed to sound like that because of the difficult subject matter, but I still don't like it and I don't imagine many others will either.\n\nSomething that the band did gain from their flirtation with nu metal was the ability to alter their tempo more and give Robb Flynn some time to sing clean. He's not an amazing singer, but he has a lot of variation in a song like 'Days Turn Blue to Grey', which can be tender one moment, furious the next, and strangely contemplative a moment later. His harsh vocals are still rather ragged and unfinished, though I can imagine that this aspect appeals for some people who can hear emotion or struggle in his voice: it doesn't do it for me, so the variety is welcome, as well as the moments when the band move at speed beneath him, which make his rough voice better. Again, I\u2019m left to wonder - should Machine Head employ a singer? But whatever. Sometimes the effort that he puts in sounds majestic, such as on the closing \u2018Descend the Shades of Night\u2019, when his passion rises above his drawbacks and crafts a truly memorable and inspiring chorus. He writes surprisingly touching and eloquent lyrics too, which also deserve a better outlet.\n\n\u2018Through the Ashes of Empires\u2019 remains an important MH album because of the way it stuck the band right into the midst of the contemporary development of the genre. This is purer than metalcore in a lot of ways and updates a lot of the classic features to create something that is truly significant to the 21st century. I\u2019d put Machine Head ahead of popular bands like Killswitch Engage and Slipknot, who - despite being popular - haven\u2019t managed to unite the tribes so much as these guys. A good album, all told.\n",
        "\nMachine Head are back again after their epic 2011 release Unto The Locust with a brand new highly anticipated album Bloodstone & Diamonds which has a lot to live up to because since The Blackening, Machine Head have been on a ladder that only goes up with each release topping their previous and this album is no different. Bringing new things to the plate while still keeping it Machine Head. \n\nFirst up is the monstrous and epic 7 minute long Now We Die. This song is structured amazingly well with nothing becoming repetitive. A variety of instruments such as violins and other harmonies are used in the perfect places with Robb Flynn's roaring vocals searing over the top of them. With huge choruses that lead to unbelievable bass drops and solos this song has it all and it's only the first song. Things get keep getting better when the next song Killers & Kings starts. Shorter, faster and harder. Dave McClain shows off on the drums with a technical and fast song with subtle uses of certain cymbals and flares on the double bass. Now I am not normally a fan of breakdowns, I find that they hurt the flow of a song but Killers & Kings unleashes a thunderous breakdown about halfway through that doesn\u2019t ruin the song but compliments it. \n\nSail Into the Black and Damage Inside are both much darker and slower songs, showcasing Robb Flynn's ability to come across as softer and sad. Sail Into the Black is the longest song on the album but doesn\u2019t really give you that impression. The first 3 minutes of the song is softer and mesmerizing, the use of acoustic guitar and subtle piano is what creates that sort of dreamy atmosphere. On the flip side though there are songs that are quite aggressive in true Machine Head fashion. Songs like Game Over and Night of Long Knives have grinding riffs with fast solos and have strong and aggressive lyrics, which makes the song sound very angry. \n\nJared MacEachern, the new bass player, is settling in so well it's like he has been in the band for years, he even had an input on the music for the song Ghosts Will Haunt My Bones. His bass playing is excellent with none of it being drowned out by any other instrument. Listening to the sort of news room style interview on Imaginal Cells it really does bring to light some interesting facts and questions, it is an interesting idea which I like. And what better way to finish off the album than leading it to Take Me Through The Fire a hard hitting song that has memorable choruses and brilliant riffs that close out one of the best albums of 2014. \n\nOne small problem with this album is that some songs are a little long and repetitive, songs like Eyes of the Dead and Beneath the Silt are impressive songs but could be shorter and still get the same point across. All in all there isn't anything that is unbelievably exceptional or different from their previous 2 albums, however it is definitely Machine Head in all its splendour. This is without a doubt a diamond among the rough and would highly recommend it.\n",
        "\nWhen reviewing an album that you know is bad or that most people hate, you tend to be influenced one way or the other by its uncelebrated status. Some reviewers will give it a beating just because they know they can, even if they actually don\u2019t mind it, while others will stand in its defence even at the cost of reason. Contrariness is part of human nature. I\u2019ve come to realise that I have slightly that problem when I face a Machine Head album, since I don\u2019t detest the band in the least, but I\u2019m forced not to like them too much by the comments of others. My review of \u2018The Burning Red\u2019 doesn\u2019t really come down to whether the album is of musical merit, because I gave \u2018Supercharger\u2019 an awful score and have since realised that I enjoy it more than this one, which is plain in many places and does appear to be an attempt at writing commercial metal.\n\nThat said, the formula that dictates how \u2018The Burning Red\u2019 progresses isn\u2019t bad in itself, and it seems that the reviewers on the Metal Archives have more of an issue with the nu metal genre and commercial leanings in general, rather than specifically on this release. The songs hold together much better than the fragmented \u2018Supercharger\u2019 and are even more focused than the somewhat experimental \u2018The More Things Change\u2019, though I find few of them exciting or unpredictable. To be honest, this isn\u2019t a typical nu metal album, with too much melody, speed, and aggression to fit the genre, despite the small amount of rapping (it\u2019s annoying, and seems too deliberate to be legitimate) and the low and sludgy guitar tone. In fact, it sounds rather like one might expect the solution to the Machine Head + Ross Robinson equation would sound, with a simplification of the band\u2019s already simplified groove thrash formula, the absence of solos, and quasi-atmospheric guitar parts.\n\nAround half the songs here transform Machine Head\u2019s previous sound into a new arena, while the other half actually break new ground for the band, with more guitar effects, simpler rhythms, and the same funk and rap influences that had entered the metal consciousness in 1999. Probably the most obvious of those nu metal songs are \u2018Desire to Fire\u2019 and \u2018From this Day\u2019, the latter of which I think has one of the best choruses on the album and a certain ballsy swagger to it, even if Robb Flynn\u2019s rapping could use some work. Then there are songs like \u2018The Blood, the Sweat, the Tears\u2019, that might have fitted onto \u2018The More Things Change\u2019 if the production was changed and the guitars brought back. What definitely happens on this album, though, is that the energy remains high for the majority of the experience and Flynn actually gives his strongest vocal performance on any Machine Head album, which is weird, since he isn\u2019t singing lyrics anywhere near as interesting as he did before or after.\n\nThe problems come when one starts to examine the musicianship on this album, which doesn\u2019t amount to a great deal. Nu metal was always a simpler kind of music than most other types of metal (why doesn\u2019t drone doom get this shit?), but the riffs on \u2018The Burning Red\u2019 don\u2019t do a lot for me, having neither enough crunch or bounce to satisfy the 14 year old Korn fan still inside me, and nothing like the complexity of their other material. \u2018I Defy\u2019 maybe gets the nod for riff of the album, because it has more nuance than some of the others, yet it is also the angriest and one of the fastest numbers, which works strongly in its favour. Adam Duce does more work on this album than most of Machine Head\u2019s others, since the guitars are not always the focal point: his work is gravelly and moody, satisfying more than one might expect, while Dave McClain is way more profficient than David Silveria or Abe Cunningham (from Korn and Deftones respectively).\n\nAs such, my feelings about \u2018The Burning Red\u2019 are really rather mixed. I don\u2019t have anything very bad to say about the album, except that it isn\u2019t consistently interesting and the band aren\u2019t playing to their full potential, but this isn\u2019t the pile of steaming faeces that many would have you believe. \u2018Supercharger\u2019 represented a further dip in quality, though a slight resurfacing of the band\u2019s ability to be creative, and falls short of this from an objective standpoint. If you want to hear some aggressive nu metal done fairly well, you could choose a lot worse than this.\n",
        "\nWhen this album came out, metal fans were mostly split into two groups: those who decided it was time to draw the line and never listen to Machine Head ever again, and those who shat their pants in excitement. I was 15 years old at the time and probably had to throw away that pair of trousers for good. For 15 year old me, this was one of my very favourite albums and I thought that the material offered on here was easily Machine Head's finest, perhaps the finest in all my collection. Now, I'm not so sure: I don't listen to Machine Head too often, they don't excite me in the way they used to, this album gets an average number of listens. Plus, I don't soil my pants anymore. (Disclaimer: I did not shit myself when I was 15, I was well trained.)\n\nNevertheless, this should be the best Machine Head album, because the level of ability on show is phenomenal, though I think the whole thing doesn't come together as well as it appears. Now, I don't believe that MH are a thrash band and I don't really bother about genre distinctions when I choose what to listen to, so my sole focus is on whether the music is good. What I do notice now is that the music on 'The Blackening' is probably the purest heavy metal (I mean that it's taking cues from traditional bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden) on any of their albums, maybe tying with 'Burn My Eyes' on that front. In fact, to compare MH and Metallica side by side, what conclusions would you draw about 'The Blackening' and 'Death Magnetic'? And which album, with its long songs, kind-of-progressive-kind-of-not structures, and modern-sounding semi-thrash riffs came first? Anyway, we do get a lot of classic features resurfacing in MH's sound, notably solos, melodies, inventive bass lines, even a little twin guitar here and there. There's also more of a thrash influence, though it remains just an influence and not as large a one as some people would have you believe. We are definitely in the realm of modern metal; not necessarily groove metal, which does appear, but also metalcore and that kind of non-specific subgenre that I would put Devildriver in.\n\nThe album sounds...good. There are some good riffs on each song, which I must say don't always carry the whole way through the track (the unwieldy opener and closer) or are used with too much repetition, such as on 'Slanderous', which rides just a couple of riffs for five minutes and relies on the impact of that admittedly raging groove riff just one too many times. There are a couple of riffs that you might pick out as thrash, like the first riff on 'Clenching the Fists of Dissent' or that motherfucker on 'Aesthetics of Hate'. They might be thrashy if they were played in a thrashy style, but with the low tuning of the guitar and more modern drumming patterns, they end up a little wide of that target and no worse for it. There are a couple of riffs like the verse riff of 'Beautiful Mourning' that just stink, yet then many of the slower parts pick up a lot of power from the tone and modern style that allows simple ideas to sound impressively big. Some real surprises emerge: 'Halo''s chorus is a revolving melody that fits wonderfully into its intricate solo; 'Wolves' has a riff after the second chorus that uses every string on the guitar and fits the song perfectly; the solos on almost every song are absolute belters and are wanting in no respect, whether that be skill, planning, or excitement.\n\nThis album is about the guitarists and I can't help but think that a different drumming style would endear MH more to the purists, since Dave McClain does fill up a fair bit of the sound with a fairly average performance. He is so busy, trying all sorts of different beats and fills, that in the end it seems a shame that nothing really sticks or enhances the performance. Actually, the drums are too weak for the production of this album, so that they have very little impact beyond modulating the tempo of the songs. Adam Duce is certainly not anywhere near the front of the action, but his bass shines through at certain moments (the chorus of 'Now I Lay Thee Down' being a good example) and shows a level of invention that perhaps needs more exposure. I don't want to say a great deal about Robb Flynn's vocals, though this may suffice - what if MH got themselves a lead singer and let Flynn concentrate on guitar? His voice doesn't sound great during either his cleans or his shouts, and he's too gruff to give an album like this the finesse that it deserves.\n\n15 year old me wasn't wrong particularly - this is an album worth paying attention to. However, part of me now wishes that MH would re-record it without an eye on the commercial market, since there are too many disparate elements to fit comfortably in some of the songs. Three of them are simply too long, while sometimes the level of inventiveness suddenly drops off and there is a stinking riff or vocal to fuck up the atmosphere, which is one thing that 'Burn My Eyes' didn't have - that was generally more consistent in style. If Machine Head could write a song like two thirds of 'Wolves' or like the first half of 'Aesthetics of Hate' or like the solo in 'Halo', then maybe found a singer who could match the standards of the musicianship, they would be almighty. The problem is that - for a band with such outstanding ability and potential - they fail to carry their vision to its goal.\n",
        "\nIt seems as though Machine Head have carved themselves a nice little niche style-wise in the third chapter of their existence, after they quit making nu metal albums and decided to go back to pushing the boundaries of groove metal. They did so by co-opting theatrical grandiosity and operatic themes while adding more melodeath, thrash, and metalcore into their repertoire of riffs, grooves, and rhythms. This was light at first on Ashes of Empires, peaked in intensity with The Blackening, and fully matured into this style with Unto the Locust. Judging by the music on this album, they're content to stay with the Locust style as it keeps their possibilities for songwriting wide open and potential for scale nice and big. This album of itself is the logical consequence of Unto the Locust, a big, loud, epic, grandiose, third world war atmosphere towards the album. It brings the high sung, operatic choruses, big song lengths, and theatrical atmospherics such as cellos and violins with thick and heavy distortion pedal effects for the guitars. Being big and overblown is Machine Head's game now, and it's a game they play skillfully, It's no Blackening, and It's no Locust, but they still deliver the power in metric ton after metric ton.\n\nOut of the songs on this album, they seem to serve two purposes, either as atmospheric pieces, or as big powerful battle anthems for the next world war. \n\nThe more atmospheric songs are also some of this albums bigger strengths, they overwhelm you and gives off a feeling of enveloping darkness and an uneasy calm, best exemplified on Damage Inside and Sail into the Black, giving the feeling of being trapped in a dark brig contemplating how you ended up there. Imaginal cells is another atmospheric piece with the only vocals being snippets of a speech on paranoid apocalyptic predictions of future war, disaster, and rebellion with a trudging riff to accent the conflict heavy atmosphere. They even do their best Meshuggah impression on Beneath the Silt, but thankfully this song isn't some trendy djent piece, but rather an atmospheric sludge piece with distorted acoustics and vocals that gives off a feeling of being drenched in said silt and dragged down a slow river in a dank, dead swampland.\n\nThe massive battle epics are the other side of this album; especially with the first two songs, Now We Die and Killers and Kings run on high energy, charging riffs and big loud choruses. Songs like Game Over, Ghosts Will Haunt my Bones, and Take me Through the Fire tend to be chorus driven and while decent sounding, they have very cheesy sounding lines and choruses that spoil the mood. However, this isn't an omnipresent problem as more ear-catching and groovy riffs with a lack of cheese choruses appear in songs like the terrifying piece Night of Long Knives, and the hard groover Eyes of the Dead. Special hardline war-like atmosphere is created and blended with the battle charges in the song In Comes the Flood with it's political lyrics which offer a sound reminiscent of what rebel soldiers would listen to while storming Washington DC in the heat of battle. On Bloodstone and Diamonds, the war theater is the first thing the listener sees in their mind.\n\nAs an individual album, this stands high and mighty all by itself though it does fall somewhat short of Locust and The Blackening. It suffers quite some bit from length problems, as these songs would be much more bearable with lengths of about 2/3 what they are. We don't need all of this padding just to make this album feel \"epic\" the atmosphere of the songs themselves does that. Some of the cheesier choruses could also be ironed out and given a reworking as something rougher and less awkward. With those removed, I'm certain this would be an album on par with Unto the Locust. However, If you love this band, you have patience, and want to go straight to the war theater, into the chaos, this is your album! See you on the front lines, soldier!\n",
        "\n1994 was a desperate year for heavy metal from fighting back the American alt-rock scene. Machine Head\u2019s debut classic \u2018Burn My Eyes\u2019 was a needed call to arms. That album forced heavy metal to rise up and fight back the constant onslaught of grunge. Throughout Machine Head\u2019s earlier years they went through turbulent times with consistent lineup changes, albums of varying strengths and record label issues; however Robb Flynn\u2019s vision of his band forever stayed true. In 2007 the reward came with the universally accepted \u2018The Blackening\u2019 which was hearkened a modern classic of thrash and groove metal. \u2018Unto The Locust\u2019, 2011, was a strong effort however it divided opinion in that \u2018The Blackening\u2019 manifestly did not. Three years since \u2018Unto The Locust\u2019, Machine Head still are going through a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Four string and founding member, Adam Duce, leaves the band, they move to Nuclear Blast Records and most importantly \u2018Bloodstone & Diamonds\u2019 comes off the back of two of the most impressive metal albums released in the past 10 years. No pressure then\u2026\n\nSince The Blackening Machine Head have explored their ability to produce longer songs, often incorporating different instruments and spoken word passages. Their second single, Now We Die, opens with a climatic string assembly and continue behind 7 minutes of a thunderous mid-paced groove with drummer Dave McClain never missing a beat. Yippee Ki Yay mother fucker. Experimentation is found in other long lasting burners throughout the album in tracks such as the sinister Sail Into The Black. Within this elegy is a breeze of hushed repetition, simplistic piano and subtle acoustic guitars followed by a storm of throbbing riffs and distant crashes that add to the dynamic texture of the song. \n\nThere is still a sense of familiarity in this record however. Killers And Kings keeps to the typical thrash side of Machine Head that we all love. Viciously fast, harsh vocals, pounding breakdown and a menacing solo: What more can you ask for? Game Over also is reminiscent of the anger Robb\u2019s lyrics instill, \u2018For as long as you\u2019re alive I\u2019ll curse your worthless name\u2019, as well as the best introductory song to new bassist \u2018Jared MacEachern\u2019.\n\nGenerally there is nothing about Bloodstone & Diamonds that is remarkably different from its predecessors however it does step up the game\u2026 This is mainly due to the gargantuan choruses evident in Beneath The Silt, juxtaposing the elements of heavy and light music, and standout track Night of Long Knives. This song incorporates everything Machine Head are best at: the pummelling riffs, masterful dual harmonies, Dimebag solos and a chorus that hasn\u2019t been as big since the epic: \u2018Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast\u2019.\n\nThrough every guitar squeal, grunting growl and rolling bass lines Machine Head have once again proved themselves the be one of the most infectiously loved mainstream metal band in the world. It makes you wonder just how they can possibly better themselves.\n",
        "\nMachine Head, throughout the years have been infamously regarded for their moderate tempo accompanying groovy/slammy riffs that have been criticized by many as something along the lines of watered-down thrash. well these kind of riffs were in their prime with this album. However, its not an entire groove-fest from back to front. There are multiple examples of thrash-like progressions and one or two tracks dedicated entirely to thrash such as \"Blood for Blood\" that are very noticeable throughout, welcoming all the cynics and fans from the 80s thrash scene with open arms. \n\nIn my opinion, this album never really achieved the recognition it deserved although some of the 80's thrash loyalists that were so oppressive of this style which controversially dominated the metal scenes at least for the most part in the early 90's would show no hesitation in arguing otherwise. This is really everything you could ask for from a metal album, or at least certainly for the time period it was released in. This is for no other reason than the production of the album that was raw and unpolished with little effort put into that was key for creating such a dark, depressive atmosphere which was, dare I say somewhat reminiscent of many thrash and death metal albums made in the 80's and 90s. \n\nThe production had the perfect correlation with Rob Flynn's likewise doomy, depressive vocal approach that made him so unique especially when compared to the likes of other vocalists of the early 90s period. In terms of vocal range, this was undoubtedly Rob Flynn's weakest album. He had yet to experiment with harsher, and more melodic styled vocals that tested, and for the most part was in monotone waters. On the odd occasion that he did test himself with other techniques, they sounded forced, tired and defeated. However, that was the beauty of them. If Rob Flynn were to somehow go back in time now to the recording of this album, to replace these drained, frustrated attempt at vocals with his evolved clean, pitch perfect vocals, this album would lose its intensity and aggression. The atmosphere would have changed drastically for the worst. \n\nIn addition to this, there are many classic Machine Head tracks from here such as the likes of \"None but My Own\" and \"Death Church\" that each possess their own unique elements of progression and darkness, yet are somehow overshadowed by later material from the band's discography almost to the point that it would seem they've undeservedly been erased from existence. \n\nHowever on occasion some of the forgotten gems from this album are granted a place on the live setlist. Every band has \"that album\" that you immediately think of when the band's name is mentioned. For Machine Head, its none other than their debut album. With this release, we witness Machine Head at their darkest, rawest and arguably their most progressive. On other releases, whether its been for the better or the worst, Machine Head have revised the style of this album, only to expand and evolve on it. \n\nFavourite tracks: Old, None but My Own, Death Church, Block\n",
        "\nI'll just jump right in. This is just one of those albums that will always be written off as a mishap in the band's career, amongst the likes of Megadeth's \"Risk\", Metallica's \"Load\", Slayer's \"Diabolus in Musica\", Morbid Angel's \"Illud Divinum Insanus\", Sepultura's \"Roots\", for many reasons. \n\nAny trace of originality had been exchanged for a potential shot at mainstream rock station exposure that the band would be granted with, had they converted to the nu metal way of life like they did with this album. Their unique aggressive tendency to fuse slammy/groovy riffs with all-out thrash attacks had been exchanged for instrumentals that were more commercially acceptable at the time which revolved around the same three riffs over a moderate tempo drum beat, infamously designed to make the crowd jump up and down on the spot. \n\nThe only redeemable quality from this unfortunate release (which you had to dig pretty deep for) would come from the song, \"Five\". The lyrics really don't do much although the whole party metal vibe had been dropped and the album became briefly moderately reminiscent of the band's early-mid nineties style. Heck, even that's a bit generous but I'll feel bad otherwise as Machine Head are actually among my favourite bands and this compilation of trendy nausea came as such a nasty shock and a waste of hard earned money. From now when I see an album's release date from a band I like, that was around the time of 1997-2002 when the likes of Limp Bizkit and Korn had their say, then I will always hesitate, maybe even refrain from buying it. This album made me aware to behave in such a manner towards releases from that particular time period.\n\nThe lyrical themes really remind of some generic rock band replicating Nickelback who are making a desperate attempt to get noticed by commercially reigning pop rock labels. These lyrical themes contain the likes of being juvenile and getting drunk, you know the kind of lyrical topics that arguably laid the foundations for future mishaps of rock music such as Nickelback to make their wretched breakthrough into the mainstream as they, among many other simpleton bands would latch onto the style.\n",
        "\nSo this album spelled disaster right from the off for this band. This being due to the fact that it literally couldn't have been released at a worse possible time. The fact that Machine Head's previous release had pretty much eradicated the majority of their fuming fanbase after surrendering all originality in exchange for radio play to the infamous wave of nu Metal that was picking up speed fast and laying waste to potential bands with talent (Soulfly, Machine Head) and even some of the metal greats (Sepultura, Slayer), not to mention the fact that the band released a single from this album under the name \"Crashing Around You\" literally hours before the 9/11 attacks. Furthermore the turnout from concerts that would follow soon after to support this album were so low as everyone was still in a state of shock from recent events at the time. It was safe to say everything had gone tits up for the band. \n\nFirst off, the lyrics were pretty much everything you'd expect from a cliche nu metal (or at least a nu metal-influenced) album. Not to say that there's never a large lyrical variety on the typical nu metal album because that would be a lie. However more so that Machine Head were obedient with the sub genre's typical percentage of lyrical content. The album's lyrical content roughly consisting of 70% beating up morons in high school after years of tolerating their antics. 10% angst, 10% most likely being words picked out of a hat that don't really make the slightest bit of sense but seem suitable for the instrumentals, and 10% more angst. \n\nHowever, as a guitarist myself, I've always been one to overlook the lyrical content of a band, possessing more of an interest for the instrumentals (primarily in terms of riffs) that albums have in store. And as much as I, not necessarily detest Nu Metal as a whole but certainly don't approve of the style and its tendency to absorb and convert metal bands with originality, I have to say I was totally won over by the instrumentals, somewhat against my will. The \"jumpy\" styled riffs that the likes of Korn had pioneered back then were irresistibly catchy but that was because Machine Head weren't completely replicating Korn's style as so many other bands were doing back then, but more so taking Korn's style and completely revolutionising it and making it their own. And its a shame the album didn't receive more recognition because of this. \n\nAn example of this would be how they took the infamous \"jumping up and down on the spot\" kind of riffs and incorporated it with elements of groove and thrash. It was pretty diverse even for a nu Metal release. It's also worse noting that there was even the occasional guitar solo thrown in here and there which would have angered any record label at the time as it was the total opposite of the nu metal way which was bringing in the dough at the time. \n\nIn conclusion, if you are a die hard fan of everything the band had released up to this point INCLUDING The Burning Red then you'll almost certainly be satisfied by what this album contains as in my opinion this is actually a major improvement from The Burning Red.\n",
        "\nI always find that this album is mysteriously overlooked and even forgotten from Machine Head's discography, even by the band themselves who rarely play any material with the occasional exception of the opening track. This album also seems to be unfortunately made an outcast even among some of the huge fans, despite it containing elements from Machine Head's releases (excluding those albums from their infamous nu metal phase). Some examples of this would be the progressions from The Blackening that eventually result in a total thrash assault, The clean vocals which were becoming more common as the years progressed which they would finish where they left off with from this album, once again with later albums. \n\nRight from the start, the band had a mountain to climb if they were going to top the 90's metal masterpiece, \"Burn My Eyes,\" which did a fascinating job of adding a signature sound to the groove metal genre alongside Pantera's contributions. In my opinion this album does a great job of adopting Pantera's jumpy, groovy way of riff that would eventually become the sound on the street in the world of metal for all radio stations in the early to mid 90s. \n\nThe year in which this album was made was 1997, and in my opinion Rob Flynn's peak in his career in the vocal department. It was just a couple of years before his foolish decision to sacrifice his unique, very original approach to vocals for the mind numbingly obnoxious sounding \"rapping\" which plagued their next couple of releases in years to come. With this album he explored a large vocal range and would experiment with it in more or less every song here, whether it was the harsh screeches that would occasionally spawn in \"Take My Scars\" and \"Struck A Nerve\" or the thrash metal styled ramblings that were in their element over songs with random fast tempo outbreaks. A fine example being towards the end of \"Violate\". \n\nIn terms of technicality and song structures, the band were more or less sticking relatively close to the same formula as Burn my Eyes. As noted before, the addition in terms of fast tempos and thrash elements were the only slightly unfamiliar aspect of this album. The only feature of this album I'd honestly favour over their debut would be the production. As if Burn My Eyes wasn't raw enough already, this album expands on that unclean, unpolished 80s metal styled production to the point where it almost creates a rather atmospheric vibe to it. \n\nAdmittedly, the riffs can be a little simplistic here and there. The most notable example being the opening track, \"Ten Ton Hammer\" which revolves around the same two riffs for the most part, kind of hinting at their exploration in trendy metal that would eventually follow. Despite this, its still undeniably enjoyable. The two riffs combine to make an aggressive, head-banger of a track. In conclusion, as long you're open to their new thrash like and also atmospheric approach to the infamous sub genre of groove metal, \n\nFavourite tracks: Take My Scars, Struck A Nerve, Spine, Bay of Pigs.\n",
        "\nI came across this band through the most unlikely source after hearing the song \"Ten Ton Hammer\" on MTV of all places. Intrigued by the band's slammy/groovy style, I was determined to pursue the band, and fortunately enough for me, \"The Blackening\" would have been my next obstacle from this band. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this modern metal gem was a gateway album for me, although this album undoubtedly opened my mind to the heavier stuff associated with thrash metal and death metal, I usually view \"gateway\" metal bands to be associated with the infamous styles of metalcore and nu metal genres in the way that you can never really go back to listening to those styles of music after listening to more extreme sub-genres of metal. \n\nHowever the beauty of this album is that unlike metalcore and nu metal, this album is still very much listenable after you have discovered those more slightly extreme styles. I remember hearing that main riff to the song, \"Halo\" back when I was in high school and just completely loving the shit out of it. It, like many other songs on this album have yet to decay even remotely. \n\nI think the main feature of this album that makes it such a gem would be the regular crossovers in time signatures. Most people criticise this album and write it off as \"a failed attempt at thrash metal\" (or something along the lines of that) which I always see as a rather narrow-minded statement as one of the main characteristics of groove metal since the early 90's has been its whenever necessary changes in tempo. The most notable examples of this lie within the tracks, \"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\" and \"Aesthetics of Hate\". \n\nOne thing also worth crediting this album for, which judging by the other reviews would be a rather infamous view, is the way that the song writing/song structures are very unpredictable and unique. A shining example of this would be \"Beautiful Mourning\", which after a somewhat eerie intro, shortly explodes into an all out thrash attack, however with many melodic and progressive elements to accompany it. \n\nOne other thing worth noting about this album is how, as ferocious and enjoyable as \"Burn My Eyes\" and \"The More Things Change...\" were, its safe to say that you really only needed your index finger to play the rhythm parts in most cases for both albums. And we are all too familiar with Rob and co's idiotic decision to crossover into nu metal waters towards the end of the 90's which limited their technical boundaries more than ever. However \"The Blackening\" saw a complete revolution in the band's technicality what with an increase of aspects such as dual solos, and also the backing vocals that they had been mildly experiment edwith in Through the Ashes of Empires.\n",
        "\nSo this record was pretty much continuing where they left off from their second album, \"The More Things Change...\" except with a far less raw production. One of the only minor differences being certain changes in the vocal department. With this release, Rob Flynn chose to adapt to, dare I say a more metalcore inspired approach as the style was rapidly ascending to the mainstream, although he did this whilst still managing to combine it with his own original style. \n\nThis was also the band's first album with the presence of former Vio-Lence guitarist, Phil Demmel who you'd thought would have been responsible for the band's surge into melodic metal territory that wouldn't have been nearly as evident on any release before. This time around, the band also seemed far more technically advanced compared to other albums, which might not be much of an achievement considering the two albums before had been attempts to break into nu metal-infested mainstream waters. The solos were much longer and there were even cases of dual guitar solos which would have been a big ask for the band for when they first started out. \n\nMy only real complaint about this album which I can't simply bring myself to overlook would have to be the lyrics. The nu metal-styled ramblings which conspired with the predictable instrumentals of \"The Burning Red\" and \"Supercharger\" are the only elements that survived the stylistic shift. Unfortunately Rob Flynn's influence fell victim to Phil Anselmo's laughable tough guy demeanour that chose to degrade metal within 1992 that is mysteriously adored by many modern metal acts to this day. An example of this would be from \"Seasons Wither\":\n\n\"I'm gonna see you bleeding\nface down in the dirt, \nI'm gonna give you back what\nyou've taken with hurt, you coward,\nI'm gonna spit right into your face, \nin grace you'll be now more.\"\n\nApart from this piss poor lack of creativity vocal wise, I wouldn't see how any fans of the first two albums, who felt betrayed by what was the follow wouldn't be able to forgive the band for this album. A re-emergence of the controversial groove-infested riffs that are so frowned upon by thrash loyalists, but at the same time managed to build such a solid following, are noticeable right from the start to finish.\n",
        "\nI was never a fan of Machine Head, and this just gives me another reason not to become one. To be honest I think that its rating at the time of writing (38%) is more than fair, and in fact seems a bit generous. This album is just a classic example of what's wrong with most nu-metal acts, and hence why the genre has slowly died off since the turn of the century.\n\nI'm sure that there are many, many people that love a good bit of Limp Bizkit or Korn, but that's not what most metalheads expect when they're given an album by a semi-respected band. Groove metal has always bordered close to nu-metal, but there comes a point where you've got to admit that you've stepped over the line. That's what's happened here, and it isn't a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe fact that the band's main appeal seems to be awful chords that just sound painful and breakdowns that are like some kind of cold sore pretty much shows what you're in for (a bad time). Basically they both just keep on coming back and they never get any better, but since this is a nu-metal album that's the most innovative thing that they could implement here without losing interest from the few people that would still listen to this. Never mind the fact that it would be more enjoyable for everyone else, the minority are important here. You know, \"Fuck mainstream shit,\" and all that.\n\nThere's a very Limp Bizkit-esque tone about a lot of the stuff produced on The Burning Red, and I'm sure that you'll be put off by that. I don't know who wouldn't. The long and the short of it is that the riffs either chug along or make needlessly loud screeching noises. Wherever possible, the band combine the two of them. Then mix screams and shouts that don't have any worth with shitty raps that detract more than they add and hey-presto, you've got a clone of the world's most hated band. You will, however, be pleased to know that the vocals tend to sound more akin to Corey Taylor of Slipknot than Fred Durst. Hooray.\n\nI'm extremely embarrassed to admit though that the song Nothing Left kind of left a positive feeling behind. I don't know whether that's just because everything else was so bad that it seems good in comparison or if the breakdowns in the chorus would normally be appealing, but for one reason or another it seemed at least okay. I didn't get as much of a headache listening to that song as I did for the rest of the album anyway.\n\nIt would seem that the only reason Machine Head ever released an album in this style is because it was the successful genre at the time of release. And thank fuck that it isn't anymore, because then we'd have to tolerate bands like this one churning out crap that will be bought because it's the cool thing to be into. There will forever be a special place in my heart for this album as it manages to be worse than many nu-metal acts that I don't look upon in a good light (Papa Roach, Slipknot and Mushroomhead to name but a few).\n",
        "\nEvery time I think of this album, I am completely averse to it. Yet every time I listen to it, I find it enjoyable for the most part. I think my problem is that the first time I heard it I just remembered the ugly intro to 'The Frontlines' and I was weirded out. The More Things Change... isn't as noticeably thrash-influenced as Burn My Eyes, but nor does it touch upon the nu metal tendencies that would follow on the next 2 albums: there are a few songs that sound like a concrete Exodus, notably 'Bay of Pigs' and 'Blistering', though my attention is drawn to the slower, creeping tempos on 'Violate' and 'Down to None' that are unusual for groove metal in having a guitar tone and air of menace that is actually doomy.\n\nMaybe that's why I don't mind this album - it's the only Machine Head album that has atmosphere. It doesn't have atmosphere in the way that a Candlemass or Burzum album has atmosphere, but the production and attitude have a definable quality to them that I will call dirtiness. That snorting bass sounds like a pig rolling around in the mud and comes clear through the mix, having many moments in which it dominates. That takes the attention away from the drums, which don't do a lot to stand out despite a solid performance, mired in mediocre fills and standard patterns as they are. The guitars are odd even for this type of music, because they sound much better at a crushing pace, though Machine Head do play fast. This means that the riffs groove heavily and in a good way a lot of the time, since there are some of the slower riffs on 'Ten Ton Hammer' and 'Down to None' that ooze power and have no need to speed up. There are some more generic grooves thrown in, like the chorus of 'Bay of Pigs', but the solos totally surprise, sounding almost '70s in tone.\n\nThis reason why this groove metal album works is Robb Flynn's voice, which is not normally what I would say about Machine Head's output. There is something darker and less direct about the way he sings on The More Things Change... that makes the whole thing more complex and intriguing. There are a few less convincing moments, like the clean chorus of 'Take My Scars', but there is no predictability to be seen, nothing seems forced, and the songs' messages are less overt and more sensed through the atmosphere. This album seems to come rinsed of the positivity and fighting spirit that other MH releases (especially post-Supercharger) have been saturated with, while the \"city in crisis\" theme of Burn My Eyes is not pushed so relentlessly and allows the songs to breathe on their own. In addition to a soaring twist on his usually rough bark, Flynn sings softly and menacingly on 'Violate', which has an intro that - excessive length aside - really shouldn't work, yet is almost justified by the nuance in its delivery. Coupled with the oblique and melancholic guitar parts (the middle section of 'Spine', for example) that don't appear on any other MH album, these vocals give the album enough atmosphere to mark it out clearly - it sounds old and distant in the way that the cover image suggests.\n\nAll of the songs on The More Things Change... are discernible from one another, which is a good start from the band's point of view. There is character in each composition - which MH have occasionally neglected to include - and diversity in the mixture of styles and tempos that the band have combined into their signature style. There is pure heaviness and ability in 'Blistering', catchiness in 'Ten Ton Hammer', menace in 'Violate', and 'Blood of the Zodiac' almost has an ethereal quality that I would say is the defining trait of this album. There are weaker moments and poor choices, but no song is completely dispensable, making this one of Machine Head's best efforts and an enjoyable listen.\n",
        "\nLet's be honest, Machine Head took a dive soon after releasing their first album, heading down a path of increasing grooviness and nu metal trend hopping, which culminated in a god awful polka dot hair dye and 2 stinkers in the form of The Burning Red and Supercharger. The band certainly had the right idea at first though, since Burn My Eyes was not only a great album, but the band picked 'Old' as the single. 'Old' was probably the best song on the debut to silence the naysayers, since it is the thrashiest and riffiest cut, 'Blood for Blood' notwithstanding.\n\nThe introduction is bass heavy with that ominous voice over - \"1994: corruption, racism, hate...the church has failed...Jesus came down - and he shot\" to set up the religious theme, before the riffs smash down. The first one is not bad, but the second is off the handle, making the groove subsidiary to the thrash and sounding huge as a result, especially that deeper catcall at its end. The chorus pushes through Robb Flynn's held notes and circles back to the first riff on the cry of \"Jesus wept!\" The build up after the second chorus is a little off the boil and indicates the territories the band would be heading towards, though the song ends on a strong note. The only thing missing is a solo.\n\n'Old' isn't Machine Head's signature song by any means, but it's one of the most formidable songs they have written and deserves its place - both revered and maligned - in the book of heavy metal history.\n",
        "\nOne thing I remember about this album in regards to its release is the controversy it succeeded in causing amongst many Machine Head loyalists who were admittedly hoping for a repeat of \"The Blackening\". Unlike other releases from this band, the opinions were very split, with a large portion of the band's fan base viewing this album as the perfect follow up to the masterpiece that was, \"The Blackening\". On the other hand, the slight departure from the groove metal genre left many other fans rather disappointed. However, time has only proved on many occasions that sticking to the same musical formula can eventually become repetitive and just flat out boring. In my opinion, the more melodic-thrash like approach that Machine Head had taken with this album was a great alternative to their previous 90's groove style. \n\nThe standout track on this album is easily the part title track, \"Locust\". Its safe to say that this is probably the only track on the album that rein acts their old, groove-oriented style while still managing to maintain the more melodic approach that they were obviously going for. It is a track that meets pretty much every requirement in order to achieve a modern metal masterpiece, such as constant changes in time signatures and melodic crossovers that just fitted in so well. \n\nThe really great thing about this album is how each track is so incredibly unique in its own way. I honestly see this as Machine Head's most experimental, creative release to date, and not just because of Robb Flynn's infamous decision to feature a kid's choir in the final track. There were so many other unique features to this album that were rather uncharacteristic for Machine Head, such as harmonic backing vocals in the all out thrash attack, \"This Is the End\" and eerie acoustic intros that would progress into a doomy distortion fest with \"Darkness Within\". \n\nI suppose the only thing preventing this album from a higher rating were times when the band tried to be as aggressive as possible with the instrumentals and as a result it seemed like Robb was having a hard time keeping up with his vocals that didn't seem to have much of a correlation with the instrumentals. However even this was a rather rare fault. \n\nIn conclusion, I can't exactly guarantee that this album would appeal to an audience who are crazy about albums such as \"The Blackening\" as well as earlier releases, as with the exception of the title track, the band had migrated from their signature sound.\n",
        "\nMy first impressions to the release of this album, being the huge fan I am of this band and some of the masterpieces they have graced us with through the years was, \"Wow usually this band leaves at least a four year gap between each release nowadays but this time around they're in the studio just two years after the 2011 release? they must have a lot of new ideas, right? We must be in for a real treat!\" Well think again. \n\nMy primary complaint about this album is just how everything seems so incredibly forced, especially the instrumentals. A rather accurate summary of nearly all the rhythm sections on this album would be how often we get the sound of a rather washed up thrash metal band who have are completely lacking in. The solos on the other hand were one of the only redeemable qualities of this album.\n\nThere's a very unfortunate absence to this album of many unique aspects that Machine Head once possessed. The most notable absence would have to be the headbanger friendly groove oriented riffs of which gained Machine Head such a loyal following that haven't really been present since \"The Blackening\". Well let me tell you now that there is not a single track on this album that would even qualify for the \"maybe pile\" on \"The Blackening\" or many other previous Machine Head releases for that matter. \n\nThere were a couple of standout tracks on this album that prevented this album from a lower rating, a fine example of this would be \"Ghosts Will Haunt My Bones\" which had some pretty sweet harmonic vocals that accompanied some of the only memorable riffs that this album had to offer, creating a pretty cool, dark atmosphere. Then there was the majority that was totally forgettable, then on the other hand you had some complete catastrophes, one of these catastrophes being, \"Sail into Black\" which was total and utter filler. I'm not sure if that's what Robb Flynn and co. consider to be \"progressive\" nowadays but it was a song that lead to absolutely nowhere and was horribly misplaced even for this album's low standards. It dragged on for an extremely unnecessary length that would have one reaching for a pistol. \n\nAnother track on this album worth complaining about would be \"In Comes the Flood\" which is basically a song about the new world order and further proof of how everything on this album just seems to be so instrumentally forced. I get the impression that the band were so set out on trying to \"wake up\" the American population through lyrics, that they almost forgot that they're supposed to actually convert their paranoia into music, so once again we have very rushed, half-assed instrumentals to accompany a conspiracy rambling. All in all this comes off to me as yet another filler track. \n\nAs far as this album goes, you'd have to be a die-hard fan of groove metal and the acts that the genre had to offer such as Chimaira or Soulfly to get a kick out of this. If you were like me, hoping for \"The Blackening\" part 2. Then you might be in for an unpleasant shock.\n",
        "\nI have been a Machine Head for quite some years and I really dig their early stuff (\"Burn My Eyes\") as well as their later works (\"The Blackening\"), so naturally I have been following them with anticipation during this time. Back in 2011 when they dropped \"Unto The Locust\", I was really torn between my opinions of it. It wasn't on par with \"The Blackening\" at all, being rather weak in comparison. However, it wasn't a bad album either. After that album I started looking forward to their next album, thinking \"maybe next time around\". Well, now I am here with the result in my hands, but not quite an answer. See, this is, just like its predecessor, a very mixed bag of tunes, only that there are almost the double amount of tunes this time around.\n\nEarlier this year we got introduced to the first sign of this album: the first single \"Killers & Kings\". I didn't really think much of it at the time, but maybe I wasn't into the groove metal mode either. More recently we were introduced to the opening track \"Now We Die\". At first I felt a little disappointed, but it quickly grew and it's really a decent track, even though not their best opening tracks judged by their last two or three albums. \"Killers & Kings\" really grew (quickly) as well, and I really find it one of the more exciting tracks on the album, as well as a very thrashy one. While listening to the album I start to really get this feeling that it's a heavily thrash-oriented album. Certainly more so than their previous efforts. As the album pounds on this gets even more obvious with tracks like \"Night Of The Long Knives\" and \"Eyes Of The Dead\". \"Ghosts Will Haunt My Bones \" feels like a second part of \"Be Still And Know\" from the previous album, but not quite as interesting. Still quite early on in my listening process, Machine Head does something extraordinary and refreshing - they do \"Sail Into The Black\". That is really the most interesting track of the bunch here, with a lengthy dark, almost gothic, calm intro before it just slams away in pondering double bass groove rhythms. There's something truly haunting about this song and I couldn't stop listening to it afterwards.\n\nThe album continues its crusade for the bloodstone and diamonds, but halfway through it really loses its pace drastically. It's like the album was really promising as something strong, and then just bang! - it loses all its energy and interest. The first point where this is evident is \"Beneath The Slit\", the album's worst track to my ears. It's got a cool doom-y riff, but it's too down-tuned making it sound like lousy nu-metal. I truly hate nu-metal (including MH's own middle-era albums). Robb Flynn's vocals really doesn't make anything better about it either, singing in a very Deftones influenced way. After this my ears just seem to be beyond saving for the rest of the album, and so they shall obviously not be.\n\nAfter the blasphemy called \"Beneath The Slit\", Bloodstone & Diamonds really just becomes an utter bore-fest for the remainder of the album. \"Damage Inside\" proves to be quite the light in the dark among these tracks, but with its mere three minutes of length, it's barely able to save the experience. When the last track \"Take Me Through The Fire\" is over, I'm sighing and feeling disappointed, this time around again. I'm really left with a feeling that I expected more from this, but what really bugs me is that the album started off so strong and promising, just to end up only a decent bag of treats. Ultimately I still think it's for the better that this album has twelve tracks instead of seven, as \"Unto The Locust\" did. Because of this we can pick out the best six or seven, and make it an album like its predecessor, but with even stronger tunes. But in reality, this album is more than that, it's six good ones and six bad to mediocre ones. Too bad, really.\n\nThe album's mixing duties were handled by good ole' Colin Richardson who did \"Burn My Eyes\" back in the early days, as well as many other masterpieces from the 90's. Andy Sneap also worked with the mixing stages of this album. Here we have two appreciated metal producers, and while the album certainly sounds huge and heavy, I can't understand why everyone of these \"professionals\" (still) make albums that compressed (a.k.a. \"brick-walled\"). Like always with metal these days, digital clipping is present and no dynamic range is to found whatsoever. At the end of the day I also find myself wishing the album was rawer and \"dirtier\". I truly miss the hardcore groove sound and live-feeling of their first two albums with every new Machine Head album released since \"The Blackening\". Machine Head simply do not sound dangerous anymore.\n\nThis album is a mixed experience. I cannot really recommend it to metal fans except for the die-hard fans of the band itself. If you are interested in checking out the album, then I would suggest listening to the first six tracks on Spotify and ditch the rest. Make a playlist of the first six, possibly accompanied with \"Game Over\" and \"Damage Inside\", but no more. With that, you can have a good new Machine Head album. With the whole album you will always have only a decent one.\n",
        "\nI used to love Machine Head. I worshipped at the altar of Robb Flynn in my late teens and in retrospect I can see that MH were a gateway band for me. I'd already obsessed over Slayer and Pantera and needed more of this heavy, extreme stuff. Machine Head weren't heavier or more extreme, but were heavily influenced by both those bands while still having a style of their own and on this album, one massive weapon-amazing songs.\n\nMachine Head never topped this debut. I call it Guns N Roses syndrome-an amazing debut where the band expends all or most of its songwriting ability and spends the rest of their career trying to live up to the hype...and fails. People say 'The Blackening' tops this, Metal Hammer even gave it album of the decade. What a load of bollocks! 'The Blackening', like most of MH's material, is a decent album that is guilty of the worst trend-hopping, no more, no less. Even 'Burn My Eyes' was riding the groove-thrash wave that Pantera took mainstream, but at least this album is packed with quality song after quality song. \n\nAny metal fan who hasn't heard 'Davidian' obviously isn't doing it right. An iconic song, a great opener and that immortal battle cry of 'Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast' make this an instant classic. 'Old' is another song that should be familiar to fans of the genre, another classic song and mainstay of the live set. I could go on but the next 7 songs are all utterly brilliant slices of groove/thrash metal, fueled by a passionate frontman. Flynn ruled back in 94, a powerful barking of angry lyrics without any of the 'progressive' pretensions of modern MH. Behind Flynn, a very capable band delivering solid performances on guitars, bass and drums. Modern Machine Head goes for fancy guitar solos, harmonies and a more progressive take on the MH sound. This album is much more primitive and all the better for it. On this album the solos are a better fit and the trade offs between Flynn and Mader are excellent. \n\nThe only fault I have with this album is at the very end. 'Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies' is ultimately pointless but maybe would've worked as an outro. As it is, the album ends with 'Block' a poorly written song with 'Fuck it All' shouted approximately every 6 seconds and crappy verses. A shame really because the opening 9 songs are absolute beasts, from 'Davidian' to the slow, crushing 'Death Church', the almost-ballad 'A Nation on Fire' and the blistering 'Blood For Blood'. I'd probably rate it 95 if it wasn't for the last 2 tracks.\n\nAll in all, this album amazed me when i was 18 and it's still a monster of an album now. Great riffs and solos, powerful drumming, top quality songs and lyrics written and delivered with passion. If only the band had continued down this road.\n\nSince I originally wrote this review I've actually got back into Machine Head and tried their newer material. It's good, there are some excellent songs on the last few albums but nothing will ever compare to the might of Burn my Eyes. This album simply slays and as such I've increased my original score thanks to my renewed appreciation of this classic.\n\nRecommended: Davidian, A Thousand Lies, Death Church, A Nation on Fire, I'm Your God Now....actually the first 9 tracks as a whole.\n",
        "\nI love how people paint Machine Head's transition into the mallcore found on The Burning Red and Supercharger as an instantaneous thing, where they went from flawless groove metal to complete shit overnight. While Robb's vocals turned mallcore overnight, as did the band's sense of aesthetics, and the change of guitarist notwithstanding, it's pretty clear here what Machine Head were gunning for in their career future. While there are some more respectable songs on here, such as the surprisingly (given the context of the rest of the songs) energetic Bay of Pigs, or the ambitious offerings of Violate, the majority of this album seems to meander around with muddy riffs and snail's pace drumming, with the first few songs coming off as an obvious omen to where Machine Head were heading. We have more clean vocals, which I have no problem with, but they're often paired with soggy, lazy riffing playing nauseatingly contemporary (at the time) music. Flynn's gruff shout from Burn My Eyes is still here in full, and prevents one of the singles, Ten Ton Hammer, from being a complete waste of time, and we have a few faster sections in some songs, but I get a strong lazy vibe coming from this.\n\nPart of the blame must go to the riff sewage we hear a lot of. I'm talking about stupid 0-1-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-1-0-0- riffing with sloth-like drumming behind it. I hear a few glimmers of McClain's talent here, but this whole thing sounds restrained as fuck, a huge waste in every sense of the word. I also don't know how Logan Mader, as well, managed to lose his ability to move a song forward with the guitars. The guitars drag everything down with their sluggish pace, and then cut out occasionally to expose the repetitive bass grooves, and then come back in with an unrelated idea. While Burn My Eyes had its share of riffs here and there, we are riff starved here, with aural excrement passing off as guitar riffage, and even when those aforementioned faster sections come, by then the songs are starved of momentum for the most part, and this makes the more uptempo parts seem even more out-of-place, often due to their randomness and brevity, much like the little dingleberries that turn a fart into a shart. You may notice all the references I've been making to poop and waste, and that's because the production literally sounds like shit. Not shit-ty, but literally like a trip to the waste water treatment facility. It sounds like amorphous brown gunk with few riffs rising above the (brown) water.\n\nThis album suffers not because its inherently shitty, but rather because it doesn't know what it wants to do, and ends up wandering around aimlessly like the driver is asleep at the wheel. The Burning Red, as horribly trend-whoring as it was, knew what it wanted to do. The More Things Change... does not. This album can't decide if it wants to be aggressive groove metal or limp-wristed mallcore, so it comes off sounding like limp-wristed groove metal. It's not mallcore, and gets a lot of points for simply not being a huge amalgam of cliche's, but it's not much better. Like I said, there are moments of genius scattered around this mess, and Robb's reliable workmanlike vocals get the aggression across when the guitars and drums can (don't even get me started on that murky rumbling disguising as bass guitar) but overall this album is a mess from beginning to end. This is not Machine Head's best moment, nor its worst, but it is a clear omen of bad times to come. \n\nAnd it also reeks of the 90's in the same way \"Nothin' For A Good Time\" by Poison reeks of the 80's. Any negative connotations the reader would infer from that statement are probably correct.\n",
        "\nI had been curious about Machine Head's \"nu\" phase for quite some time, in the same vein as the morbid curiosity I get from hearing about a triple homicide in the paper. I had heard that it was terrible, but what I found was not so much talentless as rotten trendwhoring. While I'm not a fan of Machine Head in any sense, regarding their best work as ranging from \"ok\" to \"enjoyable\", but this is beyond the pale. In case anybody was wondering, what the Head have done here is replace their old guitarist (y'know, the one who actually wrote riffs instead of chugging) and replaced him with a numetaller and then made an album with, I shit you not, every single nu-metal cliche' there ever was. Listening this immediately transported me back to middle school, even though I never actually heard any of this back then, but only due to how derivative the songs are. \n\nThe disc starts off with a serious case of jumpdafuckup, with chugging I could play with a dildo instead of a pick. While high on barbiturates. We then get treated to a few rhyming lines, done in a grumpy whisper that was all the rage in the late 90's, as popularized by bands like Korn. I don't believe this song has anything, though, that I'd call an actual riff, and there are maybe 3 chord patterns at best. The vocals range from rapping (which I find ironically enough to be the most tolerable vocal style Robb uses on The Burning Red) to that numetal shout that was popularized by seemingly every band from Papa Roach to Disturbed to The Deftones. By the time this album is a few songs in, we're wading breast-high in numetal cliche's. I swear, it's like Robb compiled a list of EVERY cliche' done by a numetal band circa 1999, when this was made, and compiled it into a full length album. If you liked Robb's vocals on Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change you will be disappointed because his style is completely unrecognizable, replaced by this amorphous nu metal whine. The lyrics range from douchebaggy to whiny, and the whispering and pseudo-crying really gets on my nerves every time I have to hear it. \n\nDon't expect the instruments to be any better; McClain is clearly capable of better drumming than this, as he sticks to basic 4x4 patterns and it becomes difficult to believe he was in a respectable metal band a couple years prior. That, perhaps, personifies why I find this so morbidly fascinating, in that it's a metal band that went from respectable post-thrashers to complete nu metal drek lickety split. Another way of visualizing the change is watching the live videos around that time; bassist Adam Duce looks completely out of place, with his thrasher style completely at odds with the nu-hipster look of the rest of the band. And this also symbolizes exactly what is so wrong about The Burning Red -- it's fake. It's manufactured. It's not what Robb and co. really were as a band, and it's them trying to be a mainstream band. \n\nAnother issue I take is with the song \"Five\". Many people have commended Robb on his bravery in coming out about his abuse... but I'm not sure if these people can remember back to the late 90's/early 00's when numetal was all the rage, and whining about child abuse was common. Not that I don't have empathy for Robb, but it seems quite disingenuous that he waited until numetal was popular, and thus it was relatively trendy to write lyrics about child abuse, to do so. Almost smacks me of being opportunistic, it seems. Either way, the delivery and the whole trendiness of the way this song is presented reduces the impact the lyrics would have had on me, if the song was worth a damn to begin with, which it isn't. \n\nBottom line is that if you came of age at the time of or before numetal was popular, and thus were subjected to the relentless jumpdafuckup, then you have already heard this album. Every riff, every groove, you've heard it before, and there's nothing original at all about The Burning Red. While the next album was a bit more tolerable because they toned down the horrid Limp Bizkit influence, the Ahrue Luster period of Machine Head will live on in infamy as where they traded their original sound for a straight-faced mockery of an already shitty and creatively devoid style. 3 points for Robb's rapping, which was surprisingly decent and the least annoying part of his performance, and 2 more for Duce's involvement, which was the closest to preserving their integrity the band got to during this period. Avoid at all costs, if that's not blatantly obvious already.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, the defining factor of how much I like the songs on this album is defined in the intro, because they're all absolute trash. The intro to almost every single song is either droning, high-pitched and/or incredibly boring, though the music that comes after the intro is spectacular.\n\nThe bass work in this album is intense and groovy and gives the music on this album an edge over their two latest studio albums, which lack that important component. All of the instrumentation is tied down together with the bass to create a very headbangable and entertaining musical ride. The entire album is full of memorable tracks that, when boosted with an amazing sound system, will blast a crater into your neighborhood. One track that has an extremely crushing main riff is Ten Ton Hammer; the track gives us listeners a taste of the whole album.\n\nRob's vocals are the good old thrash shout they've always been and in this album you see the improvement from the first, and with a close listen you can really hear the influence of early-mid '90s vocalists like Jonathan Davis (Korn) and Corey Taylor (Slipknot, Stone Sour). Speaking of Korn, there's a riff that has come straight out of the nu metal king's repertoire, but I'll leave that for you to find. \n\nThe overall sound of the album is a nice 50/50 mix of groove and thrash. Some tracks are cataclysmic in the amount of aggression in the instrumentation and vocals, whereas some songs/passages show just how well Machine Head can compose music with an extreme emphasis on groove. Like I said earlier, the intros are complete and utterly terrible, and almost every track has a ridiculously boring and stretched out intro that is painful to the ears, but the music you find after the intro is definitely worth the wait.\n\nI would and have recommended this album to a lot of friends and I recommend giving it a listen and sharing it with your mates.\n",
        "\nI used to love Machine Head. Burn my Eyes is still a great album despite my tastes moving on a long way in the years since 'Davidian' first blew my mind. Some people say The Blackening tops their debut. What a load of bollocks! I seem to remember this not only getting various album of the year awards, but even getting named album of the decade by one rag. Must've been a slow decade for new albums in the 2000's. Suffice to say, i don't like this album and i sold it a while ago.\n\nAdmittedly this starts off with an absolutely huge thrash attack in 'Clenching the Fists of Dissent'. The riffs come thick and fast on this one while Flynn spouts off about war and politics etc. Some of his better lyrics but that isn't saying much. Nice guitar solos and a kind of cheesy chanting part suitable for the live setting. It's a long song but mostly it's a very good one. Speaking of long songs, this album is dominated by them. Great if you can write like Opeth or Dream Theater but unfortunately for Robb Flynn he can't write good long songs very often.\n\n'Beautiful Mourning' starts with Flynn yelling 'Fuck You All' and this is the exact moment where you know it's business as usual for MH, all fake tough guy bullshit from here on. Dull song too. 'Aesthetics of Hate' continues with this formula. While the lyrics are a noble attempt at attacking some guy who insulted the then-recently deceased Dimebag Darrell, to be honest i just got sick of Flynn doing the same long rant before playing this song live EVERY SINGLE TIME! The song has some awesome lead guitar in it but has a boring, lengthy ending and yet more annoying tough guy lyrics. \n\nOf the other 5 songs, all i really remember is 'Slanderous' has terrible lyrics even by MH standards, 'Now I Lay Thee Down' is a dreadful semi ballad, and 'Halo' is an overlong widdly guitar fest with bad lyrics and too many trademark MH guitar pinches. The last 2 tracks are so dull and long that i can't really remember much about them other than that i hated them. Musically speaking, the band probably play better on this album than on any before it, particularly the lead guitar work, but this counts for very little when the songs are so bad.\n\nSo that's an excellent opening song, a few nice guitar solos and harmonies all mixed in among plenty of riffs ranging from very good to plain and boring. It's also yet another trendy genre hop by Robb Flynn to semi-thrash when that revival kicked in. This is better than the 2 nu-metal albums they did in terms of musicality but at least those much maligned albums had memorable (memorably bad) songs. This is just boring and overrated.\n\nListen to 'Clenching the Fists of Dissent' and maybe 'Halo'. Avoid the rest like the plague!\n",
        "\nGiven the wild success and rapid growth and maturation with The Blackening it seems it would be hard for Machine Head to stay atop this mountain they scaled with that album. Most people would say they put all of their energy into that one release and that it couldn't be matched. Well I'm here to tell you that's wrong. Unto The Locust for the most part measures up to The Blackening. It seems Machine Head have finally found a sound they can stick with and improve on. They really seemed to try and step up their game on this one.\n\nEverything has been pushed up to even more grandiose heights than with The Blackening. The use of melodies and thrashing as opposed to chugs is increased beyond anything they've done prior. The riffs and songwriting have gotten more epic and virtuosic. The band has trained more with their instruments and Robb with his voice. Lyrically, themes of inevitable mortality, questionable morality, and the various crises that everyone must face and question show up often in this album, replacing the older themes of respect and toughness with something more mature. In fact this whole album just feels like the most intelligent album they've ever released.\n\nUnto The Locust kicks off with the monumental I Am Hell, a brutal charger that starts off with angelic Latin chanting that sets the atmosphere of glory continued on Be Still And Know. They descend off that high note into a raging inferno with the heavy hitter, Locust. They finally descend further into and emerge triumphantly out of the impressively operatic sounding Darkness Within. These songs constitute the very best of what this album has to offer and for a while had me believing that this would trounce The Blackening simply with it's sheer grandiosity.\n\nLater on in the album, it starts to lose it's luster. Pearl Before The Swine is alright but is rather flat with less dynamics with the same rumbling riff playing in the background for most of the song. Who We Are ends the album on an unfortunately sour note starting with the weird, creepy sounds of children in an elementary school chorus singing off key into the song. Lyrics that bring less to mind Machine Head and more to mind Shinedown are sung here. Seriously, the lyrics remind me of Shinedown's \"Bully,\" which was an extremely mediocre song. Who We Are also manages to sound absurdly poppy with it's harmonized chorus and \"uplifting\" feel that just isn't as strong here as it is on the other, less cheesy songs. It's a stupid conclusion to an otherwise great album, thankfully it's at the end.\n\nUnto The Locust is overall a nice album, except for the last song. It's one of the stronger entries in Machine Head's catalog, but does not outdo the Blackening on terms of their respective strengths and weaknesses. With more strong tracks it could have easily beaten out The Blackening as their best effort if not for the lackluster ending track. Unto The Locust is still a memorable piece that will easily please fans of late-era Machine Head. I could easily recommend this to you if you were on the lookout for this or wanted to introduce someone else to either Machine Head or Metal music in general.\n",
        "\nMachine Head certainly felt they had some redemption to pull off. They went on pretty much an overhaul of their entire previous sound. Through The Ashes Of Empires had a solid, if lyrically immature foundation to build upon and expand with. The Blackening is a blistering example of what happens when a band goes all out with their style and pushes it to it's very limits. This album is the point where the infantile sounds of Through The Ashes Of Empires grow to fit the big boy pants and mature into the monstrous juggernaut it was meant to be.\n\nThe sound of The Blackening is built on solid mixtures of riffs with a strong progressive slant and mixed vocal delivery. The mixed vocals actually come out very well on this album as the clean singing is just as effective as dealing the songs' messages out as Flynn's usual bark. Robb's clean singing has finally caught up as it was terrible on The Burning Red and Supercharger, decent but patchy on Through The Ashes Of Empires, and finally consistently good on The Blackening. The lyrics of this album have regained a lot of lost intelligence and maturity and focus more on societal, philosophical, and inner struggles. There is some remaining tough-guy attitude here, but enough to actually seem tough, not corny. The instrumental playing, finally is pushed to much more complex levels as the guitars alternate between weighty groove riffs, energetic thrash charges, and soaring, operatic melodies to get across the emotion and meaning of The Blackening's songs. \n\nA grand, almost imperial start to the album is put forth with Clenching The Fists Of Dissent. This song is a protest anthem set to grandiose proportions with a quiet intro of acoustic guitars giving way to a martial introduction of the lead guitar ended by a crashing riff that leads us into a powerful charge. Robb leads the rally and lets out an all out attack on guitars building tension slowly and later shredding like a madman across the song giving way to a crescendo point int the middle of the song where chants are made to fight build still more tension before finally climaxing. This song has all the makings of a superior intro and gives a good impression of the rest of the album.\n\nA barrage of riffage, soaring melodies and Robb's improved clean singing make many of the songs into brilliant pieces of metallic gold. It progresses through different emotions and attitudes all throughout with each and every song having more content and drive to it than the last. other masterful moments on The Blackening include the soaring melodies of Beautiful Mourning; the insidious, twisting riffs of Aesthetics Of Hate, the gnarly shredding of Slanderous and Wolves. Flaming aggression and beautiful rhythms are combined in an almost operatic style on many of these tracks.\n\nNow I Lay Thee Down has the operatic feel most prominently as sorrowful yet crushing riffs are played with Flynn providing an atmosphere of undiluted passion, sorrow, and later, fury. Halo is a towering monolith of a song with a mashing riff to boot and an almost story like beginning, middle, and end. Finally, A Farewell To Arms wraps the album up on a stellar note providing an offer of solid impending doom after emotionally building on a low starting note and coming down on us like the apocalypse and emanating so much sorrow and anger that it climaxes and ends in a firestorm as an outlet for so much tension and emotion leading us out of this album.\n\nMachine Head really managed to blow me away with this one. They matured and exploded forward into a masterwork of their own style. this album is brilliantly well done and manages to excite and move at every turn. The Blackening is definitely one I would recommend to anyone looking to get into metal and is a must have for anyone who is either a fan of or interested in Machine Head.\n",
        "\nWell, they actually managed to recover from the utter wastes of time and brain cells that were The Burning Red and Supercharger. Machine Head have decided to show us that they still have a lot of creativity left in them by reverting back to their early/mid 90's sound and making some important changes to their line-up. The firing of nu-metaller Ahrue Luster did a lot to reduce the presence of nu-metallish and modern rock elements that were sterilizing and emasculating Machine Head's sound. Robb Flynn's ex-bandmate and ex-Vio-Lence member Phil Demmel's addition to the band did a lot to reinsert the thrash undertones of Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change... and help Through The Ashes Of Empires to actually have a credible sound to it. Having ditched the idea of doing nu-metal all together has the band actually sounding like themselves again.\n\nMachine Head apparently added more complexity in the songwriting and structures and put somewhat more emphasis on riffage this time around. The soaring, charging, riff-fest \"Imperium\" which is definitely the highlight of the album is certainly enough to shut up naysayers and win new fans over. Other songs such as \"Seasons Wither,\" \"All Falls Down,\" \"Wipe The Tears,\" and \"Descend The Shades Of Night\" have similar epic feels to them; well structured, intelligent songwriting; and crushing groove riffs interlaced with melodies that help to further create the desolate, destructive landscape Machine Head wants you to imagine. These songs are shining examples of the best this album has to offer.\n\nThe other songs don't fare so well unfortunately and are mostly a mixed bag. \"Elegy\" and \"Days Turn From Blue To Gray\" are okay, the former being a nice, punchy, headbanger, and the other being an emotional semi-ballad. Some songs would be great if they didn't have a few leftover nu-metal-isms. \"Bite The Bullet's\" softer parts are marred by Korn-ish vocals that spoil the mood. \"Left Unfinished\" deals with Robb basically giving a giant \"fuck you\" to his birth parents. This concept and it's lyrical focus derails the song's solid riffs and leaves it feeling shallow and immature. Many of the rest of the songs are flat chug-fests that raise no eyebrows and deserve no congratulation and are perfectly skip-worthy.\n\nThrough The Ashes Of Empires, while certainly a huge improvement over the joke-ass albums The Burning Red and Supercharger, is not a truly special album and it has several lackluster songs that about equal the number of great songs. The production and tuning are far better and have crushing density to leave you headbanging wildly throughout the better songs on here and cheering them on. Even so, this album doesn't measure up to their 90's groove material or The Blackening and Unto The Locust due to the fact that only a few songs were given most of the attention and they sort of winged it on the rest and only wanted to shake the stained legacy of their two earlier mulligan albums. In this haste they churned out an album that could only be described as \"good.\" Nothing special, specific, or definitive; Just good. Recommended to fans of the band or just their late term material.\n",
        "\nIt seems that Robb and his buddies decided to ride the nu metal gravy train until it crashed. This album is the second of Machine Head's unfortunate mulligans and it emerged out of the septic swamps of the metal landscape in the early 00's. Supercharger is an unfortunate product of it's time and woefully dated. It's cliched to hell and painful to listen to. It seems as though they're trying to mimic the sound of nu metal just to sell records and gave absolutely no fucks about the content of this album. If you thought The Burning Red was cliche and stupid, you ain't seen nothing yet.\n\nThe overall sound of the album is disjointed and aborted. The simple riffs of The Burning Red are dumbed down even more to the point where you can hardly recognize the rhythm. The tuning is flat and the lead guitar and bass are indistinguishable and put much lower in the mix than Robb's atrocious vocals. Even lower, is the drums. McClain's drumming is unbelievably simple, light and lacks any crack or punch and gets lost in-between the guitars. Robb's vocals; finally, are the worst part of the album with off-kilter rapping with little flow or content, whining and shrill singing that stings your ears like nails on a chalkboard and at times sounds like crying, nu metal distortion effects and whispering that just screams \"CLICHE!\", castrated, nonsensical yelling that often comes out of nowhere and often doesn't follow any rhythm. It seems instrument-wise that they were trying to make an album so full of nu metal's flaws and cliches that it would create some singularity that would destroy their own genre. It sounds like a bad joke, like a deranged conspiracy. Unfortunately, it's not. This album was serious and it had nothing to hide.\n\nThe songs themselves suffer from structural problems. Most of the titles are stupid taglines and pop hooks with lyrics that revolve around either tough-guy posturing, teenage complaining, and emo-ish whining. Come on Robb! I know you can write smarter lyrics than this watered down shit! The tag lines are annoying and just thinking about them leaves me feeling embarrassed. The songs are structured in one-riff or two-riff patterns that leave the songs feeling either flat and boring or disjointed and impossible to follow. The few songs that do have any dynamics are usually the ballads which feature the unbearable whine vocals. The worst offenders with this insufferable squeal are \"Crashing Around You,\" which is possibly the worst Machine Head song ever made; \"Nausea,\" and \"Only The Names.\" \"American High\" even has this stupid George Of The Jungle yell at the start of it that only manages to reinforce it's idiotic lyrical content about Robb being a dick in high school. \"Bulldozer,\" \"Kick You When You're Down,\" and \"White-Knuckle Blackout\" are just tough-guy posing with a lot of slathered yelling with some soft vocals just to break things up. The rest of the songs aren't even worth mentioning. The one listenable song, \"Deafening Silence\" actually manages to build up emotion and atmosphere for the first three fourths of the song before crashing into an oh-so-emo climax of crying vocals and whiny rasps. This pisses me off even more since they had ONE good song going for them only to fuck it up at the ending! These songs are thoroughly forgettable, terrible, bland, and annoying.\n\nAll and all, Supercharger is anything but super. The incessant annoyances and boring cliches drag this album down to new lows which Have yet to ever be touched again and hopefully never will be. All I can say is, thank god that they ditched the nu metal sound after this abortion of an abominable turd-stain of an album! This was one of the worst metal releases I have had the displeasure of ever hearing! This was also from one of my favorite bands too, so that only pours salt into the wound. The only way I could possibly recommend this abomination to anyone is if they are an incessant, die-hard, fan of Machine Head just looking to complete their discography, but even then I'd say to pretend Supercharger never existed. It'll save you a lot of torment to just ignore this one.\n",
        "\nHere we are, the very album that soiled Machine Head's reputation and credibility with metalheads everywhere. The Burning Red marks Machine Head's transition from a solid groove/post-thrash metal band into a full fledged nu metal band. Most of us who liked their earlier releases will definitely be put off by this embarrassment of an album. Machine Head to this day still says that The Burning Red was all about \"experimentation\" or \"diversity\" instead of selling out. Yeah right, they're becoming more \"diverse\" and \"not selling out\" by jumping on the goddamned nu metal bandwagon while it was making more money than ever!? Sorry boys, I'm not buying it.\n\nThe Burning Red has much simpler instrumentation on it and much less intelligence or maturity. The guitars are much more simplified in their approach. They consist largely of simple chugging riffs that a first year guitar student could master, lacking the thrashy intensity or grooving punch that earlier albums had. The production is also tinnier and lighter. It's much less bass-heavy and lacks much strength or heaviness. Robb's vocals also suffer as his signature bark sounds castrated, weak, and annoying. His clean vocals also got a lot whinier as he seems to almost squeal when he tries to sing in a melodic manner. His emotional intensity and machismo have mostly disappeared with whiny stupidity taking it's place. He even raps on many songs, which he is not doing well at all. His flow is stunted and his subject matter sucks. I mean, he's rapping about how great he and his band are and how they're living the high life. That's pathetic, just pathetic. While not as awful as Limp Bizkit or Trapt, this album is still unbelievably bad.\n\nThe album doesn't even start off like you think a Machine Head album would start off like. It starts off like you'd imagine your typical Limp Bizkit album. A simpleton groove starting us off with some HUHs and YEAHs followed by Korn-ish whispering gets us rolling into the album as Robb spits forth some self-ingratiating rap occasionally interlaced with some weakened growling. He even has stupid little taglines for his songs that are trying as hard as possible to be catchy or poppy, The worst offenders being Desire To Fire, The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears, and I Defy. When Robb's rapping stops, the songs usually devolve into muddy droll that consists mostly of him trying to sound emotional and melodic, or him yelling as loudly as possible over the riffs without any regard to beat or rhythm. The pseudo-ballad Silver, along with Exhale The Vile, and Devil With The King's Card are glaring examples of this. The rest of the album is pretty much a mixture of several types of crappy, typical, nu metal cliches. The only exception is the absolutely abominable cover of Message In A Bottle by The Police. The idea of making a metal cover of such a sunny, relaxed song is terrible enough, but combine that with Robb's whining and shouting, and it becomes unbearable! These songs are garbage.\n\nIf whining, yelling, and full-of-yourself rapping are you're thing, give The Burning Red a spin. As for everyone else, stay away, far away. If you like Machine Head's earlier work or prefer their post-Supercharger material, avoid this. You will be disappointed. If you don't like Machine Head, The Burning Red will only give you more reasons to hate them. This album is a bomb, a stink bomb. I can't stand it and it need never have been made. I hope I'll never have to touch this mutant abomination ever again.\n",
        "\nThe second album by Machine Head, The More Things Change... was when the band decided to make their sound much more streamlined and accessible. This led to a simplifying and reorganization of Machine Head's sound to make an album that relied more on consistency and more complex instrumentation instead of just raw emotion and rage. The More Things Change... is not as angry as Burn My Eyes and actually shows some other emotions from time to time. The More Things Change... also showed both sings of maturity, yet also foreshadowed Machine Head's fall into nu metal mediocrity. The More Things Change..., while a decent release, was also a troubling sign of things to come.\n\nThe More Things Change... shows more addition of modern and alternative elements to their music. The increase in melodic singing is a welcome addition and breaks up the monotony of the usual shouting. The bass is also more prominent in this album, allowing for heavier riffage and more engaging rests, breaks, and intros in the songs. The signature drilling guitars are still here and work decently to bring out the ideas of the songs. The lyrics, are unfortunately dumber than the ones on Burn My Eyes. Some good examples of dumb lyrics on this album include the \"COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON!\" at the end of Struck a Nerve and the hilariously idiotic \"I DON'T CARE 'CUZ I DON'T GIVE A FUCK\" on Blistering. Nearly everything except the lyrics have improved and all in all.\n\nThe More Things Change... has more of the songs sounding rather similar with definite beginnings, middles, and ends for all of them. The very best songs are the crushing intro song Ten Ton Hammer plus the five songs afterwards. All the songs move at about mid-pace with blistering thrashing to build tension and more melodic parts to release tension. This allows for them to feel driving without being monotonous. The More Things Change... has consistency and complexity on it's side to let the songs flow well and dispense their rage.\n\nThe More Things Change is a good, but not extraordinary album. It has great songs across the board, but fewer standout songs than Burn My Eyes. Where I can see myself going back to many tracks off of Burn My Eyes, There are only a few songs on The More Things Change... that are truly interesting when it comes to remembering and replaying them. It starts off great and then just goes back to okay instead of Burn My Eyes' mixture of crushing songs. All in all, it's a more accessible release that works to deliver the goods and keep things mostly interesting.\n",
        "\nMachine Head's Burn My Eyes is a release that propelled groove metal to new levels of popularity and aggression and also managed to divide the metal subculture into two camps. One, a group of jaded thrash metal purists who blame Burn My Eyes along with other groove metal releases such as Chaos A.D. and Vulgar Display of Power for the demise of thrash metal in the early 1990's. The other, 90's metal fans enjoy this release for nearly everything it does and defends it almost rabidly against camp number one. These two groups of metal fans have made Burn My Eyes, like most groove metal, one of metal's big controversies.\n\nThe idea that this is a failed attempt at thrash metal is not true in the least, as it was never meant to be thrash in the first place. Sure, while Robb Flynn was a member of Vio-lence, a thrash band. You have to remember that Machine Head is a different band altogether that meant to have a different sound, even if that sound meant moving to another style of metal. You also have to consider that perhaps thrash briefly dying off in the 90's could have been for the genre's own good. Thrash metal, as much as I love it, was getting very same-y by the dawn of the 90's with a lot of bands sounding generic and highly derivative of one another. Record labels were trying to push as many new thrash bands as possible and the genre was running out of ideas for the time. Grunge and groove metal may have briefly kicked thrash out of existence, but they also gave thrash it's well needed hiatus from popularity that kept it interesting instead of becoming a pile of regurgitated, boring trash. This album helped give thrash some necessary shut eye while carving itself a unique place in the groove metal circle. But I could argue about legacies, styles, and genres all I want, but that's not what we're here for. You want to know about the music.\n\nAll I could say is that this album is blistering and pissed off. It's seething with rage and anger at almost all times. The drilling guitar tone and riffs serve to further this feeling of frustrated rage. Vocals are usually shouted angrily and the guitars are often used to make painful screeching sound effects when they feel necessary. Instrument wise, it's beyond mad; almost to the point of lashing out violently and biting your ear off.\n\nDavidian kicks the album off with raging guitars and destructive, forceful riffs accompanied by Robb's enraged vocals which detail violent political attitude (i.e. LET FREEDOM RING WITH A SHOTGUN BLAST!) and just general destruction throughout. This song is a winner. Old starts off with a static-y narration and thudding bass which leads into one of the best groove metal riffs out there which could certainly get you up and moving. Old is also structured to build tension and it succeeds well moving towards the end with it's rising chorus that builds up into the thunderous ending. These first two songs get the album off to a good start and send a message of condensed rage.\n\nThe next four songs vary in quality with two being decent and the others falling flat A Thousand Lies doesn't start off too bad and has a decent riff to it. A heavy, driving groove is laid out for the song and turns it into a nice stomp-fest. None But My Own is mostly just chugging and shouting, nothing interesting there.Then The Rage To Overcome comes along and relies on scathing buildup to keep the destruction going. Death Church though, is flat and boring, moving at a snail's pace. You should skip that one\n\nThe last five songs finish this album on a blistering note. A Nation On Fire and Blood For Blood speed things back up and the songwriting improves into something somewhat structured. They're blistering tracks that up the ante for violence and sounds like they're just spoiling for a fight. I'm Your God Now is my favorite song off this album as it builds off of a grim intro and shows some semblance of emotion aside from anger. It starts off melancholy and morose and the anger is toned down a bit. On this album, that's a welcome break. It launches into slamming riffs while giving a swirling chorus and a structure with a break towards the end that builds tension for the shredding ending. Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies is a transition track with sinister atmosphere and samples of fiery political material. It could be a really great experimental track, the only part I don't care for is when Robb decides to interject; but otherwise, it's a good song. And finally, Block closes the album with a rumbling riff that would be very easy to start moving around to and take out the pent up anger that Burn My Eyes builds. It succeeds as a song and it would be hard to fight the need to throw yourself around when hearing it. This last song closes the album on a satisfying note.\n\nBurn My Eyes Is a violent and dangerous example of 90's groove metal and one of the better albums in the genre. The songs on this album are vicious and memorable, leaving an echo in your head. The later songs on the album work especially well to it's advantage and Burn My Eyes certainly works for me. It's a blistering exercise in viciousness and it would certainly do to give this one a listen.\n",
        "\nMachine Head are perhaps one of the most misunderstood bands within the (true) metal community, and their 1994 debut is perhaps the most bright example of it. The album has gathered some criticism for it's poor resemblance of thrash metal. But why is it even considered a thrash album in the first place? The fact that the frontman of the band is a former guitarist of Vio-Lence is a laughably invalid reason for this bias. Listen to this album for what it is, rate it for what it is - a slightly thrash-influenced groove metal LP, and you will learn to appreciate it for the ass-kicking record that it really is.\n\nOne of the things I like about the album the most is its production - so heavy, yet so clear. I don't remember hearing anything produced as good as this ever before 1994 and by my own experience I can safely say that most albums produced even some years after this one fall under by quality. The guitar tone is sick, the drums are blasting-heavy and both of these are accompanied by a bass that fits perfectly into the temperature scale of the other instruments. \n\nMusically speaking, the strongest side of Burn My Eyes are riffs - riffs that are groovy as fuck and weigh over a ton. Maybe they aren't the most technically proficient riffs ever, but I can hardly recall ones that are as groovy and catchy as the main riff of Old, or riffs that make as inspired use of natural harmonics as the ones from Davidian. Not all songs here have a solo, and even among those that have there isn't particularly many that are worth mentioning, but on the bright side each solo seems like it's in its place. Furthermore, this is the type of metal that can be enjoyable even without leads flying around in every song.\n\nLike it is typical for Machine Head - the drumming is good. Not as outstandingly good as the work of Dave McLain on the later albums but still quite impressive. Chris Kontos on here is without a doubt much better than McLain was on the next couple of albums, and when comparing what McLain is capable of nowadays and what Kontos could back in 1994 - it's actually pretty damn close.\n\nAdam Duce as a bassist never impressed me, and he doesn't to this day, but his contribution as a backing vocalist is worth pointing out on some occasions. I would even argue that Duce would make a much better lead vocalist than Flynn is. Which leads me to...\n\n...the bad: Robb Flynn's utterly terrible, uninspired, sophomoric... I can't even find the right word to describe how fucking ill of a singer Flynn is. Don't get me wrong here, I respect the hell out of Flynn as a songwriter and guitarist, but he should have never attempted harsh vocals. Yes, harsh vocals, because his clean singing on some Machine Head songs like Descend the Shades of Night, Darkness Within and others is actually pretty good. That said, I don't want him to attempt power metal vocals on further MH albums, but his usual vocal style is a massive pain to the ears. Maybe if he would have attempted growling, I would give this album a 99% rating.\n\nAnother drawback are the lyrics, the second most annoying thing about Machine Head. Again, Flynn has a talent of writing decent music, but his poetry is almost as mediocre as Louie Clemente's drumming on the classic Testament albums.\n\nNegative aspects aside, Burn My Eyes has good songwriting overall, it tries to deliver groove, and it does it damn well. Mostly the songs here are mid-tempo, but there are a few faster ones like Blood for Blood and A Nation on Fire (towards the end). There are some acoustic sections that are also really enjoyable, like the intro of A Nation Fire (one of the finest moments off the whole LP imo) and I'm Your God Now. It may run for a bit too long, but it includes some unpredictable moments in it as well that keep you from falling asleep. \n\nIn conclusion, Burn My Eyes is heavy, groovy, sometimes thrashy, maybe other times even shitty, but overall a very decent and well produced album. If you are a fan of thrash metal, don't even bother finding something to your preference in this. I do however recommend this to any listener of metal who doesn't expect anything at all from this - the best way to enjoy this classic is to drop down your preferences and give a fresh look to music that you typically wouldn't listen to. It takes time to grow, for me personally, it took quite a lot. But for now, I enjoy the hell out of this every time I decide to put it on a full spin. Do check this album out, if you still haven't, and see what Burn My Eyes might do to you.\n",
        "\nThe Blackening, the sixth record by American post-thrash/groove metal outfit Machine Head, is an overlong exercise in attempting to stay awake for its duration. The music on this record is a jumbled up amalgamation of third rate thrash metal, groove metal, hardcore and traces of nu-metal where none of the traces of the above sub-genres are well written enough to stand out on their own. The composed music is structurally very simple and comprises of mediocre riffs and leads which are repeated at least a dozen of times in a track just to extend its duration. The music being extremely simple, technical performances are simply not worth mentioning. The vocals when aggressive are lame Phil Anselmo ripped off shouts that sound more like the vocalist being raped rather than being angry. Though nothing special, the lead work is decent and works as the highlight of many of the tracks. In making the music sound angry, the band looses focus in making the music catchy and listenable. The choruses are lame, many a times featuring a very hideous melodic breakdown which is compounded by the fact that Rob Flynn cannot hold a note steady. Pantera Walk, this is not. The tracks are long just for the sake of being long. Progressions attempted in the tracks are very horrible and lack a general sense of cohesion in them. \n\nThe tracks that stand out include Clenching The Fists Of Dissent and Aesthetics of Hate. Both of the above tracks, though overlong, contain at least some parts where the music is fast and thrashy. The former does contain some very horrible pace changes and it sounds hideous when the music gets mid-paced. Now I Lay Thee Down, Halo, Slanderous and A Farewell To Arms are all boring, mid-paced and overlong tracks with none of the musical elements presented in the tracks working properly. Now I Lay Thee Down especially contains a very horribly written chorus and is an abomination at best. Wolves contains some decent sections in its overlong nine minute duration but are sandwiched between moments of insane mediocrity and thus as a whole turns out to be nothing more than a failure. \n\nThe fact that the album was highly praised by main-stream media at its release, being hailed as a modern masterpiece of thrash metal when the said sub-genre was actually quite niggard in the messed up jumble of ideas that were present in the compositions, is one of the biggest jokes of the decade. The shitty song-writing and composition coupled with even worse execution makes this album unfit to hear even once. Bottom-line; The Blackening is not recommended to any fan of thrash metal or even groove metal whose fans might be able to sympathize with the album with a warning to stay away from it.\n",
        "\nEven after all of the years that have passed, I still cannot believe just how woefully underrated this album is. I still rate this as one of their best, and it is certainly one of their most interesting albums to date. The production by Ross Robinson is astonishing, deep, layered, and organic, and is one of those recordings that rewards with repeated listens. There is so much detail and nuance, you can pick out new details with every listen. It is definitely metal, but it is more experimental, textured, and colourful than their other albums. There is a refreshing lack of guitar soloing with more emphasis on guitar sounds, effects, and interplay between the two excellent guitarists. The drumming is classy, polished, and understated and the bass snakes and writhes, dark and economic. There is some great use of melody and beautifully-placed guitar effects. There is a great piece within the stunning \"Five\" that just comes out of nowhere, soft and mournful, that adds great texture and mood to the track (at 3.06). Other highlights, of which there are many, include \"Exhale The Vile\", \"Silver\", \"The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears\", and \"I Defy\", although every track is essential and holds its own place within the whole context of the recording. The running order of the tracks is perfection and there is a superb version of \"Message In A Bottle\" by The Police in the mid-section that gives the album a better feel and breaks it nicely into two sections.\n\nI really wish they had pursued this sound more, but then I suppose that's what makes this album so special. It stands alone (burning red) as such a unique and unusual album. This is an album that has been perfectly named.\n\nIt ends with the haunting, ethereal, broken distortion of \"The Burning Red\" that slowly morphs into something vast and floating. like watching the sun swirling into a great red cloud. Robb Flynn has a great gift for melody and there is some very cool harmony that he sings towards the end of this track. I would be very interested to hear Machine Head with more emphasis on melody as the quieter sections of their songs are very interesting. Machine Head really pushed themselves on this album, proving to be very versatile musicians.\n\nRecorded at Indigo Ranch, The Burning Red defines Machine Head as a unique band who were well ahead of their time with a brave, bold album that really deserves closer inspection and appreciation.\n",
        "\nThe Blackening has gotten a lot of hype, it was heralded as a big comeback when it came out, and five years later it is still talked about. I'm not quite sure what they're coming back to, they were never very good and this album is loaded with awful nu-metal shit, going overboard with chugging and still revolving around the terrible nu-metal shouter who sings worse than Anders Friden's worst croaking. Much worse. What they're trying to do here is a monstrosity - dragging out the same old nu-metal shit with flavor of the week thrashmetalcore and a lot of really bad lead guitar playing. All of that is end-to-end, which explains the four songs that add up to ~40 minutes. It's awful. Machine Head are a very crude sum of their components, and a bullet-point list offers better organization than any song on the album.\n\nBad riffs\n-Nu metal chugging that's not even catchy, devoid of the catchy grooves that anchor the genre as their main hooks. \n-Leftover mallcore riffs reworked into weak metalcore grooves that that could pass off as extras from an early Chimaira album.\n-An occasional piece that sounds like some sort of unoriginal metalcore/thrash like Trivium.\n\nBad melodies\n-Lame radio rock choruses with a singer that doesn't even have the charisma of a typical butt rock singer, sort of like Puddle of Mudd but less memorable. Read everything that All That Remains' detractors say about their singer in the last five years, this is as bad as people say that is.\n-Completely aimless random melodic noodling, often harmonized, that goes nowhere. It's not a guitar solo that grabs the feeling of the song and soars with it, it's more like an amateur chopping through 16th notes at a moderate pace with no idea where he's going with it, nor any idea where it started. \n\nThese components have been slapped together by a lot of alternative hard rock, nu-metal, and groove/metalcore bands, but the songwriting here is a major detractor. Two songs are over ten minutes, another two are over nine, and they go absolutely nowhere really slowly. \"Halo\" drags on whole hopping between a nu metal groove and a wussy chorus until they're both worn out, then an extended noodling section that brings you to the halfway point. A third of the way into each song I'm begging for it to be over, and halfway through I don't know what they could even be trying to do. There are also a handful of long, distant sounding intros/outros that rival the intensity of an opening band's soundcheck. They might be going for something atmospheric, which is a very poor decision when the intro could wear out the welcome of a song that would be terrible without it. \n\nThere are a few good moments on the album. \"Aesthetics of Hate\" starts out with some decent riffing, and the final track has a decent melodic section buried over six minutes in. One of each done well in over an hour, contrasting with the rest of the album that's no good at all. A broken clock is right twice a day, but apparently they couldn't sort out any of the mediocrity which fills most of the running time. The vocals are unforgivably awful throughout the whole album, but it seems that Robb Flynn could do better, as it sounds like he actually tries to sing on the Iron Maiden cover that's a bonus track - on all of the album tracks, he whines like he belongs on the Family Values Tour. \n\nThe most glaring failure of this album is that the veteran nu-metal band isn't even good at being nu-metal. They don't have the funk and swagger of Korn or E.Town Concrete, who borrow it from hip-hop. They don't have the driving feel of Static X or Powerman 5000, who chug on one or two power chords like they mean it, and also know when to end a song. They don't even have the obnoxious and truly offensive waggle of Limp Bizkit. Machine Head are delusional about being a shitty nu metal band, they're not even good at it, and by throwing all the shit they want to be into the mix, they put together something that's in the basement of nu-metal with Kittie, though at least they seem to embrace the spectacle they put on. It's not shameless like that, it's shameful nu-metal that tries to not be what it is, it tries to be something else that it can't be at the same time, and it comes out in these awful ten minute misadventures. They're too concerned with mixing in some Pantera-aping and throwing in lots of solos that they couldn't do a single one of them well. \n\nTen minute nu-metal songs, what the fuck?\n",
        "\nThey were slowly, but surely gaining momentum with albums like The More Things Change\u2026, Supercharger and Through the Ashes of Empires, but what put Machine Head on the global map was their landmark album, The Blackening. Filled with heavy riffs and rhythms and steeped in rich atmosphere, as well as incredibly relatable lyrics, this album stripped metal\u2019s sounds down to its bare roots and reminded everyone how powerful the good music is.\n\nWhen people think metal, the stereotype often includes the gruff or screamed vocals heard from the likes of Slayer, Cannibal Corpse and even Metallica. While Machine Head uses this style, they\u2019ve been able to incorporate clean vocals, spoken parts and even whispered parts into the album. What makes them unique is their ability to jump from these quieter, acoustic parts into this full-blown metal attack, proving power doesn\u2019t always need to come from sheer volume. Songs like Halo and A Farewell to Arms really showcase this talent, while the into of Clenching the Fists of Dissent sounded like something you\u2019d find out of Metallica\u2019s Black Album.\n\nNow, the guitars are important for any metal band, and most bands will put in a decent amount of time to make their guitar parts worthwhile. For me, The Blackening really shows the listener the internal conflict between guitars and the vocalist, and just how amazing great guitar parts can be. With trademark riffs coming from Beautiful Mourning and Wolves, as well as Halo. Now I Lay Thee Down also includes clean vocals with thick electric guitars, giving listeners a different combination to try out. However, I\u2019d love to hear the bass more in songs such as Halo. Hearing the bass line gives the intro a whole new timbre that changes the entire vibe, as well as preparing us for the heaviness that is yet to come.\n\nRobb Flynn has usually been the main lyrist for the band, and has garnered a reputation for being excellent with words. He opens Clenching the Fists of Dissent, A Farewell to Arms and Beautiful Mourning with simple phrases and/or single words that really grab your attention before moving into themes of war and revolution, or discussing the idea of murder and death in Now I Lay Thee Down. Flynn also figures out 1001 ways one can feel disgust towards oneself in Slanderous and a general dissent toward Christianity, while Wolves just seethes rage in the form of\u2026.well, wolves. \n\nIt should also be said that Machine Head loves long, long songs with the occasional long, long name. Often bands drag out the songs to get them and have lots of filler to get them to 9 or 10 minutes, but the songs Machine Head does sound better as they get longer, and fans have actually complained about the clipped versions of songs (go check out the offical music video of Halo on Youtube if you want some proof). \n\nOne nice thing that longer songs do allow is solos, whether it is guitar solos, drum solos or just pure instrumentals. Machine Head took full advantage of this and put at least one solo in every song, even two in a couple of them! Even better, it didn\u2019t sound like filler, like in the case of Iron Maiden\u2019s Dream of Mirrors, where it sounded great for the first 5-6 minutes, and then both you and they realize that they need more stuff to do for the rest of the song and it just sounds like it could\u2019ve been that much better organized.\n\nAfter listening to The Blackening several times, I now understand how it helped propel them into the mainstream metal scene. With memorable solos, beautifully written lyrics and a general sense of what metal is, these guys have obviously worked hard to get this far.\n",
        "\nTo be honest, I didn't really like The Blackening. Aside from some riffs here and there and Aesthetics of Hate, I always thought that the whole fuss about it was not of any actual content. Unto the Locust, though, is a different story.\n\nThe songs in general are still longer than those on Burn My Eyes, yet are, thank fuck, shorter than the ones on The Blackening. As a result, the epic tone of The Blackening is retained and in the meanwhile, the songs represent a more mature band than most of their earlier stuff does. Yes, it does indeed make sense, however not many bands release such killer material 17 years after a killer debut album. The production makes a crucial contribution to the overall essence of the album, thus endowing the band with a gigantic sound that retains their edge while becoming huger than it was on their previous efforts.\n\nSo, what are the ingredients for the band's success? The classics, of course. You can hear influences from a variety of styles so wide that the only genre this band can be said to belong to is heavy metal. The obvious ones are early thrash acts like Metallica, Heathen, and Forbidden, classic heavy metal acts like Iron Maiden, and of course the groove metal style that they themselves created alongside Pantera. Another obvious influence is Deep Purple, which is the first commercially successful hard rocking band to write songs in this fashion - long, yet heavy-hitting. Damn, they even got their name from DP's album, what did you expect? What makes this album unique, though, is the less obvious stuff. Fourth track \"This is the End\" perfectly depicts the group's genius of blending different styles. The song starts with an acoustic intro that makes you sure that the song will evolve in a thrasher like Metallica's \"Battery\", yet the band takes the patent one step further with riffs that bring to mind stuff as diverse as Emperor, Atheist, and even Hacride (funny fact, \"hacride\" is derived from the Greek word for \"locust\"). The riffs themselves are sometimes thrashy, sometimes mid-paced and heavy, sometimes shredding, and sometimes melodic and direct (such as in \"Locust\", for example). This plethora of styles leads to the aforementioned sense of listening to pure heavy metal.\n\nFlynn's vocals have evolved and improved. The harsher vocals sound more aggressive and less forced and the cleaner vocals are simply light years ahead, as shown in \"Darkness Within\", where Flynn's words could even be claimed as sounding like Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor. The drumming is also influenced by a variety of styles, featuring double bass parts that have their roots in Obituary, thrashy parts, and maybe even some d-beats. The bass is huge and clean cut, punching your stomach with every hit of the strings.\n\nThe only complaints I have is about the children choir in \"Who We Are\" that sometimes sounds stupid, and about the introduction of \"Be Still and Know\" that is reminiscent of \"Now I Lay Thee Down\". Well, there's also the first fast riff on \"I Am Hell\" that sounds like \"Aesthetics of Hate\", but that one is fucking killer so I don't have any objections concerning this matter. Otherwise, \"Unto the Locust\" is probably the best mainstream metal album of 2011, blowing away Opeth's \"Heritage\" and Mastodon's \"The Hunter\". It emits infinite heavy metal majesty which I believe renders it an instant classic. METAL UP YOUR ASS!\n",
        "\nOne reason reviewers even write is to open people\u2019s eyes to new album releases and hopefully give more of an incentive to check it out. It pleases me when I get to write about rare albums like this, an album that starts another chapter in a band that has as much history on the music scene as Machine Head does. From their debut Burn My Eyes to Supercharger, they brought forth an unrelenting thrash assault onto the same stomping grounds Metallica and Slayer are from and almost singlehandedly invented a brand new chapter in thrash metal. Through The Ashes Of Empires and The Blackening marked the re-invention of the band into a whole new metal behemoth. Unto The Locust is the beginning of the third inception of Machine Head.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that this album has only seven tracks (ten if you count bonus tracks), which is unusually short for a Machine Head album. Based from my interview with Dave McClain [drummer] earlier this year, he stated that they have increasing difficulty writing songs under six minutes, and only one of the songs on the new album Unto The Locust is under that time.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there are still plenty of elements from their old releases. By listening to this without any indication, you can still tell this is the same exact band, but their sound covers a much broader spectrum than ever before. I\u2019m even inclined to say that there is a more progressive element in the songwriting structure as well. Before you even say it, no, The Blackening is not progressive in any way. It\u2019s straight-on heavy metal/thrash with really long songs. Song length alone doesn\u2019t make a band progressive.\n\nWith the substantial force of the opening of \u201cI Am Hell (Sonata In C#)\u201d calling your undivided attention, it then goes into a full thrash onslaught with plenty of impressive guitar work that will make any guitar lover listen in awe. This is about as close as you will get to hearing their \u201cfirst\u201d inception influences (Burn My Eyes-era). If you\u2019ve heard the so-called \u201cadvance mix\u201d of the \u201cThe Locust,\u201d then you pretty much know what to expect. Not really, as it sounds much heavier than the fancily titled demo track. There are a few parts that stand out over the demo; the sound spectrum placement of the drums is different and there are more guitar parts spread out in the song. Overall it\u2019s a good fit to be the title track, as it properly sums up the entire album.\n\nThe standout track is \u201cDarkness Within.\u201d Usually I will say why this is the standout to me, but I will leave that Easter egg for you to discover. I will say that I love this song and it\u2019s a very different take on Machine Head that I\u2019ve never seen.\n\nThere have been a few albums released this year that really bummed me out, but I always know I can count on Machine Head to deliver a delightful and enthralling album that (yet again) leaves me wanting more. Although I knew it would be extremely difficult for them to ever top The Blackening, they still did an excellent job.\n",
        "\nThe albums of Machine Head of \u201ctoday\u201d are completely strange from those that were made at the beginning (though indeed those decent are only two). \u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d was the first album of this band and one of the best (post) thrash metal albums of the \u201990s years. In a few words, a very great debut influenced by thrash metal bands like Slayer and Metallica (in regards to the riffs, solos, and lyrics\u2026) and Pantera and Sepultura (in regards ti the style of singing of Robb Flynn).\n\nThis album proposes to us thrash/groove metal that's raw and massive from to the old and wise Bay Area and this we can understand thanks to opener \u201cDavidian\u201d with effective drumming from Chris Kontos and a beautiful chorus that sets off one of the phrases most famous for the band: \u201clet freedom ring with a shotgun blast\u201d. The next one, \u201cOld\u201d, is also a good song that follows the same rhythm as the previous song, but this time to give way to the dances is the powerful bass of Adam Duce that can be heard easily. \u201cA Thousand Lies\u201d is also a very hectic song that rages after a slow start and possesses a solo that's distorted and fast. \u201cNone But my Own\u201d has more or less the same level as the previous songs in that the chorus issues an inhuman rage. This song also possesses an adrenaline solo.\n\nThe other songs that have fascinated me on this album are two semi-ballads, \u201cA Nation on Fire\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Your God Now\u201d, an element that seeks traces of the ballads of Metallica. The first is good and triggers the end with an heavy riff accompanied with the pounding drums of Kontos. The second is my absolute favourite with a fantastic instrumental section where the singing of Flynn is clean at the beginning, but once more approaches to the chorus and the vocals become aggressive. Then there is the short \u201cBlood for Blood\u201d, a blow to the teeth of thrash metal that remembers old Slayer, an headbanging song where halfway though is a melodic part that can resume breathing and afterward breaks out again.\n\nUnfortunately, this album presents \u201cfiller songs\u201d, and these are \u201cThe Rage to Overcome\u201d, \u201cDeath Church\u201d, \u201cReal Eyes, Realize, Real Lies\u201d, and the final track, \u201cBlock\u201d. They aren\u2019t bad, but rather on a good level, but not like the previous songs. The first has a good instrumental section, but the voice of Flynn isn\u2019t very convincing. The second is slower and the rhythm drops, but it makes for pleasant listening, disturbing that species of a \u201csubliminal message\u201d that's at the beginning of the song. The third song is a semi-instrumental song of high-level when, at the end, Robb Flynn sets out screaming loudly the words of the title. The finale, \u201cBlock\u201d, closes the album with violence, missing the solo and is replaced by an instrumental and spectacular section. Also, this one remembers the closing of Metallica\u2019s albums (\u201cMetal Militia\u201d, \u201cDamage, Inc.\u201d, \u201cDyers Eve\u201d, and \u201cThe Struggle Within\u201d).\n\n\u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d, after all, is a good album and doesn\u2019t present significant drops in rhythm, but unfortunately after that \u201cThe More Things Change\u2026\u201d is oriented to a more commercial genre. But it must be remembered that this album and the next are the two open-circuits to the movement of post-thrash/groove metal, together with \u201cFar Beyond Driven\u201d.\n",
        "\nI will start this with a bang: I had a boring Sunday afternoon listening to this album. \n\nAt first I heard that it had longer songs. Obviously that raised in me a concern about filler material. However after listening to the song \"Aesthetics of Hate\" those thoughts disappeared from my mind, and I was motivated into it. What I couldn't guess was that the aforementioned song was the worthiest material off that album. \n\nThis album is typically seen by Machine Head fans as their best album of all time. In fact, it was promoted by mainstream music magazines as \"this generation's Master of Puppets\". Which in some way makes sense: it's the most overrated metal album of this generation from a kilometer away. Is it bad? No, by no means. Still, it's much worse than everyone says it is, not to mention that it is much worse than the material this band has recorded up to 1997. Even their previous album manages to be better than this. And why? Because it is redundant. Everything that they do in this album has already been done before so many times that there's no one in the planet who can have a perfect account. As a consequence, while the first half of the album is exciting and thrashing, the other half feels tiring and beaten. \n\nGiven that this album is trying hard to capture the spirit of the great classic thrash metal albums of the late 80s, the riffs are its forte. The addition of Phil Demmel back in 2003 resulted in a significant improvement on the band, and that can be heard in tracks like \"Beautiful Morning\" (less than five minutes, but still a beast) and \"Aesthetics of Hate\", arguably the best track in the album. There's also a new, more melodic influence on the band, which results in the neo-classical feel of tracks like \"Now I Lay Thee Down\". However, in this album that neo-classical feel won't be as vital as in their next. Overall, the riffing makes the band shift away from its Biohazard-inspired groove thrash antics of Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change..., becoming closer to a technical thrash-like sound, with cues of bands like Annihilator and Coroner, although Adam Duce's hard-sounding bass still makes it sound a bit like 1994.\n\nThe drums are also a point of interest on this album. I've always put Dave McClain below Chris Kontos, and I still do, but The Blackening showcased that McClain is quite a drummer. He's precise, he's harsh, he's technical, and his style fits the music quite well, such as in the intro for \"Halo\". I have to give him merit for that, even if this is not the best we've seen from this band (*cough* \"The Rage to Overcome\" *cough*). \n\nFlynn's vocals are one of two factors that further contribute for this album to sound beaten after a while. In this album, we see absolutely nothing new in his vocal style. We already knew, Robb, you can sing, scream, yell, swear and growl. And we already knew you could write songs about religion, war and struggle. Apart from the brilliant anti-anti-metal protest of \"Aesthetics of Hate\" (a reply to the eponymous article by the American fascist William Grim, who dared to disrespect Dimebag Darrell), there's nothing which hasn't been seen before.\n\nThe other factor is that the band jumped in the long song bandwagon, making the album's redundancy even worse. Two of the songs (out of 8) last over 10 minutes. That's a great thing to do when you've actually got a lot of musically revolutionary ideas to fit in one song (just look at Edge of Sanity), but - as I've stated before - this album contains almost nothing new to fans of this band or genre. The result is that these songs stand simply to drag the album, which is sad.\n\nThe Blackening is most certainly not a bad album. In fact it's quite good, riffy and thrashing, as you'd expect. The question is that, unlike Machine Head's two first albums, it does not contain any new or unexpected elements. It may be a pretty solid album, and better than anything these guys have done with Ahrue Luster, but in no way this is their best album.\n",
        "\nIt seems that the Machine found its Head again, two years after that 2001 disaster. Unlike what it may feel, Machine Head did not simply return to their old-school style. Instead, they recreated it with new classic thrash influences, which is rather expected, given that this record was made with Phil Demmel (ex-Vio-lence) on the lead guitar. Please note that this means that Machine became the closest thing possible to a modern groovy version of Bay Area thrash: the guitarists from Vio-lence and the drummer who used to be from Sacred Reich. There's more to this album than just that, though.\n\nAfter the mess made in Supercharger, it'd be expectable for some no-nonsense music and here we have it. It is arguably the best album they've made since 1997. They have totally quit the old 13-year-old n\u00fc-metal attitude. There are no more soap opera songs here. This, it should be said, is an all-out metal record that has been crafted for war. Right at the start of the album, the song \"Imperium\" reveals just that - militaresque drumming, aggressive and angry vocals, and lots of riffs. Machine have found their Head, and please note that rebirth is not all that easy for a band, especially when done this way.\n\nAs I said before, this album has the guitarists from Vio-lence (both of them, in fact). That is reflected in the album's riffing; we're back to a style that combines pre-1999 Machine elements with more classic sounds that can be found on Vio-lence's discography. It looks a bit like they went back to the origin in order to fix the future. However, something of a chugging groove remains, such as in \"In the Presence of My Enemies\". Also featured here is the use of melody, namely in the track \"Elegy\", with skill and precision.\n\nThe drumming is probably the best that has been made by Dave McClain 'til then, and I'm counting not only The More Things Change..., but also his material with Sacred Reich with that. Technical and aggressive with a smarter use of blastbeats than in Machine Head's sophomore record. It's probably one of the highest spots of the album.\n\nRobb Flynn's vocal performance here largely exceeds anything made by him after 1997 and may even stand close to their first two albums. His combination of aggressive yelling and melodic singing resembles something out of the more memorable side of The Burning Red tinged with their early material. Sure, it still sounds much \u00e0 la Jonathan Davis in songs like \"Wipe the Tears\" (I mean, just look at the title), but Flynn manages to showcase skill, and he song \"Elegy\" is a testament of that. The sole problem is that, hum, the lyrical content has only SLIGHTLY improved. It seems that we can't really have everything.\n\nI will elect \"Elegy\" and \"Imperium\" as my favourite songs off this album and give it a rating in the mid-80s because, while not being their best album by any means, it is way better than the two albums that preceded it (especially the 2001 mess-up that preceded it). It may not be enough to maintain Machine Head as a credible band (they managed to fix that, though), but it deserves to be called a comeback album. As I said before, this Machine just found its Head.\n",
        "\nIn my previous review of Machine Head's \"The Blackening\", I called upon listeners to give what is undoubtedly this California based post-thrash quartet's best album a strong chance, and rightfully so. I don't feel like I need to repeat myself on what exactly \"The Blackening\" did right that makes it a worthy listen, but among it's many flaws, it was an album that left me with a lot of questions. Where exactly was Machine Head going to go after \"The Blackening\". After hearing how positive of an effort that album was, I liked to believe that Machine Head had found a musical blueprint they could build off of. Well, it's been a few years now, and now Machine Head is upon his again with another full length album.\n\nI have no idea where Machine Head's sudden fascination with etymology emerged from, so I'm going to give my own thoughts on what exactly this album should've been called. It should've been called, as a sequel to \"The Blackening\", \"The Mess Up\". There is no other way to put it, this album is a pure mess up. What Machine Head did with \"Unto the Locust\" is take some one staple ingredient from \"The Blackening\", long (by average song standards) song lengths, get rid of nearly all the progressions and melodies that made the music on that album so strong, and instead replace it with a whole lot of worthless guitar harmonies and bouts of monotonous chugging that absolutely does not work. As a result, \"Unto the Locust\" seems absolutely senseless. \n\nI don't understand that after creating an album that was so progressive and actually a reasonably thrashy outing how Machine Head could become so mindless. This is without a doubt one of the choppiest albums I have ever heard, and not in that overly technical or progressive way that is somewhat alright. No, this is choppy in a manner that make most of the songs sound unfinished. Most of the progressions are completely overbuilt up to, and for the most part they absolutely suck. And then they end up shifting into something that sounds absolutely mindless. This is not a problem for just one song on Unto the Locust, it's a problem for every song on the album. No where is this worse then the intro track I am Hell. This track sounds like an unfinished song left off The Blackening's final cut, because it contains most of what that album's songs contained, except for the good things. \n\nAlso, there are way too many moments where Machine Head just tries to get into these dark, droning, moody passages. Admittedly, some of these bits are fine, but most of them go on for way too long. The intro harmony to Be Still and Know initially had me paying attention at first, but when it started going on for longer than twenty seconds I started losing interest. That whole introductory harmony section to that particular song goes on for a grand total of forty seconds. That is so long that the harmony wears itself out. Pity, because that's the best part of the song. The same can apply to the title track, which has a clean section that just goes on for way too long and just makes the song sound stale. \n\nThe musicianship has also degraded significantly from The Blackening. The riffs of Robb and Phil are far more rudimentary on Unto the Locust. They feature a lot of palm muted chugging and not much else. Yeah, there are some cool sounding harmonies here and there and some of the riffs that aren't just complete two chord chugging sound okay, but nothing really stands out here from the absolute viciousness that was the riff work on The Blackening. Also, the guitar solos have also fallen off massively. Most of them are far too short to be any bit memorable, and they're about as rudimentary fast as they come. Just a lot of tremolo picked pentatonics, which absolutely bores the snot out of me. Adam Duce is Adam Duce, a supporting bassist who really deserves no merit. \n\nBut perhaps the most disappointing musical drop-off is that of drummer Dave McClain. After putting on what I thought was one of the best all around drum performances I have ever heard on a metal album, McClain's drums now stink. Most of the beats just plod along lifelessly with the guitars and have no zest or punch that they used to. There just is sense that all he wanted to do was \"play along\" and there are no moments where the drums propel the songs forward like they did on The Blackening. All in all, a very boring performance compared to The Blackening. \n\nThe one aspect of Unto the Locust that I do find redeemable is the vocal performance by Robb Flynn. It actually is better than The Blackening's vocal performance. A lot of the purely clean vocals were dropped from Unto the Locust, and it benefited Mr. Flynn as a whole. His voice sounds a lot more guttural and vicious then it did on The Blackening, less pissed off and more like legitimately possessed at some moments. Yeah, it's that deep and that clear at the same time. Some of the moments where things do get a bit more operatic per say, they sound a lot better. The operatic sections don't sound as melodramatic as they did on The Blackening, they just seem to ring out more and echo louder than they did in the past. The lyrics aren't as terrible either. They're more introspective and abstract than the in your face banter of The Blackening, and I think it works. One problem though is that a lot of the vocal patterns are not particularly catchy, so these are not exactly memorable lyrics in that regard. \n\nAs far as the mix goes, it's not as good as The Blackening's mix was. It's simply too dry. Most of the time I can hardly even tell that there is bass present in the mix, and the guitars have no real punch to them the way they did on the previous album's mix. The drums sound okay, though they sound more like plastic then they did before and I don't like that. The guitar solo tone is improved to degree, but not that much to make me really say it's that amazing. The vocals do get a nice treatment though, and they're pleasing in that regard. \n\nSo all in all, Unto the Locust is not a good album. It tries to replicate the success of The Blackening without doing any of the things that made The Blackening such a good album, and in that regard it falls flat on it's face. Machine Head will have to go back to the drawing board when it comes to their next album, because this one is nothing but a mess up.\n",
        "\nWe've seen this before. Every band has it. That particular album that pretty much FAILS its task. In this particular case, the task wasn't that hard. A return to Machine Head's old glorious groove thrash style at this point wouldn't be impossible, given that this is right at the beginning of the (later dubbed) New Wave of American Heavy Metal, in which the one-riff-groove mantra of the n\u00fc-metal era was dropped in favour of harder sonorities. Yet somehow they thought that it would be a good idea to dig even further into n\u00fc-metal territory with even softer riffs and vocals. This album can be only rated as a disaster. \n\nMachine Head's 2001 offer picks up where its predecessor (1999's The Burning Red) started. Problem is that album wasn't anything brilliant to start with, especially given that it was significantly worse than both albums that had preceded it. However, Supercharger ends up by falling in a new abyss. Digging further into the realms of mainstream metal and hard rock, it features arguably the worst set of tunes this Oakland band has ever written.\n\nThe chunky riffs (as usual, one per song) continue here, starting right at the beginning of \"Bulldozer\". The main difference between this and The Burning Red, though, is that they become perpetual elements. Worsening the situation, Ahrue Luster does not really do anything to \"move\" the songs forward, resulting in an annoying perpetual groove (e.g. \"Trephination\"). There is some melody, though. The problem is that it is only nicely used once (the song \"Crashing Around You\", one of the few decent songs off this album), and then we've got songs like \"American High\". It's just vaguely decent, with some fail in the middle.\n\nThe drums aren't much better. Sure, McClain comes up with some decent drumming here and there (\"Crashing Around You\", \"Supercharger\"), but most of it is in near-complete lacking of a technical side and instead follows the groove-chug way, and this came from the band that wrote the song \"The Rage to Overcome\".\n\nRobb Flynn's vocals achieved their lowest ever point here. While he manages to sound angry and aggressive in some of the songs, while combining his melodic vocals he sounds like a forced clone of Jonathan Davis in others. This is especially seen in \"Supercharger\" where he uses the cry-and-whisper technique...in a song whose lyrical themes (guitar material, apparently) do not justify such a thing. However, he manages to sound even worse in \"American High\", which is pretty much the WORST song Machine Head have ever made. Remember \"Silver (Take My Hands)\" from The Burning Red? Well, this is even worse. This song sounds like it has been written for a teen soap opera, plus its lyrics (rock'n'roll, rebellion, abuse, etc.) represent everything that is wrong with this album. \n\nFinal verdict: with some work this album could have been better. There are some decent tracks here, and with better attention to the instrumentation (more technical drumming, better riffing, etc.) this could have been a decent record. However, this Machine clearly lost its Head here. I only recommend this album if you're a big fan of Machine Head and you already own most of their material. Otherwise stay away, or see if you can buy the \"Crashing Around You\" single, because that's the best you'll ever get from this album.\n",
        "\nThis is one of my favorite ones off 2011's metal classics. Some say that the bay area thrash movement is the only successful one in the mid-1980's, but for me old school thrash metal bands are keeping their musicianship in their recent achievements, like the formation of Damnation (Testament) & Death Magnetic (Metallica) and the recent Exodus one as well.\n\nBut I always relate the music to new production values and Machine Head's fits in that groove perfectly, completely filled with explosive guitars, solid grooves, thumping bass, and pounding drums. Although thrash metal doesn't sound as convincing as death metal, MH use many death metal-oriented riffs. Modern, yet traditional, Rob Flynn & Co. sound unadulterated right from the first note of 'I Am Hell'. The album takes you through a wild and thrilling ride of superb thrash metal with rowdy riffing, perfectly timed breaks, dazzling solos, and boisterous vocals. MH is pushing the boundaries of thrash metal that the titans Metallica, and Megadeth will have to match this intensity and power to prove their relevance.\n\nAlthough the album starts with an irritating chorus ('I Am Hell'), the music progresses into a flashy guitar intro with a stunning voice running behind and impressive licks in between with a perfect climax as in the next one, \"Be Still and Know\", with machine gun guitar leads & chorus despite the fact that MH's single from this album, \"Locust\", needed some improvement musically. This remastered version is in fact the new wave thrash with a death metal chorus and groovy licks running all the way through. Many bands try to slow down the tempo in between their songs, kind of like Metallica's style followed by a deafening guitar solo. MH seem to have absolutely made justice to the this style of songwriting. And next comes my favorite track off this record. \"This is the End\" starts with kind of a \"Battery\" start (probably Metallica fans would recognize) and is followed by a death metal riff and the solo's the best part of the song. Slow track \"The Darkness Within\" really sets up the atmosphere for the rest of the album, though I didn't embrace the acoustic version of this track in some bonus editions. 'Pearls Before the Swine' is most likely filler with a repetitive chorus. 'Who We Are' starts with children chanting and MH taking over for a perfect ending to a thrash masterpiece. \n\nSome other album versions include two bonus tracks, which are, needless to say, two classics: \"The Sentinel\" by Judas Priest and \"Witch Hunt\" by Rush. Rob manages Halford's aggression in his vocal range, but not really Geddy Lee's. The Priest cover is the best of the two.\n\n---Originally written to http://headbangersherald.blogspot.com-------\n",
        "\nThe period in metal history between 1997 and 2000 was simultaneously one of the best and worst times for the genre. However and sadly, the best part of the era was forgotten and the worst part emphasized, which leads me to the question: is this a reflex of the n\u00fc-metal domination of the era? Yes and no. Unlike many people here, I have a rather tolerant (if skeptical) attitude towards n\u00fc-metal, but like many people here, I can't really stand when bands like Machine Head drop so much of their sound and their roots, and as a consequence I'm not particularly happy with this change of sound, especially given that it becomes possibly more commercial and lacks the rage of old (excuse the pun).\n\nThe fact I will disagree with with most reviewers is that in some way this album presents a continuation of The More Things Change... in creating a more accessible and youthful sound. It is true, the good old technical grooves that marked Machine Head in their previous output are still here to some extent. However, as The More Things Change... was already less precise than Burn My Eyes, The Burning Red is also less precise than The More Things Change.... The most notable nod to the past in this album is undoubtedly the beginning of \"Desire to Fire\", which is in fact an outro that the band used to open their shows in the '90s, in case you didn't know. The angsty track \"Nothing Left\" (featuring Joey Jordison ON VOCALS) and (probably the best song off this album) \"Devil with the King's Card\" (featuring another great vocal actuation by Flynn that reminds me of \"Blood of the Zodiac\" off their previous album) are probably the other \"old school\"-ish songs on this record and arguably the worthiest material from it, thanks to some good drumming interventions from Dave McClain.\n\nHowever, this also has a lot of new influences that may lead an old school fan to think twice before picking this album up, most namely the use and abuse of rap influence. Yeah, RAP. Listening for a minute or so to \"Desire to Fire\" makes one think if the record that had been collected was actually made by the same band that made a living out of a legendary 1994 groove thrash masterpiece (even if the song's chorus may heal it). And that's before hitting the worst part. Some songs here sound not n\u00fc-metal, but post-grunge or alt-rock (!) in influence, such as the horrible track \"Silver (From This Day)\", which by misfortune ended up being the album's main single. Out of nothing, the same man that once yelled \"Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast!\" is now doing weak clean vocals as well as writing whiny lyrics: \"And it makes me glad when I see the sun, and I thank my God, got a friend like you\"...this sounds like some pathetic whine, not sociopolitical criticism or anger. What happened?\n\nThe worst part are arguably the guitars. They're played in the typical n\u00fc-metal style with one riff per song and no guitar solos. As a consequence, there is no need for a lead guitar (and Flynn didn't play one on this album), which brings the album's sonority down. Honestly, this is the point in the album where we can see that Logan Mader was an important member of the band.\n\nThe final verdict over The Burning Red is based on the fact that this album still sounds like Machine Head and still has good songs, even if there are tracks to be avoided here. Other than that, it's buyable if you are indeed a lot into these guys and have no problems with strong n\u00fc-metal-influenced material. If not, stay away.\n",
        "\nThe first thing I\u2019ll say about this album is that the production (which was handled by Mr. Rob Flynn himself) is phenomenal. Coupled with the fact that Machine Head seem to have stumbled across the ultimate metal guitar tone, the production immediately makes \u2026Locust stand out amongst this year's other releases before the music is even considered. Every instrument sits perfectly in the mix, clearly audible but never overbearing. A case could be made that the snare could be turned down a tad, but I dig it.\n\nThe record opens with some good old Rob Flynn a capella, which admittedly doesn\u2019t seem to bring anything much to the album other than sucking the listener in before the devastating opening breakdown of \u201cI Am Hell\u201d kicks in\u2026and there\u2019s that guitar tone I was talking about. The band just sounds so threatening in this moment. The lyrics are a bit silly (\u201ccome take this bloodshed, constant need to kill you\u201d) but Rob Flynn spits them with such venom that is utterly undeniable \u2013 sounding as visceral and pissed off as on previous, spite-filled declarations such as \u201cClenching The Fists\u201d or \u201cAesthetics Of Hate.\u201d The breakdown gives way to the onslaught of \u201cI Am Hell\u201d's main riff and the ensuing thrash dominance.\n\n\u201cBe Still And Know\u201d, along with the album\u2019s title track, are the band at their melodic best \u2013 the former\u2019s crushing middle section another nominee and likely winner of riff of the year. In fact, ...Locust is a much more melodic outing than its predecessor. \u201cDarkness Within\u201d is virtually a power ballad, propelled by its awesomely uplifting chorus, the awesomeness that is Rob Flynn\u2019s vocal tone (I fucking love that man\u2019s voice), and one of the most awesome melodic solos in recent memory (awesome!). Anthemic closer \u201cWho We Are\u201d even features a choir of children and a cheesy power metal section in the middle, complete with the lyric, \u201cInto glory we will ride\u201d, but is such a well-crafted and passionately delivered piece of music that the band not only gets away with it (as perhaps only they could), but completely owns it.\n\n..Locust is a heavier, more melodic (albeit horrendously-titled) album than The Blackening, more in kind with From The Ashes Of Empires, and for all that it lacks the intent and progression that has made it perhaps the most acclaimed metal album of the new millennium, I actually find it to be preferable. I in no way dislike The Blackening, but I have always viewed the \u201cScandalous\u201d and \u201cA Farewell To Arms\u201d to be weaker points on that record, the former a repackaging of the superior \u201cDescend The Shades Of Night\u201d from ..Ashes, another record I prefer over The Blackening. \n\n\u2026Locust, however, is devoid of any. Perhaps \u201cThis Is The End\u201d (that main riff always finds me reminiscent of The Black Dahlia Murder) could be considered the least strong track on the album, but that is only by comparison to the six unparalleled songs that make up the rest of the album.\nIf there is a band out there at the moment with more musical and songwriting talent per head that operate as well as a synchronized whole as Machine Head, then I haven\u2019t heard them (maybe Opeth). As with much of the band\u2019s back catalog, these are the kinds of songs that the band could walk out onto a stage, play, throw down their instruments, and walk off, the unsaid (and unanswered) challenge being \u201cfollow that.\u201d\n",
        "\nWhen one listens to the lines \"The more things change, the more they stay the same\" on the song \"Struck a Nerve\", a feeling of irony comes to mind. After all, Machine Head kept changing and changing through all of their career while still retaining their identity, and this album in no exception at all.\n\nThe More Things Change... is the only album between their glorious masterpiece Burn My Eyes and the highly n\u00fc-metallish The Burning Red. As such, opinions are expectantly polarized in two groups: the ones who say that this album was their last album as the enraged groove thrash band that gave us \"Davidian\" and the ones who say that this was the beginning of their n\u00fc-metallish era that would tragically culminate with 2001's full-fledged disaster Supercharger. From my personal point of view, however, nothing like that happens. This album is positively unrelated to the one that preceded it and to the one that succeeded it. Truth is, the material in question sounds like it was made by a band younger than the Machine Head of 1994. While I would never classify it as n\u00fc-metal, there's a sense of youth close to many alternative metal and grunge bands of the same era. And yes, this album stands below Burn My Eyes. Fault? The fact that Chris Kontos left the band, replaced by Dave McClain (ex-Sacred Reich). While I admire McClain's talent as a drummer, he is undeniably slower and less technical than Kontos. \n\nAs a direct consequence of McClain's entry, much of the technicality that marked Burn My Eyes is lost, replaced by fast hardcore-like moments of speed and angry grooves. While this album is almost as brutal as its predecessor, a major difference can be felt; if 1994's Burn My Eyes is an expression of rage against social disorder, then 1997's The More Things Change... is still an expression of rage, but a different one that's less social and more political. The lyrical themes now center around inner rage and struggle, devoid of any sociopolitical concerns, and the music becomes somehow more accessible...without, however, becoming weaker by any terms.\n\nMusicianship is, as I said before, less technical than in 1994, starting with the drums. The opening track \"Ten Ton Hammer\" shows such changes from the beginning; the sense of precision is somewhat lost. Even in the \u00fcber-fast \"Struck a Nerve\" or in the slow anger of \"The Frontlines\", the listener gets the feeling that the drums are lower in standard than what Kontos used to do. \n\nThe very same feeling continues to an extent in terms of guitar to the point in which the precise grooves of past are replaced by a (successful) attempt at sludge metal (\"Blood of the Zodiac\"). The good point here is that the less technical style actually works to a great extent because Mader and Flynn did not waste the aggression of old (\"The Frontlines\" at 0:40), combining it wisely with the new, grunge-inspired sludges. It's a formula that pretty much works, in fact. Here I admit that some link between their older style and their later style can be felt, however I would not call it important enough. Adam Duce's peculiar (and brutal) bass lines continue to be nearly the same as they were in Burn My Eyes, helping to bring up the decibels (e.g. \"Take My Scars\") when and where they are needed. \n\nRobb Flynn's vocals give the final touch to this album. Ironically, his voice sounds younger in 1997 than it was in 1994, probably because now he uses a more melodic vocal style (\"Ten Ton Hammer\", \"Take My Scars\"), which is still combined with his 1994-ish aggressive thrash metallish yelling as well as his more moderate vocals such as in the verses of \"Spine\". If I had to pick up one of his vocal passages throughout the whole album and elect it as his triumph, I'd definitely pick \"Blood of the Zodiac\", more specifically his last minute of incredible melodious shouting. It may as well be one of his best performances ever.\n\nA lot of controversy will always surround Machine Head, especially since 1999. The constant evolution of their musical style is the main reason, and many of their fans will argue that their first 2 albums were their finest hour, including me to be honest. Other people will say that this album was the beginning of their failure. I must disagree. All they did was pick their groove thrash style and make it more accessible and not necessarily worse. In fact, it features a lot more variety than Burn My Eyes. Machine Head would only fail after this, especially four years after, under the period in which they had Ahrue Luster on guitar. I highly recommend this album to fans of '90s metal/groove thrash and especially to people who are starting to get into metal. It's no Burn My Eyes, but it is still an excellent album.\n",
        "\n1994. Corruption. Racism. Hate. Have no doubts that this is pretty cool. The church has failed. Jesus came down and he cried. That's when a thrashing avalanche of pure metal riffing is coming after you. Machine Head are one of those bands that sadly flawed their careers (not without knowing how to fix it, though), but pointing flaws on their 1994 studio debut Burn My Eyes is a very hard task - it's not by accident that this is one of the most legendary metal albums of all time. Of course, not to undermine Machine Head's impact, but this shouldn't exactly come by surprise considering that this band was formed by musicians which already had a good reputation from other bands - most specifically Robb Flynn of Vio-lence and Chris Kontos of Verbal Abuse. Nonetheless such precedents don't make it less surprising and outstanding.\n\nSonically, Machine Head successfully created a bridge between the intense thrash metal of the late 1980s and early 1990s with the newer groove thrash sound (of which this album would become a classic) and, to some extent, to hardcore as well. The result is an impressively brutal yet street-smart imprint completed by sociopolitical lyrical content which exploits a vast array of themes rangingfrom the 1992 Los Angeles riots to organized religion, not forgetting street violence.\n\nThe bad points of this record? The only thing I can think of is the song \"I'm Your God Now\". It is somewhat uninspired, not to mention that its mood and its lyrical content make it sad and somewhat depressive when compared to the rest of the record. The song was written about a friend of the band who died as a consequence of his substance abuse. While it is indeed nice to see tha band making him a tribute, it sounds a lot like the dark point of a revolted album. \n\nRevolted, yes, because the feeling you have as soon as the legendary opener \"Davidian\" starts playing is that was written by someone who was angry with the system. Everything in this album seems to symbolize anger, rage and revolt against the social disorder of its era, something which is lacking not only in their subsequent output, but also in most of their copycats. One of the main contributors for this overtly aggressive sound is undoubtely Logan Mader, who gives us one of the best guitar solos ever in \"None but My Own\", and alongside with Robb Flynn pulls some of the thrashi riffs in history in \"Block\" and \"Old\" (3:17), contributing to the brutality of the album. But that's not all, Adam Duce's bass also helps a lot with its passages in \"Davidian\", \"Old\" and the beginning of \"Blood for Blood\". Robb Flynn's Phil Anselmo-esque vocals also increase the anger-filled atmosphere, either in the mythological \"Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast\" war cry in \"Davidian\", or the chorus of \"None but My Own\". He also uses cleaner singing and spoken word sections, such as in \"The Rage to Overcome\", \"A Nation on Fire\" and \"Death Church\", increasing the variety of the album while still retaining a general spirit and attitude. \n\nThe drumming in this album is arguably the best on any album Machine Head ever released, courtesy of Chris Kontos, who leads us not only to one of the most brutal breakdowns ever (the end of \"Davidian\"), but also (and this may very well be his finest moment in this record) to the introduction of \"The Rage to Overcome\". His drumming can only be described as excellent and one can be pretty sure that he would influence later drummers. The brutal yet technical nature of the drumming not only completes the album's mood but also created new standards for future metal acts, most of whom would fail to succeed in pulling what Machine Head did.\n\nFinally, one last word on the song \"Real Eyes, Realize, Real Eyes\". It shouldn't be considered a song in its own, as it acts as the introduction for \"Block\" (and in their demo it wasn't a song of its own). However it acts very well as the instrumental song of the album, despite its repetitive riffing, and together with all the sampling on it, this track ends up by synthetizing the record's nature. I still stand that this song and \"Block\" should be in the same track, though.\n\nMachine Head are a band that, due to their musical misfortunes (especially their 2001 disaster) tend to divide opinions: some people say that they are one of the best metal bands on Earth while others will intitule them as sellouts and will say that (in the words of Kerry King) \"they're responsible for rap-metal\". Without wanting to contest any of those opinions (bands don't endure for 20 years out of luck and Machine Head did drop their groove thrash style when it no longer was the current vibe, not to mention they influenced unmeasurable amounts of mediocre me-too acts), and as I said before, this album is not a legend by luck. This album is a legend because it is one of the angriest and most in-your-face metal albums ever. Which means that this is also one of the best metal albums ever. Many tried to reproduce this and failed. This is a recognizable classic of a sometimes underrated era.\n",
        "\nIt's a curious thing, writing off a band as being unworthy of further consideration. Often times it's a safe venture provided one knows what one is looking for, but if not done with a level of care, it can lead one to the awkward state of having to admit error. Even in the case of Machine Head, which is among the safer bands not to bother with if someone is at least attempting to find something resembling thrash metal, surprises are possible. And while it is important not to overstate the incremental improvement in metallic sensibilities, it is with a confident inflection that I say surprise, thy name is \"Unto The Locust\".\n\nThis seventh studio endeavor by Robb Flynn's infamous post Vio-Lence outfit doesn't so much shift gears in overall style as it simply downplays the inherent weaknesses of it while accenting where any strength can be drawn from. This is an album that could be qualified as textbook half-thrash in the sense that it spends almost half the album within the thrash metal paradigm, while the rest sort of dances between the slowed down modernism of \"Burn My Eyes\" and the metalcore tendencies of \"The Blackening\". It ratchets up the technical elements of the latter while paying a level of mind to the clean vocal and ballad-infused tendencies of the former, resulting in something that is eclectic yet fairly organized.\n\nTo put it plainly, when this thing gets going, it cooks with the best of them. A good chunk of the long-winded opener \"I Am Hell\" and the middle song \"This Is The End\" seem to be attempting to resurrect the frenetic tendencies of Vio-Lence with a modern, progressive riff set to spice up the mix. Both of these songs suffer, as much of this album does, for being loaded up with fairly pretentious introductory material such as a hymn-like choral intro featuring Flynn's clean vocals or a drawn out ballad prologue. Thankfully there is nothing on here loaded with minute upon minute of pointless quiet interludes, but all of these songs could do with having the intros cut in half. Nevertheless, while Flynn's clean singing is mediocre and reminiscent of mid-90s Phil Anselmo, his tough guy grunt is reasonably precise and percussive.\n\nThe good points don't end with the thrash elements, but also encompass a superior focus on the strengths of the groove and progressive elements of the band. Even mostly thrash oriented songs like \"Pearls Before Swine\" and \"Who We Are\" (the latter really blows it on the intro material with a goofy children's choir intro, but otherwise is a decent song) sees a chord progression set that is somewhat in line with an older, almost power metal oriented feel to it. The token nod to past groove masterpiece \"Davidian\" in \"Locust\" is more mid-tempo, but loaded up with contrasting elements. To top it off, Demmel and Flynn take every opportunity to tear up the fret board with a series of fill happy bridge riffs and shred happy solos, almost to the point of trying to rival what Megadeth has been doing of late.\n\nWhile I wouldn't quite shout from a mountain top that Machine Head finally found themselves a formula that works, this album actually makes me wonder if I might actually do so in the near future. The primary thing that holds this thing back is a sense of over-ambition on Flynn's part, trying desperately to mix things up as if saying \"Hey look, I can take a solid hybrid of modern groove and old school thrash and turn it upside down with a bunch of classical music gimmicks\". It works for Malmsteen because he has a vocalist that doesn't sound like a pissed off jock turned metal head, but Machine Head should stick to the neck ruining aspects of this sound and only occasionally go into the progressive well. But flawed or not, I can't hate this album, though Flynn still has some work to do before I forget about the rubbish he threw out from the late 90s up until 2004.\n",
        "\nIt's actually phenomenal how i've never hated an album as much as I hate this. This album has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This is your typical post-Supercharger Machine Head album, and that is pretentious, boring and ultimately incredibly unmemorable.\n\nThe album is that unmemorable, that I'm going to struggle writing about it, as there is literally nothing I can remember beyond the horrific breakdowns, the children singing the intro to \"Who We Are\" and Robb Flynn attempting to sing and failing horribly.\n\nBeyond that, nothing stands out. The riffs all blur together in a mesh of groove metal unoriginality, the drumwork is so standard and unimpressive and Robb Flynn is still doing his best impression of a Great Dane (that is, when he's not badly crooning). The bass is inaudible, as can be expected from any metal made this recently. The band are also jumping on the metalcore band wagon and playing those chug-a-lug breakdowns that the Kerrang! reading fanbase love to hear so much. The solos are skillful enough, but do not stand out and are forgotten not long after they finish.\n\nThe children in Who We Are get a whole paragraph to themselves. Whichever band member thought it'd be a good idea to get some children to sing \"THIS IS WHO WE ARE!\" wants kicking out immediately. Just when you think nothing else can drag this album on track 7, they're there to tell you just how wrong you are. They manage to drag this release out of the realm of mediocrity into plain shittiness.\n\nThe main problem with this is that the songs are far too long. If Lamb of God made Redneck 8 minutes long, it would be absolutely tedious. Perhaps these songs would be better if cut down by several minutes. They certainly wouldn't be anywhere near as boring, but they'd still be forgettable.\n\nThis is quite easily one of, if not the worst album i've ever had the misfortune of hearing. Only bother if you're the biggest Machine Head/groove metal fanboy ever. Otherwise, stay the fuck away.\n",
        "\nWow, where the hell did this come from? Machine Head has always been a band that had mediocre albums and for them to release this, is just stunning and makes me happy. To know a band that went from shit to greatness is something that's rare in the metal genre. I'm not saying this is the ultimate release of all time, but it's damn good and ensures you to blare it out of your car over and over again. It's no Eternal Nightmare, but I can honestly say that this is Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel's best release since then. It's not a thrash masterpiece, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nFirst song we have is \"I Am Hell (Sonata in C#). First time I heard this tune I kind of thought to myself, \"What the hell am I listening to?\", but as the song progressed I got more and more hooked. Found myself turning it up louder and louder and when it came to the headbang worthy section at 4:20'ish I had my speakers on full blast. It's an epic tune that has three different sections in it. No more mediocre and repetition from Machine Head. \n\nAs the cd progresses we get more epic tunes. All the songs are the same that they don't really repeat. They are all different in their own way and I found myself not getting bored with them at all. Every song is really brutal, yet catchy and I find myself singing them to myself throughout my day. The choruses for pretty much all the songs are really great. Machine Head is notorious for having very child-like lyrics, but this album acts like they finally became an adult. None of the lyrics are really child-like and you're not embarrassed to sing them to yourself in your off time. In fact, I think this is the second time (second to Blackening) where I am not totally embarrassed to be listening to Machine Head. Everything is really well done in this album; the vocals, drums, and guitars (and solos). None of the solos are really all that fantastic, but they fit the songs perfectly. Just wish I could hear a little more bass on the record.\n\nThere are two reasons that this is not the perfect Machine Head record. The first being the song \"Who We Are\". The intro to the song consists of children singing the chorus to the song in a very painful way. It doesn't sound good at all and when I think about it, it makes me cringe. It only lasts about 30 seconds, but that's enough to dumb down the rating about 5%. It really sucks and shouldn't have been added to the album. The other thing that really blows about this album is the Rush cover \"Witch Hunt\". Robb Flynn can NOT pull off the clean vocals. I like the overall song and mood Machine Head brings to the table, but the vocals are wretched and ruins this, otherwise great sounding, cover. Of course, this song (a kick-fucking-ass Judas Priest cover and an unnecessary acoustic version of the song \"Darkness Within\") is only available on the special edition of the album, so be thankful that you are not hearing this filth. Youtube it if you are that interested, but you'll regret it.\n\nOverall this album is pretty great for a Machine Head record. Flynn's vocals have improved greatly (as long as he's not singing soft) and the songs are insanely catchy and heavy. The songs are written really well and the songs are all different while being the same. Now, as I go on about how great this album is, you guys need to remember that this is great for a Machine Head album. I didn't give it a 90% because I think this is one of the greatest albums of all time, but for Machine Head it's extremely top notch. I know a lot of people either love or hate Machine Head. Whatever your reasons for liking or hating them, I do believe that everyone should give this record a chance. \n\nSong recommendations: I Am Hell, Locust, This is the End, Darkness Within, The Sentinel (if you have SE)\n",
        "\nAnyone who knows me will know that I like my music epic. The more epic the better in my eyes. For me there is nothing finer than 7 minutes or more of huge music; big choruses, enormous riffs, finger shredding guitar solos and drop outs of such magnitude that dance artists can only look on in pure envy.\n\nSo four years ago when Machine (fucking) Head released The Blackening I thought all my Christmases had come at once. Here was an experienced band known for playing the some of the heaviest, brutal metal who had embraced the epic side of things in their songwriting. Songs like Clenching The Fist Of Dissent clocking in at close to 15 minutes took things to the next level for them. It was a superb album, full of emotional, powerful songs which broke the mould that they were stuck in. It was a critical and commercial success for them, leading them to be on tour for over 3 years in support of it. It was their Metallica. So fast forward to 2011 and Robb Flynn and co have had the unenviable task of following it up.\n\nSo here we have it, Unto The Locust in its magnificent splendour. Except unfortunately the splendour isn't as magnificent as I was hoping.\n\nMaybe because The Blackening was such a brilliant album, or that I've been a Machine Head fan for near on the last decade, but I was expecting so much more than this album manages to deliver.\n\nRobb Flynn (vocals, guitar) has said in interviews that \"we just can't write short songs anymore\", which is fair enough, I mean, I find it difficult to keep songs down to 4 minutes when I write, but a couple of the songs on this album feel very forced and I was actually thinking that they could have done with being shorter. Album opener I Am Hell (Sonata In C#) is a prime example of this. It starts with a cultish chant which runs for at least a minute before the song starts proper. It bears no real relevance to the song as a whole and could have quite easily been a separate introduction track entirely. The rest of the song itself is standard MH fare, rapid fire riffs, pounding drums and Robb growling himself into a frenzy. \n\nBefore we go any further, I feel I need to point out that it's not bad. Its still a good album, its just not a great album and certainly not on the same level as The Blackening.\n\nThere are moments of pure MH fuck-you brilliance. Locust and and This Is The End are both inspired songs with some of the best riffing and lyrics ever to come out of the band. The chorus of Locust is going to go down as a new live favourite in the same way that Halo and Aesthetics Of Hate did from the last album. However, the middle section of This Is The End typifies why I love the lyrics in MH songs with the lines \"Bastards/You bastards/May you suffer oh so long\". Just brilliant stuff.\n\nMusically the band are on top form. The riffs are awesome, the guitar solos and dual harmony sections are a master class in how-its-done, the drums are fast, heavy and hard (which appears to be the Dave Mclain trademark), the bass rattles and rumbles in all the right ways and the vocals, be they screamed or sung are powerful and brutal. On paper this should be an amazing album.\n\nRobb and Phil Demmel have such a fantastic bond as guitar players which is evident throughout the seven tracks on offer here. The lead work on the likes of Locust and Darkness Within makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up as it is just phenomenal. From the shred-tastic solos to the huge, no, scratch that, HUGE lead harmony sections, this album is a guitar nerd's dream.\n\nAdam Duce's bass work is once again, superb. Thundering through the tracks like the enormous powerhouse he is, he fits right behind the guitars for the majority of the time, but when the rhythm guitars drop out for the dual lead harmonies then Adam frequently joins in, creating a third harmony point rather than just being a remaining rhythm instrument. It works very well, very well indeed.\n\nMH have always been known for the big riffs but moreover, the massive rhythms. Dave Mclain doesn't disappoint with some of the best work of his career on show. Who We Are is probably the best showcase on this album with multiple tempo and rhythm changes throughout to the point of dropping down to a soft marching snare during the sections with the creepy kids choir (yeah, seriously).\n\nVocally I don't think Robb has ever sounded better. His singing is smooth and emotive, his screaming/growling is punchier and more powerful and he's even added in some death metal style guttural roaring. I Am Hell and Pearls Before The Swine push his voice lower and lower than he's ever been before. It's interesting and certainly on the latter track it works very well. Adam's harmonies with Robb during the clean sections are lush, full and very reminiscent of the kind of vocal work that Alice In Chains used to put out years ago. The build up and chorus for Darkness Within is something entirely special and not to be missed.\n\nPotentially I think I may be being too hard on this album. Like I say before, its not bad, its just not as good as their previous material. Maybe this is because The Blackening was such a brilliant album and I'm setting my expectations far too high, I just can't help but feel that in some places this album is lacking. The opening two tracks simply don't do it for me, whereas the rest of the album is full of brilliant moments but its just not consistent enough.\n\nIts a shame because Unto The Locust is living in the shadow of another album. Had this come out before The Blackening, or had it been from a different band without the rich heritage that Machine Head bring to the table I bet it would have been a contender for a 10 out of 10. As it stands it's not the follow up I was hoping for, but its definitely worth a listen.\n\nListen to: Locust, Darkness Within, This Is The End\n",
        "\nI never listened to Machine Head before The Blackening came out a few years ago. I was into Vio-Lence had my token copy of Eternal Nightmare (an album any thrash metal aficionado should own) but by that point I kind of had outgrown an insensible appetite for thrash metal and had filled myself instead of doses with progressive metal and black metal, usually depending on who I was with at the time. Either way, both parties who I was spending time with tended to despise Machine Head and described them as nothing more than Robb Flynn's latest attempt to try to make some money and milk popular tastes. So I was rather surprised when The Blackening was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is a guitar junkie and loves nothing more than copious amounts of shredding in his music. I would've done a review of the album at that time, but I felt like I had to listen to the rest of Machine Head's discography to gauge it against everything else, especially when so many people I knew absolutely refused to give the album a chance or despised it. That idea was really put away in the back of my mind, until now. \n\nWhat I can tell you now is that do not get, as I call it, \"Blackened\" when it comes to \"The Blackening\". What I mean is, don't let the opinions of others jade you when it comes to this album. Now I know you're thinking \"Isn't that what I should do with all forms of art, music included? Make my own opinions about it?\" Yes but considering the fact that music is being sold as a product and we often have to purchase others music for enjoyment, people now do appreciate a little consumer advice. This is one of those albums that I've heard very little clear middle ground on. People absolutely love this album and consider it the greatest thing since Master of Puppets, or others despise it. So when it comes to The Blackening, that makes it one of the most difficult albums I've ever reviewed. \n\nAfter listening to this album after I got it and listening to it this day, I can recognize why the person who recommended me this album recommended me this album. I didn't at first. His favorite band is Dream Theater and he also worships Symphony X. Bands like Nevermore, Fates Warning, and many similar acts are among his favorite metal bands to listen to. Understandably, I found this odd because, as I had grown to understand, Machine Head was a quite straightforward band musically. I mean, they did put out some seriously mallcore material in the late 1990s and early part of the previous decade before 2003's Ashes to an Empire, and even before that their music was hardly advanced. This brings me into the first stereotype, the first thing you can be \"Blackened\" by, when it comes to The Blackening. Despite what a lot of people will say, The Blackening is a very musically progressive album. No one who has honestly listened to this album can deny that. It may not be the most progressive album, but Machine Head took a big leap of faith here trying out the mixing in of progressive time and some key changes into their music. For the most part, I have to say it works. Machine Head chicanes in and out of some very wickedly complex riffs and drumming patterns before going into a lot of mellow and ambient sections and it all works very well! The band are still heavy and retain a certain edge that not only make the songs sound exciting, they also make them sound shorter. For an album that's rife with quite a few long pieces, they don't really sound that long. A lot of progressive metal bands cannot say that about their songs, and Machine Head really succeeds in this regard very welly. \n\nThe guitars and the drums are really equals on this album. What I love was that both the guitars and drums match each other so well, but there are not many moments where I can say the guitar was following the drums outright or vice versa. The riffs on The Blackening really stand out in that regard, as a lot of these newer American metal bands that play the post-thrash/grove metal stuff that Machine Head plays will frequently go into a lot of one or two chord palm muted chugging to go along with lame double bass plodding. For I'd say over ninety percent of The Blackening, that is the case. Each pick stroke in the riff just seems to hit at you and highlight some grander mood that Machine Head is trying to achieve with each riff. I absolutely love it, it makes the music sound wonderfully powerful and prevents it from falling into a lot of the traps that Machine Head fell into the past. It doesn't sound completely boring, it doesn't sound contrite, and it actually sounds powerful. You throw that in with some very good lead guitar work from Robb and Phil Demmel and you have a very good recipe for success. \n\nWhat also blows me away here is the drum work by Dave McClain. I had heard rumors that McClain was among the most well rounded drummers in metal today, that he had a very good of speed, rhythm, technicality, and feel that few others can get to. What I can tell you after listening to The Blackening is that many of those people are right. His drum work is phenomenal. I can't think of many albums, by any band out there, that had as well rounded and good of a drum performance as this one did. This is an album that I think all aspiring metal drummers must listen to. Because, on The Blackening, the drums don't just blend into the background to hold a rhythm. Nor do they overpower everything and get downright obnoxious. The drum-work on The Blackening is so good that it actually propels the songs and the song moods and atmospheres forward, more so then the guitars do! And with the quality of some of the riffs on here, that is truly a testament as to just how good it is. When you consider all the time changes played at the speeds that they are played at, the poly-rhythms that McClain sometimes gets into, and the creativity he puts in, it really sounds just brutally wonderful. \n\nThis however is when things start to go awry. The one thing that really irks me about The Blackening is Mr. Flynn's vocals. Robb's standard vocals as a whole are really not that bad. They're loud, they sound reasonably angry, and are pretty forceful. There are some pretty catchy moments to here with The Blackening, moments that do make you feel enraged the way that the songs and Robb sound. Many of the choruses are memorable sounding thanks to some catchy vocal patterns. So what is wrong? Well it starts that Mr. Flynn seems to really lack any sense of tonal range at all. Robb can do the pissed off growling/barking pretty well. The more operatic clean vocals on songs like Halo and Now I Lay Thee Down really don't sound bad, they're actually rather good (despite what many people will tell you). But there is absolutely no middle ground between these two styles. I congratulate Robb for adding the clean vocals into Machine Head's music when it came to The Blackening, but really that is about it. So while The Blackening is more vocally varied than anything that came before it in Machine Head's catalog, you have to realize that is not something is very special. And the middle ground between the operatic clean vocals is really really not good at all. Much of the problem is that the middle ground for Robb reveals another weakness for him, that he really only knows how to sing loud. That is an issue that many metal vocalists have, but they compensate for it by not throwing in other styles of vocals into the music. Then you can't even think that all they can do is sing loud, because you don't know what else they can sing! The vocal passages sometimes just sound misplaced, as there are weird chanty and clean sections in parts where I don't think they should be or drag on for far too long, like in Clenching The Fists of Descent and Aesthetics of Hate. \n\nI also take issue with the fact that bassist Adam Duce is barely existent on this album. While The Blackening is a bassy album, I do wonder how much of that low end actually comes from Mr. Duce, and not just the B tuned guitars of Robb and Phil. The bass lines here are pathetically simple, and anyone who knows how to drop tune their bass low enough can play them with their eyes closed. Aside from a small glimpse on the track Halo, you hardly even hear Duce throughout The Blackening. His role is purely supportive and he does very little to make his presence known on this album, and as a fellow bassist that really disappoints me. But then again he is so thin on talent that I sort of question why I even wish he stood out more. \n\n\nWhat really angers me about The Blackening however, are the absolutely awful lyrics. There is no other way to put it, the lyrics on The Blackening are terrible. There are several reasons why. The overall lyrical themes in The Blackening have essentially do with how Robb Flynn saw the USA and the rest of the world in 2007 and he was, well, disgusted with it. That is all good and fun Robb, and normally I would not mind. I love political themed lyrics that make you think about social issues. But the problem with these lyrics are that you get the feeling that Robb is not leaving room for the listener to , but he's rather acting like he knows everything and he's one hundred percent right about everything. Part of that, I will admit, is the lack of tonal and volume variation, but it is also perpetuated by the fact that the lyrics just get downright cheesy. Clenching The Fists of Descent is pretty much this; Bark Bark Bark The Bush Administration lied about Iraq bark bark bark it's all about the oil bark bark bark how could they lie to us? Replace the barking with rapping, and it sounds like a Rage Against The Machine album. It is the same thing on the second Iraq War themed track, A Farewell to Arms. A tad less barking perhaps, but replaced by utterly sympathetic melodramatic crooning. You really get that sense through all the socially themed lyrics on The Blackening. Halo, Machine Head's ode to anti-Christianity, puts this on full display. The lyrics try to make Machine Head sound like some kind of middle of the field anti-christian rebel who is stuck between a reformer and a generally evil person who wants to destroy Christianity in the name of Satan. Pick a side man! \n\nPerhaps the most embarrassing lyrical moment on The Blackening though occurs on it's best song musically, Aesthetics of Hate. The lyrics of this song are, in a nut shell, about stereotyping. Specifically, how Dimebag Darrell Abbott of Pantera fame, was stereotyped by some evangelist Christian as a devil worshiping heretic who was undoubtedly going to hell because of the fact he was a metal musician, after he was murdered. Now I have no problem with tributes to people who died in music, but I do not like it when musicians make such tributes personal. I just could not help thinking \"Get over it Robb! Dimebag is dead and he's not coming back!\" when I listened to this profanity ridden diatribe. That's another issue I have with these lyrics, there is way too much profanity going on! You don't need to swear to sound angry and tough, and I do not understand why Robb felt he needed to do this on The Blackening to get his point across. \n\nI do very much though appreciate the mix on this album. It is a good mix overall. The guitars have a wonderfully bright tone and sound very heavy nonetheless. The bass, while buried, is there and provides that extra meatiness to make sure it does not sound totally stale. The vocals are very clear and right out in front, where they belong. What sounds the best though are the drums. McClain's kit sounds like a drum kit, the cymbals cut amazingly, and I love the double bass sound. A great album in terms of the studio work, and I am very impressed with it. \n\nDon't get blackened by The Blackening. The best way to decide if this is a good album, like any piece of music or work of art, is just go out and experience it for yourself. I can hope that when you do listen to it, you are not completely blackened by the opinions of others who may not give this album a chance, or praise it overtly like it is the second coming of metal christ.\n",
        "\nI don't know much about Machine Head apart of the fact that traditional thrash metal fans usually dislike the band's modern approaches and compare them to Trivium and even Bullet For My Valentine while younger people claim that Machine Head have their own unique and distinctive style and add a fresh breathe to the metal universe. I became curious and decided to check the next album this band would release out and it happens to be \"Unto The Locust\". I didn't have any prejudices and just gave it a try.\n\nOn the positive side, I see that Machine Head always excels when they try out something experimental and courageous. I like the dramatic, almost classical and really atmospheric introduction of the album that leads into the strong and addicting opener \"I Am Hell (Sonata In C#)\" which is a perfect way to open this album. \"Be Still And Know\" has a great acoustic introduction and leads into a groovier track that is quite different from the first track without sounding disconnected or alien to the coherence of the record. Another highlight is the strong and diversified album closer \"Who We Are\" that has a choir of children performing alongside some creepy male vocals which creates an amazing atmosphere. I was also positively surprised by the bonus tracks of the album. The acoustic version of \"Darkness Within\", one of the weaker tracks on the main version, is very fond and should have found its way on the regular record. This song already justifies the purchase of the special edition but the two cover versions of Judas Priest's \"The Sentinel\" and Rush's \"The Sentinel\" are surprisingly well done. They stick to the roots, to the essence of the originals but also have their own distinctive style and atmosphere. That's the way cover songs should always be done and Machine Head really impress me here even though I still prefer the original versions in the end.\n\nThere are many positive points that justify a purchase of this record but there are also some negative ones that keep me away from the purchase for the moment. I really have some problems with the more traditional sounds of Machine Head when they head for metal core patterns or groove metal sounds. Songs like the title track \"Locust\" just fail to create any kind of sensation in me and sound quite redundant to my ears and are way too long to really convince me.\n\nIn the end, I think that I might not be a fan of the band's traditional sounds but whenever they experiment and try out something new, the final result happens to work very well on me. For the moment, there are not yet enough experiments to convince me to purchase this good or even very good record. I know that I would skip too many songs and not give this album enough spins even though half of the songs sound already great to me. I will though definitely keep on following the band's development and hope for an even more progressive and experimental output in the future. As an advice to the old school metal fans that question the quality of this band, I really suggest you to check this record out because it has many great moments and maybe the band is about to reach the climax of their career in one or two records. There as many modern as traditional and progressive elements and this mixture should at least partially please to any open-minded metal maniac out there.\n",
        "\nWhen The Blackening came out 4 years ago, I was slowly but surely exploring the Heavy Metal genre. I remembering discovering Machine Head through the game Rock Band, where Aesthetics Of Hate was available as downloadable content. Soon after I had downloaded the album of which it came, and I loved it for being able to switch the mood with a flick of a finger... or a pick.\n\nFast forward to 2011 and The Blackening is still regularly blasting through my speakers. In the months before the release there was lot's of talk about Unto The Locust. Some expected it to be better than The Blackening, some thought Machine Head would never be able to reach that level of awesomeness again and some just jumped on a bandwagon. While I love The Blackening, I haven't put it on such high a pedestal as some others, and that just might explain my love for Unto The Locust.\n\nI remember listening to the advance mix of Locust a couple of months ago, and I had the same feeling I had when I first heard Aesthetics of Hate. There was so much to listen to it became an assault on my ears. After hearing the entire album multiple times, I still hear sounds, accents, little things, that I hadn't noticed before. This is part of what makes a good album a great album. Being able to go back to it, and still have a feeling of unfamiliarity.\n\nNow, Machine Head could have just made The Blackening Vol. 2 and most would have thought it was a good album. However, they didn't let the success affect their newest effort. Instead of standing still, they clearly have evolved. There are often several different vocals to be heard. Robb alternates nicely between a very aggressive shout and quite beautiful singing.\n\nThe guitars are still as strong as ever. They go from very simple, yet entertaining chuggs, where it's often helped with an interesting drum style, to a more complicated pattern. The combination of heavy chuggs, interesting patterns and harmonics makes for an album that doesn't sound the same song after song.\n\nWhile Locust is a Machine Head as we know it, they also incorporate new instruments and sounds into the new album. The first thing you hear when you put the CD into your CD player is a choir. This is the intro of I Am Hell (Sonata in C#). The first part of this song is purely setting the mood. Something that is too often forgotten in the thrash metal genre. Whilst I think the intro is extremely well done, they save the best for last. Who We Are does not only cary a strong message, it ends with a string quartet. This gives me chills every time I hear it. Not only that, I also have the urge to press the Play-button as soon as the strings fade out.\n\nUnto The Locust has exceeded my expectations in every possible way. If I have to be critical, the bass could have been a bit more prominent in certain songs or sections. I urge everyone to go get this album and let all the details seep in. This will be on my top 10 albums of 2011!\n\nOriginally written for implar.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nI don't get this band and their alleged style of metal, or so I've been told by people who sing their praises. Somewhere between the demise of the 80s thrash scene and the hybridization that took place between many of its remnants and the onslaught of 90s grunge, something got lost in the translation and with maybe a few exceptions, everything the 90s version put forth just sounded like utter trite. I understand why a lot of people like this music, because it manages to be easy and yet convoluted at the same time, though it often comes with the unfortunate tendency of being more heavy than metal. Robb Flynn's fancies are what drive this more than anything else, and his latest fancy of incorporating the popular hybrid of metalcore and melodeath ala Killswitch Engage as heard on \"The Blackening\" endures to this day, though with some noticeable tweaking.\n\n\"Locust\", the first offering of a soon to be everywhere follow up to their alleged return to metal solidarity circa 2007, is something of a different beast from what I remember 4 years prior. The simplistic to the point of comical melodic sensibilities that plague a number of mid 2000s metalcore releases is heavily present here, along with some token groove riffs that are somewhat reminiscent of \"Davidian\" and \"Imperium\" (Flynn's two crowning groove achievements after leaving Vio-Lence), but absent is a lot of the other nonsense that usually tends to drag this band down. There's one recurring clean guitar theme that gets a bit repetitive, but the goofy whispered narrations are gone, and a mercifully short clean vocal section that is only slightly annoying chimes in somewhere after the 2nd chorus. For the most part, Flynn is channeling the typical hardcore meets grooving tough guy shout Anselmo style, par for the course and thankfully free of the even less pleasant additives.\n\nMuch can't be said about the general flow of this song except for that it cooks a little, coasts a bit, and develops in a very slow and formulaic manner. For a song flirting with 8 minute territory, this thing definitely doesn't spend a lot of time meandering around and focuses pretty heavily on repetition, not to mention a pretty drawn out guitar solo. The high point and really the only exceptional part of this culminates in just under 2 minutes of melodic lead interchanges that are fairly technical, though definitely nowhere near the flash of Flynn's and Demmel's duels on \"Eternal Nightmare\". Apart from this, the song has about the same level of excitement as your current Evergrey song, and excluding the vocals, that's actually what this comes dangerously close to sounding like.\n\nIf Machine Head's soon to be released album tends to resemble this song, it will probably be the best thing to come out bearing their name, but it's still pretty well removed from anything I can get excited about. What this has in general catchiness it tends to lack in overall energy, though it is very possible that this is one of a minority of mid-paced songs on something that might be an improved version of the band's rediscovered semi-thrash sound. The fans will love it, I still won't be able to get it, and all will be right with the world again. Then again, I'll wager that \"Unto The Locust\" will be better than Metallica's soon to be released collaboration \"Lulu\"; just a little hunch on my part.\n",
        "\nAs we all know, Machine Head's overall rating isn't that high. Most of their albums are one a low percentage and this album is also a part of that, it may be their best one, but there's nothing stellar about it either. Let's face the fact that this band didn't have a good run as we'd want them to, however it's quite understandable because, like their albums, this band in total didn't make the cut.\n\nWhere to begin? Let's start with Rob Flynn (vocals and rhythm guitar), the James Hetfield wannabe. If he wants to be like present day Hetfield? He's doing a good job. His vocals are just plain terrible, out of key and really bland, on songs like \"Halo\" and \"Aesthetics of Hate\" he did well with harmonic vocals but that's it. To make things easier for the (small) fanbase to understand, he's meant to be a guitar player and not a vocalist, plain and simple. Rob Flynn portrays himself as a badass in this album, or at least tries to, in reality he has a badass reputation of a five year-old school yard bully.He tries way too hard with his metal appearance and presence and I believe it can be done easily, unfortunately trying too hard leads to failure in most cases. My verdict for Flynn is: find a real job and just stop singing all together, please.\n\nI'll admit, the only reason why this album got 50% was because of the songs \"Halo\", \"Aesthetics of Hate\" and \"Slanderous\". They had some really good riffs and licks, the solos on \"Halo\" were good, but on the other two they were sloppy and just plain terrible. I have absolutely no idea what they plan to acheive by adding a \"static\" effect to their shredding, it just leads us to believe that our headphones are broken. It's either an attempt at being different, or it's just because their skill is lacking. Either way, the solos and guitars in general suck because of this, sure there's some skill in the songs mentioned, but the rest just shows how sloppy and lazy they really are. Just play guitar normally like every other band out there.\n\nThe drums were great, I really like them. They were fast, edgy and brutal which is really important in metal music, if you don't have a good drummer it can lead to failure. However, I felt like the drummer was literally carrying the band, making some brutal cymbal slams to make the music sound better and brutal. It's basically like a mask covering the true uglyness of Machine Head, end of story there. The bassist had some good grooves going, he displayed some amateur rumbles and whatever, but he at least did better than the guitars in this album 90% of the time. \n\nI basically downloaded this album expecting great results and just ended up hating the band in the end. This album is nothing but pure disappointment and crappy effects, vocals and solos. You shouldn't buy this album unless you are really into shitty music and enjoy the feeling of disappointment, long story short: these guys are nothing but Metallica wannabes, where the vocalist thinks he's the next (St. Anger era ) James Hetfield and that they have the same song lengths as Metallica (longest song time is approximately 10 minutes long). So if you like the sounds of \"modern Metallica\" and like some pointless angt-filled lyrics, by all means buy it. If not, spend your money on a better album.\n",
        "\nAh, Machine Head. One of the most criticized bands of recent years. Like Metallica before them, they befell the pressures of the mainstream media, and for two consecutively disappointing albums, tortured the ears of saddened fans. Their debut was stunning, a masterpiece of blended genres; Groove-tinged Thrash Metal, with a hint of Industrial thrown in. They then went to release the equally great \u201cThe More Things Change\u2026\u201d, but was all too similar in sound to its predecessor. The band could not have sunk any lower. But then 2003 saw the release of \u201cThrough the Ashes of Empires\u201d. This was Machine Head\u2019s blistering return to greatness. With the addition of Robb Flynn\u2019s former band mate, lead guitarist Phil Demmel, the band had shown the world what it could do. After several very successful tours and a live DVD, Machine Head returned to the studio. Four years wait and anticipation brought the world to 2007, when they released The Blackening\u2026\n\nThe album starts off with the ominous sound of a much distorted call from a mosque. \u201cClenching the Fists of Dissent\u201d begins the album with a quiet and peaceful acoustic riff repeated over, the addition of a snare and Robb Flynn screaming anti-war propaganda in the background builds up the tension. The tension breaks out into one of the most technically mind-blowing riffs Machine Head have ever performed. The bass and drums kick in as Flynn\u2019s scream of \u201cWAR!\u201d launches the listener into a ten minute marvel of Thrash Metal. With finger-melting lead interludes, an almost constant double bass pedal performance from drummer Dave McClain and unforgiving breakdowns, the song fades out leaving the listener\u2019s heart thumping.\n\nTrack number 2, subtly titled \u201cBeautiful Mourning\u201d is no less powerful. With the Flynn\u2019s brutal scream of \u201cFUCK YOU ALL!\u201d opening the track, the pounding drums slow to Flynn\u2019s terrifying vocal performance. The guitar work of Demmel is truly excellent, with a short solo from him sending the song flying from a breakdown straight into the cleanly sung finish.\n\nThe third track, \u201cAesthetics of Hate\u201d, is a true example of how for Machine Head has come through these long years. Beginning with a quite chilling guitar riff that ultimately chases the listener throughout the seven minute thrash attack, sets the scene for this showcase of Demmel and Flynn\u2019s tight guitar work. This song is, at the end of the day, a middle finger to a man who slandered Dimebag Darrell, as well as a tribute to the guitar legend. The lyrics are gut-wrenching and the bass performance is superb throughout. The drums are relentless and skillful. Several solos from the guitarists lead to the flawless cries for divine intervention from Flynn, and the track concludes with an almost \u201cRaining Blood\u201d reminiscent combination of screeching guitars and staggered floor toms.\n\n\u201cNow I Lay Thee Down\u201d is similarly emotive lyrically to \u201cAesthetics of Hate\u201d. They follow a story reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet. Musically, it is incredibly varied, opening with a very soft guitar riff that, like \u201cAesthetics of Hate\u201d, return time and time again throughout the song. The drums are melodic, matching the bass perfectly, and the tap interlude from Demmel is incredible. The solos, however, are the really special things about this song; the two guitarists trade off in a sort-of battle, each turn separated by a rendition of the main riff. The song ends violently after a brilliantly sung bridge.\nThe pick-slide of \u201cSlanderous\u201d, followed by the very technical guitar work, and the complex drums, make this a very memorable track. A five minute thrash attack against racism and prejudice, this is where Machine Head show their controversial lyrical genius. With the several uses of the \u201cN-word\u201d, this song delivers a brutal beat-down to injustice. Once again, the axe-men show their skill, but Demmel\u2019s solos are once again a high point for this song. Concluding with another rendition of the blistering riff in the intro, Machine Head have left the listener breathless.\n\n\u201cHalo\u201d. From the very peaceful intro, to the ultimate, thrashing conclusion, this is the song that Machine Head were born to write. The intro builds at a fast pace, via use of an accelerating double bass pedal, opening up into a technically amazing riff, the guitarists show their skills here. Flynn\u2019s vocal performance is outstanding here, as his screams break out into a very energizing cleanly sung section with bassist Adam Duce. The chorus is sung over an equally memorable high-end riff, and pounding drums and tom rolls. After the second chorus, the song collapses into that chilling intro riff. The breakdown is brutal; Robb Flynn\u2019s screams take the listener by surprise. The drum performance is melodic and precise. But the breakdown ends abruptly; Phil Demmel unleashes the most blistering and mind-blowing solo on the album yet. The drums and bass kick in to follow the lead work through a minute long journey showcasing Phil Demmel\u2019s incredible guitar abilities. With some of the most complex tapping, shredding and sweep picking around, and a staggering dual lead finish to it, the solo in itself is a masterpiece and is probably one of the most intense solos ever recorded. The soft singing of Flynn breaks into an epic finish; with Duce singing, Flynn screaming, the song breaks back into a very Thrashy, and pick-slide filled ride to the end of this nine minute epic.\n\n\u201cWolves\u201d kicks in where \u201cHalo\u201d left off. A blood curdling vocal opening, followed by another awesome lead break from Demmel sets the scene for the rest of the song. The almost constant double bass drumming from McClain is outstanding. The lengthy, but none the less entertaining, instrumental bridge, and leading to another guitar trade off between Demmel and Flynn, the song comes abruptly to a halt, with Flynn\u2019s voice echoing into the distance.\n\nAfter the sonic assault that was \u201cWolves\u201d, one can only hope that the final track from this audio journey would be something somewhat more relaxing. The listener is allowed two and a half minutes of soft singing backed by similarly peaceful guitars and cymbal orientated drum work. But, like the first track of The Blackening, apprehension is slowly becoming stronger, until the song breaks out into a somewhat slower but none the less heavy track. The lyrics are target at the Iraq War, and suit the song perfectly. The singing is, once again, very powerful, and fits in very well with the pounding bass line and guitar work. The song eventually breaks into a brilliant Thrash Metal finish, with a very fast riff, and another very impressive solo from Demmel, with a very heavy focus on complex tapping. The song culminates in the form of staggered floor toms and cymbals, slowing the track from the Thrash Metal guitar work. Flynn\u2019s whispering of the title as the screeching of a guitar fades out, leaving the listener truly impressed.\n\nThis may well be one of the best albums ever recorded, with the quality comparable to that of Master of Puppets. Even if you don\u2019t agree with that, listening to The Blackening will ultimately leave you a changed person. It is such a shame that this phenomenal piece of Metal wasn\u2019t recorded twenty years earlier, for it would\u2019ve put the output of the Big Four at the time to shame. This is an outstanding performance by the whole band. This truly has shown the world what to expect from the Bay Area four-piece, and will make them reconsider ever doubting them. Machine Head have created their masterpiece.\n",
        "\nI like Machine Head. Let's get that out of the way. They aren't my favourite band, they don't even play my favourite genre of music, but I do not understand why this album, nor any of Machine Head's albums (save for a couple) have got such poor review scores. If you are an impartial listener, you should love this album. There's riffs, leads, hooks, and actual songs. Then again, I admit some of the songs are overrated.\n\n'Davidian' for example, gets way more praise than is due. Yeah, I like it when Robb Flynn shouts, \"Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast\" as much as the next guy, but it's not a classic moment. The riffs pound along very nicely and the outro riff is a touch of class in a genre where there isn\u2019t a great deal, though some of the structuring and the solo fail to strike me as amazing as I write this.\n\nWhat we do have on this album though, are several other classic moments. There's 'Old', which has more exciting riffs than most bands manage in an album; there's 'None But My Own' that has a solo that seems to push further and further into the beyond, exceeding itself with every note; there's real brutality on 'Blood For Blood'. It\u2019s this last song particularly that sets Machine Head apart from being \"just groove metal\". Apart from a few bands, a lot of the music lacks real energy: 'Blood For Blood' has a solid opening, which gives the main riff even more venom and comparative speed. Flynn spits out the lyrics and the solo really hits home. As for 'Old', it isn\u2019t quite as vicious but there\u2019s complexity and breezeblock grooves that make me want to get to my feet and slam against the walls. The chorus is lacking in creativity and tune but really doesn\u2019t detract from the onslaught of guitars.\n\nReally, the so-called \"classic\" moments on this album are the weakest. The opener suffers from it a bit, 'Block' isn't all it's cracked up to be, although I wouldn't argue with it in a mosh pit, since it has that sledgehammer riff and a great refrain. 'A Thousand Lies' and 'A Nation On Fire' are both slow to pick up, but really develop into good songs, the latter in particular coming to life as the chorus begins. Another song of note, 'Death Church' has a relatively slow start too, but is just creepy, with a repetitive melody and more emotive lyrics, touching on the alienation and hatred in the Bay Area that Flynn comes back to a couple of times on the album. 'I\u2019m Your God Now' has a similar aesthetic but is far more emotive, with the theme of drug addiction cropping up amid the choking grooves and thick sound.\n\nThe only weakness I can easily pick out on this album is the vocal performance, which, along with the pacing, can just cause the fire to die a bit. Robb Flynn had a fairly good shout, but he's best when he's singing at pace in his gruff voice; really he didn't have the skill to carry a tune in the slow sections in 1994.\n\nBut I like Burn Your Eyes. The production causes the guitars to bite and the groove increase the catchiness factor quite a bit. Although Machine Head got a lot of hate from thrash fans at the time, their debut was a very respectable alternative to some of the moves made at the start of the '90s. Regardless of the stigma against these guys, they're still quickening my pulse with songs like 'Old', 'Blood for Blood', and 'Death Church' 16 years on.\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s a lot on here that will leave a very bitter taste in the mouth of most heavy metal fans. The rapped vocals, the hip hop beats, the \u201cfuck you, muthafucka!\u201d attitude. This is without doubt Machine Head playing nu \u2018metal\u2019, a far cry from the hardcore-meets-Slayer style of their debut, now they worship at the altar of Korn.\n\nBut genre isn\u2019t the same as quality, is it? Whatever genre it is, it still has the potential to be a success. Unfortunately, in this case it isn\u2019t. Supercharger has it\u2019s enjoyable moments: Bulldozer and Trephination are songs that hint at the aggression Machine Head are best at, even if they don\u2019t truly fulfil that promise, and White-Knuckle Blackout and Crashing Around You are good enough to nod along to.\n\nBut those aside, there\u2019s a lot of rubbish to come. American High is just plain annoying, the longer songs like Blank Generation and Only the Names fail to hold interest, and as a whole the album loses steam half way through when the formula grows stale and predictable. I\u2019m also puzzled as to why \u201cHole in the Sky\u201d is on here. Maybe they felt they had to make up for the new style with something by metal gods Black Sabbath? Whatever the reasoning, it doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s mis-matched within the album and loses the charm of the original.\n\nOne thing worth noting that it\u2019s a change to hear nu \u2018metal\u2019 with actual metal content. Most such bands come from non-metal backgrounds, and although there\u2019s a lot of that on Supercharger, it\u2019s also an example of a band with genuine metal influences playing in this style.\n\nBut still, if you are repulsed by all things nu, then stay well away. The hardcore hip hop aggressive bounce, the post-grunge textures, the angst-ridden lyrics, it\u2019s all here, albeit with some mild (groove) metal sound too. Personally, I\u2019ve heard worse albums, but it\u2019s still a flimsy offering from a band that can do better. All told, it becomes apparent by the end that Machine Head are much better roaring their anger than whining about their abusive childhoods.\n",
        "\nMachine Head pretty well solidified their status as a principled adherent to the fine art of trend hopping in the previous 9 years. Be all this as it may, 2001 brought in a rather interesting revelation to those who\u2019ve bothered to follow them, and that is that they aren\u2019t really very good at it. \u201cSupercharger\u201d shows the band actually sticking to their nu-metal guns, in spite of the fact that it did not serve them well among their groove fans, in that it largely failed to rope in a sizable contingent of Durst worshippers. One could perhaps chalk it up to even the consumers of the most decrepit bowel movements of pop culture being able to smell a generic imitator of their preferred cuisine and take the necessary evasive actions.\n\nThis essentially takes the hokier elements of \u201cThe Burning Red\u201d and attempts to mask them with a more complex arrangement and a few bits and pieces of their earlier groove sound, all of which succeed only in turning an offensively banal style of music into a monotonously drawn out, overlong version of itself. Some of these songs literally seem like they're 10 minutes long, in no small part due to the prevalent use of tedious quiet sections with wussy whisper vocals and other assorted nonsensical vocal gesticulations. There are actually sections on \u201cKick You When You\u2019re Down\u201d and \u201cBlank Generation\u201d where Flynn engages in the mallcore version of scat singing, consisting of douche bag ridden imitations of cymbal and guitar scratch noises.\n\nIn spite of all the goofy, Durst inspired rap vocals and gimp squeals, the really culprit that makes this pile of dung beetle munchies unbearable is all the sloppy, effects drenched half-thoughts going on behind them. Sometimes there\u2019ll be overlong, heavily repetitive drones that leave Flynn\u2019s voice way too exposed in \u201cBlank Generation\u201d. At others, there will be overloud bass parts that are tuned down to the point of sheer sonic diarrhea in \u201cTrephination\u201d. Occasionally a whole song of rubbish isn\u2019t even bothered with, such as the grating, 59 second mess of guitar noise that is \u201cBrown Acid\u201d. Surprisingly enough, directionless meandering like this actually holds equal footing with all the usual collections of dry, dumb assed 2 note chug grooves that pretend to be exercises in heaviness.\n\nLike with all purveyances of faux metal, \u201cSupercharger\u201d is not without a few really poor attempts at window dressing. The first and most painfully obvious is the opening riff of \u201cBulldozer\u201d, which sounds like a slowed down and tuned down version of \u201cPainkiller\u201d, but is surrounded with Flynn\u2019s ad lib gibberish and Phil Anselmo influenced crapshoots. It naturally repeats itself into ad nauseam territory quickly and is changed out for the usual mishmash of queefy quiet sections and open note groove dregs. The next example is a really slow, stripped down, and nearly self-plagiarized rehash of the opening riff to \u201cDavidian\u201d to kick off the heavy section of \u201cOnly The Names\u201d, which is surrounded by grungy ballad sections aplenty. There\u2019s also a token guitar solo here and there, held out like a carrot on a fishing rod to Machine Head\u2019s rabbit fans, which they naturally can\u2019t get to since the tyranny of Flynn commands mediocrity and commercial pandering.\n\nAlthough \u201cThe Burning Red\u201d will stand as Machine Head\u2019s worst abomination of a studio album for all time, this holds a near equal place in the annals of nu-metal failure. It is less of a reprehensible fit of auditory torture and more of an annoying pest of an album that can\u2019t be successfully swatted, but the general effect upon the listener is the same. After this Flynn finally buckled under the pressure and left the wastelands for slightly less dead pastures, to the delight of this band\u2019s fan base and the continued indifference of the culture zombies that they were trying to reach from 1999-2001. If nothing else, it teaches us that if the primary focus of music is to maintain a regular presence on MTV, the result is never pretty.\n",
        "\nI remember catching Escape From L.A., the rather lackluster sequel to one of my favorite John Carpenter flicks, a couple weeks ago and that famous clich\u00e9 line Kurt Russell keeps repeating about how \u201cThe More Things Change\u201d, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice a huge parallel between that film and this rather unfortunate album. Unlike \u201cEscape From New York\u201d, \u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d was not a terribly enjoyable experience, but otherwise the analogy fits quite well. Regardless to whether or not Robb Flynn lifted the title for this off of that quote, essentially you\u2019ve got the same story, but without the power of a few generally good ideas. This sounds like a watered down, dumbed down, less metallic version of the overt mishmash of Pantera grooves and \u201cSound Of White Noise\u201d atmosphere, with more of the flaws and less of the charms to boot.\n\nSome are pretty quick to start pointing out the KoRn influences, but objectively speaking, this isn\u2019t a whole lot more mallcore sounding than the previous release, which will become the case upon the advent of future releases. There is a tiny bit more reliance on poorly placed harmonic notes to give that irritating, nails on a chalkboard sound associated with the various enemies of metal. We also have a really obvious rip-off of the aforementioned mallcore pioneers first radio hit \u201cBlind\u201d in \u201cStruck A Nerve\u201d, which copies the general riffing concept of the former, but superimposes it on a groove based format where the guitars have slightly, and I emphasize slightly, more gusto to them. But the principle offender here for all those wanting something metal-based is still that grungy goodness that all of the sweaty lawnmower men get off to, particularly the cases of Flynn\u2019s really cheap John Bush imitation clean vocals and on those slow atmospheric sections where the groove shifts completely to the drums and the bass, while the guitars all but fade into an ether of limp-wristed chord outlines. \n\nThe primary thing that really sinks this album is the lack of distinction between songs, as the band keeps going back to the same well of 2 or 3 ideas over and over. A couple songs like \u201cTen Ton Hammer\u201d, which falls short of what its name implies by about 9.5 tons, make vain attempts at incorporating elements of what gave the first couple of songs on \u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d a little bit of punch, but they tend to fall into the same trap of morphing into softball grunge rock at key points, and put a lot more emphasis on banal, 2 note rhythmic drones, rather than finding a signature riff like the one that kicks off \u201cDavidian\u201d and really ramming the point home. \u201cViolate\u201d and \u201cBlood Of The Zodiac\u201d are served slightly better by being longer in length and managing to find a few good ideas in their epic meandering. What emerges from these ventures a tiny bit closer to sludge territory ala Crowbar, which is a step up, but still well below where it could be. Ultimately, listening to this entire album is an exercise in differentiating between the weak and the utterly atrocious moments, though generally things tend more towards the former.\n\nThis can still be categorized as groove metal, though it sometimes has trouble maintaining the second half of that label. There\u2019s a few good guitar solos here and there that avoid the wretched, effects smothered drivel put out by Sepultura at around this juncture, but they become fewer and farther between than were the case 3 years prior to this. If nothing else, it indicates that Flynn seems to have the desire to fully jump on board with the rest of the Fred Durst crowd, but just can\u2019t quite make the plunge at this point. As the Escape From L.A. quote goes, \u201cThe more things change, the more they stay the same\u201d, and here the resulting sameness is another mediocre offering from a band that is changing in its levels of bringing on the boredom. There\u2019s nothing more to see here, so please move along.\n",
        "\nThere has been this long enduring clich\u00e9 among many fans of this band, and other bands that have allegedly declined musically, that their early work is where one ought to go to get the proper listening experience. Generally speaking, while this sentiment holds true to an extent for Machine Head ( if you discount their 2007 offering \u201cThe Blackening\u201d ), the sad truth is that there wasn\u2019t really much to this band from the beginning. In many other cases where the sentiment is that the early works are superior, this consequential lack of an actual greatness in the band\u2019s origin also tends to hold true. But \u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d holds a unique position as being one of the most blatant testimonies of a band\u2019s inherent inability to break away from mediocrity even when at their best.\n\nOne could probably assert that the problem lays in the groove metal style itself, as it tends to lend itself to a very monotonous mixture of hypnotic riff fragments, nearly redundant restatements of said fragments guising as points of contrast, and a really pedestrian pseudo-tough guy vocal approach that became clich\u00e9 a year before this came out. Robb Flynn seems all too happy not only to embrace every aspect of this trend, which was very well established circa 1994, but to exaggerate them well beyond what even Anthrax and Pantera were seemingly willing to at the time. His vocal presentation here definitely tends much closer to John Bush than Phil Anselmo, though some obvious allusions to the latter are on full display when he tries to dirty up his voice in an attempt to sound as heavy as Hetfield did on \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d. Likewise, the building blocks of the grungy rock character of \u201cSound Of White Noise\u201d and the hyper-repetitive 3 note chug lines with the frequent and very annoying guitar screams of \u201cVulgar Display Of Power\u201d are littered all over most of these songs.\n\nBut in spite of Flynn\u2019s wildly unoriginal incorporation of the flavors of the post-thrash 90s, the collective strength and metallic nature of \u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d slightly edges out the 2 chief aforementioned influences on it. Flynn actually manages to craft a few solid songs here and there that come somewhat close to an \u201cI Hear Black\u201d sound, taking care both not to over-indulge in lead guitar work to compensate for the watered down riffs as Dimebag Darrel did, nor become a slouch at soloing as Dan Spitz did at the behest of the grunge loving media and promotion whores. The principle winner in the lot is the album\u2019s opener \u201cDavidian\u201d, which listens like a heavily down-tuned and slower progression from Vio-lence\u2019s sound on \u201cNothing To Gain\u201d. There\u2019s just enough differing riffs and attitude to the vocal delivery without becoming either Grungy or goofy, meshed with a tasteful mix of groovy and double bass happy drumming to make this flirt enough with thrash to actually earn a title such as half-thrash. \n\nSadly, not long after the close of the lone Machine Head classic, things start to slip away from any semblance of true aggression. \u201cOld\u201d does contain a similar set of simple yet hard hitting and animated riffs as that of \u201cDavidian\u201d, but Flynn\u2019s infamous Bush-inspired clean voice destroys the mood set by the guitars every time the chorus sets in. \u201cA Thousand Lies\u201d also starts off somewhat promising, but deteriorates into a semi-rapped precursor to Limp Bizkit during the verses, though it redeems itself during the solo section where a ratcheted up speed metal section comes seemingly out of nowhere. Basically after this the album deteriorates into a night of the living half-ballads for much of the remaining duration, as the clean guitars and clean vocals usher in a really bland attempt at Alice In Chains worship. There are a couple of fairly decent songs such as the mid-tempo crusher \u201cThe Rage To Overcome\u201d and the speed fest \u201cBlood For Blood\u201d, but they generally tend to either overindulge on guitar screams or bad clean vocals.\n\nTo recap my initial point, there is no mysteriously great beginning point for Machine Head, just a displaced member of the Bay Area scene who decided to turn with the winds of media opinion. What he brings to the table contains elements of what would later become nu-metal, including the addiction to down tuning to compensate for a lack of inherent heaviness in the riff work, something which even Pantera didn\u2019t delve too heavily into at this point. Though it does carry remnants of the older style, it is easy to see where bands like DevilDriver and Slipknot got their influences from. Many may protest this assertion, but the comparison becomes pretty obvious upon closer review. Speaking for myself, at it\u2019s best, \u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d is a continuing reminder as to why this style of metal bores the hell out of me, and while I can\u2019t quite hate it as I do their later releases, there isn\u2019t really enough for me to like in order to put it on any kind of a pedestal, let alone the one that many have put it on.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 18, 2010.\n",
        "\nFor as long as they've been around, Machine Head have usually sought to enter into the current \"all the rage\" trend in heavy metal. While this turns several people off, also helping to fuel the legions of detractors determined to bash anything this band puts out, they often manage to put an interesting take on the music they're creating. As is always worth mentioning concerning my love/hate relationship with this band, I do not care who they are or who they were, I am more concerned with the musical product delivered. \n\nWith that being said, I know for a fact that \"Through the Ashes of Empires\" was a stunt to regain the band's credibility. After the horribly sub-par misadventures in mallcore, it would seem necessary the band return to their \"roots\" so to speak, though I don't see this album mimicing what good elements \"Burn My Eyes\" had on display. In fact, \"Through the Ashes of Empires\" seems to have more in common in terms of quality music with \"The More Things Change...\" though I'd argue this album is more focused in terms of songwriting but still trapped in mediocrity.\n\n\"Imperium\" as it has been noted, is probably the best song here. It runs with some decent ideas for most of its duration and gives the listener false hope that this might actually lead to an enjoyable experience. The same thing is offered in \"Left Unfinished,\" though that song portrays a weaker vocal job from Rob Flynn, who has made an inexcusable lack of effort on his part all too obvious for the majority of his performance. This is seen very well in \"Bite the Bullet,\" a catchy number that shows stubborn determination to keep the mallcore stop-go riffing in place. Its actually a quite decent tune, besides the fact its repeated too much and Flynn goes bouncing around with the usual mallcore yells.\n\nThere is a hint of ambition within this album, something Machine Head haven't really possessed since 1994. This is seen in \"Vim,\" which offers some decent lead work courtesy of Phil Demmel, whose replacing of Ahrue Luster (one of the reasons \"The Burning Red\" ever came into being) had me tickled pink. Unfortunately, Demmel doesn't much at all, really and that part left me disappointed. Sure he pops up for some decent work here and there, but his inclusion on this album is sorely lacking and not even what he contributes save this listen from becoming a listen that causes the listener to say \"meh\" instead of saying \"wow.\"\n\nI see the overall problem with this album is its Machine Head's way to establishing the credibility they had lost over the previous five years. I all too often hear \"Through the Ashes of Empires\" trying to impress the listener with some ambitious ideas and more interesting songwriting, but ultimately falling flat in the process. \"Burn My Eyes\" was able to capture that ambitious spirit and create something rather decent. Hell, even \"The More Things Change...\" managed to be superior to this album, largely because despite all the meandering of that album it did not masquerade as anything but a mediocre groove metal album. \"Through the Ashes of Empires\" is basically just that, with more speed elements thrown in and still clings to some mallcore territory, yet it seems to attempt to trick the listener into believing its more. \n\nIn the end, this album is pretty much forgettable since everything here has already been done either on \"The More Things Change\" or \"The Blackening,\" only done better. If you already own those albums, you might as well forget about this one. It is better than the two that preceeded it, but as the tired saying goes this isn't saying much. I can see Machine Head diehards eating this up, but being a fan myself I couldn't really stand any more than about four listens, and those were in hopes the experience would improve with repeated listens. I can state for the record that this album's standing has not improved with me over time and I suggest anyone but the Machine Head loyalist skip it and seek out their better work.\n",
        "\nOn the review I wrote for \"Burn My Eyes,\" I mentioned in the very first paragraph the unusual take on Machine Head's music by the metal world. As I said on that review, Machine Head is generally both overrated by the fans and overcriticized by the detractors with few taking the middle ground. No album in this band's recorded history makes this statement any louder than \"The Blackening.\" Naturally, as with most big names in the States, this album was hyped up a storm upon its release and remains so even now over two years after its release. Heralded as something of a \"triumphant return to thrash,\" I particularly see that it is certainly not, but more of a combination of numerous influences and styles to create a different kind of Machine Head.\n\nJust as it was overrated by various media stations and fanboys giddy with excitement, so has it become a favored target of the usual Machine Head hate crowd. I'm guessing since it bears the name \"Machine Head,\" its worth mockery and downtrodding, and I have little right to rain on that particular parade. I, however, attempt to formulate an opinion about a certain album and band based entirely on the music on display, not who a band is, who they were, or who it is that makes up the bulk of their listening audience. Combine that with the fact that I long ago realized this band was not a thrash band, regardless of terms like \"post-thrash\" and \"half-thrash,\" I have since begun to enjoy Machine Head's music. Since I do not rubber stamp bands, and usually take them for what they are, it allows me to enjoy the music at hand, as opposed to writing this album off as a thrash metal parody, a concept of which is particularly misguided considering this album has little to do with thrash anyway. \n\nAll of that being said, I would also be remiss if I didn't take a particular stand on this album. I don't see \"The Blackening\" as revolutionary, nor the new face of thrash metal, because again folks, this isn't a thrash album. Instead, I see Machine Head grabbing at a new concept of songwriting and in the end finding new directions for creativity but also finding a few dead-ends. To this end, I point to the excessively long song durations. Apparently, as of the last few years, if a band can pull some 7 or 8 minute songs out of their asses they are suddenly branded as a \"pioneering\" force in heavy metal music. Opeth has been doing it for years, and regardless of the actual quality of their albums, they are still seen as absolutely stunning. More notable would be Metallica, who proceeded to wow audiences with excessive song lengths on \"Death Magnetic,\" and bathed in the undeserved praise for what was an otherwise halfway decent album. \"The Blackening\" suffers from this same issue, but I'd argue comes off a little less half-assed than \"Death Magnetic.\"\n\nAn example of excessive lengths comes right from the get go on \"Clenching the Fists of Dissent.\" After the clean guitar sections, the song itself cooks relatively well and establishes itself as one of the best songs here. You get a few thrashier sections, a quiet section, some post-thrash sections that remind me of \"Burn My Eyes\" to some degree. I personally would love a slimmer version of this song, but for what it is, I can't honestly complain as its fairly decent given the current status of American heavy metal. \"Aesthetics of Hate\" also pumps some adrenaline into the fray, albeit with some useless sections that come in but ultimately don't ruin the listen as a whole. That seems to be a recurring theme on this album; excessive song lengths with good parts, even some great ones, but a load of unnecessary breakdowns and metalcore tendencies or other pointless sections that come in and damage the quality of the songs.\n\n\"Now I Lay Thee Down\" continues with some good moments, but again a little too long. The only song I can't honestly complain about would be \"Slanderous,\" which fires on all cylinders and comes the closest to this album's supposed \"thrash metal\" style. It still doesn't quite get there entirely, but it comes pretty damn close. Not surprisingly, \"Slanderous\" is one of the best songs on here and is only a little more than five minutes in length. Another excellent track that doesn't seem to suffer from those overlong durations would be \"Wolves,\" which comes out on top of most of what is on display here. The good songs here definitely help to stem the tide of mediocrity considering the Metallica cover in \"Battery,\" which suffers tremedously thanks to Flynn's sub-par vocal performance which effectively ruins the cover. It seems strange that Flynn would pick that song, as if it hasn't been covered enough already. If the band being covered had to be Metallica, a song off \"Ride the Lightning\" would have been far more acceptable than one chosen off the \"Master of Puppets\" album, which was obviously done so the majority of listeners would recognize the song title.\n\nMy final verdict is that \"The Blackening\" should not be placed on a pedestal and crowned as some remarkable achievement. At the same time, I don't see it fit to crush this album beneath a nine pound hammer. There is some good quality music on display here, but the misguided concept of \"long songs make epic songs\" is in full force here and as usual falls flat on some occasions. Still, I can't blame this band for trying as their successes often outweigh the majority of the American metal scene, not to mention the majority of famous band names they share the tabloids with. What \"The Blackening\" ultimately amounts to is a respectable attempt at a new direction for Machine Head, one that paradoxically is both superior to \"Burn My Eyes\" but then seems to be inferior since the band was concise and confident on that album and not so much here. In the end, \"The Blackening\" is something of a sign to me that Machine Head is evolving for the better, but they haven't latched onto something truly spectacular yet, regardless of what the media would have us believe.\n",
        "\nMachine Head has been an arguably infamous band since their 1999 album The Burning Red, when they grouped with nu-metal tycoon Ross Robinson and attempted to do rap metal. Luckily for the fans, 2004 album Through the Ashes of Empires was a sort of homecoming to their half-thrash/groove metal. Expectations were mixed: while some optimistic fans assured they would be even more metal-Oriented on their 2007 release, The Blackening, others said they would eventually return to their nu-metal Era.\n\nMy expectations were mixed before hearing the album. During the first minute of \"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\" the album's first track, I was confused, for it seemed that they had nu-metal Elements as well as groove metal ones. I was certainly proven wrong in the next 9 minutes. The first track wasn't at all a nu-metal track, but an energic 10 minute song about revolution. The revolution theme would be present all along the album, along with murder and war themes. Rob Flynn has overcomed his outstanding performance in \"Through the Ashes...\" and become an even more solid frontman, in a performance that seems to say that he's no longer the \"pseudo-rapper\" he used to be in The Burning Red-Supercharger era. The energy and rage present in the first track is also present in the next 2 tracks. Flynn absolutely knows how to put emotions of anger into the songs, even though the lyrics they sing aren't quite smart as one would expect (Beautiful Mourning, Wolves and Slanderous are proofs of that).\n\nNow I Lay Thee Down is a bizarre but exquisite song about love & murder, Aesthetics of Hate is a homage to Pantera's guitarist Dimebag Darrell and also a response to a defaming article a journalist made about him; Halo is an anti-religion declaration which is kind of dull at the beginning but very passionate at the end, and Wolves is an overlong but still kind of entertaining song about war. They surely don't have the best lyrics, but that comes to be irrelevant compared to the virtuosity they have while playing those songs. Flynn's not alone at putting feeling to their themes. Phil Demmel's distortioned guitar riffs fit perfectly into the songs atmosphere. Dave McClain's drumming doesn't dissappoint either, as he's always proven the talent he has since \"The More Things Change\". Adam Duce isn't quite present in the album as the other 3 integrants, but he's still a good bassist throughout the album.\n\nThe way the album itself goes it's really good. It begins with an energizing tracks trio, and then becomes a little bit slower but keeping the heavyness of the first three tracks. The way the album ends, however, is in my opinion an utter masterpiece. A Farewell to Arms not only has the lyric deepness the rest of the album is lacking of, but is also the best way to end the album, with a mixing of softness and heavyness in a single song.\n\nOverall, The Blackening surprised me, because although I thought Machine Head would do another groove metal album like their first album Burn My Eyes, I never imagined that it would surpass it in almost everything, from the sound quality to the way these guys play their instrument. Hopes are high for their next album, because in my opinion, the Blackening has been not also the ratification of their comeback to groove metal, but the best effort they've come up with in nearly 20 years of their career.\n",
        "\nThere is a strange realm in the world of music, particularly in metal, in which there is no true middle ground over fan reaction to a certain band. Machine Head exists almost completely in this inbetween world. Their fans generally overhype them and their detractors usually overcriticize them. There is no \"well, maybe\" or \"kinda, but not completely\" responses. Either you love or hate this band, which seems to be the truth behind most listeners out there, as one could guess by looking at the scores of this album.\n\nI, for one, do not label bands based on style nor past releases. I do not generally hop onto the group bashing bandwagon, unless they truly deserve it (*cough* Metallica *cough*, excuse me.) Machine Head is an irony of sorts, as they do not deserve most of the media praise they get, nor do they deserve to be ripped a new by every other person on the planet. Sure, they made alot of terrible decisions in their time, such as following trends that led to mediocrity spewing forth like a busted sewer line. Still, this band has released some worthwhile music in their time, just not always stellar albums.\n\nThe media has this fascination with dubbing each and every \"post-thrash\" band in the 90's and today as a thrash band. I honestly think this is where most of the heated criticism comes from, as thrash fans are up in arms over a slowed down, simpler band being paraded around by media critics and are proclaimed to be new, revitalizing acts of the thrash metal world. Keep in mind that these are the same media hacks who drew up the totally bogus topic of the \"Big 4\" of American thrash. In reality, all of those four bands were challenged and even overcome at some point by various lesser known groups. Yet to drive the point home, I completely agree with translucent2you and Flid_Merchant in stating that this is not a thrash metal album. Hell, \"Countdown to Extinction\" has more thrash influences than this. \n\nWhat \"Burn My Eyes\" does offer is a bridging gap between 80's thrash and 90's groove. The riffs are still respectable, and there are enough variations in the songs to keep them interesting. Things tend to be more melodic during the longer songs, making them more melancholic than the shorter songs, but again the energy shifts help keep things together. Rob Flynn's baritone singing voice sounds fresh thanks to the production quality, which is well done but still maintains a bit of an edge. I know one thing, Flynn's singing is a hell of a lot more tolerable than Anselmo's death grunts in a megaphone sound on \"Far Beyond Driven,\" released this same year.\n\nWe start this off with \"Davidian,\" which quickly establishes itself as one of the better songs here. As a groove metal song, it works on all levels and tops everything Pantera was doing at this point in time. \"Old\" is a similiar story, more mid-tempo work, and kicks up with more energy than most things that were happening on \"Far Beyond Driven.\" After that song in particular, we kick into a number of longer songs that exhibit the structural changes I spoke of earlier. \"A Thousand Lies,\" \"None But My Own,\" \"Death Church,\" \"A Nation on Fire,\" and \"I'm Your God Now\" all fall into this category. None of these songs are bad, though \"I'm Your God Now\" does begin to wear out its welcome and is one of the lesser tracks here. \"A Nation on Fire\" is the best of these, slowly building until a thrashy ending. For those who like \"The More Things Change...\" it reminds heavily of the song \"Violate,\" but it gets to the point quicker and doesn't choose to meander for six minutes.\n\nOne of my favorite songs here is \"Blood for Blood.\" I have a feeling if this entire album consisted of songs like this, people wouldn't have such a negative reaction to it. That song isn't epic, like something off \"Darkness Descends\" was, but its respectable thrash metal. The riffset is simplified, as is the usual story here, but it works nonetheless. The ending in \"Block\" in more mid-tempo in the same vein as \"Davidian\" and \"Old,\" though it comes out better than the latter song. \n\nAt the end of the day, I still like this album. I discovered rather late in my plunge into metal, but still latched onto it nonetheless. I don't get alot of the criticisms thrown at this album, but I see it comes largely because it isn't thrash, again pointing to my analysis earlier in this review. \"Burn My Eyes\" should not be judged as a thrash album, it should be judged as a \"post-thrash\" album where it truly belongs. In that scope of things, it comes out considerably higher than \"Far Beyond Driven\" did, which was hounded by constant repetition and a lack of ideas. Its actually more comparable to Testament's \"Low,\" as both albums have a similiar context, though I'd argue the songs here are slightly better. If you enjoyed that album, chances are, you'll enjoy this one. Just don't get caught on that thought that this is a pure thrash album, as nothing could be further from the truth.\n",
        "\nBay Area metal band Machine Head came onto the scene pretty strong in 1994 with their debut Burn My Eyes. It became a success in Europe and America, and the band even recieved praise from Kerry King (something he would rescind a few years later.) It only seems natural that Machine Head would seek to duplicate this sound, as if it worked once, and it will work again. \n\nThe problem with The More Things Change is that it is caught between two worlds. On one side, we have Burn My Eyes, which was a solid post-thrash offering. On the other side, we have a gravitational pull towards mallcore, which drags down the album considerably though this is not to be confused with nu-metal. Some stylistic commonalities are there, such as more bass prominence in the mix, though the bass itself is never degraded to that slap bass technique nu-metal is known. Another problem is the guitar tone of the album, which is horribly muddy. This was a common thing in the 90's, as a number of bands did this, including Ronnie James Dio on \"Institutional Man\" a year before. It creates an interesting sound, albeit one that grows tiring after about seven minutes into the album.\n\nConcerning the music offered, we have three categories of songs. Each of these categories contain roughly the same number of songs, although the last one I'll discuss has four. Since that one in particular is the lesser of the three, you can imagine the end score isn't going to be spectacular.\n\nThe first category are those songs that scale back ambitions and long winded song lengths. These songs work the best, exactly the same way Burn My Eyes played out. \"Ten Ton Hammer\" is the first, and the lesser of these three and showcases the added melody in the band's music. \"Take My Scars\" begins with that awful introduction but otherwise plays out in good fashion. \"Blistering\" is the last of these, and again, establishes itself as one of the better songs here. Even with these three, its apparent Rob Flynn's baritone singing voice is both forced and strained, as it does not come off as fresh as it did before.\n\nThe next category are those songs that are longer and/or have obvious flaws in them. \"Spine\" comes to mind here, as its a good song with more energetic moments but it comes off sounding like a medley of two unrelated songs. This is bridged only by a mid-section that meanders a bit much. \"Violate\" is different and slightly better, as it slowly builds over seven minutes to a thrashy end section. This plays out very similarly to how \"A Nation on Fire\" did on the debut, albeit it takes too long to get there. \"Bay of Pigs\" is a thrashier number and shorter, but it sounds rushed and fails to grab me in the way \"Blood for Blood\" did.\n\nThe final category is the least of these and unfortunately holds the most songs. \"Struck A Nerve\" belongs here, as it is the most disappointing track. It begins well, starts to manifest itself into something worthwhile then simply ends. To boot, Flynn's \"come on, come on, come on\" is hovering awfully close to mallcore tough guy posturing. \"Down to None\" is a complete throwaway, it meanders and never becomes anything worthwhile. \"The Frontlines\" is slightly better, but again, nothing worthwhile. The closer in \"Blood of the Zodiac\" also fits here, and while its better than the other three in this particular category, it too suffers from structural meandering. I generally like it when closers add a final sense of climactic energy in a song, or better yet when it compiles previous songs' ideas into something of a well written mixture of the album itself. \"Blood of the Zodiac\" does this to some extent, but given that this album is marked by a decline in songwriting and stagnation, its no wonder the song ended up like this.\n\nI can't throw this album under the bus as it has some redeeming moments. I tend to enjoy some of these songs still, although as a whole I don't listen to it much. The problem is simply that Machine Head was torn in two different directions here, looking for something new while wanting to remain in a comfort zone. Such outings rarely manifest into anything incredible, unless well written and executed, which this is obviously not. For fans of Machine Head and/or post-thrash, this is something to look into just be wary of the flaws I mentioned earlier in this review. Its still a good album, but its far from anything excellent.\n\nTops: \"Ten Ton Hammer,\" \"Take My Scars,\" \"Blistering\"\n",
        "\nI have listened to Machine Head in the past and never caught onto why there are so many people who fellate them. Not necessarily on the Metal-Archives, as anyone can see their albums are not rated very highly, but what I am talking about is your average discreet metal listener who says they listen to all types of music but in reality all they listen to is things on the radio. Since Machine Head seemed to have been formulating the nu-metal sound from their very beginning I can see why they do get a lot of praise.\n\nOne problem that is bothering me though is the heavy similarity to Pantera. Now I am one who loves Pantera, as one of my first metal bands I really listened to there is nothing better than hearing 5 Minutes Alone blasting out of my speakers. This may turn a lot of \u201cpure\u201d metalheads away from this review, but seeing since if you don\u2019t like Pantera at all you are an idiot I don\u2019t care about you. The main reason why it is bothering me so much is because even though it does sound like Pantera, it is a really really bad Pantera. As a matter of fact this album sounds pretty close to the likes of Damageplan, and we all know Damageplan isn\u2019t very good. So with the boring ripped of sound of Pantera and the beginnings of nu-metal you add the vocals from Flynn that have absolutely no power to them. If you have ever heard Zakk Wylde sing I think you may know what I am talking about, cool sounding voice, bad nasally sound, no effort, bad lyrics, ridiculously repeating parts of songs over and over and you get any son on this album.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the songs on the album are ridiculously bad or anything, it is just that they are so boring that they could not be improved without scratching the whole thing and starting over. The simple minded discreet metalheads are the ones who listen to this music, they don\u2019t listen to anything more extreme such as Suffocation or Obituary at the time, and they probably listen to a lot of Slipknot, Mudvayne, Fear Factory, and Pantera. As much as I dislike putting Fear factory and Pantera on that list it is true, the fans of later day Fear Factory and Pantera listen to nu-metal. Now being a former fan of Slipknot and Mudvayne and growing up in the time when these bands really prospered, the real nu-metallers were surely the type of people who made this band survive. Well that and they were on RoadRunner. They were the record label responsible for signing many nu-metal acts; this means that if bands like this had not been on a record label that was a major label this music may have died a long time ago because it is not good.\n\nWhile Flynn is doing his best half ass attempt Phil Anselmo impression and his half ass attempt at creating a groove/thrash album he does seem to have redeeming qualities in guitar playing. These redeeming qualities are the solos, yet still half assed like the rest of the music they are still enjoyable. It seemed more than going after a groove/thrash album; Flynn was going after a tough guy album. With all the mellow parts it seems as if he was still confused on what he wanted to do. Overall in a tough guy album there usually aren\u2019t a lot of things that stand out, except when you get to the breakdowns. Hence the problem with the current deathcore scene, but that is a completely different problem.\n\nI guess around this time though bands were going for the tough guy sound, this was about the time when the first Ko\u042fn album came out, Sepultura\u2019s Chaos A.D., Exhorder and Pantera were popular. With the popularity of this music on the rise more thrash bands jumped on the groove metal bandwagon causing fans to like it more because seasoned veterans were joining the mix of completely uninspired unoriginal music. But just to think at the turn of the decade four of my favorite albums ever were released; Rust in Fucking Peace, Cause of Fucking Death, Seasons in the Fucking Abyss, and Fucking Painkiller. Now what caused such a turn around? Money. This music is more appealing to the average younger radio listener, hence why I liked this stuff when I was 13-16. I didn\u2019t have a lot of access to the internet until about the age of 16 when I started to discover how good music could actually get. Now as we can all see today what is tolerable on the radio is still the more popular and more profitable music. Slipknot is headlining tours and has been on tours with Machine Head. So this brings me to what the music really is.\n\nThe music is simply a thrash album that cannot hold up its britches. In other words a thrash album where the musicians are just too fucking lazy to think of anything creative to write. Not even a large amount of solos or creative solos at that. I know I said that may be the only redeeming part of the album and that is because it is simply the only parts that do not make me want to fall asleep. The songs are all drawn on too long, I guess it makes it easier for the radio listener to pay attention and follow along. The breakdowns allowed the tough guys to tighten their bandanas and rip their wife beaters in the mosh pits to make themselves feel even tougher while jumping around like little monkeys. Listening to an album like this again makes me happy I never went a Machine Head or Slipknot concert because of the style of people that are there. Once again this is the problem with deathcore. Just like in deathcore Machine Head has implemented the use of breakdowns\u2026just for the sake of having fucking breakdowns. Absolutely no point to them, as if things were not slow efuckingnough in the first place we have to slow it down more because this allows the listener to catch their breath from all the \u201cintensity\u201d from the breakdown before it.\n\nAs I have already said I do enjoy Pantera and other groove metal acts, but the same with any genre if you do not utilize your skills or the aspects of the genre nothing will be good or redeeming. I am proud of myself thus far by not mention Flynn trying to make the music \u201cepic.\u201d But I just have to mention it because I get the feeling that is what Flynn was going for in using an echo effect on his vocals when the music begins to slow down entering or ending a breakdown.\n\nThis album is not receiving such a low score because of the style of music, but because of the doors it opened for nu-metal acts like I mentioned before to feel like they are tough and can make music to appeal to people and make money at the same time. Had an album not opened the doors for such a horrible form of music to grow and formulate in front of every real metal bands eyes this album would get a higher score; even though I say this the album may only have gotten about a 23, but still. The biggest problem still seems to be though with this album, well with the band and musicians in general is that it could have a chance at being something special; but with the thoughts preying on teens who could not keep their slimy hands off of this music they stuck with a style that would get them money not praise. Basically stay away from this album; I gave in to someone to listen to it intently who said it was a classic and very good. I knew it wasn\u2019t a classic and didn\u2019t have a significant piece in the great history of metal like he told me as well; in reality it is the complete opposite.\n",
        "\nThe nineties were absolutely the period of downfall for one of the purest forms of metal that ever existed on Earth: thrash metal. The end of the 80s provided us several epic milestones in a genre that was already changing: the sheer brutality of the first wave of this genre was filtered through the acquired technique in long years of experiences and music, trying to be more mature, less obsessive and, simply, in another direction. The first years of the 90s were not bad for this genre, but the death metal was becoming more famous and well-known, while some half-thrash metal albums began to rise even among the bands you didn\u2019t expect. \n\nOn the other hand, we had completely new realities trying to jump on this train and leave a mark, a sign of their presence. One of these was Machine Head. For Rob Flynn was easy to start something new after the good job he did with Vio-lence band and find new guys to follow him on this new adventure. The genre has changed. The influences come from several sides and what Pantera already did in this genre it\u2019s impossible to delete from their minds. By the way, this new form of \u201cmetal\u201d has a completely new approach. Some riffs have survived from the breakdown of the new decade but the new influences are preponderant and they are called \u201crap\u201d and \u201chardcore\u201d.\n\nOk, already from the opener \u201cDavidian\u201d, we can listen to an unsmooth, stop-start technique on the guitars; grooving and massive-like, tired Godzilla riffs; effects on the guitars and the really bland, annoying voice of Rob. His style takes everything from the hardcore in terms of screams and rap if we are talking about the timbre and the cadence of the voice. If you expect something fast, here everything is re-written under another kind of sense and the only speed you can find is for some parts and mostly referred to the drums. The rest is like a mid-paced progression with groove parts and shitty vocals with even too clean parts like in the chorus to \u201cOld\u201d. \u201cA Thousand Lies\u201d has a dark arpeggio while the metallic, hyper high in volumes guitars and the recurring stop-and-go technique on the guitars that sounds unflowing and horrible.\n\nThe vocals are not angry at all, they are weak, derivative and naff. The songs are way too long and it is so boring that it brings me into the arms of Morpheus. There\u2019s nothing to be happy about. In \u201cNone but my Own\u201d they tried to be dark but they failed once again and the guitars are just annoying with those horrible whistles and sudden doom tempo parts. The guitars are low tuned, powerful but extremely simple on their \u201criffs\u201d and the aggression lacks completely. \u201cThe Rage to Overcome\u201d is repetitive, martial, without a soul and utterly irritating. \u201cDeath Church\u201d displays more than one eye to Korn, like in the rest of the album too. Wow, this is the crap in form of music. \n\nOnce again \u201cA Nation on Fire\u201d shows dark, long and boring arpeggios and bass parts by the beginning with soft, mallcore vocals to restart like the other song. The structure is always the same and it\u2019s not good, absolutely: the groove by the guitars, the profound, rap style voice of Rob and the same pile of shit. It\u2019s all there and all smells like a dead rat. Even in a \u201cmore violent\u201d and direct song like \u201cBlood for Blood\u201d the effects are overused and too heavy. \u201cOne, two, three, four, go!!\u201d vocal part is simply stupid while even the up tempo parts are full of groove. We scratch the bottom with \u201cReal Eyes, Realize, Real Lies\u201d and its burden of filtrated, artificial vocals and the innocent dark atmospheres. \n\nAll the songs on this album are identical and someone is still able to criticise the death metal or the violent thrash for this fault. Just listen to this and make your mind once for all, this album is going to help you. There\u2019s no violence, no aggression, the old style has gone forever and now is stone cold in the modern, crappy riffs by this basically useless and even damaging band. This is one of the milestones to understand why and how the genre changed so heavily and drastically in those years.\n",
        "\nSomewhere along the way it became elitist to simply refer to a lousy album by its proper name instead of masking righteous indignation with dishonest euphemisms and careful word choice. Whether it be nothing more than a weak defense of otherwise indefensible music or a statement in favor of taking an egalitarian approach to treating all music with the same respect when conversing on the topic, it\u2019s a common comeback amongst Machine Head fans when they see fans of pre-1992 metal not dancing to the beat of the almighty groove. But when it comes to said band and particularly their alleged return to form \u201cThrough The Ashes Of Empires\u201d, if calling this collection of mostly sonic flatulence bad makes me an elitist, then may my unapologetic arrogance be a guide for those wishing to avoid wasting money on something that is subpar even by early Machine Head album standards.\n\nThere are some traces of \u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d to be found on here, although very little of it resembles the positive aspects of that album. Mostly this reaches back to the band\u2019s second album \u201cThe More Things Change\u201d, although with a little bit more speed at times and an even poorer vocal job out of Flynn. There is plenty of really annoying high end riff fragments that are either repeated far too much or overloaded with effects, uneven lower end groove riffs that often clash with the boring straight rock drum beats, and a huge glaring spotlight right on the vocal tracks that flood the arrangement like a monsoon of nu-metal gayness. The vocals are largely what kill this thing, as even on otherwise decent half-speed metal songs like \u201cLeft Unfinished\u201d Flynn basically kisses the microphone when he inhales.\n\nEvery now and then the band will get a relatively decent idea and carry it for about maybe half of the song\u2019s duration at best, but usually scattered throughout the listen. The widely hailed opening track \u201cImperium\u201d has a couple of fairly decent riffs that filter in and out, particularly that all out thrash riff that jumps in at around the 4:40 mark. It\u2019s a little more power/thrash and melodic than what you got with Vio-Lence\u2019s first two albums, but it definitely leaves the groove field completely for greener pastures. If they had streamlined the overlong intro a little and cut out some of those unnecessary, flanger saturated, redundant lead drones this would be an all out solid track. The same story basically applies to \u201cLeft Unfinished\u201d, which has a pretty solid start up riff that falls into this stupid verse breakdown with too much vocal presence and a bunch of overdone guitar effects in the background. I guess there\u2019s just some unwritten law in the book of Machine Head that prevents these guys from just rocking out all the time and resorting to these stupid half-ballad sections and half-time breakdowns.\n\nAlthough this is Phil Demmel\u2019s first studio appearance with the band, not counting their 2003 live album \u201cHellalive\u201d, you wouldn\u2019t know it by how little lead activity is going on here and how utterly half assed most of the riffs and songwriting is. There is one worthwhile guitar solo on here stuck in the midst of a really redundant quiet interlude on \u201cIn The Presence Of My Enemies\u201d, which is otherwise just an overlong Pantera homage with about twice as many feedback passages. Other than that and a fairly decent lead interchange on \u201cVim\u201d, which is another half-decent speed metal song with just a few too many groove breakdowns interrupting the flow, there\u2019s hardly anything on here that Flynn wasn\u2019t already doing on his own since 1997 in the riff and lead department. \n\nThe rest of this album just reeks of blandness and meandering, not to mention a few occasional reversions back to the mallcore nonsense heard on \u201cSupercharger\u201d and its even gayer predecessor. \u201cBite The Bullet\u201d is loaded with terrible excuses for shouts that are dangerously close to Fred Durst territory; while these really annoying quiet sections just halt whatever flow the song has at random intervals. \u201cElegy\u201d is definitely stuck in Slipknot land, spending most of its time sitting on an extremely redundant 2 chord groove that occasionally gives way to a nearly as dull sounding Pantera riff or a boring quiet section with Flynn just softly singing nonsense that somehow manages to rhyme, actual lyrical content be damned. If there is one thing that these guys really do well, it\u2019s jamming a lot of different ways to sound non-metal into a 4 to 5 minute time span, while throwing a lot of their good ideas into longer songs that still have plenty of lazy ideas mixed in.\n\nThe only respects in which this album really differs from the last 3 before is that there is a little more speed and half-thrash elements at work and Robb Flynn has given up on his career as a rapper rolling with the pale skinned, middle class homies. If you look at the good elements of this by themselves, there is a little bit of a move towards the half-hearted groove/thrash \u201cThe Blackening\u201d, which saw some isolated aspects of Flynn and Demmel\u2019s thrash roots return. But the vast majority of this is either stuck in grunge or nu-metal territory. It\u2019s not worth spending money on unless you worship this band and already have their first and their latest album. It might make me a bullshitting elitist, but I expect more in a metal album than this, regardless of it being better than their mallcore albums. \n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on October 14, 2008.\n",
        "\nThere are a few places out there where musicality and metal come to die, and unfortunately for Robb Flynn a lot of them reside in Machine Head\u2019s back catalog. Would be innovative riff ideas are chopped apart and presented as fragmented grooves or effects drenched drones, drum beats stagnate and induce a trance state rather than command the act of head banging, and shouted vocals give way to whining like a castrated Kurt Cobain or kicking it with Fred Durst and the homeboys nu-metal style. Naturally remnants of Flynn\u2019s past filter in and out at times on some albums, but these are the exception rather than the rule, and basically disappear completely in the later 1990s.\n\nThe nature of the band has always been to take a salutatory stance on mainstream rock/metal, although if an analogy were made to a situation such as a celebration or commencement of sorts, the salutation would come late in the event rather than towards the beginning, given Machine Head\u2019s lateness in following trends. So when approaching their most mallcore/nu-metal oriented offering \u201cThe Burning Red\u201d, one has to ask the question of which is actually at the bottom of the barrel, the true pioneers of an inferior style of music or the followers who pop up soon after? If one goes by the music alone, the terribleness of this album is only slightly less than that of the valedictorian (Sepultura\u2019s \u201cRoots) in that the experiments are more localized to the groove/grunge sector of nu-metal, resulting in something that isn\u2019t quite as grotesque as the latter, but regardless this album is completely unlistenable if you are hungry for good metal.\n\nA good label for this brand of septic steeped human fecal debris is vocally oriented mallcore, in the respect that Robb Flynn\u2019s vocals basically hog all of the prominence in the mix and often completely drown out the half assed background noise guising as guitars. Now if Flynn could actually sing or write lyrics to any degree, the testicle shrinkage that accompanies hearing things like his horrid rendition of \u201cMessage In A Bottle\u201d or the quiet sections of the half-ballad crapper \u201cSilver\u201d wouldn\u2019t occur, but alas they do. Likewise, when the guy screams it just sounds like a wimpy version of Phil Anselmo meets a slightly tougher version of Jonathan Daivs, which will often lead into some really horrid Layne Staley imitations during sung sections that make Anthrax\u2019s material with John Bush sound good by comparison. I have to admit though, when Flynn starts rapping on a couple of these songs, it gets pretty damn funny unless you\u2019ve made the mistake in paying money to hear this album. To sum it all up, with this outfit you get 3 poor versions of 3 styles of vocalizing that had already been done to death for 3 years prior.\n\nIf you attempt to tune out the vocals to focus on the music, which is virtually impossible given how loud and terrible the vocals are, there isn\u2019t really much to speak of on here that hasn\u2019t really been heard on earlier albums in this style by Anthrax, Sepultura, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against The Machine, or this band\u2019s first two albums. It\u2019s basically like they took ideas from all of these, lined the walls of a room with white canvass, and threw them into a blender with no lid and wrote songs based on what parts of the walls the pieces flew onto. \u201cDesire To Fire\u201d basically kicks off with a series of redundant 2 and 3 chord grooves that don\u2019t really fit together, resulting in something that stagnates and meanders, if you can image those two things happening in the same song. Flynn screams, then he raps, then he sings grunge style, then he screams, then raps some more, before leading into some gimpy, quiet spoken breakdown section. Hey Robb, are you trying to sing or are you making a romantic book on tape geared towards the illiterate and effeminate?\n\nOnce you get past the first full length song, the extremely formulaic nature of this album unveils and you begin to feel latent homicidal tendencies towards your stereo speakers. There may be a little bit of variation when it comes to how each song begins, such as a repetitive rock beat with a bunch of guitar noise on \u201cThe Blood, The Sweat, The Tears\u201d, a boring tribal sounding beat fading in over the course of over a minute with guitar noise coming in halfway through it in \u201cExhale The Vile\u201d, or in most other cases simply throwing out a groove riff accompanied by some guitar noise within the riff itself. But regardless, you can count on the music to find its way into a stagnated groove, you can count on that annoying as hell tremolo effect that signifies a forbidden fantasy shared between Flynn and The Edge to worm it\u2019s way into just about every song on here, and you can expect Flynn\u2019s voice to either whine, choke, rap, whisper, or ad lib some the occasional yeah, come on, or 1-2-3-4.\n\nWhile there isn\u2019t any one song on here that qualifies as good to any extent, there is a level of differentiation on here. There are some bad songs on here that seem to be trying to sound metal, albeit in a lame nu-metal sort of fashion. \u201cDevil With The King\u2019s Card\u201d seems to be attempting to establish something akin to a \u201cVulgar Display Of Power\u201d atmosphere during the first two minutes, although the riffs are so flat and uninteresting that it\u2019s for naught and Flynn\u2019s vocals are whiny and weak. \u201cExhale The Vile\u201d also attempts Pantera worship with basically no real success, mostly due to their addiction to throwing in those lame high end effects driven guitar parts and Flynn\u2019s emasculated yells, drama queen whispered narrations, and sleep inducing clean passages. But most everything else is unapologetically mallcore, especially the \u201cMessage In A Bottle\u201d cover, which sucks as much decrepit, V.D. ridden cock as Limp Bizkit\u2019s remake of \u201cFaith\u201d, which I sincerely apologize for bringing up as I\u2019m sure many of you are still in shock at Durst actually making a George Michaels song sound even lamer than it originally was.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard this album or any of its contents on the radio and you have fond memories of Vio-Lence, Forbidden, or even Machine Head\u2019s first 2 albums; consider it a blessing and don\u2019t subject yourself to this. This is a musical denial of everything that is metal, albeit one that lacks the avant-garde quirks of its Brazilian cousin \u201cRoots\u201d, but otherwise pays faithful homage to it like a lackey does its master. A very small minority has argued that this is Machine Head\u2019s greatest work, and I partially agree in the respect that this album best represents the nature of this band and is a crowning achievement in Flynn\u2019s quest to get as much distance between himself and his former thrash metal roots as possible in the name of getting with the \u201cin crowd\u201d. In all its learned terribleness, it has earned the right to be branded with The Royal Seal of Gayness and is second only to Sepultura\u2019s 1996 musical abortion in its role at the salutatorian of the 90s commencement of all things mallcore.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on October 14, 2008.\n",
        "\nMy god I hate this album. I truly hate it. And yes, I\u2019ve heard it hundreds of times. Some friends of mine really got into this stuff and of course they gave me a tape without me actually asking for it. And yes, I did try it. Several times. I was wondering what the hype was all about. For years everybody was talking about this band. \n\nThis album featured two musicians I liked until the day this atrocity came out, Rob Flynn from Vio-Lence and Chris Kontos from Verbal Abuse. Of course during the nineties I had gotten used to expecting something different from the eighties musicians who used to play thrash metal , but this was MTV proof bad boy music with some guitars thrown in which didn\u2019t do much besides being heavy for the sake of heaviness and chugging a bit here and there. Not to mention the effect this kind of music had on the metal scene and the new kind of fans it drew. It is still damaged after all these years and still I also blame this band for it, even though eventually Machine Head came to their senses and started playing something similar to metal on their 5th (!) studio album.\n\nLet me put it bluntly: this is Wiggah rock. Hearing \u2018Yo\u2019 or \u2018Muthahfuckuh\u2019, jumping to slow music... That was the whole reason I got into metal during the eighties. To be far away from that bullshit! The whole bad ass attitude borrowed from the US & German hardcore and rap scenes including tattoos made it even worse. What is this shit? It certainly isn\u2019t metal. This is fat men music. I dislike the whole \u201cstanding-in-the-back-putting-up-your-agry-face\u201d atmosphere of this music. Leave that to the rappers and overweight hardcore boys.\n\n\u201cDavidian\u201d has some nice ideas on drums from Chris Kontos but in fact \u201cBlood For Blood\u201d is the only song which sounds energetic and refreshing. For the rest of the album it\u2019s the muthahfuckah-attitude all around. Come on party people, put your hands in the air and shout \u201cI stole some kids lunch money and therefor I\u2019m a bad boy\u201d. Seriously, when I\u2019m really aggressive, I don\u2019t groove. I rage! Or I pound! Aggressiveness and groovyness simply don\u2019t match.\n\nAt least Sepultura, when they started playing mid paced downtuned music, had to guts to incorporate a style (Brazilian music) which normally isn\u2019t \u201cbad ass\u201d and make it into something characteristic. You could say Pantera started it all a few years earlier but at least they still had some \u2018riffs\u2019 and a lot more diversity in their songs on Comboys from Hell. \u2018Burn My Eyes\u2019 sounds like being heavy for the sake of heaviness and the bad boy attitude is almost comical because of the cheap hardcore and rap metal monosyllabic shouting vocal styles. And by the way, there\u2019s one word even worse than \u2018Yo\u2019 and \u2018Muthahfuckah\u2019 combined\u2026.\u2018respect\u2019. Yuck! One could even say the shouting of the word \u2018respect\u2019 was the start of emo\u2026\n\nIf this is the sound of the angy working class, I\u2019m hereby declaring war on the proletariat! Metal is a \u2018feeling\u2019 which music gives to you but this album, apart from Blood for Blood (1/11 song = 09 points), never gives me that \u2018metal-feeling\u2019. Go back to \u2018tha hood\u2019 and take this crap with you.\n",
        "\nThe definition of a farce, as noted in The American Heritage Dictionary, is \u201cA light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect.\u201d Although the other definitions accompanying this one also bear some similarity to the musical situation that this term applies to here, this particular one is the most applicable as it explains not only the musical end result of \u201cThe Blackening\u201d in it\u2019s entirety, but also the manner in which most people seemed to react to it when it came out. To better understand the nature of why this album is somewhat pleasing musically, though entirely devoid of any sort of credible thrash metal merit, one has to take into account the nature of this band from its very inception. \n\nMachine Head was, first and foremost, the creation of a musician who intended to remain an item on the airwaves, as opposed to someone who creates metal out of any knowable sense of individuality. Robb Flynn is essentially the archetype for a thrash metal hipster, as ridiculous as the concept may seem. Every album put out by this outfit, which he has always had full control over, has been an exercise in 2nd rate worship of whatever seemingly aggressive type of music was edging its way into the Top 40. After seeing the success of bands like Trivium, who merged some elements of old school Metallica with their own groovy brand of metalcore, which happens to carry some similar roots with the groove and mallcore styles already emulated by this particular outfit, good ole Flynn decided yet again that one bandwagon is just as good as the last one, provided there is an established act that has already tested it and taken the risks beforehand.\n\nIn keeping with this, the musical nature of \u201cThe Blackening\u201d succeeds in being original only in the sense that the newer style being utilized is multi-faceted enough to allow the band some compositional liberties between songs. It is now okay to play fast, provided that it\u2019s not for the whole song and only for a certain amount of time between comical harmonized choruses and groovy, repetitive 2 or 3 note fits of buffoonery. Solos have actually become cool again so we have a golden opportunity for some lead guitar window dressing, so let\u2019s bring in Phil Demmel and see if we can rope in some old fans of Vio-Lence who would otherwise want nothing to do with this band. Although we now have the foundation of what would be something akin to a heavy metal meets Broadway style farcical satire, the true joke is only knowable to those third persons not watching just the show, but also the audience and seeing the punch line of the jest realized in how people foolishly laude this mediocre yet moderately enjoyable album as some sort of pinnacle of metal music.\n\nAs a member of the true audience that is viewing all of these elements, my first giggle came in right square at the beginning of the album\u2019s overlong opening track \u201cClenching The Fists Of Dissent\u201d. Although this proves to be one of the more thrashing songs and ultimately one of the better songs on here, the acoustic intro is utterly comical sounding. I take into account repetitive intros like that of Metallica\u2019s \u201cBattery\u201d, which strangely enough also appears on this album, clueing the listener in immediately of which creative well Flynn is going to, which happens to be one that\u2019s been visited repeatedly for almost 2 decades. The next 3 minutes that follow are fairly decent half-thrash, definitely not of the quality heard on \u201cEternal Nightmare\u201d, but close enough to get your head banging. Afterwards we get to a couple of groovy, Pantera-like sections which are somewhat annoying vocally, but not overtly offensive, before getting back to the fury during the guitar solos. There\u2019s a couple of goofy moments where Flynn\u2019s vocals get so wrapped up in Phil Anselmo worship that they loose any identity they\u2019ve ever had, minus one really cringe-worthy quiet section where we get a taste of the metalcore nonsense that will plague most of the rest of this album, but otherwise this song tends to stay consistently solid.\n\nFrom here on in, the album gradually deteriorates into an odd mishmash of Metallica, Pantera, Trivium, and Killswitch Engage worship. \u201cBeautiful Disaster\u201d continues the half-thrash, groovy metalcore hybrid of the opener, but with a much greater emphasis on the latter. There are a couple of repetitive, though fairly decent speed metal riffs on here, but the vocal work on here is just downright revolting. Half of the time Flynn literally sounds like either Jonathan Davis or some other hack who sings like a bad version of Eddie Vedder and screams like a bitch being anally violated with the jagged end of a broken billiard cue. \u201cAesthetics Of Hate\u201d sees the band redeeming itself a little with something resembling a thrash song, although still coated with some pseudo-melodic breakdowns with annoying clean sung vocals and sporting 1 minute of pointless guitar noise in order to drag out a 5 minute song into something that appears to be more epic in scope.\n\nBy this point, the band has basically put forth enough thrashing riffs to get away with resorting back to their groovy, radio friendly ways with \u201cNow I Lay Thee Down\u201d. There is basically no discernable distinction between this song and Machine Head\u2019s founding credo of slowed down, dumb-down riff fragments and repetitive, mid-tempo rock drumming with bad vocals. This song could have been a b-side to either of this band\u2019s first two albums, and it seems that many professed fans of Vio-Lence who otherwise don\u2019t like this band don\u2019t take notice between all the flashy metalcore surrounding it. \u201cSlanderous\u201d definitely goes a little closer to a speed metal sound, although it takes a good while to get going. In fact, during most of this album the band seems to save their best riffs for when the guitar solos come in, which tends to defeat the purpose of having them at all.\n\nThe rest of this album sees the band resorting back to what gave a somewhat better impression at the beginning; increasing the song length and trying to get at least a few good ideas out in the process. The results are two overlong groove metal songs in \u201cHalo\u201d and \u201cA Farewell To Arms\u201d, both of which could be half as long and still be boring, and the best song on here \u201cWolves\u201d. Say what you will about Flynn\u2019s semi-decent Phil Anselmo vocal worship, this song manages to stay interesting throughout most of its duration, save a few lousy breakdowns here and there. The riffs all tend to be a little less memorable than that one principle riff on the album\u2019s opener, but as a song this one is the most consistent and also the least metalcore oriented. With better vocals, this might pass for some sort of epic variant on Vio-Lence\u2019s work on \u201cOppressing The Masses\u201d. The cover of \u201cBattery\u201d basically goes through the motions, and other than a weak, flat as hell vocal job by Flynn, does not distinguish itself in any way, as if it\u2019s on here just so the band can say they covered a Metallica song. For someone who was once attached to a great Bay Area thrash band, it\u2019s embarrassing that Flynn gets his hat handed to him by Ensiferum, a band that plays epic folk metal, when it comes to covering the band credited with pioneering the thrash style.\n\nTaking all of this into account, I am tickled pink at the pretentious nature of all these various music media outlets that were proclaiming this as some sort of new classic of the thrash metal revival, because this is not a thrash album. At best, this is a half decent metalcore album with bad vocals and a few amazing guitar solos. A couple of these songs aren\u2019t bad, but as a whole, I can get more enjoyment out of hearing Trivium\u2019s \u201cThe Crusade\u201d, which is in itself a testimony to the limited faculties of the metal genre they represent. Only someone with a limited knowledge of thrash metal\u2019s origins or an all out disdain for albums that defined the genre in the mid 80s could lavish this album with so much moronic praise and call it a new thrash standard.\n\nThe final and most ironic punch line that closes this metallic farce is that despite all of the glaring flaws present here, this is Machine Head\u2019s greatest album to date. Despite the obvious mainstream pandering exhibited here, musically this is more enjoyable than \u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d or \u201cThe More Things Change\u201d, let alone the garbage that followed them. If you can stomach albums like Killswitch Engage\u2019s \u201cAlive Or Just Breathing\u201d or Trivium\u2019s \u201cThe Crusade\u201d, or maybe even Pantera\u2019s \u201cReinventing The Steel\u201d, you might like this. Just don\u2019t mistake this for being what some have claimed it to be, namely a genuine return to the thrash metal style that is being properly realized by other acts to this day.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-archives.com) on September 25, 2008.\n",
        "\nAs I am a Machine Head fanboy I will try to be as unbiased as possible. Hellalive is one of the greatest live albums, ever. It confirms that Machine Head is at their best in sold-out stadiums. Although Machine Head was going through their \"mallcore-stage\" of their career, with Ahrue Luster on guitar and the creation of nu-metal-esque CDs: The Burning Red and Supercharger, they surprisingly and effectively make a fantastic album. Also, during the early 00's Machine Head was getting a large amount of criticism because of their earlier releases. Now to the album itself.\n\nHellalive was recorded at Brixton Academy, London on December 8, 2001. The sound and production of the live release is phenomenal. What I sometimes hear is not enough of the sound/response of the crowd. Or the other way around. However, with this release Machine Head were able to come up with the perfect volume for the crowd. This creates a Flynn-Crowd yell and response thing going on. I find this to be the best part about the album. I love everything about it. Through this the listener is able to feel as if they are there at Brixton Academy. Overall, the production greats a fantastic atmosphere.\n\nThe set-list chosen for is album is great. It has a lot of tracks from their early days. This includes Old, None But My Own and I'm Your God Now. These are great additions to the set. The songs from Machine Head's \"mallcore stage\", that are on the set, are only \"the cream of the crop.\" These include The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears, American High, and Bulldozer. These are hugely improved while performed live. However, the inclusion of Supercharger, Crashing Around You and Nothing Left are incredibly dumb. Especially finishing off their live-set with Supercharger. Most Machine Head shows are finished with the incredible Davidian. Instead, on this night they finish it off with the crappy Supercharger. After Davidian the listener is left very satisfied, but with the inclusion of Supercharger the listener is left on a sour note. Then there is the song Crashing Around You. It is nor bad or good. However, on Hellalive I feel forced to say that is bad. Not because the performance is mediocre. Honestly, I think it is a vastly improved version of the song. To be able to listen to this sub-par song you have to sit through a very annoying Robb Flynn rant that is approximately 2 minutes and 20 seconds!\n\nHellalive is an aggressive, fast and intense album! It is a fantastic achievement for Machine Head, since they were \"in a rut\" at the time. They are able to persevere through the tough times and make an incredibly unique and good live album. Hellalive, also, shows Machine Head's passion towards music. For example, Flynn's very intense and loud calls to the crowd. Robb Flynn's great ability to fully interact with the crowd is shown with this CD, as well. Overall, any groove metal fan, thrash metal fan, Machine Head fan, live CD connoisseur or someone just looking for one aggressive CD should look no further then Machine Head's Hellalive. It is HELL, in a good way, at Brixton Academy when Machine Head is around!\n\nBest Tracks: Bulldozer, Ten Ton Hammer, Old, Take My Scars\n",
        "\nRight at the start I have to say that I'm a huge Machine Head fan boy. When I first heard Burn My Eyes in 1994 it had a huge impact on me. Songs like Davidian, Death Church and Old were crushing thrash anthems that alleviated many evenings of boredom. The album has also, over the years become incredibly influential. In fact, i think that debut album has been plagiarised non stop by a whole host of more recent metal-core bands. \n\nAfter the seminal debut, the band sort of lost their way. In the face of huge media hype and the overblown marketing of their label Roadrunner, Machine Head just seemed to crumple. By the time the fourth album Supercharger came round, the band was a shadow of their former selves. Pandering to the trends of the time had become the norm for Machine Head and while I still loved the debut the rest of the albums left me completely cold. \n\nThen in 2004, Machine Head rose almost phoenix like. The band released their best album since their debut with Through The Ashes Of Empires. While that album was heavy and marked a return to their thrash style it still had a few cringe worthy moments (particularly some of Robb's clean singing that sounded like Korn-lite). \n\nSo it's 2007 now and Machine Head released their sixth studio album. Named The Blackening, the pre-release buzz and hype surrounding this release made it seem like 1996 all over again when the band was on the verge of releasing their second album The More Things Change. The album leaked onto the Internet a few months before the actual release and I've been listening to this album for a few months now. \n\nThe album has a few things going for it. First, some killer riffs courtesy of Flynn and his old partner in Vio-Lence Phill Demell. The lead playing too is pretty good through out the album and I think Demell is a lot more comfortable with the band now than he was on the previous album. Dave McLane has to be one of the most underrated metal drummers around today and while his performance on The Blackening is not as flashy at it was on Through The Ashes... he pulls off a terrific performance behind the kit. Adam Duce has always held up the bottom end competently and on The Blackening you can hear him a lot more clearly than before. \n\nSo anyway, we all know that these chaps can play but what about the music ? What about the songs ? Are they any good ? Well, the answer's a bit tricky. The songs are all long. Two of the 8 songs on this album are over 10 minutes long. Now, for a thrash metal band, 10 minute songs are a tricky affair and for a Thrash metal band that has steadily flirted with trends, a ten minute song is something that could be disastrous. Machine Head for the most part, manage to pull it off. The songs are filled with some kick ass thrash riffs, some great lead playing and a rhythm section thats very very tight. At the same time, there are these parts on almost every single song that seem to be there only to please the 14 year old Trivium fan. Case in part is the intro to Now I Lay Thee Down which sounds like something the Deftones may do. Robb Flynn's clean vocals have always been a bit weak and its no different here. Especially when he tries to do the whole soaring melodic clean vocal type thing that Killswitch Engage popularised. \n\nStill this is Machine Head and when they throw commercial considerations out of the window they can write a brutal heavy as fuck thrash metal song. Aesthetics of Hate and the blistering Beautiful Mourning stand out on the album for just being completely unapologetic angry thrash metal songs. Album opener Clenching The Fists Of Dissent is over ten minutes long and is a pretty good song as well. The centre piece of the album though is the lengthy and melodic Halo. I'm sure thousands of metal core kids are going to love this song. Mixing catchy melodic parts with Machine Head's trademark riffing and some more clean singing from Flynn, the song seems written for the live audience and targeted at the trendy scene kids. I'm pretty sure the twin lead workout in the middle of the song is going to make a lot of these kids cum. Halo isn't a bad song. It just seems manufactured. \n\nAnd that really sums up the problem with The Blackening. There are some truly awesome guitar parts on this album. Some terrific songs as well but at the end of the day, it seems like these songs got so fucking long simply because the band wanted to fit in parts to please all their fans. Something for the old loyals who had stuck around faithfully and something for the new generation of fans who think Trivium is the next best thing to sliced bread. \n\nWhat I'm left with is a strange album and even after about 6 months of listening to this I can't decide how much I like/ hate the songs. For a band of this stature, it is quite disappointing that The Blackening seems a little dull and is guilty of pandering to trends. It's not a bad album by any stretch of the imagination but at the same time I was expecting a lot more this time around. \n\nhttp://www.kvltsite.com\n",
        "\nThis is my first Machine Head album so i don't have any comparison to their previous albums, though I have heard the singles off of 3 of the albums. This album was supposed to be Machine Head's return to their groove/thrash roots, however, their is quite a bit of nu-metal and rapcore elements that have been picked up along the way that can be heard in the album.\n\nThe album starts with the critically acclaimed \"Imperium.\" Though this song along with \"Bite the Bullet\" and \"Seasons Wither\" are the least mediocre on the album, it is still plagued by the same song formula as the utter shit on the album. The problem is too many fucking clean singing breakdowns. Imperium comes along nicely, sounds innovative, and even exciting then the unholy fucking Flynn begins the semi-metalcore, clean singing bullshit. It is however a listenable track, and I must admit though the chorus is a bit dumb, it is catchy. \n\nThere are many things on this album that I find annoying such as: nearly all songs having upwards of 5+ different sections, clean singing breakdowns that really kill the intensity, scattered nu-metal riffs, the monotony of the lyrics (sounds like one big crying session), vocals (Flynn's voice is tolerable for a few songs in a row, but 53 minutes of his pseudo-death metal/gargling is barely standable), and plain bad experimentation.\n\nAside from the three tracks mentioned above a few other positives of the album are a few good solos, and McClain's drumming. Whenever i zone out of the distorted nu-metal/slow groove riffs, McClain's snare slapping and bass thumping brings me right back to the fore. In my opinion he really saves the album from utter chaos.\n\nOne last complaint and then I'll quit bitching. The last song on the album \"Descend the Shades of Night\" deserves it's own little bitch section. FUCK i literally wanted to slam my forehead onto the steering wheel as i listened to this bland, droning, musical fart of a song. It was so goddamn long and boring that I could zone out of it and come back to conscienceness and it still play on and on and on.\n\nSitting in the empty black\nThe last slivers of dusk have passed\nAccept the dawn to ease the fear\nOne day I will not be here\nDeath she comes and with her thread\nUpon me ties a mask for dead\nIts tears of blood begin to seep\nAnd bleed the sky\n\n7:45 of that bullshit. And oh oh oh does ole Robby love to rhyme. \n\nAnyway I used to like this album and actually held it in decent regard. I'd be like, \"hey, I think I'll listen to Through Ashes of Empires, listen to track 1 and 2, maybe another skip to 8 then eject, without thinking. Now after listening to the whole thing through I don't even wanna make the effort anymore.\n\n55 is due solely to the drumming, few solos, and 3 songs.\n",
        "\nIs this a return to form for vocalist Robb Flynn and the rest of Machine Head? Well, if you put into consideration that three of the last five albums were radio-ready nu metal sludge, than yeah, I guess it is a return to form. But don't start believeing that all the hype and press that The Blackening has been getting is true. It's impressive, a great turn-around after the very bland and boring Through The Ashes of Empires, but it's by no means as revolutionary as these hype-makers are making you believe.\n\nLyrical-wise, Machine Head does nothing that pushes or raises the bar of what they have made before. Not that the bar was set too high anyway. \"A Farewell To Arms\" deals with the Iraq war, which is sort of different than previous subjects, but the real lyrical focus here is what all their other albums have been about: love, war, organized religion, and the same exact \"don't-fuck-with-me\" attitude that Pantera and Lamb Of God have.\n\nBut the real difference between The Blackening and previous Machine Head albums is the length of the songs. Having ten minute, epically long songs can be a double edged sword for many bands: it can make things more interesting, like on Opeth's albums, or it can make things extremely monotonous, like on Metallica's Load and St. Anger. The Blackening falls subject to both of these outcomes here. The tempo changes and the crazy-fast and surprisingly technical solos make a simple, four-minute groove thrash song into a ten-minute monster that never gets old. But songs such as \"Halo\" and \"Wolves\" have nearly the exact same riffs, so it's hard to even distinguish between the two.\n\nIf I had to name an ironclad reason on why The Blackening doesn't totally kick ass, I would have to say that Robb Flynn's vocals are the culprit. When he screams, he sounds like a disconcerting mix of Corey Taylor and Howard Jones, which is really not as bad as it might sound on paper. But when he sings, it's a completely different story. It seems as if this guy is crying as he sings, and if that's not bad enough for a fucking thrash metal album, he does it frequently. Bring on the thrash, and not the weepy moaning.\n\nSo Machine Head has discovered progressive metal, incorperated it into their bread-and-butter thrash, and everyone goes nuts about it. And let me be the first to tell you (but I'm not, look at all the other reviews here) that this is completely untrue. It's solid, and may even end up as one of the best metal albums of the year, but it's nowhere near the standard to which it is held. In fact, I listened to Burn My Eyes three times after I listened to this album. Any album that makes you want to listen to that band's past work, is not a revolutionary one.\n",
        "\nI'll admit, the very first time I listened to this, it really didn't get me. But since then, oh my how it has grown on me. Like nothing else. It's now ranking among my favourite albums of all time, and I would confidently proclaim it not only Machine Head's best effort to date, but THE album of their career, the one that will define them. I'm heaping a lot of praise on it, I know, but I think it's deserved. I just can't stop listening, it's all so good, such a beautiful piece of work. It's got it all: awesome, crunching riffs, excellent solos, forceful vocals, good, intelligent song-writing, and all of it is put together so skillfully. There's simply not a SINGLE bad moment in the album. We even have, as a nice bonus, their recent cover of Metallica's seminal thrash masterpiece \"Battery\".\n\nThe best description, other than all this shameless praise, is a blending of mid-era Pantera thrash (Cowboys From Hell, Vulgar Display of Power) with modern metalcore. That's part of it's excellence: I'm not a huge fan of metalcore, it just lacks some of the elements of melody, and moves too far away from the core song structures and techniques of heavy metal. But this is like metalcore with added heavy and added metal, and it's a gorgeous result. Slow or fast, meoldic or brutal, thoughtful or just plain violent, it succeeds every time.\n\nAesthetics of Hate is a lovely scream of hatred at William Grim, a man who wrote an article hailing the murder of Dimebag Darrell and labelling the genre of metal as worthless. This song is one big \"Fuck you\" to him. \"Clenching the Fists\" is an excellent opener, really showcasing the band's talents, and I'm betting it'll become a stable part of their live set-list. Slanderous is a perfect anthem for anyone pissed off at labels and stereotypes, and in A Farewell To Arms we have one of the most stirring and powerful closing songs of this kind of music.\n\nIt also stands out as something quite original: while influences are obvious, it's a nice interesting new flavour of metal that I haven't truly heard before. Don't try it unless you're after something aggressive. But if you do want something like that, you won't go wrong here. The guitars, drums, vocals, it all makes it a very nice album for those in an angry mood. It perfectly shows off what's good about metal: the anger, the aggression, but directed as a driving force to not accept injustice and to stand together as people who love this kind of music. Many will agree they liked the look of such long songs, and they don't disappoint at all. They never get boring, never seem to stretch themselves, it's just so well crafted. Not just done, but really crafted. The lyrics stand out as intelligent, and the vocals are just the right side of death grunts, not going so far as that, but still being very brutal indeed. I've heard a lot of comparison between Trivium's \"The Crusade\" and Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\", sometimes meant in a good way, sometimes bad, and I don't agree with either in the slightest, such a comparison is idiotic rubbish. But here, in The Blackening, I feel we have something that is much more worthy of comparison, not necessarily in general sound, but in the core structure and quality of the work.\n",
        "\nHype. Quite a double edged sword when it comes to new releases, rising bands, or upcoming tours. If done correctly, it can get those who would not normally be associated with certain acts to become fans, or at least follow the band more closely then they would otherwise. If not, well, the results could be somewhat disastrous, leading to over-expectation and disappointment. Every year certain bands jump onto the hype machine with varying results. With 2007's The Blackening, Machine Head took this gamble, and for quite awhile now, we've had to hear about how heavy, progressive, and kick *** it is. Or something to that effect. And with early reviews of The Blackening popping up across the net, it seems critics were taking a liking to the album's direction. The hype machine is still plugging away, I see. However, I am not what you would call the biggest Machine Head fan, and despite all the praise flying around, I was still feeling pretty sceptical about what they could produce. After all, this is Machine Head. Unsurprisingly, I was quite right about The Blackening. It isn't really that special\u2026at all.\n\nTwo things, bands and their albums rather, come to mind when I listen to The Blackening. The first is a more appropriate comparison when it comes to actual sound. In 1991, Dark Angel followed released the disappointing Time Does Not Heal, an album which proudly stated \"9 songs, 67 minutes, 246 riffs!\" There may have been 246 riffs, there may not have been, but what I do know for sure was that Time Does Not Heal was a colossal waste of time. For a more modern example, there's DragonForce. And who doesn't know DragonForce's musical formula, one that seems like it focuses more and being faster than the speed of sound than, well, sounding good. Their breakthrough record, Inhuman Rampage, not unlike Time Does Not Heal, was pretty bland and uninspired. Only instead of 246 riffs in 67 minutes it had a million riffs in 56 minutes. Or something. So why did I write 149 words on two mediocre albums and mention The Blackening only once? Because The Blackening feels exactly like these two albums. It has riffs galore; for the most part, these are terribly boring groove riffs, but there are some thrashy guitar lines, solos and harmonies as well. But mostly bland, soulless groove riffs which got old almost as quickly as any other metal trend.\n\nHowever, the comparison to both of those albums does not end there. In effort to create ultra heavy, br00tal, tr00 metal and incorporate what frontman and guitarist Rob Flynn claims to be 20-30 different riffs \u2013 molten riffs at that \u2013 half of The Blackening is home to songs exceeding at least six minutes in length. Four of these five tracks pass the nine minute mark. Yes that's right, 9 minutes. Some bands can and are rather good at writing superb nine minute epics. See Iron Maiden and Opeth. Machine Head is not one of these bands. I may have mentioned something similar to this in a different review about as different band (I've definitely thought about doing it in the past), but I'm not quite sure you could find a more appropriate place to apply such a description. Machine Head's two longest pieces, Clenching the Fists of Dissent and A Farewell to Arms are 10:35 and 10:12 respectively. Unsurprisingly, both are completely unlistenable. Clenching the Fists of Dissent starts out decently enough with a mix of clean guitars and light distortion for about one minute forty seconds, before reverting to mediocre thrash guitar and horrid Phil Anselmo impressions from Flynn. Chugging, shouting, chugging, shouting, and more chugging follows and you've pretty much listened to the whole album before the opening song is half over. Honestly, Clenching the Fists of Dissent was a horrible way to start the album, as it does nothing, save for maybe causing one to pull his or her hair out. And give the listener a bad (yet accurate) impression of what is too come.\n\nAdmittedly, The Blackening does improve with the three middle tracks, Beautiful, Slanderous, and Now I Lay Thee Down, but even these tracks are far from enjoyable. Slanderous and Now I Lay Thee Down are the two strongest tracks, and start out fairly decently with interesting guitar riffs. Luckily, we also get a break from Rob's ear splitting shout with some clean vocals, and while these clean vocals are not exceptionally crafted, they're far stronger than the alternative. Ultimately, the three middle tracks are just average groove tracks (meaning that they're fairly terrible), but I would definitely take nine Slanderous-es what Machine Head has offered here. They're much easier to digest and for all their shortcomings, are far more enjoyable than the likes of Wolves or Halo.\n\nAs much as I would like to say otherwise, there were a few redeemable parts of The Blackening. Not many, mind you, but on occasion they managed to put together some fairly solid passages. For the most part, this revolves around the guitar tandem, Phil Demmel and Rob Flynn. Something I will not deny the pair is their skill on the axe. No, they aren't mind blowingly great and you wouldn't mix them up with Rusty Cooley or John Petrucci, but every now and then they pull of some thrashy riff, solo, or harmony which could make one smile, I suppose. The solos fit the music fairly well, and are almost always blazing fast or as Flynn would probably put it \"metallic and molten.\" Unfortunately, Machine Head does not make use of these techniques enough for them to make a difference, and they are really overshadowed by the listless riffing.\n\nOverall, Machine Head's 2007 offering and sixth album, The Blackening, is probably one of the weakest, most overrated albums of the year. While I can se many enjoying it, due to its horrid song writing, equally unpleasant vocals, and aside from a few moments in every song, mediocre instrumental performances, I will not be one of these people. I'm not sure if Machine Head can do better than this, as I have not really listened to any Machine Head in the past, but one would assume they can as The Blackening never really does anything to warrant more than two listens. It gets progressively worse with each listen, and unless you're into wasting 61 minutes of your life I do not recommend checking this out. If The Blackening did not include any of the 9-10 minute jam sessions, it would probably be a more interesting listen, though only a 40, maybe 50 at most. Just as with Dark Angel's Time Does Not Heal or DragonForce's Inhuman Rampage, I don't bother checking this out. Seriously. \n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nMachine Head are a band often slandered \u2013 and for a good reason. The band has a grand total of six decent tracks over a career spanning fifteen years. Now that\u2019s a roughly one listenable track every 3 years. Considering that five of these decent tracks appeared on their debut, Machine Head have slid pretty fast from their peak (which wasn\u2019t high at all) on Burn My Eyes and they finally hit rock bottom with Supercharger which left them with an all but empty fan base. Their change of style resulted in their entire metal fan base\u2019s evapouration (these \u2018fans\u2019 themselves being blind sheep who couldn\u2019t see discern the conspicuous signs of Machine Head\u2019s devolution or tell the difference between true thrash and false thrash) and with Supercharger even their newly acquired mallcore fans and the trend-hopper crowd turned away leaving the band in shambles. Normally, you\u2019d expect Robb to just wrap up, pick up the pieces, apologize for unleashing abomination upon abomination to the metal crowd and leave the scene once and for all. Unfortunately, Robb was far from normal. So what did he do? Take a well-timed break and then resurrect Machine Head claiming they had \u2018returned to their thrash roots\u2019. Of course, the blind sheep once again flocked to Robb and the gullible newer metal fans (exposed to such rotting aberrations as Korn and Limp Bizkit) caught on as well, claiming Machine Head to be their \u2018favourite thrash band\u2019 just because they couldn\u2019t handle real thrash. Machine Head\u2019s Through the Ashes of Empires was subsequently released and was a groove-mallcore crossover album with lyrics tailored to the mallcore crowd, complete with whiny lyrics and Robb wagging a finger at his biological parents who had abandoned him. While he didn\u2019t give a damn about his biological parents earlier or didn\u2019t make such a fuss about their admittedly heinous act, here he whines and whines over it just so he can appeal to goth fags and mallcore kiddies. Anyone who criticized him was labeled unsympathetic and thus Robb succeeded, Through the Ashes was a huge success and Machine Head became the \u2018in\u2019 thing once again. Now, 3 years later and riding on Through the Ashes\u2019 success, what would Robb do?\n\nJump on the metalcore bandwagon, of course! I mean, if they changed style once what prevents them from changing again? Here we have an album filled with all the clich\u00e9s of metalcore. The riffs are either excessively melodic or blatantly mallcore in nature, even the groove riffs lack bite especially in the longer tracks. The solos are much better and longer too than usual Machine Head fare which deemphasizes soloing. Of course, this was a necessity, if MH stuck to their usual soloing antics they would be outplayed by three-fourths of the metal bands out there which would be a mighty shame. Speaking of shame, MH doesn\u2019t just rip off Killswitch Engage musically, but also vocally. Robb Flynn\u2019s clean vocals are more pronounced here and besides its miraculous ability to induce vomiting in any real metal fan, it also sounds almost exactly like Howard Jones of KsE! This too is a pre-requisite considering the genre MH just entered. The lyrics are usual MH whining, Robb Flynn has a penchant for being silly and acting like a disparaged youth. Even though he\u2019s somewhere in his higher 30\u2019s, all the guy can think of is hatred, hatred and more hatred. I can\u2019t help but pity Dave McClain\u2019s position in this stagnant band he is the band member who most often shines here \u2013 pounding the drums with fury and passion. Phil too left Vio-lence for the more lucrative (money-wise) MH and I know this decision of his will stick on his conscience for very long. \n\nOn a song level, \u2018Clenching the Fists of Dissent\u2019 is the only above average song here with that intro riff and the solo section with the pumping drumming and deadly riffing. Of course, the length mars the song once again with the last 4 minutes being complete filler. \u2018Slanderous\u2019 starts off quite well (despite being disturbingly melodeath) but falls as soon as it should actually be ready to take off. \u2018Halo\u2019, \u2018Wolves\u2019 and \u2018A Farewell To Arms\u2019 have their moments as well but sadly, these are few and far between and only serve to raise them just above the dung heap that is the rest of the album. The long songs are grossly overlong, but I don\u2019t mind the length because it is in these very songs that MH doesn\u2019t mind sneaking in the few bearable riffs the album has. Often, a good idea is picked up but readily discarded in favour of an already abused melody line or some hardcore-style mosh riffing. The rest of the songs are awful, they are a complete mockery of metal and deserve the cold shoulder or rather the cold ear. Which mortal could come up with something so offensive to the ears as this I have no clue. The worst of the lot is \u2018Now I Lay Thee Down\u2019 with Robb Flynn exercising his vocal cords, or as I prefer to call them \u2013 the ear rapists with some carefully crafted KsE style clean vocal \u2018harmonies\u2019. \n\nTo conclude, you only need to know one thing about the album \u2013 AVOID. Every time you buy this album, Robb Flynn laughs from his mallcore throne at your stupidity. The album gets 10 points for \u2018Clenching The Fists of Dissent\u2019 and 10 more for the isolated segments in the rest that manage to impress. This is definitely MH\u2019s best stuff since Burn My Eyes, but that isn\u2019t anything to be proud of.\n",
        "\nMachine Head \u2013 The Blackening (2007)\n\nMuch has been said about Machine Head\u2019s most recent work \u2013 the aptly titled \u201cThe Blackening\u201d \u2013, pretty much all the buzz being overwhelmingly positive. Some of the reviews have seemed a little bit over-the-top \u2013 Maximum Metal called this album \u201cthe greatest heavy metal of all time\u201d \u2013 and as far as I was concerned, MH were still recovering from their five-year nu-metal binge. \u201cThrough the Ashes of Empires\u201d showed great promise, and was a very good album, producing excellent songs such as \u201cImperium\u201d, \u201cSeasons Wither\u201d, and the creepy and brutal eight-minute ballad, \u201cDescend the Shades of Night.\u201d When I heard that they were working on a new album that would contain only eight tracks \u2013 most of them well over five minutes and two of them exceeding ten minutes \u2013 I must admit I had my hopes set fairly high. Could they possibly pull it off again, using the same reliable formula as TTAOE? Could they finally break free of the despicable world of nu-metal and finally gain they respect they once had circa \u201cBurn My Eyes?\u201d Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to say that they not only could; they did. \n\n\n\u201cThe Blackening\u201d is a staggering behemoth of an album. It is one of the greatest progressions I have ever seen by any musical group, and with it MH have finally regained their heavy metal crown. Old MH fans must be forewarned, however: \u201cThe Blackening\u201d sounds nothing like \u201cBurn My Eyes,\u201d nor does it sound like anything else they have ever done before. TTAOE was merely a stepping stone towards this masterpiece. There is not a single song that is out of place, not a single riff or drum roll that isn\u2019t absolutely perfect. Rob Flynn and company took the time to sit down, play their fucking asses off, and produce an album of the highest quality. It is one hour and one minute of ingenious songwriting, and you will never be bored for a second. It takes a lot for a band to write a song over nine minutes, and still keep me interested. Few bands \u2013 among them are Nile and Neurosis \u2013 have achieved this feat without being overly repetitious, and it is a journey only made more perilous by complex and lightening-fast songwriting. MH prove themselves worthy of that list not once, but four times on \u201cThe Blackening.\u201d \u201cClenching the Fists of Dissent,\u201d \u201cHalo,\u201d \u201cWolves,\u201d and \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d all pass the test with flying the colors; the last track is not only the best closing track I have ever heard \u2013 it outdoes \u201cDescend the Shades of Night\u201d by a mile \u2013 but also one of the best metal songs of the past ten years. \n\n\n\u201cBeautiful Morning,\u201d \u201cAesthetics of Hate\u201d and \u201cSlanderous\u201d are brutal, venomous thrashers which juxtapose some melodic singing with sickeningly fast riffage. \u201cNow I Lay Thee Down\u201d is the only song on the album that could be described as a ballad. Being one of the shorter tracks on the album, it\u2019s also one of the best. Flynn reaches emotional heights here rarely seen in metal. I cannot possibly describe in words how awesome these eight tracks are. They have been described as groove and thrash, and honestly I\u2019d add prog to that list without a moment\u2019s hesitation. But in reality, you cannot pigeonhole music like this; it is like nothing you will have ever heard before. As for the musicianship, MH have again exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s as if they took all the great hooks, leads, blasts, and rolls from TTAOE, multiplied them by ten, and then improved on all of them. Bravo to all of the musicians here, most especially Robb Flynn. Not only is his guitar work awesome as always, but his vocal abilities have improved greatly, as well. He tends to veer away from the \u201cwhinier\u201d singing seen on TTAOE and really showcases his singing here. Also enhanced are his growls and screams here; they are harder-hitting, more guttural, and far more menacing. \n\n\nI could go on and on about how incredible this album is. It is a landmark not only for thrash, groove and progressive metal, but for heavy metal as a whole. No one saw this coming, not even myself. I thought \u2013 reasonably \u2013 that TTAOE was going to be the best thing MH ever put out; boy was I wrong. MH have crafted a unique and skull-crushing sound and have not only made an album better than BME or TTAOE, but also better than most metal releases today. It is going to be difficult to find a candidate worthy enough to take \u201cThe Blackening\u2019s\u201d place as the best album of 2007.\n",
        "\nAfter Machine Head's classic Burn My Eyes, things only seemed to go downhill for the band. They became more commercial and churned out a few inexcusably lame nu-metal albums (a la Fear Factory) before returning somewhat to their roots on the more recent Through The Ashes of Empires. WIth 2007's The Blackening, Machine Head have found themselves at a crossroads somewhere between the revived Exodus and Killswitch Engage. Some may like this new incarnation; others, notsomuch. But you can't deny its sheer fist-pumping, headbanging power. \n\nThe album starts off slowly with Clenching The Fists of Dissent, a 10-minute opener. Wait, what the hell? Ten minutes? I thought it was tacitly understood that thrash bands reach their maximum at Metallica's eight and a half. Well, in any event, we're given a soft, classical guitar bit that explodes into a groovy thrash riff. Sound like Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning? Well, yeah, it's pretty much a direct ripoff and a tad cliched at this point. But that doesn't mean it's bad. Personally, I dislike Rob Flynn's riffing style- groovy, Pantera-esque bits mixed with natural harmonics and effects here and there. It sounds too overproduced to my ears, but that's just me. The acoustic bits on The Blackening are horribly recorded, sounding hollow and boring. The band's been around for more than a decade; haven't they figured out yet that it is possible to use acoustic guitars for clean portions of metal albums? Instead, they opt for having a dreadfully bad clean tone that just makes it sound hokey. But I digress.\n\nNext we have Beautiful Mourning and Aesthetics of Hate. When Flynn bellows \"FUCK YOU ALLLLLL!\" at the beginning of the former, you will feel it like a blow to the jugular. The badass meter on this one is filled to the top for this record, believe me. Unfortunately, it often descends into nu-metal-fueled stupidity, such as on Aesthetics of Hate. Sure, it's fast, thrashy, and angry, but the lyrics are just a poor excuse to curse a bunch. Ironically, the song is best when Flynn whispers eerily \"May the hand of God strike you down...\" Unfortunately, Beautiful Mourning shows us the first evidence of Machine Head's metalcore tendencies, with a boring and whiny clean chorus. \n\nNow I Lay Thee Down is a great number, slower and more moody. A bit nu-metal but the crushing riffs save it from being lame. Some great vocal work on this song as well. Slanderous is nice and fast, but the riffs often get annoying and repetitive. Halo is alright but has another Killswitch Engage-esque chorus. Wolves is just a great song. I can't believe no other band has started a song with the lyrics \"UNLEASH THE WOLVES!\" yet, as it seems to lend itself very well-suited to the music. Wolves has a number of great solos, which are almost too prevalent on this album, but they're so good it's hard to complain.\n\nLastly, we have A Farewell To Arms. If you thought Metallica's One was the be-all and end-all of war ballads in metal, well, this will prove you wrong. It begins with a truly haunting vocal melody and turns into an operatic, catchy chorus that manages to refrain from being whiny. After a few minutes of this, Flynn simply decides to break you in half over his knee with crushing riff after crushing riff. These first few minutes may be slow, but it's arranged so well and the music is so creepy that you won't notice. About halfway through, everything stops and Flynn demands: \"So is this how we live? Or is this how we DIE?\" and a completely asskicking barrage of metal storms through your wall like the Kool-Aid guy and gives your unborn child an abortion. Yeah, it's just that badass. An epic solo (lots of tapping- to think they're not trying to one-up Metallica with this one would be foolish) and some more purely awesome riffs close one of the best metal songs in years. \n\nA few of the tracks are polished turds (Beautiful Mourning and Halo in particular), but even those have some great and semi-redeeming moments. With this much material (toppping the one hour mark by 58 seconds), almost any thrash fan can find something here to love. It comes off as a bit bloated/pretentious/nu-metally at times, but the good material is so good you really won't care. If you like Pantera, Metallica, Megadeth, Exodus, Anthrax, and the like, you must pick this record up.\n",
        "\nIn the end, the MH baiting just gets fucking boring. Since 1995, a ridiculous amount of metalheads have hounded and heckled this band unceasingly, as though endless whiny bitching is the way to ensure that another album like \u2018Burn My Eyes\u2019 comes out. What can really get on the nerves is the fact that if they did release something in that vein, people would moan about the repetition of the formula Well, stick this in your fucking pipes and suck on it \u2013 \u2018Burn My Eyes\u2019 has gone. Cherish at as the classic it is and leave it at that. \n\nNow, not for a second am I suggesting that the sun shines out the arse of much of Machine Head\u2019s post \u2018Burn\u2026\u2019 material, but then to disregard it all simply because it does not reach those lofty standards is a bit of a daft attitude to take. And nowhere can this point be more solidly proven than on the \u2018Head\u2019s first live recording, \u2018Hellalive.\u2019 \n\nOpening to the roars of the crowd and the strains of the infamous Omen film soundtrack, the band waste absolutely no fucking time. Crashing into \u2018Bulldozer\u2019 with a thunderous, pile driving drum fill and squealing, shrieking guitar, the \u2018Head spend the next 7 songs tearing the Brixton Academy a new arsehole. While the likes of \u2018Old\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m Your God Now\u2019 are as viciously anthemic as many have come to expect from them, it\u2019s the material of latter albums that offers a kick ass surprise \u2013 tracks such as \u2018Crashing Around You\u2019 and \u2018The Blood, The Sweat, The Tears\u2019 are granted a lease of new, bastardised life and sound 10 times more heavy than they ever could on record. The former, especially, sounds just like its fucking title is coming true, the meandering half-ballad becoming an epic monster of a song in the live arena. \n\nAnd therein lies the album\u2019s greatest strength; it\u2019s ability to soundly assure the listening metalhead that a live arena is truly the place Machine Head belong. While Rob Flynn\u2019s (heavy, heavy) guitar does occasionally drop out, he more than makes up for it in his competent attempts to whip the crowd into a frenzy. Dave McClain and Adam Duce prove themselves to be one of the tightest, most pounding rhythm sections of modern times, and even the archetypal mallcore guitarist Ahrue Luster manages to make it through the set without spoiling proceedings. \n\nOf course, the album is far from perfect \u2013 much of the set after \u2018I\u2019m Your God Now\u2019 sees a considerable drop in quality, and simply plods along with nothing worth mentioning. Except for \u2018American High\u2019 of course, which frankly sounds fucking abysmal, and interests tapers off as fast as expectations of a kick-ass ending. \n\nBut, astoundingly, Machine Head pull through with fists raised high in the final round. \u2018The Burning Red\u2019 is a power ballad like no other \u2013 immense in its beauty, pensive and raw rather than soppy and teary, it\u2019s a perfectly prelude to the crashing finale of THAT track, the absolutely mammoth \u2018Davidian\u2019. Heavy as all fuck and akin to a sucker punch to the throat, this bastard track should by rights have finished off the crowd rather than \u2018Supercharger\u2019, which, while acceptable, simply doesn\u2019t make your brain feel like it\u2019s been crushed into dust like \u2018Davidian\u2019 does. \n\nSo that\u2019s that: \u2018Hellalive.\u2019 Besides some stinking piles of shit here and there, the glowing gems make this an album any \u2018Head fanatic can be proud to have amidst there metal collection. \n\nSuck on that, indeed.\n",
        "\nMachine Head have been resurrected, despite some of the \u201cmallcore\u201d claims of this album. After the massively disappointing and rather unforgivable mistake that was Supercharger I had more than given up hope for the band. Machine Head was dead to me. The band that I so loved had quietly curled up and died along with nu metal. I will not deny this. Machine Head had died in the time following Supercharger \u2013 only to be reborn in a new form. Through the Ashes of Empires (which I believe to be a clever title referencing their nu metal stint) is a new form of Machine Head.\n\nThrough the Ashes of Empires has Machine Head returning to their hearts. The labels had given up on them, the fans had given up on them, and so the only people that Machine Head had to write this album for, were them. This has given the band and the music a new found ferocity that listeners haven\u2019t heard in years.\n\nMost of the album was written as a three piece with Rob, Adam, and Dave. These songs still have some of the groove oriented sound that Machine Head have come to embrace but now it has been surrounded by fast paced music. The inclusion of Phil Demmel (playing with Rob Flynn previously in Vio-Lence) not only added another layer to the music but brought about somewhat of a thrash tendency in the band \u2013 this will be approached later.\n\nThe guitar work is still very heavy on the rhythm parts but with more complex riffing and a focus on musicianship that that band had lost. The leads (oh yeah \u2013 these are back) are tight and the semi-solo sections (most of the solos aren\u2019t a \u201ctrue\u201d solo but more likened to bridge territory) are well placed and well performed. The most shocking aspect of the guitar work is the new found emotion in a lot of the work. \u201cImperium,\u201d one of the most impressive songs the band as EVER written, and the guitar work on that song is unmatched.\n\nThe bass and drum work have both taken a back seat to the guitar work (being as their nu metal sound earlier required both of them to come forward quite a bit) but both have become more intense and complex. They pick up the slack of the rhythm while the guitars do their melodic thing. \n\nRob Flynn is back with a vengeance. The half-assed rapping is gone (although the song \u201cWipe the Tears\u201d has some spoken work that some people might consider rap-ish) and replacing it is his post thrash back and even some of the singing that he has picked up along the way. \u201cDescend the Shades of Night\u201d has some of his best vocal work as a singer and really shows the melody that the band has put together. \n\nThe addition of Phil Demmel is amazing new layer to Machine Head. His style of thrash til death can be felt in the few songs he helped write. \u201cSeasons Wither\u201d in particular is pretty thrash injected and Phil\u2019s presence is a catalyst to the rest of the band to really kick the music in the ass.\n\nRob\u2019s lyrics are as personal as every with songs about being strong in one\u2019s convictions and even a seething song about his real parents (\u201cFuck you, you cocksucker \u2013 fuck you, you whore\u201d is particularly an angry phrase \u201cLeft Unfinished\u201d). The album is full of empowerment anthems and emotional confessions that makes you headbang and think about societal issues.\n\nThe emotion is pure and raw on Through the Ashes of Empires \u2013 the band has finally come home. The intensity is back along with heartfelt music that had been sacrificed to the almighty dollar. Machine Head are trying to regain their integrity and just by hearing the song \u201cImperium\u201d my loyalty to the band has returned and even become greater because of this album. Machine Head are back \u2013 and they have a bone to pick with the world.\n\nSongs to check out: Imperium, Seasons Wither, Descend the Shades of Night.\n",
        "\nSupercharger is evidence to the stubbornness that is Machine Head. Despite poor initial reactions to the nu metal style Machine Head converted to on their previous album, The Burning Red, Machine Head even head further into the nu metal genre on this release. So the people that have \u201cnumetalphobia\u201d need not even try to listen to Supercharger but simply skip the album and move on.\n\nThe album itself feels as though the band is drowning too. The writing isn\u2019t very cohesive and despite a few songs that try to redeem the album as a whole \u2013 it just isn\u2019t enough to right this sinking ship. The performances of each member are watered down and even though the album doesn\u2019t necessarily have \u201cbad\u201d performances, they do feel as though they aren\u2019t heartfelt and the band wasn\u2019t playing for themselves anymore.\n\nThe guitar work is what really throws me for a loop. The guitars are down-tuned to the point that any technicality is lost in the distortion of the sound. Most of the guitars are also pretty simplistic material. There is nothing more relevant than some simple riffing and then some slower melodic lines. Solos are almost completely extinct on Supercharger (even though Rob Flynn is quite a guitar player). The guitars have some emotion in the melodic parts but overall it\u2019s a pretty dull, stop-and-go, nu metal kind of riffing. Not all that special.\n\nThe drum and bass work is what really holds this album together. The bass is heavily prominent on the album as is the drum work. Both have also taken an intelligence drop and been simplified to the point that it\u2019s really not even funny. The bass is catchy and that helps in the overall structure of the music so that it doesn\u2019t get too boring as the album continues on. The drums are decent but again \u2013 pretty simple stuff here.\n\nRob Flynn was one of the best post-thrash vocalists (and now after Supercharger is once again) that I have heard. He was harsh without being death metal but he wasn\u2019t as high in sound to be a great thrash vocalist. All of that is gone. No post-thrash vocals here. He does a more understandable vocal style that is very much in the vein of nu metal. He does some of his really bad rapping on this album once again (I was hoping that would die \u2013 but evil never stops). \n\nLyrically, the album isn\u2019t as tight as previous efforts but it is decent. Some of the lyrics are clever and Rob Flynn has always been a superior lyric writer. Although some of the songs themselves have strange lyrics (American High) other songs are saved from being nu metal fodder by their lyrics (Crashing Around You). So there is a huge variation in the quality of lyrics but overall it\u2019s probably the best part of the album.\n\nSupercharger is full of nu metal clich\u00e9s. I feel bad for Machine Head for heading down this road and eventually having to reclaim their legitimacy after the release of this album. There are some tracks that are worth at least one listen but overall I wouldn\u2019t say this album is a \u201cmust listen\u201d even to die hard fans.\n\nSongs to check out: Crashing Around You, Trephination, Supercharger.\n",
        "\nDuring the mid 90s there was an abundance of groove metal, with new bands popping up everywhere coupled with some old thrash heroes changing their sound to appeal to fans of this new movement. This music sucked. While Pantera did a reasonably good job of it, the other bands were just plain bad. Machine Head's debut did a lot to help solidify this movement, and unsurprisingly it, like nearly all of the stuff that came out of the genre, isn't very good. Machine Head's sound is similar to that of other groove bands, consisting of downtuned, simplistic grooves that don't really go anywhere or change at all. \n\nThere are some good songs on here however. Opener 'Davidian' is the best song they ever did. Although it starts off with a slow paced intro it speeds up into a more moderate pace with a pretty good riff coming in and taking over. Add in an above average solo and this song turns out quite well. 'Blood for Blood' has another boring intro full of random guitar squeals and noises before it speeds up into a good, heavy riff. Although sounding a bit rushed at time, the song is pretty catchy and Flynn's vocals don't sound nearly as pathetic as they normally would. Finally, 'A Thousand Lies' is boring in the verses but it really picks up in the chorus with a nice galloping riff, which saves it from the mediocrity of the rest of the album.\n\nThe other songs on here are simply not worth hearing. The riffs are unoriginal and sleep inducing and a lot of the songs seem to drag on and on and on. Not really a good thing considering the songs average out at around five minutes. From the pointless interlude 'Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies ' which consists of a stupid riff with random noises over the top to the grunge inspired 'I'm Your God Now' which has soft singing in the verses and some predictable groove riffing in the choruses, a lot of this stuff is just pointless and boring. And then there are Flynn's vocals. While I can usually tolerate sub standard vocals the ones on here just piss me off. For example, the song 'Davidian' is almost ruined by the overly loud vocals which are supposed to sound pissed off but are laughable. The previously mentioned 'I'm Your God Now' has him trying to imitate Kurt Cobain in parts, while 'Old' has some cringe worthy moments in the chorus. The album is over produced and polished to the point of absurdity, and the vocals and drums are pulled forward in the mix for some reason.\n\nWhat really pisses me off though is that despite the blatantly groove riffing, the slowed down pace and the over polished production some people still believe that this shit is thrash. I wasn't expecting a thrash album when I got it, just a solid groove one which didn't overuse it to the point of stupidity. If they put the three good songs on an EP it would be quite good, but alas this is not the case. If you really like groove metal or are one of the aforementioned idiots who don't know what thrash is then you'll probably enjoy this, otherwise just stay away from this and listen to some Vio-lence or something (bet you didn't see that coming).\n",
        "\nWhen Machine Head recorded their last album 'Through The Ashes Of Empires', they had just recruited old Robb Flynn friend and former Vio-Lence guitarist Phil Demmel to fil in the second guitar duties. Now, I'm certain that Demmel is half the reason that that album is the big fucking deal it is. Sure, he came in after the writing process, but I'm certain that if it weren't for him those little bonuses such as guitar harmonies and thrash based solos wouldn't be there. Though Machine Head have had the element of thrash, they've never really dealt with guitar harmonies nor solo trade off's or anything of the kind. Though Demmel didn't write any of those songs, I'm certain he fixed them up. Hear the demo to 'Descend The Shades Of Night', it's terrible. I wreckon he'd be the reason it turned out to be the epic it is.\n\nThen of course, Machine Head re-released the album with a new song. 'Seasons Wither', a track that Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel wrote together. Though the song was very suitable for the album and flowed well within it, there was a noticeable difference between that song and the others. For instance, it sure as fuck was faster. It wasn't 'Blood For Blood' fast, but it was faster. The other thing was that it had this clean vocal harmony mid-way, that always reminded me of Killswitch Engage. This wasn't a bad thing though, the song worked well and turned out to pretty much be a highlight on the album. Being that this song was the first proper collaberation of Demmel and Flynn, you could tell that this was a preview of things to come.\n\nSo in saying that, this album is the extended 'Seasons Wither'. Even though they've reached faster tempo's, it's faster in total compared to any previous releases. It's jam packed with guitar solos, guitar harmonies, fast paced riffs, intense drumming, occasionally quite interesting bass work and some strong vocals. I think I'm probably most surprised (in a good way) by Robb Flynn's ability to write some solid leads. I never thought he was a bad guitarist, and he has had his fair share of good solo's before (ala Take My Scars), but he's never really tried to prove himself. That's of course worked to the bands advantage cause he's always been suiting, but yeah and what not.\n\nOf course, Phil still owns in the lead work. His solos are solid. He has some damn good times on this record. You can tell that he's the reason this band is far more thrash now. I wreckon being that the old Vio-Lence guitarists are again reunited, and that Phil has always been working on thrash-based stuff and will always be a thrash-based guitarist, Flynny-boy has suddenly been recharged by speed. It sounds more like he's just reliving good times. Getting back into the old habbits that he lost with Vio-Lence.\n\nMusically, this album is all that it should be. There's a definite progression in Machine Head's sound and it's pretty damn welcome. The songs are far more interesting with structure, causing some of these songs to go up to ten and a half minutes in length. The riffs at times are far more complex than anything they've done before. They have one of their best slower-paced feel-groove songs on here ('Now I Lay Thee Down'), a great tribute to Creeping Death within plenty of solid riffs and solos ('Gripping The Fist Of Dissent'), and an epic closing track that does more than remain mid-paced ('A Farewell To Arms').\n\nAny let-downs? Well, ultimately I think 'Ashes' was better. Basically, I don't bother comparing to old-school Machine Head, because that's long dead and gone now. Personally, my favourite album is 'The More Things Change'. I dig its massive latino gangster grooves, and it has some of their best tracks in groove ('Take My Scars'), thrashcore ('Struck A Nerve') and in epic ('Blood of the Zodiac', 'Spine'). Being that the first two albums are underlayed with gangster-rap based grooves, I don't think it's coming back. One Robb changed from proper gangster to white-trash wigger ('From This Day') that sound was permanently removed, and no matter how much you might want 'Burn My Eyes' (or in my case, 'Change') back, it's not coming.\n\nOf course, getting back on topic, I think 'Ashes' work a little better in its simplicity. It's great that Machine Head can finally experiment a bit more with arrangements and riffs, but 'Ashes' was so solid just due to how between the two main epics ('Imperium', 'Descends') there was plenty of massive fucking groove-thrash tracks that stood tall on individually and together. Sure, there was less thrash, less harmonies, less solo's, but I think that's what kind of made it work a little better. There was less of that and more of other stuff, thus slightly more of a nice contrast. As great as the two main epics on this album are ('Clenching', 'Farewell') and as much as they may go in places you may have wanted Machine Head to go, in their complexity they, yes, do stand tall, just not as tall as some of their previous efforts.\n\nOne thing that has bothered me, but hast taken me a while to figure out is the metalcore influence. The music itself on this album doesn't really hold much resemblence to metalcore, and could probably stand tall on its own if it weren't for the vocals. As strong and suiting the vocals are, there is plenty of big Killswitch-style vocal harmonies on this album, and it sort of throws you off. Not in a bad way mind you, cause they're quite suitable, but more of in the way that it's sort of unexpected. I realised how this bothers me though. As happy as I am with the bands progression on this album, this isn't the album I wanted Machine Head to release. No, no. This is the album I wanted Killswitch Engage to release.\n\nKillswitch started off with their first major label debut 'Alive or Just Breathing', and created a big amount of hype due to their at the time unique sound. Suddenly, out goes Jesse and in comes Howard and they release 'The End Of Heartache', and though it's damn good, it's not quite as good. Still, it works very well and stands damn strong. Then they release their new album, and though the formula has changed a bit (less chugga-chugga breakdowns, more diversity in vocal structure), it's just another Killswitch Engage album essentially. Saying that, my problem with the new Machine Head is the fact that this is not the album I wanted Machine Head to release, but rather wanted Killswitch Engage to release. It has enough in it to remain faithful to Killswitch fans, but also goes way further and dealves into other territories. I suppose as far as Machine Head goes, I was kind of hoping for more a darl-tinged thrash album. I kind of got that, but it was slightly corrupted by the date of writing and release.\n\nStill, that's a minor complaint really. The album's fucking solid, and works damn well. It's definitely worth checking out. The only thing I'm curious about is how this shit goes down live. I suppose with time we're to find out.\n\nLouis Gaudet\n",
        "\nFew things in life can match the utter crap that is Machine Head's 1999 catastrophe \"The Burning Red.\" Now you might think I'm being a bit carried away for such a bold statement, but coming from a devoted metalhead, I mean every word of it. The last thing I EVER wanted to hear was a nu-metal album, and that's exactly what \"The Burning Red\" is. Everything from the easy guitar playing, to the deep distortion, to the rapping vocals, and even the angst lyrics plague this record from start to finish.\n\nIt seems Machine Head thought it would be cool to completely disown their groove thrash sound and replace it with mainstream rock. The repugnant riffs are composed of standard nu-metal worship with little variation or variety. The simple guitar structure is repeated quite frequently as there is just one effortless riff for each song that repeats over and over until it finally ends. The drumming takes a big dump on any possible enjoyment as every track has the same simple drum pattern with minimal changes. And did I mention there aren't any guitar solos throughout the painful course of this LP? It becomes painfully obvious within seconds of listening that \"The Burning Red\" isn't metal, but a total mallcore sellout. If Korn and Machine Head decided to make a baby, \"The Burning Red\" would be the foul offspring.\n\nJust when you think this record couldn't get any worse, you hear Robert Flynn and his rapping vocal style. The Machine Head frontman decided to hop on the trendy bandwagon by rapping over the mallcore riffs to make \"The Burning Red\" a sellout of the ages. All the rhyming and rapping he does sounds disgraceful, embarrassing, and even humorous at times. Flynn also makes some attempts at singing, but he just sounds like a generic grunge singer. I'm not sure if Flynn wanted to be a Fred Durst clone or some alternative rock clown when he sang on this record, but he sounds atrocious overall and his new vocal attempts should have avoided in the first place. I can't believe the same guy who sang on \"Burn My Eyes\" was responsible for making such an abominable vocal performance!\n\nI've heard some terrible stuff before, but none of that can match the utter repulsiveness of this album. Machine Head have thankfully returned to their metal roots in recent times, yet this abomination is still a friendly reminder of what Robert Flynn and company wanted to become. Spend your money on something you'll actually enjoy and avoid \"The Burning Red\" like you would a rabid dog.\n\nThis review was written for: http://www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nFrom the looks of it I thought this was going to be Machine Head\u2019s best album. The songs were long (I like long epic songs) and I liked their latest release a lot better than everything they did before it. Things looked promising and it turned out to be their best indeed. Of course this is good thing but I still felt disappointed by it since it\u2019s far from the masterpiece I hoped for. \n\nThe album starts with an intro which sounds very promising and after a minute or so the album actually starts with a burst out into a riff. And here is where things go wrong; although it doesn\u2019t sound bad it\u2019s just mediocre riff with mediocre vocals by Rob. The song evolves and a solo turns up which is, well how do I say it, incredible. I always loved their soloing and this is top-notch shredding here. The song closes with some more mediocre riffing and singing by Rob and leaves me pretty much unimpressed. The song is 10 minutes and although it\u2019s not bad (the solo was obviously the best part) it just isn\u2019t very good either. It can tell you the same with the second song, mediocre riffs, cool solo and sometimes even whiney annoying vocals. Third song, same story but it\u2019s a notch better. \nNow starts the fourth song and the album finally becomes a little more interesting. The vocals are better here and most importantly the riffs are actually something worthwhile to listen to. Not something to write home about but it\u2019s a step up from the start. \n\nThe albums second half is immediately of to a bad start with Slanderous. To be quite frank it\u2019s a horrible song and that\u2019s mostly due the lyrics \u201cI love you, why do I hate my father. I hate you, why do I hate myself\u201d. What, are they an emo band now? Thank God it doesn\u2019t get any worse than this and luckily for Machine Head they close the album with 3 actual good songs. All of them surpass the 9 minutes mark, have long intros and extended solos but hey I love that in music so no problemo. Wolves is by far the best song on this album with good riffs and excellent solos, so that pushes this album lot higher than it would have been without this song.\n\nSo all in all, this is a good release but as you\u2019ve read I have a lot of mixed feelings about it. The vocals aren\u2019t good most of the time and they sometimes tend to sound very whiney. The riffs are mediocre although some are actually somewhat good. The reason I still gave it a 67 is because there is a nice vibe flowing trough this album. It\u2019s nice listening to it, even if some parts aren\u2019t that good, the solos are great most of the time though. The feeling I get with this album is that Machine Head took a lot more time with this album. They tried to mature in their song writing and they succeeded in that since the songs are well composed. I also feel like they aren\u2019t jumping on any bandwagon here anymore, but try to be themselves finally. The only thing missing in this story is mind-blowing music because that\u2019s just not here. \n\nWritten for www.musicmademe.com\n",
        "\nOut of every Machine Head's albums, this one is the least talked about. Even its two follow ups get more attention though not always favorably. This album had it rough since its predecessor Burn My Eyes was so loved and breath taking to many, the follow up had a lot of expectations to meet. I think it actually met those expectations.\n\nThis album does live up to the change bit in its name but it isn't that drastic of a change. Machine Head slowed the tempo down a bit but still kept the powerful heaviness that existed on the previous album. Robb Flynn also experimented with his vocals more, such as more singing and this is the first album we hear his trademark \"YOW!\" screams. This album is hardly mallcore. There are more riffs here than what any mallcore guitarist could ever write and more than any mallcore album combined. There are plenty of guitar solos and the song structures are more inspired and worked into. I don't care if a band is \"groovy\" or what not. Black Sabbath didn't play at a million miles an hour and Tony Iommi played far more power chords than noted riffs. Doom metal is loved a lot by metal heads, even when the tempo is pretty slow and Blind Guardian's Imaginations From the Otherside had songs that weren't all just speedy guitaring and drumming. Even in Metallica's Thrash-era, their songs like \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" and \"Seek and Destroy\" had mid-tempo rhythms. Testament's \"Souls of Black\" on the title track was pretty mid-tempo and so was \"The Legacy\" on that album. Sepultura wasn't the first to start going a bit groovy and I've heard plenty of Sodom songs that weren't break neck fast. I also care about a good guitar tone instead of worrying how fast or complex I'm playing. But make no mistake, I'm not dissing thrash (nor doom metal and power metal). My favorite band is Testament and they have awesome guitar tones. I just don't think liking groove metal makes you un-metal and that speed should not matter when it comes to metal. Just as long as you have the passion for playing it and your heart is in it, that is all that should matter.\n\nRiffing highlights would be found on \"The Frontlines\" with that monstrous riff that stomps in after the long screeching wah-wah lines. The opener, \"Ten Ton Hammer\", has a pounding intro and a great shout along chorus. The following track, \"Take my Scars\", has a mean groove and a crazy solo. The vocal harmony in the chorus is undeniably good as well. \"Down to None\" has a unique dark and melodic intro. The best track, \"Spine\", allows each band member to shine. It begins with Adam Duce playing a creepy and dark bass solo which is followed by Robb and Logan Mader churning out surging and heavy riffs. Dave McClain, who was new at the time, beats the skins like a mad man in that section and during the melodic verses, plays a Sepulturian tribal beat. Robb sings low and emotionally but shouts wildly in the chorus with my favorite lyrics on the album (I see right through your soul! Can't help but feel this cold! But this city made me so!). The bridge is massive and features many chameleon-esque passages that you would never find in any mallcore album. It starts doomy, churns up a bit, and births out an atmospheric and melodic solo above a groovy rhythm. After the solo, it calms down though after a long while, the doomy riffs kick back in and a wicked solo ends it.\n\nThe shorter songs on this album make up in punch for what they lack in length. \"Struck a Nerve\" has fast stop-go riffs with the bass being used a fill in the manner a drum fill would do. \"Bay of Pigs\" is the most intense in terms of speed. Unrelentless riffs, guitar squals, double bass, and growls come at you non-stop during the verses. The chorus is a bit anthem-ish and the bridge has a great whirling groove. \"Blistering\" has some awkard lyrics (I don't care because I don't give a fuck!) but the freakin heavy riffing and drumming saves it.\n\n\"Violate\" is the darkest, most progressive, and personal song on the album. It is Robb reflecting on someone who abused him and how he desires revenge for it.\nIt goes from a grueling riff to a melodic chorus, repeat, and than flat out chaos for the rest of the song. The final track, \"Blood of the Zodiac\", shows Machine Head's melodic side very well and ending the album in a different way. It started heavy but ended with the beast finally founding peace.\n\nThis album is a treasure for metal heads who don't mind having groove here and there and see that sound is more important than speed.\n",
        "\nMachine Head's debut is one definately one of the good ones. Robb Flynn proves himself to be a great musician, as Machine Head rocks the house with this one.\n\nRiffing is obviously MH's highlight. The riffs are mainly guitar driven, and consists of bass-treble picking (you'll get it when you hear), which have become Machine head's trademark. The bass is steady and gives a solid groove and background to the riffs. Even though they are not complex constructions, the riffs are a good effort and not just background.\n\nThe songs are constructed in such way that when a good riff shows up, the vocals step down. More in that matter are the quiet parts in the songs that seem to be widespread in nowadays Metalcore and Nu-Metal (and are the reason for the downscoring). So this album is probably one of the roots of this epidemic, but I forgive MH because they kick ass!\n\nLogan Mader also kicks ass here. Although not every song has solo, most of them do, and Mader does not dissappoint and the solos are quite good. Mader seems to put a lot of thought and feel in them, although Flynn's riff underneath is often simple, maybe to accent the solo.\n\nThe drumming is more than fair, and does not let down. Chris knows when to take the stage but doesn't often does. When he does he shows feel, yet keeps in order and doesn't get too wild. When the guitar takes the stage, the drumming is in perfect mach and accurate. Even when the riff is ultra-fast (the ending of \"A Nation of Fire\" for example) - Chris kicks ass.\n\nThe production is accurate and solid. Every instrument sounds great and Machine Head talent sounds to its full extent. \"Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies\" is an exception, then the Riff sounds underneath the noise and a bit spoils, but in overall its a good track.\n\nIn total summery, \"Burn My Eyes\" consitutes Machine Head's sound for the future, and it is for the best. The riffs rock, the solos are great, and even though there are these quiet parts, the album gives you a full Machine Head experience.\n",
        "\nMachine Head\u2019s 1999 full-length, 'The Burning Red', contains a number of flaws, notably it\u2019s inconsistent style. Is it meant to be a rapcore album, or is it merely an expansion of Machine Head\u2019s early thrash style? Were they just trying something new, or was this a band content to jump the shark and market themselves to angst ridden pre-teens? Is it okay for a metal band to cover The Police, or does it make you a complete pansy?\n\nMemories of the rather directionless 'The More Things Change\u2026' are evoked on tracks such as \u201cSilver\u201d and \u201cExhale the Vile\u201d. The sludgy riffs never really take off into the doom-laden territory they were searching for, and Robb Flynn\u2019s growling vocals are stuck in second gear. Meanwhile, in both an interesting and disconcerting turn away from Machine Head\u2019s style of the past, \u201cDesire to Fire\u201d and \u201cFrom This Day\u201d utilise pseudo-rap vocals, and it becomes all too clear why the band sought Mr. Nu-metal, Ross Robinson, to produce this album. Both extremes simply do not co-exist well in the same universe.\n\nHowever, amid the chaos, there are some hidden gems that should not be overlooked. Pure chest-beating anthems such as \u201cThe Blood, The Sweat, The Tears\u201d and \u201cI Defy\u201d, while not as powerful as a \u201cDavidian\u201d, are notable pretenders to the throne. \u201cNothing Left\u201d features a slow-burning groove that meanders around innocently until the climax, when the stick of dynamite explodes and the band goes completely bonkers. The closing title track is the closest thing to a ballad on this album, and shows that Mr. Flynn can croon with the best of them.\n\nThe \u2018heaviest\u2019 track, in terms of content, is clearly \u201cFive\u201d. An emotional song about a five year old boy being sexually abused, the lead singer has admitted in a few interviews that the lyrics are autobiographical. Despite the nu-metal influences on this album, the singer sounds anything but \u2018whiny\u2019 on \u201cFive\u201d as he bellows \u201cYou molest and destroy just a five year old boy - And you made me suffer, motherfucker!\u201d The words aren\u2019t exactly erudite in their approach, but they come straight from the heart and it\u2019s hard for this reviewer to find fault in that.\n\nOverall, 'The Burning Red' is not a very good album to listen to from start to finish, but it does contain some great individual tracks that would be worth the price of an iTunes download. For newcomers, Machine Head is a band worth exploring if you like your metal with an accessible edge to it, but 'Burn My Eyes' is still arguably the best place to start your collection. And... no, you're not a pansy if you like The Police...\n",
        "\n\"Machine Head? I liked the band better when they were Vio-Lence.\"\n\"Rob Flynn was better in Forbidden.\"\n\"They only have one good album.\"\n\"That shit's Nu-Metal.\"\n\"He raps.\"\n\nShut the fuck up. Seriously. \n\nMachine Head are, and always will be, a unit that caters to Robert Flynn's current likes and dislikes. The whole you are what you eat philosophy, except musicians consume music. It's the same thing with Machine Head. I mean, am I the only one that doesn't see why \"Imperium\" had a tremolo section, taking into consideration what the current music trend was? Metalcore. Killswitch Engage. Tremolo fucking riffing.\n\nI've been a Machine Head fan since I was first introduced to harder Metal by way of Darkane, and I still have a lot of fondness for the band. Just like every other Metalhead, I did not like \"The Burning Red\" or some of \"Supercharger,\" though that album is highly underrated and overly-slagged. However, I was as astonished and rewarded as any Metal fanatic would've been to hear this album, Machine Head returning to a Thrashier sound at their core, whilst maintaining some experimental aspects. The point is that they experiment. Yeah, they tried integrated Nu into their Groove sound, because it was only the next logical step. Instead, Machine Head induct a new ethic of experimenting with some foreign sounds. \n\nAnd I do mean foreign. There's a lot of a Swedish and Finnish influence on this album; just check out the tremolo passage in \"Imperium\" that made every Machine Head fanatic drop a jaw. Or, the US bonus track(Which we fucking deserved. Fuck you very much, Roadrunner), \"Seasons Wither.\" There's also some experimentation with more Sludgey music, as in the track \"Elegy.\" The point here is that the music on this album isn't a \"Return to their core,\" it's Machine Head scoring a hit with their experimentation rather than a miss. They've found their niche, and that's what we've pretty much all been waiting on. What's going on with this album is more than just Groove, it's a band tampering with their sound as much as possible and producing excellent results by successfully compounding influences. Songs like \"Imperium\" and \"In the Presence of My Enemies\" are destined to be two songs Machine Head will break out live several times, and fans'll sing to by heart, while songs like \"Vim\" and \"Descend the Shades of Night\" continue to reveal aspects of Machine Head that are more than just standard Post-Thrash or Groove. \n\nIf you don't like this album, you're a shitty elitist. Honestly. There's too much that's going on underneath this album to dismiss it as petty Nu-Metal bullshit, and if that's what you see, I suggest picking up a book or a guitar.\n",
        "\nThis album was a big hype in late 2003. Many reviews were praising, proclaiming how Machine Head had gone back to their roots. It was supposed to be a second Burn your Eyes. Machine Head had been Nu-Metal for quite a while before the release of this album. And then Imperium blessed my ears. A great song. Unlike other Machine Head songs, this was pure metal. Groovy riffs, fast metal drumming. Simply put, an awesome track. \n\nBut Alas, the rest of the album, the so hailed come back, does not compare to the opening track. Plenty of promising tracks. Bite the bullet and others contain some great riffs, and Vim has a sweet solo that showcases a lot of skill, but the songs don't seem to go anywhere. Most of them are not memorable at all. The songwriting just isn't what it should be. McClain's drumming is great, Flynn however tries too much to sound angry and his vocals just don't flow with the music and this effects to the elimination of any chance of a good tune. Many of the nu-metal elements of earlier times pop up as well, and they just don't mix the groove metal. \n\nThe conclusion is that Machine Head has some skilled musicians and they have the potential to make a good album, but this is disappointing. Still three stars for this one, because of Imperium and because of the improvement they have made and hopefully they'll be a full-fledged metal band soon, once again.\n",
        "\nThis album is overrated by many and underrated by others. I can safely say I\u2019m middle ground. While it isn\u2019t bad, and it definitely is Machine Head\u2019s best album (to date and probably till the end of time) and shows the potential the band initially had before they stripped themselves of it \u2013 it suffers from rabid inconsistencies and poor songwriting. \n\nAbsolutely everything is simplistic here. The ultra-fast, sonic riffs of Vio-lence are completely missing, and the band also sounds haphazard and tired. The solos, whenever they occur are absolutely nothing to scream about. The drumming is decent but underwhelming. Vocally, Robb Flynn has a hardcorish bark but his inefficacy doesn't detract from the music here. On a lyrical level, this is quite a different MH from modern MH. The lyrics here employ a \u2018tough as nails\u2019 image quite different from the \u2018I hate you, I hate you\u2019 mallcore nonsense MH palms off as \u2018lyrics\u2019 these days but in the end these lyrics aren\u2019t any more intelligent than their new stuff.\t\n\nThe album starts off very well. Davidian is a half-thrash classic (hah!) with some ultra-heavy riffing, simple but effective song structure and a thick, raw underlying groove. Old is faster and pretty much follows in the same vein but is spoilt by that awful clean chorus. Even \u2018A Thousand Lies\u2019 is decent although it is excessively repetitive. \u2018None But My Own\u2019 is where the album sinks, what were they attempting at with this? \u2018The Rage to Overcome\u2019 is another oddball song. Then, \u2018Death Church\u2019 and \u2018A Nation On Fire\u2019 go all slow on you. I know variety makes the music better, but it only serves to ruin things when you can\u2019t manage it. \u2018Blood For Blood\u2019 returns to the old sound and is a decent track. \u2018I\u2019m Your God Now\u2019 is an attempt to break into the mainstream and sounds incredibly lame. \u2018Real Eyes, Realise, Real Eyes\u2019 is a completely unnecessary instrumental. The closer, \u2018Block\u2019 is much faster than the rest of the album and is in the same league as Davidian and Old though admittedly, it isn\u2019t as interesting. \n\nIn conclusion, this seems to be quite a confused release. While it seems keen to stay in the Pantera half-thrash camp, it also meddles dangerously with Biohazard-esque riffing and there are also moments where the band goes entirely mallcore. Therefore one can say, Robb Flynn left Vio-lence for their own good as his haphazard, strange ideas certainly didn\u2019t fit into a band of that style and would have ruined the fondness with which they are remembered today.\n\nVerdict : Definitely MH's best, though that isn't saying much.\n",
        "\nBefore you even say anything about the rating, I'll let you know one thing about why I gave it a pretty decent score. For one, despite the nu-metal possessed in this CD, this is waaaay better then anything else Machine Head released. Yup, you heard me; this is better then \"Burn In My Eyes\" or \"The More Things Change!\" Call me crazy (and I could give a rats ass if you think so,) but this is Machine Head's best CD.\n\nFor starters, let\u2019s look at the music itself. Compare this to their pass releases and the songs structures, melodies and so on are far better here then the first two albums. In the past, the songs were alright (half alright at most) with the slow and boring riffs presented. Yeah those riffs might be heavier x12 than the ones presented in \"The Burning Red\" but that doesn't make a release grand. The vocals sounded pretty hoarse in the past and not well practiced whereas on this release, Rob Flynns voice sounds well laid out (yeah, even those \"rapcore\" moments sound good and structured well into each song.) Overall on comparison, despite the mallcore tendencies on this album, I must say this is much more enjoyable and headbangable (yes, I said headbangable) to listen to than the last two very mediocre,\u201d yawnful\u201d releases. \n\nMoving onto this CD, yes it is plain flat out the sellout album for Machine Head, but if you were really thinking about it, this was coming because \"The More Things Change\" had no direction and vibe to it. Sure, why not jump on the bandwagon and become \"hip\" and \"cool\" like most of the bands were becoming during that time. The metal scene was deteriorating, and Machine Head decided to be like Korn, Limp Bizkit and so on with this album... but ironically, as I stated before, this release is not bad... not bad at all. Let's get one thing cleared up here (for those of you who are too \"tr00,\" just skip this part because you have your ideologies of being strictly metal, so yeah skip this please before I get a ton of hatemail!): I feel there's a difference between truly bad nu-metal and the decent, more enjoyable nu-metal. \"The Burning Red\" is one of those enjoyable nu-metal albums, possessing some metallic qualities and yeah, doesn't have someone whining about his life or anything like that. No, I'm not a fan of nu-metal, but I'll be honest with you that this was one of my first \"metal\" CD's to buy, and up to this day I still occasionally pop this into my boom box. Its nu-metal that does have some creativity behind it and just doesn't repeat power chords or have crap-ass lyrics.\n\n(Okay, if you skipped all that above, now you can proceed reading here.) Sure, there are such songs like \"Desire To Fire\" which has that cheesy rapcore feel to it, with Rob sort of laying down some rhymes in the beginning, but it isn't Limp Bizkit rapping or anything like that (and if it was, then this release wouldn't such a high rating.) If you're really looking for some per-se old school Machine Head, then the next song \"Nothing Left\" and \"I Defy\" would somehow satisfy your taste buds. They're pretty metallic; \"Nothing Left\" has a pretty catchy riff and beat to it and ends with intensity. \"I Defy\" though is all out a mosh pit song with a real punky feel to it (especially at the near end of the song, the riffs and beat begins to speed up and it will guarantee some headbangs.) One thing I know most people criticize about this CD is the single \"From This Day\" which has nu-metal written all over it. Ha, I hate to be honest, but that was the song which got me into the band to begin with! It's one of the best songs on the album despite the nu-metal behind it (c'mon, just because something isn't metal doesn't mean it sucks ya know?) It's really watered down, but still it has one hell of a catchy riff to it, catchy lyrics and chorus (yes, this is another rapcore song) and yeah it stays stuck in your head. Everything else on the CD isn't that bad, but the rest of the songs are more of the same.\n\nThink about this: Do you really like Machine Head's old stuff? If you don't, then maybe you should take a risk and listen to this album because it isn't as bad as people make it to be. The reason most people are bashing this is because they can only tolerate metal music, and/or they actually did like old Machine Head, and they see the band as a sellout now. I'm neutral on this one, so I guess that's why I enjoy the CD. I agree though that the band did sell out and went all mallcore, but then again I never really liked old Machine Head and it's under the bands will if they wanna be conformists or not. \n\nIt's like I said before, just because something isn't metal doesn't mean that it sucks. Besides, it's about the music, not image (wow I really sounded like a Hot Topic kid saying that; lemme stop here hehe.)\n\nEar Candy: From This Day, Nothing Left, I Defy...\n",
        "\nIf you want to hear Rob Flynn play thrash, go listen to Vio-lence. Machine Head has never attempted to play thrash. So this album should not be judged in accordance with some sort of unwritten thrash rulebook.\n\nFor what this album is, lying somewhere between mid-era Pantera, mid-era Metallica, and the last couple of Max-era Sepultura albums (sans tribalism), it is quite good. The first two songs, Davidian and Old, reallly get the album started. Both are extremely catchy, but still heavy, making me want to jump out of my chair and go find the nearest pit. I mean, how can you not love a song where at the peak of the chorus, Rob bellows \"Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast.\" The rest of the album follows in pretty much the same manner, catchy, heavy, and groovy. \n\nThe drumming is excellent. If they hadn't found this guy to play drums for them, then yes, this would have been a much more mediocre album. I suppose that it is Rob's band, and he definitely has a concept of how he wanted this album to sound, but the drummer really carries the album. The guitar work is OK. It really isn't anything to brag about by itself, but this is not intended to be a flashy album guitar-wise. It merely serves the purpose of providing heaviness. About on par with latter day Obituary. Rob's vocals are about the same. They exist to serve the music, not to steal the spotlight. And he does actually sing some. It is not terrible, but I was introduced to Machine Head through The Burning Red, so I was already accustomed to Rob singing.\n\nAnyways, if you just enjoy heavy, catchy music, then check this album out. It won't change your life, but you just might get caught banging your head a few times.\n",
        "\nI've heard mixed reviews of this album and you either love it or you hate it. I personally love it. This is not \"same shit, different year\", as it sounds absolutely nothing like any of Machine Head's other releases.\n\nNearly everyone knows how after Burn My Eyes Machine Head went in a mallcore direction, but hell, they've made up for it here. Sure, it's not Thrash, but does that make it bad? Hell no.\n\nThis is just damn groovy as hell and even if I tried to hate it I couldn't. Sure, there are bands that do Groove badly, like Pantera for example, but that doesn't make every other Groove band bad. This is Groove, not mallcore and I'd laugh as hard at anyone who said that as I would to the people who tell me Reign In Blood is the best Slayer album.\n\nThis isn't another Burn My Eyes. It's closer to it than their other releases, but if you put any Through The Ashes Of Empire track on Burn My Eyes it would stick out like a sore thumb. Rob Flynn's vocals are the same as on their past three albums and the production has a very modern sound, yet it has the Groove of Burn My Eyes.\n\nMachine Head have finally gone back to making the music how they want to, not how Roadrunner Records feel they should to sell records in the masses.\n\nSimply put, if you liked Burn My Eyes, then you should like this. If you can't stand Groove, then don't bother.\n",
        "\nMachine Head's 1994 debut seems very much a love/hate album. It also happens to be one of my all time favourite albums, and I find it's style to be rather unique.\n\nOne of the main complaints of most people who dislike this album is that it isn't true thrash metal. This is true, it isn't thrash metal at all, and the real problem here is that these people were expecting something different to what they got.\n\nThis album throws aside a lot of the traditional characteristics of metal - complex guitars, stretched out songs, and replaces it with all out aggression. No bullshit complicity here, this is simple metal best characterised by the opening track Davidian. Simple riffs, double bass and clean but aggressive vocals form an unrelenting monster of a song. Later tracks, such as Old, A Thousand Lies and A Nation On Fire incorporate more melodic elements into them, but use a similar formula. The songs flow perfectly, no irellevant stuff in the middle of them.\n\nI have 3 complaints about this album however. The first is a few songs have unnecessarilly long, and quite frankly shit, filler intros. Examples of this are I'm Your God Now, which has a minute or so of repetative bass before the vocals even start, and Blood For Blood which takes 48 seconds of stupid screeches before the song starts properly. Another is that some of the solos aren't too good. While songs like the aforementioned I'm Your God Now and Death Church have nice solos that fit the pace and tune of the song, others, and in particular Davidian, are far too downtuned and sound like more of a drone. My last complaint is track 10, Real Eyes Realize Real Lies. Congratulations, you wrote a riff and played some sounds on top of it, now get rid of this filler crap.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a great album, and if you have an open mind and aren't expecting thrash metal, you may like it. Definately listen to a couple of songs before you buy it.\n",
        "\nMachine Head have a terrible track record. One decent album, one terribly below average album, and 2 pieces of worthless dog crap. Where does this new-ish one sit? Well, I'll put it just above worthless dog crap.\n\nAlbum starts off with Imperium, the only outright good song. It's rather long but that's because it builds up and has a few different sections to it. The build up sounds cool, the marching snare sound has been done before many, many times though. Come to think of it, that's what I'd say about this album, done before and many, many times at that. Back to the song. After building up we hit a pretty decent groove riff with some mindless shouting about rebellion etc. There are some clean vocals, not like the last couple Machine Head albums though... It's not whiney and it's not rapping, they're just kind of melodic clean vocals, not all that well done but I guess they do add some variation. Eventually there's a part that reminds me a whole hell of a lot of Davidian, then into a gothenburg \"thrash\" style fast part. The song is actually pretty sweet and has some good changes. Too bad the rest of the album is just really bad.\n\nAs for the rest of the album, Left Unfinished is interesting probably because it's really the only uptempo song on the album. The chorus isn't sung particularly well but it's a good melody. Every other song on here is pretty much mid-paced or slow and just drags on and on and on and on. Then it happens, you slowly close your eyes only for them to snap open what seems like seconds later, to find out it's been about a half hour later and the album is over. \n\nWorth owning? No.\n",
        "\nThe Burning Red was actually the first album I purchased from these guys. Was that a bad introduction or what? Fortunately, I picked up Burn My Eyes about a year later, and I am blown away by the results.\n\nThis album is not very melodic, but the music is very aggressive. The production is also pretty good, thanks to Colin Richardson (Fear Factory). It's not exactly thrash, but it's close. Songs like \"Blood For Blood\", \"Old\" and \"Davidian\" have some pretty mind-numbing riffs, and the drumming is very fast. Man, I wish they would write more music like this, instead of the pieces of shit that were The Burning Red and Supercharger. Plus, the lyrics of \"A Thousand Lies\" (in the third verse), are both ahead of and behind their time, dealing with the atrocities committed by both Bush administrations - very inspired lyrics. \"Old\" has a very nice bass run in the beginning of it, only to be followed with heavy guitars from Rob Flynn and Logan Mader. \"The Rage To Overcome\" has an excellent guitar solo about midway through (yes, this album has guitar solos, kiddies!), as does the aforementioned \"A Thousand Lies\" and \"Old\". \"Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies\" is full of sound bites taken from the era of the Rodney King beatings on top of some really good guitar playing - once again, very inspired stuff. \"I'm Your God Now\", \"Death Church\", and \"A Nation On Fire\" are of the slower variety, with the latter track ending on a fast note. Once again, tremendously good stuff!\n\nAll of these songs show Machine Head at their peak, and what a peak it is! Outstanding musicianship, very inspired songwriting, and good production are all reasons why you owe yourself to pick this one up... today!\n",
        "\nTo those saying this is a return to the old times - perhaps you are right. However, it is not a return to the only good thing that band ever did, namely Davidian. Listen to Davidian and see how it just fucking works on some levels. Sure, it's groove as fuck, but it's got decent riffs and it MOVES ALONG in a straightforward fashion, each step anticipating the next correctly. In short, it does not drag.\n\nNow, this entire album fucking drags, and drags hard. It goes around in circles, it goes nowhere, and pretty much is the equivalent of fingernails on chalkboard. Slow, irritating, and you just want it to fucking stop. \n\nThere's pretty much one decent song on here, and even it's not that great... that is the opener, Imperium. It seems like \"Davidian, except with stupid interludes thrown in\". Yes indeed, you have some melodic bullshit parts, thrown in for no reason. Plus you have the 'classic' Machine Head squeal guitars, which come in for no reason to distract things. Too much fucking on the tremolo bar, not enough music.\n\nOh yeah, then you have the vocals. Robb Flynn attempts a Mike Patton, going through every possible way to suck. You hear the fuckhead BREATHE for crying out loud. Isn't that taught in Singing 101? Breathe away from the microphone. The vocals are just far the fuck too loud in the mix, and we occasionally have the cringe-worthy moment where it's JUST VOCALS. Yeah, no mallcore to be found anywhere? Riiiight. \n\nFor example, All Falls Down could've been on the last MH album. It's complete shit. You get the stupid non-distorted guitar bullshit with loud vocals over them, and then you have the pre-chorus which has an actual riff, and then you have the chorus, which drags on with the long vocal notes 'driving' the passage, but really going nowhere.\n\nAs I said, that's the theme of the album. Going nowhere. Total modern-rock bullshit with the occasional mallcore section. Avoid if you have any sensibility.\n",
        "\nThis album is total and utter mallcore. The typical pattern of \"let's drop out the guitars and accentuate the vocals\" is there in pretty much every song. There are no riffs, just random \"melodic\" fills under the choruses that alternate with just-about-rapped verses. Every once in a while there is an almost decent middle section, but by almost decent I mean not even as good as the first Machine Head album, which was at least solid half-thrash.\n\nOkay, yeah there are a few thrash riffs here and there, but a thrash album this does not make... for example the song \"Bulldozer\" starts off with a thrash riff, but then turns into halfthrash immediately in, and then ... well, there goes the riff to be replaced by random noises, and here come the verses!! Then more random noises, the occasional \"groove\" moment with the half-as-fast halfthrash riff. \n\nAs for the occasional \"ballad goes heavy\" - well, most every song is like that. You have the 'soft' verses, and the distorted chorus. Really, if you've heard Korn, or Deftones, or whatever is the rage today in mallcore, then you've heard this. You've got the whiney vocals, the distorted vocals, the simple percussive guitar patterns, everything is here... it really reminds me most of old Coal Chamber, but okay since I'm familiar with like five mallcore bands, that's probably not the most accurate comparison. Note that I can't say that it reminds me of any metal bands... well, maybe some older Machine Head, but even that is not there.\n\nOh and one more thing... \"I AM THRASH, AND I AM NOT HERE\". There are some faster songs, and more thrash riffs than on the previous album, but in order to be considered a thrash album you need to have more than the OCCASIONAL thrash riff here and there. If most of the songs are in the mallcore style, then this will be declared a mallcore album. Just the presence of stupid pseudo-industrial noises, lots of heavy breathing, total mallcore-styled vocals, and other stupid bullshit to fill in the space between the approximately two minutes of total riffs that are on this album...\n\nThis isn't even a half-thrash album like the first Machine Head album. This is, as I mentioned before... utter and complete mallcore. Want proof? Go to their website, download the songs - at least they're cool enough to have some songs available to warn people off.\n",
        "\nThis album loses even more of the riffs and turns into a dangerously groove-filled environment. Lots of Korn influence on here. The last album couldn't be called thrash, this one barely struggles to be called metal. A lot of the features central to mallcore can be found here, and I don't just mean rapped vocals - the general idea where the guitar is de-emphasised and \"atmosphere\" is attempted through the use of slowing down the song and inserting some whiney vocals.\n\nThe drumwork is actually the saving grace of the album, and what keeps it barely metal. There is some decent double-bass to be found here, and if it weren't so damn emphasised in the mix at the expense of the guitars, it would be a nice backdrop. \n\nA highly questionable album. This band just gets shittier and shittier. Insert here the obligatory note of how Vio-lence is so much fucking better.\n",
        "\nOkay, let this be a lesson to all concerned. If you sound like this, then you are not thrash.\n\nReally. Thrash is, maybe not always faster, but definitely more riff-oriented (if you want to hear midpaced thrash, check out Artillery's first demo).\n\nMost of the stuff on this album is pretty much what can best be considered \"half-thrash\", in that it's halfway to thrash. The songs build up to a certain point, and there are riffs here and there, but the riffs are not overt enough, or choppy enough, to be fully thrash. What they really sound like are very watered-down speed metal riffs (same note, over and over again), slowed down a bit, and, most importantly reduced in the mix to accent the drums, thereby totally losing their edge. Throw in some Pantera-esque yelled vocals - generally midpaced and monotone, lacking distinction... oh and of course, every once in a while, stop the guitars entirely. \n\nAnd, frankly, that style of music blows ass. You take a perfectly good genre of music, and poop on it. There really is no good reason why, other than \"it hadn't been done before\". New shit is still shit. That's just how the world works. It's music like this that is the precursor to fucking mallcore. Look what you've done, you goddamn imbeciles. You took thrash and speed metal and turned it into this swill. Stupid squeal guitar, awful clean vocals, and other derivatives of modern filth that are pretty much a rebellion against common sense.\n\nThe highlights... well, the album actually starts off pretty decent. Davidian is a very good song. Even Old has its moments, and starts off quite promising. However, when it gets to that horrendous chorus, with its stomach-ache vocals, the album is unforgiveably corrupted. Then there's stupid interludes like \"Real Eyes\", and did I mention the fact that Flynny should NEVER EVER try clean vocals?? \"I'm Your God Now\" is basically grunge.\n\nSo if you like your music boring, slowed down, and generally uninspired, this is the band for you. People that actually think this is the be-all, end-all of Robb Flynn are strongly encouraged to check out Eternal Nightmare and Oppressing the Masses. \n\nI leave it up to you to figure out the name of the band.\n"
