        "\nI usually say that every album Trivium does showcases a single thing. Ascendancy was more of a \"riffy\" album, if you will, with the riffs on Pull Harder, Like Light To The Flies or Suffocating Sight leading the way. Shogun, considered by many to be their magnum opus (myself included) showed the virtuosity and the technicality that very few could ever pull in their early 20's. Silence In The Snow, as much as it is a product of Matt Heafy blowing his voice prior to its release, was still able to mantain the glass half-full, as it showcases Matt's unmistakable range, powerful tone and undeniable ability to do an entire clean-singing album.\n\nThe positivity and will to succeed that is found on some points of the album is also a welcome addition and overcomes the doubt that seems to appear here and there (mainly on \"Dead And Gone\", where I believe Matt uses the war metaphor to create the doubt if he's ever sing the way he did before blowing out his voice). Despite being a slower, more intimate track, \"Until The World Goes Cold\" really stands out on the album, proving that just because we're dealing with a ballad, that doesn't mean it has to be a mellow tune like the typical ballads found across music.\n\nSilence in the Snow, Dead And Gone, Until The World Goes Cold, Rise Above The Tides, The Thing That's Killing Me and Cease All Your Fire are amazing tracks that could easily feature on any Trivium record and never take anything away from it. But on the other hand, the way the songs were structured - and the album as a whole - feels pretty generic. When it comes to Silence In The Snow rarely is there anything more than the same old verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge (solo) - final chorus structure that is often explored in music. As a result, all the songs fall kind of short, in most cases after or under four minutes, and that doesn't give you the time to really appreciate their work because you have to replay them at least once more to grab that feeling.\n\nThe other fundamental abscence that really plagues this record is Corey's screaming back vocals. I believe, considering how the record came to be, that the band wanted to show solidarity towards the situation that affected Matt's voice, and not only is that understandable as it shows how much of a family they are to each other. But Corey's screams - while not being as perfect and powerful as Matt's - really provide Trivium's songs with a more powerful vocal line, and in some cases with a healthy contrast with Matt's powerful and melodic cleans. The way I see it, the intention was to highlight Matt's vocal power and show us that not everything is lost when you can't do something - in his case, screams. But had Corey provided backing screams on any of the aforementioned tunes and its boredom and repetitive nature would certainly go away as we would have something to actually look forward to.\n\nSilence In The Snow is - along with Vengeance Falls - the lowest point of Trivium's career, but even amongst the chaos of Matt not being able to utilize his voice to its full potential the band still did a pretty solid and enjoyable work. I don't mean to be biased but I highly doubt any other band under the same circumstances would have the courage to pull the worst - yet pretty worth listening - album of their career. It's not an easy antithesis to pull out of your pocket, and it proves there's still some beauty in the snow.\n",
        "\nMy story with Trivium is curious and funny altogether, having its fair share of backs and forths. I discovered them in 2009 thanks to videogame soundtracks (SmackDown vs RAW 2010 had \"Down From The Sky\" taken out of their 2008 magnum opus Shogun) but I happened to be fairly new to music as I was only 10 at the time, and I was starting to put my musical approach into shape. Thanks to that I fell off their bandwagon until 2016, when I already considered myself a metalhead, and haven't stopped following them ever since.\n\nSo, here we are, witnessing the release of their 10th studio effort and joying more and more as they are entronized pratically every single month of the year as the greatest modern metal band nowadays, and perhaps one of the greatest metal bands ever. Seeing how much they have grown over the past few years I was expecting a banger of an album, and they surely didn't disappoint. I personally have seen them try to cross the boundaries of many metal subgenres (especially since the release of The Sin And The Sentence in 2017) but I would've never thought that a blend between heavy, thrash, symphonic and somewhat death metal would serve them so well. The symphonic lines kinda give the album a majestic feel - which is totally appropriate, considering the title of the album and the story behind its title track.\n\nThere is a lot of good things one can unpack in ITCOTD - whether it is the catchy and sing-alongy choruses, or the aforementioned symphonic touches, or the slow-tempo-fast-tempo changes you can find in Shadow Of The Abattoir, or even the unexpected but amazing outro hook on The Phalanx - I think you will relish and rejoice on those easter eggs they crafted for us.\n\nOn the other hand, as I progressed through the second half of the record, I found some songs to be too unoriginal or generical - \"No Way Back Just Through\" and \"From Dawn to Decadence\". The first one is still a good effort, because in spite of its simplistic structure, the guitar work, the vocals, its overall vibe - its still pretty energetic. I found the latter to be a little too repetitive lyrics-wise, but the catchy and easily memorable chorus it posesses is kind of a compensation prize.\n\nTo sum it up, I think this really has the ability to stand as one of Trivium's best records when the band rides off into the sunset. They've put everything they offered us in TSATS and in WTDMS and mastered it to perfection, but it also seemed like they wanted to go in a darker direction of sorts. Matt's vocal ability is perhaps at its peak here, while Alex's drumming proves the man could be easily mistaken for an octopus.\n",
        "\nLet's start by establishing main song-writer Matt Heafy was 19 years old when this came out. Whatever may be said about the band Trivium, that guy is a talented musician with a really good voice, and as this record shows, was of a rare precocity. Young musicians now are coming out all the time with incredibly impressive musical abilities with top notch production and they're all over social media, but this was 2005, and in 2005, it was a certain accomplishment to have your name on an album that sounded this good not being twenty yet. By 'Ascendancy' the band were probably meaning \"turning into adults\", subconsciously.\n\nOf course, that youth shows, as it would be evident in parts to even someone that didn't know the average age of the band, that they were fairly immature. It comes across as a patchwork of past metal titans, notably Metallica or Iron Maiden (there's even a rendition of 'Master of Puppets' at the end... some lengthy song from the band \"Metallica\"). There's that over-eagerness to have leads everywhere and everything harmonized, so it lacks that parsimony and balance a ripe record will display. It often feels like, despite the good work rate on the guitars and the commendable musicianship for youngsters like these guys, a hollowness sets in because the generic twin leads make the listener feel idle after a while. \n\nAmongst the worst here, 'Dying in Your Arms' which quite frankly sounds like they're genuinely catering to teenage girls: the title alone, that hint of heaviness smoothly buffered by the sensitive chorus and clean vocals that could be heard on any radio song from those early 2000's days. It's even got the old play-the-chorus-in-a-higher-key trick towards the end. Remove the solo and this could've been a track off an Evanescence album. It must be said though, there are genuinely inspired sections on this. On 'Pull Harder...' the chorus is seriously well written stuff. It's got a gutsy start on \"It's our curse\", before soaring into a dramatic \"...that makes this world so hopeless\" with Heafy's pristine cleans, catching the listener off-guard. But then, that finish the second time around has that signature cheesy Japanese pop power-metal vibe to it and kills off the momentum. 'Drowned and Torn Asunder' exhibits the same symptom: an original chorus idea as it starts (\"Deconstructing their hold\"...), turned into cheesy cheddar cheese seconds later. That late chorus section, amongst many, sounds like some 90's cartoon theme song; the ones that tried to be exciting with a whiff of danger. And well, a whiff here and, it's cheddar cheese.\n\nIt's just not a good bet is it: radio-friendly metal, with the tough guy screaming and mean herta riffs. It's claiming some kinship to metal with its demeanor, but it's also assuming mainstream formats so... who exactly wins here ? The nu-metal and alternative bands had first implemented that closing of the gap between heavy music and the wide mainstream, but however awful some feel those might've been, they at least generally were making no allegations about belonging anywhere really, and certainly not in metal. They cut out the solos, integrated electronic or hip hop influences...they were happy doing that. With a band like Trivium, the ambiguity is there and needs to be contended with. They're essentially saying \"yes, we want the metal, but not all of it\", and instead of replacing the vacuum with something original, it's just...softer metal. Contrasting this with, say, mid-discography Soilwork when they went radio-friendlier, the song-writing was still strong and they simply shifted to a different style altogether. Meaning: if that had always been Soilwork (without a straight melodic death metal past), they would've likely just been known as a good alt metal band. The music itself wasn't ambiguous, as it is here and in metalcore at large.\n\nBands like Trivium on this basically take away all the danger and darkness and uncertainty from metal, and made it safe for all. The album cover, its title, the song structures, the riffs, the music as a whole... it's all the antithesis of what metal had been up til that point for over two decades. They're essentially de-antagonizing the genre and making it smooth and tame, domesticated one could say, turning it from its wild state into a docile puppy. It's making metal's sharp edges round and its rugged surface shiny, and replacing all of its mystery with immediate over-the-surface knowledge, that instructs no deeper reading.\n\nFinally this album is almost nostalgic in a strange sort of way. The tracks are made up of riffs you might've been coming up with yourself around that time. Those easy riffs half inspired by melodic death metal that had just one degree to them and no depth whatsoever, that sounded close enough to the real thing but in hindsight were all pink as a kitten's muzzle on the inside. Anyways it's easy to listen to. That's the bottom line and the chief factor for its success - because it was successful. The production is superb for 2005. Imagine being a twenty year old drummer kid and listening to yourself on record with a super punchy kick audible at all times, a snappy snare and that wide tom sound. The bass is distinctly crisp, the guitars totally present. It's well balanced sonically for sure, it's just young and needs to be home before 10pm, or else mister.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s no secret that Trivium has a pretty solid discography, even if a bit spotty at times. While many of my takes are on the hotter side regarding them (such as putting In Waves as my favorite), I appreciate a lot of what they do. In The Court Of the Dragon came out seemingly quickly considering just last year they unleashed What The Dead Men Say. At minimum, I can say that this doesn\u2019t feel rushed, all things considered. \n\nIn fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite, as my only real complaint here is that a few of the songs went longer than they really needed. Mostly, I only feel that way about the ones that passed the seven minute mark. I suppose it\u2019s a bit necessary, as the schtick here seems to be more medieval and mythical than usual, so I can\u2019t complain too much. But I do think \u201cThe Shadow Of Abattoir\u201d was a bit overblown and awkwardly transitioned, as was \u201cFall Into Your Hands\u201d. The makeup of that one would have worked better as a more direct blow, starting around the three minute mark. But both songs are still really enjoyable and are worth overlooking picky things like this.\n\nBut where In The Court Of The Dragon shows strength, it shows a lot. \u201cLike A Sword Over Damocles\u201d punches with an incredible chorus and lifts the screaming / chug breakdown to great heights preceding the solo. And the drums in that one? Top notch! The title track opens on a furious note, churning out their signature belts in a stellar manner, and \u201cFeast Of Fire\u201d boasts some of the most explosive basswork on the entire disc. I also think the way most of the chorus\u2019s work into the tracks is pretty smooth, namely in the shorter songs. \u201cNo Way Back Just Through\u201d confirms this near the end, if the earlier songs didn\u2019t already.\n\nFor the band as a whole, this isn\u2019t anything overly new or groundbreaking, other than the lyrical themes seeming to take a sidestep from the norm. Matt Heafy and co. have always been one of the better metalcore acts, channeling the heavy/thrash energy thoroughly, and there\u2019s no shortage of that here. For the newer fans, this isn\u2019t where I\u2019d start. For those who have been around for a while, it\u2019s absolutely worth your time.\n",
        "\nI am an avid Trivium fan. I consider Ascendancy a great metalcore album, and From Ember to Inferno is a pretty decent attempt for a first album. So, when I downloaded this for the first time in 2006, I was expecting greatness. As much as magazines like Guitar World and such would have you believe, this album is not a masterpiece. Actually, that\u2019s a lie. It is several masterpieces that Trivium has stolen. This album is simply a mash-up of many other artists\u2019 riffs, lyrical ideas and solos, thrown together in hopes of assembling something resembling an album. So, in analysing this album, I will take the time to quickly assemble a look at the album in foresight.\n\nThe album is based on Metallica, Megadeth, Motley Crue, Pantera and 1 Nevermore song. Well, in essence, I was not surprised to hear the last track. It\u2019s a complete rip-off of Dream Theater\u2019s \u201cThe Dance Of Eternity\u201d and given Matt Heafy\u2019s insistence to mention that he can play through John Petrucci\u2019s Rock Discipline DVD in every single interview he does, I\u2019m not surprised to hear a Dream Theater track. The album starts off well enough, decent riffs, a good way to open an album. However, after the first song starts, I noticed that it\u2019s basically a Megadeth song, with Hetfield vocals. Through and through, the entire song is just riff after riff stolen from Megadeth. And I thought: \u201cWell, everyone has their days\u201d\u2026 Until the next song started, and it was a Metallica song\u2026. and again\u2026. and then finally, a riff that isn\u2019t a Metallica song, but is in fact, a Motley Crue song, with the intro riff stolen from Megadeth\u2019s Skin O\u2019 My Teeth. This 80\u2019s glam metal track has some of the worst lyrics of all time in it. I swear to god.\n\nSo, after that obscene amount of plagiarism finished, I paused the album and thought. \u201cIs there any point in continuing? So far it's nothing but rip-off after rip-off\u201d... But I did. On the off chance something original turned up, so the only original song on the album is track nine, which is in fact a remix of their song \u201cDying in Your Arms\u201d with a new title (or at least, that\u2019s what I\u2019m assuming). So, more and more plagiarism, and wow, does it continue. And then, all of a sudden, something heavy, something odd, and something all too familiar shows up. A cover of Nevermore\u2019s \u201cEnemies Of Reality\u201d shows up. Wow, never thought I\u2019d hear Trivium covering that. Oh look, a new title... (For those too dense to get the sarcasm, it\u2019s not a cover, just the exact same fucking song with new lyrics basically). So, that\u2019s \u201cThe Crusade\u201d in a nutshell. Everyone else\u2019s masterpieces, with Trivium\u2019s shite lyrics. Here\u2019s hoping they go back and listen to Ascendancy to see what they did right.\n\nThe 20% I\u2019m giving this album is simply for the musicianship. They can obviously play, even if they are now a cover band. And that brings us to another premise: one of the main concerns in heavy metal is the future of this music, the renewal of the greats. Perhaps the recurring question is which group is going to assure you a massive concert when Maiden, Judas, Metallica, AC/DC retire. People actually say that Machine Head or Slipknot haven't been embraced enough to take the throne either, so Trivium is the ideal candidate to fill that gap. That's so wrong. I wouldn't have any problem with that if not for the lot of material traced from already known bands (I guess I'm not the only one who has this vision). Trivium decided to go the wrong way on their third album, but they managed to refine their proposal better on the following releases. Yes, they can continue in the laughable race to occupy the metallic throne if they want, but thank God this wasn't the end.\n",
        "\nAside from 2008\u2019s Shogun, I must admit that Trivium\u2019s discography has always felt rather spotty. That album lived up to the potential and greatly expanded the scope set up by the band\u2019s endearingly flawed early work. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by 2011\u2019s In Waves at the time and the subsequent efforts ranged from good concepts with flat executions, blandly serviceable ventures, and identity crises that considered the advice of people who probably never should\u2019ve been listened to in the first place.\n\nThat brings us to Trivium\u2019s tenth full-length album, In The Court of the Dragon. Coming out just a year after 2020\u2019s What the Dead Men Say is enough to raise an eyebrow but the prospect of venturing back to Shogun\u2019s epic brand of thrashy metalcore makes for even greater intrigue. While it\u2019s more realistic to view this album as a composite of that sound with supplementary cues from the band\u2019s other eras, it\u2019s far from the rushed conundrum that it could\u2019ve been.\n\nTrivium has maintained stellar musicianship over the course of their career, but I don\u2019t think their playing has sounded this powerful since 2005\u2019s Ascendancy. This is especially apparent with the guitars, which utilize the thick fiery crunch that I always loved about their earliest efforts and minimize the muddier aspects. On top of that, it\u2019s hard to remember the last time that the drumming was this brutal and the vocals reflect a greater sense of maturity and conviction in both their cleans and screams.\n\nThese elements along with the return to a mythological aesthetic result in some of their most inspired songwriting in years. One can detect some prog metal influence in the borderline Nevermore-esque hooks on \u201cLike a Sword Over Damocles\u201d along with the brooding on \u201cThe Shadow of the Abbatoir\u201d and the closing triumph of \u201cThe Phalanx.\u201d There\u2019s even room for some throwbacks as \u201cA Crisis of Revelation\u201d feels like a better revisit of \u201cAscendancy\u201d and \u201cFeast of Fire\u201d makes for some solid radio rock.\n\nAt the risk of hyperbole, In the Court of the Dragon is easily the best Trivium album since Shogun and quite possibly their strongest to date. Its quality is commendable considering the circumstances, released on such a quick turnaround this far into the band\u2019s career. Revisiting the band\u2019s later albums has made me realize that some of them were better than I previously thought, but I still find myself wishing they had come with this degree of power. It\u2019s amazing how much things can change in a year\u2026\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cLike a Sword Over Damocles\u201d\n\u201cA Crisis of Revelation\u201d\n\u201cThe Shadow of the Abbatoir\u201d\n\u201cNo Way Back Just Through\u201d\n\u201cFrom Dawn to Decadence\u201d\n",
        "\nLooking back to my days of highschool, it\u2019s fun to reminisce on albums that came out around that time that had some sort of hype, but lost it over the years. Sometimes, that\u2019s due to not aging well, other times it just gets lost in the depths of everything going on. Trivium\u2019s album In Waves comes to mind, considering that it\u2019s one that seldom gets talked about (positive or negative) compared to the likes of Shogun or Ascendancy these days. This disc turns ten later on this year, and I still to this day view it as a masterpiece, which may be a bit of a hot take.\n\nFor starters, I want to say that this is metalcore done exactly right. By this point, most metalcore bands abandoned the genre\u2019s roots, and traded in thrashy riffs and hardcore aesthetic for endless chugs, overly produced vocals, and extremely generic songwriting. Trivium never got caught up in that undertow. In Waves is absolutely packed with furious thrash riffs that cast sharp hooks, and evenly work in the hardcore chugs without being overwhelming. If that isn\u2019t enough, the actual songs have more advanced writing than ever. The Crusade may be a more direct thrash release, but this is where Matt Heafy and co. blended it wonderfully with hardcore to pump out a spectacular album.\n\nI want to fixate on the title track for a hot second. First of all, the way that its intro \u201cCapsizing The Sea\u201d works its way in and then winds up being the tail of \u201cIn Waves\u201d is some pretty top-tier writing, for how smooth it flows. I also say this because of the one-chord chugging managing to work so well for a tactic that I usually dislike. The drum fill that carries that into the chorus, the beautifully clean vocal execution, and a memorable lick to do this over is as top tier as this band has ever gotten.\n\nMore importantly, this tactic is spread all across the entire disc. \u201cA Skyline\u2019s Severance\u201d dips into some extreme metal vocal styles, and its smooth weave from beatdowns into a chaotic chorus is beefy as fuck. \u201cInception Of The End\u201d even slips blast beats into that formula, potentially being the most abrasive track to be had. You can get older Trivium vibes in \u201cBuilt To Fall\u201d with its steadier construction, yet the mean demeanor never slips away in the slightest. \n\nThe thrashier, and perhaps more accessible tracks are as present as they\u2019ve ever been; you just have to look below the surface, such as one \u201cForsake Not The Dream.\u201d \u201cWatch The World Burn\u201d is one of the most memorable songs the band has ever done. The riffs punch hard, and the chorus is written wonderfully. Another one that comes to mind is \u201cBlack,\u201d switching gears by injecting the explosive angle into the chorus. There are very few calmer, sad moments, but even those shine bright. The glaring example is the hopeless aura around \u201cOf All These Yesterdays.\u201d There are also some hints of this in \u201cCaustic Are The Ties That Bind,\u201d especially in the clean bridge that slowly grows momentum.\n\nMany years ago, I thought In Waves was a perfect album. Surely that was just a sign of the times, right? Coming back to it, I can see that my opinion has hardly changed at all. Why this is such a hot take these days, I\u2019ll never know. The soloing is strong, the writing is advanced, the thrashy parts hit hard and the hardcore parts threaten with force. Perhaps it's worth a revisit to those that weren\u2019t as fond of it prior?\n\nOriginally written for Sleeping Village\n",
        "\nBack-drawing contemporary genre. Appeal to the masses. Low level of musical and artistic prowess, or any inherent worth at all. Music that will inevitably sound lame after at most a decade. You know what I'm talking about; I'm talking about metalcore. Trivium's magnum opus \"Shogun\" (very unfortunately) belongs to this, er, \"bad,\" genre, specifically of the \"melodic metalcore\" creed. With how good the underlying material is, though, one would ask, what went wrong? Why did they go that route? The answer to that would probably be \"commercial concern.\" Metalcore was the big thing back then. Right? As much as everyone would want artists to only consider musical aptitude when elegantly crafting their work, people have families to feed. Alas, \"selling out\" creeps up on promising musicians, it usually doesn't happen willingly. And as for Trivium, their entire career was a big \"selling out\" to contemporary trends. But you can tell these guys are thrashers at heart.\n\nTrivium's earlier material that lied under the fa\u00e7ade of \"metalcore with a thrash twist\" was obscured by crummy production, lack of vision for how to accomplish in putting the two genres together, and metalcore being more dominant overall, allowing for fewer \"epic\" parts that make Shogun, Shogun. While this album isn't free from the aforementioned flaws either, it's a massive improvement, in contrast to their earlier works. And perhaps coincidentally, this is also the best music Trivium ever wrote to date. While most songs are plagued by cheesy, lousy parts just like their earlier work, the good parts ultimately drown out the bad ones. Conclusively, you're left with epic thrash metal delivered erroneously as metalcore; and mouth-watering virtuoso solos to top it all.\n\nAs soon as \"Kirisute Gomen\" kicks off after that cool acoustic intro, your expectations for the music are set very high. It's head-lopping, string-chugging, lung compressing, epic thrash metal (except for the chorus) with an amazing interlude. All the instruments are handled as they should be. The guitar work is as I've mentioned, epic, and the seven-string tones are also surprisingly chic and defined. Matt's voice is as good as ever, and his clean singing is more prevalent, not leaving much room for those, to put it mildly, \"odd\" rough vocals. The underlying drums and bass also do their work perfectly, though they aren't as coherent with the leading instruments as one would expect from a band that's so technically skilled.\n\nI wish I could write \"that's it, this defines the rest of the album well enough. Have a nice day, everyone!\" and call it a day, and give this a 100% rating, but oh, the throes of dealing with metalcore.\n\nThe rest of the album is dissimilar to the opening track. Alas, it's mostly (excellent) metalcore with virtuoso solos and thrashy interludes that make the tracks, with a few stand-outs. The material underlying those all had the potential to be just as good as Kirisute Gomen, but Trivium settled not to make such a massive change all of a sudden and core their metal instead. \"Torn Between Scylla And Charybdis\" and \"Throes Of Perdition\" are surprisingly not all that bland, but fall flat in conveying whatever emotion or musical worth they're supposed to express. Other than those two, though, it's some fun little metalcore that you can't even tell apart from each other, and probably won't listen to again. Until the title track begins rolling, that being.\n\nThe song \"Shogun,\" much like its companion track \"Kirisute Gomen,\" is pure metal almost entirely devoid of that \"-core\" stuff, with progressive elements and enough variation between different segments that keep you engaged for 11 minutes. Just listen to it, you won't be disappointed.\n\nMy reaction to Shogun once it ended was listening to it again a couple of times. After that, a couple more. Then sadness and a bit of anger, as I noticed how much potential was essentially wasted here. Damn it, Matt.\n\nNowadays, Trivium are well past their prime. Looking at their recent releases, it's a good possibility they'll release a pure thrash record one day, but they should've done that with Shogun. It's so sad to see such an inherently good album fall victim to the faintness of a genre dead on the water.\n\nConfused reader's guide to the album:\nMust-listen: Kirisute Gomen, Shogun.\nGood stuff: Throes Of Perdition, Torn Between Scylla And Charybdis.\nNot recommended or otherwise unnotable: Tracks not yet mentioned.\n",
        "\nFollowing Trivium's surprise comeback in 2017 with their album The Sin and the Sentence, hopes were high leading into 2020 in which the first single from their upcoming album What The Dead Men Say was revealed. That single was named Catastrophist and, not unlike the title track of the albums predecessor, was a track that packed every style you could expect to see in the upcoming album into a single song. It was a strong opener that served to demonstrate the direction Trivium had chosen for the upcoming record.\n\nIn essence, What The Dead Men Say is more of the same. Thankfully, despite perhaps lacking the originality of The Sin and the Sentence, more of the same is a very good thing indeed. What you get is an album that continues on the path forged by it's predecessor, making general improvements in areas like the quality of the mix but generally keeping what worked entirely intact. In general, if you liked the last album, you can expect to like this as well. \n\nStylistically, What The Dead Men Say is very much a post-metalcore album packed to the gills with scream vocals, blast beats, rapid tempos and complex guitar riffs. As one would expect from the genre, the scream vocals share center stage with a good quantity of cleans. Matt Heafy's vocals are sounding the best they ever have - his scream sounds the same as ever, yet his clean vocals have improved in leaps and bounds over the last few albums. His voice, now deeper with age, carries a distinctive texture which is taken full advantage of in his exceptional performances. The guitar work here is also in incredibly fine form with copious amounts of dual-harmonies and layered riffs, performed with incredible precision. Paulo's bass is clearly audible in the mix, not only doing a fantastic job filling in the bottom end but also contributing to the music above and beyond that, frequently diverging from the guitar riffs and even on multiple occasions even taking the lead during certain sections of songs. And of course, a modern Trivium album review simply cannot fail to mention the drumming of Alex Bent. As a drummer, his contributions seem as though they'd be overdone and needlessly complex, yet despite their evident complexity they never feel out of place or unnecessary, not only serving their songs, but elevating those same songs. Something that was incredibly evident on The Sin and the Sentence is just how much Alex Bent's performance elevated the rest of the band, resulting in songwriting they'd never have attempted otherwise, brought to life by career-defining performances in the studio. \n\nIt's near impossible to overstate the quality of the performances the band has turned in here, performances only further strengthened by an exceptional mix that not only does the intensity of the music justice but all the while gives every instrument room to breathe. It is a digital mix characterized by the typical compression one would expect, but the result is easily the finest sounding album in Trivium's catalogue. \n\nAs for the quality of the selection of songs found here, What The Dead Men Says manages to be a more consistent album than it's predecessor. While it doesn't reach the lowest points like 'Heart from your Hate' (I feel alone in just how much I despise this song), it similarly fails to reach the highest points like 'Sever the Hand'. That's not to say it doesn't have it's fair share of excellent songs, a few particular stand out tracks being The Defiant, Bending The Arc To Fear and The Ones We Left behind. \n\nIn summary, What The Dead Men Say is a continuation of the previous albums style with small refinements and improved consistency. Is it better than The Sin and the Sentence? That's quite debatable - I personally don't think so, however it's very close. Regardless, both albums are without a doubt among Trivium's very best output and both come emphatically recommended.\n",
        "\n(Part III covers a band not listed on MA, check the link at the bottom to find the Atreyu review)\n\nI've recently learned about the theory that the kind of music you hate the most tends to actually be superficially similar to the kind you love the most. Your natural assumption would be that somebody's least favorite style of music is the one the most opposite to their favorite, but ask any outlaw country fan what they think of Florida Georgia Line, or any jazz fan what they think of Kenny G's schlock. Most pertinent to this series, ask any underground metalhead in 2005 what the worst genre was and they'd probably say metalcore. The idea is that this is due to a sort of \"musical uncanny valley\", where you hate what you hate the most because it's almost something you love, but something about it is just too off, too artificial, too wrong to truly be what it is you love, and that gives us a sort of fight-or-flight reaction of visceral disgust. I've been thinking about this a lot as I explore these metalcore bands for this series, and I think Trivium here is the poster child for metal's uncanny valley. I know I spend a lot of time harping on how metalloids are obsessed with aesthetics and reflexively reject bands that don't look the part, and I still think that's true to an extent, but this way of thinking has really helped me to understand why this entire scene got shat on by the underground for so long, and Trivium in particular got it real bad. They were an internet punching bag for years and I didn't even really question it. Of course they sucked, I mean come on, have you listened to them?\n\nI didn't start this series with the intention of pointing at maligned releases and just saying \"Thing Good, Actually\", but it was inevitable that it would happen at least once and I'm just as surprised as you are that Trivium wound up being the lucky winner.\n\nThe reason I think Trivium hit that musical uncanny valley more than any of their peers is because holy shit I never realized how 80s these songs are. Seriously! There are loads of things for classic metal fans to enjoy here, mostly in the absolute heaps of influence they took from Metallica and Iron Maiden. The Crusade is obviously their \"We're thrash now for real please respect us\" album, but Ascendancy is the one I remember being their breakthrough and the one that started all the backlash, and I can see why people had that reaction to it. Sure, there are tons of dueling solos and harmonized melodies and bona fide thrash riffs, but there is enough that's just left-of-center enough to feel inauthentic. Something simple is the fact that the album is played in Drop D tuning. For the non musicians, all you really need to know is that dropped tunings simply aren't the approach that most bands take if they're aiming for the sound Trivium was aiming for here. That's more the domain of grunge, nu metal, and, well, metalcore. It's very easy to get huge sounding powerchords that jump around the neck with that top string down a step and it's conducive to writing big fuckin' breakdowns and really fast chug riffs (both of which this album doesn't necessarily shy away from, in fairness). Hearing somebody take that tuning and basically rewrite \"Trapped Under Ice\" with it just feels different, and even if you don't know or understand all that, your brain picks up on it. The tuning isn't the be-all-end-all wrong part, but it's one element of several that divorces Ascendancy from its roots just enough to feel like some sort of forgery.\n\nBut honestly, it's not really an impostor because the music is surprisingly legit. That opening attack of \"Rain\" is absolutely devastating, \"Drowned and Torn Asunder\" is genuinely just thrash metal with a beefier low end, \"Declaration\" sounds like a squadron of machine guns, \"A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation\" has a main riff that sports an incredibly infectious hook and transitions into some of the most Maiden melodies that Maiden never wrote. Everywhere I look there's something else I enjoy. My memory told me this had very pedestrian drumming but it's actually mega energetic, and the solos are some of the best the genre ever produced. The sound is great, the songs generally smash (though of course the more melodic ballady songs like \"Departure\" and \"Dying in Your Arms\" are incredibly boring and throw a monkey wrench in the album's momentum), hell even the common problem of bands strictly adhering to pop song structures isn't as obvious or irritating this time, even though they pump out a lot of standard verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-solo-chorus songs regardless. There's enough variety in approach that it doesn't get nearly as tiring as it did with Killswitch. The cliches are still here of course, the choruses are almost uniformly cleanly sung and the most intense part of any given song is the first fifteen seconds, but it feels less dogmatic and more loose here.\n\nHowever there's an elephant in the room here. I haven't brought up the vocals yet, and that's because \"Beefy\" Matt Heafy has the absolute worst scream in the scene. His harsh vocals are unbearably inept, to the point where they genuinely hinder my enjoyment to a surprising degree. His cleans are fine, unremarkable but serviceable, but his harsh vocals are leagues below anybody else I've heard so far. They're very hoarse and scratchy, like somebody running their nails down drywall. He sounds like he was moderately thirsty but decided to track every single song in one long take before getting a glass of water. I like to imagine his clean voice is his only real voice, and the screams are just the result of something like that Finnish cough drop commercial where the black metal guy takes a lozenge and then starts singing like Pavarotti. That bit at the end of the second verse of \"Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr\" where he goes \"I'LL BURN YOUR WOLLL\" sounds drier than Ben Shapiro's wife. More than anything, Trivium needed to tell Heafy to just stick to guitar while they hired a real vocalist, because he's pretty good at guitar and unbelievably bad at vocals. I know Trivium is still releasing new albums to this day and I hope to god he's either improved or dropped them entirely to focus on clean singing, because god damn I can not stress enough how awful they are. Imagine starting a thrash band and then letting some kid who has never screamed before but was into Terror last summer handle the vocals, because that's not too far off from what we got here.\n\nIt's such a shame that the vocals are as bad as they are, because they're really the only element of the album that I actually think sucks. On an instrumental level Ascendancy sits somewhere in the high 70s/low 80s range; not great but it's consistently quite good. But those screams are so prominent and so bad that they seriously shave off like twenty fuckin' percent off the final score for me. Running classic non-extreme metal through a filter of modern melodeath that makes it both heavier and catchier should be easy as hell to do, but the vocal choices they made here just amount to a stake through the heart.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nObsequious favouritism in the music press aside, I\u2019ve always quite liked Trivium. From the beginning, Matt Heafy and Corey Beaulieu seemed like they had done their trad metal homework very thoroughly (Paolo Gregoletto too, but less noticeably), paying their dues if you will by incorporating the influence of NWOBHM and \u201880s thrash under the sheen of their modern metalcore-leaning sound. As someone who has problems appreciating most metalcore, I\u2019ve never minded the harsh/clean vocal switches or beatdowns that characterize many Trivium songs. Besides, the pair of guitarists have proven on numerous occasions that they have the chops and feel to spice up songs with twin leads and exhilarating solos, even when Heafy\u2019s dry roar becomes a little grating or the rhythms get bogged down in over-clipped production. On the other hand, Trivium haven\u2019t quite delivered the way certain magazines and channels were anticipating back in 2005, releasing a string of decent but unspectacular albums since the watershed moment of Ascendancy. Although it\u2019s grown on me by stages since first listening, The Sin and the Sentence tells a similar story of moderate success.\n\nCertainly, on my first few listens I was not a fan of the predominantly mid-paced and melodic material that spans almost an hour across 11 tracks. In part, that\u2019s because Trivium have been struggling to balance their mainstream aspirations with musical complexity, resulting in songs that may be structurally or technically complex but also attempt to include a few radio hooks. Far from the only example, \u2018Betrayer\u2019 emphasizes that most obviously, pairing an Amon Amarth or At the Gates main riff with lyric-led verses and a crooned chorus that has a pleasing momentum but would land smack onto any FM rock hour. As I find often happens with Trivium, \u2018Betrayer\u2019 feels musically satisfying yet atmospherically and emotionally wanting, chopping and changing sections too clinically to meld the song into an entire experience. I\u2019d point to another single, \u2018The Heart from Your Hate\u2019, as similar with its earworm chorus, though that tilts even further towards mainstream rock, as with \u2018Endless Night\u2019, which exhibits extremely melodic playing and Heafy dominating with clean vocals. On that score, the usual pristine sound makes sense, since the Floridians were clearly going for something hookier in those cuts.\n\nThe flipside to The Sin and the Sentence comes with the more metallic cuts. I\u2019m not going to say that I outright prefer these to the simpler songs, but it\u2019s a fact that I choose to listen to Trivium for a style that crosses metalcore with American melodeath, a touch of thrash, and some classic leads. The title track and \u2018Sever the Hand\u2019 cater best to that niche, maintaining the anthemic use of cleans in slightly more aggressive choruses while also spinning off from their main musical features into detailed lead sections, which could be classified as sort of neo-Satan or Mercyful Fate workouts. More basic stadium-style leads add a nice touch to \u2018Beauty in the Sorrow\u2019 too, which shows the quartet haven\u2019t lost their touch for marching bridge riffs either. This all stems from a tendency that I've noticed since Shogun for the heavier material to be more varied and less direct, meaning that fewer riffs and bold verses hit directly. Yes, we get 'The Wretchedness Inside' with a straightforward grooving riff and verse/chorus structure, though that branches off into Disturbed-esque vocals, a metalcore beatdown, and a classic melodic lead. Indeed, one of the reasons why I enjoy modern bands like Trivium is down to their knack for pulling in different styles, yet The Sin and the Sentence occasionally feels a bit much.\n\nMy lasting feeling about Trivium's seventh album (I know, right? How did we get here?) also revolves around the cohesion of the experience. Barring the superior and well-balanced title track, the front half of the album displays greater tendencies towards melodicism and hooks, while the latter half features more outright metal material, all a little confused and mixed in different quantities. That leaves the album without a particular flow from beginning to end. I'm not totally convinced by all of the cuts either, which grows more noticeable on a lengthy album, where 'The Revanchist' and 'The Wretchedness Inside' could certainly stand to be shortened. Then again, nothing actually horrid occurs at any point, thus explaining my ambivalent forgetfulness of The Sin and the Sentence for the last year or two. I definitely feel as if Trivium still have some great songs left in them, but I'm not sure the band are making music for people like me right now.\n",
        "\nRemember the Sin and the Sentence? That album was the reincarnation of Trivium for me! They have released their second perfect album (the first one being Shogun) and have put everything they've got into that album. So after that they had exactly three options: go on, change the direction a second time, or build on their success and the quality of that album and try to improve what isn't improvable that much anymore.\n\nSadly, they have chosen the first option: this album is to me like a b-side of the Sin and the Sentence album. Trivium has started with an prelude to this album that directly goes into the title track. That was the part that made me excited like a child at first. Also the first part totally baffled me. The chorus was great. But then it was totally disappointing, because after that nothing new happened anymore. This song is long, nothing more. It's like the inverted version of In Waves, this time mainly clear singing with the same 4 verses over and over again and a low part of screams. The riff was interesting in the beginnig, but is really not that great to play it through the whole time.\n\nAfter the Catastrophist I've noticed that this time Trivium have tried to keep the main elements of the Sin and the Sentence, kick out everything that would have costed too much effort and time to think through, and trimmed everything to catchy songs. It's OK to get into the band, but you cannot really enjoy this album, if you already know older albums, especially its predecessor and Ascendancy, where they have tried to surprise you repeatedly.\n\nBesides the simple structures of the songs, you have sometimes even serious flaws of boredom here. Amongst the Shadows and the stones follows the same concept in songwriting as the title track. They have thought about a main riff and have started an at least aggressive passage, but it's filled with breaks and switches between the harder parts and parts that intend to sound dramatic, but simply end up flat in these almost 6 minutes duration.\n\nThe hommage to The Deceived, called The Defiant, really sounds great and makes you feel like back in the Ascendancy times. The best song on this album is Bending the Arc to Fear, which is at least one song that comes in the quality of the songs on the Sin and the Sentence. All together with Catastrophist you have three outstanding and great songs here that will make you listen to them over and over again, while you will lose the interest of the other songs after a couple of listens already. At least, with Scattering the Ashes, they have managed to release one good rocker again. Since Silence in the Snow, Trivium have perfected it to write melodic songs without screams or fast tempo, and it's guaranteed that whenever they write one of these, they nail it.\n\nThe songs on this album aren't that bad, especially their catchiness make you listen to and enjoy them the first times. However, on album length you will quickly lose interest to the most songs. The positive side of this album is that they haven't done the same mistake as on In Waves. So to me personally, it's at least better that they have sticked with something that we are known from them already than ruining it with going into a totally different direction and messing it up like on that horrible letdown from Shogun to In Waves.\n",
        "\nOK, this was like a deja v\u00fa to me. I've followed Trivium since 2008, the first album I've listened to was The Crusade. I've known some of their earlier stuff like the Ember to Inferno track and some singles from Ascendancy, and back in my metalcore times, this was the shit for me. Then they were about to release Shogun and I had that feeling that they will simply mix the styles of Ascendancy and The Crusade and in the end this was exactly, what they have done on Shogun.\n\nAfter that album they have totally stepped into a different direction, went softer but also experimented with other styles, like a pure metalcore album (In Waves), alternative metal (Vengeance Falls) and 80s heavy/power metal (Silence in the Snow). Back in 2015 I have already had that feeling that they will pull off another trick like in 2008, and when the title track of this album came out, I was so blown away, it was to me beyond excitement. I couldn't wait for the release of this album, and even after 3 years I still cannot say anything than that it's purely majestic!\n\nSo remember a band that always went into one direction, with each song, hasn't prepared any surprises since Shogun? Trivium start this album with a power metal song. No shit! If Matt wouldn't scream in the background in some passages, you would have almost a hommage to Hammerfall. As if this epic intro riff wouldn't be enough, you are greeted with machine gun drummer Alex Bent. This totally unimposing dude was practicing his skills on bands like Rings of Saturn and Brain Drill. You know, these bands, who exaggerate on their instruments as if they had a cocaine overdose? Yes, this guy is on the drums now, and even if he hasn't the vibe of their first drummer Travis Smith, he is technically the best drummer they've ever had. But no, Trivium don't simply stop at this, they go on, on the same track, after the main part, with a nice guitar play and then totally escalate in the end, kinda as a preparation for the second song on this album, Beyond Oblivion. It's the heaviest and most brutal song on this album and the way they have improved their technical skills over the years and combine them with their songwriting skills, they have simply create something flawless.\n\nAfter the first two great song, Trivium really don't save on some softer songs. I can clearly imagine, how they have tried to make this album perfect. They have tried to write songs on this album so that everyone has something to pick. Other Worlds and The Heart from your Hate are actually just generic hard rock songs. The second one is clearly the most generic one of this album, while Other Worlds has more emotions on it. However, because of these two songs and Endless Night, there are a bit too many weak songs on it. I could have accepted it, if they had only kept Other Worlds on this album, since it has the best lyrics from these three, but the other two weren't necessary.\n\nThere is one other aspect that I've forgotten and that I have remembered from the Shogun album: back then they have perfected that album by adding some prog elements to it and simply have played something crazy and interesting in these songs (just remember Between Scylla and Charybdis, or the Shogun title track). On The Sin and the Sentence they have done the same. What you could already hear in the last minutes of the title track, you can find on songs like Sever the Hand and the Revanchist. Sever the Hand starts with a sick riff, and over the time you have some breaks with cheerings and other really great passages. The Revanchist is the best song to me on this album. It's 7 minutes with the best aspects of post-Shogun Trivium.\n\nSo here we have it folks, the reincarnation of Trivium! This album is the epitome of modern metal perfection! I can hear out the blood, sweat and tears and all the passion this band had when they have written the album. I have thought a long time that Matt Heafy is the mastermind behind the albums and just decides alone what has to be done and what not. But I have heard that the band, at least the main members (so never the drummer) write many songs together and put personal issues and feelings in them. This is of course one of the most important things when you want to write authentic and superb music.\n",
        "\nI remember back in 2011, when I have heard the single Shattering the Skies Above for the first time. Before that, I haven't listened to Trivium for a long time, since I was busy in listening to other music genres and other bands. However, that I could remember about the predecessor was just a flawless modern metal album, which was to one of the best albums that I have ever listened to. So when I have listened to the single, I was first totally blown away, but with every minute that passed I was more and more disappointed, because this had nothing to do with the almost perfect music Trivium has released on Shogun. I was a bit relieved, when I've read that this single was only one song for a compilation, and won't be on the final release of the upcoming album. So my expectations to this album didn't change. And thinking that they might release another great album was simply the biggest misconception I've ever had.\n\nNo, this is not the Trivium that I have known and started to love! I don't know, what the fuck they have thought, when they wrote this album. Maybe they were just tired of the bullshit elitists spew at them after all that effort they have put in the Shogun album (read the reviews here, people unironically found reasons to totally hate this album). Maybe they just thought \"you know what? Fuck it, we can play as good as we want, we won't be accepted by the metal community anyway!\" Dumped all ideas they had for the actual successor, Heafy and Paolo shove their heads as a sign of denial, kicked out their drummer, because he was too good and devolved to edgy teens again. Otherwise tell me, how can a band that has written songs with nearly everything that was ever made in 80s - 00s metal, just stop caring about it?\n\nI guess they have noticed that it's easier to write an album for making fast money. So they have simply stopped with that all. No fast plays, no sick solos, no tempo switches, no extraordinary passages, simply nothing, where you feel proud of being part of a generation that tries something new, something special, that proves that the bands of your generation and the recent trendy music style are capable of writing good music and also have actual talent. No, instead they have stopped with all that. And do you what's the worst about it? It works! The band even got more reputation with this horrible excuse of an album!\n\nRemember back then on Ascendancy, when Rain started after End of Everything? Yes, it was a thrashy piece with lots of energy and Matt screamed his guts out, followed by a great chorus. It was fast, extreme, but still concise. What does In Waves begin with? After the really interesting and sinister intro Capsizing the Sea, the title song follows up - and it's by far the most boring song that I have ever heard. Even a generic metalcore band can write a better intro than Trivium. The only thing you hear a dozen of times is - surprise - \"IIIIN WAAAAAAVES\" on a total dull riff and cheap grove, before Matt starts singing the chorus like a 12 year old. Yes, that's the whole song. Don't expect anything interesting to happen in 5 minutes! Even the guitar solo is totally uninteresting.\n\nInception of the End is a bit better, but seriously, who the cares, if this song is better than the worst song in the history of this band? The whole time I have listened to this album I have waited for at least ANY unexpected passage, interesting riff, great guitar solo. But instead what do we get on this album? Radio rock! Yes, exactly this! This album has so many totally bland, generic and unworthy radio rock songs, if you would sit in your car, turn on your local FM and be right into one of these songs, you would not notice AT ALL that it's Trivium. You could confuse this with one of the many music industry cash cow bands there. The songs I'm referring to are Watch the World Burn, A Grey so Dark, Black and Built to Fall. Fine, you would hear out the background screams for Corey, in Watch the World burn and Built to Fall, but until that moment, you wouldn't even think a second about Trivium as a metal band.\n\nOK, I shouldn't just bash this album to the ground, there are also some better songs on this album. For example, if you have survived that pure boredom of Inception of the End and the In Waves ripoff Dusk Dismantled, with 20% more words in it that the other said song, skipped the two radio rock songs Watch the World burn and Black (congrats, we're already halfway through), you will get to song no. 7 - A Skyline's Severance. And what can I say, the first time the band makes everything right. Maybe not Shogun right, but at least Ascendancy right. It is basically a melodic death song with groovier parts, so nothing new, but so much better and hearable than the dull stuff I had to endure so far.\n\nThe album even gets worse than it was before and you get two totally ridiculous songs here: Caustic are the Ties that bind and Forsake not the Dream. Still think, they offer you something worthy on 5 minutes long songs? Guess again, you won't get anything here. Both open up with a melodic intro, followed up by screams, a chorus with cheesy signing and that was it basically. If you haven't the special edition of this album, you won't get into the taste of the second good song here called Drowning in Slow Motion. OK, sure, the concept is the same, heavy parts followed up by a melodic chorus with clear vocals, but this time it has good guitar works, persistent drumming and it's an overall despaired songs. This is another song that at can reach at least Ascendancy level. It's really sad that a band that evolved over all the years has started to fall behind their early years. But I guess that's the price you pay, if you want to make money.\n\nIn case you have been one of the unlucky ones, and didn't come to the taste of the bonus tracks, our journey basically ends here, because there is nothing special to find here anymore. Chaos Reigns has one of the cheapest songwritings on this album, which doesn't mean anything on the other hand, since the whole album was cheaply written. But here we have even duller songwriting, because neither the guitar solo, nor the chorus, nor anything here can be distinguished from the rest of the song. The lyrics? Remember In Waves? Just replaces these 2 words with \"Chaos Reigns\" over and over again. It is as if they didn't even try to write good songs this time and just jammed until they have recorded enough songs to fill a whole CD with it. So I assume that after this song Trivium were so bored already, that there wasn't anything to do anymore, and they have just pulled out the cheapest escape from an album ever imaginable. Fine, just play the half-ballad and then come up with an outro, where you just strangle the guitar and add some inaudible mumbling in the background.\n\nThe lyrics aren't that much better either. Most of the lyrics are about despair, frustration, well, edgy teen stuff. Built to Fall and Watch the World burn however have one of the best on this album. You can really dive into the negative emotions when listening to the lyrics of Built to Fall, whereas Watch the World burn just breaks with the tradition of edginess and pseudo brutality and simply comes up with a positive message again. This hasn't been the first time it happened, they have already written songs like these en masse on Ascendancy, so I'm glad that at least a bit on this album is acceptable, but even that can't save it from being a total failure.\n\nIn the end I was not totally right either, since Shattering the Skies Above was presented on this album as well, even if only of the Special Edition. Considering this, it was even one of the best songs on this album with its whipping drums energetic melodic death riffs and Heafy's so far strongest screams I have ever heard.\n\nEven after years I am not able to fully enjoy this album, at least not, when I decide to listen to Trivium. This album is OK, if you mix the songs with other songs in a playlist, so you don't need to focus on any of these songs and do other stuff in the meanwhile. Over all, this is the worst album I have ever heard from Trivium, Not only it falls way behind its predecessor, it also falls behind the first two albums of Trivium, which is quite a thing to accomplish.\n",
        "\nFinally, taking more time to come up with a better, lengthy enough and quality record, having ten tracks and backed by supporting their latest record, What the Dead Men Say is another record by a more known band released in the midst of the Coronavirus, and support was only, well, supported by Matt through his ever-growing Twitch channel. Considering touring halted, I\u2019m sure this unsupported live release has excited many fans out there.\n\nWhat the Dead Men Say offers a lot of melodic metalcore, but enriched than ever before in a Trivium record. You might as say it\u2019s a metalcore record like the rest of them. Just by listening to Catastrophist and The Defiant as prime examples, the melodic essence in the metalcore sound is pure. This includes Corey\u2019s screaming, which I argue he\u2019s beaten his past performances. Same goes with Matt on both vocal variations used in the band. As for the guitars, they couldn\u2019t sound any better. The band worked well on the mix for balanced and clear sound, strengthening the rhythms and the melodies. They also greatly utilized the seven-string guitar, and it\u2019s probably my favorite writing from the band. When it comes to the drums, they\u2019re not as extreme as they were on the previous record. There are a handful of blast beats, but not exactly consistent. The drums sound more simple, but not bad. And for the most part, the bass hasn\u2019t changed, but for the melodic parts, the bass has a stronger tone.\n\nLike the previous record, What the Dead Men Say is another masterpiece unfortunately affected by some pretty\u00a0terrible songs. Amongst the Shadows & the Stones, it carries from the same performance as some songs from the previous record. The focus is more on the instruments and the vocals are a bit\u00a0overproduced with bad deliverance, the end result being repetitive. The same applies to Sickness unto You. Unlike Bleed into Me, Scattering the Ashes is a bad ballad. Its only impressive part is during the guitar solo. The acoustic versions of the aforementioned songs are also standard. I think Matt just picked the guitar, sang, and that\u2019s it.\n\nWith songs like Catastrophist, The Defiant, and my favorite of the bunch The Ones We Leave Behind, I think Trivium decided to participate in the metalcore sound often. The last time it felt like that\u00a0was in their debut album Ember to Inferno. Although it could use a little consistency and some tweaking, I liked the majority of the songs and I hope it\u2019s something the band will maintain\u00a0in the future. The best songs are the title track, Catastrophist, The Defiant, and The Ones We Leave Behind.\n",
        "\nThis is the third and last single in a row within three months Trivium released in 2019. Most of you hardcore punk fans probably know Dead Kennedys. I\u2019m not surprised, in the slightest, that a metalcore band would cover a punk band. Anyhow... Trivium seem to be faithful to the artists they cover, and this one is no exception. It\u2019s not the best cover (probably the worst), but like the Type O Negative cover they recorded, this one could\u2019ve been worse, too.\n\nThis cover sounds catchier than the original. Most of all just fun when it comes to the vocals, but I\u2019d forget about them. Perhaps here Matt is too faithful, which is why I couldn\u2019t like the vocals here. The riffs are pretty standard, but the guitar solo was impressive and a little explosive. And the drums and bass were not bad - especially the bass tone, which is what I enjoyed listening to the most and glad the mix sounded right.\n",
        "\nWhile the song sounds like it belongs on The Sin and the Sentence, and this being the second song the band individually released out of nowhere, like the Type O Negative cover just the month before, it doesn\u2019t really belong on said record either. The song isn\u2019t so terrible by any means, but it doesn\u2019t have the same energy as almost the entirely of The Sin and the Sentence. It sounds like it belongs to Silence in the Snow.\n\nThe guitars and the vocals gave this hard rock type of song as an impression. The rhythms and the effect on the guitars were as unoriginal as most modern hard rock or heavy metal music can get, while the vocals simply sound like Matt wants to show his vocal delivery, as a vocalist. And for the drums and bass, they couldn\u2019t be more underwhelming. The drums sound as simple as hard rock drums can sound, instead of displaying them on an extreme level and the quality the band presented in their latest record. At least the choruses are catchy, to an otherwise decent but bland song.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve listened to enough Type O Negative covers, but I never thought a band like Trivium would cover one themselves; no less the song which introduced me to my favorite band 13 years ago. Of course, I Don\u2019t Wanna Be Me is one of Type O Negative\u2018s rock-ish songs, but still holds a candle for being great among their greater songs. Trivium achieved that in their cover; being faithful for the direction Type O Negative went and not plaguing it with their core sound.\n\nHowever, while Type O Negative\u2018s version is melancholic, with overwhelming guitar distortion which was the beauty of the song, Trivium\u2018s version tone it down, made their version sound simple. That\u2019s what I didn\u2019t like about this cover. It sounds like an average rock song, whereas the original offered more than that. Matt\u2019s vocals were off, the guitars sounded bland, and pretty much the key that made Type O Negative what they are; the distorted bass, is absent.\n",
        "\nTheir fourth and final record in their two-year pace of dropping records, The Sin and the Sentence gets filled with dark brown blanks, with each individual song showcasing a particular symbol. Might as well call it the brown album. Anyhow, this record might just be the successor to Shogun. And for the fourth time, the band introduces their new drummer Alex Bent, who has a respectful extreme metal resume for being 24 years old at the time...\n\nSince 2015 and parting ways with their last drummer, the band reportedly sought out for a significant change to their sound. While they\u2019ve been experimenting for a few years, their modern sound has never seen a solid feedback, which is where this record comes in. With Alex joining the band, this demanded the band to change. Alex comes from a respectable extreme metal background from multiple bands; spanning between death (particularly brutal/technical), thrash, and black metal. This required the band to go as heavy as they can, but the way they know best and they\u2019ve developed the tools for that. This arguably is the band\u2019s first mature record since Shogun. What\u2019s great about this masterpiece is its balance. The album is evenly long, meaning all the songs aren\u2019t too long or too short (subjectively, of course). And finally, the band aiming towards writing and recording quality music, which took them almost a decade to accomplish.\n\nSo what exactly this record forced the band to do: write even more challenging, melodic, and now technical guitar compositions. There\u2019s a certain priority of playing slow melodies that create some kind of atmosphere (one example is in Betrayer\u2018s verses). The overdrive effect from the guitars is also insane. The best part about the guitars is simply the work from Matt & Corey with their astonishing teamwork - including the co-vocal parts. As for the bass, Paolo also stepped up his game. It\u2019s not just how the bass tone sounds, but he plays a bit more technical than previous records. And again, with the introduction of Alex Bent and him reintroducing the blast beats and his great cymbals work showcases the technicality behind the music. The band might have hit jackpot with Alex.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a couple of weak songs from the album. While Endless Night\u2018s melodies are great and the bridge/guitar solo/s with the extra samples in the background are fantastic, it resonates something from the previous record. The vocals\u2019 execution was bad. Despite being a very heavy and fast song, Sever the Hand sounds a bit bland and seems to only showcase the technicality, yet missing a substantial delivery. Not that the length was an issue, but The Revanchist also showcased more of the instruments, especially the guitars, while the vocals felt like the band overproduced them. With the re-recorded version of Pillars of Serpent, it\u2019s very similar to its original version. The first part is repetitive, but the second part where the band tuned up a notch sounds menacing, yet still made the song unlikable.\n\nThe Sin and the Sentence is the kind of record where a band makes a huge comeback, and Trivium indeed made a huge comeback. Despite a few flaws in the vocals department and their overproduction and a bit more focus on the instruments than for the whole compositions in certain songs, the band delivered a masterpiece which I can\u2019t recommend enough. The best songs are Beyond Oblivion, Other Worlds, The Heart from Your Hate, Betrayer, and Thrown into the Fire.\n",
        "\nSilence in the Snow was my introduction to the band. Listening to the title track and When the World Goes Cold, the band moved to a slower, heavier, and melodic approach in their writing. Now prioritizing on the seven-string guitar and Matt calming things down with a cleaner voice, this white album is an experiment. With this record, they introduced the new, young and replacing drummer Mat Madiro, which to no surprise was his only record. I\u2019ve read somewhere that he was originally the drum technician, so Matt doesn\u2019t necessarily reveals a habit of disliking certain drummers. They amicably departed. Regardless, this record has a flawless production, and you can hear the refreshment in the music, departing from that drenched and uninspiring sound of Vengeance Falls.\n\nThis record mostly offers drums from the likes of their first drummer, not so exciting or mesmerizing guitars that mostly aim towards being catchy, and the vocals are pretty standard. Since fans of the band are already aware of the seven-string instrumentation, this one by far has the worst display. It\u2019s like a rock band utilizing seven strings when there\u2019s no point in doing so. The sole instrument that has seen an improvement is the bass. You can tell how its tone adds to the album\u2019s heavier sections. Overall, what you get from the band are the many melodies and their weak deliverance, and the predictability and repetitiveness from the likes of their previous record.\n\nThird time\u2019s the charm. Although the material is original and faithful to the band, to some extent, and the music has seen a slight of improvement, Shogun is yet to see a proper successor - even if it doesn\u2019t need one. Trivium hasn\u2019t produced something worthwhile. I wouldn\u2019t quite suggest it\u2019s a terrible record, but Silence in the Snow is bland, but also just not for me. It\u2019s not on par with any records from the last decade and surely doesn\u2019t bring any excitement. However, this is the kind of record that welcomes anyone who likes music from all different genres to try it out. While Trivium has become stale over the years, I know they\u2019ll find their energy to create something explosive and be a competitor to last decade\u2019s records. The best songs are the title track, The Ghost That\u2019s Haunting You, and Until the World Goes Cold.\n",
        "\nIn Vengeance is a testament to what I mentioned in my In Waves review, about how the band from that point on would not produce the best music, and the quality massively dropped with this record. While maintaining their moniker metalcore sound, the band teamed up with producer David Draiman - the face behind the sickness; the monkey screamer; Disturbed. This will be a mini Disturbed review because apparently the production and the music feels like it\u2019s another Distributed record. These are the key factors on how this record is like Disturbed never went on hiatus, keeping the spirit alive but through other artists. The album cover is also out of place and doesn\u2019t fit Trivium\u2019s themes.\n\nI love Disturbed. I think they\u2019re one of the best nu-turned-alternative metal bands who\u2019re also aiming for a bit of heavy metal. They\u2019ve released some solid records consistently, but they\u2019re pretty overrated. There has been this long hiatus of Disturbed since 2011, but David hasn\u2019t quit altogether. Since 2013, as you can see here with Trivium, he kept himself busy. While producing his first record outside of Disturbed, he formed the short-lived industrial metal/rock band Device. With only a debut album, it was generic\u00a0at best. Not that I point my finger towards David, but I also noticed he was a guest vocalist in Megadeth\u2018s 2013 record Super Collider which was garbage. It\u2019s like David infects or shoves his taste into others\u2019 style of music, and therefore Vengeance Falls sounds like as if it\u2019s another Disturbed record.\n\nThat being said, Trivium sound like they\u2019re bored and didn\u2019t bring their fiery energy unveiled from the last decade. Matt sounds a hell of a lot different; as if he imitates David. Imitating James Hetfield was one thing, but trying to sound like David; with David\u2019s help, of course, is like crossing the line. It surely was David\u2019s idea since, again, this is like a Disturbed record. The rhythm, the melodies, and the guitar solos are the weakest in the band and quite\u00a0mediocre; just stained with what Disturbed would have sounded. At least the bass and the drums sound fresher - and I salute David for that. Otherwise, he\u2019s done a poor job as a producer and he and the band should\u2019ve written something original in the style of Trivium. Another flaw I noticed is how the songs are straight up repetitive and span for about four minutes until the last two songs, which are longer than five minutes. Even the bonus songs and the stupid covers aren\u2019t doing this record any justice. Apparently again, they\u2019re favoring quantity over quality.\n\nI found some hope in a song like No Way to Heal, which is my favorite song from the album that doesn\u2019t reek from a disturbed production.\u00a0Corey\u2019s screams sound different, but the guitars sound amazing. This includes Matt\u2019s melodies and the blazing pre-choruses melodies. Two more songs that I liked are the title track and At the End of This War. The title track was a Disturbed-esque song, but it has good delivery. The other song has explosive melodies. I\u2019m also happy that this is just a one-time cooperation and Trivium would return producing the music they know how to write best and not someone from outside to do it, especially someone who\u2019s pretty one-dimensional like David.\n",
        "\nThree years later and releasing yet another record which fans may consider a masterpiece, compared to Ascendancy and Shogun, but it\u2019s more of a return to the metalcore roots. Now tuned to drop C#, which highly identifies with the mainstream metal music, In Waves is the band\u2019s first commercial record; an all-in metalcore record in the band's style, of course. Which means the band strayed from their heavy and/or thrash metal sound and went a little more mainstream this time. The album is also similar to the sophomore album; long and kinda unorthodox record in the genre.\n\nFirst\u00a0of all, with the bonus tracks, the band highly favored quantity over quality here. With an extra interlude to the song Build to Fall, two extra songs titled Drowning in Slow Motion and A Grey So Dark and reintroducing the Shattering the Skies Above / Slave New World single, they happen to\u00a0rearrange the tracklist. This feels like either the band was rushing, even though three years seem plenty of time; albeit not a fair argument when you take touring and promotion of the predecessor record into account. Or, they simply\u00a0wanted to write shorter songs. It\u2019s like a video game with missing content. I will admit, though. I think this is the first record I\u2019ve seen an artist releasing [insert album version with bonus tracks] and rearranging [insert album version with bonus tracks] to match chronologically with the original version of a record that contains a closing track. Yeah - that was a bit mouthful, but my point still stands. The band favored quantity over quality.\n\nIntroducing the new but reportedly pain-in-the-ass drummer Nick Augusto. Originally debuting on said single, he introduces some blast beats for this record - which is something I always welcome. But for the main sound of the album, it\u2019s not as good as Ascendancy. The slight vocal change and range that Matt has now adapted to, with the introduction of the drop C# tuning, it needs time to mature; when the band have already matured. As for what metalcore overtly offers by its distinguish sound, In Waves is, again, not like Ascendancy. The music is mostly catchy and melodic, yet lacks the aggression whence heard in Ascendancy. I assume the band has also tried to achieve atmosphere for this record, as depicts within the album cover, but that didn\u2019t come alive with the songs.\n\nIf you listen to the fillers on the album, Capsizing the Sea is just an industrialized version of the title track with a piano sample. As the into progresses, you gain more electricity, but it\u2019s preferable to tune in to the song itself, as the intro repeats itself whilst building the atmosphere. Then there\u2019s the bonus track interlude Ensnare the Sun which has nothing to offer but some acoustic guitars and a bit of slow drumming and humming. Finally, Leaving This World Behind is a harsh and, again, industrialized music with Matt speaking in the background, giving a harsh speech. That\u2019s one example of the pointless fillers the band added for whatever reason.\n\nAs for the songs, as you\u2019ve already expected, there\u2019s the tradition of the band on how they vary between the melodic substance and the heavy substance of the music. Yet this variation is like a fluctuating chart. It makes for a pretty inconsistent listen. Just by listening to the title track, it\u2019s as if the band, or personally just Matt, haven\u2019t pushed themselves beyond their capabilities. As Matt screams the title of the track, it lacks a lot of aggression. Even Shogun had more aggression, and that\u2019s not exactly a metalcore record. Needless to say, the song is decent, with the choruses being the highlight. At least you have a song like Inception of the End, showcasing the blast beats, much more aggressive screaming from Corey, and overall fast riffage. Dusk Dismantled emphasize more on that. That song has even more aggressive screaming with a bit of death growls and fast tremolo picking. Then the album calms down a bit and leans towards the melodies with Watch the World Burns. That\u2019s pretty much In Waves for you.\n\nThe album has seen a decline with said interlude and the songs that span between Watch the World Burn and Caustic Are the Ties That Bind. While they\u2019re heavy and melodic, they\u2019re also underwhelming and failed to build any excitement. I think between them, A Skyline\u2019s Severance had a bit of potential, but not enough to capitalize on the first four songs of the album. Unfortunately, unlike Ascendancy and The Crusade; two albums which the band found a way to climb right back up after listening to a few consisted disappointing songs, In Waves failed to capitalize on that, too. After listening to the Demon Hunter-esque bonus song Drowning in Slow Motion, the band went down even worse with their repetitive heavy riffage and radio-quality material. Even their Sepultura cover of Slave New World was awful.\n\u00a0\nI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve doubted the band here, as I\u2019ve done so twice (on Ember to Inferno and The Crusade, respectively) and was wrong on both occasions, but In Waves and beyond may not be the best material the band wrote, let alone something to beat the likes of Ascendancy and Shogun. Overall, In Waves is a decent album but also a weak one. It\u2019s accessibility might\u2019ve overshadowed the band\u2019s approach and the quality of the music. Returning to roots isn\u2019t always bad, but it could\u2019ve been worse and most definitely could've been better. The best songs are Inception of the End, Watch the World Burn, Caustic Are the Ties That Bind, and Forsake Not the Dream.\n",
        "\nShogun might just be the band\u2019s opus magnum, where despite its quantity of songs, it displays a lot of the band\u2019s progressive approach in metalcore; from the departed sound of The Crusade. I had a debate over this record as well, whether the predecessor was the prime influence for Shogun to come up with the final product. However, I didn\u2019t see much of it. I think Shogun is the pinnacle of what Trivium is today. Every album from this point on is simply more refined, matured, excelled, and successful. The drums in the future may sound different, as Matt has gone on a streak with unsuccessful drummers until 2017, and this marks the last album with the original drummer Travis Smith. Never impressed me after all these years, so I guess it\u2019s not an enormous loss. Trivium left what you might identify as a stigma for hating a band labeled under a controversial genre among metal fans. Now they\u2019re truly not your average metalcore band.\n\nWith Shogun, I noticed the band prioritized more on consistent palm-muted riffs and many triplets, making the guitars sound more challenging than ever. Corey\u2019s screams are also back at their natural state, which makes it feel like this record came out right after Ascendancy. Matt also has his fair share of screaming, but he\u2019s also melodic with his clean vocals (and you might find him a bit harsh and aggressive in live performances for the songs from this record). Probably my favorite aspect of this record is the lyrical themes and the melodies. Most of the songs are very melodic, and as for the lyrical themes, I most definitely liked the unique titles. As for the bass (other than the bass solo in the second song) and drums, there aren\u2019t any detectable changes or improvements - especially for the drums.\n\nAs I mentioned the bass and drums, another major issue this record offers is its inconsistent pacing. There\u2019s a constant shift between the heavier songs to the melodic songs, instead of showing the record\u2019s progressive and challenging nature. This boils down to how in some songs the pacing sounds simple, like the band isn\u2019t trying. Insurrection and The Calamity are great examples, as they showcase the uninspiring melodies and anger, unlike how it was presented in the first portion of the album. Nevertheless, they aren\u2019t awful by any stretch, and when you listen to this record thoroughly, you\u2019re not really going to, let\u2019s say\u2026 disapprove of their existence. But what Trivium mainly tried to do, despite their metalcore background, is to record a masterpiece metal album in the caliber of Metallica, Iron Maiden (as suggested in the third and final bonus song of the same name which was identical and not offering anything new but pointless aggressive screaming) and more.\n\nWith that being said, I have to be biased and give Shogun a perfect score, despite the flaws I pointed out which rightfully should take out a few percentages. As this record offers melodies and heaviness, the best songs in these variations are Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis, Down from the Sky, Into the Mouth of Hell We March, Throes of Perdition, Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven, and the second bonus song Upon the Shores.\n",
        "\nA pretty\u00a0sick album cover to an otherwise unnecessary record. The Crusade seems to tone down the metalcore essence and rely heavily on the heavy/thrash metal elements the band incorporated into their music. Matt imitates James Hetfield, to the point this record feels like a Metallica tribute album of a sort. Of course, he does so to a certain extent. You hardly hear Corey\u2019s screams, too. This record also sounds quite\u00a0long and repetitive due to the songs\u2019 length, spanning between three to four minutes for twelve straight songs up until the long, closing instrumental title track.\n\nIgnition is a prominent example of the James Hetfield-inspired vocals, yet the song itself has great vibes; mainly from the guitars and drums. Revolved around thrash metal, it wasn\u2019t that bad. With the three and the final songs I mentioned below that suck, the album gets better, as it offers a bit of originality to this different direction the band shifted to. Some songs sound slower and heavy, while others are simply\u00a0groovy. You still have a few melodies throughout the album. The best of them being Tread the Floods, with its slow, intensely heavy riffs that send chills down your spine. The best song on the album, bar none! This, of course, includes the two bonus songs Broken One and Vengeance. I actually\u00a0wonder why these two b-sides to Anthem (We Are the Fire) didn\u2019t replace it for being the worst song on the album and maybe The Rising?\n\nDetonation varies between the heaviness and the softness of the band which made it hard to like\u00a0as a whole. The heaviness was intriguing, but when it comes to the choruses and how they soften the song, that\u2019s where it sounded cheap. With its auto-tune-ish melodic choirs, Entrance of the Conflagration brings in a lot of catchy heavy metal riffs that are\u00a0enjoyable to listen, but the execution was awful. This continues onto the bloated heavy metal song Anthem (We Are the Fire). The bass reminds me a lot of Iron Maiden which is an excellent thing, but another song affected by poor execution and unoriginal sound. This also introduces the very VERY retarded \u201cwhoa\u00a0whoa, whoa\u201d and the \u201cyeah-yeah, yeah\u201d in the bridge. That was unpleasant. With the album transitioning to a much more flowing and interesting sound after these three songs, it went back around again with The Rising, which was underwhelming.\n\nOverall, The Crusade is NOT - THAT - BAD, or almost not bad at all. I\u2019m definitely in the strong minority, though. While I agree with the average rating for this record here on Metallum and thinking it was unnecessary to release, I\u2019ve listened to way worse than this one. By saying unnecessary, the band released this record right after Ascendancy in just a year which may have an impact for the direction. They could\u2019ve worked on Shogun - their fourth record which is another arguable topic on whether that\u2019s their best release than release this one. Three years after Ascendancy is plenty of time to write a greater album. Alas, the majority of the songs are good, the rhythms being the most enjoyable aspect, and the concept as a whole including ideas behind the songs are noteworthy.\n\nI doubted the band with their debut album and had done so with The Crusade, but they keep proving me wrong and winning me over time and time again. Perhaps Trivium is just that good, having bold but successful directions, and Matt just being a great producer. The best songs are the songs from Unrepentant to Contempt Breeds Contamination (excluding To the Rats which isn\u2019t a bad song but not the best of the bunch) and the bonus song Broken One.\n",
        "\nAlready two years into their sophomore album, arguably the band\u2019s finest record to date and they were so damn confident picking the prefect title. The two new members of the band that would eventually become part of the band\u2019s legacy basically get treated as original members. Corey Beaulieu & Paolo Gregoletto helped Matt and the drummer Travis to refine the band\u2019s sound. With little experimentation, this incorporation offers more heavy metal style and a lot of melodies and stronger backing vocals to the more metalcore sound like the band displayed in the debut album. However, this is also not an entirely metalcore record, so keep that in mind.\n\nOpening the album with piano and choir melodies that ultimately end up in striking and catchy rhythms with Rain, that\u2019s already a start. You can hear Matt has vastly matured in his voice and sounds much better and innovative. The song also includes one of the better breakdowns/bridges in the genre, consisting with the heaviness of the breakdown and the melodies in the bridge. Then you have a song like Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr which focuses on simplicity but with sheer power and energy. There\u2019s also a song like The Deceived which is a tone down to the sound. That\u2019s what Ascendancy offers. Even the Master of Puppets cover, despite being half or full step down from the original, doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Sounds pretty faithful to the original when it comes to the instrumentation.\n\nAs solid as Ascendancy is, it has its cons. For example, A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation has dense execution. At one point it sounds old school, but at another point it sounds like the band was trying to show off instead of display their quality craft. The overblown melodies tend to sound like something you haven\u2019t listened to before and are merely pointless to begin with. The choruses and the clean singing also sound awful. Washing Away Me in the Ties, which is the second bonus song (I\u2019m not even sure that\u2019s how grammatically you\u2019re supposed to read the title) suffers from the same flaws, too. Like Light to the Flies isn\u2019t a terrible song, but the mix here compared to its demo version is bad. The demo version, in comparison, offered prettier vocal melodies and the raw and shredded riffs sounded much better. The version of Ascendancy sounds a bit typical for metalcore - maybe too typical. Then there\u2019s Dying in Your Arms; what would you call a ballad, or a radio song. The vocals reek, the main riff sounds lazy, and the approach is nonsensical, when the last six songs commonly shared one thing: heaviness. This song really came out of nowhere, and it\u2019s dreadful. In short, the three songs in the middle of the record had shown a decline, but rising right back up thanks to The Deceived.\n\nDespite of its metalcore essence, Ascendancy is on par with one of the best records in the genre, as well as back-to-back comparisons to the majority of the Massachusetts metalcore scene. The guitars\u2019 tuning/s and performance are excellent, not too shallow or unoriginal and overall having fast rhythms and melodies that offer fine tunes. The bass doesn\u2019t sound too bad, but it could\u2019ve been a little bit heavier, like in the debut album. The drums don\u2019t offer anything new other than the mix being better. And the co-vocals between Matt and Corey show the band\u2019s cooperation as musicians. Corey might as well be the better screamer in the band, but Matt offers that in some layers as well as his main clean and melodic vocals.\n\nAs a composer, producer, and writer, nearing 20, Matt matured so well in these departments that it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019ll disappoint. So like any other records out there that just sound promising by their titles alone, Ascendancy is one of them. This album should be recommended even for non-metalcore fans. The best songs are the first three songs, The Deceived, Declaration, and the bonus song Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies.\n",
        "\nLet me start by saying because the band didn\u2019t release their demo/compilation album Ab Initio separately, I\u2019m basically going to review that album and the debut album in a single review. I suppose there\u2019s a lot to write about, but that depends on the quality of the albums. As most of you may know, Trivium isn\u2019t your average metalcore band (not anymore at least), even with their debut album. For a metalcore album, the debut is long, and your singer at the time was pretty much a teenager, but for most teenagers, Matt\u2019s vocals were pretty decent.\n\nNot in a whiny way, but the melodic vocals sound like they\u2019re reaching for that range, though I\u2019m not completely annoyed by them. Another pointless and somewhat irritating aspect of the album is the first portion containing the songs stepping up a notch which alone makes these songs drastically worse (at least some of them). Slightly applies to the second portion, too. So let\u2019s get right to it. Starting with the irritating reversed intro, pointless interlude, and the decent outro, they have nothing significant to offer, except for the outro. As the intro is self-explanatory, the interlude is a dumb melody, sounding like the band is tuning their instruments. And for the outro, it\u2019s an acoustic instrumentation using the last song When All Light Dies\u2018s substance. It sounds a bit depressing by the excellent acoustic guitar chords and slow melodies, yet it\u2019s on repeat for like five to six times. Could\u2019ve sounded better, had they written more melodies to it. As for the songs, like I already mentioned the whiny melodies and the music stepping up a notch that ruins the composition, these songs range from the opening - and I guess a famous song of theirs - Pillar of Serpents to the title track (and one or two more songs in the end). The opening song in itself was not only disappointing and repetitive, but even its outstanding outro doesn\u2019t save the song from its sheer disappointing sound. Unlike other songs on the album, this song is the initial taste of what I mentioned by stepping up a notch. That\u2019s what made the outro fantastic. If only the song sounded and revolved around the outro\u2026 The song was re-recorded in 2017, so the least you can do is hope that maybe the new version might sound better, but I digress. As for the rest of the songs of said portion, while they sound very similar to each other, they\u2019re not entirely bad. The vocals (again, despite the whiny factor) and the instruments sound good, like how metalcore should sound. The second portion offers longer songs, resulting in a bit change of pace. Now, change is important, and this portion and its long songs show the change in the sound by not being so dull. However, it still sounds damn repetitive; the length within these long songs don\u2019t equal to a proper change.\n\nThe major problems this record possess are the unoriginal sound; heavily inspired by Killswitch Engage and All That Remains (the latter which released their debut album just the year before, mind you), no proper execution, poor songwriting, and not breaking the formula. Otherwise, all the instruments and vocals sound good. The mix sounds like how it should sound, which is why I mostly enjoyed the bass, but the drums, the guitars, the solos, and Matt\u2019s vocals were as decent as the band could produce. Now, Trivium has significantly improved over the years, there\u2019s no doubt about that. However, when it comes to their debut album, there\u2019s not much to look out for. It was easily dominated by their sophomore album Ascendancy and rendered this album somewhat of a weak record in their discography. Now, onto Ab Initio.\n\nThe next album in line, as I already stated, is the demo/compilation album which was added to Ember to Inferno when it was re-released. The first three songs are from the band\u2019s first demo Ruber (Red Demo 2001). The next seven songs are contained in the band\u2019s second self-titled demo (while officially released, though through the compilation album it\u2019s called Caeruleus (Blue Demo 2003). Flavus (Yellow Demo 2004) offers three demo versions for the band\u2019s sophomore album.\n\nRuber has underappreciated and masterful material. What might come as a shock to you the most, Matt was just 15 when the band recorded their actual first demo. Not sure why it wasn\u2019t brought to light from day one, but after 15 years, it\u2019s revealed. What\u2019s so distinctive about this material, compared to the rest of the tracks from this entire huge re-release, is the experiment and atmosphere. Vocally inspired by James Hetfield, as it\u2019s hugely evident in these three songs, Matt showed some power (even though he ruined his original voice over the years). I\u2019m also not sure if it\u2019s still considered metalcore, maybe hardcore in some kind, or heavy/thrash metal. Despite the raw production, the distorted guitars sound alright (but not as good as the chorus-effected melodies), the bass is heavy, and the drums are decent (though I suspect the band used a drum machine for the last song).\n\nCaeruleus overall doesn\u2019t sound any different than Ember to Inferno excluding the last three songs (The Storm, Sworn, and Demon). There isn\u2019t any significant difference in the mix between the demos and the debut album other than the debut sounding sharper with a heavier bass. As for the last three songs, I wonder why they didn\u2019t just end up in Ember to Inferno and have them replace the instrumental tracks. They clearly break the formula, which gives you a better impression for an otherwise repetitive record, though they\u2019re not the best songs and particularly fast when it comes to the drums. Demon might as well be the heaviest song the band recorded in that era, but man it went downhill after a powerful intro. Shame.\n\nFlavus simply sounds cleaner than what was produced in Ascendancy, and I enjoyed the versions of the songs on this demo than on said album (not that the songs on said album sound bad), even though they marginally sound different. Everything sounds great, from the mix to the instruments and vocals. There\u2019s more power to the demo versions. You can also tell that these songs balance between the aggressive approach to the lighter and melodic side of the genre, and I believe that\u2019s what granted the identity for the band which is something worth tuning to.\n\nFor perspective, I want to throw in my ratings for Ember to Inferno, the three demos as if they\u2019re individual releases, and Ab Initio as a whole. I\u2019m not going to compare either. Ember to Inferno was not the most pleasant album to listen. The fact that it\u2019s still lacking in necessary qualities to make a record worthwhile is blazed all over it. However, as I kept writing my review and listened to the album again and again, as well as comparing its songs to Ab Initio\u2018s, it started to grow on me on an acceptable matter. I\u2019m still of the opinion that it\u2019s an average debut album, and luckily for the band not being the worst in the genre, it\u2019s worth 75%. As for the three demos: Ruber\u2018s unique and unrealized material at the time is something worth checking out. It\u2019s not perfect by any means and not that mind-blowing, so I\u2019ll give it 60%. It\u2019s Caeruleus that made me like songs from the debut album I first didn\u2019t like at all. That\u2019s just for the demos. The last three songs, despite their formula-breaking sound, they were bad. Gonna give it 50%. Last but not least, Flavus gets 85% (don\u2019t think I need to explain this). FINALLY, the entirety of Ab Initio gets 30%; overall giving for this entire duo-release 70%. The best songs on the debut album are If I Could Collapse the Masses, Requiem (A Revelation), the title track, Falling to Grey, and My Hatred. With Ab Initio, the best songs are Pain and the entire Flavus demo.\n",
        "\nWhat The Dead Men Say is the ninth studio album from the american heavy metal band, Trivium. What The Dead Men Say was released through Roadrunner Records on April 24th 2020. Trivium is as follows, Matt Heafy (lead vocals, guitars), Corey Beaulieu (guitars, unclean backing vocals), Paolo Gregoletto (bass, clean backing vocals) as well as Alex Bent (drums). \n\nTrivium have also released four singles accompanying the albums release, Catastrophist, What The Dead Men Say, Amongst The Shadows And The Stones, and Bleed Into Me.\n\nWhat The Dead Men Say feels like a culmination of all the Trivium albums to date. It is as if the band managed to pluck parts of each album and inject it into this piece of work. And it pays off in the long end.\n\nStylistically What the Dead Men say falls under the traditional metacore sound, however, the band also includes elements from many other genres such as melodic death metal, black metal, and many others. \n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the bands previous album, The SIn And The Sentence, Triviums lyrical content is composed of certain aspects of modern day life. Trivium managed to bring themselves back to the forefront of the conversations about who is are the best metal bands in the business currently with The Sin And The Sentence, and What The Dead Men Say is going to make sure they stay near the front of that conversation. \n\nI wont delve into each track, however I would like to discuss the top two tracks in my opinion, that being The Defiant and the title track and single What The Dead Men Say. Each showcasing what I love about Trivium, The Defiant feels like old school Trivium blended with the modern songwriting of today, lyrically fantastic with a catchy chorus and beautiful unclean vocals. And as always with any Trivium song it is instrumentally perfect. Now for What The Dead Men Say, this album at first listen to me didn't feel like much, however after a few listens this song is one of my favourite tracks from the band. It has such a catchy chorus, even if it does feel a little repetitive. \n\nOverall this song is building on what The SIn And The Sentence laid down. It is a step in the right direction. Trivium are masters of their craft and it is quite clear if you're a fan of heavy metal or Trivium you will like this album. I would suggest purchasing this to any one I know.\n",
        "\nSure, the title may seem lucrative to some people, but then again I couldn't care any less. God of War: Blood & Metal is a six-track split from the game God of War 3 that features three metalcore bands (with other essences of their own): Killswitch Engage, Trivium, and Munity Within and three standard to progressive metal bands: Dream Theater, Taking Dawn, and Opeth. Additionally, although not available, there's a bonus track called Even Gods Cry by The Turtlenecks, which are just folk and their song is over seven minutes. Since that song and the band aren't available on this split, there's no point in mentioning them at all. First I'll talk about the metalcore songs and then I'll talk about the songs which others might like more, the traditional/progressive stuff.\n\nMy Obsession by Killswitch Engage is everything their self-retitled album from 2009 should've sounded. Not only this song specifically belongs to that album, yet it's too damn good that it was missed back then, and perhaps would've made said album better. Howard's screaming is unbelievably crushing, as well as his clean vocals. The guitars sound heavy and destructive with their pitched harmonics, not to mention them blazing melodies. With every passing second, the song sounds better and better. The bridge is atmospheric, which shows the band still had some originality. I guess this is truly a goodbye song from Howard or a departure-one last song with the band.\n\nShattering the Skies Above by Trivium was originally released on this very split album, though it was also released as a single with the band's cover of Sepultura's Slave New World and later as a bonus track on their fifth full-length, In Waves. Pretty impressed for a first impression, although I've had listened to two songs from Silence in the Snow that I liked, the music isn't that bad. It kinda varies between metalcore to the thrash metal essence. The blast beats are probably my favorite part about this song. And obviously, this is another pretty melodic band.\n\nThe End by Mutiny Within was surprisingly decent. This is one of those progressive metalcore bands that in this particular song feature some light symphonies to strengthen the atmosphere. While it sounds decent, it also sounds very mainstream; probably as mainstream as people might find this song on them shitty AMV (anime music video) YouTube videos. Averagely decent with some layers.\n\nRaw Dog by Dream Theater is a long, progressive instrumental track, and much like the song from Trivium this follows the same principle when it comes to its release date (though not available as a bonus track on any form). The song has a nice start, with its heavy - although quite djenty riffage, as the track progresses into a synthesized atmosphere. Though after that nice intro and progression, the track became more groovy and symphonic, which there I stopped caring. Then again, having to listen to a repetitive, seven-minute instrumental progressive track would be very annoying to go through and I'm glad I had to do this only once.\n\nThis Is Madness by Taking Dawn is standard metal song, although its guitars are very melodic with some power metal essence. It's got a fine guitar solo, but overall it's a generic metal song from a generic modern metal band. I honestly don't know what else to say other than being generic and also repetitive.\n\nThroat of Winter by Opeth, which is also available as a single in a vinyl form, is not that bad. The acoustic guitars sound amazing, while the song's progression becomes more synthesized and atmospheric. Pretty weird first impression since I'm a death metal fan and opted for something of that kind, but instead you get an acoustic song, which again wasn't that bad. At the same time, it doesn't belong here since I figured this split/EP was meant for whatever metal genre.\n\nNow for the ratings: My Obsession - magnificent! At a loss for words for this one. 100% Shattering the Skies Above will settle on 75%. I bet Trivium's music is great but, of course, to some extent. The End was, again, pretty mainstream and accessible. Didn't find anything original, but still an alright song. 60%. Raw Dog's best parts, which are unfortunately a repeat, are the intro and outro. 30%. This Is Madness makes me feel bad about modern metal music - but that song SUCKED. 0%. Throat of Winter, again, while it didn't belong to this album it was still not a bad song. 70%. Best songs are My Obsession, Shattering the Skies Above, and Throat of Winter.\n",
        "\nThroughout their career Trivium has often been compared to thrash metal legends Metallica. It's easy to see why people like to compare the two, as they both share a kind of similar musical progression and overall sound. You can place both bands' respective discographies side by side and compare how they treaded into new and similar phases. If 2011's In Waves, Trivium's fifth album, was the equivalent to Metallica's 1991 self-titled album, then this one is definitely the band's Load. The greatest difference, however, is that unlike Metallica's sixth album, Trivium's isn't quite the same kind of stinkin' pile of shit.\n\nWhere Metallica once was a great band during their early career, Trivium was more of a rocky road with some stink and some kill. Trivium actually managed to reverse that and become better and more progressive with age, to some degree, which is something every band should really opt to do. While they did make their great and so far untouched magnum opus in 2008's Shogun, the band did become a generally better unit with its subsequent albums. While they had hit their creative peak with Shogun and In Waves respectively, the band's next album would instead see them tone down on the many elements they had come to use by that time.\n\n2013's Vengeance Falls is a different record for the band, yet somewhat of a throwback towards their earlier albums. Gone are all of the instrumental preludes and longer mid-song passages that were present on the previous two albums. The band instead utilize a simple and classic song formula, under the guidance of Disturbed vocalist David Draiman, to many fans' disapproval. I'm not gonna lie; I wasn't exactly thrilled about his involvement either, but I must say that I was surprised by the end result. Despite some annoying vocal melodies during some parts, the songs themselves are actually very solid and not at all as \"minimalistic\" as Disturbed's music. There are, however, a few moments where the \"Disturbed formula\" makes itself apparent. This is most notable during the verses of \"Brave The Storm\", which is otherwise a great and catchy song, as well as in \"To Believe\"; the album's worst track. The bonus track \"As I Am Exploding\" is also a pretty nasty stinker which was rightfully rejected from the standard setlist.\n\nOn the upside of things, we've got an album here containing some of the band's best songs to date, such as the anthemic and extremely memorable \"Strife\". In Waves might have been a musically versatile and impressive album, but personally I didn't enjoy a whole lot of actual songs on it. Vengeance Falls instead puts its main focus on breeding strong tunes rather than showcasing the band's musical prowess. Songs like \"No Way To Heal\" perfectly showcases this; with a rather simple but powerful formula where the band perfectly mix tempo changes for a maximum song effect. Nothing more, nothing less. That seems to be the key here and I think it was the right choice for the band's longevity.\n\nTrivium is a very talented collective of musicians but due to this album's direction, we don't really get any particularly outstanding performances this time around. Everything sounds nice and tight but never that mindblowingly cool. There doesn't seem to really be any instrumental self-challenging going on here, apart from Matt Heafy's voice which is constantly growing and becoming more powerful. In a way, however, I don't necessarily see the need in it either, as they've already proven themselves time and time again how capable they are at playing.\n\nVengeance Falls is ultimately an album that has sadly met with tons of negative feedback since its release. Unlike some of the band's other material which seemed to mostly attract criticism from \"true metal\"-fans, this one really hit the spot when it got rejected by the actual fans as well. I do get that David Draiman handling the album's production duties could rub anyone the wrong way, as it did me, but I think that fear escalated into something exaggerated. Sure, the Disturbed influences do come through at times and they are the album's greatest flaws as well, but Trivium and the music they present here are far better than anything Disturbed has ever released. It's like comparing classic Metallica to Nickelback. I've got to admit that David Draiman did one thing right, though. He gave this album a pretty cool sound. The guitar tone in particular is sweet. It's kind of like a modern day Ratt-esque sound.\n\nIf you enjoyed the band's earlier material then you should most likely find some treats here. At least as long as you can keep an open enough mind to overcome the fact who pulled the band's strings during this album's creation. The most notable Disturbed influences are what really drags the score down, though.\n\nCheck-outs: \"Strife\", \"No Way To Heal\", \"Through Blood And Dirt And Bone\", \"Incineration: The Broken World\".\n",
        "\nI've never been a big fan of Trivium, I wouldn't even consider myself a fan of them. I tried to listen to their music a couple of times before, but the result was always the same, until now.\n\nThe Sin and the Sentence captivated my attention just a day before its official release with the song \"Betrayer\". When I first heard it I was kind of skeptical but astonished at the same time. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, until I did a little bit of research and found out that their new drummer was the same dude from Brain Drill. Then I listened to the whole album and instantly it became one of my favorites in a long time.\n\nThe amount of dynamism that Trivium achieved, along with the flawless production will make you put this album endlessly on repeat. The music is great from any point you want to listen to, there are really fast and heavy songs, as well as some parts that are more on the melodic side but without being too soft or acting as a mere filler. I wasn't expecting The Sin and the Sentence to be so massive and energetic, (I wasn't even expecting something to be honest) since, as I stated before, I've never been a Trivium fan.\n\nThe work of Alex Bent behind the drums is beyond anything you could imagine on a Trivium album, especially after their previous release. He even added some blast beats here and there, which resulted in a very strong feel of brutality. I seriously consider that the drumming is definitely one of the strongest points on this album.\n\nRegarding the vocals, Matt Heafy is finally screaming again, and his voice sounds better than ever. The harsh parts blend perfectly with the rest of the clean vocals, creating dichotomy during the whole album. The only part I didn't like at all was somewhere between to the half of the sixth song, since it sounds very Corey Taylor-esque. Nothing against the dude, I just don't think that his vocal style fits on this record.\n\nMoving forward almost to the end of the album, we found a seven minute song called The Revanchist, (which by the way was originally intended to be the name of this record) that stands out for having more \"progressive elements\" compared to the rest of the songs. At first it didn't catch me but I came to find it as a very solid and interesting piece.\n\nLastly, something that I especially enjoyed and that I consider more than worthy to mention is the fact that the bass lines are clean and loud among the whole album, there are even some parts where the bass shines over the other instruments, and as a bass player myself is something that I just can't get over it.\n",
        "\nWhat is going on with Trivium lately? Each album reeks of identity crises, and Silence in the Snow was such a pretentious, obtuse bore that I couldn't even formulate a review on it. Now we get The Sin and the Sentence, a concentrated throwback that clearly hopes to ride on that Ascendancy nostalgia, and while the album gets quite fucking heavy at times, some of the band's more recent missteps still plague the experience at multiple junctures. In hindsight, even albums like Vengeance Falls had a few killer cuts, but the band seems to eject a lot of their thrash influence on this one. Honestly, its a fucking mess at times, because even Ascendancy had plenty of thrashing discord. You can't just disregard that and hope for this to work.\n\nHeafy's vocals continue to annoy me, marring the otherwise melodically poignant \"Endless Night.\" Sure, his voice is more \"mature\" and trained now, but I miss the rawer quality of his cleans on tracks like \"Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies.\" His cleans now have this huskier quality to them, and it just sounds like a parody of his old self at times. It's almost like the band is parroting their old sound in a tongue-in-cheek manner, like they are taking the piss. The guitar tone is blubbery and corpulent, well produced and well suited for the staggered grooves that pockmark the album. And speaking of grooves, the album completely lacks speed, jerking into awkward vocal driven dirges on nearly every track. Sure, Ascendancy was criticized as modern at the time, but the moment \"Rain\" fired up you knew it was going to be a respectably heavy experience. Bent's drums are all over this thing, scattering beats underneath riffs that fail to speed up enough to match. It's a strange dichotomy.\n\nWhile I can't commit to enjoying any of these tunes from front to back, I thought that \"The Heart from Your Hate\" had potential, if not for those awful vocal driven verses - fucking stupid decision. \"Beyond Oblivion\" does have some balls, and there are competent moments throughout when the riffs lock into a passable stomping cadence. Honestly, I was taken aback by the lack of memorable melodies. There are shockingly few leads here. It's like Trivium is trying to half-sell out without losing the pretentious air they've picked up since the last album. Not the worst decision given the recent quality, but it doesn't quite work on The Sin and the Sentence.\n\nFor some reason it is really difficult to recreate that ~2005 metalcore vibe, and while Trivium are on a path perhaps worth investigating further, I'd like to see them get back to the less serious side that brought arena-pleasers like \"Anthem (We Are the Fire),\" \"Strife\" and \"A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation.\" Too much of The Sin and the Sentence is mere throwaway - faceless padding with no hooks, dampened with needless dissonance. I wouldn't call the record an outright embarrassment, but as an experiment it certainly failed. Don't let anyone call this a viable return to form. You reading this, Heafy?\n",
        "\nWow, I was not expecting something so awesome! Trivium has returned with their best album since 2008\u2019s \u201cShogun\u201d. After two mediocre hit-and-miss albums in \u201cVengeance Falls\u201d and \u201cSilence in the Snow\u201d, Trivium has returned to rock your socks off with \u201cThe Sin and the Sentence\u201d. This album can be seen as a culmination of most of the band\u2019s albums, taking mostly the best aspects of the band\u2019s discography and melding it into this new hour-long affair. I can't really say I'm surprised at how awesome this album is after hearing the title-track a few months ago when it was released. However, this was the only of the singles I actually listened to initially. I decided, based on my own whim, that I would wait until the actual release of the album to hear \"The Heart from Your Hate\" and \"Betrayer\". In the end, was this decision of merit? Really I don't think it made much of a difference because these songs are both still solid. Now, on to the review!\n\nAs I previously stated, this album pretty much combines most of the good things that made up most of Trivium's previous albums. It has the singing which has been featured on every album but most heavily focused on with \"Silence in the Snow\". It has the thrashy riffs from \"Ascendancy\", \"The Crusade\", and \"Shogun\". It once again features harsh vocals from every one of the band's previous albums minus most of \"The Crusade\" and all of \"Silence in the Snow\". Basically, this is a Trivium melting pot full of some of the finest metal stew I've heard this year. Beginning with the title track, it's clear this album is not messing around. This song features blast beats which haven't been used in Trivium's music in a while. You'll actually hear blast beats again on songs like \"Beyond Oblivion\" and \"Betrayer\". This isn't a one time deal here. It's really cool to hear this technique used at a higher capacity this time around. Alex Bent is a very skilled drummer as we all know, currently playing in Brain Drill as well and has been involved with bands such as Hatriot and Battlecross, and even playing live for Rings of Saturn, Testament, and Decrepit Birth! This guy has a hell of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at only 24 years old! As an aspiring drummer myself, I'd really like to know his secrets. Anyway, I digress. His drumming here is absolutely amazing and I really hope Trivium holds on to this guy! Because we all know their track record with drummers...\n\nAs far as guitars go, this is, once again, Trivium's best since \"Shogun\". It's not quite on the same level because that album is likely their best and it would be a hard one to top. Most of the guitars here focus on similar ideas to \"Shogun\", containing riffs mostly in the thrash and melodic death metal realms. No, before anyone says anything, Trivium is still not a metalcore band. Some riffs such as the intro to \"Endless Night\" do sound metalcore influenced but there are no metalcore-defined breakdowns and even the hardcore-ish riffs aren't standard metalcore. Some of these more ballad-ish songs like \"Endless Night\" and \"The Heart From Your Hate\" are likely to be anthems shouted at the top of the lungs of angsty teenage kids and that's completely okay with me. It doesn't really matter. These songs are not the best from the album but they manage to hold their worth nicely. Solos are done tastefully and not overly flamboyantly. Meaning they don't detract from the musical flow and direction of the album. I think the first two tracks, the title track and \"Beyond Oblivion\", the latter containing the best chorus on the album, contain perhaps the best solos, rivaling \"Sever the Hand\", which also kicks some ass and sounds perhaps a bit darker overall but also very thrash metal influenced. \n\nMatt Heafy's vocals once again sound different here. They seemed to change in overall sound with \"The Silence in the Snow\", not only opting for a straight up clean vocal style with no screams, but his voice sounded more adaptable to clean singing, for better or worse. With \"The Sin and the Sentence\", his clean vocals sound like they did last time, but actually sound even better. And complemented with the re-addition of harsh vocals, they sound even better. Seriously, when it comes to screams and singing, Trivium has always been recognizable right off the bat. Matt's vocal style is one of complete originality which may spark arguments within the metal community but (hold your horses, I'm about to say a bad word for the first time in a review in a very long time) I couldn't give less of a flying fuck. Again, this is definitely his best vocal performance since \"Shogun\" was released. \n\nWhat we have here is definitely an album that will live on as one of Trivium's finest. It doesn't quite manage to top \"Shogun\" but is probably on or around the same level as \"Ascendancy\" was. I know Trivium garners a lot of negative attention due to their classification as a \"metalcore\" band, as unfair as that may be. I already can't wait to see what they come out with next!\n",
        "\nSince the beginning of Trivium, the band has adapted over time to different styles of music from metalcore, thrash metal, heavy metal and have been perfecting their music with better lyrics, arrangements and technique.\n\nThe Sin and the Sentence is a clear example of a more mature sound, having a clear influence of its predecessor album \"Silence in the Snow\" with some influences of previous albums, for example \"Shogun\" or \"Ascendancy\".\n\nThe song has fast parts, melodic parts, clean voices and screaming (Yes, screaming!), which gives a perfect touch, the vocal parts of Heafy have improved a lot in the last years, in addition the new drummer perfectly executes the song with good technique, in my opinion they must Keep Alex Bent, since he has been one of the best drummers that Trivium has had in the last years.\n\nIn conclusion the song is a perfect piece of a good mix of different influences that has had the band for more than 10 years.\n",
        "\nIt had only been approximately eight months since the release of the \"Blue Demo\" earlier in 2003, and Trivium had been hard at work (well, I assume so, seeing how young these dudes were back then) crafting their full-length release, \"Ember to Inferno\". What can we say about this album? For me, it is one of the band's best releases, falling slightly behind \"Ascendancy\" and \"Shogun\", and only being slightly better than \"The Crusade\". This wasn't the album that put them on the map, as it was a small release on Lifeforce Records before the band exploded into the heavy metal scene with their major label debut \"Ascendancy\" released a year and a half later. No, this was not really the album that established Trivium as a heavyweight band, but with it, they managed to prove their existence as a band in general, and they did it wonderfully. \"Ember to Inferno\" may have only been an ember in terms of publicity, but musically speaking, this album surely is an inferno. \n\nA short intro track entitled \"Inception, the Bleeding Skies\", which is the album's closing instrumental \"A View of Burning Empires\" played in reverse, quickly fades into the explosive \"Pillars of Serpents\". In my experience with Trivium, along with \"Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr\" from \"Ascendancy\", this was their first song I had ever heard. Trivium was originally recommended to me by a friend I had regular contact with between eighth and tenth grade before he moved out of the county. These two tracks were the ones he recommended me to check out from Trivium and out of those two, this one was the one I was more impressed with. It's more aggressive and quite a bit heavier. I really dug the melodic death metal influenced thrashy style the song let out and the guitar chugs made any teenager almost mess his pants. It's a great song for sure but after listening to the entire album in order, it becomes apparent that it's not even one of the best songs this album has to offer. No, that would be either \"Fugue (A Revelation)\" or \"Requiem\", two songs that were originally featured on the band's demo. These songs are done up even better here and the solo in \"Fugue\" is finalized, as well as the bouncy riff after the solo and bassline in \"Requiem\". It's clear Trivium was listening to a lot of the Gothenburg melodic death metal bands here and took a lot of influence from In Flames and Dark Tranquillity. \n\nMatt Heafy's vocal performance here is also light years better than the demo they put out only eight months prior. His screams sound more energetic and he doesn't seem to tire his voice out before the album's end, though he's even admitted the vocal recording process for this album was extremely hard and he was using an incorrect scream technique. His clean vocals are also much improved here and his voice doesn't sound as tired or strained. Aside from \"Fugue\" and \"Requiem\", there are plenty of other songs with huge choruses and amazing vocal performances in the cleans department. \"If I Could Collapse the Masses\", the title track, and the vastly improved \"My Hatred\" all fit into this category. The redone \"To Burn the Eye\" sounds far more devastating here with a crushing breakdown that is multiplied greatly this time around.\n\n\"When All Light Dies\" is the closing track and contains some really cool ideas, though ironically, my least favorite cleanly sang chorus on the album. Aside from this, it's a great track with some hateful screams and to me, almost works as a brother to \"To Burn the Eye\". It's the second longest track on the album at around 6 and a half minutes. This song, like \"To Burn the Eye\", also contains a crushing breakdown, but pales in comparison. Also, I should note that Trivium is not a metalcore band. They may utilize some metalcore ideas on some songs and albums, such as \"In Waves\", but here, they sound closer to a melodic death/thrash hybrid with some examples of an alternative metal sound. These breakdowns, which are really quite rare in Trivium's music, are not the same as those used by metalcore bands such as The Devil Wears Prada or Motionless in White, and are also different from the actual metal metalcore bands including Unearth and Killswitch Engage. There is none of that here. But, I digress. My apologies. As I was saying, this final song closes the album out fairly well and leads into the closing instrumental \"A View of Burning Empires\". This simple clean outro is absolutely gorgeous and one of my favorite moments on the album, as it takes the closing riff from \"When All Light Dies\" and mimics it in a gorgeous way. \n\nI do apologize for going off into the metalcore rant, but it had to be said. I really fail to see how this band does not qualify as \"tr00 metal\", and I have always felt that way. Trivium is one of the bands that took the New Wave of American Heavy Metal and really ran with it. \"Ember to Inferno\" was a great way to begin a career and soon after, the band would take off at high speed with \"Ascendancy\". It all began here. Well, as I said before, ACTUALLY began here. This remains one of my favorite Trivium releases for its raw energy and superb songwriting from these three young musicians, and it only opened the door wider for more great things to happen.\n",
        "\nBefore releasing their debut album \"Ember to Inferno\" later in 2003, Trivium exploded into the world of heavy metal with their \"Trivium EP\", otherwise referred to as the \"blue demo\". This demo contains seven tracks, the first four of which were re-recorded for \"Ember to Inferno\". The latter three are exclusive to this demo. There really isn't much going on here in terms of super complex songwriting, and the band at this point were just getting themselves established. Regardless, this is a fairly solid demo, with the first half being the strongest. \n\nGuitars are at the forefront of this recording. As with any other Trivium album, this is the driving force of the music. Every song features a cool solo and the riffing is extremely melodic in nature, which again, is no surprise. \"To Burn the Eye\" is the first track here and the longest, eclipsing the 7-minute mark. One of the songs that would be re-recorded for the full-length, this song contains a breakdown right before the solo that sounds absolutely destructive....on the full-length. Here, due to the thinner sound of the guitars, it sounds a bit flat. Not bad, just a bit flat. I think the two highlights of this demo are \"Fugue\" and \"Requiem\", two other songs that originated on this demo before being redone. I don't think they're done as nicely here but they still contain some of the finest riffs, though the solo in this version of \"Fugue\" is a bit different and I think is subpar in comparison. These songs have some of the highest soaring choruses on the demo. \"My Hatred\" is the fourth track that would end up being redone but here, I think it sounds a bit weak and Matt's vocals are beginning to sound somewhat tired to my ears.\n\nBy the time the second half of the demo commences with \"The Storm\", Matt's voice sounds fairly done in as far as the screams go. This song musically is a highlight, especially the intro, but because of the weakening vocals, it doesn't sound as powerful as it possibly could. Thankfully, this song has one of the finest solos on the entire demo. It definitely gives \"Requiem\" a run for its money. \"Demon\" closes this demo and is perhaps one of the most aggressive songs here, but by this point, the demo had become a chore for me to get through when I first gave it a listen. \n\nThis is definitely not a bad demo, and it's not the worst thing Trivium has ever done. Though about eight months later, the band would unleash \"Ember to Inferno\", and would drastically improve. The first four songs would be re-recorded and improved upon quite a bit but it's still nice to hear where the band was back in late 2002 and early 2003. One must keep in mind how young they were at the time, with Matt Heafy barely being 17 years old. This is only the spark that would eventually ignite a small ember into an inferno. It's a demo and it definitely works as one.\n",
        "\nTrivium is a band I have listened to for a long time now and were one of the bands that first graced my ears when I was just becoming familiar with metal. Really, their entire discography pleases me with the exception of \"Vengeance Falls\", which I just find to be boring. \"Silence in the Snow\" had some cool tunes on it and was a step up from \"Vengeance Falls\" but for the most part, it was fairly average and I expected more from Trivium. With \"The Sin and the Sentence\", the band's first new song since the last album was released, we hear some familiar sounds from the band's early days that we really haven't heard much since perhaps 2008's \"Shogun\" but we also get a fresh new take on the band.\n\nThis is the first recording the band has made with Alex Bent, their new drummer. Seriously, it seems Trivium switches between drummers more often than I change my socks in a week (yes, I wear a new pair of socks every day). I really hope the band keeps him. His playing is extremely competent and one of the reasons this song is as enjoyable as it is. He uses quite a few blast beats here and there, and this is something that I really hoped Trivium would do more of after that \"Shattering the Skies Above\" song from 2010. This adds a more extreme feel to the music and it's a very welcomed change. \n\nIn the vocal department, this has a lot of clean singing from Matt Heafy, which shouldn't be a surprise after \"Silence in the Snow\", seeing as that album pretty much only featured clean vocals. Although, harsh vocals return once again and Corey throws in some screaming while Matt handles the singing, which sounds amazing here. It seems that his voice has finally hit its peak. \n\nIt seems this song alternates between melodic heavy metal and extreme metal, bordering on melodic death metal, quite a bit with the aforementioned blast beat drumming and harsh vocals but the guitars are also something to be noted here. This song begins with a riff that sounds very power metal-esque and is a breath of fresh air! The solos kick ass and the band seems to have their energy back. If this is any indication of how their new album will sound overall, I think Trivium may possibly still have their best album in them, maybe kicking \"Shogun\" off of its pedestal.\n",
        "\nTrivium are back and they\u2019ve armed themselves with a monster anthem in the formidable shape of \u201cThe Sin And The Sentence\u201d.\n\nLong time fans will probably be stoked to hear that the aggression is back, although tempered by the mainstream sounds found on 2015\u2019s Silence In The Snow. It\u2019s a thrilling combination as Matt Heafy\u2019s clean vocals (which have reached new heights) joust with the screams and growls of old! It\u2019s great to hear the man screaming his head off again and the clinical riffing and full-throated roars originally found on Ascendancy and Shogun \u2013 along with Shogun\u2018s propensity for epic songs if this 6min+ beast is anything to go by \u2013 suggest that something suitably monstrous is on the horizon.\n\nNew drummer Alex Bent (yep, another drummer!) equips himself incredibly well, bringing back the blast-beats and going suitably ape-shit throughout. He\u2019s a damn good fit\u2026.keep hold of him Trivium, for fucks sake!\n\nIncidentally, for those who bemoan the more traditional riffing and song structures favoured over the last few years, the final minute and a half of \u201cThe Sin And The Sentence\u201d finds Trivium at their absolute heaviest; a ferocious blast of thrash riffs and screams, you\u2019d have to go back to the birth of Trivium to find anything heavier.\n\nTrivium have always been underrated, they write consistently impressive albums that offer variety and extreme metal ferocity laced with mainstream accessibility and \u201cThe Sin And The Sentence\u201d is no exception. It\u2019s time to buy into them wholesale as they have proved time and time again that they are the headliners we\u2019ve been waiting for! With a back catalogue as strong as theirs and new material of this quality under their belts, Trivum\u2019s title as heavyweight contenders should now be set in stone! \n\nOriginally published on worshipmetal.com\n",
        "\nTrivium, as most metalheads know, had more than a bit of hype behind them when they released this, their second album, on Roadrunner Records 10 years ago. I'm not exactly sure how that hype was generated, since I was, in 2005, barely aware of metal beyond a few scattered pieces by the likes of Slipknot, Korn, Iron Maiden, and (weirdly now I think of it) Megadeth. Trivium registered on me fairly early when they won Kerrang! magazine's album of the year accolade and their name was screamed from the rooftops in said magazine. The fact that Kerrang! was a more mainstream rock and metal magazine than most of the music on this site (their second place was Nine Inch Nails' 'With Teeth' and the following year saw My Chemical Romance gain high praise) should indicate that Trivium's appeal might exclude some more staunchly traditional fans of heavy metal and speak more to the younger acolytes who grew up on NWOAHM bands like Machine Head, Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, and Chimaira. However, I wouldn't go as far as to say that an album like 'Ascendancy' lacked crossover appeal, since there are obviously enough classic stylistic tropes on display here to satisfy fans of metal's golden 80s era, in addition to the devices that brought it into the 21st century.\n\nThe band's influences are somewhat obvious yet varied enough to ensure that their material never descends into mindless worship music. The stamp of Metallica's 'Master of Puppets' is writ large on the riff work and melodic vocals of songs like 'The Deceived' and the thunderous closer 'Declaration', while the attitude of the Black Album era is also present in the stadium-gazing breakdown of 'A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation' and some of the dominant choruses on display, although the sound is drastically updated. Beyond Metallica, there are many other reference points that should delight old-school lovers, such as the inspired twin and lead guitar work of 'Like Light to the Flies', which shows great study in the field of Iron Maiden, Helloween, and Mercyful Fate. Nor is the trick a fluke, with gorgeous leads proving the highlight of several songs. The presence of the old guard is tempered by some definite contemporary traits, not least the breakdowns and hoarse screamed vocals that bite more than a little from the pie freshly cooked by Killswitch Engage, Darkest Hour, and Shadows Fall around the turn of the century. What is often underestimated in regards to Trivium is that they never fell into the same formulaic metalcore pattern as Killswitch, instead producing a more coherent and biting version of Shadows Fall's 'Of One Blood', which showed a greater desire to marry extreme and popular styles with a thirst for diversity and individuality. Though many elements of 'Ascendancy' can be recognized at first listen, many traits - and especially the combinations of traits - are Trivium's own, as can be instantly discovered by a glimpse at the song titles, lyrics, and unique melodic sensibility that the band made their own from day one.\n\nWhat has probably upset some people and delighted others is that Trivium's mixture of styles is not consistent with any recognized group of bands. Unlike many of their modern metalcore brethren, they clearly have two very talented guitar players in their midst, yet they are still happy to produce breakdowns and a few chug and fill riffs alongside other thrash and classic parts. Matt Heafy's vocals have no obvious desire to imitate Metallica other than a few brief sections, such as the \"Open fire\" chorus of 'A Gunshot...', and take heed of the modern trend to switch styles from harsh to clean at strategic points. However, Heafy has neither the most brutal screams nor the most saccharine cleans, resulting in one great strength and one glaring weakness. The bonus of his voice is that the clean sections remain - for the most part - anthemic and not whining, while his plain and unemotive roar is to the detriment of an eloquent and interesting set of lyrics that retell the stories of angst and anger in creative ways. The solos are the most obviously traditional element of 'Ascendancy', though the drumming packs its own punch beyond the mere classic/modern dichotomy. Bass is sadly not a feature, even if the guitars remain dynamic enough without much of its aid.\n\nThe thing that really made Trivium stand out in 2005 and should keep them head and shoulders above most of their competition is their unerring ability to write songs. I don't simply mean that they write memorable music, but that the way Heafy and Beaulieu are able to develop ideas during the likes of 'The Deceived' is sure proof that they have a grasp of their craft beyond making melodic choruses and punishing riffs. The progression of 'The Deceived' from churning metalcore riff to chugging thrash fills, into the chorus and back out to a calm lead melody and placid after chorus shows more imagination than any number of more generic metalcore, thrashcore, and modern melodeath bands who understand the main components of their art, yet lack the knack and finesse to glue those parts together. The weaving of classic twin guitar melody and martial drumming in the solo section is also a neat idea that has become a lot more prevalent in the wake of this album.\n\nAs such, there aren't really any bummers among the 12 songs that make up 'Ascendancy'. There are a few weaker moments, such as the rather plain and stuttering metalcore/deathcore of 'Suffocating Sight', though parts of that still stick in my mind, while the more subtle title track doesn't come off as the band hoped. Problems tend to appear when Trivium stick to one idea for too long, especially in the verses, when Heafy's voice quickly wears thin, though they keep things moving quickly, always introducing new ideas and filtering out most of the poor ones before they become too harmful. 'Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr', for example, has some ideas that are clearly a cut above the norm, yet it takes a little long to arrive at that point to be completely satisfying, also afflicting the two closing tracks, which are longer, though could have been more compact. 'Declaration', the 7 minute closer, has some of the best and most varied guitar work of the album (how many musicians must have coveted those spiralling licks of the fast-paced riffs), yet sometimes feels disconnected, seeming like a compilation of several discrete movements, something that the band would improve by the time they reached the more complicated 'Shogun' album. One gets the feeling that if the band recorded 'Ascendancy' today, they would remove a song or two and tighten up some of the structures to avoid occasional monotonous moments.\n\nYou might come down on either side of the fence regarding 'Ascendancy', largely depending on how open you are to having classic ideas tampered with and how willing you are to forgive some minor shortcomings, though there should be something to appreciate for old and new fans alike. Arguably, Trivium have lost some ground in the race for metal frontrunners since 2005, but 'Ascendancy' still remains a spirited album that will excite more than it irritates.\n",
        "\nIn what is now (in 2015) a seven-album-long career, Trivium have clearly been a band that can't stay in one place for long. They started out as a fairly standard metalcore/thrash hybrid with two unique things: the fact that they were very young when their debut Ember To Inferno was released, and some particularly interesting guitar work, especially in the solo department. Then they infamously went for more of a traditional thrash formula on The Crusade before simultaneously advancing backward (the return of harsh vocals) and forward (the expanding of song structures) on Shogun. They would later go back to a more aggressive, concise format on In Waves before streamlining their sound on Vengeance Falls and especially Silence in the Snow.\n\nAs one would expect, then, Trivium are a tough band to consistently enjoy. The sorts of metal consumers who view Ascendancy as a massive accomplishment likely look down on The Crusade and Silence in the Snow, for example...and vice versa. But there is one album that fuses all of the phases of the band into a cohesive and effective whole, all while emphasizing Trivium's strong points and minimizing their weaknesses. That album is Shogun.\n\nLet's look at the band's personnel. Lead guitarist Corey Beaulieu is often the most complimented of the foursome, and deservedly so, as he consistently creates not only compelling and fitting solos, but also propulsive leads. One of the most underrated aspects of Trivium's music is his ability to provide understated but surprisingly deft lead work overtop of the band's choruses. Vocalist/guitarist Matt Heafy's guitar work isn't on the same level as Beaulieu's, but he's an effective lead foil who also can come up with more hits than misses in the riffing department. Shogun is Trivium's last album with original drummer Travis Smith, who has earned quite his fair share of plaudits for his lightning-fast bass work, and he's inventive in other ways as well. Paolo Gregoletto emerged as a superior bassist by the Shogun era, too.\n\nBut there's also the matter of Heafy's vocals, which pale in comparison to the outfit's instrumental talent. He's consistently improved throughout his career, so by Shogun, he'd come a long way from Ember To Inferno, but let's not forget that, on The Crusade, the guy fell pretty flat in trying to emulate James Hetfield's limited vocalizing. He has a fairly low natural voice, shows limited ability to move from a clean, reedy timbre to anything more aggressive (other than outright screaming), and isn't exactly pitch-perfect (though hardly embarrassing). I'm not an expert on harsh vocals, but those in the know on those seem to think he's hardly a transcendent talent there, either.\n\nHow should Trivium maximize their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses, then? Seems like they should basically admit they're a progressive metal band and play longer, more ambitious tracks that emphasize their instrumental proficiency, all while keeping it just song-focused enough to keep things structured and get the most possible out of Heafy's voice. And that's pretty much exactly what Shogun does.\n\nThis is a big-sounding, well-produced album; the guitars get the low-end crunch going when needed without losing clarity and still maintain a lot of force and presence in higher registers. Gregoletto's bass cuts through the mix well (check the end of \"Kirisute Gomen\" for a great example), Smith's drums boom and his cymbals find a nice niche in the mix, and Heafy's vocals are managed better than on any other Trivium album. It is easily a sonic step up from their more muddy previous efforts.\n\nThe biggest jump here, though, is in the songwriting department. Most of these tracks are 5-7 minutes, giving the band enough room for minute-long solos and some arrangement twists and turns. Verses switch between clean and harsh vocals, while most of the choruses introduce the now-identifiable surging hooks, with octave chords or eighth-note Beaulieu leads giving extra life to Heafy's decent midrange vocals. \n\nWhat's nice about the songs on Shogun is how the band remains consistent throughout without having the songs run together. \"Kirisute Gomen\" is bookended by some big tom work from Smith--in between, Heafy roars through some thrashy verses, a clean chorus pops in out of nowhere (much like famed Ascendancy track \"A Gunshot To The Head of Trepidation\"), and there's a massive solo tradeoff section with some cool wah work. \"Down From The Sky\" maintains the aggression throughout before opening up into an urgent chorus, a really excellent lesson in tension and release. \"Into The Mouth of Hell We March\" has some more outright thrash influences and a clean/harsh vocal tradeoff chorus. \"The Calamity\" is a shorter, more concise and punchy version of the band's attacking formula, \"Of Prometheus and the Crucifix\" explodes from its first note before riding on mostly clean vocals on top of some outright bouncy rhythm playing, and \"Like Callisto To A Star In Heaven\" introduces low-end, almost Warrel Dane-esque vocals in its chorus.\n\nThe masterwork here, though, is the closing title track, which remains the band's most compelling accomplishment to date. Given its near-twelve-minute runtime, one might expect the band to rely on a bunch of instrumental gimmicks here, but the soloing only occasionally pops up and actually isn't very memorable when it does. Rather, this is a really exceptional progressive metal epic with a multi-sectioned approach, starting out as another classic Trivium anthemic stomper before quieting down into the album's only real quiet moment in the middle; the track then builds back up from there, winding through a blinding array of styles before climatically arriving back at the masterful chorus.\n\nIt is a shame Trivium didn't fully embrace their progressive elements on future releases, because this really is the culmination of their musicianship. They remain true to their roots while really reaching another level, both in terms of songwriting and performance, here. They would quickly lose all of this momentum on followup In Waves, a disappointing and misguided back-to-basics record that eschews much of what makes Shogun so formidable. As such, Shogun really is the fulcrum and essence of Trivium's sound--the one time they had all of the elements in without losing coherence--and it is thus both the ideal starting point for listeners wanting to check the band out, and easily their brightest moment to date.\n",
        "\nMuch has been made of the change in direction on Trivium's seventh full-length offering, influenced by the classic metal of Dio, Iron Maiden, etc. and eliminating the screaming vocals that seem to oscillate from focus to afterthought on other releases by the band. Many who see the harsh vocals as essential to the band's sound will undoubtedly find the move unconscionable; I, on the other hand, only like a couple of bands that employ non-melodic singing (actually, Shogun is one of the few albums with harsh vocals that I really like), so I welcome the change.\n\nGoing all-clean with the vocals is, in itself, not exactly a fix for the issues that have made Trivium fail to come up with a suitable followup to Shogun, because a) they still have to write good songs, which have been in short supply on In Waves and Vengeance Falls, and b) let's face it...nobody's listening to Trivium for the lead vocal quality. In fact, the idea of Matt Heafy trying to be Ronnie James Dio, in the abstract, isn't all that much sillier than, say, Lemmy trying to sing Crimson Glory songs. \n\nThankfully, the band here does come up with their most consistent set of songs aside from their 2008 masterpiece, and Heafy retains a sense of his limits. The song selection on Silence in the Snow is very consistent, and the use of only melodic vocals gives the band a far more unified sound than they've had on most past releases. This is the sort of big, punchy, riff-heavy album that Avenged Sevenfold wanted to make with Hail To The King, only Trivium manage to avoid the pitfalls that undermined that record (ironically, one of those being blatantly ripping off Metallica, something Trivium was accused of with The Crusade).\n\nIndeed, except for the plodding \"Until The World Goes Cold\" and uneven closer \"Breathe In The Flames,\" Trivium create a set of driving, surging, near-anthemic, riffy midtempo metal here that rarely misses. The album is well-produced, with new drummer Mat Madiro's drums sounding absolutely massive, Heafy and Corey Beaulieu's guitars with a nice array of tones that give the music a variety of different feels, and Paolo Gregoletto's bass has plenty of moments. There's more vocal harmonizing and interaction here than past releases, as well.\n\nHighlights of the album include the opening duo of singles \"Silence in the Snow\" and \"Blind Leading the Blind,\" which boast a surging immediacy and great riffing. \"Dead And Gone\" features an unusually gritty vocal performance from Heafy that evokes M. Shadows at times, \"The Thing That's Killing Me\" has more uptempo energy and great guitar work, and \"Beneath The Sun\" is another classic midtempo surger with strong vocals.\n\nFor all of these positives, Silence in the Snow is not a perfect album. For one, as much as Heafy has worked to improve his voice (and it does show throughout the album), his somewhat reedy baritone voice is never going to touch those of the heroes who inspired this album. He knows this, and so he's never straining into the fifth octave or anything, but his inability to lend that extra, heroic dimension to the vocals makes many of the tracks merely good rather than great. There are several songs where the the musical backdrop gets a little too subdued in the choruses, and so tracks like \"Pull Me From The Void\" aren't quite as anthemic as they should be. Further, the band is in concise, 3-5 minute formats throughout. On Shogun, the more progressive arrangements took some of the focus away from Heafy's vocals and let the band shine in other ways (most notably on the masterful title track), whereas here, the constrained format means the focus is more on the elements that the band is weaker in. By the end of the album, it gets a little tiring to hear Heafy singing in basically the same register, with similar tempos and similar guitar solo stylings throughout.\n\nUltimately, that means Silence in the Snow is an album of consistent quality, rather than having any massive high points. But the band is undoubtedly inspired and vital here, and they've created a very enjoyable set of songs that tap into their influences while still putting a uniquely Trivium spin on them. It's nice to hear Trivium in this context, a big step forward from their last two efforts and clearly the second-best album of the band's sneakily long career.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the monumental \"Shogun\" back in 2008, it would seem that Trivium would experience a downward spiral, beginning with the decent yet lacking \"In Waves\" in 2011. It wouldn't be until the monumental disappointment \"Vengeance Falls\" from 2013 that my opinion of this band's musical direction would completely turn sour. \"Vengeance Falls\" was an extremely boring album. The fact that it was produced by David Draiman didn't help either, as he obviously had influenced the musical direction the band took with that album. When I was informed that Trivium was returning this October with \"Silence in the Snow\", I didn't know what to think. On one hand, I was excited. On the other hand, however, I was concerned that they wouldn't be able to recover from their past release. Thankfully, after hearing this self-titled single for the upcoming disc, I am definitely a bit more hopeful. I will still most likely approach this album with caution, but this definitely sounds promising.\n\nRight off the bat, this song definitely sounds different that what these dudes were doing on \"Vengeance Falls\". Musically, it is somewhat of a cross between \"Shogun\" and \"In Waves\". It's not as thrashy as \"Shogun\" but it's also not as metalcore-esque as \"In Waves\", basically meeting in the middle of those two albums while basically forgetting about \"Vengeance Falls\". At times, the guitar riffs sound very influenced by power metal, which isn't a territory these guys have really ever ventured into. The riffs are epic in nature and quite melodic. One thing I've always personally enjoyed about Trivium is their ability to create effectively melodic metal songs. Matt's vocals are also done very well here and add a lot to the already melodic song. However, aside from the power metal influenced riffing, there really isn't anything completely original or innovative going on here. This is one of the song's tragic flaws but it's also extremely hard to be completely original with music nowadays. Ideas are being recycled left and right from artists who have already done the exact same thing. This is a good metal song but really, that's about all it is.\n\nSure, this may not be an epic Trivium masterpiece. It still is a good song that does the band justice. Trivium was one of the bands to really get me into metal and while I am aware they have a poor reputation with a vast majority of metal fans, I will always have a soft spot for them in my heart. I really can't wait to hear the rest of this album and what it has to offer when it comes out on the second of October. Judging by this, it will definitely be an improvement upon \"Vengeance Falls\".\n",
        "\nLet's start with a few questions. Did you ever listen to an album just because you liked it? Did you ever listen to an album without having to justify that choice to anyone? And lastly, isn't that sort of the whole point of heavy metal? The majority of people I know don't listen to me if I tell them that Iron Maiden are awesome because of their twin guitar harmonies, wailing vocals, and herd-of-cattle rhythm section. That's because they're listening to Jay-Z or Lady Gaga or whoever (this review is going to look like a product of its time in 5 years, when the reader will be like, \"I know Iron Maiden, but who's Lady Gaga?\"**) and don't give a fuck who I think is good. But it would be pretty stupid of me not to do the same in return and not listen to who I liked. So that's why I'm sitting here listening to Shogun, although - ironically - I now have to justify my feelings about it.\n\nThis album is not lacking in diversity or musical merit. The opener, for example, goes: gentle acoustics, ceremonial gong, classic metal intro chords, gang shout, chuggy metalcore riff, spiralling modern (melodic) death. And that's in the first 80 seconds. I really don't have a problem with bands pillaging bits of other bands' sounds if they combine those pieces into something new and Trivium certainly do that without ever sounding like merely the sum of those pieces. The band have that modern metalcore leaning that doesn't sit well with everyone, but then again no one would be listening to them if they sounded exactly like their influences. Trivium add a ton of groove and heaviness to any of the classic bits incorporated into their sound. I love the momentum that the thrash influence gives their modern sound and it's also the reason I can't sit still through a song like 'Insurrection', because the band have an energy and velocity that comes from more than just playing fast. I wouldn't go quite as far as to say that they play by the seat of their pants, but at their best they get me on the edge of my seat.\n\nAll this couldn't be done without having 4 instrumentalists of a very high calibre. Admittedly, there are some choices that I wouldn't have made in their shoes (I don't really care for breakdowns, for example), but that also means there are some things I don't really expect. The muted intro to 'The Calamity', with its stop and go vocal rhythm is striking when compared to the smooth melodic chorus that follows it, then there is the band's surprisingly good grasp of atmosphere and dynamics, plus their refusal to make anything too simple. Although the actual style of playing isn't progressive, the songwriting does bear its stamp, meaning that the album doesn't become predictable in its passage from verse to chorus to verse again. The extra guitar parts are strong in this sense, because they give the choruses a soaring push and make sections distinct from one another, while the leads vary in style between twin, melodic, atmospheric, and shredding. The riffs (especially some of the verse riffs in the middle part of the album) could use a little more work, but when they are meant to strike they do strike, like on 'Throes of Perdition', where a few stand alone.\n\nThe rhythm section keeps the band together without doing anything too extraordinary. The bass is not distinctly audible but has a juicy, bouncy tone when it does emerge that keeps the energy high. The drumming is actually very comparable to Devildriver's style, with a lot of aggression coming from the smaller parts of the kit, not the kicks, which means that the songs stay crisp and catchy rather than descending into a rolling barrage of \"heaviness\" that would lose the melodic nuance from the sound. The vocals are something of a two-way street and really need a good backing to be decent. The faster sections are acceptable and a few of the better constructed choruses sound big, like on 'Down from the Sky', but Matt Heafy just doesn't have a very appealing voice at mid-pace, sounding neither brutal nor melodic.\n\nThe lyrics, on the other hand, are way above the level one normally hopes for from a metal band. Matt Heafy has dipped deep into ancient literature and pulled out a handful of interesting pieces from The Odyssey and the Greek tragedies that give this album a character that it wouldn't otherwise possess. 'He Who Spawned the Furies', for instance, is about Cronos/Saturn eating his children, which is at once cultural and a great subject for a metal song. It's these little touches that puts Shogun above some of the more generic modern releases and, added to the sheer excitement the band are sometimes able to generate, particularly in the solos (I will point you in the direction of the title track's last few minutes), makes a more than respectable album from a very capable - if occasionally misguided - band.\n\n\n**5 YEAR EDIT: My bad. Lady Gaga hasn't disappeared.\n",
        "\nTrivium have consistently proved that their musicianship knows no bounds. After the critical acclaim of the album \"Ascendancy\" and the reputable thrash follow up of \"The Crusade\" Shogun had a lot to live up to... And I believe that it did that and more. \n\nIn terms of Musical style, the band returned to their metalcore roots, but still keeping that undertone of thrash metal consistent while adding musings of melodic death metal here and there. As a result, the songs came across as very diverse and varied whilst all standing alone from each other (despite some of the song's intros sounding similar). The faster thrashier parts of the songs definitely had some clear Metallica \"...And Justice for All\" influences which worked well alongside Trivium's harsh screaming vocals. \n\nMatt Heafy's vocal work really makes a solid statement that Trivium are a musical force to be reckoned with, and that they will not stop until they reach perfection. His screams were a lot more coherent than earlier releases, and his clean vocal work showed the lower end of Heafy's vocal frequencies to be as equally impressive as his higher singing voice. \n\nThe introduction of 7-string guitars to The Crusade was an interesting idea, but I don't believe Trivium truly harnessed the ability to master these instruments until the creation of Shogun. Whilst clearly understanding the fundamentals of using such an instrument, the band did not use it conventionally. They combined the playing styles of both standard tuned music and drop tuned music to create a beautifully brilliant blend of traditional heavy metal with some modern metal influences as well. However, despite the great musicianship on both Corey Beaulieu and Heafy's guitar solos, in the two times I have seen Trivium play live; they both seem uncomfortable playing the complicated solos in a live setting. \n\nThe album's bass and drum work was also next to none. The drum and bass combo of Travis Smith and Paolo Gregoletto has always worked well in Trivium, and whilst this was Travis' last release with Trivium, he certainly didn't hold back. The punchy tone of Smith's playing emphasizes the aggressive tone of the songs, while Paolo's smooth finger-picking style allows the beat to flow majestically. \n\nIf I had one track to listen to for the rest of my life, it would be the song \"Shogun.\" The nearly 12 minute long mammoth has pretty much everything you want in a good metal song. A heavy riff, a few unconventional bridges, a catchy chorus, a soothing clean section, a blues solo (yes, a blues solo) and of course, a blisteringly fast climax to finish on before returning to the chorus. The song was so good it even made me physically frustrated that I don't own a 7-string so I could learn how to play it. That's what I call inspiration.\n",
        "\nTo Trivium's credit, they realized the bomb they had in their hands with Shogun and swiftly abandoned that overblown avenue. In Waves drops nearly all of the clinical thrash influence that had begun seeping into the group's formula in varying degrees on both the record directly preceding it and The Crusade. This should signal a substantial decrease in memorability, but the group has wisely attempted what is essentially the second coming of Ascendancy. As such, metalcore dominates the genre palette, with occasional deviations into more experimental waters regarding song structure and efficiently-picked palm mutes that exist as the final gasp of the style put forth during the group's weaker period.\n\nWhile it goes without saying that In Waves is an improvement over Shogun, it's not all wine and roses. I have to stress that while Trivium was never an original group by any stretch of the imagination, they hit a relatively enviable stride with Ascendancy, and through that the band more or less stumbled into mainstream recognition and (arguable) greatness. Take the same formula as before, accrue six years of exposure to the mainstream music business, and something similar to In Waves should begin to take shape. To speak in broader terms, the band is seriously forcing a stylistic reversal here, and the music suffers somewhat as a result. I almost want to give Trivium a free pass on this album's terms alone, as they had boxed themselves into a corner that required them to either sell their souls or cut and run, and they clearly attempted the latter on the approach path to In Waves.\n\nThe controversial departure of Smith and interjection of newcomer Nick Augusto behind the kit was a wise choice in hindsight. With a style clearly more rooted in death metal than any of the genres Trivium draws influence from, he forces the band to scramble and improvise just to keep up with him. Heafy has disclosed in interviews that he had to significantly reign Augusto's abilities in just to keep the music running at a balanced gradation. Despite being the odd man out in more ways than one, Augusto is a good fit for the group and helps draw the listener's attention away from many of In Waves' less than stellar inner-workings. I, for one, would be interested in listening to what he could do while running at full speed, as he still manages to rip out some blastbeats along with a few creative fills and atypical patterns at multiple junctures here. Overall, not a bad debut at all.\n\nI really have issues with some of the riffs here, though. Trivium has never been a band to include many (if at all) breakdowns and lowest common denominator crap like that, but for some reason there is a lot of that here. Check out that tepid, stop-start mess of a riff that constitutes the majority of the title track. I can't even say that it grooves nicely, as it just plods like no other, occasionally giving way to the otherwise passable chorus. Sometimes the band comes damn close to their primary goal here, as \"Caustic Are the Ties that Bind\" could easily slip into Ascendency's procession without anybody being able to tell the difference. \"A Skyline's Severance\" is a beast of its own making, though. Augusto really gets cooking during the verses and the riffs are quite effective in isolation. It certainly helps that In Waves boasts a peerless guitar tone, but it is decent all the same. Other than the lame ass half-ballad \"Of All These Yesterdays,\" nothing here is truly vomit-worthy by any measure. The band attempts a similar coup with \"Forsake Not the Dream,\" but its more balanced disposition works in its favor and it ends up being one of the highlights.\n\nIn fact, In Waves is passable on the whole and is a required pickup if you really enjoyed Ascendancy. While I have the privilege of knowing that the band stumbled again immediately afterwards with Vengeance Falls, this came off as a consummate return to form after the meandering and atrocious Shogun. The band overreaches a bit as far as re-implementing their older style, but there are a number of tracks here that are well worth the time of fans of this style. Some of the modern influences hurt it a bit, but for Trivium you gotta take what you can get, and I'll take this.\n",
        "\nHas going halfway back to the old sound ever worked for any band, ever? Add Trivium to the list of well-known groups that tried rearranging a formula that wasn't exactly broken, and then found out far too late that the joke was on them and tried to retroactively save face. This joke is of course The Crusade, and while even that album boasted a few winners like \"Ignition,\" \"Detonation,\" and \"Tread the Floods,\" I can't necessarily say the same regarding Shogun. While there is certainly a higher level of maturity oozing throughout the lyrical concepts and overall vision on this one, it just reeks of the band trying too hard to reattach their recently-shed old skin. Imagine the pretentious title track from The Crusade stretched to fill nearly an entire album (and oh boy is this one a protracted slog), and you don't need me to tell you that Shogun is quite the experience to sit through.\n\nWhat perhaps frustrates me even more regarding albums like this is that they often come off as consummate returns to form on first blush. Somehow this frequently spawns a contingent of unwavering fans who feel the need to defend the album with relentless vigor. So to set the record straight, don't let anybody tell you this is a quality throwback to the band's first two efforts. Through the catch-all paradigm Trivium feels the need to employ here, Shogun embodies the time-worn adage of: \"jack of all trades, master of none.\" Heafy's harsh vocals have returned, but are only used sparingly and were never really that great to begin with. The riffs, while mercifully closer to Ascendancy in basic execution, can't even come close to The Crusade's better moments. Sometimes you can explicitly hear Trivium trying to rip their older material off, like on \"Of Prometheus and the Crucifix,\" which wants to be \"Drowned and Torn Asunder\" but can't even connect the dots and ends up overshooting its goal by a wide margin. \n\nThe entire ordeal just drips ostentation, as the opener \"Kirisute Gomen\" neatly lays out for easy analysis. The darker atmosphere is a nice change of pace, as is that grumbling bruiser of a riff bubbling under the verses, but does this need to be nearly seven minutes long? Ascendancy atypically ended with two of it's longer numbers in both \"Departure\" and \"Declaration,\" but they each featured decent payoffs thanks to either the clean vocals, busy song structures, or both. Toss \"Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis\" into the same boat as the opener, as both are complete wastes of time and a piss-poor way for Shogun to begin. Nearly all of the rest falls prey to the same pitfalls as The Crusade, only with fewer highlights and less thought put into the riffs. Occasionally we get a melodic lick that reminds us of days long gone, but what else can one do but dwell on the past when Trivium is currently banging out such swill?\n\nThe interesting thing is, somehow this abortion of an album accidentally results in one of the best songs Trivium has ever written. \"Into the Mouth of Hell We March\" may seem rather by-the-numbers at first, but the chorus shines like a supernova and absolutely screams of Ascendancy to my ears. The way the clean vocal section segues into the melodic lick immediately afterward, that is what I'm talking about. It is no accident that one of the catchier tracks ends up being the sole highlight, as the dour atmosphere that the band feels the need to blanket the rest of Shogun with in an attempt at being seen as mature certainly does them no favors. The title track is almost as bad as it's counterpart from The Crusade, and other than picking up for a few moments immediately after the pointless slow section, it collapses in on itself in short order and adds nearly twelve minutes of surplus bulk with nothing of value gained.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin comes in the form of some scant Eastern-tinged melodies that pop up here or there, trying to sell the subject matter to the easily deceived. We get it, Heafy. You were born in Japan, but you are about as Japanese as a cosplay convention in a West Virginia shopping mall. A good example is \"Down from the Sky,\" which intrigues mightily with that opening riff, but then discards it like a used wrapper once it has served its purpose and burns another nearly six minutes doing absolutely nothing of note. If my arm was twisted in an effort to get me to point out improvements over The Crusade, I suppose that the solos on this one are more tolerable. Not even close to the first two records, but certainly an avenue worth continuing down on Trivium's part. Shogun is a huge waste of what seems to be a sizable amount of effort on the band's part. What the hell happened? Is this real life? Well, Trivium still sucks eggs, so I suppose it is.\n",
        "\nFew individuals can drop The Crusade in conversation without Heafy's vocal transition being brought up. The controversy has certainly overshadowed the music, and many a Trivium fan has thrown this album to the proverbial wolves on that principle alone. The concept had potential, as Heafy's inert, simpering roars have always been an explicit flaw that had to be hurdled in order to enjoy either of the band's first two records. Ascendancy earned some extra lasting power compared to Ember to Inferno because the cleans were relatively well-executed and added some variety to the entire ordeal. The biggest issue with The Crusade is the delivery of these half-shouts Heafy feels the need to generously radiate throughout the album. On their own they are alright, but through the implementation of this \"middle ground\" of sorts, his clean timbre has been almost totally disposed of. I can't believe I am singling out Heafy's clean vocals as a sorely missed constituent, but a void is most certainly felt here.\n\nIf The Crusade does anything correct, it gets off on the right foot. The \"Ignition\" / \"Detonation\" combo is a damn effective opener and showcases the alternate style being purported by Trivium here. This album is certainly faster than Ascendancy was, and there is a moderate level of technicality surging in and out of the riffs. Select moments of The Crusade can certainly be labeled as solid thrash at many junctures, as it avoids the inclusion of many of the nauseating modern influences that dogged the band's earlier career. So from a certain point of view, this album certainly builds suspense and anticipation to equal its notoriety. \n\nSuspense and anticipation that comes to a grinding halt, as nearly every remaining track is a \"subtract\" in one fashion or another. One minute Trivium is busting out passable fist-raisers like \"Entrance to the Conflagration\" and \"Anthem (We are the Fire),\" the next they are aping their past in the atrocious second coming of \"Dying in Your Arms\" with \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart.\" Man, this song is just fucking pitiful and deserves its own special mention. It makes the track it wants to be sound like a near-classic. Listen to the horrible, phoned-in lyrics on the chorus, as it stands out like a sore thumb in the procession and seriously hampers what little credibility the music around it boasts.\n\nThe Crusade is certainly an album of multiple fits and starts, as there are select moments of quality that can't help but rise above the raw sewage the rest of the material so rightfully occupies. \"Tread the Floods\" is almost on par with the two opening cuts, as it features some great melodic licks and an awesome chorus. The verses drag like the song sprouted a square wheel, however, and only make it worth a passing glance on the whole. \"And Sadness Will Sear\" and \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\" both have their impressive, darker moments where the riffs really slide into their comfort zone and deliver some punishing, crunching passages. Most of the rest embodies the infamous nebulous mass of filler I normally associate with '90s Overkill, and nothing is certainly lost if the listener jumps from \"Detonation\" to \"Tread the Floods\" and calls it a day immediately afterward.\n\nThe final slap to the face is the \"epic,\" protracted bore that is the title track. I can't say that I fully comprehend what Trivium was going for with this one, as it comes off as a slightly better-structured jam session that was forced into the procession as a space-filler and telegraphed deviation from the rather typical song structures the rest of the material features. It could have served as a relatively potent dumping ground for the band's typically memorable solo work (which is irritatingly scant elsewhere on The Crusade), but it really doesn't know what it wants to be, and just chases it tail until it is forced to end by the powers that be.\n\nSo yeah, it's a fucking mess overall. Trivium tries to take emulation to whole new level here, and while they were certainly never the most original group around, their second record deserves a fair bit of the recognition it has received over the years. The Crusade sowed the seeds of mediocrity that the band has never been able to fully shake, even eight years later. Procure the first two tracks, check out \"Tread the Floods\" on YouTube or something, and kindly pull the plug on the rest.\n",
        "\nCurse you, Trivium. I hex you for destroying what little credibility I have left. When asked, I have always instinctively steered listeners towards the group's first two records, and Ascendancy will always earn the \"listenable\" merit from me. It may seem natural to assume Ember to Inferno is even better, but the sad fact is that it lacks much of what's to come. Yes, it features \"thrashy\" riffs alongside some throwback, Metallica-inspired song structures and overall pacing, but it also draws heavily from a stagnated pool of more modern influences that really dog the entire experience. Add Trivium's lack of a clear purpose and inability to know when to cut and run, and Ember to Inferno finds itself doused by the flames of inanity.\n\nIt starts so promising too, with \"Pillars of Serpents\" being a real riff monster that outclasses nearly anything the band has composed since. It is arranged in a decidedly less overambitious way than most of the material here, and comes off as infinitely more appealing as a result. Starting from this point, I could easily just end the review by warning the listener to avoid the odd-numbered tracks (which interestingly all blow ass in some way or another) - but let's look a bit closer. Heafy certainly knows how to inveigle the listener from the get-go, as songs like \"Requiem\" and \"Falling to Grey\" open with searing melodic passages that perk ears up right away, only to devolve into rather faceless genre posturing afterward with little else to see. This on its own isn't a huge detriment - as the riffs are passable on the whole - but it sets the stage for the clean vocals to phase in and blow everything to dust. I considered Heafy's shaky cleans an acquired taste of sorts on Ascendancy, but they are fucking atrocious here. It sounds like he is holding his nose while he sings, and the vocal melodies just simply aren't that great to begin with. \"Falling to Grey\" is the most depressing casualty of the clean vocals, as it would be damn enjoyable from start to finish without the chorus falling so flat.\n\nOther cuts like \"Requiem\" and \"Fugue (A Revelation)\" suffer from similar issues, but have their charms. The latter opens with what is probably the best riff on the entirety of Ember to Inferno and is mercifully much shorter than much of the rest of the material. The title track is decent though, and eerily foreshadows the namesake piece from Ascendancy in tone and delivery. It wouldn't sound out of place at all on the subsequent album, and the vocals on the chorus are well executed. While I don't own the 2004 reissue, I am still familiar enough with the bonus tracks to comment. \"Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies\" is easily the best one, and embodies some sort of stylistic halfway point between Trivium's first two records; overall a very enjoyable and highly melodic tune. The demo version of \"The Deceived\" is essentially the same minus the uneven production values, and \"Demon\" is a darker, more succinct slab at the direction Trivium started to unsatisfactorily implement on The Crusade.\n\nThe production values are alright, featuring a relatively snappy, airtight guitar tone that doesn't sound modern at all. Take the vocals away and Ember to Inferno would be a decent tribute to many of the group's more venerable influences. I also really dig Brent Young's loose-sounding, upfront bass timbre here. It very nearly reminds me of Overkill's W.F.O. at times, which you wouldn't necessarily associate with Trivium anyway. Ember to Inferno has some cool moments, but when one of the only two good songs is a bonus track, you can tell something isn't right. If you are really that dead-set on procuring Ember to Inferno, seek out the 2004 reissue. For the rest of us? Download \"Pillars of Serpents\" and \"Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies.\"\n",
        "\nWhat's that you say you hear? A vocalist that sounds like a dog barking to be fed? Believe it or not, it isn't Draiman from the recently-disbanded Disturbed, it is his newly-acquired whipping boy, archetypical metal scapegoat Matt Heafy. Always two there are, a master and an apprentice, and for reasons beyond my comprehension, Trivium has allowed Draiman (who produced Vengeance Falls) to influence much more than just the production process. While I feel that Trivium hasn't composed a truly great song since the \"Ignition\" and \"Detonation\" combo from The Crusade, a coup d'\u00e9tat of this caliber speaks of great desperation on their part.\n\nGoing from Ember to Inferno to this is quite a jarring experience, mainly because animated leadwork has been dropped in an attempt at making a scene. Heafy tries to take it's place with his melodic chops, and while he has a solid grasp on the Draiman-emulation he is trying to purport here, lingering concerns regarding a lack of hooks mar the entire experience. In this regard, Trivium leaves you out in the cold for the majority of Vengeance Falls, as the riffs are telegraphed with an irritatingly modern, plodding sheen. Heafy and especially Beaulieu have proven themselves to be apt soloists in the past, but at it's best this comes off as an average lampooning of Ten Thousand Fists-era Disturbed. I will always have room in my heart for said album, if only because of it's mainstream sensibilities and rampant catchiness. We get that basic framework here, but other than a few isolated moments of former glory, Vengeance Falls doesn't even come close to it's indignant goals. Heafy's choppy barks are as irritating as we remember them, but they are so scarcely utilized it simply comes off as a distraction rather than a conscious decision on the band's part.\n\nAs mentioned, leads are exceptionally scarce, although the few that do occasionally arise are well-executed. \"Strife\" opens with a decent melodic twin-lead that will manage to turn a few heads - even if the note progression has been beaten to dust by a million other bands. Still, it gets the job done and proves that this formula has some potential if delivered with conviction as opposed to trying to go halfway back to the old sound like Children of Bodom did with Blooddrunk. A more convincing example is \"Through Blood and Dirt and Bone,\" which manages to flip many of the right switches and contains most of the worthwhile clean vocal passages. Otherwise, it is difficult to even call Vengeance Falls piecemeal, as there are far too few notable riffs to make much of an impact. As expected, the solos are real barnburners, but something is certainly lost without memorable riffs leading in and out of them.\n\nOne could only imagine how bored Augusto must be with this material, being a death metal drummer at heart. Smith's departure isn't necessarily felt much here (I haven't given In Waves many spins yet), but Augusto is a decent fit if only because he can coast by the seat of his drum throne without even breaking a sweat. I will concede that the production values have taken a step up, even if it should be expected. Draiman clearly has a decent talent in the field and should continue down this path instead of wasting his time with the meandering Device project. \n\nWhether or not the risks associated with Vengeance Falls worked for the band is yet to be seen, but I consider myself a committed enough fan of Trivium to wish that they would just make up their damn minds. Either go back to the Ascendancy style or just finish selling the fuck out. You can't please everybody, but Vengeance Falls pleases no one. Download \"Through Blood and Dirt and Bone\" and feed the rest to the fishes.\n",
        "\nAscendancy and yours truly have a pretty storied history together. The background information is a necessary evil required to explicate why I of all people feel the need to defend Trivium's exceptionally loathed sophomore release - to a point. Imagine a younger me nearly ten years ago, balls-deep in Children of Bodom and Norther. A chance encounter with \"Pillar of Serpents\" at a college party of all things inspired me to track down Ascendancy once it was released to the expected fanfare. Being much less sullen and spiteful than I am today (even though I would never win a kvltularity contest), I was a bit more open to the album's devious hooks and easy on the ears harshness. Despite gravitating towards heavier realms of auditory splendor, this one always somehow found it's way into my car's CD player.\n\nTo address the elephant in the room immediately, Heafy's harsh roars are inert as can be. He has a strange proclivity of enunciating the \"e\" in many of the words, and it only amplifies the shortcomings in his approach. The screaming has that dessicated, dry quality that is normally associated with Petri Lindroos. It is loud, exhaled, and would be a fatal flaw if not for the cleans. Cleans that show a decent amount of potential and are silky and saccharine in their delivery. On a purely technical level, Heafy tries to squeeze past by faux-singing like Ron Rinehart did on Time Does Not Heal, but on the whole he is passable. The potency of each song is directly attributable to the level of angst in the vocal delivery. As such, \"Dying in Your Arms\" and \"Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr\" are both complete wastes of time and well deserving of the aforementioned scorn. Similar vocal flaws mar \"A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation\", which actually really picks up near the end; but it sure takes it's damn sweet time getting there.\n\nWhile the opener is functional enough, the first hint of quality comes in the form of \"Drowned and Torn Asunder\". Both this and the subsequent title track are more melancholic and darker than most of the material that bookends them. This gives the clean vocals more of an established foothold even if the riffs aren't quite as rancorous as elsewhere. In short, that's all you really need to know. Other than the fluke that is \"Suffocating Sight\", the rest of Ascendancy follows the established mainstream pattern of accentuating the singles and phoning it in elsewhere when the band can get away with it. \"The Deceived\" is interesting only in the fact that it is a castoff from the Ember to Inferno sessions. The verses groove along nicely, but it falls through the cracks in spite of it's stormy disposition. The two bonus tracks are complete throwbacks to the first album in function and form, and \"Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies\" is worth tracking down if you dig much of Ascendancy.\n\nWhile Beaulieu clearly holds thrash mainstays like Exodus and Overkill close to his heart, his delivery is strictly in the melodic metalcore vein akin to As I Lay Dying. His thick, meaty tone only accentuates the vapidity of many of these riffing passages. Even so, the trade-off solos between him and Heafy embody some of the most impressive isolated moments on the album. They aren't all amazing, but \"Light Light to the Flies\" is worth a passing glance for it's solo alone. Smith's performance on the drums is decent, but Sneap's ever-present hand in the production is likely responsible for most of the percussive appeal. Smith doesn't spend enough time on the top end of the kit, constantly pitter-pattering away with the double-bass and doing little else of marked concern. It can grow tiring quickly with little input from Gregoletto to help disperse the monotony. While Gregoletto is credited on Ascendancy, former bassist Brent Young actually appears in the video for \"Light Light to the Flies\". One of modern metal's greatest mysteries?\n\nI jest, but the common practice of dismissing material on principal as a sort of stylistic filter will always toss a few undeserved albums by the wayside. While it is naturally all subjective, Ascendancy has enough of a fire lit under it's ass to stand out from the crowd more often than not. It's hip, it's happening, and it's passable.\n",
        "\nEmber to Inferno was Trivium\u2019s first full-length album to see the light. Trivium is a well-known band today and has caused a lot of controversy among metal fans; you will hear good and bad things about them. So, when you look at Ember to Inferno, you have to think of it as three guys that wanted to play their own music but showing, as well, all the influences they had as the heavy metal fans they were. Where do I want to get with this? Some may say the music of this album can sound generic, flat, even empty. At this time, the band was still in his early days and looking for a sound of their own, so releasing an album with your own music but showing your influences isn\u2019t a bad start at all. Your band will progressively evolve and become more mature, and will eventually (or not) find the sound they were looking for.\n\n\nTalking about the music, the album goes for a metalcore sound, showing also a lot of influence from the Gothenburg scene on the guitar work. Throughout the album, I felt that I had already heard what those guys were playing, mainly because of what I said about the influences of the band. The songs are very lineal, as almost all of them follow the same structure, and sometimes I felt I was still listening to the same song when it had already finished, mostly because the band used some of the riffs more than once, giving the album a somewhat repetitive sensation.\n\nMatt Heafy\u2019s guitar work is the biggest highlight of the album. He shows that he can be a very capable guitar player, even more if we know that by that time he was around 16-17 years old. The guitar solos are well-laid and he has a good sense of melody at the time of playing his instrument, as most of the solos and guitar fills show a lot of neoclassical influences. \u2018Falling to Grey\u2019 is a very good example of this.\nHeafy is also in charge of the vocals. I\u2019m a BIG Trivium fan, but, sadly, his vocals here are very, very poor. He does a good job with the clean singing, but he can\u2019t growl properly, or do whatever that is. It seems like he still needed a lot of practice, because the harsh vocals lack strength and consistency. Overall, the singing is not bad, but Matt would eventually become better at it.\n\nThe bass and drums are there, doing what they have to do. On the one hand, we have the bass. It is very audible and has a few interesting lines all along the album, for example, the one that comes with the chorus of \u2018If I Could Collapse the Masses\u2019 or the chorus of \u2018Ember to Inferno\u2019 (maybe the most well-known song off this album). On the other hand, the drummer is very energetic. He is no virtuoso at all, his drumming is decent, but he employs very fast double bass kicking and he adds lots of speed to the songs on the album, making them feel more alive.\n\n\nOverall, Trivium\u2019s first album shows a quite talented band in his early days playing what they wanted to play with musicians that would later evolve and improve not only as that, but also as a band. A very good first step.\n",
        "\nI should start by saying that although I'm a huge Trivium fan, I suffer no delusions when it comes to the quality of their albums. So before I continue with this review, I'll reel off the negatives, such as they are. It would have been nice to have to have had lyrics in the booklet, especially for the killer Down From The Sky or the epic Shogun. Paolo's bass is virtually non-existent. Some of the tracks took me a lot - and I mean a LOT - of listens to fully appreciate, which may or may not be a bad thing. Finally, at times the riffs do seem somewhat borrowed/ repeated from other songs.\n\nThis being said, I am in no way negative about this album - far from it, I consider this to be Trivium's finest release to date. The biggest issue the album faces is not the quality of songs, it's Trivium's general controversy. Since their meteoric rise after Ascendancy, the band has polarized metal fans and left half singing their praises and half cursing their existence. Because of this, reviews tend to ignore the middle-ground and take the extremes. However, I believe that in this instance, an extremely positive score is warranted.\n\nWhat strikes me most is that each song has been crafted with purpose, not cobbled together in jamming sessions. Whether it's the Japanese percussion at the start of Kirisute Gomen, the soaring choruses of Throes of Perdition or the simple-yet-powerful riffs of Down From The Sky, every track blazes with a different hue. That's not to say everyone will like every song, but equally I think there's so much on offer in terms of variety that it would be hard not to be impressed simply by the creativity displayed by the quartet.\n\nHeafy's lyric-writing has once again run rings around contemporary metalcore bands - drawing on both Japanese and Ancient Greek mythology, as well references to the atomic bomb, the standard has clearly improved from the radio-friendly news-citing of The Crusade without slipping into the verbosity of Ascendancy. This being said, Heafy's vocabulary still shines through, marking the lyrics with his usual flair. This would be nothing, however, if the actual vocals were sub-par. Thankfully, this is not the case - the screams are back from their hiatus, and much more practiced than on Ascendancy. The clean vocals are equally magnificent; work has gone into making the more melodic sections sound less forced than on The Crusade, whilst simultaneously allowing for more biting tones if necessary. Possibly the best addition has to be the death-grunts and deeper growling, present more poignantly on Down From The Sky and two of the bonus tracks. These lend the darker riffs the killer edge they need, and ensure that those listening will be worked up into a frenzy.\n\nIn terms of the fretwork, Trivium have really matured. While Ascendancy has been applauded for it's uncompromising riffs and The Crusade was noted for its technicality-for-the-sake-of-technicality writing, Shogun delivers a far more balanced array of the heavy-hitting and the melodic. Solos are perfectly executed, harmonies are excellently orchestrated, and the whole album effortlessly shifts from soul-rendingly beautiful to chair-throwingly aggressive. The tremolo-picked intro to Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis belies the 7-string hammer-blow that follows, whilst Down From The Sky (as has been noted) is effective in its stripped-back simplicity. The title-track is the coup de grace, sending the album off with a little bit of everything - clean, heavy, melodic, epic, and what many consider to be perfect. This is the song that sums Trivium up; it may well be their magnum opus.\n\nA special note must be made for the bonus tracks on the Special Edition as well; the two originals, Upon the Shores and Poison, The Knife Or The Noose are among the finest tracks on the listing (begging the question why they were not included on the standard album), unleashing 7-string fury and riffs that feel as brutal as they do melodic, somehow bridging the gap deemed insurmountable by many; likewise, the cover of Iron Maiden's 'Iron Maiden' is fantastic, though perhaps not quite as polished as the Master of Puppets cover from the Ascendancy SE.\n\nBut the most important feature of this album is one too many people ignore, caught up as they are in the metalcore/thrash debate or the 'why are these guys popular?' controversy that plague the Orlando quartet. That's the passion. Metal isn't about having the highest production values or the most complicated solos. It isn't about writing songs that will win over everyone, and it certainly isn't about slagging people off for liking something or slagging them off if they don't. It's about the brotherhood, the unity of the pit, the throb of the beat, the skin-tearing essence of what you're listening to. This album is one that can show you that, and so much more. The lyrics and hooks on Throes of Perdition can make the heart sing; the breakdown of He Who Spawned The Furies causes even this normally zen metalhead to desire carnage and violence; the mastery of the title-track causes a feeling of awe few songs can hope to match as it swoops and cascades, judders and cuts it's way through 11 minutes of exemplary musicianship.\n\nThis is a band whose potential has only just been tapped into. If the critics will focus less on the band and the comparisons other people have made to thrash titans Metallica, and look harder at what this group has achieved in a relatively short amount of time, they'll find a wealth of creativity, a veritable ocean of talent and an unflinching attitude to criticism masking the future of metalcore - and of heavy metal as a whole.\n\nThis is an example of what ignoring what's popular, and making what you want to make instead, can create; an album that astounds and engages from start to end. An essential purchase\n",
        "\nThat is my first thought whenever I start listening to Trivium: \"Why?\" I ask myself why this band receives so much criticism from the average \"trve\" metalhead. Fact is, this one of the only \"metalcore\" bands (and I am hesitant to even apply that term to them) that I still consider good to this day.\n\nI am hesitant to apply the term \"metalcore\" to this band because they honestly seem more like heavy metal or thrash metal with the majority of vocals growled. There's no mind-numbing breakdowns and no insipid emo screaming. What there is, however, is a plethora of excellent guitar work. This shows up the greatest in guitar leads, which add perfect harmony to their songs (see: the chorus of \"Drowned and Torn Asunder\" and the leads after the chorus in \"A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation,\" among others). These leads typically pop up and add a lot of delicious melodies to choruses in the album.\n\nIn fact, I think that is what makes Ascendancy the album it is: the plentiful well of melodies, and it's not just the guitar leads. Every single chorus in this album is catchy, but without being generic or \"poppy.\" The vocal lines are well done and consistently make me want to sing along with them. In truth, these guys have a knack for forging addictive, catchy choruses (something I believe they manage in each of their albums); without them, they'd lose an enormous fraction of their charm. Of course, these choruses are dominated by Matt's vocals, which may have been at their peak here. Unlike latter albums where Matt adapted an abrasive, thrashy singing style, his singing here is the very foundation for the melodies that keep me coming back to this album.\n\nThough the album excels in guitar licks, the riffs are not bad either. They're never complicated, and they sometimes fall generic; overall, though, they're entertaining enough. From what I noticed (though this is not always the case), songs that deliver powerful leads seem to lack in clever riffing, whereas songs that lack leads have better riffs (\"Rain,\" \"Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr\"). \"Like Light to the Flies\" is the major exception; it has good guitar work all around and some of the best vocal lines in the album. As such, it is the major highlight. Ultimately, though, this album is dragged back considerably by the fact that some songs have great riffs, while others seem to exist entirely for the sake of the choruses.\n\nNonetheless, the good here (again, namely the melodies) works enough to drown out segments which are less worthwhile. With that, I see no reason for Trivium to receive the negative reception among the metal community they always do. This really isn't much like metalcore - and even if it is, this is almost the best metalcore one can possibly get. I still view their pinnacle to be Shogun, but this is only a few short steps backwards.\n",
        "\nTrivium is a band which has evolved and combined different styles, starting as a cool metalcore band they turned with time into trash and heavy metal and improving their style into something pretty cool, as a proof, 'Shogun' is a very solid medley of these 'metal elements'. It's a great album with pretty cool songs so... What's going on with 'In Waves'?\n\nFor Trivium's fifth album it isn't any surprise that is similar to 'Shogun'. There are so many pretty cool songs but also some others aren't as good as the others. 'Inception of the End', 'Dusk Dismantled' and 'Forsake Not the Dream' sound heavy with powerful drums and guitars, but also the tracks are kind of inconsistent and repetitive, even if those tracks were made to fill the album, they could have been better and the same happens with some bonus tracks like the teidous 'Shattering the Skies Above'.\n\nBut for most of the songs I have to say that they're impressive! The songs sound heavy and even if they are kind of depressive (a caracteristic for Trivium's songs) they're so fucking cool, with powerful drums, cool solos and awesome riffs. Just to say some of these songs we have 'Watch the World Burn' wich is strong and fluid, 'Built to Fall' is a proof of the right blance between a popular single and an awesome epic song. Even 'In Waves' is pretty cool despite being annoyingly repetitive and catching.\n\nEven if it isn't perfect and neither better than 'Shogun', 'In Waves' is a very cool album and it worths listening for. At times it can be kind of tedious if you're not used to Trivium's style or if you dislike it but it still being pretty cool.\n",
        "\nTrivium really built up a lot of hype when it came to their newest release In Waves. They started out as a aggressive metalcore band with lots of screaming, then for The Crusade, they went to a melodic thrash metal side completely. Shogun was like the mixture of both styles and really showcased their talent and where they stand at that point in their careers while reflecting everything they\u2019ve already done. They promised that In Waves will be their return to their roots in Ascendency and Ember To Inferno, and they were mostly right. I had a little doubt to this, as this is also their first album with their new drummer Nick Augusto (ex-Maruta), who was in a band with Paulo Gregoletto (bassist) before Trivium called Metal Militia.\n\nThey did not completely ditch the singing and bring back the rawness as I was under the impression that they would do. Not saying that I don\u2019t like it, I absolutely love both their styles. But I would be more comfortable by saying this album is a continuation of what Shogun was, as this album shows both sides equally like their previous album had done. The first song \u201cIn Waves\u201d starts off with a scream filled breakdown a\u2019la Ascendency, then heads into the melodic side of things that sounds like it was taken straight off of The Crusade. This song doesn\u2019t have the complicated riffs that fill just about every other Trivium song, other than the solo halfway through the song, and instead opt to make it simple yet catchy.\n\nThe true shredding begins with \u201cInception Of The End,\u201d which brings the energy that was promised and goes beyond that. The music is strictly metalcore, but the lyrics go back and forth between the epic singing and the awesome screams that made them famous in the first place. The drums are really put out more and Augusto really goes out of his way to provide more depth into the song instead of just being your everyday standard drummer that just keeps a song going. I feel that he will be establishing himself as a true force within the next few years.\n\nThe track \u201cWatch The World Burn\u201d is a track that shows Trivium branching out more beyond their usual sound of either metalcore or thrash. It\u2019s more of a progressive track overall with metalcore influences and a melodic thrash chorus line in my opinion. The build up into riffs, then a heavy prog bridge with epic vocals over the song, then thrash chorus, this track has it all.\n\nOne track that really brings me back to the good ol\u2019 days is \u201cA Skyline Severance.\u201d It is very reminiscent of the tracks \u201cAscendency\u201d and \u201cDrowned and Torn Asunder\u201d in terms of how the track is structured. It\u2019s got a soft yet heavy build up, before heading into the faster realm of music, then straight into the first verse. Matt Heafy (vocalist and lead guitarist) exhibits a deeper screaming that I haven\u2019t really heard before, but it\u2019s spread throughout the song. The guitar work on this song is one of Trivium\u2019s all time best, and the drums really stand out more than ever. They really speed up the song around the two minute eighteen second mark by working in tandem with the guitars and fueling each other, all before bringing out a solo, verse, then another truly epic solo that really stands among anything they\u2019ve ever done.\n\nThis album has shown the world that Trivium will never fade out of sight. Although I don\u2019t really think that In Waves fully brought them back to their roots like they\u2019ve been saying over the past few months, those moments are definitely there that have been missing since Ascendency. The song structuring for a few of the songs has shown a new side of Trivium, and they have refined the mixture of both their metalcore and melodic thrash metal sides into one cosmic entity. Another stand out track that I have saved as a flavor saver is \u201cCaustic Are the Ties That Bind.\u201d It\u2019s something entirely new and definitely worth checking out.\n\nThis is my message to Trivium: After hearing this album, I would absolutely love to see you all try your hand into the progressive metal genre. Maybe as an EP or something, but I have faith that it will show yet another epic side of Trivium that would bring in more new fans and not alienate the long time fans of your music.\n",
        "\nI have been listening (and loving) this album for far too long, and not written about it. There can be little doubt as to why Ascendancy is ranked as the 6th greatest album of the decade by Metal Hammer. Trivium hones into their niche, expanding on many ideas first presented in their debut \u201cEmber to Inferno\u201d, and the result is astonishingly good. I have been a fan of Trivium for almost 6 years now, and Ascendancy still never ceases to impress and energize. For some obscure reason, there are masses of ignorant listeners who hold the unjustified preconception that Trivium are a less than worthy band, and in the same league with the much popularised Avenged Sevenfold and Bullet For My Valentine. One good, honest listen of this album would completely shift this disposition. By my reckoning, Ascendancy is everything I hoped for and pretty damn close to perfection.\n\nEvery band member has an audible and obvious impact on the \u2018hugeness\u2019 of the album. The sheer amount of memorable riffs found within is incredible, drawing from a wide variety of musical influences. Harmonies reminiscent of Iron Maiden and Machine Head, the speed-picking of Metallica\u2019s first four releases, and even hints at black metal (evident in the title track); all combines with Trivium\u2019s own unique style with an astonishing result. The liveliness of a young band that has just \u2018found\u2019 their style is palpable throughout the album. Every song has its \u2018pump-up\u2019 moments, contrasted with generally slower and more melodic choruses, allowing the listener to experience the ferocity and aggression without tiring out or becoming disinterested. This juxtaposition creates the unusual theme and atmosphere that I associate with Ascendancy; dark, imposing and angry, yet blissfully enlightened and crystal clear. \n\nThe drum work in Ascendancy is a force to be reckoned with. Travis Smith out-does himself with a variety of complex patterns, perhaps most notably; his intermediate fills throughout the intro of Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr. Smith\u2019s extensive use of double kick throughout drives a multitude of songs into their crescendos (see The Deceived, Like Light to the Flies, Declaration, Departure, Ascendancy... what the hell, almost every song apart from the acoustic opener, The End of Everything). I have become aware of growing criticisms of Smith\u2019s drumming, and I cannot disagree more to these claims. I considered Smith as one of the leading drummers in the scene, and have yet to be blown away by his replacement, Nick Augusto.\n\nWith regard to the balance of the album, it is impeccable. Brutality and melody are perfectly matched to my tastes, especially with Matt Heafy\u2019s vocals (harsh for the most part, yet tastefully clean at select intervals). This is not the case with their later albums (most notably The Crusade and In Waves) which based greater emphasis on clean vocal passages. For a man that can scream and shout so harshly, Matt possesses significant talent as a clean vocalist (see Drowned and Torn Asunder; Dying in Your Arms). The production of Ascendancy is clear and projective of every minute detail, engulfing the listener in a veritable tidal wave of perfection. One final aspect that has my nod of approval, is the refreshing absence of any stereotypical, bland breakdowns that must make an entrance into every song in the case of some bands (Parkway Drive and Avenged Sevenfold, I\u2019m looking at you). Breakdowns do make a select few appearances throughout, however these are complimented by intricate lead guitar work, stimulating a great sense of originality and superior musicianship. \n\nIt is extremely rare to find an album where every song is legitimately brilliant. My list so far includes Symbolic and The Sound of Perseverance by Death; Fury of Our Maker\u2019s Hand and Last Kind Words by DevilDriver; Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for All by Metallica; and The Blackening by Machine Head. Ascendancy can be added to this list with no uncertainty; it is memorable in every sense. The only inhibiting reason why this masterpiece has not scored a perfect 100%, is that I believe that nothing can be truly flawless, but for the life of me, I cannot find a problem with Ascendancy. \n\nPersonal favourites: Ascendancy, Departure, Like Light to the Flies, Suffocating Sight, Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr.\n\nRecommended listening: Every song is an incredible listening experience.\n\nSpecific moments for non-believers: The snare roll and solo of Light Like to the Flies, the harmony and solo of Ascendancy, the intro of Pull Harder, the harmony and final riff of The Deceived, the solo of Suffocating Sight... to name a few.\n",
        "\nLet's get the negative out first. My only disappointment was that the booklet had no lyrics. But the art is amazing and some mysterious girl on the cartridge.\n\nThis album is the definitive album from Trivium. It's almost to mature for their sake! Aside from The Crusade hinting at the usage of 7-strings (\"This World can't Tear us Apart\" & \"The Crusade\"); this a solid release from the band itself. This album, though the cover may be deceiving, is not at all Japanese themed. Except for the first and last tracks, being \"Kirisute Gomen\" and \"Shogun.\" The rest is obviously Greek mythology spilled all over the Japanese slate.\n\nThe production in here is amazingly crisp and thick. The bass in track two is so loud and chunky! Paolo definitely gets a lot more attention in this album than the previous three records. The guitars have a flesh grinding tone that kicks you right out of your seat. With another string in play, things can get a little rough. With the seventh string being very active in this album, it's not over done at all. They keep the same \"Trivium\" formula without completely losing touch of the sound. The vocals, unlike The Crusade or Ember to Inferno, aren't tracked... as much as they should be. Tracks like \"Callisto\" or \"Prometheus\" have an appropriate amount of tracks. The only problem, when you'd see them live, some things couldn't be pulled off... such as vocals (but aren't too important).\n\nNOW THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THIS ALBUM......................\n\nUnfortunately, Travis Smith doesn't give listeners a big slap in the face with his drumming. It sounded more like Igor Cavalera took a chill pill. But then again, his footwork makes me shut up (Tracks: Insurrection. Scylla and Charybdis). His drumming from Ascendancy \"died out\" and couldn't make the ropes to Shogun. But he still makes a good groove (Throes of Perdition, Spawned Furies). \n\nIn a nutshell, this album isn't Trivium giving it's full punch, but it's a big original-full-on-metal masterpiece that should be preserved! I mean this is one hour of blood and whoop-ass! I fully recommend this album to any metalhead\n",
        "\nTrivium is most definitely a band that likes to change it's sound every album. While I liked Ember To Inferno and especially Ascendancy, I wasn't really happy with the change of sound on The Crusade. Where did the harsh vocals go? Why is Heafy trying to copy Hetfield? Along came Shogun, said to blend the style of Ascendancy and The Crusade. And indeed, harsh vocals were back, but they didn't feel as real as on Ascendancy, neither did I like the overall style still.\n\nNow, a couple of years later, Trivium releases In Waves. At first I had a hard time getting into this album, mainly due to the lack of inconsistency on this album. There were heavy songs, like Dusk Dismantled and Chaos Reigns, that reminded me of old day Trivium, but there were really soft songs on there too. It seemed to jump from one high to another, without making sense.\n\nBut after a while I managed to get into it and really appreciate the huge difference between all those songs. I strongly advice to listen to the Special Edition of the album, because otherwise you'll miss out on some really good songs. I'm speaking of Drowning In Slow Motion and A Grey So Dark, both - in my eyes - really good songs. Also, you'll miss out on a remastered version of Shattering The Skies Above and the acceptable Sepultura cover Slave New World.\n\nThe regular album though of course has enough great songs to keep things interesting. While writing this review, I was trying to make a list of 'best songs' of this album, but that was just plain impossible. This is really because of the inconsistency I mentioned before. Every song is so different and every song will have it's haters and lovers, it's good points and it's bad ones.\n\nFor example, In Waves kicks of with a breakdown, that serves as chorus to the song, and then evolves into a softer song. At first, it really doesn't seem to make sense, but it works. Then, next song Inception Of The End really sounds like Ascendancy-era Trivium, with Dusk Dismantled continuing this path, but even more furious. Next on, Watch The World Burn, one of the most catchy songs on the album, that completely caught me off guard after those two heavier songs.\n\nThis album will be love it or hate. I personally love most of it, but if I would have reviewed this album a couple of weeks ago, I would've hardly been able to give it a 65% instead of the present 82%.\n",
        "\nMe listening to metalcore? Thanks but no thanks. But wait a min... A Trivium spinning in me CD player, then? Yep. 'The Crusade' is different to older Trivium releases, if the writings I've read are true (never heard those two earlier albums). On this album, the band have turned down the 'core stuff and dragged in a substantial amount of thrash metal. About selling out: This album would sell loads more if it was metalcore.\n\nAlmost every review of this platter contains two names: Metallica and James Hetfield. Most of the time, the reviewers seem to hear no differencies with these two bands, which feels very unreasonable I think. Okay, there's some very Metallica-esque parts in some of the songs, plus Matthew Heafy (also guitar, Corey Beaulieu is his partner in crime) sounds nowadays a bit like Mr. Hetfield at times, but that's not the whole story. Generally, there's nothing that's already been heard on many a North American thrash metal record, and that's the band's biggest hurdle. But Trivium are loaded with youthful energy and can write a good tune, let me tell you. At first couple of listens, there's hooks that intrigue listener, but after ten spins the songs show their power: They fucking stick to brain and there's no way out of it! At times, Trivium gets more rocking, slightly reminding me of Death Angel (or it's bastard brother, The Organization, especially on 'The Rising'), and multiplied vocal tracks only strengthen that feeling, as actually does Hefty's voice every now and then. Rapid, Megadeth-style riffage is aired a lot, too. A shred-fest. Many tempo changes really animate the songs, making the album roll on like a freight train. Gotta mention the catchy, long instrumental title track and a nice \"balladish\" 'This World Can't Tear Us Apart'.\n\nPlayingwise this is accurate, but with live vibe. Thanks to the organic sound. 'Becoming the Dragon' includes a good bass solo by Paolo Gregoletto. Travis Smith throws in varying, driving beats. The cover art is ugly, harking back to the thrash metal cover art of 1980s. Inside, it's more like Mastodon or something like that. Lyrical topics include e.g. loathing, war, people killing because of their religious beliefs, and metal. Plus a love song, hehe. The lyrics are written pretty bluntly, but at times do find the point. Hefty's vocals are in vein of James Hetfield, but he also sing with clean voice and uses his screamo vox a few times.\n\nThe bottom line: Catchy, energetic melodic thrash metal album of the 21st century, that kicks dirt over many old beard thrash metal bands' later albums. However, there's nothing new introduced to the thrash metal genre. But I'm hooked to the album, there's fantastic songs, and that's what matters. Just tell me how many unique thrash albums have been released in 21st century anyways?! Okay, there you go, then...\n\n(originally reviewed for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2006)\n",
        "\nI never really got addicted to Trivium and thought it was a hyped band but they recently convinced me with an energizing and very intimate performance with Dream Theater. These guys really rocked the show and I happened to appreciate some of their songs. They didn't quite fit to the progressive metal heroes but as I am a rather open minded metal fan I accepted them and had some fun at the show. But on an album, it's a different world than on stage and the same problems I already detected before are still evident on the band's latest record.\n\nThis band has though a lot of potential. After a very atmospheric and well chosen intro called \"Capsizing The Sea\", Trivium kick off the title track of their new album and this song is easily the best one on the album. It mixes mall core screams with a catchy chorus, sharp thrash riffs and some memorable melodies as well as some atmospheric ingredients. \n\nThis mixture is perfect but instead of keeping the pace, Trivium get drowned back into exchangeable, faceless and mediocre modern metal tracks that fail to establish any kind of magic, atmosphere or emotion. I guess tracks like \"Dusk Dismantled\" or \"Forsake Not The Dream\" are simply not my cup of tea as I can't find anything interesting, addicting or original about them. It's just boring mall core to me with bashing verses and radio kitsch choruses. But there are also even more melodic and commercial tracks like \"Black\" or \"Watch The World Burn\" that remind me of bands such as Rise Against which I can't stand neither. Maybe I am already too old for this kind of trendy music which I don't really stand or understand.\n\nThere are still some great interludes such as the dark \"Leaving This World Behind\" or the bonus track \"Ensnare The Sun\" and also catchy tracks like the second single \"Bulit To Fall\" that could get some radio airplay and sounds a little bit like Godsmack. That's nothing original at all but pretty good radio rock and will help the band to get even more attention. Each time the band gets a little bit calmer and more progressive as in \"Of All These Yesterdays\", they are able to develop a slightly melancholic and addicting atmosphere but these highlights are too rare to raise the rating of the record up by much. \n\nIn the end, the album is worth to be tried out and contains a couple of catchy moments but it still doesn't justify the hype surrounding those new American metal sensations. Those who didn't like Trivium in the past won't change their mind by much with this effort. Those who have always adored the band may find that this new record is one of their most solid ones. I recognize and honour the band's live efforts and would like to see them again but they can't convince on a full length album yet and still have a long way to go to merit all the attention they already got.\n",
        "\nI will admit I am an unabashed Trivium fan. Well of their metalcore stuff anyways, for the most part The Crusade was just not my cup of tea. But still, I have been a fan since Ascendancy and barring TC, in my opinion they make some pretty aurally pleasing metalcore. \n\nWith In Waves the band seems like they are both experimenting and regressing. IW is in fact a mix of Ascendancy and Shogun with an experimental edge to it. Now I dont mean experimental in the avante garde prog kind of way. In Waves is quite melodic, probably even more so than any of their previous albums. \n\nSo where as Shogun had more singing than screaming this album does the opposite. Dont get me wrong there is still a lot of singing here but it was toned down a little bit more and the harsh vox were given a little more room. But luckily its not forced. And not one style dominates the album either. We have songs like Black and Of All These Yesterdays where there is mainly clean singing, while In Waves and A Skyline's Reverence with mainly harsh vocals. The rest of the songs run the gamut being anywhere in between. But I guess the main thing here is if you didnt like matt's voice on previous albums, you still wont like it here.\n\nOne thing I am glad for is that Nick Augusto took over on the drums. His drumming is a little more inventive and interesting than Travis Smith's. I mean Smith's drumming just became so...formulaic and boring. He got a little better with Shogun but Augusto's drumming here is all around better. The addition of blast beats into the songs also makes them feel heavier, probably heavier than they really are.\n\nAs always I enjoy the guitar riffs created by Heafy. For all the crap they get, Trivium have some of the better solos in the metalcore genre. They are technical to a degree but also seem to be written to add more to enjoyability to the song than just being able to say they are technical. They are actually a real joy to listen to. The thrash riffs are pretty much gone and the band is back to their Ascendancy era sound. \n\nIn Waves is a good listen if you are a fan of Trivium, or metalcore in general. The band has always been more metal than hardcore in my eyes anyways. It should appeal especially to those who just enjoy melodic metal. The only problem I really have with the album is that it could be a little shorter but that's not really too big of an issue since I still like hearing the songs. In Waves might not change people's minds about Trivium but it should be something fans can be happy about getting.\n\nOriginally written @ http://abaddonsmetalshop.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nTrivium are back! Three years since Shogun, they're back refreshed, revitalised and with a brand new drummer. And they most certainly are back with a vengeance.\n\nI've been a big fan of the Floridian quartet ever since Pull Harder On The Strings Of Your Martyr exploded onto the metal scene way back in 2005. At the time, my exposure to harder ends of metal had been quite limited and they opened my eyes to a new level of technicality and aggression, inspiring me to listen into their influences and discover a whole new world I'd previously neglected.\n\nWhile their Roadrunner debut was a modern masterpiece I felt that their following works, The Crusade and Shogun never really lived up to what they achieved with Ascendancy. Don't get me wrong, they are by no means bad albums, they're just not quite as good. For me, Trivium seemed to be in identity crisis, they were neither one thing nor the other. Neither album really flowed as well as Ascendancy did and it was a crying shame, because trust me, put the songs out live and they're all winners.\n\nWith In Waves though, things are different. Trivium have really found themselves. What we have here is a band who have written music at their own pace, in their own time, without the pressure of the label breathing down their necks to get something put out. There was three years between this record and the previous one, the longest gestation period of any album they have done (obviously there was also significant touring in between them) and it shows.\n\nThe songwriting is superb. Trivium have always had a knack of writing very lyrically interesting songs and In Waves is no exception. Songs of death, destruction, love, loss, heartbreak and devastation are all weaved through haunting melodies, aggressive posturing and guttural roaring. Matt Heafy (vocals, guitar) has pulled something special out of the bag. He's doing things with his voice that you would never expect. His trademark screaming has evolved to include proper death metal low end grows/roars while his clean work has a clarity and tone that surpasses anything he's ever done before. Caustic Are The Ties That Bind is a perfect showcase with him going from brutal screaming in the verses to a beautiful clean melody as the middle section builds up. Watch The World Burn and Built To Fall remind us that as well as punishingly heavy, Trivium can be as catchy as any pop band you'd care to mention. Both songs push forward anthemic choruses that drill into your mind and set up camp for the night. Built To Fall is starting to get some mainstream radio play over in the States and rightly so, its a brilliant song, hopefully it will get Trivium out there to even more fans.\n\nThe songwriting prowess has also encapsulated the musical arrangements with the boys trying out some new ideas, such as the title track featuring an ABA arrangement, looping a thundering one note riff with a melodic extending verse/chorus. Certainly not what I expected from Trivium but a welcome change from verse/chorus/verse/chorus/solo/chorus/end which seems to trap most modern metal bands these days.\n\nNew drummer boy Nick Augusto must be praised for his stellar work and could quite possibly be the keystone which has helped Trivium hit their stride. Nick introduces new ideas into the mix such as black metal style blast beats and breakneck double kick work. Bonus track on the special edition Shattering The Skies Above is the perfect showcase of Nick's skills. Previously coming from a grind core background has paid off as he has the chops to take Trivium into a thunderous new direction. Its also worth noting how well he locks in with Paolo Gregoletto's virtuoso bass playing. It's like the two were spawned from the furies at the same time.\n\nAnd I can't forget the guitar work. Simply put, its fucking amazing. Trivium have always been a technically impressive band but Matt and Corey Beaulieu have clearly been practicing for this album. The riffs, melodies and leads are a master-class in how-its-done. There's plenty of standout songs for it but for me Inception Of The End and Dusk Dismantled showcase the best playing the pair have laid down since Ascendancy. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that I'm reviewing the special edition of the CD and its probably one of the best value for money CD packages I've bought in a long time. Featuring well over an hour of solid metal is all well and good, but also packaging a DVD with an 8 song live set, a 40 minute documentary and the lead music video, well, it's just spoiling us. There's a lot of enjoyment to be had from the 18 tracks including a bloody heavy version of Sepultura's Slave New World.\n\nThis is one of the best albums so far in a year replete with big name releases (new Machine Head and Dream Theater albums are due out in the next month or so) and Trivium just keep proving how powerful and relevant a band they are. The next question is, can they follow this up with something even better? I surely hope so.\n",
        "\nTrivium is just one of those bands. From the beginning, they\u2019ve polarized opinions regardless of the direction they take. Some will love In Waves, some will hate it. This review is coming from a disenchanted Trivium fan. I say disenchanted because even though I liked their second album Ascendancy quite a bit when it came out, Trivium has not quite been growing as rapidly as my musical tastes, and therefore colors this album very differently for me.\n\nThis disenchantment mostly speaks to my criticism of the album. Trivium seems to be experimenting a bit on this album. With the explicit goal in mind to showcase their songwriting skills, they took the risk to try some new stuff. With risks like this come the consequences, as not all of their experiments worked. Most of the songs on this essentially metalcore album are caught between a sort of rock radio feel and a groove feel, and far too many of the songs sound the same. The tracks that stood out for me were the songs that broke free of this groovy rock radio mold. Songs like Caustic Are the Ties That Bind, sticking a bit closer to their thrashier elements, and Chaos Reigns, incorporating a couple different elements into the mix, managed to catch my ear. This has the unfortunate consequence of making the rest of the album sound rather flat in comparison. To me this felt like an album of mostly filler with a couple standout tracks that only serve to make it sound confused.\n\nThis, however, is not the only view on this album I possess. Though the standout tracks dwarf the rest of the album and make it sound confused, Trivium has shown me they can write good songs. Sure, they wrote maybe six or seven good songs and turned it into thirteen songs (eighteen if you bought the special edition like I did), but those six or seven songs were, as I said, good songs. This is a point in the right direction for Trivium. The band members previously mentioned that had former drummer Travis Smith stayed in the band, then they probably would have split up. The new influx of talent in Nick Augusto could be what\u2019s contributing to this enhanced writing ability. Whatever it is, I feel they should combine the positive elements of Shogun with the songwriting of In Waves. This could prove well on their next studio adventure.\n\nDo I actually like this album? Somewhat. Do I hate it? Far from. For me it\u2019s mostly at this point the fact that Trivium has spent far too long growing and maturing. In Waves is hopefully the last album from Trivium where we need to listen to Heafy\u2019s search for an independent musical identity. I sense he\u2019s getting close, and when he finds that I will most likely renew my interest in Trivium. For now, In Waves sits as an album on my playlist, not actively searched out, but not passed over when arrived at via shuffle.\n",
        "\nMedia invented conceptions tend to destroy any level of independent thought when experiencing music, so anyone wishing to call themselves a metalhead would do well to avoid it as much as possible. Nevertheless, sometimes the media hype gets so ridiculously overblown, so inflated, that even depressing, cynical guys like me who can\u2019t be bothered to use a car radio beyond its CD player function, or watch television beyond his DVD collection will be forced to take it into account when listening to something deemed metal by the so called mainstream. Nowhere is this more blatant than in the case of Trivium\u2019s infamous 2006 offering, \u201cThe Crusade\u201d.\n\nThe first wild misconception that needs to be dispensed with when approaching this album is the notion that this listens like a Metallica tribute album. There is a Hetfield tinge to Matt Heafy\u2019s vocal delivery that phases in and out whenever not utilizing that annoying clean vocal approach that reeks of bad emo music, but it isn\u2019t all that more overt than a number of 80s and early 90s thrash bands who generally escaped being called clones. But aside from that, when analyzing the overtly technical riffing, the frequent and wildly progressive lead breaks, and the somewhat oddly constructed song structure, a more accurate point of comparison would be Annihilator. There isn\u2019t so much a particular era of said Canadian thrashers to point to, but there is definitely a wildly similar blending of fill-happy riffs, sweeping solos, and older heavy metal tinged melodic material to safely remove this from anything that Metallica has ever put out.\n\nNaturally all of this doesn\u2019t speak to the actual quality of the output that is \u201cThe Crusade\u201d, which stands among one of the more hated releases under the metalcore banner in purer metal circles. This is pretty much where Heafy and company, like on previous studio ventures, tend to come up short. If one were to judge completely on technical merits, this album would be a formidable force, but as a collection of songs this generally leaves some things to be desired. While the riff work is fancy when the band attempts a thrash approach, most of these songs are littered with annoying breakdown sections that scream Machine Head, and a few of them actually do nothing but groove in the most annoying ways possible. Songs such as \u201cAnd Sadness Will Sear\u201d and \u201cThis World Can\u2019t Tear Us Apart\u201d just coast like a broken shopping cart through muddy swamps of down tuned groove, which is made doubly offensive by boyish sounding clean vocals and utterly uninteresting musical clich\u00e9s. Others such as \u201cThe Rising\u201d and \u201cAnthem (We Are The Fire)\u201d have some mildly enjoyable early metal influences that were pretty well done to death and much better so before 1987.\n\nThe basic situation that emerges here is that, when the band elects to sound like a technical, solo happy Bay Area band, they do a fairly decent job. The problem is, this only accounts for about half of the album, and absolutely none of these songs seem to be able to stick to a consistent sound. \u201cEntrance Of The Conflagration\u201d does a pretty solid job of sticking to a Jeff Waters approach of riffing, complete with all the brief neo-classical fills and blurring palm muted tremolo riffs, and Heafy\u2019s raspy shouts pretty well sound exactly what was heard on \u201cRefresh The Demon\u201d. The same general story unravels in \u201cIgnition\u201d and \u201cUnrepentant\u201d, although there is a bit more whiny clean vocals filtering in and out that degrade from the aggression factor established in the riff work and fast paced drumming. Beyond these 3 songs, the remaining songs on here tend to move further away from a consistent thrash formula into a hybrid of bad, tough guy hardcore and whiny emo with some thrash breaks. Probably the best example of this would be \u201cTo The Rats\u201d, which actually goes between sounding somewhat like Metallica\u2019s \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d and a really bad version of Killswitch Engage, all in under 4 minutes, oddly enough.\n\nIf one were to liken this album to its namesake, the best example would be the infamous 4th crusade where barbarian mercenaries, with the blessing of Rome no less, actually set out to fight the Islamic Ottoman Empire only to end up conquering a good chunk of Eastern Christendom in the name of Christianity. In other words, people who had no idea what they were doing essential ended up defeating their own purpose. The best way to look at \u201cThe Crusade\u201d is as attempting to play thrash metal in some sort of modern way by a group of people whose understanding of the genre can\u2019t really get them to their destination. That\u2019s not to say that this album is a complete throwaway, as I\u2019m sure many fans of Annihilator\u2019s post-Jon Comeau work of late should eat this up if they want to be consistent in their musical taste. But this isn\u2019t something that is going to win over many outside of Trivium\u2019s established audience, and that seems to be what they were going for here. \n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on July 21, 2010.\n",
        "\nGoddamn, perhaps you are familiar with Trivium. I'll be brief but the derivative metalcore-with elements of melodeath-and-big rock-choruses-band turned metalcore with blatant strip-mining of James Hetfield's riffs and singing style band turned (not even) half-way \"thrash\" band with big rock choruses and garbage metalcore vocals is back and gearing up for either a new album...or God of War video game. It's unclear. \n\nStill unsure as to what sub-genre they should be aping and attaching catchy choruses to, Trivium has opted to cash in on melodic death metal (again), if this single is indicative of their new direction. The harsh vocals are still there, with the addition of more \"death grunts\" and melodic minor scale riffs to a general up-tempo death/thrash beat. Don't get too excited; any chance of the song NOT being suitable for the soundtrack of \"Alien Vs. Predator\" is compromised with the stark imposition of Godsmack-esque, over-produced, layered rock and roll chorus. I'm all for triumphant choruses, make no mistake. When I'm making breakfast most days I found myself bellowing \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" in my bathrobe. No, this is a different story. Imagine listening to \"Hating Life\" by Grave and having all the momentum they've built up during the first few verses or so slamming the breaks on to superimpose a radio-friendly chorus. \n\nThat's the main issue with Trivium -- they willingly compromise any \"metalness\" in their music with inoffensive, over-produced, modern rock elements. Rather than putting out confrontational, tightly-executed songs, they half-ass those parts and make, let's see...Motorcross stunt video music. If you willingly choose the right hand path, mediocrity, you will receive as much credit as you deserve. \n\nIn summation: Tightly played but uninspiring melodeath riffs that were probably plagiarized from yet another metalcore band, weak metalcore screams and even weaker grunts, super hi-fi production, no audible bass presence, reasonably well executed drums, illogical song progression (as though different parts of different songs were glued together), and incredibly forgettable solos. I didn't even mention the breakdown in this song. Yuck.\n",
        "\nTrivium's Ascendancy was an outstanding representative of what metalcore genre was about. It had such energizing tracks as \"Rain\" or \"Like Light to the Flies\", but it gained mass media attention due to its softest single \"Dying in Your Arms\". Mass media called Trivium \"The Next Metallica\" (Which was apparently very praising for them, because Metallica was one of their greatest influences) and fans expected Ascendancy's successor to follow its glory.\n\nBut they received this as a response. The Crusade is Trivium's attempt to prove that they were the next Metallica by trying to be thrash metal. And that experiment brought nothing but musical failure. The first track \"Ignition\" is a strong reminiscent to Metallica's \"Of Wolf and Man\" and even though its chorus has some metalcore-ish melodical sound, it sounds awkward mostly because of the vocals. Heafy's vocals are no longer growls, but a failed attempt to imitate James Hetfield's 80s voice. When you realize that the second track \"Detonation\" reminds a lot of Metallica's \"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\", you can predict how the rest of the album is going to sound like: Metallica rip-offs with extremely forced vocals, forced rhythm and no emotion. The lyrics and the guitars on the other hand, are pretty cool. The solos are amazing and the lyrics deal with famous killings and social issues in a very clever way; Matt Heafy and Paolo Gregoletto really know how to write them. And at that point One would be asking \"If only those lyrics were put into a good song\"...\n\nThere are some songs in which the instruments are mind-blowing but the vocals ruin it. An example of this is \"Tread the Floods\" and \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\", a couple of songs that sound pretty addictive, energizing and uprising at the start, specially because of the guitar and drum work, until Heafy starts singing and ruins the song with his Hetfield-like attempt to sound thrashy. Another proof of this is that the only instrumental track of the album, The Crusade, is the best track of the album, with amazing and surprisingly original riffs and an amazing guitar work (The only thing that I didn't like was the tranquil part of the song, which sounded like an insolent rip off of Metallica's instrumental song tranquil parts like that of \"To Live is to Die\" and the song's ending, which is an insolent rip-off of \"Orion\"'s ending). And if you thought ripping off Metallica was bad enough, hear \"Anthem (We Are the Fire)\" when they try to do a Heavy Metal Anthem like Judas Priest, Manowar or Iron Maiden (And come up with an awful and childish result) or \"The World can't Tear us Apart\" when they rip off themselves. Yes, themselves, because it sounds almost exactly as Ascendancy's \"Dying in Your Arms\" a proof that they tried to do another mainstream hit, but failed because of their unoriginality.\n\nAs a result, this was a failed attempt to do a Thrash Album, mainly because of the vocals and the awkward intent to sound like Metallica's 5 first albums (Specially the Black Album). Thank God they corrected that by releasing Shogun, which was a pretty good album.\n\nSongs that are Actually good: Unrepentant, To The Rats, Entrance of the Conflagration, The Crusade (Best track of the album).\n\nFinal Score: 57/100\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve wanted to review something from Trivium for a long time now, but never got around to. I\u2019ve heard a few songs from them that were average, nothing really caught my attention. Anyways, so I\u2019ve finally gotten to these guys, and might as well review their newest album Shogun. But after listening to it, I just ask myself question. The main question I constantly ask myself over and over again is simply why are they so popular? \n\nTrivium is a simple band to understand, they\u2019re one part metalcore, one part thrash, and all together one giant gimmick. Trivium doesn\u2019t do anything creative; they just steal other (bad) ideas for their own. Pretty much the metalcore influences can be traced to Shadows Fall, and the thrash influences are mostly 80\u2019s rip-offs. Other than the influence, there are a lot of other reasons as to why this annoys me.\n\nThe main reason as to why this album annoys the hell out of me is strictly Matt Heafy. His vocals are so annoying I can\u2019t tolerate this guy, or any metalcore vocalist for that matter. He\u2019s your typical metalcore vocalist, every verse has you basic hardcore screaming, every chorus has the somewhat whiny clean vocals to show just how good of a singer he is. Then you got the back up singers to help project his weak voice. But seriously, how many metalcore bands are out there? How about on this site? There has got to be over 1,000 on Metal Archives alone right? Basically every metalcore vocalist sings just like this guy. Sure maybe they\u2019ll have an accent to sound different but they all sing the same in the end, nothing but hardcore screams and whiny clean choruses. \n\nTrivium is a band about copying other band ideas and pasting them as their own. A lot of people bash these guys for trying to be the next Metallica, and I can see why. Not so much with Shogun because this album is mostly modern United States melodeath, which is basically metalcore nowadays. But looking at their older material (Ember of Inferno) it is chopped full of half-assed Hetfield impressions and some Metallica riffs ranging from Master of Puppets to the Metallica S/T.\n\nIf you look at everything else in the album, like the production, it\u2019s very basic. Production is pretty clean; it focuses on the vocals, while the bass is inaudible. The drums got that somewhat wet sound to them like Linkin Park does. Even the actual structure of each song is basic; it\u2019s just verse chorus verse chorus stuff really. \n\nPersonally I\u2019m glad that they stuck with the melodic/thrash influences instead of going for a groove approach with the metalcore influences. The last thing we need from Trivium would be slower groove passages to reflect Lamb of God. But at the same time when you sound like Shadows Fall trying to imitate Metallica that\u2019s also annoying as hell.\n\nSo here I am at a dead-end trying to figure out what score I should give Shogun. Nothing about it is original. It\u2019s mostly rip-offs of Metallica, and Shadows Fall styled metalcore. The album isn\u2019t as bad as The Crusade. I would much rather listen to this than any other metalcore band out there, even if it is just for the Metallica rip-offs. The album itself is average when you look at metal in the media or metalcore for that matter (they all kind of sound alike you know). So I\u2019ll grade it on that, if this was actual thrash/melodic/whatever album it would fail greatly. Simply put, Shogun is just another metalcore album from a band that copies other ideas to make mediocre easy listening metal for listeners of the metalcore scene. Now that I think about it, I finally figured out why these guys are so popular\u2026\n",
        "\nHave you ever dealt with one of those albums that you wish you liked more, even if the general consensus concerning it is less than positive? Have you ever had one of those underdogs that you just keep rooting for in spite of let down expectations and just knowing that you really shouldn't do it? While Trivium seemed to reach their most consistent point (In my opinion) with 2008's \"Shogun,\" this 2006 effort is their most interesting album thanks to the drastic style changes and the circumstances of the time.\n\nStylistically, you could probably call this Trivium's \"sell-out\" record for it seems to address and act upon all of the crticisms that were directed towards the band after the release of \"Ascendancy\" the year before. The screaming is almost entirely gone, the song structures are a little more adventurous, the lyrics try going into less angsty territory, and the music seems to take more influence from classic thrash metal than hardcore and the Gothenburg sound. Unfortunately there are a few things that don't see much improvement and a few other things that seem to have gotten worse with the changes...\n\nOne thing that is immediately noticed when listening to this album is its weaker production and lacking energy in comparison to the previous album. Although it was produced by the same guy, the overall sound is a lot mudder than on previous efforts and seems to act against the band's energy as a result. The riffs and drumming are still pretty solid on a catchy/technical level but they catch fire less often due to a seeming lack of fire and aggression.\n\nAlso lacking in aggression are the vocals, which seem to be the biggest dividing point amongst the album's listeners. Personally, I'm still rather mixed on the issue. I'm definitely not a fan of the screaming and prefer them to stay in the background as often as possible, but the clean vocals are still rather bland and lack charisma for the most part. The latter part is especially made evident on tracks such as \"Anthem (We Are The Fire)\" where Heafy unsuccessfully tries to channel Bruce Dickinson at the single's climax...\n\nFortunately a few new songwriting approaches do help improve things on a structural basis. The songs sound nothing like those from the previous album and are also pretty easy to tell apart from each other while listening. Most songs like \"Unrepentant\" and \"Tread The Floods\" are executed in a fast paced \"pop thrash\" fashion, but a number of other styles manage to be repsented. You've got a few theatrical numbers (\"Ignition,\" \"Detonation\"), upbeat motivators (\"Anthem (We Are The Fire),\" \"The World Can't Tear Us Apart,\" \"The Rising\"), darker mid-tempo songs (\"And Sadness Will Sear,\" \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\"), and an instrumental title track. They even hint at the next album's style by means of the Japanese mythology-themed \"Becoming The Dragon.\"\n\nSpeaking of themes, the biggest problem that I have with this album are the lyrics. It's nice to see the band becoming even more socially conscious and covering a bigger variety of interesting topics, but they really seem to be going about it the wrong way. There is a serious lack of metaphor at hand and the lyrics often suffer from a lack of subtlty and poetic form. Just look at the main hook from \"Contempt Breeds Contamination,\" which describes the wrongfully racist shooting death of Adamou Diallo...\n\n\"The four protectors fired fourty-one shots\nHitting him nineteen times\nSearching the body, there were no weapons found\nHe lies with all who die in vain\"\n\n...And, tell me, how does that make you feel? Seriously, the purpose of writing about these kinds of events is to poetically or emotionally express your opinion and/or offer an interesting take on the circumstances, not to spout off some damn CNN statistics! It's like someone writing about a historical event by taking the words straight out of a history book! And throwing in vague phrases and random declarations does not make a song poetic or metaphorical (I'm looking at you, \"And Sadness Will Sear...\").\n\nOverall, the songwriting is decent enough for me to still enjoy this album, but I'm really not sure who I can recommend this to. The success of \"Death Magnetic\" in 2008 has rendered this album obsolete in terms of pandering to disgruntled Metallica lovers and the band's following in the metalcore circle hasn't exactly responded favorably. I suppose it's worth checking out for die-hard fans and others intriguied by the album's context...\n\nPros:\n1) Solid songwriting and decent variety\n2) The riffs and drumming are still pretty solid\n\nCons:\n1) The lyrics could've a lot better\n2) The vocals seem to lack charisma\n3) The muddy production results in restricted energy\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Ignition,\" \"Entrance To The Conflagration,\" \"Unrepentant,\" \"To The Rats,\" and \"Tread The Floods\"\n",
        "\nLike the vast majority of people on this site, I have a generally low tolerance for metalcore and other sub-genres of that nature. As much as I've tried to get a taste for bands like Killswitch Engage and Lamb Of God, I've never been able to get my head around the bland song structures and vocals that generally come off as annoying more often than brutal. However, this band has become one of my musical guilty pleasures thanks to their own instrumental skill and a certain Youtube user's hilariously crafter parody...\n\nIn terms of style and structure, the songs on this album are done in the run of the mill metalcore method. Almost every song starts off some kind of building introduction, the verses and pre-choruses are often fast paced and led by harsher vocals, the choruses are always performed with melodic clean vocals, and a breakdown of sorts often leads to a technical guitar solo section. Of course there are a few exceptions to the established rule. \"Dying In Your Arms\" is a ballad of sorts dominated by melodic vocals during the verses and screams during the chorus and the last two songs attempt to go into more complex territory. Ironically, the latter two songs end up becoming the album's weakest tracks due to a seeming lack of focus...\n\nThe lyrics are also rather typical of the genre and generally seem to focus on feelings of angst, anxiety, and anger with some occasional lapses into more political/social themes. There aren't too many brilliant lines on here, but there does seem to have a bit of effort put into the lyrics' construction. It's certainly not as pretentious as anything on their next two efforts...\n\nIn the face of all the album's generic moments and predictable structures, the band's energetic performance is what seems to keep this album from the forgotten realms of faceless mediocrity. Drummer Travis Smith's (Not to be confused with the artist of the same name) solid performance injects life into these otherwise pedestrian tunes and the guitar playing manages to keep things lively with the fairly technical riffs and solos. The production also serves in the band's favor and helps create a fiery atmosphere that would make even the dullest filler somewhat listenable. \n\nAll of this, of course, brings us to vocalist/guitarist Matt Heafy... I hate to say it, but Heafy's vocals really seem to keep this album from being as listenable as it could be. While his screams do often fit in with the songs at hand, they are also performed without true aggression and his clean voice is ultimately bland. Having said that, he can still carry at times and the clean singing merely hints at the Hetfield influence that would overtake his voice on the following effort...\n\nAll in all, this is one of the better metalcore albums that I've ever heard though it's far from attaining a classic status. In fact, this isn't really even their best album. Personally, I'd recommend \"The Crusade\" to more melodically mindful metalheads and \"Shogun\" to those who wish to see these aspects of the band displayed with more interesting results...\n\nPros:\n1) Energetic drums and guitar playing\n2) Great production\n3) Even the fillers are relatively memorable\n\nCons:\n1) The vocals could've been a lot better\n2) Repetitive song structures\n3) Slightly generic lyrics\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Rain,\" \"Pull Harder On The Strings On Your Martyr,\" \"A Gunshot To The Head Of Trepidation,\" \"Dying In Your Arms,\" and \"Suffocating Sight\"\n",
        "\nOnce again, we find everyone\u2019s favorite whipping boys in the middle of another identity crisis. Fortunately, this one is nowhere near as shocking as the jump between \"Ascendancy\" and \"The Crusade\"...\n\nOn this album, we are treated to a sound that could be best described as a cross between the two previously mentioned albums. The screaming vocals and harsh/soft contrasts that made up the bulk of \"Ascendancy\" have been brought back while the muddy production and melodic vocals/guitar riffs found on \"The Crusade\" remain intact. The album itself is also made distinct by means of more technical instrumental and some of the most pretentious lyrics that guitarist/vocalist Matt Heafy has written to date.\n\nLike \"Ascendancy\" before it, most of the songs seem to have pretty similar structures. They typically make up of aggressive introductions and screamed verses, cleanly sung choruses, and heavy breakdowns that typically lead to more technical solos. Of course, there are a few exceptions with songs that reverse the formula with clean verses and screamed choruses.\n\nThankfully, there are a few exceptions to this rule. The opener \"Kirisute Gomen\" packs in a powerfully building introduction, fast paced verses and pre-choruses, and a fairly uplifting chorus. \"Insurrection,\" \"The Calamity,\" and \"Of Prometheus and the Crucifix\" sound like they could\u2019ve been taken from \"The Crusade\" with consistently melodic vocals and thrashy guitar playing. I must say that I was also rather surprised by the album\u2019s title track. I was expecting it to be an epic fail when taking the twelve minute song length into consideration, but it manages to stay interesting all the way through. The verses feature some sludgy guitar work and solid vocal contrasts, the chorus is the expected sing-a-long like the ones before it, and the song\u2019s climax features what may be Heafy\u2019s most powerful vocal performance to date. Maybe people would like him more if he sang like this more often...\n\nJust as the band\u2019s musical aesthetics have been reworked, the lyric ideas have also been changed for this effort. While there are a few songs that focus on the personal/political themes of the band\u2019s past (\"Throes of Perdition,\" \"Down From the Sky,\" etc), most of the songs take on a more epic atmosphere with themes based upon Japanese shoguns (\"Kirisute Gomen,\" the title track) and Greek mythology (\"Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis,\" \"He Who Spawned the Furies,\" \"Of Prometheus and the Crucifix,\" \"Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven\"). Given my extensive study of Greek mythology, I found the lattermost theme to be quite intriguing. Of course, it\u2019s also the easiest theme to screw up and the song titles and phrases do get rather awkward on occasion. I\u2019m pretty sure \"Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven\" is the most ridiculous song title that the band has ever come up with...\n\nIt may not have as many hits as the previous albums, but this may be the band\u2019s most consistent effort to date.\n\nPros:\n1) Catchy songwriting and a few surprises thrown in the mix\n2) Interesting lyrical themes\n3) The band remains technical and talented\n\nCons:\n1) Awkward song titles and occasionally pretentious lyrical phrases\n2) Heafy\u2019s vocals are still an extremely acquired taste\n3) For the most part, the song structures are similar to one another\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Kirisute Gomen,\" \"Throes of Perdition,\" \"Insurrection,\" \"He Who Spawned the Furies,\" and \"Shogun\"\n",
        "\n\"Really? What'd he say?\" \"I don't know, he was going on about how the fans aren't all that smart and maybe following your own path is wiser or something, then he hung up fast. I don't know, let's just finish this already.\"\n\nA while back, I had considered Trivium to be one of my favorite bands. Their breakthrough release, Ascendancy, was the type of album to leave me completely floored for a year straight, and their highly underrated follow-up, The Crusade, repeated the flooring process with much more force and a longer duration than before. While Ascendancy was a great communion with metalcore and thrash metal, The Crusade was something of a half-complete departure from their -core roots, what with its straightforward movement and near lack of overly melodic vocals/melodies. Hell, the breakdowns on The Crusade actually seemed like opportune tempo changes and not just jerky stumbling in the writing process. At first, I had come to dislike this change in music. After all, everything I had loved about the previous release had been discarded in favor of a more edgy style closer to older thrash bands. But as time wore on, and the CD gained more revolutions, it dawned on me that the near abandonment of the metalcore influence was a smart decision in the long run, as it provided more solid and heartfelt music for personal enjoyment. Sure, the song formats were almost all the same, and the lyrics had suffered a huge blow (Not as verbosely overblown as in Ascendancy, but there are more creative ways to describe atrocities and the end of mankind.), but the overall tight feeling exceptional skill displayed in the music and compositions provided a more satisfying experience that can still be felt years afterwards, something I can't feel anymore for Ascendancy. All in all, it felt like The Crusade is what Trivium truly wished to create.\n\nThen Shogun was released.\n\nAnd I personally believe that Trivium should have just stuck to 80's thrash worship. Granted, everyone is entitled to flaunt their own unique qualities, but sometimes, you must question whether said qualities are actually better than certain others. I had read that their move to reinstate metalcore into their writing process was a conscious one, that the band themselves had decided to use this once more, but I personally believe it was fan-based pressure that swayed their decision into metalcore territory. Why make such an assumption? Do you realize that the number in favor of Ascendancy is higher than for the Crusade, and that those with the former view the latter as a half-hearted failed attempt at a thrash revival? I'm not stating this to sway your own opinion regarding the releases, I'm just stating a few observations I've made along this musical progression.\n\nBut I digress. Shogun was released and eventually purchased.\n\nBeginning with the acoustic melody you will hear later in the title track, Kirisute Gomen soon hits you hard with intense tribal percussion, soon followed by a rather 'corey' guitar melody that, strangely enough, work to set the mood for the rest of the song, as it's both intense and mystifying simultaneously. Then Matt kicks in with his thrash-like vocals to round out the melodies, and after a few lines, his screams come into play to add to the change in riffs with satisfactory results -- the song flows through its motions quite nicely, and the notion that a half-thrash, half-metalcore band such as Trivium may actually know what they're doing enters the mind.\n\nThen the chorus hits. And you're treated to an incredibly silly and weak breakdown that'll prevent the chance that anyone wanted to give them from reaching them. The bridge is not much better -- at least Corey and Matt's solos are amusing -- and after the brief return to their successful musical mixture, they jump right back into the idiotic chorus and end with it.\n\nI make a special mention of this song because this is how the rest of the album feels. You're going to experience moments of musical greatness mixed in very badly with moments of musical gaucheness. Some of the better tracks would include the following track as it feels like each musician is attempting to insert his own creative input into the song and the change in time is actually welcome as it doesn't sound like a 'corey' breakdown; Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven sans chorus because the more evident thrash approach to the crunch is welcoming (and, to be honest, I like the overly melodic chorus myself); The Calamity if you don't mind just how good metalcore can be; and several other select parts. As it stands, Of Prometheus and the Crucifix is what is probably the best track on here as it is the most consistent -- the entire song rushes by in a melodic whirlwind of 'corey' riffs and lackluster imagery that at least sounds like a completely finished product, as opposed to the huge amount of hastily assembled ideas that are all over the album; this finished feeling suddenly raised my interest and, eventually, liking towards the song in spite of its metalcore influence.\n\nThe reason I can hardly name other high areas on Shogun, however, is that, in their attempt to make a concession to their older style, they have made a quite forgettable album as a consequence. I don't mean that it's complete tripe -- it's that, after many, many listens, there aren't too many parts that can be recalled easily. It's as if the album still needed a certain 'polish' that prevents it from really 'shining.' Throes of Perdition has an exceptionally weak chorus which brings down the rest of the song (as do several other tracks), Down from the Sky is not interesting in the least, He Who Spawned the Furies contains practically no energy at all, and the title track is just awful, a pointless, excruciatingly slow trudging through a thick marsh of bland melodies and unnecessary ideas that do not mesh together in the least. Christ, I could have done without that track -- I am not opposed to slow tracks at all, but when you have an album like this, that revels in its hurricane riffs and unique mixtures (Admit it.), if you're going to attempt to pull a Candlemass on your listeners, then you'd best to do it right. Separately, the sections of this song may work -- both slower sections give off the aural aura of misused potential, as they do contain enjoyable pieces such as the chorus melodies of Matt's vocals, the slow guitar solo at 5:45, and the sudden transition into speed at 7:50 (Sue me -- I like my Trivium fast. Besides, it's probably one of the audibly appropriate parts of the song, this abrupt 'breakup', if you will.), but much of the rest fails to provide a worthwhile experience as the other title tracks have done.\n\n(Fortunately, I had the insight to order the special edition of the CD, which comes with three extra tracks, and if you're going to order Shogun, I suggest you do the same, as the following songs are refreshing after the disappointment of the title track. While Poison, the Knife or the Noose is okay but forgettable enough, Upon the Shores is almost completely metalcore with the exception of the VERY low and pleasantly surprising growls during the pre-chorus and bridge, as they provide probably the only truly fresh element on this album, and as such, makes it one of my personal favorites on the album. The Iron Maiden cover is probably the heaviest thing you'll hear on this release, as it's a straight thrash cover of a great song and a MUCH better closer to the album. If you choose to purchase this version, add another fifteen percent to the score -- I do honestly believe that these three tracks alone do a great job of rounding out what is otherwise an underwhelming release.)\n\nWhy The Crusade received such mixed reviews and unfair comparisons to Metallica, I'll never know. (I personally cannot hear Metallica in Trivium, especially since Hetfield and co. released their own full-length earlier in the same month, and side-by-side comparison, or rather subsequent listening of one and the other, has yielded little in the way of results.) Their attempt at a more focused thrash outing with The Crusade seemed like a more suitable path for them to follow, as it seemed like the band had evolved far enough in their sound to ensure cohesion and security in their product. But with criticism comes possibly unconscious pressure (I'm assuming the fans weren't alone in their persecution.), and the sound had loosened up once again to provide a somewhat sloppy outing that does little to recapture the same spark that had been ignited with Ascendancy (and nearly gets redeemed by the extra three tracks, should you heed my advice.). While Shogun is not a terrible record, it does not meet the same caliber of its previous releases, and anyone still interested in purchasing this should approach with caution. Not so much caution as, say, Black Tide, but it would be wise to remember why it is that Trivium is regarded with contempt in certain circles.\n",
        "\nTrivium started in 2000 as a metalcore band. They released 'Ember to Inferno' in 2003, which was a straight metalcore album all the way. After they got signed to Roadrunner Records, shortly after releasing 'Ember to Inferno', they released 'Ascendancy' in 2005. This album was a lot more thrash influenced, but still didn't completely abandon the metalcore influences and playing style. It was well received and could possibly be described as Trivium's most popular and well known album. \n\nAfter tons of live shows and a lot of promotion by the label, they started working on 'The Crusade'. This album was released in 2007 and almost completely neglected any single metalcore influence that they had in the past. It was a thrash metal album, and was promoted as such by the label. Singer Matt Heafy decided that he would not scream live again, as it would be affecting his voice. This, off course, was a great disappointment to the fans, as the lead guitarist, Corey Beaulieu had taken the responsibility for the screaming. And he wasn't the best. In 2008 they began writing for their follow-up. \n\nAnd then there was 'Shogun'. The most recent Trivium album combines some of the thrashiness of 'The Crusade' with the metalcore heard on 'Ascendancy'. At first I was skeptical, as I didn't quite like 'The Crusade'. Come to think of it, I think a lot of people didn't quite like 'The Crusade'. It was so unlike Trivium. It sounded way too thrashy for the band that we knew off 'Ascendancy'. But enough of the small talk, let's talk about 'Shogun'! \n\nWhen I pressed play to hear the first track on the album ('Kirisute Gomen'), I expected to hear a gong, followed by taiko drums and some Japanese string instrument. I was proven wrong. What I got was an acoustic intro to one of the most amazing Trivium songs I've ever heard. The drums kicked in and I was amazed. Could it be...? Could it be that Trivium had gotten this much better? \n\nAnd yes, my assumption was right. Trivium really has evolved into a perfect mix of metalcore and thrash influences. Well, that description is actually a little short, as one can hear some black metal (Heafy is really into black metal), even some straight metalcore at times. Heafy has adapted a varied and dynamic vocal style, ranging from the screams off 'Ascendancy' to the melodic screaming that was heard on parts of 'The Crusade'. \n\nSo, the guitars. They have changed a lot. Where they were first omnipresent and prominent, they are now well mixed in with the drums and even the bass. The harmonizing that is so typical for Trivium's sound is still there, but it sounds a lot more mature. Maybe it's because they have permanently switched to using 7 string guitars, which are tuned in B. \n\nThe riffs are varied, though alike in a way, which brings us to the first downside on this album. There are multiple songs which have the same high pitched intro, which makes them sound alike a lot. Then there are, on the other hand, certain songs that sound a lot alike in ways of pace and rhythm or pitching. How varied this album is, it's still repetitive in a way. Doesn't get on your nerves a lot though. \n\nThen there are the drums. Oh yes, the drums. They are perfect on this album. Where on 'The Crusade' the kick sound was a little muffed away and the snare was very loud, the drums are perfectly harmonized now. There is no ingredient sounding louder than the rest of the drums. Drummer Travis Smith has progressed in his natural style of playing, which isn't a bad thing. \n\nThe album is definately the best Trivium effort to date. It's dark though modern, it's heavy though melodic, it's probably best described as Heafy metal, just to avoid everyone getting pissed off at you for not naming the genre right...\n",
        "\nOkay, so it\u2019s not going to go down in history along with Ride the Lightning or Rust in Peace as a masterpiece of thrash, nor will it replace and of those albums in your collection. And yes, it is pretty unoriginal and Matt Heafy does sound like a sub-par James Hetfield, but you know what? There\u2019s a man who does an even worse Hetfield impression these days. His name is James Hetfield.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not here to defend Trivium with their big T shaped sword (which is actually part of a cool logo which wouldn\u2019t look out of place on a power metal album) because I think this sucks pretty hard at times as well, but the backlash against this band is a bit extreme. I remember first hearing something from this album. At the time all I knew of Trivium was a couple of songs from the Ascendency album that I thought were pretty good, but not brilliant. Then The Crusade came out, and you know what? I had no idea at all. I though Ascendancy WAS The Crusade (purely because I\u2019d never heard the name Ascendancy before and assumed The Crusade was the current Trivium album) and that this was still \u201cthe new Trivium album\u201d and in fairness, there was barely a year between the albums being released anyway. So when I heard someone going on about Trivium ripping of Metallica \u2013 particularly in the vocal department \u2013 I assumed it was coming from a total idiotic n00b whose idea of an exotic cocktail is a Screwdriver. Metallica sounding like Metalcore? Come on...\n\nAnd then one day I was bored and turned on Scuzz and saw the video for \u201cThe Rising\u201d, and needless to say I was surprised. This actually DID sound like Metallica and I couldn\u2019t believe it was the same band I\u2019d heard a couple of songs from until someone explained it to me. \u201cSo The Crusade is the new Trivium album that\u2019s just come out?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBut wasn\u2019t Ascendancy just last year and had lots of singles from it?\u201d \u201cYes it did.\u201d \u201cYet both albums are totally different styles?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nHmm. As someone who was just starting to get into thrash at the time (before I got into thrash I spend most of my time listening to power metal and black metal) I decided it might be worth picking it up. My first impressions of it weren\u2019t bad, but as I got more and more into thrash it became more and more clear to me that this was sub-standard.\n\nMy first problem is the riffs. They\u2019re certainly there, but that\u2019s it. Nothing that really jumps out and makes you want to thrash your head like you\u2019d get from a Megadeth album; they\u2019re just there, like a ceiling pattern. \u201cUnrepentant\u201d stands out though, because it is in fact the riff from Metallica\u2019s \u201cThrough the Never\u201d. Same with \u201cThe Anthem\u201d which famously rips off \u201cSkid o\u2019 My Teeth\u201d and as a previous review pointed out, has a chorus that could have come out of the \u201cDr. Feelgood\u201d album, only with worse lyrics.\n\nActually the lyrics are the next case in point. Not much to say about them actually, other than the fact that they\u2019re awful. Proof, you say? Sure, here\u2019s a couple of bits from the song \u201cTo The Rats\u201d:\n\n\u201cLet's go fuck \nFor every word \nTo try to breathe \nDon't fuck with this \n\nBreak every bone in your face \nIf you mess with my life \nI'll mess with your blood \nBury you in a coffin made of your \nA coffin made of your deceptions\u201d\n\nOkay...So is this song about having sex with a girl and then threatening to beat her up? And also, how do you mess with ones blood? Because I\u2019d rather like to try that one day. Still, the lyrics aren\u2019t all that bad. Actually, the lyrics to the title track are awesome.\n\nThe production is a bit annoying as well. It sounds like production from a pop rock album or a metalcore release like their previous work, which would be great if it were pop rock or metalcore, but thrash? Thrash is supposed to have gritty production, not the sort of production that would make My Chemical Romance give their thumbs up.\n\nActually, this isn\u2019t totally thrash. Traits of their metalcore past are still present in certain riffs and choruses, as well as in Matt Heafy\u2019s occasional harsh vocals.\n\nSo why not a lower score? Well the album is still pretty enjoyable, it\u2019s just not the thrash masterpiece the band would have you believe. And in fairness, the band are all clearly very capable musicians. The best songs on here would be \u201cIgnition\u201d and \u201cThe Rising\u201d. The former having the best riffs on the album \u2013 kinda like a watered down Megadeth \u2013 and the latter simply having a good feel to it and nice solos and cool verses, but the chorus is kinda weak.\n\nSo all in all, not a bad album. Don\u2019t go into this expecting to hear the next Peace Sells, because you won\u2019t. But it is better than some of the crap a lot of the bigger names of thrash have put out in recent years. St. Anger, anyone? This is enjoyable if you don\u2019t mind commercial sounding thrashy metal with lots of unoriginality and stolen riffs. Not great, but not total bollocks either.\n",
        "\nTrivium is a band that gets a lot of hate from a lot of metalheads, but do they deserve it? I really think that they don't and I'm not a fanboy at all. In fact, I don't really like Ember To Inferno and Ascendancy. I'm pretty sure that a lot of metalheads hate Trivium only because they used (yeah, they don't anymore) to play metalcore, because they aren't tr00 (that's what some people say) or for another reason that has nothing to do with the quality of their music. Actually, I used to think like that too, but one day I decided to stop being so close minded, I listened to The Crusade and I liked it a lot. I've seen a lot of ridiculously negative reviews for this album and honestly, I really don't understand them because Shogun is very far from bad! My guess is that some of them wanted to hate it. \n\nA lot of people consider Shogun to be a mix of Ascendancy and The Crusade and they're right in a way. It's thrashy and \"melodic\" like The Crusade and it has the screaming of Ascendancy, but it's different overall. It's more melodic (The Crusade was more thrashy than melodic), more epic, more progressive, it doesn't sound as mainstream (By the way, Down From The Sky is the most mainstream sounding song on the album and it's the weakest one too) and it doesn't really sound like Metallica at all. I couldn't really give it a specific metal genre because it's quite unique (atleast to me) and it's a mix of a lot of things. Sometimes it's heavy, sometimes it's thrashy, sometimes it's progressive (ala Dream Theater), sometimes it's melodic (ala Iron Maiden), sometimes it's catchy and sometimes it's epic, but I can say that it's not metalcore. Some people say that it's metalcore, but they must've heard a different album or maybe they're simply Trivium haters because there's nothing metalcore about this album except the screaming, but it's not even THAT metalcore (it sometimes reminds of bands like Dark Tranquillity). \n\nAnyway, the guitar playing on this album is very good! Matt and Corey are GREAT guitarists, hell, maybe even more than great. The album is filled with great technical riffs (the riff at 8:24 in the title track is a good example of that) and awesome solos that probably require a lot of skills to play, but I have to say that a few (only a few) riffs are quite generic. The bass, well, I can't say much about it because it's nothing special really, but I have to say that there's a really nice (and dark) bass \"solo\" in Torn Between Scylla And Charibdis. Talking about Torn Between Scylla And Charibdis, it's probably the best song on the album, it's filled with great riffs and solos, it's quite epic in parts and it's very catchy. The drumming is awesome, I don't know much about drumming, but I love the drumming on this album, it sounds quite technical. The vocals aren't great, I mean, they're nothing special, but they're very far from bad. Matt Heafy still sounds like young James Hetfield, but I think that his completely clean voice got much better. Like I said earlier, there's some screaming, but not THAT much. Every song has like 2 or 3 screaming parts and all of the rest is like on The Crusade. \n\nAbout the songs, there's no bad song on this album, some are good, some are great and some are awesome. Into The Mouth Of Hell We March is almost as good as TBSAC! It's very melodic, it has a lot of harmonized melodies that remind of Maiden (the part at 2:29 reminds a bit of a part from Hallowed Be Thy Name for example), the verses are great and the choruses (especially the first one) are very catchy. Kirisute Gomen is one of the best songs on the album, it's thrashy ala Ignition (from The Crusade), it has a very memorable chorus and the part at 1:50 is just awesome! It's the perfect opener because it really represents the whole sound of the album. Throes Of Perdition is very nice, it has a great heavy main riff that reminds a bit of the main riff from Dream Theater's Panic Attack and it has a catchy chorus that is pretty radio friendly (it's probably the most mainstream sounding part on the whole album), but it's good anyway. The Calamity, He Who Spawned The Furies and Of Prometheus And The Crucifix are all great and have original and memorable choruses. I can't really pick a favorite one out of them. I didn't really like the title track at first, but now I love it! It's the progressive song of the album, it's very epic, it's very catchy and it has an awesome slow part that sounds like something that could have been written by Dream Theater, well, the whole song could have been written by Dream Theater! Ok, it's very far from a rip off, it doesn't sound like Dream Theater THAT much, but some of the riffs remind of them and overall it's almost as good as some of DT's epics. Insurrection is very thrashy, it would have fitted well on The Crusade, the verses are pure thrash and they're awesome! The chorus is catchy, but it's definitely not one of the best choruses on the album. Like Callisto To A Star In Heaven is the second weakest song on the album, but it's still a good song with some nice heavy parts. There's nothing else to add about it. Down From The Sky is the weakest one, it's not bad, but it's nothing special, it's quite generic and the chorus is nowhere near as memorable as the choruses from most of the other songs. The screamed part before the chorus is pretty nice though. \n\nI don't really care about the production, but a lot of people do, so I'll just say that it's perfect! You can hear everything perfectly and every instrument sounds great. I would add more if I knew anything about the production terms. \n\nAnyway, overall, it's not perfect, it has some unoriginal parts, but it's a GREAT album that grows on you with each listen and I highly recommend it! I'm SURE that if it wasn't a Trivium album, A LOT of metalheads would love it! Just put a sticker with another band's name on the cover and I can assure you that your tr00 metalhead friend will love it. Remove the sticker and he will suddenly hate it. Anyway, it seems that they (Trivium) get better and better, so personally, I can't wait for their next album, I expect something even better!\n",
        "\nTrivium, The band people love to hate, and for a good reason to. Shogun marks Triviums fourth full length album and there isn\u2019t much change in the Trivium camp. Matt Heafy has decided to bring the Japanese influence (which was featured in the likes of \u201cBecoming the Dragon\u201d from \u201cThe Crusade\u201d) into more focus on this album. After listening to \u201cBecoming the Dragon\u201d off their earlier album, this sounds like a bad idea.\n\nTrivium is still playing their brand of metal-core so if your going to check this out be warned that this is nothing new. As many of you should know they have indeed brought back the screaming and fans all over the world are creaming themselves in excitement, but was the so called \u201charsh\u201d vocals any good in the first place? The answer is a big no. I am not sure who does the screaming anymore whether it\u2019s Matt or Corey or both, but whoever it is should stop right now. The screaming is extremely bad. It honestly hurts my ear to listen to. The Crusade was no means a good album but was a breath of fresh air as it wasn\u2019t plagued by constant screaming. The fans demanded the \u201charsh\u201d vocals back (although Heafy stated in early interviews that he has never liked screaming and didn\u2019t want it in Trivium) and low and behold there here in this album and sound exactly the same as in their other albums. Oh but the fans wanted it back so I guess they had to didn\u2019t they? I\u2019ll say it now that I am a death metal fan and I like harsh vocals so its not that I am biased towards those type of vocals but Triviums style is extremely crap and poorly executed.\n\nWell onto the music. Matt and co. are extremely talented musicians which is my main problem. Why do they waste there talent and play this weak form of metal? They could do so much with there skills but they don\u2019t seem to want to do anything else except rehash the same ideas. This album is plagued with weak and uninspired riffs. Yes there is an good amount of technicality in them but that cannot save them. Sure if you listen close enough there is some good ideas floating around like in the song \u201cInsurrection\u201d there are a couple of riffs that I actually kind of like, but as with every song on this album there is either a riff straight after that is complete shit or a chorus. If you\u2019ve heard Trivium before you will know that their choruses aren\u2019t that good but on this album they are so unbelievably pathetic. Every single chorus on this album shit. I\u2019m a man who likes his choruses and this band offers nothing good at all. They\u2019re either typical \u201ccatchy\u201d choruses that are honestly not catchy at all or you\u2019ll get a chorus that does not, in any way shape of form, fit with the song an destroys any chance of a song being decent. Take \u201cKirisute Gomen\u201d for example. It\u2019s not the best song in the world but it has some decent moments. When the chorus comes in though there is a complete change of pace and sound. It honestly doesn\u2019t fit and if you\u2019ve heard the song already you\u2019ll know what I mean. It happens a second time at the end of the song also. It has a silent gap making you think the song is finished then a drum fill brings the chorus back in. It makes me cry as this song could have been half decent. The rest of the songs on this album just follow the same idea that \u201cKirisute Gomen\u201d has set.\n\nThe lyrics on this album are appalling. If you want to get a laugh out of this album though read the lyrics. Here some example of how bad Trivium are at writing lyrics. \u201cInto the Mouth of Hell\u201d features classic lyrics like \"dear god the fucking ship is sinking\", \"life is hard, a fucking battle\" and \u201cKirisute Gomens\u201d \"with all the blood making a flood\". This is only a few shots at the lyrical abilities that Trivium posses. Hearing these lyrics destroys this album even more and completely kills any chance of any song being good.\n\nI\u2019ve tried my hardest to like this album but I just can\u2019t bring myself to say it is alright (never mind good). Of course on its release this will be snapped up by all the kids claiming to be metal heads nowadays and it will probably hit the number one spot in the charts. Everyone from the local Emo to Metal Hammer and Kerrang will be claiming it as the greatest album ever and just as good as \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d or whatever other bullshit they think is amazing. But as long as I don\u2019t have to hear this album again I don\u2019t care what they say.\n",
        "\nTrivium\u2019s success is one of metal\u2019s great unfathomable mysteries. The band wears its influences on its sleeve, calls it homage or paying tribute and goes about making some of the most consistently weak metal that I\u2019ve heard. Unfortunately, lots of people love the band and the end of September will see the band release its fourth album, Shogun.\n\nLet\u2019s set aside the sheer injustice of that for now and focus on this new album. Opening with a slow burning melodic guitar riff that actually made me sit up and pay attention, opening song Kirisute Gomen actually shows some promise for all of thirty seconds before the band decide that being creative and original is simply not for them and dive headlong into clich\u00e9. Kirisute Gomen basically sets the tone for the album with its carefully constructed patchwork of every currently popular metal clich\u00e9. There\u2019s the pedestrian thrash riff where Heafy manages to sound like Hetfield circa Master of Puppets (even more so on Insurrection), a metal-core part with Heafy doing the whole hoarse barking, a clean and incredibly dumb chorus and a Machine Head like heavy part. The band may as well have recorded the same damn song 10 times because there\u2019s nothing else on offer in Shogun. \n\nThe whole album just has a calculated feel to it. Like the band knows exactly what\u2019s popular and go about doing that in a manner that is devoid of all imagination. Every riff on this album sounds vaguely familiar and every song has a similar format. There\u2019s the thrash bit, there\u2019s the Gothenburg twin guitar wanking that seems inspired by mid-period In Flames, there\u2019s some very ordinary metal-core and maybe thanks to their part on the Black crusade tour, whole sections of songs that sound like Machine Head\u2019s The Blackening. Then there are the embarrassing power metal bits although most of it comes across like Europe circa Prisoners of Paradise (listen to the chorus on Into the Mouth of Hell We March). In fact most of the choruses on this album could have come off Europe and even Bon Jovi albums from the 80s. It\u2019s just as dumb and cheesy. I really don\u2019t see why Heafy has to growl over this music because it\u2019s not really that heavy and more often than not, Heafy just comes across as someone with a bad throat who should probably take some cough syrup and go to bed.\n\nThis review\u2019s getting too long for its own good but I can\u2019t stop just yet. This is the kind of music that boils my blood and just really annoys me. Here\u2019s a band that can obviously play, yet are content to dish out the most dumbed down, watered down metal that they can think of. This is metal made by morons for morons and I can only hope that the band\u2019s audience will grow up and realize they\u2019re being suckered. May not happen any time soon but there\u2019s always hope.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.kvltsite.com\n",
        "\nTo put it bluntly, no. Not new but slightly better than before.\n\nThe new album, Shogun, is a step up from Ascendancy, but equals The Crusade. It would seem that they have reached a plateau in their sound, now it is a plateau that isn't hard to reach, it is near the top of Mt. Sellout. Keep this in mind through out the review, I do not hate Trivium, I am not an elitist, nor am slamming a band that has just saw the fork in the road and chose the one to fame and money. The other fork would be to make good music that you believe in, like Dave Mustaine did.\n\nOn to the album. Shogun has a Japanese oriented cover and title. It appears that they have opted out of stealing from their traditional riff pool of Metallica, Megadeth, and Dream Theater. Those are the major three anyway. They focus now on the culture of Japan. I have no problem with this though, because they have to write about something, and this is a common thing to write about. I don't know where they got the riffs though, since in the time of the Shogun, \"Heafy Metal\" (see footnote 1) wasn't real popular. Anyway this album isn't all bad, just average. Trivium is a band that says, look at us we can play instruments.\n\nNow for the breakdown:\n\nThe Good - Like any other metalcore (I don't care what the band says, they are metalcore) they have some catchy riffs and vocal parts from time to time. This is true for all the songs. So about 1/3 of each song is good.\n\nThe Bad - Also like bands of the -core genres, Trivium feels that it is necessary that have a melodic vocal followed immediately by a growl. They also fill the songs with pointless stuff that lengthens the albums too much. I think that an over an hour is too much when you are not telling a story from the beginning to the end,\nsuch as Operation: Mindcrime by Queensryche. This album could use about 15 to 25 minutes shaved off of it to make it more bearable.\n\n\nFinal Ratings (out of 10):\nAlbum as a whole: 7.0\nVocals: 4.8 (The usual -core vocal format)\nGuitars: 7.5 (They show proficiency of the instrument through riffs)\nBass: 0.7 (Non-existent. Completely produced out of the band.)\nDrums: 5.3 (He has potential, but does not take the music in any real direction)\nProduction: 9.5 (True miracle with this band)\n\n\n\n\n1) ANationalAcrobat - \"Heafy metal\", Trivium's true genre.\n",
        "\nSeeing a huge change ongoing between the two previous Trivium albums, Ascendancy and The Crusade, I was very curious how Trivium was going to surprise us with their next album - entitled Shogun.\n\nIn advance of the album, which will be released on September 30th, three singles have been released, one of them being Down From The Sky. In the video, starting with talking about explosions and parts of what seem to be the news about ongoing wars, the video makes clear that, at least in this song, Trivium did not head into another lyrical direction. That doesn't matter, really, as I can enjoy some good political lyrics sometimes. \n\nThe intro of the song starts slowly with harmonized guitars and only few bass and drums. It slowly builds up on speed until the end, where it implodes into a nice riff, but nothing special really. In the first verse the type of clean vocals are heard that we still remember of the crusade, which had only few screams and grunts. I knew that Matthew K. Heafy(lead vocals, guitar) said that when he wanted to sing over some parts of the songs, it just didn't work. So this album will bring back some of the screaming and grunting we heard in Ascendancy. After hearing this song, I can do nothing but agree with him. The choice of grunting over some parts, such as the bridge and the prechorus was a good one, which makes this song really diverse. It has heavy parts, which can either have a mid tempo rythm, or even a bit slower, but heavy it is. But as heavy as those parts are, as melodic is the chorus. The two solos in this song are nice, but not extremely special, or instant classics, such as Wintersun's Beautiful Death was for me. \n\nSo, a bit that we know from The Crusade, a bit back to the days of Ascendancy, something good for every Trivium fan. Make me curious for the rest of the album this has, yes, it certainly has. Fifteen more days...\n",
        "\nFirstly, certain genres aren't for everyone, some claim metalcore is what \"good metal sounds like after it has sold out\", others claim it is the defining underground metal scene of a generation. To be objective among genres would be to make no sense, as the defining qualities of, say, power metal and metalcore are so different that they could never be compared well objectively. Thus music shouldn't be set aside solely because of it's genre, and thus it would be a logical fallacy to judge music solely based on the genre, for example saying \"Ascendancy is a bad album because it is metalcore.\" And usually this is done in a less blunt manner, but essentialy many people will and have said that it just sounds like all the other metalcore, but to be truly objective you must listen beyond the genre, to the technicality, energy, and emotion of music within the style (or if it breaks ground in music/metal altogether.) \n\nNow, onto this album specifically. \n\nMatt Heafy's vocals didn't change much from Ember to Inferno, they still maintain a good level of emotion, enough to maintain a good atmosphere within the music. The lyrics are a drawback to the album, because despite the above average delivery, the lyrics have highs and lows. At some points they will be very angst ridden and powerful, such as on the song \"Drowned and Torn Asunder\", yet at others they will seem very cliche', such as on the song \"Dying in your Arms.\" This is a bigger drawback to some more than others, but personally I believe that as long as lyrics aren't consistantly lacking emotion and lacking intelligence, than the music can be listenable (and deep, intelligent lyrics are just a rare bonus.) \n\nThe guitar work is fantastic throughout the entire album, it isn't a shredfest by any means, but it is delivered with such conviction and emotion, while at the same time maintaining technicality and not falling into any stereotypes of the genere. This just further adds to the great atmosphere this album gives, and the emotions it evokes. This guitar work is exhibited throughout the entire album, but to get a good idea of it I would listen to the song \"A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation.\" The bass, on the other hand, is generally hidden under the guitar, doing only what it needs to do and never pushing limits. Which isn't neccesarily bad, because it definately does not take away from the music, but there is not much to say about it besides that it just fits with the music. \n\nThe drums on this album are not overly-technical or overbearing which drums can tend to be when bad drummers try to overcompensate. But Travis Smith attempts a \"White Stripes\"'esque strategy on this album, by just playing drums that fit well with the music, he does what he needs to do to sound good and nothing more. This is a treat for those of us that are fed up with abnoxious drummers or those that only use standard double-bass riffs. Generally all of the instruments on this album synergize perfectley, and I attribute it most to this style of drumwork. \n\nThe first taste of this album you get (after the fairly dissapointing introduction) is \"Rain\" which is a very energetic song to kickstart the album, though I feel it is the one point on the album where musicianship is not exhibited as well as on the rest of album, especially on the guitar. But the last song, \"Declaration,\" is a definate highlight of this album and a great way to end the album, on good musicianship and excellent angstridden vocals with coherent lyrics to go along with the fantastic delivery. \n\n\"Ascendancy\" is a wholly entertaining album, perhaps sans the song \"Dying in your Arms\", but that is not a horrible song and is easily made up for by the proceeding song \"The Deceieved.\" So the album is not perfect, but it is very enjoyable and I think will be looked back on as a classic album of the metalcore genre. I would definately check it out if you are into the metalcore genre or are looking to explore other genres.\n",
        "\nWell here we are. Trivium's third album and fourth official release overall. The controversy surrounding this album is nearly impossible to ignore, but I will not touch on this. Everyone already knows what's hated and loved about this album, so describing it again would be a waste of time. In short, at this point, in 2006, Trivium already knew they had established themselves as a force to be reckoned with, showcasing nonstop touring, releasing new albums quite often, showing confidence and NO signs of slowing down. So, instead of rehash what they had done before, they thought they would go down the \"old school\" metal route, but with a modern flare and the still obvious metalcore moments and breakdowns (see Sanctity's Road To Bloodshed for similar results).\n\nOpener \"Ignition\" sets the stage for the rest of the album. The obvious attempts at thrash are noticable, as well as Heafy's new vocal style, but the riffing this time around is much more technical and much faster than before. The chorus on hand on this one is by far one of the best on the album, and the song moves at such a quick pace (those triplets in the prechorus are pretty quick, almost at Iced Earth standards) that it's over in less than 4 minutes. The next song \"Detonation\" starts out a bit more lurching and menacing, showing an obvious Master Of Puppets era Metallica on the first half of this one, before morphing into a Slayer-esque solo, then breaking down into a more melodic power metal style, with a dual Maiden harmony at the end. An OBVIOUS highlight. \"Entrance Of The Conflagration\", the first single/video from the album is next, and it continues the momentum set by the first two, with more fast thrash-y riffs and a technical breakdown with a nice solo. The second single \"Anthem (We Are The Fire)\" is a song that really must grow on you, as the verses are a bit \"anthemic, call to arms\" ready than most others here....this is not Trivium's style...that being said, the lead in the middle is pure gold, one of the highest solos on hand here. \"Unrepentant\" is pure speed metal, no more, no less, albiet with a melodic chorus and a slower solo shred section, while \"And Sadness Will Sear\" is a slow, somber tune, with lyrics detailing the death of someone at the hands of ignorance. A very sad tune. \"Becoming the Dragon\", the fifth and final single is next, and it changes the pace big time. It is much more upbeat this time around, with a prog-metal midsection breakdown that calls Nevermore to mind. \n\n\"To The Rats\" kicks off the second half, and on this one, it is balls out thrash, excluding the chorus, but \"This World Can't Tear Us Apart\" is much more melodic and radio friendly. This is the \"ballad\" of the album, but the fact it was written on a 7 string guitar is kind of oddball. \"Tread The Floods\" brings back more of the diminished palm muted riffs, with a nice lengthy solo in the middle that is quite technical. \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\", probably the most technical song on the album, has a very intense intro, and a prechorus that requires very nimble fingers to pull off, but the next song \"The Rising\" is a bit sleazy. It's more slow, radio oriented rock, and it's not a surprise this was chosen as their third single, though many other songs are better. The title track is extremely impressive, with it's many riff changes and amazing finger tapped section in the middle/end. By far the most progressive song on the album, very Dream Theater-ish. The swept arpeggios around the 6 minute mark are incredible to listen to. It may be the \"cool\" and \"in\" thing to play guitar great now, and it seems to piss a lot of elitists off, but why? The fact you can play this well should be praised, not hated.\n\nThere were two b-sides recorded for the album, titled \"Vengeance\" and \"Broken One\". Why they weren't put on the album is beyond me. \"Vengenace\" is a very heavy \"People of the Lie\"-esque number, while \"Broken One\" has a very melodic intro, and a couple of tempo shifts, and another chorus of great note.\n\nThis album wasn't as much of a leap forward as Ascendancy was, but creatively, it certainly was. Even still, there were MANY spots in which Trivium needs to grow. The lyrics, which were astounding on Ember to Inferno and above average on Ascendancy seemed a bit slapped together on this one, namely on \"To The Rats\", \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\", \"The Rising\" and \"Anthem\". The vocal melodies on many of the songs sound a bit similar as well. These qualms seem a bit damning, but this album is too damn good and creative for the time in which it was written/recorded (on the road, on short breaks). This shortcoming of time will be much less prevalent on their upcoming album \"Shogun\" to be released September 30th, so us Trivium fans continue to sit and wait with bated breath...\n",
        "\nAfter a year and a half of touring, getting signed to Roadrunner records, and recording a new album, Trivium finally re-emerged with an album that is hands down better than the previous album, Ember to Inferno. The riffs are beefier, the production is more wholly, and the two new band members (lead guitarist Corey Beaulieu who joined around the time Ember to Inferno was released, and bassist Paolo Gregoletto, who entered the fray when previous bassist Brent Young left for personal reasons) brought a whole new spark of energy and life to the band. Returning members, guitarist/vocalist Matt Heafy and drummer Travis Smith really stepped up their game on this one. The drumming is more technical, Heafy's songwriting has improved immensely since the last album, and his vocals are much more powerful and convincing than the very digital overdubbed vocals on Ember to Inferno.\n\nThings start off on a mellow note with \"The End of Everything\", a short piano/acoustic guitar intro with some choir vocals in the background, before \"Rain\" kicks in with a thrash metal riff, before morphing into a metalcore song with nice vocals, riffs and an emotional solo thrown in at the end, before ending with a breakdown riff. \"Pull Harder On The Strings Of Your Martyr\", the second single from the album, is one of the album's highlights, and a staple in the band's setlist as the song they usually end with. A technical drum intro, catchy riffs, a guest solo played by producer Jason Suecof, and a chorus to die for are what made this song a Trivium classic. \"Drowned And Torn Asunder\" continue the momentum, with a melodic intro leading into more speedy riffs, and a thrashy pre-chorus, with a very nice duel solo between Beaulieu and Heafy near the end. The title track is a truly beautiful number with some very creative riffs and great lyrics to boot. \"A Gunshot To The Head Of Trepidation\", the third from the album, boasts a duel guitar harmony in the middle that would make Iron Maiden proud, and some bouncy rhythms built for the mosh pit.\n\nThe second half of the album starts off with \"Like Light to the Flies\", Trivium's first ever commercial single. The solo is one of the highlights of the album, as is the melodic chorus. \"Dying In Your Arms\" is the power ballad of the album, and while some may label this as \"emo\", there are no emo bands that hold the power, songwriting ability and the musical dexterity to pull this kind of thing off. \"The Decieved\" brings back the speed, with more anthemic rhythms and a couple of extremely well lit solos, before \"Suffocating Sight\" brings a bit more darkness to the illuminated areas. \"Departure\" is another slower number, with acoustic guitars during the main verses and an emotion filled chorus, BUT...things get nice and thrashy during the middle of the song, with some technical riffs and a climaxing shred solo before the rhythm slows down again immensely. \"Declaration\" closes the main part of the album off with an intro that is truly astounding in it's arrangement, as well as a riff that reminds me of \"Cause For Conflict\" era Kreator, and a midsection that is in quite epic proportions. The outro is a breakdown riff that continues until it fades...a quite fitting outro to such a great album.\n\nMy version is the \"Special Edition\" re-released in 2006 on Roadrunner, and it includes four bonus tracks and a bonus dvd which includes the music videos from the album and live performances from one gig of the same songs they made videos for, oddly.\n\n\"Blinding Tears Will Break The Skies\" is nearly the same as the demo version recorded a year earlier, but a lot of the excess fat has been trimmed, in addition to better production and vocals, and \"Washing Away Me In The Tides\" has nothing that really seperates it from the others when listened to chronologically, but sounds amazing when listened to on its own. The cover of Metallica's \"Master Of Puppets\" is next and it sounds exactly the same as the original, albeit with E flat tuning. The full cd closes with the \"video mix\" of Dying In Your Arms, which includes a piano intro and no screamed vocals, but other than that, it's basically the same.\n\nThe dvd is kind of cool. The music videos are a nice touch, as is the live performance, but the performance is a bit lackluster. I don't really like the guitar tone used as it makes the beefy originals on the album sound weaker, and Heafy's vocals sound a bit forced...almost as if he's trying too hard to hit the notes, but ending up out of key anyways. Gregoletto's backup vocals sound horrible themselves...I found myself cringing while watching it, because it is not very pleasant to the ears. I know these guys can do better. I've seen them live and collect their bootlegs regularly, so I don't know why they'd include a performance that is so disheartening.\n\nAll in all, Ascendancy is one of the finest albums Trivium has released so far, even if a few songs do sound a bit similar, but if it isnt broken, why fix it? The sameness of the album and the obvious digital influence are what gives this a less than perfect rating to my ears. The band would change their style DRAMATICALLY for the next album to try and break themselves from the metalcore mold, and while it excels in some areas, it fails in others, though it seems finding their own style is something they have yet to do...\n",
        "\nFrom the lyrics to the title track of this album. Now, in all seriousness, the same sound derived from the EP/Demo is on hand here, with fast, semi-technical riffs, screamed verses, clean sung choruses and a solo in just about every song. There are some nice neo-classical guitar pieces wedged at the beginning, middle and end of the album to offer a change in pace, or perhaps to show the more slow, somber sides of the album.\n\nThe demo/EP got the band signed to Lifeforce records, and their first (and only) release under that label is this album here present. The same line up that performed on the EP are on hand here, with some guest musicians every once in a while helping with backup vocals, guest solos and additional guitar tracks. The newer songs sound fresher than the old rennovated songs from the EP, and their growth as songwriters seemed (was, and is) inevitable. Frontman/only guitarist at the time was still only 17 at the time of the recording/release of this album, so there still were many areas in which the band needed to grow. \n\nThe album opens with \"Inception - The Bleeding Skies\", which oddly enough, is the outro \"A View of Burning Empires\" played backwards. This leads into the fastest, heaviest song on the release, \"Pillars Of Serpents\" which sounds mighty similar to \"Disciple\" by Slayer, until a neo-classical riff kicks in and there's a nice clean vocal section with a helpless sounding solo. \"If I Could Collapse The Masses\" keeps up the speed, though it has many more slowdown sections than the previous track. \"Fugue (A Revelation)\" and \"Requiem\", reworked from the demo, sounds better here, as the solos are much different and the sound is much improved (I guess lots of rehearsal and playing live helped in this matter). The title track is next, and while it is probably the most well known on the album, I'm still not quite sure if it is the best. It does have all the ingredients that one can expect from Trivium, and probably the best chorus on the album. \n\n\"Ashes\" is next, and it is a short, slow classical guitar piece, which leads into \"To Burn The Eye\", another song reworked from the demo, but I think this version sounds less punchy than the demo version, and seems even more so to drag on. Definetely the lowlight of the album, but a bad song on here? Nope. \"Falling To Grey\" is next and for a change, it opens with a nice solo. This is probably the most underrated song on hand here, as it seems to offer much more emotion and dexterity than the others, but there's something about it that makes it less than classic. \"My Hatred\" the fourth, and final song reworked from the demo, is in much better shape than \"To Burn The Eye\" is, though it suffers from sounding nearly EXACTLY the same as the demo version. The last real track, \"When All Light Dies\" is by far one of the best in the Trivium cannon. It packs quite an emotional wallop, detailing the horrors of child abuse, and the music on hand fits the lyrical theme quite well, alternating between somber and upbeat, brutal and melodic. There is a breakdown in the middle that is quite raging, and the outro is probably the best part on the album, which leads into \"A View of Burning Empires\", which is the same melody as the outro to \"When All Light Dies\", but classical guitars, keyboards, acoustic guitars all come into play here.\n\nMy version comes with two of three demo tracks they cut in November 2003, tacked on at the end. \"Blinding Tears Will Break The Skies\" is a fast, heavy number, with a great chorus and \"The Decieved\" would later resurface on Ascendancy, though with a guitar sound that's not quite as mammoth as this one. They cut another demo during these sessions, for the song \"Like Light To The Flies\", but they didn't show up on this release for some reason. Odd.\nEventually, the 3 track demo they cut in November 2003, made its way into the ears of Monte Connor of Roadrunner Records, but that's the next part of the story...\n\nBut for the time, Ember to Inferno was an album that may not have been original, but it was creative, and the age of the band members must always be considered when listening to something of this kind of status. When it was released, Ember to Inferno was but a footnote in the metal scene, but it's popularity has grown as Trivium has recieved more exposure.\n",
        "\nTrivium. One of the most hated AND loved bands of the new millenium. The band who elitists hate because of their overly melodic tendencies and their constant comparison to Metallica, as well as evidence of similar riffs, but a band whom casual, younger metalheads enjoy for their hodgepodge of thrash, metalcore, progressive and power metal. A band that rose to greatness through hard work, dedication and songwriting that is far beyond the caliber of these guys' age. Frontman and only guitarist (at the time) Matt Heafy was only 16 at the time of the release of this EP/demo, and his riffwork and soloing on this piece are quite technical, to say the least. Even if one hates Trivium for their aspiration to be like other bands, they must be respected at least for their technical dexterity when it comes to riffing and soloing. Drummer Travis Smith makes himself heard well on this album, with his constant usage of the double bass pedal and fills that arent always technical, but always creative. Bassist Brent Young's contributions are few and far between. His basswork is audibly heard, due to Jason Suecof's superb production (you'd think this wasn't a demo at first listen), but he mainly follows the guitar and hardly makes a name for himself.\n\nOnto the songs themselves....Opener \"To Burn The Eye\" is one of two epics on this short album release. There is a breakdown in the middle and a great prechorus riff, though it tends to drag on a bit. \"Requiem\" has an intro riff that sounds massively similar to In Flames (Heafy was listening to a LOT of In Flames around the time of this release, so his influences are really worn on his sleeve on this track), and \"Fugue\" is a bit speedier than the last two, with a great melodic chorus and a fast fingered solo. \"My Hatred\" has a pretty technical pre-verse riff in the beginning, that is quite creative and mind boggling, but \"The Storm\" is the true peak of this EP. A neo-classical guitar intro that sounds massively similar to the midsection of \"Trust\" by Megadeth leads into a speedy riff section with ominous riffs, the best chorus on the album and a quite lengthy solo that sounds improvised, yet rehearsed. People who think Trivium write only catchy verse/chorus/verse/chorus songs, take a listen of this one. \"The Storm\" is a bit more power metall-ish than the rest of the EP, the only exception being the vocals. The solo in the middle is the peak of the fretwork on hand here, and you have to question how Heafy could pull something like this off at such a young age, and \"Demon\", one of the earliest Trivium songs, is by far their most ominous sounding ever, with some very Slayer-ish riffs inserted, but with Trivium's own flare on things.\n\nIn closing, this EP is overlooked most of the time. Sure, it isn't quite at the level of greatness they'd eventually succumb to, and at the time, they were basically an unsigned struggling local band, but the songs on hand here proved without a shadow of a doubt, that these guys would eventually be signed to a big label and be one of the leaders of the NWOAHM movement.\n",
        "\nIf mimicry is the sincerest form of flattery, than Trivium must want to hump James Hetfield\u2019s leg. Never before have I heard such blatant riff-stealing in an album. It\u2019s as if Trivium went out and bought every Metallica and Megadeth album from the 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s and took all the riffs and either slowed them down or sped them up thinking no one would notice. Come on Trivium, give us a little credit. I realize that bands steal riffs from each other all the time, even Metallica is guilty of this, but The Crusade\u2019s use of stolen material is unprecedented. \n\nSo why didn\u2019t I give this album an utterly putrid score you ask? Well, I have to give the guys in Trivium credit: They can play their instruments very well. Matt Heafy and Corey Beaulieu are excellent guitarists, showing a degree of complexity and virtuosity in their playing that is unusual for musicians as young as they are. The drummer, Travis Smith is very talented as well; keeping a very tight beat that serves as the backbone of the songs on the album. The bass player, Paolo Gregoletto, might be good, but I can barely hear him at all thanks to The Crusade\u2019s pop-rock styled production. The Crusade is way overproduced. Trivium front man Matt Heafy claims that The Crusade is a thrash metal album, a genre known for its raw, unpolished sound. The Crusade sounds like it had the same producer as Avril Lavigne and the result is an album that sounds like thrash metal with training wheels. While I feel like Trivium may have done this intentionally to attract a wider audience (IE: fourteen year old girls that shop at Hot Topic) I don\u2019t need my thrash watered down. \n\nI mentioned above that the guys in Trivium show a degree of musicianship beyond their years. While these guys are able to play their instruments well, they can\u2019t write songs worth a damn. The entire album sounds like it\u2019s just going through the motions. There\u2019s no passion, no emotion. Guitar solos sound like they are thrown in to the songs just for the sake of having guitar solos. There are no memorable or catchy riffs in this album save the ones they stole from other bands. And Heafy\u2019s vocals: Oh God do they ever suck. Note to Matt: You are not James Hetfield, so stop trying to sing like him. You sound like a prepubescent twit trying to impersonate his daddy on the phone to trick a telemarketer. After hearing Matt\u2019s vocals on The Crusade, I longed for his screamed vocals on their past albums, which I never thought were very good in the first place. And what\u2019s the deal with the eight minute instrumental, self-titled track? I haven\u2019t heard a more boring instrumental in my life. It\u2019s as if they just took all the riffs they couldn\u2019t form songs around and mashed them together.\n\nAs bad as the songwriting is, the lyrics are ten times worse. They sound as if they were written by a pissed-off twelve year old. The lyrics are just one clich\u00e9 after another. I have no problem with anti-war, left-wing lyrics, but the ones on this album are laughably bad. Take the following lyrics from the song, Ignition:\n\nRaise the guns\nAt every self-made suspicion\nBuild the bombs\nCorrupt policy's decision\nOur Leaders Preach if we disagree\nWe're the traitors of society\nHomophobia\nRacism\nSexism\nOur Systems breed supremacy.\n\nWow\u2026 I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. Trivium makes Greenday look like Noam Chomsky.\n\nI think buried somewhere underneath the stolen riffs, poorly written songs, and laughably bad lyrics is a decent album, but I\u2019m not going to bother trying to find it. It\u2019s a real shame because it\u2019s obvious that the guys in Trivium have some serious chops. Perhaps someday they will realize their true potential and release something worth listening to. Until then, I\u2019ll pass.\n",
        "\nI would like to thank ANationalAcrobat for coining the term \"Heafy metal\", Trivium's true genre.\n\nNow Trivium is one of those bands that kids of my generation fawn over with uncalled-for praise: \"Teh best metal bnad EVAR!\", \"Better than (insert any old band)\", \"The saviors of METAL!\" and so on and so forth. Trivium as a band is not always horrible: They are talented, though they obviously fell asleep in \"Songwriting 101\" and \"How to sound old-school but fresh\"; They have some good ideas, though it's spread so thin, they hardly seem good anymore; lastly, I'll give them the honor of being a metal band. I said metal band, I didn't say thrash or good. They are in fact 'Heafy metal'.\n\nWhat is 'Heafy metal' you ask? Just put on this dreck of an album and you'll get a pretty good idea: Stolen riffs a-plenty; Hetfield-ish vox that does not even ONCE attempt to sound different; A bassplayer that's just there to complete the line-up; Drums that go nowhere; Pop worthy production; and, last but certainly not least, the more-metal-than-thou attitude that comes with it. Here's an example of that last point: In a December 2006 issue of Metal Hammer, Trivium proudly declares \"Fuck metalcore, we're real metal!\" but that couldn't be further from the truth. I, like most metal fans, think metalcore to be a horrible genre with very few redeeming features/bands. Trivium was, in fact, one of the most ardent proponents of the genre until they realized that they could make even MORE money by playing Heafy metal (He played metalcore for TWO full albums before abandoning that cashcow). \n\nHeafy metal is simple: First, listen to MOP, RTL, RIP and all the other three-letter-abbreviated thrash albums. Then write 'politically and socially conscious' lyrics which is a by-phrase for \"Look we write about something that's on the news! Aren't we different/cool?\" Heafy himself has said \"And Sadness Will Sear\" was written about some guy who was killed because of his sexual orientation (I shit you not folks!) in response to all the \"bullshit metal lyrics that's about Dungeons & Dragons and blahblahblah\". But how is \"And Sadness Will Sear\" politically and socially conscious? Because they saw it on cable news?\n\nIndeed, many of the lyrics in The Crusade are based on whatever the hell's on Fox News (yes Indonesia has that channel. I for one, welcome our American overlords) at 6 o'clock on a Christmas morning (I love my non-sequitur references). To wit: \"Entrance of a Conflagration\" is about a mom killing his children, \"Contempt Breeds Contamination\" is about a guy BEING killed, oh the variety. Yet when Heafy tries to write about other things, his lyrics end up being absurd as fuck! \"Becoming the Dragon\" a cautionary tale of a koi turning to a dragon, \"Anthem (The Ant Farm)\" a \"Skin O' My Teeth\" rip-off with lyrics about God-knows-what. And they call themselves 'politically and socially conscious'\n\nBut I don't go off on albums just because the lyrics are god awful. The musicianship is more important, and while they are capable of playing, they are incapable of writing anything memorable...or even original. Listen to the intro of \"Becoming the Dragon\" I like that part...when it was called \"Black Prophecies\". And Jesus Christ, Trivium! Can't you change \"Anthem (The Ant Farm)\" at least one bit to make it a little less \"Skin O' My Teeth\"? Oh and don't you just love his emo-ish crooning and that intro to \"Entrance of the Conflagration\" (Symphony X does choir bits much better)? And when they solo, though technical and somewhat enjoyable at times, they will often dip to pseudo-Petrucci-isms (no surprise there, Heafy brags on and on about how Rock Discipline is his friggin' Bible) and, in the case of \"Detonation\", Slayer-isms! I think Paranoidave said it best with that video, you know \"Dear Tony Shaun\", the part with the shots of Kerry King.\n\nThe absolute worst 'song' (if it can be called as such) is the title track. Here, Trivium decides to do \"Orion\" and be Dream Theater at the same time. The results, like when DT covered MOP, is horrifying. At the same time, this song has some good riffs, bass runs (hard to hear, thanks to the production) and drumwork. Thankfully the Hetfield vox aren't present, so that's a plus...of sorts. This song tries so hard to be awesometastic(tm) and epic, they lengthened the song to eight or so minutes of the most excruciating aural torture since St. Anger (pick any 'song'). It's much better if this had just been five minutes, they repeat parts without regard for 'flow' or 'cadences' or other apparently foreign (to Trivium) musical terms.\n\nThe production, as I said before, is pop worthy. It's like every other 'modern metal' band: Guitars and vocals are front and center; L-O-U-D Drums; Non-existent bass. Clean production is fine, but this is supposed to be THRASH (hey they said it, not I) for God's sake! A genre known for unclean production. Bah! I just can't go on anymore.\n\nConclusion: Although Trivium plays Heafy metal now, they are still as shitty as ever. The band members are capable of playing but they cannot make anything that is worth listening. I gave them 9 points just for that. I know, I'm too kind. \n\nDon't buy it, borrow it, download it, or steal it. It's nothing but a waste of time and money. I paid Rp 75,000 (don't fret it's US$7.00, but that's still too much) for this and never have I wanted my money back so badly, I could've bought Killing Is My Business... in that same shop.\n\nFor the love of metal, Heafy! Get a METAL songwriter or stick to Caphanaum (though that's Suecof's project rather than Heafy's)! Now I'll need some trepanning to get this album out of my head and the abomination that is Heafy metal, I can't believe I spent about a thousand words on a review. (Sidenote: I look like Paolo Gregoletto, but more tan and taller)\n",
        "\nTrivium is an awesome band and I recommend them without hesitation...except for two minor problems.\n\n1. They steal practically every song they write. Don't believe me? Grab their Ascendancy album and listen to \"Pull Harder on the Strings of your Martyr\". That's right, they stole Carcass's \"Corporal Jigsaw Quandary\", sprinkled in some melodic choruses and bad breakdowns, and claimed writing credit! Listen to the opening riff of \"Unrepentant\". It sounds exactly like the main riff of Metallica's \"Through the Never\". Are there any Petrucci fans in the house? Listen to the closing instrumental and tell me it doesn't VERY familiar. Sometimes whole song structures are ripped off (for example, \"Becoming the Dragon\" is just a sped up version of Metallica's \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\"). And let's not forget the star atrocity. \"Anthem (We are the Fire)\" is basically a heavy metal cover of Survivor's \"Eye of the Tiger.\" You're probably thinking I'm making that up, and I wish I was. Listen to the two songs and you'll notice obvious similarities. The chucklefucks in Trivium stole the Rocky III theme song. AAAARRRRGH!!!\n\nThere's so much \"borrowed\" material on this album it boggles the mind. Just on one playthrough riffs and chords seem to jump out at you, making you think \"haven't I heard that before somewhere? Like...on Metallica's early CDs?\" I understand lots of metal bands steal from each other. Hell, Metallica themselves aren't exactly innocent of it. But when your whole CD is a five finger discount, well, that's just lame. I really wonder why more Trivium fans haven't tipped to this yet (on second thought, I don't. The average Trivium fan was listening to Slipknot and Disturbed 2 years ago and can be forgiven for a less than comprehensive knowledge of metal.)\n\n2. The metalcore influence. It's true the band has abandoned most of their metalcore stylings in favor of a more up-front thrash style, but there's still a lot of metalcore on this album. Unlike most metalheads I don't think metalcore is a total loss (Isle of Man and Mendeed were/are good bands and come with my recommendation) but the demarcation of good metalcore exists far north of Trivium. For starters, we have lots of annoying breakdowns all over the place. Second, several of the songs (notably \"The Rising\" and \"Unrepentant\") have ill-advised melodic choruses that sound laughably out of place. It's interesting that the band can't seem to pull themselves away from metalcore even though they have publicly denounced the genre and said that they never had anything to do with it, and doubly interesting since early interviews exist where Matt Heafy professes his love of metalcore and \"the scene\". Oh well, no-one could ever accuse this band of having integrity...\n\nIf you're capable of getting over those two speedbumps, you'll find The Crusade to be a decent and mostly entertaining listen. Once this band starts writing their own songs and playing actual thrash, I can see them going places. The songs are really technical and complex and full of dueling guitar solos and rapidly-changing riffs. The band are undeniably talented musicians. In fact, I'm willing to call Corey Bealeau a better guitarist than Kirk Hammett. At least he knows how to solo without a wah-wah pedal.\n\nPeople love to bash Heafy's voice and I will admit these criticisms are valid. He sounds quite syrupy and auto-tuned, and not at all like the rugged James Hetfield voice he's obviously shooting for. But I give the guy kudos because he's making an effort to put on a thrash performance this time rather than his previous metalcore screams.\n\nThere are no fast songs in the sense of Metallica's \"Battery\", and this gives the album a rather uniform listen, but it still pulls together as a cohesive whole. \"Entrance to the Conflagration\" has choral backing vocals that give it a nice atmosphere, as well as a good chorus and solo. \"Tread the Floods\" is also certified headbanger material. I'm not really fond of the slower songs but they're still well-written and sufficiently moody. The album's best moment is in the closing instrumental. Despite the material stolen from Petrucci it's still a very tight and entertaining 8 minutes that meshes prog metal sensibilities with the band's own metalcore/thrash style, and is proof that this band does in fact hold promise.\n\nThere's a great band deep down inside Trivium, somewhere hiding. They have the technical ability, they obviously demonstrate the correct influences (perhaps TOO MANY of the correct influences, if you catch my drift), but they refuse to capitalize upon their abilities. It's like they're taunting the metal world. How can a band perform such blatant thievery and yet still write something as brilliant as the aforementioned instrumental? Is it a joke? No. It is real.\n\nI'm kind of undecided about this. I'm sure Trivium will eventually release something I'll enjoy, but they're not there yet. Besides, anyone who releases a butchered metalcore version of \"Eye of the Tiger\" and claims they wrote it is just plain evil, dude.\n",
        "\nTrivium are one of many bands that are publicly considered to be at the top of the modern metal heap, beginning as a humble metalcore outfit before allegedly refining their sound into an exciting and explosive modern thrash giant. Billed by the mainstream as the next biggest thing since Metallica, Trivium\u2019s well-documented ascent into the realm of true metal was undoubtedly going to raise the eyebrows of even the oldest hands. Could a so-called metalcore band really make the leap into thrash metal convincingly? The mainstream metal community certainly seemed to think so upon reception of The Crusade, Trivium\u2019s top-selling \u201906 release.\n\nIt only takes a quick listen of the first couple songs to see that these guys are just as influenced by Avenged Sevenfold as they are Metallica. Though there\u2019s a few generic double time passages (Unearth style, meh), most of the band\u2019s songwriting relies on pseudo-aggressive half-thrash and melodic metalcore hooks. Vocalist Matt Heafy\u2019s vocal delivery consists of two parts James Hetfield worship and about eight parts whiny emo bitch. His playing isn\u2019t much better, as nowadays you can hear more competent solos and riff progressions from even the greenest and most generic power metal band. Of the two guitarists, Corey Beaulieu is the better, but again, neither are much more than shitty Alexi Laiho clones. Bass and drums are standard for the genre, though there are a few bass solos (if I heard correctly). Actually, the fact that I could hear the bass at all is a plus, as many of their contemporaries\u2019 bass lines simply imitate the guitars. Why even have bassists if you aren\u2019t going to use them? But yeah, bassists and drummers like Paolo Gregoletto and Travis Smith respectively are a dime a dozen.\n\nMore irritating than the band\u2019s mediocrity is their songwriting; which makes full use of the fictitious genre tag Metalli-core. The band fluidly alternates between pilfered Metallica-isms and metalcore clich\u00e9s often enough to ruin even the songs that appear at first to be listenable. There\u2019s actually a fair amount of modern rock/nu-metal elements incorporated as well, most obvious in the down-tempo songs and in chorus passages. There\u2019s no way to avoid being offended by this band: either you have to listen to shitty metalcore, shitty Metallica thievery, or shitty numetal. The only decent track on the whole damn thing is the last one, their \u201cepic\u201d instrumental \u201cThe Crusade.\u201d It\u2019s fairly technical and has a small handful of above-average solos, plus you don\u2019t have to listen to Heafy\u2019s shitty voice. Always a good thing in my book.\n\nAdditionally, Trivium\u2019s half-hearted attempt to display their social relevance lyrically fails to about the same degree as everything else they try to do. A few songs reference specific tragic events (\u201cEntrance to the Conflagration,\u201d \u201cUnrepentant\u201d), but they\u2019re described in a way that\u2019s so boringly blatant I\u2019d much rather have just read about them in the paper. Other songs show the band\u2019s lack of maturity by trying to be the voice of their generation and speaking out against injustices (\u201cIgnition\u201d) while displaying opposite sentiments of feel-good unity (\u201cThe World Can\u2019t Tear Us Apart\u201d) and juvenile revenge (\u201cTo the Rats\u201d). It seems Heafy and co. want to wear as many hats as possible, as they\u2019re clearly trying to lyrically appeal to scenesters from every camp.\n\nGood thing it doesn\u2019t take a seasoned intellectual to figure how shallow this band really is. When the media\u2019s love affair with metalcore ends, you can bet that these trend-whores will be right on top of the next big thing, ready to pick our pockets to fuel their lack of integrity. Were they forced to stand on their own feet they\u2019d probably have withered away like every other flash-in-the-pan modern metal has-been. If nobody bought into their bullshit, they might just disappear.\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping that Trivium\u2019s end comes swiftly. Don\u2019t buy The Crusade.\n",
        "\nAfter listening to this album I was very thankful I downloaded it, rather than wasting money on it. If you are planning on listening to it, I advise you do the same. However before you do listen to it, I have to warn you\u2026\n\nTrivium\u2019s Crusade left me with a few questions: Where the hell did that come from? Why the hell did they do this? Who the fuck allowed them to do this? And will they do this again? First of all, the band sounds completely different. You might think that\u2019s a good thing seeing as how they weren\u2019t good before. But now they\u2019re worse. If I had to describe the new sound I would call it an 80s thrash rip off mixed with poorly executed teenage angst. By poorly executed teenage angst I mean some of the lyrics sound like Good Charlotte. Yes, I just compared Trivium to a pop-punk band. Where this becomes most evident is in the music video for Anthem (which doesn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s name) in which the band trash a teenage house party and play \u201cmetal\u201d in the back yard.\n\nMatt Heafy\u2019s vocals may be the biggest change in the sound. If you have read anything about this album you will have heard that he is trying to copy Metallica\u2019s sound. Well that\u2019s entirely true. I have no clue how he could possibly deny it as it sounds exactly the same. I guess you could respect him for performing such an uncanny impression, but I certainly don\u2019t. We do however hear a few passages of harsh vocals, on the song Becoming the Dragon for example, although they don\u2019t last very long and are soon forgotten. \n\nThere aren\u2019t really any stand-out tracks, only ones that suck a bit less than the others. The title track (also the conclusion) is definitely the best. This is because it is an instrumental and seems to be Trivium\u2019s attempt at being progressive, and they don\u2019t do too badly at it. It\u2019s no Opeth but was anyone expecting that?\n\nThe previous album (Ascendancy) wasn\u2019t exactly a breakthrough but at least it had it\u2019s moments of decency, I can\u2019t really say the same about this. Although for a metal core album it wasn\u2019t all that bad. The only thing that came close to impressive on The Crusade was the musicianship. There are a few cool riffs but, of course, they are mainly unoriginal thrash rip-offs.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t only recommend this album on the following conditions: You are a huge guitar freak and are interested in possible up and coming guitarists, or if you enjoyed Metallica\u2019s St. Anger. If you don\u2019t fit into those categories, I can only advise that you ignore this album.\n",
        "\nType in \"Trivium\" on youtube always turns out to be enjoyable moments for me. Whether it be a live version of \"A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation\" or a video of \"To the Rats\", reacting to all those comments is always fun. On one side, there are the fanboys, who claim Trivium to be the metal saviours, ture definers of Thrash or the new Metallica/Maiden. On the other hand, there are the haters, who all think Trivium sucks, or are clearly just another metalcore band. What I want to point out with this paragraph? I don't know. I just recommend it to anyone with a good grasp of the English language to piss off some people (whether it be haters or lovers) with some valid argumentations, knowing that they'll crawl in despair having someone to react on their worthless rant/praise.\n\nAs I'm writing this new paragraph, I suddenly CAN think of a meaning of the previous paragraph. Many reactions of fanboys towards people showing disrespect contain the ever so smart argument \"you just hate them because their famous and earn money, and because you think they're metalcore\". I, however, think that I can speak of the majority of the haters that we have other reasons not to like it. The dreadful music for example, or the arrogance of the band. There are in fact several reasons why I see this release as one of the negative turns of metal with mainstream succes.\n\nMainstream succes, yes. This record has got quite some attention. Mostly because of the general sound they play. Melodic metalcore may not sound as the right term to express this band's sound, but it is the most accurate. Expect metal in the sense of melodic death metal, but without the death-sound. The first song already proves that. Rain is an energetic song. The verse is speedy, the chorus catchy. Whether this song is good or not is up to debate, but it is undeniable true that in terms of originality, this song contributes nothing.\n\nAs the album moves on, various imitations of Rain pass by. All do they have the speedy verse, and all do they have the catchy chorus. This is the biggest reason why Trivium did go wrong with this album. Riffs are bland and unoriginial. Take any general metal band in existence, and there are too many similarities to call Trivium good songwriters. While the riffs are just boring to listen to, the solo's are definitely more enjoyable. Although it's all written in a neat minor scale, and even though most of it reeks to mindless wankery, the melodies in it fit the music.\n\nAll of this is directed by vocalist/guitarist Matt Heafy. A person known not only for his guitar talented, arrogance but also of his voice. To explain his voice is simple. He does is bad. Bad how he rips his vocal chords apart, and bad how it sounds. Although his clean vocals are not as bad to listen to, listening to his forced screaming is a pain. In most of the songs Matt tried to balance the dynamics with doing screams in the verse, and clean vocals in the chorus. Not only proves this the lack of songwriting talent, it also makes me to think I put the album on repeat-song.\n\nThere are, however, still some enjoyable moments throughout the album. Dying in your Arms is, save for the bridge, a simple but funny song. Leads and solo's in songs such as Departure, Declaration or A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation prove that these guys DO have the potential. It's just not enough to be anything enjoyable. If Trivium really want to make an album that will not only please the mainstream audience, but also the casual metalhead, Trivium needs to create something unique. Something that doesn't sound like the 10000 other \"heavy metal\" bands.\n",
        "\nOne day, I was looking at a Guitar World magazine that I recently got. I noticed an article about Trivium releasing a new album and how they were \"the new top charts of metal\". The article continued to talk about how this album was bringing thrash back into the mainstream and was one of the golden albums of the decade. So I decided, why not go ahead and buy it. After listening to it several times through, this is what I have to say.\n\nThe overall musicianship and songwritting is very decent. The songs have some pretty good riffs and the solos are indeed very technical. Matt Heafy and Corey Beaulieu are very talented at guitar. Easily, the solos are the best part of the album. Travis Smith is a talented drummer too, lots of double bass and some sweet fills. It's hard to notice bassist Paolo Gregoletto but he has a couple of really cool bass solos. As for the vocals, Matt attempts to sound like James Hetfield a lot. Is he good at it? Yes, but he's still not at James' level. Also, the lyrics are kind of weak and cheesy. But overall, The Crusade has some very enjoyable songs. Best songs on the album are Ignition, Entrance of the Conflagration, Becoming the Dragon, and To The Rats.\n\nThe production is pretty good. All the instruments are solid and clear. The bass doesn't stand out a lot, but it's still hearable.\n\nHowever, there are problems. The songs are enjoyable, but there's really nothing on this album that stands out a lot. There's just nothing on this album that's amazing. And like I said, the vocals and lyrics aren't very strong, so that makes it even worse. The songs aren't \"classic\" at all.\n\nAlso I want to mention that Matt Heafy wanted to have the album be a thrash album and an album that was as amazing as Master of Puppets. In that article I read, he said \"We are going to be the next Metallica!\" Ok, Matt, there's something you should know. This album is not thrash. It's more thrash influenced than Ascendancy was, but I still call it nu-metal/metalcore. Is that bad? No. But calling it straight thrash is pushing it to much. Is this album as amazing as Master of Puppets? Not even close. Keep dreaming Matt, I don't think anyone will write something as great as Master. And Trivium being the next Metallica? That's laughable. If he's talking about Metallica in the mid 90's to present (Load to St. Anger), that might be possible.\n\nAside from how arragont and cocky Matt Heafy is, The Crusade is a pretty good album but nothing amazing. I like it, but I wouldn't recommend it to fans of older metal. Good album though.\n",
        "\nTrivium were viewed as a prodigy. The new \u2018Metallica\u2019, the metal saviour, and this album, \u201cAscendancy\u201d was to be their hyped-up masterpiece. For some, this was everything and more, but to me, I find it run-of-the-mill metal.\n\nThe album consists of eleven songs (plus an intro) yet not one of them can really distinguish itself from the rest. The usual \u2018verse-chorus-verse-chorus\u2019 is rinsed and repeated throughout the entire disc and the clean sung choruses run riot from start to finish. This is Trivium\u2019s downfall, their lack of innovation to try and provide something more than the standards of this genre. \n\n\u201cPull harder on the strings of your martyr\u201d was sent around the net and appeared on numerous Roadrunner sample discs given out. It was the lead in track for the album and many listeners were instantly hooked. One of them being myself, for the track contains all the thrash/metalcore elements you would want. The powerful drum intro, the throaty vocals and the wonderful chorus. This track and a few praising words from the press was enough to lull the masses into purchasing the album, yet, what wasn't shown was the lack of ideas that filled the remainder of the disc. Of course, the majority of the tracks contain fairly infectious choruses coupled with the \u2018never-changing\u2019 rough vocals, but by the time your reach the last two songs it all becomes much of a muchness. The only light between the similar tracks is the short, yet terribly catchy \u201cDying in your arms\u201d. To many this can be the lowlight for it displays the more commercial side of Trivium, but for me it is welcome relief. The only other track that deserves mention is \u201cLike light to flies\u201d. Another typical Trivium tune, but one of the better ones.\n\nThe tracks on \u201cAscendency\u201d may be consistent with each other, but it is the lyrics of Matt Heafy that need revision. The songs are there to display emotion and more importantly aggression, but the lyrics don\u2019t have to be as plain. \u201cFuck their ways it is time to break free, fuck their hate acceptance is what we need\u201d. If I was deaf, I would say this band was nu-metal. The whole album is riddled with weak lyrics that leave a lot to be desired. \u201cTie the noose around my neck, make this life end\u201d.\n\nTo dwell on just the negatives of the album would not be fair, for \u201cAscendancy\u201d overall is not too bad. Besides from similar song structures and weak lyrics, it does provide listeners with catchy and sometimes memorable choruses, it just doesn\u2019t reach the hype surrounding it before it was unleashed. The tracks are solid from beginning to end which is more than some bands can offer, and hence a score of 82 is given.\n",
        "\nI thought I \u00b4d try out Trivium, because they have won so much popularity in the last few years especially in the US. So I listened to this single and the first thing that came to my mind. \u201cDamn, these guys must be hot, cause their music is pretty damn shit.\u201d \n\nFirst I was wondering why this band is represented on this site, because the sound is not really metal, and I got the impression, especially the singer is more singing boy band-pop than anything that could work in the metal area. \n\nThe instrumental skills in \u201cEntrance of the Conflagration\u201d are not bad, but they are very out of place. The song starts with easy guitar riffs which are repeating again and again.And suddenly the guitar solos start and you have the feeling that this is not the same song anymore. At least I got the impression that the band was trying to show their whole skills just in these few seconds and the guitar changes riffs and rhythm like mad. \n\nBut the instrumental part is definitely not the worst thing about the song. I thought it would be nice to hear clean vocals for a change but that whining voice was not the one I was hoping to hear. Trying to hear true emotions out of that voice is like trying to make a cat bark. Just simply impossible! \n\n\u201cEntrance of the Conflagration\u201d is a middle-class, very boring single without any special notes to it. A waste of time if you ask me.\n",
        "\nTrivium has had their fingers in the last massive metal movement that came through the United States. Ascendancy was one of the more impressive albums that came out of the metal core movement \u2013 Trivium did that fairly well. I\u2019m not a fan of metalcore but they did play that genre well. \n\nThe Crusade is Trivium\u2019s third full length album and a strange one on that. I\u2019m all for bands trying to find their sound and playing what they love \u2013 but The Crusade is a little far. As in the previous reviews on this site\u2026saying that the Crusade sounds like Metallica doesn\u2019t really convey that thought. I mean, shit, a lot of bands take ideas from Metallica and use them. Trivium just down right carbon copied the formula Metallica uses. Right down to Hetfield\u2019s vocals\u2026but you have heard this before. Let\u2019s get on. \n\nTrivium decided that on The Crusade that they were going to become a thrash band. Hell, I\u2019m all for that! I love thrash. Too bad they kind of suck at thrash. But, we\u2019ll get to that. The Crusade literally has every element that makes thrash\u2026well\u2026thrash. It has some thundering riffs overlaid with melodic parts. It has flaming solos and drums that went from being one sided as on Ascendancy to being towards a thrash tendency. Even the vocals went from being a barked at the audience to Hetfield-inspired harsh vocals. The writing is inspired by being angry and there is a good sense of discontent in the music. \n\nSo Trivium have taken their number one inspiration, Metallica, and changed their metal core ways to become a modern thrash band. Sounds pretty good right? Well even though above I stated all the reasons it SHOULD be a good thrash\u2026The Crusade isn\u2019t. Why? If it has all this thrash inspiration and elements, it has to be thrash. No it doesn\u2019t. Trivium proved that. What The Crusade doesn\u2019t have is the mentality of thrash. Thrash is a sub-genre that pulls on the idea that nothing is over polished. It\u2019s a raw sound and any thrash bands that try to overproduce or over think it start putting out mediocre thrash. Trivium over analyzed thrash and then over produced it. It\u2019s too damn radio friendly. Not that radio friendly is bad\u2026but man album is written and recorded for all the wrong reasons. And that undermines every element that makes thrash. Too much focus on the details rather than the foundation that thrash is built on. The album itself has talent on it. Unfortunately Trivium missed the target. \n\nSo through all these thoughts I came to one conclusion: Trivium is trying to take over another metal sub-genre. They are on a \u201ccrusade\u201d to conquer all of metal! Pretty soon they are going to try symphonic black metal and try to become the most recognized band in that sub-genre. Dammit\u2026this needs to stop. It is my recommendation that if Trivium changes their sub-genre one more time that the government step in and split their monopoly. Cause this is ridiculous.\n",
        "\nSo, I made the mistake of reading some iTunes reviews for this album (seriously, the spelling and grammar in my review title was not much of an exaggeration), and I noticed that someone called it the \"Master of Puppets of our generation.\"\n\nNow as stupid as that sounds (does anyone seriously believe that this is going to be anywhere near as influential?), there's actually a lot of truth to it. In some ways, The Crusade is just like Master of Puppets - only worse. I mean, just listen to it. Everything that dragged Puppets down is here, just in greater magnitude.\n\nConsider:\n\nMaster of Puppets featured blatantly stolen riffs (the title track for instance, just ask Metal Church) and plenty of stolen ideas (most notably \"Leper Messiah\"), but at least the sound was still fresh and the scene new, plus, the riffs that weren't jacked from other bands were pretty killer (see: \"Battery\" and \"Disposable Heroes\"). Trivium, on the other hand, offers absolutely nothing we haven't heard before, and very few good riffs. Anyone with an extensive knowledge of metal will hear a lot of passages on this album that sound oddly familiar, altered versions of riffs and leads from other bands - especially Iron Maiden and Metallica. Oh, and who could forget the fact that the first track, \"Ignition,\" kicks off with an only slightly modified version of the main riff from Behemoth's \"Conquer All.\" Way to get off to a good start, guys, but next time try it with a riff YOU wrote. Unfortunately the best they can do on their own appears to be the very typical modern pseudo-thrash riff work that Nevermore and Testament can pull off so much more convincingly.\n\nThen there are the vocals. James Hetfield sounded like a metal vocalist should on \"Master of Puppets.\" Matt Heafy sounds like...a bad imitation of James Hetfield. Oh sure, he claims that since \"James Hetfield is the most recognized voice in heavy metal, so people are always going to compare you to what's popular,\" but I'm pretty familiar with metal vocalists in general, popular and obscure, and believe me, he sounds like a bad imitation of James Hetfield. Or at least, he does most of the time; the rest of the time it's back to his almost-emo crooning that we had to endure on Ascendancy and Ember to Inferno. What really bothers me is that he's capable of much better. I saw Trivium at Sound of the Underground this past summer, and Matt sounded great without reminding me even slightly of Hetfield. If he'd just sound like that on the albums, I'd probably like this band a bit more.\n\nNext up, the solos. On Master of Puppets, Kirk Hammet was just starting to abuse his wah petal, but his solos were pretty good. More importantly, they fit perfectly into the songs. On the other hand, while Matt and Corey up some blazing solos, they seem to be soloing just to solo. The Crusade is pretty much trying to be metal-by-numbers, and so of course there are solos because that's what metal bands do, right? There are a few exceptions, but most of the solos on the album appear to be there just for the sake of having them. Yawn.\n\nThere's not much to be said about the bass other than that Cliff Burton was good and Paolo Gregoletto might be, but we'll never know because they've buried him in the mix.\n\nLike Master of Puppets, The Crusade features a worthless instrumental. \"Orion\" was just plain boring, especially compared to \"Call of Ktulu,\" but the title track from The Crusade is garbage for a different reason. It's got some terrific moments, but it flows so poorly that I have a suspicion that Trivium just used it as a way to do something with all the riffs they liked but couldn't build songs around.\n\nAnd last of all, there are the lyrics. Here more than ever, The Crusade takes a shortcoming of Master of Puppets to all-new lows. Trivium's lyrics have always been bad, but this time they're absolutely appalling. You know how some bands have lyrics so bad you find yourself actually wincing once in a while? Well, with Trivium, it's not \"every once in a while\" so much as \"every few seconds.\" The lyrics on The Crusade are what I'm sure the band would call \"socially and politically conscious,\" which means that in between sappy love songs (\"All the hate in this world can't tear us apart, this love is forever\") and stupid calls to arms for their fans (\"The music connects, unites us more/Our masses strengthened, an unstoppable horde/We're all now a family/Together let's show the world what we say\"), we're subjected to pseudo-informed rants from Matt Heafy. \"Systems breed supremacy.\" Wow. Well said; did you come up with that for yourself? Now, I'm a pretty liberal guy, so the fact that he decries hate crimes isn't what bothers me; I'm also sane and fairly intelligent, so I've got no problem that he criticizes the powers that be (who in their right mind wouldn't?). But the way he does it is so juvenile and simple-minded, so lacking in subtlety (sort of a key ingredient in lyrics and poetry), that it actually almost ruins the songs for me. Master of Puppets had its share of cringeworthy lyrics as well, but I'll take \"Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me\" over \"Our leaders preach/If we disagree/We're the traitors of society\" any day. Matt Heafy might be 20, but he writes like an angry 14 year old.\n\nNow, this album isn't all bad - some of the songs are catchy, and some have a few decent riffs (although nothing special). Taken by themselves, a few of the songs are actually all right, \"Tread the Floods\" in particular. But when you have to listen to a whole album of it, it gets old pretty quickly. \n\nI'm sure that people who like this album will just say that I'm being a typically narrow-minded metalhead who can't stomach anything that's popular in the mainstream, so I'd just like to say in closing that I'm anything but tr00 (nobody who listens to as much pop and country as I do can claim to be). I don't dislike this album because it's popular, I dislike it because the solos are boring, the riffs are unoriginal, the songs lack passion, the attempt at thrash fails miserably, the influences are too obvious, the vocals suck, the lyrics suck, and the whole bland package lacks anything even remotely unique. I had high hopes for this album after seeing these guys live (just read my Ascendancy review), but it turns out I was mistaken. I felt sure they were going to put out a terrific and genuinely metal album, and while this is definitely metal (a lot more so than Ascendancy), its ubiquitous absence of both originality and intensity makes it just as mediocre as their last outing. Sorry Trivium, better luck next time.\n",
        "\nWhat were/are my most anticipated albums of 2006? Off the top of my head there is Motorhead's Kiss of Death, Into Eternity's The Scattering of the Ashes, Cellador's Enter Deception, Blind Guardian's A Twist in the Myth, and of course, Iron Maiden's A Matter of Life and Death. After that, there were/are bands that, though I am not a fan of them, I wanted to check out anyways, just to see where the band would take their careers next. Some of these would be Strapping Young Lad's The New Black, Falconer's Northwind, and quite obviously Trivium's The Crusade.\n\nNow, Trivium was never a band that really impressed me. Sure they've got a couple good songs (I've always been partial to The Deceived off of Ascendancy), but up until now they haven't done anything spectacular enough to warrant the praise and hype leading up to The Crusade. Yet for some reason, I was really looking forward to this album. Perhaps it was the prospect of vocalist Matt Heafy ditching the screaming that plagued the band's first two albums. It worked for Avenged Sevenfold, I thought. Perhaps it was silly for me to expect the exact same results from Trivium, but as soon as I got it around my head I fell victim to the hype machine as well. Oh well. When I first heard The Crusade, naturally, I was pretty disappointed. That happens with most of the music I listen to. But still, after countless listens, the album still does nothing for me. Quite the disappointment, I must say. \n\nWith The Crusade, Trivium promised their fans balls out thrash metal. They promised an album on par with Metallica's legendary Master of Puppets. Unfortunately, they band doesn't come within a country mile of an album such as that. From the album's opener to the second last track, The Rising, every track sounds exactly the same as the one before. Listening to it over and over again, I would not have realized that the song had changed without looking at the song list. Plain riff after plain riff; Hetfield-esque vocal line after Hetfield-esque vocal line; the album rarely ever changes its formula. It doesn't help when their rehashed efforts are completely boring either. The only occasion where the band escapes this apparent routine is on the very last track, the 8 minute instrumental, The Crusade. In a way, it sort of reminds me of Orion. Maybe not in structure or sound, but the fact that it will undoubtedly be praised as a masterpiece as Orion is. Perhaps I will be in the minority, but I am unable to enjoy either. As with Orion, The Crusade is much too long for its own good. Shave a good 2-4 minutes off, and you'd have a much better song. The song is very messy, and the riffs do not flow very well at all. This song in particular was probably the biggest disappointment off of The Crusade, and I feel they could have done a much better job with it. Perhaps the most enjoyable part of the album is the soloing, yet even this element does not save the band this time around. The excitement level does not rise above the bare minimum required to retain the listener's interest. For a band whose centerpiece is the guitarists and their performances, this is not a very good thing at all.\n\nHowever, one positive change that The Crusade brought Trivium was the swapping of vocal styles. As I mentioned earlier, gone is the screaming which plagued their first two releases. That's not to say I hate screaming, but when you do it as badly as Matty did on Ember to Inferno and Ascendancy, change is welcome. Instead, he employs a rougher, James Hetfield-esque, style. Despite being unoriginal, he sounds great on the first two songs, Ignition and Detonation. Unfortunately, just as nearly everything else on the album, there is little to no variety in his singing, and it gets rather old after the fifth track. With sub-par musicianship, it is certainly disappointing that Heafy's vocals are not up to snuff either. Still, it is an improvement on past releases, and that's got to count for something.\n\nThe Crusade is at its best when you do not listen to the whole thing in one sitting. Instead, the best way to enjoy the album is in (very) little bits and parts. Listening to, saaay, Detonation or Tread the Floods on its own and they aren't necessarily bad tracks. What really brings the album down, as I mentioned earlier, is the sameness of pretty much every song. Each song (with the exception of the title track) is much more interesting to listen to in a playlist of several different artists, in your Ipod or MP3 player. The songs are much easier to digest, because you aren't listening to the same song over and over and over. But this is the only way I got anything out of the songs, and I shouldn't have to do this to enjoy the material. As an all around album, The Crusade totally fails in this aspect. \n\nIs The Crusade the disappointment of the year? Possibly. Though I plenty (read, dozens) of reviews can be found claiming quite the opposite, I just can't get into the album. The entire album could be the opener, Ignition, twelve times in a row, followed by the title track, and you seriously wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Forget the musicianship which is lacking and the monotonous vocals; this is my biggest irk with the album. Before I may have claimed that Trivium can do better, but now I don't even know anymore. Matty, your band is running out of time\u2026\n\nOriginally written for Sputnikmusic\n",
        "\nTrivium is set to unleash their enigmatically devastating record \u201cAscendancy\u201d on a completely unsuspecting metal public. The band entered the scene with their Lifeforce Records debut \u2018From Ember To Inferno\u2019 a short while back and the title of that promising debut might just be the perfect phrase to sum up the progression between that album and the band\u2019s unbelievably excellent first offering for Roadrunner Records. This album carries a tremendous impact akin to throwing the best of Slayer, Sepultura, Malmsteen and Killswitch Engage into a blender and drinking it down straight with no chaser.\n\nPoints of reference aside, Trivium relay a distinctly original sound that is truly their own, having thrown together, slamming licks, blazing riffs, supercharged rhythms and some of the best vocal dynamics to hit metal listeners in the last ten years. The band\u2019s sonic attack is simply relentless, having an edgy feel about it that gives the listener the impression that they are listening to an album on a par with some of the greatest heavy metal albums ever created.\n\nThe contrasting themes of lead single \u2018Pull Harder On The Strings Of Your Martyr\u201d makes for a highly impressive listen. Containing one of the catchiest melodic choruses in recent memory, this is a song that will repeat in your memory over and over again. The stop action axe work that hails the introduction of \u2018Rain\u2019 sets the pace for a virtual slam fest of neck snapping rhythms and pure metal madness that is anchored by the substantial, thunder of bassist Paolo Gregoletto. When Matt Heafy sings \u201cTime will always be\u2026the thing that kills me truly\u201d, he exhibits a powerful set of pipes that are equally at ease screaming vicious aggro barks or resonating clean melodies. The lyrics are an impressive factor on this record, as Heafy manages to craft poignant phrases that immediately stick in your head. Combine that with interesting, relevant topical matter and you certainly have an undeniable poetic force to be reckoned with.\n\nUncontrollable tempos mesh with huge harmonies on \u2018Drowned And Torn Asunder\u2019, a song that sends chills up the spine with its sheer melody and absolutely ripping lead work. It is a vivid picture that rests upon Trivium\u2019s musical canvas, filled with energy and passion that infects the blistering strains of the title track \u2018Ascendancy\u2019. \u2018A Gunshot To The Head Of Trepidation\u2019 continues the onslaught with a pummeling double bass rhythm from drummer Travis Smith that lapses into a ferocious verse and a pre chorus break that decimates the finest of Metallica\u2019s dual axe syncopation. Listeners will be completely absorbed into the frantic refrain of \u2018Like Light To Flies\u2019, a song which features the one of the best chorus section of the entire album.\n\nIn \u2018Dying In Your Arms\u2019, the group have a definite choice for a follow up single that would completely dominate the airwaves. Commercial enough to garner a great deal of mainstream appeal, yet unabashedly aurally weighty, Trivium show that they are the modern metal masters, hands down. Things pick back up into overdrive with the thrashy, highly moshable \u2018The Deceived\u2019, which once again features a soaring vocal refrain and some savage lead work courtesy of Heafy and Corey Beaulieu that perfectly emphasizes the energy of the track. \u2018Suffocating Sight\u2019 contains riffs that are tighter than a closed vice as Heafy wails with abrasive venom. The song features a cool modulation that carries the tune to the next level to close things off. \u2018Departure\u2019 shows Trivium making good use of texture, with some great backing vocals and a chorus that builds to a pummeling crescendo. This is another track that would come off well on radio.\n\nBy far the epic track on this record is \u2018Declaration\u2019, the album\u2019s final track. Melding intense harmonies, crippling lightning speed beats and solid chunking grooves to form a driving wall of sound, this track has everything that metal fans could ask for. Again, Heafy turns in a stunning performance vocally, ranging from deep growls to high register, reverberating notes that will strike at the metal listeners very heart.\n\n\u2018Ascendancy\u2019 is a determined, chaotic hell ride of an album from start to finish and certainly an album that will be quite difficult for even the greatest of metal artists to top. Well produced, well executed and most importantly performed with an intense passion and precision, this album is completely unstoppable, fresh exciting and highly enjoyable after scores of repeated spins. Quite simply, this band is going to be huge in 2005 and most likely for many years to come.\n",
        "\nMain Entry: triv\u00c2\u00b7i\u00c2\u00b7al\nFunction: adjective\nEtymology: Latin trivialis found everywhere, commonplace, from trivium\n1 : COMMONPLACE, ORDINARY\n2 a : of little worth or importance\n\nIn light of the above definition, Trivium is the perfect name for this band. Ordinary, bland, contrived, emotionless, insipid tripe of little importance that will be forgotten in a decade. \"Oh but they can play their instruments well!\" News flash: Every year music schools across the globe graduate thousands of guitarists whose chops would put this band - and 99% of metal bands - to shame. Most of them can't write anything very interesting though. Conclusion: skill is irrelevant to quality. If you defend a band by saying \"well at least they can play,\" remind yourself it doesn't matter by telling yourself, \"so can guitarist number 72 from Juilliard's class of '98.\" Get over it.\n\nThe vocals have been thoroughly bashed, and what the bashers say is true. Emotionless, flat, monotonous, unintelligible. Why even have them? The alternation between harsh and calm styles is here in all its cliched glory. Scream then whine. Scream then whine. Scream then whine.\n\nThe guitar riffs are just kind of there. They don't do anything interesting, they bring no momentum to the songs, they're forgettable. The solos are played skillfully, yes, but they are there just to be there. Zzzzzz...\n\nThe lyrics. Good god the lyrics. It's probably for the best that we can't understand them. Sure many metal bands have bad lyrics, for instance Rhapsody's are over the top with cheese, and many death metal bands have brutal lyrics that are stupid written on paper - but that's the point! For brutal music you have brutal lyrics. For over-the-top epics, you write a fantasy epic about slaying enemies with your steel. The lyrics here are taken seriously, which would be OK if they were halfway decent. But they're just insipid and pretentious. They aren't even delivered completely. Most of the keywords of each line are screamed out - I guess you're supposed to interpolate the rest. For example, from the song \"Pull Harder On The Strings Of Your Martyr\" we have the line:\n\nPull Harder on the String of your Martyr \n\nHow is this line \"sung\"? \"PULL!!!! HARDER!!! STRING!!!! MARTYR!!!\" Great, makes lots of sense. \n\nSpeaking of this song, it may actually be the best thing to come out of this album. It was the inspiration for the now-infamous \"BOAT! RUDDER!\" parody video. For this I give this album a point.\n\nMany of the lyrics are laughably whiny:\n\n\"Everytime I'm left alone\nMy misery begins to drown me\nTied by a rope of anxiety\nThrown overboard\"\n\nAs for pretentious, the writers clearly intended for the lyrics to elicit a \"whoa, that's so deep\" response. Sometimes we have badly used 50-cent words. Can anyone actually read these lines aloud without laughing? You can tell they're supposed to be oh-so-deep:\n\n\"I am but a farce a satire of stability\"\n\n\"Disintegration constituents to decompose of the parts\nA malformation utopia systematic unity can't be achieved\"\n\nTrivium. (Plural is trivia.) Something of little worth. One has to wonder if this band is a cruel joke. If you could call your band \"stupid crap\" and still build up a huge, oblivious fanbase, it would be pretty funny, no?\n",
        "\nTrivium\u2019s debut album \u201cEmber to Inferno\u201d turned a lot of heads, to say the least. The young Florida natives have managed to do a lot since then. The band is now on Roadrunner Records and has done several large-scale tours. Now, Trivium are back with their second full-length release and their first on Roadrunner, titled \u201cAscendancy.\u201d\n\nThese guys are some of the most talented musicians I\u2019ve heard in a long time. \u201cEmber to Inferno\u201d was a masterpiece that set a very high precedent for the band. This is a band that I genuinely want to see go as far as they possibly can, and believe me \u2013 they can go as far as they want to. That\u2019s why \u201cAscendancy\u201d is a hugely important release for Trivium. Coming off of such a successful and brilliant album like \u201cEmber to Inferno\u201d is a tough task to take on. This is an album that could quite honestly make or break them.\n\nWell folks, this album should further establish them as one of the best young bands in all of metal. Trivium has simply done it again. They\u2019ve managed to come out with a mind-blowing album that is going to push them higher and higher. An intro titled \u201cThe End of Everything\u201d gets the album started. The subtle keyboards and acoustic guitar parts that this intro track display are quite the illusion. Once the first song \u201cRain\u201d kicks into high gear, you know you\u2019re about to be taken along for a ride. \u201cRain\u201d is a vicious beginning to the album and sets a feverish pace that the band will maintain throughout this disc. Next is \u201cPull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr,\u201d a song that displays how diverse Trivium can be. It\u2019s loaded with brutality and breakneck speed, but has just as much melody. This song should go down as one of the band\u2019s classic tracks, hands down. If you want a healthy dose of melodic metal, look no further than the title track. You can easily hear the melodic death metal influence of classic In Flames material and the like in this song. The combination of masterful guitar work and soothing melodic overtones are unbelievable in this song. The solo at 2:25 of the song also displays the technicality of Trivium, which is an attribute that you don\u2019t see enough of these days. If you want another song that should go down as a classic, check out \u201cLike Light to the Flies.\u201d This is my personal favorite song of Trivium\u2019s. It straightforwardly shows how good this band can be. I can listen to this song over and over again (believe me, I have.) \u201cDying In Your Arms\u201d is song that displays the harmonious side of the band. It\u2019s a short song, but as powerful as they\u2019ve made. It\u2019s also one of the catchiest on the album and should please a wide variety of people. This song is followed by \u201cThe Deceived,\u201d a song that is yet another work of art. The pace and overall tone of this song is something to behold.\n\nThe production on the album is solid, with everything sounding as it should be. \u201cAscendancy\u201d is as good of a progression from \u201cEmber to Inferno\u201d as anybody could wish for. The band already possessed maturity far beyond their years, and that is furthered on this album. Every song is so tight musically. You couldn\u2019t get tighter if you were wearing spandex pants that are two sizes too small. The band\u2019s songwriting also has advanced, as every song flows along well and possesses immaculate structure. Individual improvements are aplenty as well on \u201cAscendancy.\u201d Guitarist/lead singer Matt Heafy\u2019s vocals have taken a big step forward. Especially with his clean singing. The clean parts have more power and grip than on \u201cEmber to Inferno,\u201d which is absolutely amazing, considering how brilliant Heafy was on that album. Travis Smith\u2019s work on the drum kit is improving as well. There\u2019s a lot of variety in his playing \u2013 even more so than on \u201cEmber to Inferno\u201d \u2013 and he\u2019s only going to keep getting better. Every member of the band really stepped up for this album, and I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m surprised. With a band as talented as this, excellence is to be expected.\n\nTrivium is one of the best young bands in metal today. \u201cAscendancy\u201d further proves that fact and should elevate them to even bigger heights. As I said before, these guys can go as far as they want to go. With music like this, they\u2019re going to get as big as they want to be. This is an album that should be in everybody\u2019s collection. If it isn\u2019t, then you know what to do. Go buy it! This album is close to perfection, but the thing is, I think we\u2019ve yet to seen the best of what Trivium has to offer. Remember, this is only their second album and I expect them to reach gigantic heights.\n",
        "\nThis is without a doubt the single worst album I've ever heard in my life. I could not in good conscience give this a full point like I did to its predecessor, Ascendancy. I'd much rather strip myself of all musical dignity and listen to full blown mallcore, because in reality, this is just mallcore with guitar solos. Maybe it's the fact that the band spends every waking moment worshipping other bands and completely neglects the concept of originality. Whether they're endorsing Dimebag's old equipment, talking about how much Kirk Hammet loves their album, or flaunting their new Darkthrone shirt, Trivium just isn't a good band.\n\nWhen I first listened to them I was optimistic. By my rating of Ascendancy it may not seem like it, but I really did. These guys can play, but any possible technical advantages they may have are compeltely ruled out by their overbearing lack of writing skills. I honestly couldn't believe they could stoop much lower than what they had done on their last album.\n\nPeople call them the next Metallica, and by listening to The Crusade, it's no surprise. Trivium has managed to rip off Metallica in the form of a 13-song album without leaving a single note that sounds original. Matt Heafy had announced prior to the release that he didn't like screaming and wouldn't be doing it on any subsequent albums. What he really meant was that they needed to rip off James Hetfield's rough style of singing to really take their Metallica fanboyism to the next level, and by god, they did that. From the opening riffs of Detonation it's obvious that they're trying for a harsh style of thrash, but what they ended up with was an awful mallcore/metalcore Metallica knockoff. Entrance of the Conflagration is easily one of the most immature \"metal\" songs I've ever heard, as it includes every poor clich\u00e9 from the choral \"oooohs\" to the cheesy sing-along chorus.\n\nThere was some talk about how their 8-minute instrumental would turn out. In a word, it's bad. No, this particular song doesn't sound like Metallica. What it does sound like is over 8 full minutes of decent riffs slapped together so haphazardly it's like the band didn't know if they were coming or going. Just when you think Trivium has finally managed to turn off Master of Puppets for one second and written a decent riffs they follow it up with something nonsensical. \n\nAside from the tracks that stand out for better or for worse, the album flows as one giant slab of unoriginal music. Unrepentant and Ignition blend in with the rest of The Crusade's incompetently generic riffs while And Sadness Will Sear shows the band making a more than feeble attempt at writing slower, melancholic metal. The same applies to This World Can't Tear Us Apart, a faster paced song with emotion equivalent to 80's pop music. I honestly think I heard Celine Dion sing the exact same vocal lines 15 years ago that Matt Heafy manages to butcher here. Furthermore, Contempt Breeds Contamination is a rather appalling attempt at technical death metalcore, while The Rising is yet another three and a half minutes of gut-wrenchingly bad 80's metal copies.\n\nThe only vague shimmer of hope the band gives is Tread the Floods, as the opening riff manages to blend Iron Maiden with Into Eternity without sounding like a blatant copy. Unfortunately, the rest of the song is just as derivative as the rest of the album. For 57 minutes I sat and wept for the metal world, trying desperately to find something to justify the recognition the band gets for their lack of effort. When all is said and done I can honestly say that there is not a single good song on this album. For a band of such rabid Metallica worshippers you'd think they'd have more sense than to steal St. Anger of all albums. \n\nThere's no point in recommending songs because it would be like comparing dogshit to horseshit. Trivium actually managed to put out an album so bad that even the most avid Christian can't deny Jesus died in vain. The Crusade is a completely worthless, unredeemable album without any source of original, worthwhile metal. I can only pray that the rest of the world doesn't judge American metal by this, which is unfortunately what the media has deemed the leader of the next generation of metal.\n",
        "\nFirst and foremost, let's stop the nonsense. This is NOT thrash. Thrash is Reign in Blood, Among the Living, Killing is My Business...And Business is Good, Darkness Descends, Bonded By Blood, Kill 'Em All, et cetera. That's what thrash used to mean, and that's what it has always meant...except now everybody in the mainstream metal world likes to slap the thrash label on any band that can play Gothenburg riffs fast (ex. Shadows Fall, The Haunted, these guys) or who can simply beat on their guitars at reasonably frequent invervals (ex. Slipknot, Static X, both of whom have, tragically enough, actually been called thrash - as Paul Baloff rolls over in his grave). To Trivium's credit, they do, from time to time, use riffs comprised of power chords linked together by palm-muted open notes that sort of SOUND like thrash riff, plus some triplets on \"The Deceived\", but by and large this is a modern melodeath (which is barely melodeath at all anymore) album with some distict metalcore tendencies.\n\nAnd for that, it really isn't that bad. The riffs are catchy (although often insipid), the production is crystal clear, the solos are pretty well done (the one in \"Like Light to the Flies\" almost makes the whole album worthwhile), and the drumming, while not exactly Dave Lombardo- or George Kolias-caliber, definitely gets the job done.\n\nThere are really two factors that bring the album down for me, and make it impossible to listen to all the way through. The first of these is the vocals - the monotonous shout that this guy uses really does nothing for me. It's not really aggressive, it's just sort of...there. Adds nothing at all to the music. And then there's his clean singing. He can be damn good at it, and he proves this on songs like \"Rain\" and \"The Deceived,\" where he showcases a rough-edged harsh voice that is none the worse for sounding a bit like a failed attempt to channel James Hetfield. If he did the whole album that way, it would be a winner, but more often then not, the clean vocals are delivered in that blatantly contrived \"emotional\" style that, for reasons passing understanding, continues to win points for bands like this among youthful audiences. I could do an entire rant just on this subject alone, but I'll spare you all and simply say that while good vocals certainly must have feeling in them, it's not very convincing when you constantly sound like you're on the verge of tears no matter what lyrics you're actually singing.\n\nAnd speaking of the lyrics: \"This seems to suit you better/Bleeding out the eyes/Hope's left in chain suspension/Holding onto lies, to make the truth\"\n\nWhat?\n\nBut then again, I try not to let stupid lyrics bother me...after all, I listen to Cannibal Corpse and Blind Guardian, and even Trivium's adolescent poetry is nowhere near as juvenile as the former, nor as cheesy as the latter.\n\nAnyway, the other thing that bothers me about this album is that there are really few standouts. \"Rain,\" \"Like Light to the Flies,\" and \"Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr\" are really the only songs that I can single out as being measurably better than the rest; other than those, it's just more of the same. Now those other songs, taken by themselves, are alright....it's just that it gets kind of redundant to listen to a whole album of them.\n\nNow, I've spent a lot of time eviscerating this album for its weaknesses, no doubt raising the question: why do I listen to it? Well, because it's catchy, because the guitarists can actually play, and because I still entertain the hope that maybe, just maybe, these guys will mature into a decent band. I saw them live not too long ago and was very pleasantly surprised by the show they put on. The vocals were more agressive, they conducted themselves (and looked, I might add) like a real metal band, and the song they played off their upcoming album showed quite a bit of promise. Maybe touring with the likes of Cannibal Corpse, Behemoth, and the almighty Iron Maiden will do these guys some good...in any case, they've got the potential to be more that just \"okay.\"\n",
        "\nEmber to Inferno is the kind of album which everyone puts down for the sake of trying to act more hardcore. But i'm going to be honest here, this album is pretty good. Sometimes the accent and screaming vocals may be difficult to warm to, but the music sure is.\nIf anything comes out of this album, it's showing that the band is more than your average metalcore band. The main differences being that this band actually has talent and has the ability to make desirable music.\nThe drums are particularly good, as are the guitars. The patterns, riffs and solos mix and flow together perfectly to create an aura of what we today call metal. Pillars of Serpents is a brutal track with a crunching opening riff to get things rolling. From the first three tracks, colour is immediatly put into this dorment deemed album. If I Could Collapse These Masses has a line in it which stands out to me personally, \"to be one with the sea is to fly on broken wings\". There are so many possibilities for what that could mean, so it kinda leaves you guessing.\nA highlight of the album is the title track, Ember to Inferno. The whole song has a great roll to it as well as a lot of catchy riffs. Noting the guitars, they givre an excellent feel to the vocals. The guitar riffs in every song on here add a real depth to the music, from melodic riffs to hardcore tremolo picking, everything works very well. Although the production isn't the best it could be, the bands music makes up for that.\nAlso, every song has a nice headbangable rhythm to it, it's never too fast or too slow but is always heavy enough for you to get a good kick out of it. Some songs drag a little and repeat a little (To Burn The Eye), but the majority of tracks on here repeat just enough to even the balance.\nIf one thing is for sure though, this band will hit big time and big money. They aren't the \"new metallica\" or the \"newest thrash metal craze\", but what they are is a talented band with much potential.\nIn our modern era, new bands like this don't come very often, so no matter how much you enjoy the music, even if it's not your style and you hate it, we should all be appreciative that bands like Trivium are still keeping the spirit of metal burning in a world of degraded shit with squelching noises in the background.\n",
        "\nWhy did this band have to come up? Weren't there already 500 bands that played the same formula and same unintelligent riffing over and over again? This makes The Haunted seem heavier than Dark Angel, this album is one of the worst releases in music (forget metal). After their debut which sucked equally, Trivium have released another monstrosity on us that only a metalcore fanatic like my brother would worship. I had heard this album only because my brother thought it was thrash and I'd like it. He was wrong, that\u2019s FOR SURE. \n\nMusically, there's nothing exciting or new here. It's all been done before and it's done better by the only decent metalcore band in this sucky genre - Shadows Fall. The guitar leads are nothing overtly technical or well done but they\u2019re probably the only thing good about the guitar. Trivium sound totally like an extremely watered down Dark Tranquility trying to be seen as thrash by playing melodic riffs that are in no way exciting. Throw in a vocalist who has a clean voice as bad as that kid from \"Busted\" and a pussy hardcore voice and you have one of the worst bands in metal. Yes, he may be good in \"Capharnaum\" but he's total rubbish here. The drumming too is nothing special and if I may add - the only proper thing in the album. Yet, I don\u2019t listen to metal to hear the drums; drums only complement the music which completely sucks here so no points for the drumming. \n\nOn a song level, everything just sucks here. The band actually has a good intro riff in Declaration and Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation but then they decide to go all melodic and the song totally collapses. All the songs here suck, Like Light to Flies has the worst clean vocals ever recorded and Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr has annoying double-bass combined with the normal annoyances of Trivium. Every single track on this album sounds the SAME except for the last track Declaration. Declaration can be seen as the moment of glory in the bands career, its 7 minutes long and it actually keeps me interested for the first 25 seconds. Then, the song totally falls apart with nothing in it to keep me interested. \u201cDying in Your Arms\u201d sounds totally emo and has the most annoying melodic intro riff I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cRain\u201d starts off with an awesome riff but again falls apart when they go melodic and Heafy comes in. The band seems to get everything wrong and even if they do 10 seconds of right, they have to do 3 minutes of wrong to compensate. \n\nFinal Verdict: One of the worst albums ever recorded. It\u2019s not really Load, but its pretty close. The main problem with the music is \u2013 they have a sucky vocalist. Besides this, there are also other prevalent problems \u2013 drums mixed in too loud, uninteresting \u201criff\u201d and leads, vocals mixed in too loud. My advice is to stay clear of this album; this is only something a metalcore fanatic could ejaculate over \u2013 to all the others, stay away. This band\u2019s existence is unneeded, there are already 500 clones of Killswitch Emo-Gage and we don\u2019t need any more.\n",
        "\nEach day there seems to be a new metalcore act getting their video frequented on MTV and getting a spot on Ozzfest. The popularity of the scene exploded, and resulted in many new bands being described as groundbreaking and awesome. These guys, Trivium, are worshipped as the new deal after Shadows Fall, Killswitch and Lamb of God.\n\nMainman Matt Heafy has often been described as a guitar god. Maybe he is in terms of sheer wanking, but songwriting is clearly lacking here. This seems to hold a decent amount of promise in the first half minute or so of opener \"Rain\" that actually has a guitar driven rhythm. Not surprisingly, at 0.30 it fades to the usual metalcore pattern. Boring repetitive rhythms and generic barking. Oh, and did I mention that the clean vocals suck? I can deal with singing like Shadows Fall's that's just kind of mediocre at times but this is grating.\n\nSecond song even skips having a decent intro. It's pretty mediocre, having a total Arch Enemy \"Wages of Sin\" vibe. And you know what Arch Enemy plus hardcore means? Yes, this sounds like Killswitch Engage. These riff packages have been heard approximately one zillion times before. What's even worse is that they keep playing a couple of really generic \"riffs\" that are even more boring under the vocals, who are once again monotone as hell. The cleans are a bit less atrocious, still far from even being okay.\n\nThe album tends to fade even more the longer one listens, as the two first songs actually are the \"good ones\". Every song tends to sound just like the last one, despite the fact that Trivium actually has judgement enough to somewhat mix up the song lengths. Generic this undeniably is.\n\nIn the end, my listening to \"Ascendancy\" was a waste of time. I've heard this many times before and I by no means want to hear it again. Metalcore may work as gateway music for newbies or for listening in very small doses. Even if my intent was one of those things, I would pick one of the few decent acts. Trivium is not one of them.\n",
        "\nEmber of Inferno is an album that can bring you tears. Not because it's so particularly moving, but because it's so particularly horrible. Take every stereotypical element from the hordes of crappy metalcore bands that plague the metal music scene and you have an accurate idea of this Trivium album.\n\nThe intro to the album is truthfully the best you will hear off of this shitty disc, merely because it sounds nothing like the rest of the album. It's an instrumental piece that attempts to dazzle the patron with an artsy point of contrast between it and the following track, but only comes off as a presumptuous display. The first few seconds of the first real song, Pillars of Serpents, is so gutwrenchingly dull and contrived that a listener with some sense of music will feel as if he or she died a little inside. The album does not get any better from this point, assaulting the ears with an orgy of dull riffing, lackluster drumlines and so much predictable song composition that you basically need only to hear one song and you have heard the entire CD. The album ends with A View of Burning Empires, another instrumental, yet by this point your spirit has been so beaten and broken from the outrageously unoriginal barrage of shit that all you really want to do is turn it off and proceed using it as a coaster.\n\nThe only reason why this album gets any points is because the band at least knows how to play their instruments. Of course, bees know how to sting and we don't like them any more because of it. If paint-by-number metal gets you hot under the collar, this album won't disappoint. However, if you have even the slightest modicum of good taste, save your money and your time. For what this album grants, you can get the same - if not better - entertainment from your wall.\n"
