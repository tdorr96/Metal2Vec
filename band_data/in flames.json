        "\nI've already said that In Flames won't return to their roots. However, this single leaves me so conflicted and weirded out. On the one hand, it's nice to finally see and hear some effort put into the music after so long. On the other hand, it also feels very wrong. Also, something tells me that this may be just a ploy to get us to buy their new album once it comes out, only to be disappointed once more. Anyway, the final result is uncanny valley, as the title states.\n\nI have to admit, the main riff, even if it sounds too much like the main riff in Blinded by Fear, is a welcome change of pace in comparison to what's been written and played on the previous couple of albums. However, it also made me think of so many bands who did this better. Not only that, but it also just feels weird and uncanny after a long string of crappy albums. Maybe it's because I expected more of the same crap, I don't know. The bass is hard to hear, what more is there to say? At least the drums don't stick to the same patterns all throughout the track, but they're nothing spectacular. In fact, the production also plays a role in the uncanny valley that this single is. Melodic death metal, if that's what they were going for here, is not supposed to sound sterile. This reminded me of Come Clarity, which in itself is uncanny valley for a couple of reasons, but at least it was supposed to be metalcore and not melodic death metal, so that kind of softens the blow.\n\nAfter so many years of what we all know by now, Anders finally giving a shit sounds like a dream come true, right? In theory, yes, of course it does, but in practice? Not quite. On the one hand, it IS a relief to hear him actually growl. Even his screams and cleans don\u2019t sound nearly as bad as they could get. In fact, he sounds legitimately frustrated and pissed off at times. And yet, whatever he does, it never sounds fully right, there's always an element of something fundamentally wrong with the vocals. I don't know if it's him just not having what it takes anymore or studio manipulation which, if present, is discrete in comparison to some of their (slightly) earlier work, but there's always something off about them on this single. It's better than a lot of their relatively recent material, but still...\n\nI hope that I'll be proven wrong with their new album because being cynical is actually not as easy as it may seem at first glance. However, something still tells me that, at best, we'll get more of this uncanny valley. Still, I'll take it over Battles (which was atrocious) and I, the Mask (which was so lackluster that it's not worth reviewing or even giving a shit about) any day. At least it's not a trainwreck, as weird as it may be coming from me, I'll give it that.\n",
        "\n...the comparatively banal sunny ecstasy that would follow in the later albums. Another perspective: this is a beacon of original melo-death warmth before the coming winter of a lifeless, formatted scene; which, ironically, this very band partially contributed to firmly establish. It's most probably not the greatest metal album of the decade but its intentions were pure. There's that heroic heart at the center of every track on here. It's honest in that it lives for the musical representation of gracefulness with its myriad of embellishing muse-like leads, through an aesthetic infatuated with the epic and an edifying spirit of nobility that's unrelenting with verve and passion. A bit of what goes on here can be found in sequences off 'Far Away from the Sun' (Sacramentum), Dissection's 'Storm of the Light's Bane' and that whole scene. \n\nAlthough both those records generally feel less drunk with melodic harmonies, and were possibly deeper works, there is indeed that same atmospheric momentum to the rhythms and that lift in the leads. Also that borderline black metal vocal style, along with the odd acoustic break... ultimately, it's that same first wave, 1996-ish Swedish scene with bands cultivating the artful concept of nocturnal luminescence; that half-light/semi-darkness vibe, very pertinently characterized by the tight-knit collaboration of minor and major. One concave interlocked into the convexity of the other.\n\nIt's a bit interesting. At various points while experiencing this record, it might dawn on someone there's a naive quality to this music. After all, it is power metal with a slightly darker production and screams rather than operatic singing; roughly put; so a lot of that \"dungeons and dragons\" fantasy element is in this. Sometimes, one could almost hear that metal version of Zelda fighting off mythical creatures in the forest energy. There's that lively swinging motion in the rhythms, reminiscent of folk European music only printed onto a harsher and more abrasive texture. The balance in mood is quite peculiar, as the songs are almost all written in minor with a core at very least melancholic if not grievous at times; but with the standard harmonizing, a brighter and more optimistic drive joins the initial impetus of the tracks in a parallel symbiosis, that can almost be confusing at times (sad ? joyful ?) but generally brings about a distinct feeling of exhilaration. \n\nThis record is of course one of the influential ones for its style. It had to be, being melo-death royalty In Flames' second full length. A prototype of the \"techno-riff\" that would become so popular in later iterations of melo-death can be found on the second half of 'Dead Eternity'. You know the kind: bass-high/bass-high bass-high/bass-high, or mbizzum mbizzum mbizzum mbizzum. What this sophomore effort lacks that the debut had, is an ability to combine an overall aesthetic with memorable musical themes. It's a case of the album being better in theory than it is in one's headphones, tangibly song after song. This feels more evolved, bigger... but also more mild. This band has always had a tendency of lacking a bit of a backbone, undeniably being among the softer bands in that Swedish scene, and that tendency didn't at all exist on the previous 'Lunar Strain' but starts to show here. The albums would gradually lose more and more depth, and of that poetic element, turning to a brighter and more mainstream format with every release.\n",
        "\nTwo years ago I wrote a scathing review about how immensely pitiful the 2020 EP version of this record turned out. A hideous re-recording of one of the most infamous melodic death metal records ever, released by the perhaps most divisive metal band of the 90s and 2000s.\n\nToday, there is nothing divisive about this formation anymore, since most of us generally agree upon the fact that In Flames took a turn for the worst later on but let's go back to one of their most discussed albums because Clayman depicts the proverbial landmine, where the general consent among listeners keeps falling apart in every single discussion since its original release.\n\nIs this the record where Anders Fr\u00edden truly started experimenting with his awkward, oddly irritating high-pitched \"harsh\" vocals? Yes, indeed. Is this the record where In Flames threw themselves into the sewers of the scene to never return again? Not yet, not quite! Shoving nostalgia aside (which is not entirely possible, I gotta admit that), Clayman is still the crowning moment of their lengthy career. There have been genre-defining elements and tracks on all of their previous releases (and about zero on their post-2000 output), but this opus here is the melting pot of all their trademarks, showcased in a cohesive 45 minute package without any weak songs.\n\nWith the predecessor Colony already foreshadowing what was to come with Clayman (a beefier, brighter production job, some reluctant use of clean and spoken word vocals, keyboards, immensely more powerful drumming) there shouldn't have been so many surprise elements for the initiated. Expanding on the groundwork of their previous creation, the experimentation within the boundaries of the Gothenburg sound had reached a kind of climax, resulting in some of the catchiest hook-driven heavy music there is without compromise in the songwriting aspects. No, Clayman is not complex, proggy melodeath with sophisticated, intricate rhythm structuring and yadda-yadda-yadda...it's just a very unique form of metal that immediately plants its seeds deep into your skull like the most assertive of pop music, but without the shallowness of many fetid acts in said scene. Why that remains to be a point of concern to many or even a bad thing at all is beyond my understanding. \n\nIf you managed to avoid this album (why would you?) until the present day, \"Satellites and Astronauts\", \"Pinball Map\" and \"Square Nothing\" remain perfectly representative songs for the uniqueness of the band in this era. Despite the massive growth of melodic death metal and respective trend-following bands in the first half of the 00s, I'm still hard-pressed to find any material that sounds truly similar to the weird power ballad in space-like adventure of \"Satellites...\", which is perhaps the most original song these guys ever wrote and features one of Fr\u00edden's (few) finest \"nu-style\" shriek performances (+ a perfect chorus to boot) and one of their most beautiful guitar solos ever. \"Pinball Map\" has got the heaviest chugs and utmost thrashiness of their entire career with another perfect chorus and a bridge section that will turn your neck into apple sauce. \"Square Nothing\" compares the urgency of the latter with the spacey balladry of the former and wins through the impressive combination of the two extremes. If these songs don't grab you in any way...well, that's also beyond my understanding. \n\nPeople who hated this when it came out more than two decades ago might remain hostile towards this album in 2022, but I'm still waiting for melodic death metal material to come out that's actually stronger, more creative and simply better entertainment than either Dark Tranquility's Projector or - yes, indeed - Clayman. \n\noriginally written for http://antichristmagazine.com\n",
        "\nAlong with \"The Jester Race\" and \"Whoracle\", \"Clayman\" is one of In Flames' most famous and respected cds. A year after the somewhat conservative but still nice \"Colony\", Jesper Str\u00f6mblad's group decided to go further than ever and plunge into the mainstream completely, i.e. move away from melo-death sounds (although it would require large quotation marks) in favor of those tailored to radio standards. The mission, of course, succeeded and made quite an impression (after all, they got into a year with it), because despite so many radical changes, the Swedes from In Flames achieved even greater success than on their previous albums, and thus gained a much larger popularity.\n\nCommercial success is one thing, and a compositional success is another. And interestingly, both of these things...occur to some extent on \"Clayman\"! Well, the fifth album of In Flames is an album - as time has shown - quite influential on followers of smoothed melo-death (which is a bit of an oxymoron) or - later - metalcore and, ironically, an album composed without excessive pump and loading of melodies without thinking. Well, \"Clayman\" is simply a professionally prepared product for the masses in a metal genre. However, listening to this product is not too bad, as exemplified by \"Satellites And Astronauts\", \"Square Nothing\", \"Bullet Ride\", \"...As The Future Repeats Today\" or \"Suburban Me\", in which the melodies are quite sublime, the gentleness is within the limits of decency and the band serves various themes that give the songs a separate character. Okay, in some songs it also happens that Swedes bend over and put too much emphasis on melodiousness; fortunately, it does not break up the consistency of the whole disc and this dose of sugar is degistable without bigger problems. In spite of a very clear tendency to the most polite varieties of metal, the fifth album of In Flames is not one of those that only target radio choruses or want to satisfy the irregular listeners.\n\nSo, with the release of \"Clayman\", there was a whole new times for In Flames. After years of gradual softening of sounds, Jesper Str\u00f6mblad's group decided to dive into much lighter and very mainstream metal all over, i.e. with a residual amount of melo-death elements. On the \"Clayman\" times, yes, it made sense, on the next albums, not necessarily.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/10/in-flames-clayman-2000.html\n",
        "\nAh shit, here we go again.\n\nIt's time for new In Flames material. I'll spare you the boredom of rehashing the band's stylistic history and the reactions to it because you've already read that in every other modern In Flames review. Rather, let's focus on what this single is: a surprisingly speedy and, well, metal song. According to recent stage banter from singer Anders Friden, this is the first single from an upcoming album, the title not known as of right now. It was created during the COVID-19 pandemic and is supposed to be inspired by the state of the world during said pandemic. Well, if In Flames' previous history with surface-level social commentary (\"This Is Our House\") and this single says anything, it's that this doesn't sound like a promising project. \n\nHearing this for the first time may come as a shock to one familiar with modern In Flames. It sees the band going into a surprisingly high gear that they seldom achieve in their current form. The riff-to-strum ratio is way higher than usual. Even as he nears 50, Anders' growls are still incredibly strong. It actually sounds like they're playing melodic death metal once more, and that's what everyone wants, right? Return to form complete, right? Redemption time! Not quite. \n\nAfter the ugly, stomping, Siren Charms-like riff that opens the song is over, we're greeted with the main verse riff, which bears so much similarity to that of At the Gates' Blinded by Fear that it's safe to call it a rip-off. Aside from that and the surprising speed, the rest of the song is typical modern In Flames. There's nothing else surprisingly novel about it, and even over its 4-minute runtime, it doesn't present many ideas. The mixing is typical homogenous sanitized modern metal. The second half of the song is essentially the first half copied and pasted with only half a verse's worth of new lyrics. A few semi-original and semi-good sounding harmonized riffs pop up, the drums periodically go into a half-time groove for maximum pump-your-fist-in-the-air energy, Bj\u00f6rn plays a brief, cheesy solo with Kirk Hammett levels of wah, and the chorus devolves into strummed chords with a clean vocal melody from Anders. Oh, Anders, after over 20 years of doing it, you still haven't accepted that you can't sing. And then the song ends. I've gotten nothing from it. \n\nThe sad thing about a higher energy In Flames song like this in modern times is that even when they kick things into high gear, they still fail to capture their old energy and uniqueness. They don't even manage to come up with a new, exciting kind of energy and uniqueness. Each In Flames album since Clayman has had at least one obligatory fast song that superficially resembles their old work with its speed and riff-to-strum ratio, but it's never representative of the overall sound of the album it appears on and is always underwhelming. I really believe that this is the best that modern In Flames can do, and it's still not satisfying. Part of it might be Howard Benson's continued producer role, based on an interview in which he stated that he pushed In Flames to go for a more mainstream and vocal-driven sound. And we all know how that turned out. The piles of suck that were I, the Mask and (shudder) Battles. Or, you know, In Flames might have just found a style they're comfortable with and are going through the motions at this point. I've mentioned in at least one previous review that one of my biggest problems with some legacy acts is that they don't know when to quit after they've run out of usefulness. In Flames is fast approaching that stage, and might even already be there unless the rest of the upcoming album is a complete fluke and dazzles me.\n",
        "\nI'll be completely honest from the start: I didn't even realize that In Flames was putting out a single, and I wasn't checking for one. It happened to pop up in my YouTube feed, and I am at least happy for that. That being said, this single leaves me very confused and incredibly conflicted. On one hand, I never actually thought that they would lean more towards the death/core side of things than the melodic side, which many have wanted for a long time. Does it lack the charisma that usually comes with the melodic side of In Flames? Yeah, but it does have some for simply being different from the rest of their catalogue, the catchiness of it, and weirdly enough, Anders' vocals. \n\nUnfortunately, his mid screams barely miss out on being high-pitched enough or raspy enough for me to  really  love them, but he employs deeper growls that have a nice impact to them. His clean vocals are the least prominent of what he does, and are simply relegated to a more understated clean chorus for an In Flames song. The chorus is very much like the one from \"Bottled\", but it fits the song far better, the song surrounding it is a lot better, and it's not a closing track. In a way, I'd say that this track replaces any purpose that song (On its own, not in the context of STYE) had for me, not that every song necessarily  needs  a reason to exist in a band's discography. I've always loved how the band changes so much with the passing of time to keep fans on their toes and to provide a ton of variety in their discography. While I don't think their experimentation is as creative or genius as I'd like (Something like Ihsahn sets the standard for me, admittedly), it's undeniable that they've done a ton of experimenting over their discography, with Battles being their only work that I've felt is insincere.\n\nThe guitarwork goes for something heavier, and admittedly, the opening did get me very hopeful... At least until I realized that 1. Yeah, it's eerily similar to \"Blinded By Fear\" by At the Gates\u2014 Which I know it's bound to happen that you get something similar to what someone's already done, but damn, that was something done by one of your two biggest peers on their peak work, which is generally seen as one of the peaks of the subgenre. 2. I prefer the more melodic take of \"Enter Tragedy\"'s riff (They're somewhat similar, let me make the analogy), and 3. The solo is pretty much the standard fare for Bjorn, but marginally better. I hate his usage of high pitched notes, wah, and vibrato (I don't hate them in general, just the combination that Bjorn tends to do). Granted, there are actually a quite a few positives of the track guitar-wise. that there is some really nice, blackened-feeling tremolo picking, which is something that I've basically just resigned to associating with Anaal Nathrakh at this point. As I said previously, I love how different it is to 90% of the band's catalogue, even when comparing it to I, the Mask. On a macro level, yes, the general subgenre and instrument tones are the same, but I think that comes with the musicians in the respective time period. That being said, on a songwriting level, the actual style (Moreso in regards to feel and composition, rather than subgenre) is rather different than most of their works. The easiest comparison to make is that it feels like a fully-realized version of \"Burn\", another song by the band which was clearly made as a statement as well. \"State of Slow Decay\" is an evident high-octane thrasher, due to both the guitars and the drums.\n\nSpeaking of the drums, thank fucking God. I haven't felt this excited about the band's drumwork since Svensson was in the band. I know, two albums isn't that much, but the last album that Svensson was on was in 2014, which was very nearly a decade before this track. Wayne does a fucking phenomenal job here, delivering equally precise and technical drumming that feels blistering and exciting, rather than mechanical. As much as I like Joe Rickard as a drummer and as much as his more modern rock style still lent well to the music that In Flames put out the time, it almost feels like the material that the band did write or could've written was held back by his slower, more controlled pacing. I love his work in Red, but In Flames feels free to go all out with Wayne at the helm. As for the bass... I'm not sure what you want me to say, it's competent, but inaudible. Everything I expected from a Howard Benson and In Flames production, even if the mixing and mastering were helmed by different people. Ultimately, the call does come from inside the house.\n\nI know I ripped on this song a bit, but it's a grower that actually does seem like a glimmer of hope for many fans. Make no mistake: This isn't the best thing that the band's done since 2008 nor a return to form, and I'm so fucking sick of seeing those comments on  everything  the band puts out. Yes, Jesper left then and this sounds inspired, I get it, but the people who say that always sound so fucking braindead because it's a rehashed praise that goes along the same lines of those who bitch that A Sense of Purpose was the last good In Flames album. I'm not saying that your opinion is subjectively wrong, but you're a fucking idiot if you don't elaborate, and those kinds of people tend to not elaborate and just leave the easy comment seemingly for people to like or upvote the bullshit. Do I think that a more melodeath/harder metalcore style lend themselves well to In Flames' modern sound? Hell no. It's just too clean and too grizzled in the all the ways that melodeath isn't, and not nearly as grizzled in the ways that melodeath should be. Anders' mid screams, which are the main vocals here, have a scratchiness to them that I do like, but they lack the fullness to give that proper impact. Bjorn's guitar sound and composition style are both far too modern to me as well. I hate the possibility of a sterile, modern melodic death metal sound, and I'd rather them forge a new path than to bastardize their old one\u2014They  already  did that with the Clayman re-recordings. That isn't to say that any of that in this paragraph is necessarily a bad thing, and if anything, I think they  almost  did as good of a job as they could with this one. It's a significant step up in all of the areas that typically show weakness or cliches in the band's modern catalogue (Save for the solos, that one's in the bin with the rest). I actually do hope that they do have a couple songs that are just as alt metal as those in I, the Mask, but if they want to go for a sound more akin to the genres they helped to spawn, I'm happy to go along with the ride. I have such a fierce admiration for the band's determination to constantly evolve, success or otherwise, that admittedly doesn't shine through enough in my reviews. Each album has such a distinct feel that it's difficult for listens to them to get stale unless you're just sick of the sound they have as musicians. They sound even more reinvigorated than the step in the right direction with I, the Mask, and if anything, although they're being much more serious and real with the message of the song, they sound like they're having a ton of fun as musicians again, which was something I just haven't felt since 2006's Come Clarity. Sounds of a Playground Fading may have been an inspired highlight to me, but it also wasn't quite as fun or bouncy as Come Clarity. And hey, if they're having fun and still keeping fans on their toes, I'm all for what the band wants to do. I think the day that In Flames dies is the day they go stagnant and the flame burns out, or the day that they do something as abysmal as Battles. I'd like to believe that the darkness of those days are long behind us.\n",
        "\nA prototype of early melodic death metal, 'Lunar Strain' takes a completely different route to any other musical field that existed at the time. This genre In Flames were instrumental in shaping, along with a handful of bands, would seize the poetic lore of melody and cast it straight into the inferno. What came out of that is a blend of heaviness; thick and aggressive; emulsified into the airy frolic of traditional song. An almost awkward result, intelligible and coherent nonetheless, that would leave its mark on the metal scene, probably indelibly. This album in particular feels like it swings between hot and cold. On one hand the sections will build on an energy exhibiting a kind of folk-spirited cheerfulness; both rhythmically (1-2-3, 1-2-3 swinging waltzes) and melodically (perpetual harmonization). On the other hand, a lot of the material is strongly oriented towards the graver, weightier expression of sorrow, and this debut effort feels among one of the slowest in the band's discography. That cohabitation of major and minor makes the record; both constantly feeding off each other in what surely feels like a collaboration rather than competition between both extremes.\n\nThe guitars are surprisingly abrasive here when they would turn a lot smoother on later releases, firmly planting this record in the death metal domain, however melodic it is. There's a rough sound to it, and it is both hospitable with its beauty and yet slightly inaccessible in that it is still grounded in a genre at least affiliated with extreme metal. A solemn feel to the melodies and plain harmonies, corroborated by the languishing lyrics, depicts a rather bare manifestation of poetry through music. It's interesting and rare enough to bring up, that a melo-death band from the early 90's would choose a sci-fi centered brand of existentialism as its main aesthetic to introduce itself to the world. It juxtaposes the trad element with futuristic fantasy, giving it that peculiar flavor. The first lines of the title-track read:\n\"For there is a purpose and reason - Beyond all human apprehension - The shrieking silence in the blackness of space\nFor there is a knowledge more complex - Than life on this planet - A knowledge in tune with the progress of stars\".\n\nThe songs are given a prog format with regular changes between parts as the album does well avoiding redundancy at that level, and every song tells its own story, containing at least one riff/section the listener will be anticipating, all the way down to the tenth track and that sticky main riff in pure classic melo-death tradition. It does come across as overly melodic in parts, but contrary to the later stuff, this is balanced out by that sought out purity and a prevailing mid-pace, not rushing the listener the way the later scene would do with its attention-seeking poppy derivations and uninterrupted speed. That desire for majesty here is symbolized by the track 'Everlost Part II' and its subtle yet powerful female singing performance by one of the session guests, as one example. What's more the acoustic guitars although fairly generic, bring their own organic texture, added to the violins and their gracefulness in minor scale, notably on the instrumental 'H\u00e5rgal\u00e5ten' (and its very cool-sounding merging of violins and saturated guitars); which as an aside is a Swedish legend of \"the devil disguised as a fiddler and the youngsters in the village of H\u00e5rga he made dance themselves to death\". \n\nBack to that word: gracefulness. The band were definitely reaching for a state of grace on here in some form, almost like the rocking motions of the perpetually harmonized riffs; steady, purposely made simple and straightforward; could bring about something like an inner-peace, amidst the more tumultuous sections and the sharper edges they reintroduce into the songs every now and then. Parts like the main riffs to 'Lunar Strain' and to the instrumental 'Dreamscape' illustrate with brio that spirit of exaltation, as if they described the epic journey of the Hero in some archetypal way. The role of the bass is central, emulating Iron Maiden of course, and it will sometimes appear easily too loud in the mix, but its presence is understandable as with music so reliant on both guitars playing a lead role, the bass remains the one root foundation for everything else to work from. And perhaps the blues-styled solo licks could've been avoided as they might skew the plain artistry on display with their over-the-top rock attitude. This isn't the album of the century but it's home to a few remarkable melodies and its textural wealth between the contributions of various guests mounted into a solid main unit, combined with the aura of a classic record it possesses and that \"home-made\" production give it that strong character and inevitably, a historical significance that isn't negligible.\n",
        "\nIn my 80 or so reviews I've always done the same thing, when I decide which album I'm going to talk about I save it as a draft and keep it in my reviews until I finally manage to develop what I want to say in the review itself. There has only been one time where I have had to delete the album from my reviews because I was unable to capture what I wanted to say, and that is this In Flames album.\n\nWell, I do know what I want to say, which is that I don't understand what is the appeal of this album in general, I know that the relevance of In Flames would come with their follow-up album to this one, but even today I see high expectations for news of the three members of this album making a new band together and it's not only that I don't understand why some people value this album highly, but I also don't understand what was the goal of this album itself.\n\nThe first thing I thought when I listened to this album was: \"Why are there so many folkloric segments?\" (or melodic in the case of \"Everlost (Part II)\"). I don't see this as a tendency that In Flames would continue or something that benefits the rest of the music precisely, it''s not in conjunction with the music but feels more like an addition to give more substance to the album. And I can't help but think about the comparison with At The Gates' debut, where they did the same thing two years earlier, plus their compatriots did make it work, firstly because it served as a contrast to the creative and crazy songwriting on the album and secondly because the sound of those folk parts sounded dirty and gave it a unique characteristic, here it just sounds like filler without anything else.\n\nOverall it is an album that I feel offers a lot in a very short time but most of it is not fully developed, when the album works best is with the melodic songs where they have time and space to develop a theme full of riffs and good musical technique, \"Behind Space\" \"Starforsaken\" and especially the impeccable \"In Flames\" are the ones that undoubtedly best represent this facet, moving between heavier segments and others of softer tonality and never losing the adaptive capacity along the whole composition, the guitar work is without any doubt more than remarkable and I would say that the biggest attraction of the album, there are melodies and riffs that without any doubt will stay in your head for a while, and although many times the songs try to be not very intuitive the truth is that they are easily memorable because even with all that surrounds them the halo of simplicity doesn't disappear, in a good way of course.\n\nBut unfortunately this part doesn't represent 100% of the album, there are many parts that seem to be more filler that doesn't add anything to the rest of the musicality, I already mentioned those folkloric segments but I can also say the same about the instrumental \"Dreamscape\" that although technically correct feels rather like an improvisation as the song doesn't seem to reach a conclusion. Also the album ends with the extremely short \"Upon an Oaken Throne\" and \"Clad in Shadows\" which being more aggressive and simple, don't reach the level of the above mentioned songs as good examples, not that they are bad but they seem a bit out of tune (not in vain there is nothing else on the rest of the album that sounds like that) and they also seem to be added in order to put some more content to the album.\n\nAnd this is in itself I think the biggest anchor of In Flames' debut, an album that has some great quality tracks followed by a lot of filler that delivers but doesn't excite the listener. I don't know if there were reasons for pretentiousness but I can't help but think that, even if for real all the songs on the album are the ones the band initially wanted to include, and that they are all delivered in the specific way the band wanted to include them and there is no filler whatsoever. The album could have been fixed if the song order had been changed. This is something that if one stops to think about it happens to many, many albums, but this is one of the biggest examples I can think of. The two tracks at the end should have been placed in the middle of the album and separated from each other, perhaps separated by \"Dreamscape\" to serve as a counterpoint, and the track \"In Flames\" should have been the second to last track to be followed by \"H\u00e5rgal\u00e5ten\" to emphasize the folk music value of the album.\n\nI know it's easy to talk like this about an album without having participated in the creative process, but it's this kind of details that, at first sight don't seem to have so much importance, the ones that then determine the subjective perception that each one of us has of a work, maybe for others this album works perfectly the way it is, but for me this album can't be seen in any other way than as one that simply performs and nothing more.\n",
        "\nThe slightly lower popularity of \"Colony\" is due to a fairly simple fact. Well, the fourth lp from In Flames was placed between the much more popular \"Whoracle\" and \"Clayman\", and in fact it did not bring such changes to the whole discography of the Swedes (there will be time for that in next years). 2 years between \"Colony\" and the previous album, the band just took care of the more melodies, some non-metal influences and fun with the sounds - no madness, but not too much like \"Whoracle\" patterns. At that time, the band also experienced a lot of line-up changes, i.e. guitarist Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m and bassist Johan Larsson left the band, Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte switched to guitar entirely, and bassist Peter Iwers and drummer Daniel Svensson joined the group. And that's how In Flames formed one of the most solid lineups the band has ever had. \n\nOn \"Colony\" there was - as I mentioned - even more space for prettier melodies (often played clean), electronic insertions, rock heaviness, keyboard inserts (e.g. piano in \"Ordinary Story\" and hammonds in the title track - both ideas very successful) or even clean vocals (for example in \"Insipid 2000\" and \"Coerced Coexistence\"). Surprisingly, \"Colony\" it's not listened to badly. First of all, the \"novelties\" are not exaggerated here, and the dose of sweetness has been quite sensibly balanced in them - hence the spoiler why I like \"Colony\" more than its predecessor, when you look at the rating. Besides, \"Colony\" does not humanly overwhelm with indulgence melodies and listens to it without embarrassment, more so than the repeatedly mentioned \"Whoracle\". The remake of \"Behind Space\" from \"Lunar Strain\" (here with the note '99) is also good, in which the spirit of the original is well preserved, and at the same time it's nicely given a more \"zoomer\" feel. \n\nAmong those late In Flames albums that do not make your earache, \"Colony\" is one of the last quite passable albums from these Swedes. It's still hard to say that this longplay is amazing, although you have to admit that for a very mild melo-death \"Colony\" looks quite impressive. Especially if you don't listen to it very often.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/10/in-flames-colony-1999.html\n",
        "\nThe new, mostly simplified logo is the first of the serious signals associated with softening or general \"betrayal of ideals\". Well, in the case of \"Whoracle\" such a theory holds up because...these gentlemen have almost always been far from the dictionary concept of extreme metal! From the perspective of \"The Jester Race\", you can quickly come to the conclusion (after the first track) that the Swedes on their third album did not go too far from the previous style. Actually, they extended it with quite standard (especially later) elements for this genre, i.e. more melodiousness and hitness. In view of In Flames itself, of course, these changes came into another great commercial success. I myself, from \"Whoracle\", started to be more clingy about their cds - which for some people will be a surprise that from now. \n\nAs I mentioned, the music on the \"Whoracle\" does not stand out so much from that from \"The Jester Race\", although in some respects it seems to be a bit overdone. What distinguishes it from the previous two albums is mainly the less rough sound of guitars, a delicate expansion of the vocals (with two voice tracks and lower, spoken) and more Scandinavian (fortunately, based on \"traditional\" metal instruments) and heavy metal melodies. Only this, although despite this modesty, but quite softening and with a predominance of much lighter climates. And yes, melodies or heavy metal rhythms are not bad to themselves, but the problem is that there are far too many of them on \"Whoracle\". To put it simply, the contrast between the heavier and more melodious sides of In Flames has almost completely disappeared here. Something that was much less of an issue before. \n\nThe most important for In Flames at that time was to create catchy, melodic and undemanding songs. In this respect, \"Whoracle\" offers a lot of pretty tracks like \"The Hive\", quasi-symphonic \"Worlds Within The Margin\", cool but acoustic \"Jester Script Transfigured\" and quite fast for them \"Morphing Into Primal\" or \"Food For The Gods\". On the downside, certainly the length of the disc and - which is related to it - a lot of fatigue at the end (especially in the title track and cover of Depeche Mode \"Everything Counts\") and the aforementioned several times melodiousness. Without these elements (or better balancing them), the third album by Jesper Str\u00f6mblad's band could have evoked much more interesting feelings. \n\nSo in \"Whoracle\" I see the beginning of the end of In Flames. With its release, it has become most clearly visible, as for Swedes, the emphasis on melodies and attracting less and less demanding listeners are the most important. At the beginning (i.e. until \"Clayman\") they still kept the style, but not enough to fully like this direction.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/10/in-flames-whoracle-1997.html\n",
        "\nIt's weird seeing so many people, including people who hate all of In Flames' newer efforts, defend this album so vehemently. It's weird seeing so many 60-80% reviews here. It's weird so many rankings and tier lists of In Flames albums putting this album in the upper echelon. Frankly speaking, I just don't feel the hype that so many people have for this album- And I say this as someone whose favorite band is In Flames, as someone who somehow enjoyed Siren Charms and sadly regards Battles as a guilty pleasure on rare occasions. I guess that A Sense of Purpose is like that in a way for me. Every time I feel like complete and utter shit, I end up *really* enjoying this album, and I guess I have to thank it for always helping me to wake up and try to do what I can to feel better about everything in life... But that's because I hate that I enjoy just how aggravatingly emo this album is. Mind you, I don't *usually* hate things that are emo simply because they're emo. Hell, a lot of music that I enjoy is rather edgy and whiny. I guess the thing for me is that In Flames just does it really horribly to me, and that's just because it's so basic and in your face. They get poetic with it here and there, and in those cases, I can excuse it, as the band actually does something interesting with it, but that's mostly relegated to the front half of the album.\n\nI'm going to break my usual procedure for reviewing and just say which songs I love and hate first. I actually love the choruses in every song, regardless of if I love them or hate them. Those feel like the one thing that they knew exactly what they were going for in every song, though in the weaker songs, it feels like they wrote around the choruses and did a rather shit job at connecting the verses to them. The stretch from \"The Mirror's Truth\" to \"Alias\" is fucking fantastic, and if they kept up with this quality for the whole album, I might've actually enjoyed it in its entirety. \"Move Through Me\" is another highlight on the album, and I actually love how uplifting and sort of RPG-tinged its lyrics are. That being said, \"Delights and Angers\" is such a shallow attempt at a single, \"Sober and Irrelevant\" has very little to offer outside of its chorus, and \"Drenched in Fear\" is a fucking Battles song in the style of this album. Every other song is mid for one reason or another, but I don't listen to them too often just because I find that I really have to be in one of two specific moods in order to enjoy them.\n\nAnd that's the issue for me. I'm aware that it's a bit of a me problem, yes, but when your general qualities are something that I generally dislike and find bad, that's what I'm going to say. However, I think some more objective problems I have with the album is that it just feels far too close to Come Clarity, regardless of how emo the lyrics are, they're rather poor for In Flames' standards and are probably the band's weakest outing there yet, the vocals are, for the most part (As someone who almost always defends Anders), a mix of raspy and weak that really doesn't work. I don't mind his rougher vocals at all- In fact, they're incredibly enjoyable in Sounds of a Playground Fading, but that's because they aren't as weak as they are here. Anders seriously needed to project his voice more, and if he couldn't... That's a very real issue. His clean vocals, although rather poor to me here, work rather well with the material here, and for that, I can excuse them. The worst part about his vocals though? The fact that his growls here are fucking awesome, but he uses them so little that it generally leaves little impact. I know using them a majority of the time wouldn't quite fit with the material as well as his screams here, but I find them to be a lot better both objectively and subjectively.\n\nThe guitars here focus more on melodies than Come Clarity, at the cost of heaviness and power. While the melodies are generally accessible and enjoyable, they (Compounded by the vocals and lyrics, unfortunately) just don't leave much of an impression on me. Considering that In Flames is a band who is rather driven by powerful melodies, there's pretty big competition here, and most of the melodies here... Aren't powerful or notable. Make no mistake, the leads are usually pretty damn good in the choruses, but when half of the songs have completely forgettable verses, something's seriously wrong. In fact, I think that's the album's biggest issue. The songs generally feel built around the choruses, and most of them have rather mediocre verses. While \"The Chosen Pessimist\" is too long for its own good, it is nothing short of beautiful otherwise, with a buildup that feels natural and works incredibly. I think that's why its so special: It feels like a proper journey as a song. It feels like it was built from the ground up, and thus the epic scope of it feels justified, earned, and real. As much as I hate to say it though, like the vocals and lyrics, the guitars also occasionally fall into many cliches that emo/alt metal music has.\n\nThe drumming here is nothing short of phenomenal. This is probably one of Svensson's best performances as a whole, as for me, its the most memorable and powerful part of every song here, even the filler tracks. I always find so much variety in what he does on the album, with him utilizing every part of the kit to great effect. There's always something on every track that wows me, even on repeat listens, and I can't really say that all too often. It goes to prove exactly why he's my favorite drummer ever, though it only goes to further expose the core issues for me. If the most memorable part of around half of your songs are the fucking drums, you either have a serious problem or one of the best drummers in existence. Unfortunately, I'd say it's both in this case. The bass exists here too. It's audible enough, sounds good enough, but there's nothing special to say about it. I hate to say it, but yeah, considering everything else the album aims for, I think it makes sense for the style to see the bass get completely neglected.\n\nSmall note, but although the production is rather good and clean for the most part, there are a bunch of rough spots and cuts that are seriously amateurish. A prime example is how the guitars fade in at 2:17 of \"The Mirror's Truth\". How did the entire production and mixing team (Including the band) miss this? However, these are just nitpicks, and I find the production to be pretty great as a whole.\n\nI'm aware that I've done about as much whining about this album as Anders does on the album, but I'm going to say some things I liked about the album. Again, the entirety of \"The Mirror's Truth\" is seriously awesome. In Flames generally puts their best foot forward for opening tracks, but this is probably their best opener of the newer catalogue. It continues in the intensity of Come Clarity, but the entire track's flourishes, melodies, and everything in between help to differentiate it enough to give it its own identity. Despite \"Disconnected\" having pretty emo lyrics, I think that (Aside from the chorus, which is a guilty pleasure) the lyrics are rather creatively done. The melodies here help to elevate the song in a way that I absolutely love too. The vocals work perfectly for these two songs, and generally don't lack in power, and both songs have a flow to them that isn't disrupted in the transition from the verses to choruses and vice versa, which was one of my biggest problems with the back half of the album. The acoustic section in \"Alias\" is serene and feels just like the acoustic of the band's older material. There's also a strange sort of wisdom to the lyrics in the edginess that is a bit tough to discern, but in the process of attempting to figure it out (Or read too far into it), I find it to be really enjoyable. \"I'm the Highway\" and \"Condemned\" are really starting to grow on me, the former for actually having a riff, and the latter for the chorus (Which sounds a frightening amount like the band's take on Disturbed) and the ending of the solo which screams Deafheaven before Deafheaven even existed. Yeah, it's a short part, but I love it nonetheless. Though I've been saving what I enjoy most about this album (At least pound for pound, anyways) for last: The synths. I know most people who have listened to the album would set me on fire for this take, as it's not even close to the first thing they'd think of as the best part of the album, but every time those synths kick in, I just fall in love with them. I don't think the album really *needed* any more melodies, as that's what the band decided to sacrifice every other good thing they had going for in the first place, but I'm so fucking glad that \u00d6rnkloo was here. The second verse on \"The Mirror's Truth\", the synth line after the chorus in \"Sleepless Again\", the chorus melody in \"Move Through Me\", the fucking backing synths in \"The Chosen Pessimist\" that scream Soundtrack to Your Escape (Particularly \"Discover Me Like Emptiness\"), the synths that actually sound like strings, the weird spacey synths that remind me of Blood Stain Child (Notably \"Void\" and \"Nuclear Trance\")... Although I tend to forget about them after some time, they always feel so wonderful to me in a way I can't explain. Yes, they're the least metal thing about this album, but they're so undeniably wonderful to me. I can't help but gush about them because hearing them just makes me happy, which is truly special in the context of an album whose entire vibe and tone makes me feel really shitty otherwise. \n\nYes, this is one of those albums for people who feel like shit, I get it. Emo and hardcore albums are generally made with the purpose of helping listeners either find comfort in not being alone, or with the purpose of giving them a metaphorical shovel to help them dig themselves out with. However, there's generally substance to the feel that they have. Music that's generally considered emo, at its best, isn't so one-dimensional, and looking into the lyrics or the band's members help to develop a story, a reason, and an understandability that, in a way, helps one to feel like there's someone who gets it. Aside from Jesper's alcoholism, there just isn't anything there for me. Sometimes the lyrics have reason, deeper meaning, and even some wisdom (\"Disconnected\", \"Alias\", \"The Chosen Pessimist\"), but that just isn't there, for the most part. Similarly, music that's generally considered hardcore, at its best, generally has a bit of a barrier of entry with its screaming, but past that is a surprisingly positive and uplifting message that calls for the listener to get up and rise above the things that are keeping them down in a manner similar, yet usually more passively, to punk music (Which can be seen in \"I'm the Highway\" and \"Move Through Me\"). A Sense of Purpose, whose name has no bearing on the meaning of this album or vice versa, doesn't have any of that. And unlike Battles, which makes me feel like shit because the music itself is awful, ASoP generally makes me feel even worse because its lyrics are so unauthentically \"Everything feels horrible\" without any sort of substance or given reason. I'm aware that going too deep into things takes away from relatability, but I'd say it's worth sacrificing that for a sense of story. Funnily enough, for as filler of a song as \"Sober and Irrelevant\" is, it's lyrics are really fucking good. Sure, they're nothing seriously poetic, but they're incredibly human. If only they made the song worth listening to.\n\nOverall, to summarize the last paragraph, A Sense of Purpose, lyrically, has the opposite effect of its general archetype. Instead of helping to give a sense of comfort or helping one to feel better, it gives a feeling of depression that only digs the hole deeper, which makes me want to dig myself out of shitty feelings in a way that feels completely unintentional by the album. I guess you could say that it used the wrong formula to get the right answer, which I'd normally argue could be a good thing, but if I didn't have any desire to stop feeling like complete and utter shit, then this album would *only* end up making me feel worse and worse.\n\nAlthough that was the driving feeling I always had when listening to the album in high school, listening to the album now, given how much more music I've listened to, given the wisdom that comes with age (Even in the smallest amounts), and given the fact that I've trained my ear to focus more on the finer details in music, I've come to enjoy the music overall so much less than I used to. It used to at least have some modicum of heaviness and awe-inspiring melodies to me, but I've heard *much* heavier and *much* better shit since then (Deafheaven, Anaal Nathrakh, Endon, Thousand Eyes, Darkthrone, The Black Dahlia Murder, Harakiri For the Sky, etc.), and because of this, everything remarkable about the album? There wasn't much, but it's still just as good, I suppose. But everything that was less than remarkable? If it isn't mediocre, it's a fucking drag, and considering that I *don't* want to listen to music that is *both* shitty and makes me feel like shit, I don't think I'll *ever* listen to this album front to back again. You'd be more likely to catch me listening to Battles front to back again. In fact, whenever I sit down and rank the albums in my head or go to a tier list maker, yeah, this is always interchanged with STYE for my second-least favorite album. But honestly, after listening to the album front to back again for this review, I not only remember why I stopped doing so, I've finally made a decision on which album I like less. If anything, I think I owe STYE an apology.\n\nSo why is this album rated so highly? Well, as much as I wanted to slap a 40% on this and call it a day, there are more than enough awesome moments to bring the percentage up that much. The album as a whole is still pretty shit, but hey, it has its utterly phenomenal moments. I just wish they replaced some of the lesser songs with the ones from the The Mirror's Truth EP and just left them others as shitty bonus tracks. At that point, my rating would probably shoot up to 75-80% or so. Oh well.\n\nThe lists below were pretty tough to make since I try to be really strict about them. There were definitely a few more songs I felt like putting on the Avoid list, anyways.\n\nSongs To Recommend: \"The Mirror's Truth\", \"Disconnected\", \"Alias\", \"Move Through Me\"\nSongs To Avoid: \"Delights and Angers\", \"Sober and Irrelevant\", \"Drenched in Fear\"\n",
        "\nSoundtrack To Your Escape is a baffling album, I think we can all agree on that. It's the odd one out in the Stromblad era, and it's regarded as, well, the worst or least good, and depending on the day, I'd agree there. Hell, I'm not even sure that 60% is the appropriate rating, given how much is done well and how much is done completely abysmally. Firstly, it's a nu metal album... But also not really. It sounds like the band listened to nu metal and tried to copy it without understanding the little things that are special about the subgenre (Yes, there are some good things in nu metal, cry about it). I need to note that I grew up on nu metal, so yeah, I unfortunately have that in my blood and very much have a deep understanding of the sound. It seems more apt to say that it's more industrial, but I don't feel the staple sounds of that genre/subgenre either. What I will say is that the album appropriately, at least given the look of the album art, feels rather... Submarine. The echo-y drums, the scratchy, yet muddy guitars, the synths that (Especially given quite a few beeping lead synths) feel like what would be used for some sort of underwater level or scene. I'm really not sure that this was intended, as I don't quite think they were clever enough to really go for a drowning motif, but I love the atmosphere nonetheless.\n\nI need to rip into the album about one big thing first and foremost: For an album that feels like it's trying to go for a nu metal sound (Which is odd, given that it's 2004, fucking Limp Bizkit and nu metal as a whole lost its entire momentum with Results May Vary the year prior), it's fucking criminal to make the bass audible to a brief part of the opening track and nowhere else. At all. This isn't even hyperbole, unlike a lot of the reviews here. I decided to listen to STYE *twice* for this review: Once normally for the music, and once skimming through with bass boosted headphones. I *still* got nothing. Sure, it helps bring out the rhythm guitar when bass boosted, but that's very clearly the rhythm guitar. I *think* I heard the bass in \"Evil in a Closet\", but I feel like I'm fucking gaslighting myself. The playing also sounded like Iwers was on autopilot there, which just doesn't sound right. I'm pretty sure I heard the bass more in the Used & Abused live performances. Again, this is completely unacceptable if you're going for nu metal or end up with a nu metal sound, and I seriously have to wonder what Bergstrand, \u00d6rnkloo, and Anders were thinking. I could accept it being audible and not at the forefront of the mix. But frankly speaking, with all the other issues with the production here, this is a serious slap to the face.\n\nThe drumming is pretty good, and the kit actually sounds a bit better than I remember. Nothing much to say here. The guitars, meanwhile, are scratchy, muddy, and rough in ways that are all objectively horrible. The playing completely lacks any sort of technicality, with exception for a couple moments. When \"Dial 595-Escape\" has one of the most technical riffs on the album, that's a crisis situation. Not to mention, leads as a whole are pretty scarce, particularly on the back half of the album. But I'll give them some credit, the riffs here are a significant step up from Reroute to Remain. Sure, there's quite a bit of chugging in the verses, but it actually sounds interesting at times. Still, I'd say the guitarwork is a step down overall, and is probably the weakest in the band's entire discography. I'm not even going to qualify that statement by lambasting Siren Charms or Battles. Those at least had some degree of technicality at quite a few points.\n\nI'm not huge on the vocals here. Anders' screams sound weaker than they do on Reroute, but the cleans here sound good enough. In fact, Anders does some surprisingly awesome deep growls here and there. The issue here is that the album is dominated by the screams. The lyrics here, while competent and carrying the theme of the album rather well, just aren't as good as any other album before this. When they're good, they're just as good as on Reroute, but they often go into the territory of cringeworthy angst or bad poetry. Something like \"Borders and Shading\" is pretty damn good, if you ask me. \"Evil in a Closet\" has lyrics that I really could've done without. Seriously, it's one of the worst love songs I've ever heard. The only redeemable part of that song is the second verse.\n\nI actually quite like the front half of the album. While In Flames has always been good at making catchy tracks, Reroute to Remain struggled when it came to staying power. The band got five songs overall that still persist with the fanbase, and even more that stay with me even after listening to the album and shelving it for some time. The entire front half sticks with me (I guess \"The Quiet Place\" doesn't, but I can understand why it stays with most newer fans). However, this brings me to the back half of the album. \"Borders and Shading\" is one of the best songs on the album, yeah, it's the only stellar one in the back half. Sure, \"Evil in a Closet\" is surprisingly fantastic instrumentally, but man do the lyrics just sink the song. \"In Search of I\" has a rather catchy chorus with trademark Jesper leads (That are too far back in the mix) that I quite like, but that's the only memorable or good thing about the song. \"Superhero of the Computer Rage\" has a kickass riff, but it's complete and utter filler otherwise. That being said, \"Bottled\" is easily the biggest filler, and is the worst closer In Flames has had, only second to \"Black and White\" from Reroute to Remain.\n\n\"Discover Me Like Emptiness\" is the thirteenth track and a bonus track. This song should've been the true closing track to the album, as \"Bottled\" just does such a shitty job of it. The reason I say this is because while the song is much lighter, but not softer, it doesn't let you down. It doesn't give you the feeling of \"that's it?\". The track is actually really good and has a synth in it that isn't overbearing like Reroute To Remain. It's a fantastic song that can definitely be reveled as a classic, and it's a damn shame that it wasn't the closing track. Literally everybody would've been happier if this was the closer instead of \"Bottled\", which while I find it to be decent, it's just the biggest filler in the album. You just don't use filler as an opening track or as a closing track, that's the first rule of an album. Shove filler anywhere but there. I usually wouldn't let this affect my rating at all, but \"Bottled\" has a half second or so of a transition to \"Discover Me Like Emptiness\", meaning that it was cut for the sake of having a bonus track. That's a horrible way of handling things, and it would've been better had you not had a bonus track upon release at all. Or, you know, just use one of the other three you got at some point. Come Clarity is an album that I wish had bonus tracks (And is the only In Flames album to not have any), but I'd rather that than to have a song be cut needlessly.\n\nPart of me wants to go on about \"F(r)iend\" or \"Touch of Red\", as I love those songs and have a lot to say about them, but I think it's more worth discussing \"Dead Alone\", mainly because I'd be the first person in the world to argue for it. It's a seriously cool structure-bending song whose vocals keep it surprisingly interesting. The guitarwork works well here too, but it's mainly the drumming, synths, and vocals that make it awesome. Unfortunately, with how much lambasting I've been doing, there's a bit of a difficulty to describe what really makes this song good without sounding contradictory.\n\nBut I guess that's just it. There's a seriously contradictory feeling because for as awful as the production and mixing is, for as shoddy as the guitarwork is, and for as mediocre as the vocals are for me, someone who always argues for Anders' vocals when nobody else will, they all strangely come together to work decently well. Make no mistake, it's a pretty bad album objectively speaking. If you were to look at each element individually, yeah, I'd wonder what the fuck was going through everyone's heads, and yet it actually comes together surprisingly cohesively. In fact, I'd argue it's one of the more cohesive, smooth albums in terms of how everything ended up feeling. Maybe it's due to the synths kinda saving quite a few songs' melodies, or maybe it's because the band actually stepped up to write some pretty good songs, but it ends up working and staying with me a bit more than Reroute to Remain. In fact, this album sounds fantastic particularly when I shut my brain off and let the melodies take me, and in a way, that's exactly what the title of the album wants this to be. But at the same time, that doesn't make for objectively good music, especially since I've discovered years down the line that shoegaze and dream pop will do that rather well too. It's not the same, sure, but getting into other music that, while they do so through different means and melodies, ultimately has the same effects as this album for me. At the same time, I've gotten back into nu metal somewhat since (I never said it was objectively good overall) and come to really understand what makes it special to so many people and to myself. And frankly speaking, now that I've come back to this album with a keener ear and more musical experience, it just falls apart for me. I was obsessed with this album back in the late part of my sophomore year, and I still remember listening to this album nonstop when I went on vacation to Mount Dora in Florida back then. This album is incredible when you let yourself get lost in (Or escape to) the melodies, yes. However, while that's well and good, I want fully fleshed-out music that can stand on its own when I focus all my attention into listening to it or analyzing it. In that regard, Soundtrack To Your Escape is probably one of the weakest albums I've ever listened to, even with quite a few of the songs actually being good.\n\nThere's a review here that spoke about how the guitarwork was shot because Jesper was ridden with alcoholism and had nothing left to tell, particularly with regards to how the melodeath days were pretty much dead and gone, a nice little bit of nostalgia to look back on at most. I feel that this is only half true, as while it was certainly the case at the time, I'd argue that he came back with a vengeance on Come Clarity. He's since made decimating guitar lines with Dimension Zero, crafted wonderful melodies for Cyhra, at least on the first album, and kicked some ass with The Halo Effect, which also has Peter and Daniel. He's since come to have a lot in the tank, but I don't think he did at this time. \"Touch of Red\" and \"Bottled\", which while they may have been written about the general feeling of someone who's an alcoholic or about Anders or Bjorn, particularly speak to Jesper during that time. However, while everybody always gives credit to Jesper and while he's been my favorite guitarist since I first listened to In Flames, Bjorn is also capable of significantly better than what we got here, and I have to wonder what happened with him too. Either way, when the guitarwork is good, it's damn good. It just tends to be lacking more often that not here.\n\nIs 60% a reasonable rating given not only all of my criticisms, but how much criticizing I've done versus how much praising I've done? Honestly? I don't know. This entire album leaves me really conflicted, and depending not only on my mood. but also how I listen to it, I sometimes love this album, but I sometimes find very little to love about it. In a way, I think both feelings can be and are right. It's a rather frustrating album to go back to, and I wish I could go back to not just how much I loved this album back in high school, but the ignorance I had about music overall back then. I think the reason why this album is lambasted on this site the way it is, even if there's a ton of hyperbole there, is because this album seriously falls apart upon introspection and analysis. And it's a damn shame that they made so many compromises for the sound and atmosphere, as most of the songs here are awesome. Then again, I'm not sure that these songs would even be these songs if they were originally done with the approach that they were or with the guitarwork that ended up on the final product. It's difficult to say. While doing this review has been rather enlightening for me, I've also never been more confused by or about this album, and at this point, I have no idea what my feelings on it really are. I'm not really sure if that's something I'll get to figure out. Oh well.\n\nSongs To Recommend: \"F(r)iend\", \"Dead Alone\", \"Touch of Red\", \"Borders and Shading\", \"Discover Me Like Emptiness\"\nSongs To Avoid: \"Evil in a Closet\", \"Superhero of the Computer Rage\", \"Bottled\"\n",
        "\nIt's always been an intimidating task to even think of reviewing my favorite albums. Fiction by Dark Tranquillity, Clayman also by In Flames, Nebularium by Disarmonia Mundi, Desideratum and Constellation by Anaal Nathrakh, Above the Weeping World by Insomnium, Letters To Myself by Cyhra, and especially Come Clarity. This album has a special place in my heart, as it's what not only really got me into the band, it got me into heavier music and simply so much more music in general (Before my shoegaze renaissance, anyways). Before listening to In Flames, my favorite band was Disturbed (Shit taste, I'm aware), I grew up on nu metal, and I had only gotten into bands like Mastodon and Periphery the year before, which even then, Blood Mountain was the heaviest I went, and man, that album was always really fucking difficult to get through (Though I absolutely loved it). Now, I find Anaal Nathrakh and Endon to be some of my favorite listens, and melodeath ends up soothing enough to me that I fall sleep at night whenever I just can't pass out otherwise. I was never really a metalcore fan before listening to Come Clarity, so it's still really weird that it just clicked with me perfectly. However, in the summer after my freshman year of high school, I ended up falling in love with this album. It was heavy and abrasive, particularly with the screams, yet rather accessible. I think it was the rather wonderful melodies of \"Reflect the Storm\" that sold me on them. I still have incredible memories of listening to the song while playing Pac-Man World 2, specifically in Pac-Dot Pond. While it's rather commonly known that the memories we have associated with music significantly helps us grow a sort of attachment and love towards it, I think it's equally important for me to think about just how much it ended up helping me expand my horizons musically. I don't think I ever would've gotten into anything heavy past basic progressive metal and maybe some mid-era metalcore here and there, nor would I have ever gotten into shoegaze. And with that, I would've never started looking further into how music is made, I would've never really trained myself to hear each individual element in a given track, nor would I truly understand the sound or importance of each element. It's an album that very much shaped my future of music, and so it's difficult to look at this without the lens of nostalgia. I suppose it'd probably be an 85-90% to me objectively, but I'm willing to cede to my subjectivity somewhat here.\n\nAnders' screams weren't the best on Reroute to Remain, though it feels like he's not only finally able to reach a higher pitch than before, but he's able to project his voice much better. His clean vocals also work rather well here, even they're what most would call absolutely atrocious. While I can admit that Anders' clean vocals pale in comparison to someone like Bjorn Strid, Christian Alvestam, or Dave Hunt, they work fantastically with the music that they accompany. There's a review here that called his vocals rather awkward on every track but \"Dead End\", and I think I'd disagree. Make no mistake, I think that perceived awkwardness very much comes from the feeling that he puts a bit too much stress on his vocal cords (And seeing the deterioration of his vocals over the years due to poor technique, I can feel assured in this logic). I'd say that they fit the music and harsh vocals well, and aren't quite objectively horrible to me. Even still, I love Anders as a vocalist. Then again, I used to love Disturbed.\n\nPaired with Anders' higher screams, the guitarwork makes for straight up early metalcore. There's still the same old In Flames charm, with a bit of their melodeath sound bleeding through, and that goes a long way for the album. Unlike Reroute to Remain, there's more than just chugging for the rhythm sections, and the solos actually last a reasonable duration. Unlike STYE, there's still some technicality here, and the guitar tones aren't as rough and muddy as shit. The return of harmonized lead guitars elevates the songs to further heights than what they would've done for the previous two albums, even if those two were begging for any sort of assistance they could get there. For me, this is the strongest guitarwork of any album since Clayman, though I have to say that it ties with Sounds of a Playground Fading for me. I'm aware that nobody else agrees, but I don't give a damn.\n\nDaniel's drumming is at its best here, though the drum sound is an unfortunate step down from Reroute. I recently noticed just how phenomenal the drums in Reroute, and I think they would've helped here. The kit doesn't quite lack in power, it just isn't as punchy as in Reroute. Some songs, such as \"Dead End\" and \"Your Bedtime Story is Scaring Everyone\" are exceptions though. The bass sounds just as good, though it's unfortunately just a bit lower in the mix, which is a shame.\n\nHowever, that does bring me to the production, which is a serious double-edged sword here. It suffers the same problem as middle-era Anaal Nathrakh albums in that the guitars and vocals are a bit too forward and bring a slight bit of compression with them. It isn't really noticeable to the untrained ear, but I've come to hear it on my most recent listen. That being said, there's a part of me that really likes the production and mixing here, as Come Clarity as an album is like jamming twelve adrenaline shots into your arm and then just letting it settle as the album draws to a close. In a way, the production complements that feeling. Would I have liked to hear the bass a bit more? Yeah. Would I have liked the drums to pack a bit more of a punch in certain songs? Yeah. Either way, I think it works rather well, though I do wonder what it'd be like it the album had the same sort of production and mixing as Reroute to Remain.\n\nThere isn't a bad song in the bunch here, though if I had to point out any as being weaker than the others, I guess I'd have to say \"Scream\", \"Versus Terminus\", and \"Your Bedtime Story is Scaring Everyone\". \"Scream\" is an awesome song, but coming off the heels of the first four songs, yeah, it's kinda missing something. What's frustrating to me is that the song was *made* for live performances, and it would work phenomenally for that purpose... And yet they only played it twice that I could find. It's a song that, perhaps in another timeline, should be a staple in their setlists. \"Versus Terminus\" is a song that I quite like, and when I'm in the mood for it, it's one of my favorites, but it really isn't as aggressive as the rest of the songs nor a ballad like the title track. It's still great, but I can understand why some may feel it's lesser. The closing track also takes a while to kick in, with the subdued electronic melody sounding surprisingly pleasant. I could see this part being an intro for them live, but I doubt that ever happened. That being said, once you get to the last two or so minutes of the song, it's rather aggressive and intense, though not in the way of the rest of the album in terms of energy or speed. It's a song that sounds legitimately angry, and when dissecting the lyrics, it's easy to see that it's for quite legitimate reasons.\n\nThis leads to the lyrics, which are fantastic (Though I will say, every album from their glory days has incredible lyrics). I'd say half of the album falls into the territory of an anger towards society, though not in the vein of something like Slipknot, but instead more in the vein of Anaal Nathrakh (At least with some songs we actually know some of the lyrics to). It's not quite lashing out, it's more of bringing up problems with the media and the system (Most notable in \"Leeches\", \"Vacuum\", and the closing track). It's not something I can explain that well, and I'd instead urge you to read about the lyrics of those songs on Genius. The other half of the songs are more geared towards personal struggles, but not in the vein of Reroute and STYE's analytical and somewhat disconnected approaches. Come Clarity gets into this in a way that appears rather emo on the surface, but it thankfully isn't. \"Take This Life\" seems rather straightforward until you realize that it's actually about taking care of and taking charge of one's life, and instilling confidence in oneself. It quite literally screams that although life is difficult and that the pressures and stresses of it can push one to the ledge, life is ultimately a gift that should be cherished. The title track, meanwhile, may seem like it's about someone who's numb and depressed, it's actually dedicated to Anders' then two year-old daughter.\n\n\"By two drawing pictures of innocent times\nCan you add color inside these lines?\"\n\nThis is one of the most telling and beautiful lines of the song for me, as it's not only phrased in a sort of childlike way, it's in a way looking back to the past when Anders was a child, and in another way looking at *these* innocent times- The present that he has with his daughter as she's growing up. The two are figuratively and literally drawing said pictures together, and him adding her to add color in the lines represents her giving him a purpose, a joy, and a fulfillment in life. There aren't really that many songs that have such beautiful lyrics to me.\n\nAnd that ties into Come Clarity's overall theme. Every In Flames album (Up until Siren Charms was Siren Charms) has a theme or narrative to it. For Come Clarity, it's introspection. From \"Take This Life\" being about one's own life, to the title track being about one's child's life and their own as a parent, to \"Leeches\" being about paving one's own way in a world where ignorance is the norm, to the closing track addressing how the media isn't really telling the news in an objective manner anymore, instead using fear-mongering in a way where everything sounds like a crisis or a be-all-end-all situation. While Reroute and STYE sort of clumsily navigated their themes, Come Clarity goes through its own rather masterfully. Sure, a line here or there may seem out of place, even after coming to understand the rest of the song, but I think that goes for every album there is.\n\nCome Clarity is an album that expertly mixes beauty and introspection with aggression and energy in a way that not only make it so that neither side is compromised, but in a way that further helps to make each song feel multifaceted. Come Clarity is a fast-paced adrenaline rush, and I felt that the most on my first listen in a way that Mindtricks by Disarmonia Mundi and Desideratum by Anaal Nathrakh did. However, it still retains that magic of the first listen in a different way than most albums tend to: The lyrics, which should feel disjointed and contradictory to the music and to the other songs, really don't. They shine in a wonderful way, especially when you make every connection. \"Crawl Through Knives\", a fan favorite song that's pretty much iconic for fans of the newer music, is probably the simplest song on here. Even then, it's still one about sheer dedication and loyalty. It may be aggressive and intense, particularly with the insane high note towards the end, but that's precisely the point with the lyrics. \"Reflect the Storm\" is the most abstract lyrically, or at least the most metaphorical, and I haven't quite figured out what each line means just yet.\n\nI can't exactly recommend any one song, nor can I list any to avoid. They're all fantastic. Sure, the three I mentioned above may be a bit weaker than the rest to some, but they're merely B-tier at worst if you ask me. If I have to pick one whose quality is simply immaculate, it's \"Dead End\". I often go back and forth on which song is my favorite, but I think \"Dead End\" is objectively the best. Lisa Miskovsky's vocals are simply perfect, and I think she's the best female guest the band's brought in out of all four songs with them. She and Anders have such contrasting dynamics in the verses, with her being serene and controlled in an almost threatening way with the context of the lyrics, while his vocals are aggressive and in a way, accusing. Yet somehow, they come together beautifully in the chorus. The instrumentals go back and forth between a feeling of impending disaster and complete and utter intensity. The performances of everyone here complements the lyrics perfectly.\n\nI could go on and on with more and more praises for this album, but I know that I do have to reign it in at some point. While, yes, it's a wonderful experience listening to each song individually, I think it's just as important to occasionally listen to the album from front to back to get the whole atmosphere and fulfillment of it. There's something truly special about this album, especially with how it feels different every time I listen to it. It's never a dull feeling, and the lyrics truly help to flesh it out in what I feel is a monumental way. As much as I want to give it a 100%, I want to reserve that for albums that have no real problems, no dull moments, and no elements that disappoint me in any sort of way. Come Clarity barely misses the mark for me, unfortunately, but goddamn does it come really close to reaching it. I didn't give much attention to the criticisms, as it's tough for me to come up with valid criticisms for it, but the three songs listed, and the production and mixing of the drums and bass are just enough to keep this out of the prime cuts of my ratings. Then again, the fact that it came so close to reaching it is a feat all on its own, as I gatekeep the ever-loving shit of the 100% rating.\n\nI wish metalcore ended up following in the direction of Come Clarity, instead of being much more inspired by a djent sound. While I can enjoy djent overall, modern metalcore lacks technicality and good melodies, it follows a formulaic harsh verse/clean chorus structure that seldom deviates, and it more often than not either has a breakdown that varies in quality or some shitty solo. A Sense of Purpose tends to have more acclaim by some for its increased focus on melodies, rather than heaviness, though others (Particularly older fans) actually see Come Clarity as a shining star in the newer discography. While I've noticed that In Flames albums tends to have batches of two that are rather similar (With the exception of Reroute and STYE) in style and approach, A Sense of Purpose just feels like Come Clarity Part 2 to me, and I don't really mean that as a compliment. It scraped up the surface of Come Clarity, added some melodies, and called it a day, unfortunately. I'm sure I'll review it at some point once I can actually muster up the desire to listen to it for a second time, but I'm more inclined to give a full listen to Battles again. With that, I think I'm going to reminisce about the easier times of high school as I play some more Pac-Man. Cheers.\n\nNot doing a recommend/avoid list, since there's nothing I'd put on either list.\n",
        "\nOne of the most appreciated cds from In Flames - \"The Jester Race\". Where do these opinions come from? Well, from the fact that 2 years after their debut, Jesper Str\u00f6mblad's band did not depart too radically from the sounds known from \"Lunar Strain\", i.e. they started improving the production, catchiness, reducing folk inserts and increasing melodious side, and at the same time managed to achieve much better promotion. So, from the perspective of the previous album, the changes are logical and in a sense quite necessary! Another important thing, the Swedes on \"The Jester Race\" have made a fairly stable line-up. In Flames was joined by: guitarist/drummer Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte and - taken from Dark Tranquility - vocalist Anders Frid\u00e9n (who was replaced in Dark Tranquility by...Michael Stanne - previously singer on \"Lunar...\"), that is as time has shown, two of the most important members in the direction taken by the group after 2000. \n\nReturning to \"The Jester Race\" itself, this disc, as I mentioned, offers a progress of the threads from its predecessor - hence it's not surprising, although it maintains that level. So the dynamics, the \"flesh\" in the guitars and the sound of the drums were improved; on the other side, heavy metal melodies, melancholic atmosphere and general \"delicacy\". It's not that much (although for some it's quite the opposite), but I can assure you that despite the greater amount of melody, there is no excessive kitsch or boredom in this playing - even for them. A word more about the exchange of vocalist. Here I have no major reservations, Anders Frid\u00e8n neatly fitted the style of the band (even with a few \"spoken\" parts) and reliably replaced Michael Stanne - so it's a 1:1 exchange. \n\nIt was said that \"The Jester Race\" develops the ideas of \"Lunar...\" and does it to a similarly interesting extent as its predecessor. The confirmation here can be heard in the cool \"Lord Hypnos\", \"Graveland\", \"Artifacts Of The Black Rain\", the \"prettier\" \"December Flower\" or the more specific \"Dead Eternity\" (at the beginning there are even blast beats!), but honestly, due to the quite even coherent level of the whole, a significant part of these songs - which in the context of their later albums appears to be a huge advantage. However, to make it not too sweet, the Swedes once again stuffed two boring instrumentals here (\"Wayfaerer\" qualifies for crap at all), sometimes they focused too much on their melodic side and they too often exaggerates with the acoustic guitars. Without these disadvantages, \"The Jester Race\" would certainly be more compact and would have far less extreme opinions. After all, there are - contrary to appearances - many reasons to like it.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/10/in-flames-jester-race-1996.html\n",
        "\nThe end from my side - In Flames! Well, before \"real listeners\" regrets in the comments section, it should be remembered that this band had a surprisingly large part in the development of melo-death, and what's more, that their early activities (until 2000) were even fine! - as a guilty pleasure of course. Along with At The Gates and Dark Tranquility, Jesper Str\u00f6mblad's band was one of the first (though the last of these two) that bring a lot of melodies to the death metal atmosphere and which - unlike their colleagues - began to...shift these proportions towards the melody itself. At the very beginning, there was no drama about it, the balance between gentleness and heaviness was quite suitable and it did not fall into any absurdities - although I also realize that not everyone will like such a formula. The first example of this turned out to be their debut \"Lunar Strain\", which, compared to the debuts of Dark Tranquility or At The Gates, was...clearly weaker. \n\nAnd here comes a paradox, because of being the worst...the discussed \"Lunar Strain\" appears as one of the most interesting (and best) cds in the - too extensive - discography of In Flames! Okay, the dose of melodies already on the debut turned out to be very large (and as I mentioned, this is just a foretaste of what will happen next), but it did not cover as much of the heaviness as it bursts out of this music. On the contrary, the more you listen to this album, the more you hear sense in the melodies, some folk inserts (such as the violin) or dosing on brutality - of course, excluding the Stockholm syndrome here. \n\nSimply, this very specific approach to the melody comes into a nice, melo(sic!)-death music, which includes a lot of interesting guitar parts (clearly inspired by heavy metal - which should not be surprising), a rather non-obvious drums style (but without blasts), meaningful, furious vocals from - the future frontman of Dark Tranquility - Mikael Stanne and a captivating, Scandinavian atmosphere. The \"Starforsaken\", \"Behind Space\", \"In Flames\" or the title track are proof of all this, but in order not to mention everything - most of this album. This \"minority\" where you can reservations to \"Lunar Strain\" concerns only in the middle of the album - a bit too fancy (especially in \"Everlost I/II\", where ambitions take precedence over skill) and unnecessarily separated by two boring instrumentals. Besides, as I mentioned, the In Flames debut is surprisingly good to listen to. And this despite the fact that this band has to be approached with trepidation.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/10/in-flames-lunar-strain-1994.html\n",
        "\n(These first two paragraphs are part of one huge rant. If you're not interested in that, everything that really matters is below those two.)\n\nI've been meaning to review this album for a *very* long time now. It's undoubtedly in the bottom two when it comes to In Flames albums both objectively and subjectively (Though I think it's growing on me a lot more than A Sense of Purpose is at the moment), and that will hopefully never change. I was originally going to lay into this album without any intention to defend it because I hated it just a little bit less than Battles. Fortunately or unfortunately, that's very much changed, and I think this may be my longest review yet. Finally, after I, the Mask, we've come to see In Flames climbing out of that ditch they dug just a little bit. While so many believe that Sounds of a Playground Fading is the first album of In Flames' dark ages (It really feels like most old IF fans parted ways with them after ASoP), I think that Siren Charms is where those seeds with the songwriting first sprouted. Make no mistake, they were there back in A Sense of Purpose, and even moreso in Sounds of a Playground Fading, but for the most part, I think the change in the songwriting (Particularly in terms of the melodies) actually works there. Here, particularly with the solos... Not so much. I latched on to a couple songs from this album on first listen, but it was easily bottom two even before I both got into melodeath, black metal, Anaal Nathrakh (They just have their own feel), shoegaze, etc. and before I really began to understand what separates good music from bad music. The band recorded Siren Charms in six weeks (I'm not particularly sure how much time they spent writing, but I'm not sure it was that much, as I remember hearing something about it being under a year, though I couldn't find anything to confirm that), and I respect the fuck out of them for that because it shows. Siren Charms tried to do something unique, even with them following up on SoaPF's sound, which I appreciate so much more than Battles' cookie cutter, disingenuous, autotuned to Hell and back, pop metal bullshit. The problem is that Siren Charms is *really* incohesive, the songs vary in quality, the pacing is a mess, many segments with mediocre to poor writing. Pair those issues with Anders' waning vocals that made the autotune on Battles a sadly needed crutch, Anders broke away from more personal lyrics (For the most part) and replaced them with some pretty cringeworthy shit, Bjorn added some really annoying high-pitched solos has laced the modern era's music with (That did work when they appeared on previous albums, for the most part) that are also incohesive with the rest of the music, severe missteps with production/mixing included but not limited to: Compressed drums that lack punch, certain solos being multiple decibels louder than they should be, the bass just not being present all too often (Which tended to not be an issue for In Flames up until Siren Charms, and would unfortunately become a continued issue from here on out), etc. I don't think production and mixing cut into their six week time limit, so it's baffling why it's so goddamn rife with issues. For all I know, there was also time crunch there too, but I haven't found any information regarding that. \n\nEither way, one thing is for sure: Sony Music, their label for *only* Siren Charms, should never have put such a time constraint on them. Such a time constraint should never be placed on a band in general, and I absolutely blame Sony Music the most for the issues here. I'm not only blaming them, as the band should've had some form of quality control, but I completely understood why they didn't, or rather really couldn't. Sure, the writing process wasn't confined to that timeframe, but it was done while touring, so I get why they didn't have the attentiveness for quality control then. That's something that is generally saved for writing while off the road or for when the band is in the studio, which they didn't exactly have. Considering that they were touring as late as August 2013 (Just over a year before the release of Siren Charms), I personally believe that they didn't have suitable time to do that much quality control for the writing. I'd imagine that production and mixing had to have a process that lasted at least two-three months each.\n\nThat being said, there are so many more issues than just the songwriting, even if it's the biggest issue. Anders' vocals are at their lowest point here, and the production and mixing is at their lowest point until Howard Benson eviscerated whatever little could be salvaged from Battles. The lyrics are, for the most part, really bad, and a massive step down from Sounds of a Playground Fading, which was one of the band's best outings lyrically.\n\nAlright, now that I've both tore the album apart and defended it maybe a little too much, let's get into each individual piece.\n\nThe guitars here aren't too bad, actually. They come out really clear, with production not butchering them nor mixing pushing them too far back. Clean guitars are gain some prevalence on Siren Charms (\"With Eyes Wide Open\", \"Siren Charms\"), and they sound really nice here. As much as I would've liked \"Paralyzed\" or \"Through Oblivion\" to gain such treatment as well, I get why they didn't and think they're fine without it. Leads are mostly good, though some songs like \"Dead Eyes\" and \"Filtered Truth\" are dead on arrival. The rhythm section's actually pretty good (Then again, I grew up on nu metal, so I might just have shit taste), and I think that's due to Engelin's contributions, which tend to go without much fanfare. I think that'll change with The Halo Effect, but maybe people'll stay too caught up with Jesper (Which, in fairness, it's fucking Jesper, he's incredible). I hear Engelin's sound quite a bit on \"Everything's Gone\", which I liked well enough on first listen, but it's especially grown on me recently. The solos, however... Most of them are really high pitched and annoying as fuck, and while they're *objectively* fine... I think most of us really don't like Bjorn's style there. Considering that solos tend to be a high point for In Flames, it's really sad to see. I'll counter the argument of: \"Well, what about December Flower's solo? It's also high pitched!\" Yes, but it is in a way that sounds good, and the leads complement it perfectly. Siren Charms really doesn't have either luxury, as I think I'd rather hear a violin being played incorrectly while it's being sawed in half vertically. All exaggeration aside, if Disarmonia Mundi does it right and you do it wrong, you have a serious issue.\n\nI pretty much said all I needed to about the drums. Compressed and lacking in punch. \"Everything's Gone\" is an exception, weirdly enough, and it works for ballads and lighter songs like \"Paralyzed\", \"Through Oblivion\", and \"With Eyes Wide Open\". Otherwise, save for the bonus tracks (Which are both phenomenal in every aspect), they're the weakest they've ever been for In Flames, and it's a really sad sendoff for Svensson.\n\nAgain, the bass is a bit lost in the mix. Fuck. Keyboards are fine, nothing too much to say there.\n\nVocals... See, they work for a couple songs like the stretch of songs from \"Everything's Gone\" through the title track, but there are many times where he sounds like he's straining, or like his vocals are damaged/worn down. This is something that would get better with time, and Anders actually sounds so much better in live performances for some of these songs years down the line. His screams and growls in particularly have suffered severely, to the point where even I, someone who quite likes and pretty much always defends Anders' vocals, can't say that they're good. He sounds faint and frail with them, and can rarely sustain a scream or growl. As for his clean vocals, they're quite nice in certain songs. In others, you have pretty much spoken word with him attempting to have the cadence of his clean singing, and it doesn't quite work.\n\nIt's unfortunate because this album's finally grown on me, for some reason. I know it's not good, and it's not exactly a guilty pleasure like Battles simply because the melodies are catchy. I think that there's genuinely good musicianship buried somewhere here, but with each and every issue, it's like another layer of sediment on top of a chest of gold. The hard rock/heavier alt metal style genuinely works for the band like with Sounds of a Playground Fading, though not quite as well here due to songwriting issues and what feels sounds decades of age since the prior release. \"Everything's Gone\" is an awesome song, and even though the studio version doesn't quite have the power that it has the potential to carry, live performances absolutely do, though anything not on the base album doesn't affect my rating or review. \"Paralyzed\" and \"Through Oblivion\" work as genuinely good lighter, catchy hard rock songs in a vain that ballads like \"The Chosen Pessimist\", \"Here Until Forever\", \"Evil in a Closet\", etc. from the other albums don't quite reach. \"With Eyes Wide Open\" and \"Siren Charms\" are phenomenal ballads instrumentally, even if the lyrics kill whatever goodwill the songs could have. \"Rusted Nail\" has a lot of variety with its delivery, particularly vocally, with each verse, chorus, and section feeling distinct because of little touches that actually show how much care should've and would've gone into the album if it had the proper time to do so. The band clearly knew that this would be the lead single, so they put that much care into it. \"When the World Explodes\" works because of Emilia Feldt, though she's probably my least favorite female vocalist they've had feature. By now, I might very well be right on the cusp of the threshold for a \"track by track\" review, and that's because there's a lot to talk about with each song... And yet they're all so forgettable. I don't listen to \"With Eyes Wide Open\" ever. I only listen to the instrumental version of the title track. \"When the World Explodes\", as the resident heavy song, just isn't heavy enough for me anymore, and just how thin it is became evident. The opener is pretty formulaic and mediocre, save for the electronic intro. Not to mention, the band fumbles the ball at the last moment with \"Dead Eyes\" and the closer. They're easily \"Bottled\" levels of filler, and that's fucking aggravating to me, especially since the bonus tracks can easily stand up with the best of In Flames' catalogue. The bonus tracks are actually a bit experimental in structure and approach, they sound phenomenal in every way, and they could so easily replace these two dead-tier tracks to make the album be remembered well by ending off on a good note. Even then, I completely understand why the four lighter songs/ballads would turn people away. Even though they're written well and don't have those annoying fucking solos, they're so far removed from why people love in Flames. The former two take a middle ground that are just alienating enough, and the latter two have such poor lyrics that they actively kill the songs.\n\nI think there's genuinely something to love here, but every fucking issue all stack up to make a really poor album. When you dig beneath the surface and try to dissect the album, there's a ton of variety, *some* good musicianship, clear passion, and some good ideas. In fact, if you were to take the best of the best from this album and its bonus tracks, do some damage control, and turn them into an EP, you would probably have one of In Flames' best releases. Maybe it's just because the album's grown on me as time's gone on, maybe it's because I'm mellowing out as I'm getting a bit older (Not to say that I'm old yet), or maybe it's because I've been learning so much more about music, writing music, reading tabs, and music theory. I don't really know. All I know is that if given the proper time- And \"Rusted Nail\" proves this for me- In Flames could've made a really solid follow-up to Sounds of a Playground Fading, which is still my second-favorite album from the band.\n\nThis is where I'd love to end the review on a positive note. Unfortunately, the band put out an F tier album after this. Battles is just horrendous, and anything positive I said about this album just doesn't apply there. It's easily the simplest, poppiest, most disingenuous, and outright bad In Flames album to date. Down, Wicked, and No Good did what Battles attempted to far better than it when it comes to the synth pop side, and I, the Mask did what Battles attempted to do far better than it on the metal side. And even with all the shit I have talked and will continue to talk about Battles, I genuinely think that In Flames and Benson *could've* done the style well for that album. I think Fandigo by Callejon (A band who I otherwise don't particularly care for) is a fantastic album in the same style as Battles. It goes for synth rock in a much better way, has some metalcore moments in some songs, tackles song structure differently, is much more genuine with its introspection, and is just better music than Battles overall. If you're a newer In Flames fans who hated Battles like myself, do give Fandigo a try. If you don't like it, that's perfectly understandable, especially since it isn't In Flames. But then again, neither is Battles. Nothing about Battles screams In Flames. As someone whose favorite band is In Flames, I can't even say that about Siren Charms.\n\nHere's probably the trickiest section of all. See, I don't really know what to recommend on either side here. So with everything I know about both older and newer In Flames fans, this is all I feel confident enough to put.\n\nTracks to Recommend: \"Everything's Gone\", \"The Chase\", \"Become the Sky\"\nTracks to Avoid: \"With Eyes Wide Open\", \"Dead Eyes\", \"Filtered Truth\"\n",
        "\nThis extended play's title track is the song that made me appreciate In Flames back when I was eighteen years old. I have since attended two concerts of the band and purchased all its studio albums.\n\nIn my humble opinion, ''The Mirror's Truth'' represents everything that I like about contemporary in Flames tracks. The production is energetic, loud and vibrant just like a melodic death metal record should sound like. The songwriting is creative and concise as the song might only be three minutes long but offers numerous outstanding ideas. This track is perfectly balanced between the band's rougher side in form of ecstatic vocals in the verses, fast rhythm section and energetic guitar riffs and the group's more harmonious side with melodic vocals in the chorus, catchy guitar melodies you won't be able to get out of your mind upon first hearing them and heartfelt guitar solos going back to traditional heavy metal stylistics. Until today, this song remains one of my very favourite tracks in the band's impressive repertoire and is still an excellent choice to introduce potential new fans to the band. On a side note, I even know people who hate growls and screams in metal who find this song particularly addictive and memorable. This song might even introduce younger metal fans to extreme metal music.\n\nThe other three songs can't quite keep this high-quality level to be honest. They are b-sides and didn't make it onto A Sense of Purpose for a reason. That doesn't mean that those songs are dreadful. They are just a little bit exchangeable. The songwriting once again combines aggressive, fast and raw passages with melodic and memorable sections. The riffs and vocal lines in particular sound a little bit rehashed. These songs are missing truly catchy choruses or inspired ideas as they are great to listen to but rush by without leaving any marks.\n\nAt the end of the day, occasional fans should simply purchase the excellent studio record A Sense of Purpose. Collectors should only buy this output here if they like the style of said record. This extended play was a great teaser before the studio album was released but isn't too relevant in hindsight. My suggestion would be to grab this extended play at a reduced price or to purchase the remastered version of A Sense of Purpose that includes this extended play's exclusive tunes as bonus tracks.\n",
        "\nAfter a brief cover-art inspired dalliance with new Dark Tranquillity, the next step was \"Do In Flames still exist?\", this may seem obvious if you're a European but IF had a brief bit in the spotlight 15-ish years ago here in Australia before immediately disappearing into the aether, and I hadn't heard anything from them post-Playgrounds. Anyway, yeah it turns out that they still exist, unfortunately the artwork is a good deal worse than the new DT, and they're basically a really really really bad metalcore band.\n\n\"You don't remember, so I need to figure it out\nBut the memories fade, the truth is that I'm not so sure\nf we'll make it at all, I can't even trust myself\"\n\nI reckon a good way to describe this album is that when I used to do mining there'd always be a rando 50 year old colleague who is single, no kids, and spends his whole time on break doing lines, banging hookers, partying hard, whatever. If you're in your 20s, whatever y'know, do your thing. But there's an age where living it up 24/7 becomes hopelessly lame and/or desperate. In Flames are the 50 year old, but in this case they're still living their teen angst phase. It's a term that's hopelessly dated, but remember how the word \"emo\" got thrown around constantly in metal in the 00's? The term perfectly applies here.\n\n\"This is the fight, the fight for our lives! Scream out loud \"This is our house!\"\n\nLike holy fuck dude, you must be nudging your late 40s if not 50s. Is this really the best you can come up with? How on Earth did the other band members, the record label execs, the recording studio janitor etc etc not go \"these lyrics are bad and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD don't reprise it as a feelsy clean part\". \n\nTempting as it is, I shouldn't just dunk on Anders all review, as hatefully shit as he is, in every facet, all the time. Everything else is completely and awesomely lame, old Whoracle riffs watered down to levels homeopathic, mixed with a bunch of kinda heavy rock-ish stuff, chord progressions but with a lot of distortion, sorta thing. There are the occasional half arsed fast bits, but they are rare and uninteresting enough to mean absolutely nothing. If that sounds boring, that's because it is. It perhaps wouldn't be completely awful if there was a really charismatic vocalist over the top but uh, well. And yknow that's probably the main problem with these guys, with the riffs so played out and predictable there's nothing here that gets the blood flowing. The rhythm section is completely faceless, the production clean, efficient and in no way interesting, the vocals a fucken war crime of a job.\n\nAnyway, I know I've said it elsewhere and I'll say it again; living in a country that isn't particularly into metal has some bonuses sometimes. Not ever having to hearing stuff like this is a good, good thing. I think this is my last dalliance in wondering what old melodeath bands are up to, needless to say. I kinda liked the Deep Inside opening riff so let's give this album a generous 2%.\n\nLet's just close it off with some more poetry from our man:\n\n\"All the pain I feel\nAll the pain I feel, blood and tears\nYou're the monster that brought me here\nAll the pain I feel\"\n",
        "\nRegardless of what one thinks of Reroute to Remain or Soundtrack to Your Escape, I think that the vast majority of In Flames fans would agree that the quality of the band's works after Clayman was in decline. Despite doing well commercially, Soundtrack to Your Escape was easily the worst album the band had put out in their entire career at this point, so it was clear that they needed to step up their game on the next release. Luckily for us, that is exactly what they did. Come Clarity is often seen as a comeback album for In Flames, partially due to the fact that the previous record, Soundtrack to Your Escape, had little to do with the classic In Flames sound and a lot more to do with attempting to appeal to the angsty teen music market. Because of this, it is not surprising that fans of the band were less than enthused by the stylistic changes the band undertook on the record. As explained in my review of the album, I don\u2019t hate Soundtrack to Your Escape (I actually think it\u2019s pretty decent for what it is), but it was definitely not an album where the band played to their strengths. Luckily, the band basically ditched the sound featured on their previous record altogether here, exchanging it for a style that sounds like a hybrid between the modern edge of Reroute to Remain and the brilliant songwriting and riffwork of Clayman. \n\nOut of all the modern In Flames albums, Come Clarity is usually cited by fans as being the most faithful to the band\u2019s back catalogue and it isn\u2019t hard to see why. Come Clarity, in spite of its catchy nature, is a very riff centered album. The music on the album alternates between melodic and heavy riffs pretty frequently and, on top of that, there are lots of the signature guitar leads that the band is known for. With the exception of the title track and the album closer \u201cYour Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone\u201d, every single track on the album is loaded with this kind of writing. Aside from this, the album also has quite a bit of variety when it comes to the songs in general. Tracks like \u201cLeeches\u201d, \u201cCrawl Through Knives\u201d, and the album opener, \u201cTake This Life\u201d, feel like \u201cmodern\u201d In Flames and, this is by no means a bad thing. These tracks go for a more commercially friendly sound and end up being extremely catchy while still maintaining the excellent riff work that permeates the entire album. Another standout \"modern\" track is the song \"Dead End\", which features excellent female vocals and guitar riffing. On the other hand, there are tracks like \u201cVaccum\u201d, \u201cScream\u201d, and \u201cVersus Terminus\u201d that are aggressive and feel very similar to old In Flames due to the abundance of melodeath riffing. Aside from these, the track \u201cPacing Death\u2019s Trail\u201d is also filled to the brim with the old In Flames sound and contains an excellent chorus (accompanied by shredding guitar work) that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on an album like Colony or Clayman. The intro to the track \u201cVanishing Light\u201d also sounds like it was ripped straight from Colony. The similarities to albums like Colony and Clayman also come in the form of the choruses on Come Clarity that are fantastic in general. Some of them are fast and energetic, while others are slower and more emotional, but in general the writing on these is some of the catchiest I've ever heard on a metal record. I remember the first time I heard this album I actually immediately replayed some of the songs (which is something I never do) just because the choruses were so infectious. \n\nOutside of all the metal, the title track on Come Clarity is also pretty interesting. This track is a mostly acoustic ballad and, like \u201cDawn of a New Day'' on Reroute To Remain, the folky sounding guitars sound distinctly In Flames. While there is some of this in the rest of the album, the vocals on this song sound very angsty and pained which could be a turn off for some listeners, but personally I think that Anders does a great job here with creating an emotionally charged song and I am saying this as someone who usually dislikes ballads. The chorus on this song is also very memorable and I can\u2019t help but feel nostalgic whenever I hear it since the \u201cangsty teen\u201d feel of the music always makes me think of my high school days. Lastly, the closing track \u201cYour Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone\u201d is also different from the rest of the album. This track is an ambient interlude that just sort of drones on for a while before the band comes in at the end with heavy guitars and Anders\u2019 singing to finally close the album. In my opinion, this track is pretty pointless and probably didn\u2019t need to be on the album.\n\nAs one could probably guess from all of this, the performances on Come Clarity are excellent in general. As is the case with every In Flames album from The Jester Race onwards, the vocals on Come Clarity are handled by none other than Anders Frieden and he does an excellent job here. On the previous two records, Anders had been attempting to change his vocal style to better suit the band\u2019s new alternative sound and, while I think his performances were fine for the most part, his vocals on these albums were kind of rough because he hadn\u2019t yet mastered this style he was going for. Here on Come Clarity, he has finally pulled it off. His harsh vocals are high pitched, aggressive sounding shrieks that fit the music perfectly and his cleans sound great this time around. As for the instruments, the guitar work on Come Clarity is handled by Jesper Stromblad and Bjorn Gelotte and this is probably the best work they ever did after Clayman. I\u2019ve already gone over this, but melodic and aggressive metal riffing abounds on Come Clarity and there are also a lot of melodic guitar leads and solos. All of this absolutely shreds and it adds a lot of replayability to the album. The drums on the album are handled by Daniel Svensson and he also does a great job here. There is a lot of fast thrashy drumming throughout the album\u2019s duration and there is an abundance of tightly executed double bass work as well. Finally, at long last, the bass work handled by Peter Iwers is almost completely buried in the mix and despite having literally listened to the album repeatedly over the span of four or so years, I can\u2019t remember a single instance of it. It is safe to say that the bass is not the focus here. \n\nIn the end, Come Clarity is considered the best modern In Flames album for a reason and it is living proof that bands can modernize and/or commercialize their sound without compromising the quality of their music. Present day In Flames would do well to learn from albums like this as they seem to keep completely missing the mark on every single new album they put out. If you're a fan of this band you\u2019ve probably heard this album before, but if you haven\u2019t you're doing yourself a disservice. In my opinion Come Clarity, is almost as good as the albums from the band\u2019s classic era and I have no problem whatsoever with proclaiming this to be the best modern In Flames album.\n",
        "\nGenerally speaking, when a band loses a member that contributes heavily to their songwriting the results can be disastrous. One of the most notorious examples of this was when Chris DeGarmo left Queensryche and the band\u2019s quality took an absolute nosedive. Some bands, however, are able to stay the course, like Immortal after the departure of Abbath. It seems to me that a lot of the remaining old In Flames sound that can be found on albums like Come Clarity and A Sense of Purpose was a result of guitarist Jesper Stromblad\u2019s influence on the band\u2019s writing process. This certainly seems to be the case when one takes a look at the albums that followed this one. However, Sounds of a Playground Fading, in spite of its embarrassing title, doesn\u2019t quite follow this assumption. Oddly enough, the album is actually a pretty solid continuation of the sound that the band played on the previous album, A Sense of Purpose, with only a few minor issues that keep it from standing up to the band\u2019s previous alternative metal records. \n\nBefore I get into the music on Sounds of a Playground Fading, there is something that I think I need to address. As one can probably tell, this album was not received well by this website and that is to be expected from a site that focuses on the metal music underground. With that being said, this album was actually met with relatively decent reception as evidenced by the passable, but unexceptional user averages on a lot of the other music sites that I frequent. Generally, the album seems to have mixed reception, like with most of the band\u2019s albums after Clayman. \n\nAs I mentioned before, the music on Sounds of a Playground Fading is somewhat similar to that of the previous record, but with more of a rock style. I would say that the riffs on the album are still mostly metallic, but the slow drumming, extremely polished production, and catchy choruses make this the most commercially friendly In Flames album that was released until this point. The opening track, which is also the title track, is an excellent example of this, as it features lots of catchy riffs and beat-based drumming. The chorus is also pretty melodic, featuring some surprisingly good singing from Anders Frieden and a melodic guitar lead that calls back to the days of old. Many of the songs on Sounds of a Playground Fading play out in the same fashion, with tracks such as \u201cDeliver Us\u201d, \u201cAll For Me\u201d, and \u201cWhere The Dead Ships Dwell\u201d standing out from the bunch. All of these tracks contain excellent riffs, guitar leads, and choruses, and I\u2019d even go as far to say that the choruses on this album are one of the most memorable aspects of the music, which isn\u2019t normally the case for a metal record. While the album is usually pretty consistent with it\u2019s sound, there is one last standout track that is generally what is talked about when In Flames\u2019 fans bring up this record and that is \u201cA New Dawn\u201d. This particular track is a homage to old In Flames that the band probably included on the album to appease the old fans. I personally think this song is pretty cool, but I\u2019ve heard people go as far as to say it\u2019s the band\u2019s best song since Clayman, which is, in my opinion, utterly absurd. The song is an interesting addition nonetheless. \n\nFinally, we get to the main issue with the album and that is that some of the songs simply aren\u2019t good. First off, the track \u201cThe Attic\u201d, is a complete snoozefest. This is some sort of \u201catmospheric\u201d acoustic track that literally goes nowhere and straight up wastes 3+ minutes of the listener's life. The track \u201cThe Jester\u2019s Door\u201d is another dud that is pretty similar. Apparently the lyrics are supposed to be a tribute to Jesper Stromblad, since he had to leave the band to go into rehab, but that does not excuse them from making it some terrible interlude/experimental thing. Why not make an actual song? Lastly, the closing track \u201cLiberation\u201d is yet another misfire. On this particular track, the band ditches metal altogether and starts playing alternative rock. While this is not inherently a bad thing, this song is just extremely boring and forced sounding. \n\nMoving on to the line up, the vocals on Sounds of a Playground Fading were, as always, handled by Anders Frieden, and honestly, he does a great job here. He has the same gruff singing style that he did on the previous record and I have no idea why he ever stopped using these kinds of vocals. They sound great and fit the catchier style the band is playing here way better than his harsh vocals ever would. As for the guitars, Bjorn Gelotte handles all of the guitar parts on the album and once again I don\u2019t understand how he fails so hard on the band\u2019s material following this album. Sounds of a Playground Fading contains an abundance of catchy melodic metal riffs and guitar leads with more than a hint of the old In Flames sound. There are also some solid solos and groovy riffs as well. Generally, the guitar playing is pretty solid. The drumming on the album is, yet again, handled by Daniel Svensson and, while his performance here is definitely not as complex as the band\u2019s previous work, it gets the job done. There is some double bass at points, but that is about as technical as it gets. His work here is in a hard rock style so simple beats are the most common thing present. Lastly, Peter Iwers plays the bass on the album and, I keep saying this, but I seriously never even notice bass on any of these albums. It\u2019s sort of there if you really look for it, but it just plays along with the music. It never stands out once in the album\u2019s 54 minute runtime. \n\nIn the end, Sounds of a Playground Fading is a pretty solid and enjoyable album. Personally, this is the last In Flames album I like and I wish that the band\u2019s newer albums were at least this good. I think that we would all like for the band to suddenly return to form and crank out the The Jester Race II, but, realistically, that isn\u2019t going to happen. I\u2019d settle for this as the new norm for In Flames, but apparently the band isn\u2019t even capable of doing that. That is the main reason why I find this album to be perplexing. The band still has the same guitarist and the same vocalist that were on this album. They don\u2019t have to suck, yet they continue to do so. Anyway, I was initially hesitant to listen to Sounds of a Playground Fading, but after I finally did a few years ago, the album ended up being surprisingly enjoyable. I think that if you are a fan of this band\u2019s mid-era material, you\u2019ll have a good chance at liking this, but for people who are still hung up on the band\u2019s shift in sound or exclusively listen to extreme metal, this album will not appeal to you in the slightest. \n\nRecommended tracks: \n\"Deliver Us\"\n\"All For Me\"\n\"Where the Dead Ships Dwell\" \n\"The Puzzle\"\n",
        "\nBack when I was in high school, I absolutely loved At The Gates. Before listening to Slaughter of the Soul, I had a lot of difficulty getting into the harder subgenres of metal because I quite simply didn\u2019t understand the music. It was chaotic, abrasive, and the vocals were rougher than anything I was used to hearing. At The Gates changed that for me. Their music was heavy, but also melodic and the thrashy song structures on Slaughter of the Soul gave me something to go off of since I listened to a lot of Slayer at the time. After spinning Slaughter of the Soul and then Terminal Spirit Disease countless times, I needed to get my hands on more melodeath and, because of that, I did a bit of looking online. It was not long before I stumbled across In Flames and checked out their most recent album Battles expecting some killer melodeath similar to what I knew from At The Gates. As you can probably tell, that is not what I got. \n\nOn their previous album, Siren Charms, In Flames basically left (real) metal altogether. The album was bad and was met with heavy criticism at the time of its release, but oddly enough, despite the return of metal riffing, Battles manages to be far worse than its predecessor. As explained in my review of Siren Charms, I think the album is bad, but it\u2019s blatantly non-metallic nature made it hard for me to outright hate it. It is clear that the band was making a modern rock record and it is not a terrible example of one in my opinion, even though I don\u2019t really care for the genre. Battles, on the other hand, attempts to be simultaneously metallic and radio friendly throughout its entire runtime and ends up a confused mess that fails on both accounts.\n\nThe album starts off with the track \u201cDrained\u201d, which begins with some atmospheric keyboards, clean guitars, and then Anders doing some sort of quiet singing before the song properly begins with a metal riff that is, admittedly, pretty decent. The song continues on with some singing and melodic riffs before it finally happens. The chorus comes and the hilarity ensues. The chorus on this particular track is one of the most pathetic I have ever heard from a metal band in my entire life. It is literally just Anders repeatedly saying \u201cyou ripped her heart out\u201d over and over again in an extremely hamfisted attempt at creating a radio hit. As one might guess from this, the rest of the album doesn't fare much better. \n\nI could go into specific tracks, but this album is so repetitive and one dimensional that the entire thing is just a blur for me despite the fact that I literally just listened to it. Generally speaking, the choruses suck on almost every single song, most of the riffs are uninteresting, the song structures are extremely basic, and the instrumental performances are only slightly less watered down than they were on the previous album. There is not really anything to say other than that aside from how the album occasionally manages to sink even lower than usual. For example, on the song \u201cTruth\u201d where the intro to the song is kids (probably the main target demographic for this album) clapping and repeating \u201cwe are, we are\u201d over and over again ad nauseam. It is absolutely cringeworthy. That is the best way to describe the music on Battles as a whole really. \n\nNormally I go into the line up and discuss the performances themselves, but I\u2019m going to try and keep this as short as possible. Bar none, the most noteworthy thing on this album are Anders Friden\u2019s clean vocals that take up the vast majority of its runtime. Despite being criticized on previous albums for not being a very good singer, I\u2019ve personally never hated Anders\u2019 vocals even though I can see why they wouldn\u2019t be everyone's cup of tea. For me, I think his vocals are comparable to people like Dave Mustaine or Dani Filth in the sense that they are sort of weird, but fit the music. After listening to these bands for a long time I just sort of get used to them. With that being said, clean singing was never his strength and here on Battles he sounds absolutely terrible. These are some of the wimpiest vocals I have ever heard on a (using this term loosely) metal record. They attempt to mimic rock singers like Benjamin Burnley and Chester Bennington, but unlike the aforementioned singers, Anders' vocals sound extremely forced and awkward. His vocals literally sound like a 40+ year old man attempting to appeal to early adolescents because, well, that's exactly what they are. It is pretty embarrassing. As for everything else, the guitarists on here play some decent riffs occasionally, but generally their riffs are generic or extremely simplistic in the vein of Siren Charms. There are occasionally guitar leads that call back to In Flames\u2019 glory days but they feel forced and out of place in the music. The bass is basically inaudible throughout the albums entire runtime and the drumming brought forth by newcomer Joe Rickard is extremely bland. Overall, the performances on the album are not good. \n\nIn the end, Battles is an awful album and stands as the lowest rated In Flames album (on most sites at least) for a reason. The music on here is basically a soulless cash grab played by has been musicians that really just need to stop. It is a good thing that 16 year old me was smart enough to check out the band's earliest material after hearing this, because otherwise I probably would have skipped them for years. The band would later pick up some of the slack left by this album on I, The Mask, but that album was also heavily damaged by this and the preceding record, despite being somewhat of a comeback. This is the kind of album that appeals to people that listen to radio rock like Linkin Park exclusively and, as a result, I cannot recommend Battles to any metal fan, regardless of their taste. Avoid at all costs.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m going to be honest, the first time I heard In Flames\u2019 2014 album, Siren Charms, I thought it sucked hard. So hard, in fact, that I never wanted to listen to it again. Siren Charms marks yet another turning point in In Flames\u2019 lengthy career in that it is the first album in the band\u2019s entire discography that was nearly universally panned by fans of both their old and new style. Depending on what music website you are using, Siren Charms typically holds the lowest or second lowest average out of all the band\u2019s full-length albums. Since I am reviewing the band\u2019s entire discography it was inevitable that I would have to relisten at some point to get my thoughts on the album together and I can\u2019t say I was looking forward to it. With that being said, upon revisiting the album, Siren Charms wasn\u2019t quite as bad as I remembered.\n\nThe music on Siren Charms is what I would consider a clear cut example of alternative metal. There is a large amount of rock influence on the album and there is also a lot of emphasis on radio friendly choruses and clean singing. Due to this, Siren Charms is probably the least metallic album that the band has ever made. There are some melodic metal riffs and guitar leads present that hint at the band\u2019s glory days, but they are only utilized occasionally and, when they are, they are extremely watered down in order to keep with the radio friendly style of the album. \n\nAs bad as this may sound, I personally think that it sort of works at points. The opening track, \u201cIn Plain View\u201d, for example, has some catchy riffs and the melodic guitar lead in the chorus was one of the only things that stood out to me the first time I listened to the album years ago. Another track that is pretty decent is \u201cThrough Oblivion\u201d which has some catchy keyboard parts and singing that I found to be enjoyable even though it\u2019s not really metal. Aside from these two songs the only other noteworthy tracks on the album are \u201cWhen the World Explodes\u201d, which contains some pretty sounding female singing and finally the track \u201cEverything\u2019s Gone\u201d which is the only heavy track on the entire album. I don\u2019t think the track is particularly good, but it's out of place intensity sticks out on an otherwise slow and radio friendly album. The track contains some heavy and groovy riffs along with one that sounds sort of hardcore inspired, but it really isn\u2019t anything other than passible. The rest of the music on the album just sort of goes in through one ear and out the other. Some of the choruses land and are somewhat enjoyable, but a lot of them, especially in the latter half of the album, don\u2019t. Most of the album is just bland without being offensive enough to cause irritation. While listening to this in preparation for this review, I kept being reminded of mid to late era Disturbed (a band that I used to listen to a lot when I was in my early teen years) due to how simplistic metal riffs occasionally come in and out of the music while the focus is mainly placed on rock choruses. \n\nAs for the performances themselves, the album is generally well played in spite of it\u2019s blandness. Anders Friden obviously handles the vocal work on Siren Charms and he has basically abandoned harsh vocals all together here, instead opting to force the listener to endure his mediocre cleans for most of the albums runtime. His vocals aren\u2019t outright awful, but I sure as hell don\u2019t want to listen to a 45 minute long record of them. The only exception to this is on the aforementioned song \u201cEverything\u2019s Gone\u201d where his vocals are harsh at a few points. Unlike the previous record, the band decided to hire an additional guitarist to replace Jesper Stromblad and they decided to go with Niclas Engelin, who is mostly known for his work in the alternative metal band Engel and the melodic death metal band Gardenian. I am not very familiar with either of these bands, but on Siren Charms this guy, along with Bjorn Gelotte, bring forth quite possibly the weakest guitar performances in the entire In Flames catalog. There are almost no guitar leads to speak of and the riffs are only occasionally good. I honestly don\u2019t think there is a single solo on the album either. Their playing isn\u2019t bad from a technical perspective, but the songwriting is extremely watered down. As for the other instruments, Peter Iwers, who plays bass, and Daniel Svensson, the drummer, go almost completely unutilized. The former doesn\u2019t ever play anything noticeable and the latter just plays simplistic drum beats for most of the album. Once again, this is more the fault of the writing than the musicians. \n\nTo sum up, this album has issues that mostly stem from it\u2019s watered down approach to writing songs. A lot of people proclaim this to be the worst In Flames album and I personally do not blame them for doing so. While not unlistenable, this is not the kind of music that I (or anyone else really) want this band to be playing and, as a result, it is not surprising that this album was panned. With that being said, if you are a hardcore fan of this band I would still suggest you give the album a listen on the off chance that you might find redeeming value. For everyone else, I would steer clear.\n",
        "\nSo far in my review series on In Flames, I\u2019ve mostly focused on the later era of the band because there is simply a lot more to say about their later albums. Controversy often gives me more to go off of when writing reviews for albums because it provides room for a somewhat unique take on whatever it is that is being discussed. With that being said, I made it a personal goal to review every full-length in this band\u2019s extensive career, so I thought that I might as well start the band\u2019s classic period off with one of my all time favorite metal albums, Clayman. \n\nInitially released in the year 2000, Clayman is the final album of In Flames\u2019 classic era and the last to feature a heavy emphasis on melodic death metal riffing and heavy/power metal inspired guitar leads. As some reviewers have pointed out on here already, the album also contains some groovier riffing, clean vocals, and keyboard usage that foreshadowed the style that the band would later play on Reroute To Remain. With that being said, \u201cpower melodeath\u201d, as another reviewer on here put it, is probably the best way to sum up the style of the album as a whole.\n\nThe album starts off with \u201cBullet Ride\u201d which is a perfect example of what one can come to expect from Clayman as a whole. The opening riff is excellent and the pounding drums and punchy production is bound to get the listeners blood flowing. After this introduction, the song heads into an acoustic verse with a sort of whispered singing before finally entering an extremely catchy chorus in which the metal returns with a melodic guitar lead that complements the chorus perfectly. Most of the songs on the album in general have a decent amount of similarities to this track and put a lot of emphasis on having the aforementioned catchy choruses and guitar leads, which is something that also appeared on the album\u2019s predecessor, Colony. Songs like \u201cSwim\u201d, \u201cSuburban Me\u201d, \u201c...as the Future Repeats Today\u201d, and the title track are all great examples of this band truly firing on all cylinders and cranking out hard hitting, catchy metal tracks that have truly stood the test of time. \n\nOther noteworthy tracks include \u201cAnother Day in Quicksand\u201d and \u201cOnly for the Weak\u201d, the former of which is actually the most \u201coldschool In Flames\u201d sounding track on the album. This particular song is mostly driven by tremolo picked melodic death metal riffs that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on an album like Whoracle or even The Jester Race. \u201cOnly for the Weak\u201d, on the other hand, is the most \u201cmodern\u201d sounding song on the album and this is by no means a bad thing. This song is probably the most well known In Flames song in general and for good reason. It is extremely catchy in every possible respect. Both of these tracks are great additions to the album that add variety to an already excellent release.\n\nAs with all In Flames material, the performances on Clayman are excellent across the board. Starting off, Anders Frieden\u2019s vocal changed on this album to a high pitched shrieking style that is pretty different from the growling that he did on the previous three albums. While different, these vocals are energetic and their unusual nature adds a charm to the album that makes it sound unique. In addition to the shift in harsh vocal delivery, Anders started doing a lot more singing on this album than he ever had on previous releases. His \u201cclean\u201d vocals here are mostly those whispered vocals that appeared a few times on albums like Colony and Whoracle, but there are just a lot more parts containing them in general. These vocals add variation to the album and while they aren\u2019t really a highlight, they are decent enough for what they are. The guitars on this album are handled by Jesper Stromblad and Bjorn Gelotte (because of course they are) and these guys knew how to write some straight up killer riffs and guitar leads when they were in their prime. The guitar work on this album absolutely shreds and you would be hard pressed to find a riff or guitar lead that didn\u2019t rule. Even the simple groovy/chuggy riffs that show up occasionally don\u2019t feel out of place in the music. The drumming on the album is handled by Daniel Svensson and it is also excellent stuff. The drumming is fast and there is a lot of double bass work throughout the album. The bass on the other hand is basically lost in the flurry of other instruments, so, like most other In Flames releases, Peter Iwers\u2019 bass work goes unnoticed. \n\nOne last thing to make note of is the production on this album. Friedrik Nordstrom mixed this album and he must have used up the production that was meant for the following two albums in the process, because this album sounds fantastic and is lightyears ahead of the shitty production jobs that would plague both Reroute To Remain and Soundtrack to Your Escape. The production is some of the hardest hitting I\u2019ve ever heard and every instrument, aside from the bass, can be clearly heard throughout the album's entire duration. I\u2019ve heard people say online that the production on this album is famous for being so well executed and I can definitely see that being the case. \n\nAfter reading my other reviews for this band, one might think that I prefer their later material or even dislike their older stuff, considering how much I have talked about it, but that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. I started with old In Flames and old In Flames will always be the best In Flames. While it may not be as \u201celite\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d as something like \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d or \u201cSubterranean\u201d, Clayman stands as an excellent example of this band before they watered down their sound to follow trends and make money. In the end, I would highly recommend that anyone who likes power or melodic death metal check this album out. I can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll like it, but it is definitely worth a shot. \n\nRecommended tracks (aside from the whole album of course): \n\"Clayman\"\n\"Swim\"\n\"Suburban Me\"\n\"Bullet Ride\"\n",
        "\nThis album baffles me. And not just because it's In Flames continuing to forsake their long-gone signature style in favor of crap. It's a full-blown ripoff of everything about mainstream heavy rock music. What is there to gain by doing this? In Flames aren't fooling anyone with their act, because underneath the juvenile aesthetic of their music they're a bunch of middle-aged men who are trying to sound and act like they're in their early 20s. Anyone who hears this can tell immediately that it's not genuine. It's deliberately dumbed down to try and shift units. I'd rather listen to Breaking Benjamin, who have some genuinely solid material here and there, over this abomination any day. To create this album, In Flames went beyond the directionless mess that was Siren Charms and ratcheted the crappiness up another notch by taking everything bad that you thought you knew about modern heavy rock and exaggerating it massively. \n\n\"Battles\" is a very deliberately constructed album. By that I mean it feels, at every turn, like it is trying incredibly hard to be something that will sell, to be something that kids who listen to Three Days Grace and their peers will enjoy. From the copy-and-paste arrangements to the dumbed-down riff craft to the corny techno bits (which go perfectly with the album's horrid neon cover), everything is simply embarrassing. I never thought that the classic In Flames style was anything to be worshiped, but it was good and unique enough to the point where, at the rare times when something that resembles those days pops up on this album, all I can do is scream \"WHY? WHY??\", Fantano-style. Most of this isn't even metal, of course. It's plodding alternative rock with a vague metallic overtone. There's one fast song, \"Through My Eyes\", that is a Come Clarity-like thrasher on the surface, but it's completely torpid, feeling like a low-effort attempt to convince the old fans \"hey, we're still aggressive and metal!\". Everything else is mid-tempo, follows pop song structures and has numerous sections that are deliberately constructed to be catchy, like occasional repeated phrases (\"I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands\") and the children's choir and clapping in \"The Truth\", which is simply sickening. Now, they certainly succeed in being catchy, and sometimes almost tolerable. \"Here Until Forever\" actually has a really promising chorus, which might have been great if the lyrics were re-written with a higher level of intelligence and the guy behind the microphone was ejected from the band immediately and replaced with someone who could actually sing. Same thing with \"In My Room\". Bad lyrics and bad vocals, really promising melodies. It certainly makes you want to sing along, as I'm sure it was meant to. \n\nAnders Frid\u00e9n really tries to \"step up his game\" in the vocal department on this record by moving away even more from harsh vocals and doing tons of clean singing all over the place, but even Howard Benson's infamous abuse of Auto-Tune can't hide how much of a shitty, shitty singer he is. He emits whiny accents at the end of each line and breathes heavily in between lines, not to mention relying on studio tech to pull him through lines he just can't do naturally. There are some laughably fake high notes in \"Underneath My Skin\", \"Through My Eyes\" and \"Save Me\" that he could never pull off live, so why even record them in the first place? He simply doesn't have it in him to be a good clean singer, but he tries oh-so-hard to do it anyway, even making a horribly embarrassing attempt at aping Adam Gontier's signature rasp in \"Before I Fall\". When he does scream, it's absolutely unbearable, as his tone is inconsistent as hell and sometimes he loses it completely and spirals into a horrible strangled whining-yelling sound (see \"Drained\" and \"Save Me\" for possibly the worst recorded unclean vocal performances of his career). He sounds like the fucking Underoath guy, and that's probably the sound he was going for, unfortunately. Supposedly Anders went to see a vocal teacher before this album (at the request of Howard Benson, no less!) but he obviously didn't learn enough, because all the clean vocal lines are processed to the point where he almost sounds like a robot whining about vague emotional distress, and he sounds like he un-learned everything he ever knew about decent-sounding unclean vocals. And, of course, in literally any live video where they perform this shit, he fails miserably at performing any of the clean singing competently.\n\nThe album's production job is a perfect example of the complete neutering filter of all heavy elements that a lot of modern rock goes through. How they manage to always turn things that, by nature, sound heavy and aggressive into limp and weak-sounding things amazes me. The guitar tone is distorted, but horribly thin and powerless. The drums are lifeless and machine-like, both in sound and playing. The bass is inaudible, except on \"Through My Eyes\" and \"The End\" where it creeps into the mix and, of course, doesn't sound special. On top of all that, the mix and tones get inconsistent as the album goes on. There's a slightly different guitar and drum sound from \"The End\" to \"In my Room\" which reappears throughout the album (possibly most noticeable on \"Wallflower\"), making it seem like half of it was recorded in a separate studio or something. I suppose it's safe to say that not that much thought was put into consistency in that department of the record, or any other department, really, given the band's discussion of drinking tons of beer and eating barbecue all day during recording in their interviews and official statements leading up to this album.\n\nI can't take Battles seriously. It isn't the band trying new things. They're trying old things that have been done by many already, and in a far less annoying and soulless manner too, I might add. It simply doesn't make sense to me why such a drastic musical shift like this would take place, especially one that has almost nothing in it that originally made this band recognizable and respected. Even more mind-boggling is their statement on their website about this album, which says that \"in a music scene full of seemingly endless subgenres and transient trends, In Flames are an example of what it means to steadfastly stay true to your vision\", and that they have \"[never ceased] to push their own signature sound forward\". Nothing could be farther from the truth. If you don't believe me, listen to this album if you dare.\n",
        "\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that no one likes it when one of their favorite metal bands changes their sound in order to appeal to a wider, more mainstream audience. Metallica infamously did this on the \u201cblack album\u201d causing many other thrash metal bands (Megadeth, Anthrax etc.) to follow suit and release material that was controversial to put it mildly. What In Flames did on Reroute To Remain and the albums to follow is essentially the 2000\u2019s equivalent of this, with the main difference being that In Flames were following the trends of the time rather than setting new ones. Like with Metallica\u2019s black album and the far more heavily criticized follow ups, Load and Reload, old fans of In Flames were completely sideswiped by the sudden stylistic changes that the band undertook here on Reroute To Remain and the album has been bashed because of it ever since. However, ever since the album's release in 2002, many fans of In Flames have actually warmed up to this album (and era of the band in general) now that all of the hype surrounding its initial release almost 19 years ago has died down. With that being said, I personally believe that Reroute To Remain is yet another one of In Flames\u2019 underrated efforts. \n\nOne of the main benefits of being new to bands (or metal genres in general) is that any biases or preconceived notions of what bands \u201cshould\u201d sound like are almost completely absent. This album came out when I was 2 years old, so when I got into this band around the age of 16 I was not caught off guard by the band's change in sound. It was already an established fact that In Flames was no longer a melodic death metal band by that point and, because of that, there was no room for me to get mad about this era existing. That was just how it was. Due to this, I listened to this album (and their other albums) on their own terms, without expecting Colony or The Jester Race even though those were the albums I started with. To be perfectly honest, I initially did not like Reroute To Remain, but after a few listens I warmed up to it and have been jamming ever since. \n\nContrary to what angry old fans may tell you, the music on Reroute To Remain is not \u201cnu-metal\u201d nor is it the kind of stuff you are going to hear when you turn on your local modern rock radio station. Reroute To Remain is a melodic death/groove metal album with alternative inspired choruses and keyboards. With that being said, the music on Reroute To Remain is probably the most aggressive this band has sounded since Lunar Strain outside of the catchy alternative parts. Examples of this include songs like \u201cEgonomic\u201d and \u201cTransparent\u201d, the latter of which actually has a blast beat section, which is not something that happens on the band\u2019s earlier material. These songs and most of the album in general, contain fast riffs and drumming along with harsh, screamed vocals. Aside from this, the album also has a lot of the melodeath influence from the band\u2019s previous albums present, taking form in the melodic guitar riffs and leads that can be heard in songs like \u201cTrigger\u201d and \u201cDark Signs\u201d. In general the music on the album is pretty well executed and the alternative influenced choruses on songs like \u201cTrigger\u201d and \u201cSystem\u201d are extremely catchy and memorable. While there are a few tracks on the album that aren\u2019t as memorable as the others, overall I would say that Reroute To Remain is a pretty consistent listen. \n\nWith all that being said, this is by no means a perfect album. One of the biggest problems here is that the actual production on the album is straight up weird. The drums, while not a huge issue, sound pretty loud and overproduced and there are a lot of unnecessary vocal effects on Anders Friden\u2019s harsh vocals. The best way I can describe it is that his vocals sound distorted and it doesn\u2019t sound good at all. I assume that this was done to make the album sound \u201cedgier\u201d or something to appeal to the scene kids, but it really just sounds bad. Aside from that, the rest of the production sounds fine for the most part.\n\nAs for the performances themselves, the band do a pretty good job here overall. Obviously, all the vocals on the album are handled by Anders Friden and, aside from the bad production, his vocals sound about the same as they did on Clayman. Most of the vocals here are raspy shrieks in the same vein, but there is a larger emphasis here on clean singing. Previous In Flames releases sort of toyed with this, but the band had not embraced it to this degree. These clean vocals are mostly heard on the choruses to the songs and then the two acoustic tracks on the album. While he's definitely not the most talented singer in the world, I personally have always felt that Friedens vocals fit the band well on most of their material. As for the other band members, Jesper Stromblad and Bjorn Gelotte play lots of killer riffs and guitar leads here that are bound to get stuck in the listeners head after a few listens. The guitar work on the album isn\u2019t as well done as it was on the band\u2019s previous albums (they did go commercial after all), but it's still great stuff. As for the drumming, Daniel Svensson plays on this album and also does a pretty good job. There is a lot of double bass work and fast, thrashy drumming throughout. Lastly, Peter Iwers plays bass on this album and, while you can hear it at some points, he plays nothing noteworthy. \n\nOverall, Reroute To Remain is a pretty good album. While I can understand that metal purists and people who hate anything mainstream will dislike this, I feel that a lot of the hate surrounding the middle era of this band is unwarranted. There is a lot to like about albums like Reroute To Remain and if you leave this website and head on over to one where albums are rated by users, you\u2019ll come to find that this era of the band isn\u2019t really poorly rated in general. Reroute To Remain is by no means mandatory listening, but if you are an open minded fan of this band or prefer more accessible types of metal music, Reroute To Remain is worth checking out. \n\nHighlights: \n\"Trigger\" \n\"Egonomic\" \n\"Transparent\" \n\"Drifter\"\n",
        "\nOut of all of the albums in In Flames\u2019 discography, Soundtrack to Your Escape seems to be the one that gets the most heat from the Str\u00f6mblad era. While I can certainly see someone disliking this album, the low ratings on here seem hyperbolic to me to say the least. In Flames\u2019 adoption of alternative metal stylings on Reroute to Remain left a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of the fans who liked their old material, so it isn\u2019t too surprising that those same fans would be less than enthused when the album\u2019s follow up went even farther into alternative metal territory. It is my understanding that this album was completely trashed by almost everyone in the metal scene when it came out due to it being considered another \"sellout\" album. With 16 years passing since then and the hype surrounding its release mostly dead, I think that it is a lot easier to evaluate the album on its own merits rather than comparing it to the band\u2019s back catalogue. \n\nThe music on Soundtrack to Your Escape is odd to say the least. If you showed this album to someone who was unfamiliar with the band and then showed them a song off of Whoracle or The Jester Race they would probably not be able to tell it was the same band. Hell, the music on here doesn\u2019t even sound like Reroute to Remain really, aside from the vocals. Soundtrack to Your Escape is a hodgepodge of different genres including groove metal, industrial rock, alternative rock, and, of course, some of the melodic death metal stylings of old In Flames. All of this culminates forming a strange sounding type of alternative metal. \n\nIn many of the songs featured on Soundtrack to Your Escape, there is a pretty large emphasis on keyboards, which was something that was toyed with on previous In Flames\u2019 releases, but not on this scale. These keyboards combine with electronic sound and vocal effects, along with heavily triggered drums giving the album an industrial sound that no other album in the In Flames discography has. One of the most obvious examples of this can be found in the track \u201cThe Quiet Place\u201d which is probably the most famous song from the album in general. The song is bound to make the purists roll their eyes, but honestly it is one of my favorite songs on the album. The electronic aspect results in a very catchy keyboard lead that plays over grooving riffs and then later on in the song, Anders\u2019 various vocal styles layer on top of each other with electronic effects creating what is an extremely catchy chorus. In fact, the choruses are excellent on a lot of the album in general. It is no secret that In Flames was trying to appeal to mainstream audiences here and they clearly put a lot of effort into making the choruses on these songs memorable. Songs like \u201cBorders and Shading\u201d and \u201cTouch of Red\u201d, for example, also feature catchy choruses that are bound to get stuck in the listeners head after a listen or two, adding a lot of replayability to some of the songs. \n\nWhile both the choruses and the industrial influences add a lot to the album, they also cause Soundtrack to Your Escape to fall flat in other areas. Due to the large emphasis on catchiness, the band doesn\u2019t riff as hard here as they did on previous albums. Some of the songs on the album feature chugging riffs that honestly suck to put it bluntly. An example of this can be seen in the verses of the song \u201cDead Alone\u201d where the riffs do a kind of stop-start chugging that sounds bland and uninspired, hurting an otherwise decent track. Similar things happen at various points in the album which drags it down in my opinion. Another thing to note is that when the choruses and keyboard parts happen on a lot of the songs, the riffs also just start strumming power chords like a rock song or something rather than continuing to play metal, which may bore some listeners. Personally, I like genres besides metal so I don\u2019t really care too much but I would be lying if I said that the guitar work in these parts was interesting. One last thing to make note of about the style of music here is that a few of the songs featured on Soundtrack to Your Escape are mostly fast, straightforward metal where the alternative parts of the band's sound take a backseat and metal riffs and fast drumming prevail. These tracks include \u201cSuperhero of the Computer Rage\u201d, \u201cIn Search For I\u201d, and the album opener \u201cF(r)iend\u201d, which all go for a more aggressive approach as opposed to the catchy feel of the rest of the album.\n\nAfter reading all of this, one might be thinking that the rating that I have given should be higher considering that I have mostly talked about the positives of the album rather than the negatives, but to be honest, while I don\u2019t think there is anything too terrible about the music on Soundtrack to Your Escape, I do think that some of it is just bland and repetitive without being unlistenable. The last song on the album, \u201cBottled\u201d, for example, is just boring in my opinion. Some of the other songs on the album have moments where they become great, but also some where I just kind of nod along without being too engaged. I think there is enough of that going on in the album as a whole for me to dock points. \n\nLastly, I think it is worth touching on the instrumental performances on the album in general. The lineup on Soundtrack to Your Escape is the exact same one that the band had on the previous three records. Obviously, Anders Friden handles the vocals on the album and I think that he does a decent job here. Gone are the horrible sounding vocal effects that he used on Reroute to Remain, making his harsh vocals sound pretty decent here. I also think that his clean singing improved on this album as well, which is nice to hear. The guitar work is handled here by Jesper Stromblad and Bjorn Gelotte and it is decent despite being a far cry from their best work. There are a few solos on the album, but they are so forgettable that they aren\u2019t really worth talking about in detail but the guitarists redeem themselves by providing a decent amount of good riffs throughout the album, which is exactly what I need when it comes to metal. The drum work on the album is handled by Daniel Svensson and he plays a lot of groovy drum patterns throughout the album along with some double bass and even a blast beat at one point, which isn\u2019t a common occurrence for In Flames. Lastly, the bass handled by Peter Iwers is almost completely inaudible so there isn\u2019t anything to say. Overall the performances on the album are pretty good, but it's In Flames. What did you expect? Even their bad material is played competently. \n\nLooking back, this was a pretty long review. The longest I have ever written to this point, actually, but I think that there is just a lot of stuff to talk about when it comes to controversial albums like this. In the end, I strongly believe that Soundtrack to Your Escape is a pretty solid album. The album is by no means mandatory listening, but if you like this band, particularly if you like their later albums like Come Clarity I would recommend that you check it out at the very least. Honestly, I avoided this album like the plague for years because people told me that it was \u201cnu-metal trash\u201d and things like that, but when I actually sat down and gave it an honest shot, I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe you will be too.\n\nHighlights: \n\u201cThe Quiet Place\u201d \n\u201cBorders and Shading\u201d\n\u201cSuperhero of the Computer Rage\u201d\n",
        "\nThis is in the hall of shame, of the rock and metal music. Inexplicably but yet understandably. Fans of In Flames find this workof the most disappointing catastrophe to metal music, they consider this like a proper treason, as Stromblad has cheated on them.\n\nThe question is: is it really that bad? Close your eyes, think about Amaranthe, Avenged Sevenfold, Bullet for my Valentine, All That Remains, Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth, Children of Bodom, Fleshgod Apocalypse... and all the folk and viking metal overrated stuff out there. Repeat the question to yourself multiple times, then ask if it actually is. My answer would be no. I would explain you why. \n\nWe aren't here to make comparisons, but first of all, I would say if we compare it to all the monstrosity In Flames produced afterwards this is a pure masterpiece. But let's go straight to the point: this isn't the best, but actually not even the worst. These are the In Flames for the great audience, these are the In Flames for the arenas, In Flames for fans of 30 Seconds to Mars. Jester race is In Flames for adults as STYE is In Flames for kids, in the same way as \"Laibach is Rammstein for adults and Einsturzende Neubaten is Stockhausen for kids\". Definitely not the worst ever. Soundtrack to your Escape shows a band bare, naked and barebone, with Stromblad suffering of addiction from every possible shit, a Stromblad who is got tired but has nothing left to tell, because the previous era has finished and now it's time to move on. So, the melodeath period is just a distant memory, this a return to the stages of a later adolescence. A problematic one in which choices are complicated and controversial. In the same way this album is.\n\nOpening track - \"F(r)iend\" - is gold: solid, chugging, heavy, rough, explosive, a bulldozer of riffs and blast beat perfectly combined with their melodic dimension. Then it comes, \"The Quiet Place\", the pain intensifies to the purist metalheads, vomiting every plausible insult against it: perfect blend between U2, Depeche Mode and Dark Tranquillity, the track is intense, the chorus is atmospheric, sweet-sour, goes along the line with the wall of sound of guitars and synths. \"Dead Alone\" is that moment when everyone still thinking about good ol' times like a fascist nostalgic commits suicide: blink-182 literally try playing melodic death metal but end up with turning in a good rock 'n' roll song, everything's in the right place - to quote Radiohead - synths, keys, melodies and riffs are doing the right job. \n\nWhatever you may think about this album, like it or not, what is undeniably certain is each track literally different from another, no way you're gonna accuse them with playing the same song throughout the album or every track sounding the same. \"My Sweet Shadow\" could be considered by many the worst, but let's be honest: would you prefer a gamble like this or recycling the same sound from the 1995? This song, which is the hit off this album, is unique in its genre. Robotic, enigmatic, probably an introduction to \"Come Clarity\" and everything which came next: the alternative rock component is strong and pervades the song, that clearly shows a transition sound, quite like the endeavour to leave the past sound behind. The song in itself is melancholic, dramatic, yet catchy, with a strong electronic and ambient influence. Maybe it's banal, hyper seasoned, too much at sake, clearly a commercial song, not the best here and probably the most pathetic together with \"Touch of Red\" but ideas and concepts behind aren't wrong at all: maybe take groove metal to the large audience? Perhaps. \n\nIf we skip over \"Evil in a closet\", which is an enjoyable power ballad but nothing more, \"In Search for I\", personally my favourite, \"Superhero of the Computer rage\" and \"Dial 595\" are absolutely powerful tracks, not the best in their discography for sure, but neither their worst and absolutely on a level in which they could compete to their past albums: the sound is aggressive and melodic at the same time, drumming is solid and so the production overall considered. I don't take too much into consideration \"Bottled\" and \"Boarders and Shading\", which are mediocre tracks, neither bad nor good, just ordinary business as usual, just minor episodes thrown inside the album to fill the gap, however not so bad to let the overall judgement sink. \n\nSo as someone already said here, if you are curious to listen to this album, just don't give absolutely too much importance to what others say. Generally speaking the metal audience is sometimes one of the most closed-minded around and thank God, not everyone into it have the same mentality, but there's too much importance given to how a band is supposed to play, perceiving a change in the style as irremediable threat to the genre, in the same way as race suprematists, for example, prefer their race to stay pure and not mixed with others, otherwise is a treason and a threat to its survival. So, let the treason happen, music is neither black or white, if a band chooses to incorporate trap, jazz, reggae or dub elements in their music, rapping or screamo vocals, metal doesn't die, just chill. \n\nThere's just good and bad music, it doesn't matter what you do, but how. If an album sucks, it just sucks because it sucks, because the musicians are untalented or unable to play an instrument or simply don't have creativity, because their music is repetitive, banal, stupid, bad composed, the production is shitsome... whatever. Not because they play something which isn't in line with the canons of \"trueness\" or is \"modern\" (which doesn't mean absolutely anything). \n\nTo conclude, \"Soundtrack to your Escape\" isn't bad as you think, is a good alternative metal work with solid tracks which are catchy and heavy at the same time. There's really worse out there, even by those \"true metal\" bands who play the same pathetic shit for years, despite having nothing to tell. Because no one is like Necrophagist, who simply made two albums and then ended up their career with \"that's all folks\", instead of still playing around for years. If they came out with a third album, would it has been as same as the previous masterpieces? And what if they would have chosen to become a, eg. industrial hip hop project? Maybe you would argue, in the same way, would have been better if In Flames simply stopped making music. But, I'd be honest, between a band who chooses a paradigm shift instead of a comfort zone, risking to lose all the retarded fans who simply go to their concerts as alternative to an amusement park, not giving a shit if long-haired dumb individuals aren't following them anymore... well, I'd prefer the first one. \n\nRisk is always the name of the game. 70% for the music, 15%, well, to spite in face of critics. Because if this is bad, then it's so bad, that it's good.\n",
        "\nI can't make sense of the fact that this millennium release from legendary melodic groovers In Flames is considered to be their last \"good\" album by one faction of their divided fan base: the side that views their alternative and nu-metal wanderings as \"selling out\" and other negative adjectives. Actually, the downfall of In Flames started right here (not that they were really in a high place to begin with). With this album, there is a noticable shift in style from the melodic groove/power metal hybrid frequently mislabeled as some kind of death metal that they played on Colony, Whoracle, and The Jester Race. As with other classic In Flames releases, there's objectively not much death metal to be found here, mostly because of the lack of speed and atonality. However, there is a lot of nu-metal and alternative rock, perhaps more than some would like to admit. The experiment more or less fails.\n\nThe layered guitar ear candy from previous releases has pretty much been thrown out the window here, to be replaced with things that would be easier to recreate live with just two guitars. In other words, one-note chugging, alternative rock power chords, and hard rock stomping. Rarely does genuine beefy riffing creep in. Just like the untouchable trio of In Flames albums, there are moments that show tons of potential and therefore are really frustrating when they get buried by mush. Case in point: the clean guitars in \"Square Nothing\". Classic In Flames melodies, instantly memorable, and unfortunately offset massively by whispery-whiny singing. Also, the opening of \"Clayman\", which brings a burst of much-needed speed and power metal-styled guitar leads, only to be replaced by chugging in the verses, is a fantastic opening and would make a great album if only they could come up with 10 songs filled with riffs like that. \"Swim\" could have easily been on Colony, and is one of the more riff-driven selections from the album.\n\nMuch of everything else is forgettable. It's not outright shitty, but it sounds lazy and is lacking in energy severely. The intros of \"Bullet Ride\" and \"Pinball Map\" and the verse chugging in \"Only for the Weak\" are some of the laziest riffs in the entire In Flames discography. The first is a hard rock chord progression with phrasing that's predictable beyond measure, the second is one of those \"harmonize it and it'll sound cooler\" riffs, and the third evokes a \"jumpdafuckup\" atmosphere like you've never heard (live performances of it are laughable as Anders yells \"EY! EY!\" at the crowd and they all jump and feebly headbang as one). There you have it. Those three elements are pretty much what this album is made of: nothing remarkable, ranging from listenable to lazy. It's comparable to Helmet's \"Aftertaste\" album. Some of the signature stuff is still there, but it's mostly just uninspired heavy rock music from a band that's out of ideas for once and can't seem to find new ones by experimenting.\n\nIn my In Flames reviews so far, I've devoted at least a paragraph to Anders Frid\u00e9n's voice. His balls dropping in reverse is complete with this album. He shrieks lyrics of vague angst and inner struggles, which fortunately aren't nearly as embarrassing as gems from later albums such as \"I can be as angry as I want to be\". This album is an interesting artifact because it contains, on a studio recording, unprocessed, the extent of Anders' clean singing abilities. Sometimes he actually pulls off a good line. The clean-sung choruses of \"Pinball Map\" and the title track sound dark and muffled, not whiny and hideous like every album that came after this one, and are - wonder of wonders - in tune. But the rest of the time, like on \"Satellites and Astronauts\" and \"Square Nothing\", he adopts a tuneless croaking whisper that's probably meant to sound intense and emotional (it had better with all those effects on it, right?). It doesn't, of course. And on a few songs, he does an unbelievably accurate (that is to say, horrid-sounding) Jonathan Davis impersonation in the form of muttering underneath the main vocals. For crying out loud, the original was bad enough. Frid\u00e9n's performance is just as frustrating as the instruments in the sense that there are tolerable, even good moments, like the deeper growls that show up in \"Swim\" and the aforementioned clean singing. Obviously he can perform kickass vocals in some way, but he's either just too lazy to try most of the time or he somehow thinks that his out-of-tune whining and croaking and screeching sound good.\n\nThis album is held in high esteem by both producers and fans alike as a pinnacle of modern metal production, but I fail to see the genius in it. This is the last time that In Flames worked with Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m, and honestly I prefer the sounds he created for this album's predecessors. The drums here are really thin and clicky (at least they're not the horrible cardboard box banging on Colony), and do very little to reinforce the rhythm section and bottom end. They would sound kind of cool on their own, but you drop them into this mix and they sound like crap. The bass frequencies are very muddy, especially on the first two songs where riffs that are potentially very heavy are killed by the bass playing single notes instead of following the guitars. And the guitar tone... it's good, but better tones have come out of the metal world and Studio Fredman (see Soilwork's Chainheart Machine for possibly the greatest guitar tone ever recorded at Studio Fredman). In this mix, it's nothing special. Overall, the mix isn't very saturated and the individually good sounds of the instruments end up working against each other. \n\nYou guessed it: this isn't a melodic death metal album. It's not even that much of a metal album. \"Square Nothing\" and \"Only for the Weak\" are pure alternative rock, and anyone who thinks otherwise is fooling themselves. I know that some people think it's the last hurrah of this band and view it as a transitional masterpiece and for the life of me, I can't figure out why. Reroute to Remain, the subsequent album and according to many, the real \"turning point\" for this band, has more riffs and more speed, if not more good vocals. A Sense of Purpose, released 8 years after this album, has more of the signature In Flames sound in it. This is just another \"classic\" that I have tried to understand and can't - much like the rest of the In Flames discography.\n",
        "\nSwedish melodic death metal veterans In Flames release another output and the majority of metal fans are shitting all over it once again. So far, that's nothing surprising anymore - except this time the haters are absolutely right. This extended play by the Swedish quintet is by far the worst release in its thirty years of existence. \n\nI must admit that even I had seen that coming. I had defended the band up to and including Siren Charms six years ago. I didn't do so to be contrarian but because I genuinely liked the band's raw take on alternative rock it had been shifting to since the beginning of the millennium. However, some cracks began to show for me on Battles four years ago, an overall unimaginative effort saved by a couple of standout tunes. Last year's I, the Mask was even worse in that regard as that painfully average output was the worst in the band's career up to that point. I had already expected the rerecorded versions of four Clayman tracks from twenty years ago to be underwhelming. However, they are worse than that. They are abysmal to be absolutely honest.\n\nOne thing one shouldn't forget is that Clayman was an incredibly popular record twenty years ago. For those who despise contemporary In Flames, it is the last great album by the Swedish pioneers. For those who have known and appreciated the band over the past two decades, it was the first album they could truly identify with. The songs from this album are still regularly played in concert. I have attended concerts of the bands on multiple occasions and can guarantee you that the Swedish quintet still does these songs justice.\n\nThat isn't the case here however. Everything that could be wrong with these songs actually went wrong. The production is a disaster. It's fluffy, flat and artificial and sounds as if it had been on a particularly low budget. It's not even mellow anymore, it's already soulless. The vocals are lacking energy and especially the melodic parts remind of an unskilled singer of an alternative rock band with purely commercial intentions. The worst offender however is the musicianship. The guitar play sounds toothless and vapid. The rhythm section is missing energy, plodding along and at times barely audible. The bass and drums could come from a cheap computer program and wouldn't sound less convincing and energetic. The result is however worse than its different parts as it feels completely powerless. It's a mystery why and how the band could have been convinced that recording these songs in new versions would be a good idea. Singer Anders Frid\u00e9n had even stated not so long ago that rerecording old material would be absolutely pointless. Sometimes, you should really stick with your first impression.\n\nOne has has to wonder why Clayman was even rereleased at this point. The band's entire back catalog had been remastered and rereleased with bonus material for reasonable prices only six years ago. Clayman in particular had included two excellent bonus tracks and two energetic live songs. This new release here doesn't include those excellent four tracks and opts for four terrible rerecorded tunes and an instrumental track.\n\nThe latter is the only reason why this release even gets more than the worst possible rating.''Themes and Variations in D-Minor'' recalls several tracks from the album in symphonic arrangements that remind of instrumental symphonic metal in the key of Apocalyptica. This song is varied, creative and atmospheric and would fit perfectly on a movie score or video game soundtrack. If you like this type of music, you should appreciate this song. If it isn't your cup of tea, then it would even make sense to give this release the lowest of all ratings.\n\nThere is nothing to say in this release's defense. Don't waste your time as this extended play isn't even worth checking out. If you have lived under a rock and don't own In Flames' Clayman yet, do yourself a favour and go for the excellent remastered rerelease that came out less than six years ago. Let's just cross our fingers and hope that the band won't rerecord any other old songs for potential anniversary editions and has learned from its mistakes. The next regular studio record needs to be a solid step in the right direction to make everyone forget about this abysmal extended play.\n",
        "\nWe, the former fans and fellow travelers, shouldn't be surprised about In Flames records sucking. It's not like we don't know how awful this band has become, it's not like we can't see the vortex of horror coming from miles away. \n\nBut yet again, I find myself listening to this turd of a re-recording - two full decades after the last hooray! of the band reviewed here. Though this time, unlike in previous years of head-scratching horror and powerless meandering, Anders and friends (or paycheck-combatants, I really don't know these days) vomit their obtrusive bile right over one of their eternal classics. \n\nThese re-recordings however, serve absolutely no purpose. Maybe these guys actually wanted to infuriate the last bulk of the old fan guard to see how much more it could take before finally - ultimately - abandoning ship but in reality, this is probably nothing more than another attempt at luring people into the mush that is their \u201cmodern\u201d sound. \n\nIt's incredibly sad to hear the grandiose melodies of 2000s Clayman regurgitated within the production values of a low-tier alternative rock band. The guitar tone is so feeble and thin, it makes the original sound twice as good and thrice as heavy (and that album had pretty much a fantastic Studio Fredman production) while Anders Friden sounds like...well, what the noise coming out of his mouth sounded like this past decade, maybe just a tad bit less annoying than on the late Linkin Park tribute that was Battles or Siren Charms or Angst Clowns or whatever these indistinguishable, rotten records were called when they were released to a crowd that couldn't care less.\n\nTo be eligible to have the creativity stamp put on their foreheads, the band decided to switch a few things around in the songwriting department aka fucking up the originals where they should have not been touched. A good example is the bridge section of \u201cPinball Map\u201d, which now features a shittier variation of the the original breakdown with some additional, yet unnecessary (simplistic) lead guitars and some keyboard effects floating atop the now-inferior riff and the modern Friden crying his lyrics over what were originally growls delivered by his younger, beardless (meaning serviceable) self. \n\nThe only thing worth a penny (but only if you truly consider the original Clayman to be part of their prime) is the classical best-of arrangement \u201cThemes and Variations in D-Minor\u201d. It's a medley fleshed out of a variety of melodies from all over the album, presented through string instruments. Since the mix is so bad and there's hardly any dynamic range to be found here, I'm still not able to discern whether some of these strings are not just VSTi-plugins but who gives a damn anyway because if I want to hear this album in a version that actually matters, I'm just gonna turn around in my chair and dust off the original record. \n\nClayman never needed a remastering, a sequel or similarly ridiculous treatment. I know it's been kind of in vogue to trash In Flames since the release of Soundtrack to Your Escape back in 2004 but I'm actually not one of these people. Up until Sounds of a Playground Fading this band had still managed to churn out two or three decent tracks per record before nose-diving into the feces trench full-circle. \n\nWhatever they do these days is predestined to be an epic failure and it seems they are not only perfectly aware of this fact, but profoundly enjoying their ride through the sewers.\n\noriginally written for http://antichristmagazine.com\n",
        "\nIt is no secret that In Flames changed their original melodic death metal sound after the release of Clayman to a melodic groove/alternative metal one. Due to this shift, along with accusations of selling out, their albums from Reroute to Remain onward are controversial in the fanbase to say the least, despite doing fairly well commercially. With this being said, the band brought a lot of their old fans back on board with Come Clarity in 2006 by combining good songwriting with some of the old melodic death metal stylings that their previous two efforts were lacking in. Because of this, people were excited for the album\u2019s follow up, A Sense of Purpose, and were hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately, like with Reroute to Remain and Soundtrack to Your Escape, the album was met with mixed reception when it was released. With that being said, I personally feel that A Sense of Purpose is one of In Flames\u2019 most underrated efforts. \n\nThe album opens with a very commercial sounding song entitled \u201cThe Mirror\u2019s Truth\u201d that sounds like a sped up version of what you would expect from the average alternative metal band. The lyrics on the song are fairly basic, but the catchy nature of their delivery combined with the memorable riff work results in what is actually a pretty good track. That being said, I think that this particular single misrepresents the album a bit, as many of the songs to follow are actually more faithful to In Flames\u2019 back catalog than people often give the album credit for. Tracks like \u201cDrenched in Fear\u201d and \u201cSleepless Again\u201d, for example, are filled with modernized versions of the signature guitar leads that are commonly associated with In Flame\u2019s classic period. Aside from this, almost every single song on the album is filled with melodic death/groove metal riffs that sound similar to bands such as Solution .45 and Soilwork, which isn\u2019t quite consistent with the alt-rock sound that is often attributed to the album. This is due to the fact that, unlike the albums to follow, Jesper Stromblad was still writing a lot of the riffs for the band. Another interesting track to make note of is \u201cThe Chosen Pessimist\u201d, which is the longest song in the entire In Flames discography. This track differs heavily from the rest of A Sense of Purpose due to the fact that it is a mostly acoustic ballad that builds up to a massive wall of guitars and synths about 6 minutes in that last the rest of the song. While I can see this stylistic shift alienating listeners who listen to metal exclusively, I think that fans of other genres of music like alternative rock will likely enjoy it. Personally, I think that the song adds quite a bit to the album and it also stands far above most of the trash that the band would start playing after this release. \n\nAside from the songs themselves, the performances on A Sense of Purpose are excellent across the board. Obviously, Anders Friden handles the vocals on the album and, if the listener is familiar with the band\u2019s previous albums, they will notice that his vocals have changed quite a bit since Come Clarity. On A Sense of Purpose, his vocals are nowhere near as harsh as they once were and this complements the melodic nature of the album quite well. For the most part, he seems to have replaced a lot of the screaming and growling that he is known for with gruff singing, but there is still harsh stuff to be found here. His clean vocals are also improved compared to previous releases. Personally, I\u2019ve always loved his vocals, but on a A Sense of Purpose he sounds a lot less whiny and has improved range. Aside from the vocals, the guitar work on the album is handled by Jesper Stromblad and Bjorn Gelotte, just like every In Flames album since the The Jester Race. I already talked a bit about this earlier, but the riffs and melodies on this album are excellent across the board. The album has a lot of guitar leads and melodic riffs played at various different speeds. On top of this, there are also some groovy and rock-like riffs scattered throughout the album that add to the overall sound. The bass on the album is handled by Peter Iwers, who has played on every In Flames release since Colony. Iwers bass work is somewhat audible throughout the album\u2019s duration, but it doesn\u2019t really do anything that is worth mentioning, aside from filling out the lower end of the band\u2019s sound. Finally, the drums on the album are handled by Daniel Svensson, who has also been in the band since Colony. The drum work on the album is excellent throughout and utilizes a lot of double bass on the faster songs. Due to the slower pace of a lot of the songs though, there isn\u2019t too much to say aside from that. \n\nIn the end, I think that A Sense of Purpose was a pretty good note for Jesper to leave the band on. If you are a fan of In Flames from Clayman onward, I think there is a pretty good chance you will dig this album. As for fans who only dig the bands earlier efforts, I could see this being a tough sell due to the alternative/commercial influences in the sound. Even with this being the case, I would advise that any fan of this band check A Sense of Purpose out at least once instead of listening to the negativity that surrounds the album. I didn\u2019t initially dig it, but after a few listens the album grew on me considerably and It hasn\u2019t worn off in the years that I have had the CD. Aside from fans of the band, this album is also a good one for people who are new to the metal genre due to its accessible nature and would certainly be worth checking out if you are having difficulty getting into the harder subgenres.\n",
        "\nThe one thing that In Flames have proven with The Jester Race (and its similar efforts) is that it is possible to be too melodic. This record is stuffed and bloated with harmony after harmony, melody after melody, often with guitar parts so layered that they would need four guitarists to be reproduced live. On their own, the guitar riffs aren't bad. They sound a lot like power metal at times and are quite catchy. The problem is that they're way overused. They all try to stick in your head at once and thus become unmemorable, not to mention sounding the same. Run up and down a minor scale in the key of F or C, add minor 3rd harmonies (because even the dumbest riffs sound cooler with harmonies), layer everything like there's no tomorrow and you've got an In Flames riff. Rinse and repeat for the whole album. Again, this wouldn't be a problem if they weren't overused, but they are, and thus the more memorable parts of the album come when the band actually wakes up, starts putting the \"death\" back in \"melodic death metal\", and ditches the endless harmonies for something a bit more aggressive. Moments like this that come to mind include the thrashy section of \"Graveland\" (which tries to fool you into thinking it's a thrasher all the way through, but actually has a pretty slow triplet rhythm), a part in \"Wayfaerer\" where the guitars - unbelievably - stop harmonizing, and \"Dead God In Me\".\n\nThis album is the first to feature vocalist Anders Friden, the only band member left from this album's lineup who continues on his chosen instrument in the current incarnation of In Flames. His performance here isn't as atrocious as it is on later albums, or in a live setting (at least he doesn't try to sing here), but it still leaves a lot to be desired. He sounds like he's constantly out of breath, throwing himself at the microphone with whiny mid-range growls and occasional spoken word passages. I have to say that this is the only album on which Anders' spoken word passages actually worked - here they sound muffled and gloomy, applying themselves well to the music. On later albums where Anders attempted spoken word passages (it's obvious he wanted to sing, but couldn't and still can't), he sounds like a very tired old man trying to take a crap after eating meat for a week.\n\nThe Jester Race is an album whose style works only for the first few minutes you hear it. You think that In Flames really has something with all these melodies and their instantly recognizable style, but as you drag on past the thirtieth minute, still having your eardrums gently massaged by mid-tempo alternative drum grooves and the same layered harmonies that the album started with, you start to want some variation. An album that did the melodic death metal routine well is Soilwork's \"Chainheart Machine\", which emphasizes the speed and aggression of death metal without abusing melody and harmony, although those elements are still present. In Flames is just wasting a heap of ideas here, which wouldn't be bad if they were used more sparingly.\n",
        "\nIn Flames is a band that has gone through many changes over the years. Its legacy on the Melodic Death Metal scene is undeniable, and whether one likes it or not one has to admire how it has never shied away from venturing on to new sounds: specially in their recent albums, where they veered off to more melodic rock sounds and tried to fuse them with the metal sounds they learned in the 90s. Those efforts were in my opinion more miss than hit, specially in their mid-2010s records Siren Charms and Battles. However, Their latest full-length album, I, The Mask was in my opinion a step in the right direction, finally coming to a consistent Melodic Metal Sound. \n\nI say all of this after years of trying to get used to their new sound, and a few years ago I finally came to terms with it. Long gone were the days of Anders Frid\u00e9n's amazing growls on The Jester Race, the Atmosphere of Whoracle, the Amazing riffs of Colony and the sheer power of Clayman, but I was finally okay with it. 2000's In Flames and 2020's In Flames were completely different bands, and I was supposed to look to the new In Flames' sound as something on its own rather than comparing it to the sound they had so desperately tried to avoid in the past 20 years.\n\nAnd just when I was at peace with their new sound, they release this. A re-record of some of their Clayman hits. Songs that are pretty much perfect on themselves and need no real revisions, specially with Clayman being one of their most significative albums they have ever made. Apparently made as a tribute to the 20th Anniversary of the Album, 2020's Clayman EP reminded me why the original album is so great, all for the wrong reasons. The amazing noisy and straightforward mixing of the original album has been replaced with overproduced instrument tracks, all which form a veiled, layered sound that voids the new version of all the excitement the original had. The loud percussion of Daniel Svensson's drums are nowhere to be found, and the booming bass lines like the ones at the start of \"Pinball Map\" have become sterile, almost silent bass lines. Friden's vocals are in line with his latest singing style, replacing the deep growls and enigmatic melodic voice of the original songs with the more clean vocals and high pitched screams he has done since the 2000s. But the worst crime of the mixing is the one they've done to Jesper Stromblad's legendary guitar melodies, with the new guitar tracks having a generic, weightless muddy sound. One wonders why did Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte come up with the idea of burying his own instrument tracks in the mix in favor of some irrelevant keyboard sounds that add nothing to the new songs. Does he hate himself?\n\nThe Only saving grace of this EP comes in \"Themes and Variations in D-Minor\", a very compelling five-minute string mashup and tribute to the tracks of Clayman. This would have sufficed as an anniversary homage if released as a single, but why did they choose to butcher four of the original album's songs, add them, and release them as an EP? It's pretty clear their sound is nothing like the one they had in 2000, why revisit those sounds right now? Sure this has prompted me to revisit the greatness of 2000's Clayman, but that's something In Flames has done every time they release a new album, so what is there to add to such amazing record?\n\nSo yeah, one good song out of 5, which means 20 out of 100. Make no mistake, if these tracks were released as new ones today, they would certainly be better than anything they have released in the past decade, but that's just a feature inherited from the great songwriting of the original album. The worst thing is, you have to be thankful to these folks for just having desecrated only 4 Clayman songs and not the entire album, and ask them to please, please not touch or revisit anything of their past albums again. Not even their relatively recent ones like A Sense of Purpose. Seeing how the efforts of re-recording an old album have come out this time, we can be sure those albums are as good as they'll ever be.\n",
        "\nThe 2020 COVID pandemic changed the world for everybody, especially musicians. Blocked from playing gigs, their main means of earning a living, they had to improvise new ways of reaching their audiences. Most went straight to streaming, making the most out of limited budgets to provide an interesting experience to the listener. Some metal bands like Shaman managed to put together excellent \"live\" concerts, complete with full interaction with an online crowd and even some onstage bells and whistles like pyrotechnics and light shows to make it feel as close to the real deal as possible. Turns out that even though we missed attending actual concerts, these online events gave us a sense of relative normalcy and allowed us to partake once again (even though on a limited scale) in that social experience whilst allowing the musicians to make some dough alongside their sponsors. In summary, some bands were smart. In Flames, on the other hand, wasn't.\n\nIn order to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of their much-lauded 2000 album Clayman, the Gothenburg quintet announced they would be re-recording it with \"updated\" sounds. Now, mind you, the idea isn't bad per se. Sometimes old albums have great ideas in them, but perhaps due to a lack of experience on the band's part, something might sound off, like an unnecessary arrangement here or there or maybe a faulty mixing job. Dream Theater's debut comes to mind with its solid compositions being brought down by a downright wimpy mix, but you hardly need to go that far; In Flames' own seminal sophomore album The Jester Race could do with a more muscular production. In these cases, it doesn't hurt to go back, have another go at it and breathe new life into the thing. Problem is, the original must be at least somewhat lacklustre in the first place before you go and mess with it, and Clayman is, even to In Flames haters, considered to have one of the finest mixing\\mastering jobs in modern metal. Simply put, it sounds huge to this day and no amount of twiddling with dials was ever necessary after it was out. Nonetheless, here we are. Adding insult to injury (or perhaps in an act of mercy, depending on how you see it), only four of the original eleven songs would be worked on. By this point, a faint stench of money-grubbing pointlessness might be invading your nostrils. Trust your instincts, because this gets pretty stupid, pretty fast.\n\nClayman 2020 is an assortment of four live staples and a middling introductory vignette that Jesper Stromblad, were he still in the band, would probably vote to leave as a b-side somewhere else. The songs are left mostly intact, with some added touches here and there: \"Pinball Map\" gets an extended bridge and some discreet keyboard lines that admittedly work well; the first few bars of the intro of \"Clayman\" are given an 80's synth treatment that fans of kookier power metal bands like Machinae Supremacy might dig, yadda yadda. If it seems like I'm being overly cursory, it's because it's all very inoffensive. Even Anders Frid\u00e9n, who tends to aggravate many a listener with his annoying vocal idiosyncrasies, is remarkably restrained and uninterested throughout. Oh, sure, he's still whiny, but there are no bogus high notes or blatant uses of autotune outside of backing vocals, which came as a surprise to yours truly. For a band that enjoys pushing their post-2002 era as innovative and adventurous, they all sound remarkably conservative here, perhaps out of fear that adding clapping samples, changing the lyrical outlook from cryptic urban nihilism to adolescent hogwash or in any other fashion butchering beloved old songs would send fans into a frenzy. But don't get me wrong, these tracks have always been fine for what they are and I like them quite a bit in the original release. What I certainly can't get behind is re-recording them with such a neutered production job, and thus we arrive on this album's biggest point of contention: It sounds like a wet fart.\n\nGone are Fredrik Nostr\u00f6m robust timbres, replaced by mushy rhythm guitars and hazy leads with a wah-wah effect I surely don't remember being this bothersome back then. Vocals no longer have the gurgly, unsettling layering which gave Frid\u00e9n's performance a great deal of character 20 years ago. The drummer might be hitting like a sledgehammer but you wouldn't really know since the final product is devoid of Daniel Svensson's snappiness. I could go on, but you catch the meaning. Like a taxidermy mount, it may look flashy, but it is ultimately hollow and devoid of life.\n\nOnly Gelotte and Frid\u00e9n know the real reason this pointless exercise exists. From here, it looks like a good 'ole cash grab or a contractual obligation at best. I'd much rather watch a concert of them playing all original tracks and calling it a day. Unless we're witnessing some mad 4D chess moves and this is some marketing ploy for an upcoming tour featuring exclusively pre-Reroute to Remain material (hey, one can dream), Clayman 2020 is D.O.A, so skip it. Someday we'll look back to these troubling times and see that some things remained untouched, like modern In Flames's ever-consistent ability to disappoint.\n",
        "\nIn Flames has certainly been a controversial band, and it seems that they keep digging themselves a deeper hole with everything they do. Some of it is deserved, some of it not so much. This case is the former.\n\nI haven't been a fan of the band for the longest time, just about four or so years, but they have been my favorite band ever since I first listened to their works. Are they perfect? No. Are they the best? Also no. However, they are and will always be one of the greats. I'm perfectly willing to enjoy and defend mostly everything they do, save for Siren Charms and Battles. No matter what you think about the older stuff or the newer stuff, the announcement of the re-recordings sounds like something everyone would love- And these really should've been. Aside from the biggest purists and the few you just can't please, this is something that would've catered to everyone, yet few are happy with the quality of the products.\n\nThe production and mixing is atrocious, courtesy of Howard Benson and Chris Lord-Alge respectively. The guitar tones in the songs range from 'decent, but the original was still better' to 'this is worse than royalty-free instruments'. The drums are just weird altogether. One minute they sound fine, the next they're just completely out of sync. In some instances, it's the playing, but in other instances, it's just that the cymbals are louder than they should be, and the drums lack the punch necessary to carry the beat. The bass is inaudible, and is probably the most inoffensive thing here. Anders' vocals are a mixed bag. His harsh vocals sound perfectly fine, and they work incredibly well. However, aside from on the title track, his clean vocals ruin the rest of the songs. It's a shame because his vocals otherwise are the best things about the re-recordings.\n\nThere's one saving grace here: \"Themes and Variations in D-Minor\". Composed by Johannes Bergion, who previously worked with the band composing the strings for \"A New Dawn\" off of Sounds of a Playground Fading (Which is arguably one of the best songs in their discography), he does such a phenomenal job of weaving many of the songs from the album together. If there's one thing you should listen to, it's this song. Don't bother with the re-recordings. I reviewed the title track, and it's the most positivity you'll get out of me for those songs. I hope the band works more with Bergion in the future because he's the best thing going for this EP.\n",
        "\nEarly In Flames albums have got to be some of the most frustrating albums I\u2019ve ever listened to. Not because they\u2019re bad necessarily. More because they have the potential to be these great amazing albums that I\u2019d always heard about them being ever since I got into metal. Between the guitar harmonics, the twin-guitar melodies and the oftentimes smooth rhythm sections, these guys had all the right ideas to make this power metal-laden death metal kind of thing often called melodeath work wonders! I mean, it does \u2013 but you have to listen to older Dark Tranquility records and Raintime\u2019s first album to see that. In Flames\u2019 problem is that often, after they blaze through the gates with a hectic intro containing some sick ass harmonics, the songs just chug along, existing in the background and doing little else. It comes to a head with the last album they put out in the 20th century, Colony. Boy, this is going to be fun...\n\n...especially since \u201cEmbody the Invisible\u201d opens the album with aplomb, but it also embodies pretty much everything that In Flames stood for back in the day. I mean, this is exactly what you\u2019d think of when you think of In Flames \u2013 the harmonic leads introduce the song in a remarkably flashy fashion, and they permeate throughout much of the song to accentuate the dull grooves, particularly during the chorus. The song\u2019s a real fucking toe-tapper when the intro melody comes out swinging during the chorus, after the solo and right before the song ends. Although it\u2019s easy to attribute this to old mate Jesper\u2019s guitar theatrics, it\u2019d be a little inaccurate since Daniel Svensson\u2019s lively drumming. Granted, he is largely keeping in time with the riffs and leads, but there\u2019s some pep in his step and energy in his arms \u2013 the sort that, well, peps up some sweet leads and uninspired chugging. The vocals, well... you won\u2019t get any argument from me in saying that his vocals are the sore spot in this album. Just this screamy caterwauling that sounds more annoying than anything else. But it\u2019s one of those things where if you got a singer like Jeff Scott Soto or something and put a little more work into the riffs, you\u2019d have an absolute banger of a song.\n\nSongs like \u201cOrdinary Story\u201d and \u201cColony\u201d have similar qualities to them that make them enjoyable listens despite their deficiencies. The former has a similarly lively vibe going on, albeit with its verses having those clean guitars and Anders doing this lame off-key Lou Reed/Robert Smith impersonation. Meanwhile, the latter tries for a slightly more spacey thing with its verses, mainly through virtue of the Hammond organ. Towards the end, \u201cInsipid 2000\u201d pops up and, after a bunch of filler (more on that later), here\u2019s this song that has this subtle lead that finds itself becoming a real earworm alongside the chugs, and between a couple of neat bass segments and a totally harmonic solo, the song picks things right back up. Once again, if not for the vocals and riffs, these would actually be quite good songs.\n\nFrankly, if every song on Colony was like this, I mean sure, there would still be some issues; but beyond that, it\u2019d be a fairly good album with all things considered. They understood what they have at their disposal and play to their strengths here. They knew Jesper and Bjorn can pull off some nice harmonic leads to grab your attention. They knew those harmonics and Jesper\u2019s leads played atop Bjorn\u2019s chugs could lead to some common cold catchy tracks. They knew Anders... was Anders, BUT REGARDLESS, they knew what they were doing, and they did it well.\n\nThe problem is, not every song is like this. Not even close. Introduce the listener with a cool lead or busy dual-guitar lead, then lifelessly chug on through. Maybe bring back the intro for the chorus \u2013 which, unlike in \u201cEmbody the Invisible\u201d and \u201cOrdinary Story\u201d, weren\u2019t exactly purposed for a chorus and thus, it just sounds like they had no idea what to really do for the chorus. Maybe throw out a decent solo \u2013 or, in the case of \u201cCoerced Existence\u201d, have a guest (in this case, Kee Marcello) Malmsteen their way through the solo, if only briefly \u2013 before repeating the chorus. Then... well, that\u2019s another song in the bag \u2013 next one.\n\nThere\u2019s a nice and good EP somewhere in Colony \u2013 mostly in the beginning \u2013 and I definitely recommend doing what you probably would\u2019ve been doing anyway when you listen to this album and stick with \u201cEmbody the Invisible\u201d, \u201cOrdinary Story\u201d, \u201cColony\u201d and \u201cInsipid 2000\u201d. Despite all that, Colony is still a solid album and absolutely the last worthwhile In Flames album.\n",
        "\nJesper Stromblad is one talented bastard. He wrote the music, played guitar, played drums, and helped to pioneer a genre on this first album of In Flames. Chronologically, this full-length is only one behind the first entry in what many consider to be In Flames' untouchable trio of albums (plus one, if you count Clayman), but it is still quite a different In Flames than the one that presents itself on The Jester Race. \n\nPerhaps most noticably, the guitar parts aren't as layered and wouldn't need four guitarists to reproduce live. It's mostly simple harmonized dual leads, obviously influenced by Iron Maiden and quite good too. Not trying to be as ambitous and \"epic\" as they would do later on Jester Race really helped In Flames here, as a lot of these songs are much more memorable than the ones on that album. Most of them are mid-tempo groove numbers (like the title track) that contain the music of death metal in vocals only, but sometimes the speed and aggression of death metal worms its way in a little bit, like on \"Behind Space\" (killer opener) and \"Upon an Oaken Throne\". And of course, there's the signature In Flames acoustic parts, sounding more folk-like than they would on later albums. There's even a violin that shows up a few times - a page taken from At The Gates' book, probably. You can also hear the bass and it doesn't follow the guitars all the time, providing a steady chord progression instead. Bonus. Sticks in your head? Check. Sounds original? Check. Good? Check. \n\nThere's a couple mildly annoying things about this album, and the first is the placement of the soft interludes. They just don't flow well with the rest of the album. On its own, \"Everlost pt. 2\" is nice, with its acoustic guitars and beautiful female voice (very thick Swedish accent). On its own, \"Hargalaten\" is nice, containing a pretty good violin part and guitar harmonies. But they don't make sense with the rest of the album's style - perhaps if In Flames had made more of an effort to regularly integrate the violin and such into the rest of the album's music, it would work, but they didn't and the interludes feel like worthless filler. After the interludes, the second annoying thing about the album is the vocals. They're a bit too high and screechy for my taste... at least this vocalist isn't taking massive breaths into the microphone between lines like Anders Friden would do in the band's later years, when he switched to high screeches. \n\nThat disregarded, though, there's some pretty good stuff here. One of In Flames' best, if not the best. It's not wildly original or inventive, but it's well-written for the most part and a good choice if you want to take a break from more extreme music and listen to some stuff with lots of melody.\n",
        "\nRarely does a band re-recording their older studio material go well. There are instances where it makes sense of course; wanting to give older material the benefit of new production, wanting to re-interpret the material within the framework of a different style, wanting to show off a new vocalist who was substantially different to the one who performed on the old material, and so on - all of these cases would produce re-recordings that have a purpose by serving a need the original could not provide, even if it turns out ultimately redundant and inferior to the original. This however has no reason to exist at all, being a note-for-note rehash of Clayman's title track that adds nothing whatsoever to the original song. Every change made here is one for the worse, and what few positives this track does have is carried over from the original and has nothing to do with this version specifically.\n\nThe production, which on Clayman was and continues to be a gold standard for modern metal, is not copied or improved upon here. The thunderous sound of the drums, the slick and heavy guitars, the vocal layering, precisely none of that is present. Instead, the band chooses to use a remarkably weak and pacified production style, as if it was a practice session for a bar band. Sure it's still slick and what not but it sounds so much limper than the old song, lacking a lot of the low end, volume and punch the music had and robbing the music of a lot of its original power. The instrumentation sounds lifeless and lacks weight and frankly even by the standards of an average modern metal recording, let alone the original song, this completely fails to cut the mustard.\n\nThe instrumentation is performed 100% faithfully - while many would see this as a good thing I believe it serves only to make this recording more redundant than it otherwise would have been. Later In Flames traded its layered guitar harmonies for increased keyboard presence, but the band doesn't even choose to adapt the song into their more modern formula - while this wouldn't have made it better it'd at least give it somewhat more of a reason to exist, instead of being a facsimile that pales in every conceivable way to the original. And then there are the vocals; Anders Frid\u00e9n has generally never been a particularly good vocalist, harsh or clean, but at least backed up with the massive production of Clayman and with some vocal layering, his growls and cleans fit with the instrumentation well and weren't the focus of the song. Here, with its anaemic recording and unsuitable vocal mixing, all of his vocals are pushed to the forefront and as you would expect he doesn't sound good at all. His growls sound weak and his cleans are as awkward and whimpering as ever, with his performance here really topping off how useless this entire endeavour is.\n\nThere are many failed re-recordings in metal - Let There Be Blood springs immediately to mind - but at least on that album Exodus wanted to give the original album heavier, modern production and show off a new vocalist that, while in the same lane as the the original, could still offer something different. As bad as that album is, at least it makes sense as to why Exodus chose to record it, and while I didn't care for the changes made on that album, that can be put down to personal taste. This on the other hand is inconceivably worthless and devoid of any distinguishing positive characteristics - every change made on this version is objectively inferior to what was on the original, and the band do nothing to substantially change it in a way that could be seen as some sort of reinterpretation of the original. As bad as this band's post-Clayman output is, they're still better off sticking to what they've been doing for nearly 2 decades instead of pointlessly rehashing the past. \n\nAt least this should put to rest the delusion that this band will ever turn it around, because with all the lineup changes from their glory days it will never happen, as demonstrated here.\n",
        "\nI love In Flames. I love their works through the old and the new, for the most part, anyways. Even today, they are capable of writing some excellent pieces. I'm willing to defend nearly everything they've done, save for a few utterly fucked works. But hey, harkening back to an album like Clayman is something that probably 80% of fans wanted, myself included! Unfortunately, something got completely lost in translation.\n\nI'm not against the idea of re-recording old songs. I'm still excited for the 20th Anniversary album's additions! The one positive that everyone can agree upon is that while there are re-recordings, the fidelity of the original songs remain completely unchanged as long as we can still listen to the original versions, which we'll always have access to. Hell, the 20th Anniversary album is going to have all of the songs but remastered. Thankfully, they won't be remastered by Howard Benson and Chris Lord-Alge. That's probably the best thing that can happen for this album.\n\nTo start off with the positives, it's certainly a 'fresh take' on the title track. Granted, it's completely inferior to the original in every way. Secondly, despite what people might say, the vocals are perfectly fine. Are they as good as they were in the original? Nope, but they're still the highlight of the track. They're the only thing keeping the mix from feeling completely hollow. It's also the one consistent element in the mix when listening on different forms of media. Why so many people keep citing the vocals as the biggest problem with the re-recording is beyond me. Everything else is so much worse.\n\nThe bass is serviceable. It doesn't even come close to Peter Iwers' playing, but it's not bad. With that being said, there's nothing to say about it. It's barely there, but it isn't bad. The sad thing is that this is one of the better parts of the re-recording.\n\nThe synth isn't entirely boring, it's certainly more lively than the synths Amaranthe's been using for the past couple years, but that's not saying much. It's incredibly modern-sounding, and that just isn't my thing. At the very least, it is a nitpick. There are much worse things to tear apart here.\n\nThe guitars, outside of the solo, are thin and flat. The playing isn't bad, the sound itself is okay. The tone doesn't quite approximate the original perfectly, but it doesn't do a bad job (Aside from the rhythm guitar, that one sounds like shit all the time)... At least when listening to it on my phone. On my laptop and headphones, the tone of one of the two leads sounds fucking atrocious, while the other lead actually sounds great. It's absolutely baffling. The solo also works, particularly because the guitar here is mixed well and is front and center. Wow, what a concept. If only the rest of the song thought about that. In fact, I don't entirely think it's the band that's the main problem here.\n\nThe drums sound like shit. There's honestly no defending them. Sure, you could argue that the modern-sounding guitars are a stylistic choice that not everybody likes. The same thing can't be said about the drums. There is no punch to them, the kit just sounds awful. The cymbals are okay, at least when I listened to this on my laptop and headphones, though they were non-existent when I listened to them on my phone's speaker. The faster parts of the drumming are emphasized more in the re-recording than they were in the original, particularly in the chorus, and it throws the beat completely off-balance. The playing is also a bit more technical, but that sort of redundant, wanky kind of technical. I'm not really one for it, as the drumming makes the song seem entirely different in terms of the beat and pacing, even though it really isn't.\n\nI think if the one lead's tone was fixed and if they got a better, punchier kit, that would fix the band's side of the problem. If that was it, I could easily say the re-recording's okay and be done with the review here. Unfortunately, it's so much worse than that.\n\nThe production and the mix utterly ruin the song. Benson and Lord-Alge slaughter pretty much everything aside from the vocals- Worse than in Battles or I, the Mask. At least the mixes there feel full. Yes, Benson is notorious for destroying any credibility In Flames could have with their choruses by making them completely vocal-centric and awkwardly melodic in the production and mixing department, but the instruments are pushed back to the point where they feel stock. In Flames should not sound like royalty-free music, which is what this would be if it was an instrumental track, save for the one lead that actually sounds fantastic. Even then, why would you listen to the original, which was ahead of its time in making the mix feel filled to the brim without overdoing it and say \"Yeah, let's push everything back so that the vocals are at the forefront\"? It's a ridiculous poppy/modern ideology that does not work for In Flames, and particularly this re-recording. The only song I could see it working for (Out of the four that have re-recordings) is \"Only For the Weak\", and that's pushing it. Benson and Lord-Alge aren't suited for melodeath, and they do not understand this music the way that Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m and Roberto Laghi do. Hell, even Daniel Bergstrand understood their sound better. With new In Flames music, it's passable because they write more of alternative metal/metalcore these days, but Benson's approach is horrible with melodic death metal, and it makes me so thankful that Ted Jensen is remastering the original tracks instead of Benson and Lord-Alge. His discography is respectable, but still quite mainstream, so I am a bit nervous, though the mastering of many of his works is pretty good (At least to me, anyways).\n\nThis isn't quite a matter of \"Oh, the engineers are horrible\", but rather that they don't understand this style of music, and that buried the track. I'm all for defending In Flames, and if the one lead and the kit were fixed, they would've done a damn fine job, but the production and mixing kills any sort of energy this track could've ever carried. That being said, the one lead and the kit are pretty lifeless anyways, and even if Nordstr\u00f6m himself had returned, the re-recording couldn't be quite saved. This isn't entirely horrible, it's different. Unfortunately, that different is completely inferior to the original, but at least I can listen to this ten or so times for every couple hundred times I listen to the original. I have a feeling that the re-recording of \"Pinball Map\" is doomed, but maybe \"Bullet Ride\" or \"Only For the Weak\" will be salvageable. One can only hope.\n\nHave I been overly harsh on this? Yeah, certainly, but it's because I know they're capable of so much better. \"I Am Above\", as a lead single to I, the Mask, felt fresh, and it showed that they can still churn out good music. Hell, nearly every track of I, the Mask did that. It's a bit ironic that the newer music sounds better than this, and that what everybody wanted turned out to be pretty mediocre. This should've been an easy home run, and they botched it. We'll have to see if Clayman 2020, as an album, will print money like it damn well should, but I have my doubts.\n\nOne comment on the lyric video (Which is pretty good, but is irrelevant to this review) said that \"[It] sounds like someone squeezed a classic master piece through some free filters in garage band.\", and that's a pretty accurate way of looking at it. Take away the vocals, and it's a royalty-free song. In Flames is capable of better than that. To sink so low shouldn't be possible for them, and here we are. Let's hope the other re-recordings and the remastered version of the eleven standard tracks are better than this. And hey, at least we can still listen to the original track and the original album. That alone is worth the price of admission.\n",
        "\nFor about as long as melodic death metal has been a concept, there has always been a desire to pigeon-hole it by the older death metal guard who saw the very idea as an affront to what the sub-genre has always been about, i.e. something not amenable to the musical mainstream. Often times this came along with the assertion that the style began and ended with a certain collection of albums by one third of the Gothenburg trio, namely In Flames, who arguably were the closest to an older heavy metal sound than the other two key pioneers of the Swedish melodeath sound. There may have been something to the assertion that said band were flirtatious with the millennial power metal revival by the time their 5th studio album Clayman hit the shelves, given said album's producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m having fairly obvious ties to said movement both via his engineering work and his band Dream Evil. Nevertheless, the assertion that In Flames' sound embodied every negative connotation surrounding their adopted style was a tenuous one, though the subsequent abandonment of their original sound following the aforementioned album brought increasing validity to the charge.\n\nTo state that the synthesizer-drenched, quasi-metalcore style that this band adopted following 2001 is a move towards boldfaced commercialism would be an understatement. Nevertheless, the bulk of this band's old school fans have been agitating for a return to the good old days ever since, to the point of sheer delusion when considering that the majority of the musicians that were responsible for making their golden era a reality had long abandoned ship. In light of this, the re-recording of their masterwork of a title track off their fifth album (their final one in the eyes of many) was a doomed prospect from the start, and functions as a sort of rude awakening for those still clinging to the hope that Anders Friden and Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte could instantaneously turn the clock back about two decades. It's the same basic game of notes, possessed of the same masterful songwriting (which puts it a rung above just about every song they've composed since), but it's more of a shell of the original rather than a worthy tribute to it. Anders' vocals sound more hoarse and thin than they do forbidding, the guitars lack any real sense of impact, the drums have little in the way of punch, and the glaring synthesizer backdrop essentially renders this a step away from being a Soundtrack To Your Escape b-side.\n\nTo sum up things in a somewhat abstract way, this band just doesn't have it anymore; it being the thing that separates a classic slab of melodeath brilliance from a lighter groove/metalcore radio rocker. In the interest of fairness, this song does retain some semblance of its original glory in that the parts included are performed adequately, save the vocals. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to discover that a plurality of In Flames' current fan base will see this as an improvement upon the original, as it does just about everything to conform itself to the still popular melodic groove sound that has since been adopted by the likes of The Unguided and Solution .45, among several others since the mid-2000s. It's not the same song, because ultimately it just isn't the same band anymore, and the sooner that the masses of older melodeath fans get that processed, the better they will be for it. Frankly speaking, the remnant of In Flames would do well to get back to what they've been doing of the past decade, because this just doesn't work.\n",
        "\nWhen you think of In Flames, you think of guitar harmonies. When you think of Clayman, you think of the massive production with a thick and heavy guitar sound that practically set the standard for modern metal production. The guitar sound on the original recording is so monumental that you'll still hear recording enthusiasts referring to \"Fredman mic-ing\" or how Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m relayed some techniques to a forum poster a few years after the album came out. \n\nThen there's new In Flames - everything after Clayman - where the guitar work was simplified, the band inexplicably began cloaking entire albums in synths despite not even having a band member to play them, and Anders Friden's vocals began to take a larger part in the band. Historical revision which denies the band's existence after Clayman has become popular, as has the quest for a time machine to bring back this band which was tragically abducted by aliens shortly before they were scheduled to record a live album in Japan and a follow-up to Clayman. \n\nWhen we hear about a new In Flames album, there is this inexplicably burning eternal flame of hope in the hearts of fans of old In Flames that it might not sound like post-2000 In Flames. There's a lust for layers of guitar melodies and the massive guitar sounds of Clayman and The Jester Race. What nobody wants is music saturated in keyboards with Anders Friden's singing at the forefront. To quote Anders, just last year: \n\n\"No. I will never go back and do another 'The Jester Race' or 'Whoracle' or 'Colony' or 'Clayman'. It wouldn't be right. It wouldn't be true to that album. That album is perfect in every way. If I try to go back 20 years and try to recreate something when I'm in a whole different state of mind, that wouldn't do it justice. It would just only be bad.\"\n\n...and that's exactly what this is. Just only bad. \n\nFounding guitarist Jesper Stromblad - the last remaining original member, who left the band some years ago, has said that the band just wasn't the same, that they should change their name, and he's happy to have left that sinking ship. He said the band was a guitar riff band, and it's not anymore. That's exactly right. This band can't do this song justice. \n\nThe weakest link is, of course, Anders Friden's singing. He's distinct, which worked out well when the band build massive guitar harmonies behind him, but he's not a very good singer, and that really comes out when he's at the forefront. His growls were distinct and fit perfectly on The Jester Race. His half-shriek/half-sung vocals on Clayman worked with the sound of everything else on the original. When you take that away and re-record a song with awful production that could now be done in the average bedroom, it's just only bad. \n\nAs the man himself said it would be last year, this is just only bad.\n",
        "\nI confess I did not see this coming. My relationship with In Flames began with \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\" as I was in high school, and is still alive to that day. But, and now come the words of a sinner, I have somehow painfully ignored the glorious melodic death metal era of In Flames. I know every album by heart from \"Reroute to Remain\", over the aforementioned \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\" to \"I, the Mask\". Every single album is a piece of art for me. Yes, I have said it, now the traditionalists will roll their eyes and sharpen their blades. The fact that it seems to be a factor of coolness to bash In Flames because they refuse to stick to traditional rules of the metal scene is beyond me, but that is another story and did not belong here.\n\nAh, fuck it... Just a few little words for every elitist out there who thinks that everything that is not Iron Maiden, Cannibal Corpse, or whatever must be shit: Be open-minded and enjoy the music, mate. I am a metalhead myself since my ninth birthday and I promise you \"metal\" is just a word. I walked the same misleading road of ignorance for years, and it just wasted my time denying great bands that not played their music in a way the metal community used to love. Even the glorious Metal-Archives are thrown into elitism in some ways, and I did not understand some choices the moderators do in terms of accepting a band as metal or not. I can see the reason behind it but I cannot understand every selection. And nonetheless I love this site! So please do the same, just call it \"music\", and you will get more open for new things. Do not let good music slip through your fingers just because it does not fit anything you idolize. It will open new ways for you, and you will be very happy with it. You are not forced to like everything, but try to respect it in some ways.\n\nEnough said, let's enter \"Lunar Strain\". I've stumbled across \"Lunar Strain\" again a few days ago as the In Flames-push has come back to me again, that happens every now and then, and I dived through the aforementioned albums. Somehow I took a listen of \"Lunar Strain\", and badaboom, it captured me. The opening riff of the opener \"Behind Space\" took me by storm and I ran through the whole album. It seemed that I have never realised how gloomy \"Lunar Strain\" sounds before, it has a kind of magic that just unfolds now before me. One reason for this is the production that appeared more raw than on later albums, I think that especially the more hollow un-polished sound gave many albums of that style an more magical feeling to it. \n\nEven when the songwriting is not that professional than on later album it stand straight before me because for a a debut album the songwriting is very consistent. On one hand we have Jesper Str\u00f6mblad's guitar work that is ultra melodical and sweats his vision out of every pore. I can say without a doubt that he is one of the greatest guitarists of all time because what he creates on \"Lunar Strain\" is a class of its own even when it is just a small sign of things to come. On the other hand we have the bass which is audible but not that spectacular, the same goes for the drumming on \"Lunar Strain\". It is not overly technical nor spectacular but it works very well nonetheless because it gave the guitars the needed room to breathe and unfold. To speak for myself I think that even a shy drumming can be great if it serves the song, nothing must be technical for the sake of being technical. So \"Lunar Strain\" can be counted as a good example of effective drumming that serves the song and its gloomy, mellow atmosphere.\n\nThere is one point on \"Lunar Strain\" that grabs me the most, the vocalist. We do not speak of some guy who makes a one-album-appearence and disappears into oblivion. We speak about Mikael Stanne! Yeah I know, in the case of In Flames he really does just a one-album-appearence, but he never left the business. He is one of the key members that shaped a whole genre with his own band, the mighty Dark Tranquillity, alongside At the Gates and our beloved In Flames. Although his later work pleases me more he does a more than great job on \"Lunar Strain\". His charactaristic voice gives me chills every time I hear \"Lunar Strain\", he growls, shrieks, and screams as when there is no tomorrow. Although I love Anders Frid\u00e9n I cannot imagine how \"Lunar Strain\" would sound without Mikael Stanne behind the microphone.\n\nSo what left to say? \"Lunar Strain\" may not be a over-the-top album in particular but it is one of the great mothers that gave birth to a genre that is alive up to that day. I praise it, and I recommend it to everyone who has a love for melodic death metal with some folky influences, Iron Maiden worship, and a soul. It is just a small sign of the greatness that follows this album but for me \"Lunar Strain\" is a beautiful beginning for a band with one of the most interesting discographies out there. Thank you for yout time, my friend.\n",
        "\nOriginal Review: 14 March, 2020 (I've since posted an updated retrospective to elaborate on some things I meant previously and how my view has changed since first reviewing this. Do read that after this first look at the album.)\n\nAnybody who's listened to In Flames has heard of this album. It not only broke the band into the mainstream worldwide, particularly America, it also marked a radical shift in sound from melodic death metal to alternative metal/metalcore. That's all the introduction that this album needs.\n\nThe guitarwork no longer has different, yet harmonized leads. Bjorn plays the lead guitar, Jesper plays the rhythm guitar. It's a change that was made to make playing live on stage easier. While that's great, the harmonized leads were a great piece of In Flames' musicianship and sound, and that wouldn't be brought back as a key element until \"Come Clarity\". Even then, the second guitar acted as the rhythm guitar, making the whole thing essentially the same. The drumwork and bass on this album remain basically unchanged, and I'm happy with that.\n\nThe other big change in this album is the vocals. Anders' growls from \"The Jester Race\" to \"Clayman\" (In which it was wearing thin and transitioning to what we have here) have become higher screams. They sound good sometimes, but most of the time they're not great. It really depends on the sound. He wouldn't quite have incredible screams until \"Come Clarity\". His clean vocals are now a major part of many songs, and they're also pretty hit or miss. On songs like Free Fall and Metaphor, they sound nice and carry the melody competently. In other songs like the title track and Dawn of a New Day, they're monotone and dull. They drag the songs down.\n\nWorse yet, those two songs are quite boring anyway. Unfortunately, \"Reroute to Remain\" doesn't start off on a great foot. An opening track is the listener's first taste of an album, and the title track might just be In Flames' weakest opener yet. Dawn of a New Day is also slow, and it drags out. This would be fine if they did something to change things up a bit or to inject some life into it, but it's nearly four minutes of monotony.\n\nSongs like Transparent and Free Fall, meanwhile, are the best cuts from the album. The bass in Transparent is incredible, along with everything else. The riff in Transparent, while not exactly that technical, is still a joy to hear. Free Fall, meanwhile, should have been the album's third single. It's a shame that the song is pretty much forgotten even by fans because it's the best song on the album bar none.\n\nThe two singles we got are Trigger and Cloud Connected. Most people are split on these two, and it's easy to see why. Trigger is more traditional for In Flames in terms of sound, while Cloud Connected has a synth that, while nice sounding, is a bit too forward in the mix. In terms of structure, they're both quite similar, and the same can be said for the meaning of the lyrics. There really isn't too much to be said about either of them that hasn't been said by everyone else. To me, they're both two of the better songs from Reroute to Remain that are rightfully loved by many of In Flames' fans, though I completely understand why some people hate either one or both of them.\n\n\"Reroute to Remain\" has a strange, yet understandably mixed reputation for good reason. It's a welcome change that was executed... Decently. Some songs stack up to the rest of In Flames' discography while others are towards the bottom of the catalog. Unfortunately, the wonder of listening to the album's mostly worn off for me. Three years ago, I would've given this an 80%, but many of the tracks are simply middling in terms of quality compared to the rest of In Flames' works. Although I despise \"Battles\", that album's always a... Well, it's a trip to listen to. The album isn't bad, it's not even so average it's bad. It has some good tracks, it has some shit tracks, and the rest, while they sound pretty good in the moment, just come and go, even if they aren't quite filler. In Flames changed, and that's okay, but they just hadn't found their footing quite yet here. It wouldn't be until 2006's \"Come Clarity\" that they would find a level of cohesiveness that would be a home run- At least for me, anyway. At the time of its release, yeah, it would've been In Flames' weakest outing, but we've seen both better and worse come from them since then. I've given it some praises, I've given it some shit, but for reasons that I can't quite explain as well as I'd like, I have to rate it this low. I want to love this album more than I do, but it's something that's just the middle of the pack at best. There's diversity here, but the album's overall sound doesn't blow me away, save for a few songs. Although I've said quite a bit here, there isn't much to get across. It'll sound pretty good in the moment, but in the end, it'll just come and go.\n\nTracks To Recommend: Free Fall, Transparent, Cloud Connected, Metaphor (I didn't speak about this song much, but it's beautiful to me. You might disagree though, so it's better that you listen to it yourself instead of taking my word for it.)\nTracks To Avoid: Reroute to Remain, Dawn of a New Day, System (I have mixed feelings about the track.), Egonomic (Filler, but it's fast and short.)\n\nUpdated Retrospective: 16 March, 2022\n\nIt's been a while since I've taken a look at this album, and part of me wonders if there's any good reason to comb this album over again. However, I listened to Reroute from front to back just last night, and considering that my reviews in the past were a bit rough around the edges and that my ears are much keener now that I've looked into even more music and have even dabbled into working on some, I believe it's worth seeing how my view of the album has changed. I'll try to keep this brief, since I'm not going to delete anything from the original version and it's wordy enough as is.\n\nThe correct myself a bit on the drums and bass: Holy shit, the drums sounds fantastic here. They pack a significant punch (This might be one of the best sounding snares or kits overall that I've ever heard), and they do a ton for the album for me. Similarly, the bass is rather thick, and it's up a surprising amount in the mix. Mind you, it's more audible in some songs (Most notably Transparent) than others, but even in the songs where I don't hear it so much, it's still very much there, and I can appreciate that. I should also mention that I've come around quite a bit to Anders' clean vocals in most instances on this album, even if they're pretty terrible objectively.\n\nFunnily enough, I've come around a bit to some of the songs I didn't care for on my last visit. The title track is easily the weakest opener in all of In Flames' discography by a long shot, but I actually think it works really well in the context of this album and the rest of the songs. \"System\" is also a really wonderful, sort of curveball song like \"Dead Alone\" from the subsequent album. Unlike \"Dead Alone\", \"System\" doesn't change up the actual structure so much as it goes in a completely different direction and pacing in every part of the song. While that's something that's rather easy to fuck up, I think they actually pull it off well here. \"Dawn of a New Day\" is a song that is a bit too repetitive, but I actually like it a lot more than I used to. I just think it's too long for its own good- Particularly with the final chorus.\n\nThat being said, certain songs are rather weak. I have no idea how I neglected to mention \"Black and White\" last time, as it's not only the weakest song of Reroute, it's probably In Flames' weakest closing track. This track doesn't come together in the least in any way, even if I get what they were going for. Unfortunately, interesting intentions can't carry a song if the execution isn't interesting in the least. I've listened to this album six times overall- Three or four times back in high school, and two or three since then, and this song has never done a goddamn thing for me. Seriously, I ended up forgetting about it when I first wrote this review. That's kinda fucked up. Anyways, I think it's the vocals and lyrics in \"Egonomic\" that bring it down. The music is actually some classic In Flames goodness that is rather fast and energetic, but... The chorus simply doesn't carry the intensity, even if the pace is there. I also used to think that \"Drifter\" was some underrated gem back in high school, but... No, not even close. The guitarwork especially is boring as fuck.\n\nIn fact, that brings me to my biggest problem with this album: So many songs are in desperate need of better guitarwork (Particularly in the verses). I hate to concede this, since In Flames is still my favorite band of all, but I'd argue that leading up to this point, over half of their songs didn't have real riffs, they simply had incredible lead melodies courtesy of Jesper. But honestly, I'd argue that those incredible leads not only sufficed, but made In Flames a bit of a different beast compared to Dark Tranquillity and At the Gates in those early years. They truly followed that mantra of mixing the melodies of Iron Maiden with the brutality of death metal. In addition to that, the rhythm sections were still great. Reroute to Remain occasionally has some fantastic leads or incredibly heavy riffs, but those are scarce and are usually relegated to non-verse sections. What do we have in their place? Chugging, and lots of it. Mind you, I'm not opposed to chugging if it's done well and has some nice leads on top of it. I think that would've done a ton for this album. Either that, or just have better riffs. It's absolutely baffling to me because some songs don't have this issue, and most songs at least have some nice lead melodies in the choruses. I also need to mention that some songs have some solos/breakdowns (Ex. \"Dismiss the Cynics\") that don't last nearly long enough, particularly clean guitar melodies. They sound really good, but they never go on for long enough to make any sort of impact, and so many songs just don't stick with me. There's good reason that so many songs here just don't end up being quite as popular or iconic within the fanbase. Every time I listen to the album, I generally think \"Wow, I love the majority of these songs, these are all fucking awesome\", but not even two days later, I struggle to remember any aside from the four I recommended (And \"Trigger\"). They need something to elevate them, as I think there are some quality songs here.\n\nBut I think that's what brings me to this album's greatest strength. With most albums, the magic sort of wears off after the third or fourth listen. It's still great stuff, but I tend to just stick with my favorite songs. While I tend to just stick with my favorite songs here, every listen to Reroute to Remain retains that magic of the first listen because, frankly speaking, a ton of the songs are sleeper hits that I get really into on each listen. Hell, part of me wants to recommend those songs instead since they never quite get their due. I'd love to talk about the rest of the songs I rather enjoyed, but I'd rather not end up doing a track by track review. I think I'm already toeing the line there, and I'm not even sure that doing an update'll go through here or not. The middle stretch of the album in particular is a wonderful listening experience for me. \n\nThat being said, I feel like this album is a hard sell. I don't blame old fans both back in 2002 or during 2022 for feeling burned by this, even if I'd argue that Clayman was the transition to Reroute, not Reroute being the transition to everything else. Fans of the modern stuff (Not just the new stuff/stuff since Clayman) are probably going to be turned off by the vocals and lack of leads/riffs. It's the same with the alt metal crowd. Hell, I feel like the guitarwork is a bit too shallow at points for fans of old metalcore, but the vocals just won't grab any modern metalcore fans. I'm genuinely surprised that this album was really successful, and I can only attribute that to two things. 1. Nu metal was on its way out, metalcore was on its way in (At least in terms of mainstream popularity). I think this was just metal enough for metal fans at the time, yet also interesting enough for metalcore fans at the time. Whether the timing of this, STYE, and Come Clarity was simply luck or a stroke of genius, I'll never know. 2. There's something rather accessible about this album. I wouldn't say anything past \"Trigger\", \"Cloud Connected\", \"Free Fall\", and \"Metaphor\" are quite radio-friendly though. All of the album's songs are surprisingly catchy in the moment, but the singles especially. I don't think they have much staying power, but they're at least accessible and catchy, which I don't think is a bad thing. In Flames' music has always been like that, even back with The Jester Race and Subterranean. However, I think they absolutely perfected that with Colony and Clayman. Regardless, while I still feel like this is a rather middling album and one that I wouldn't change my rating on, it's one I'd still recommend. Nine times out of ten I wouldn't recommend it as someone's first In Flames album, but I still do recommend it at some point.\n\nWell, so much for trying to be concise here. That didn't really go so well. I can only hope that the update for this review will be accepted, as I think it's really important to have my elaborated thoughts for anyone who may stumble upon this review while they ponder whether to listen to this album of not.\n\nAlso, let's please retroactively make the avoid list be \"Drifter\", \"Egonomic\", and \"Black and White\". Maybe \"System\" for its lack of approachability and \"Dawn of a New Day\" for still being a bit long and repetitive, but I enjoy those songs enough to leave them off the list.\n",
        "\nFor the sake of context I\u2019m just going to come out and say it. In Flames is my favorite metal band of all time. I absolutely adore classics such as The Jester Race and Whoracle that set the bar for what melodic death metal could be. Unfortunately in 2002, In Flames switched to a more modern alternative metal sound in order to pursue commercial success, alienating a large portion of their old fans in the process. Despite this, I still greatly enjoyed all of the band\u2019s material up until Siren Charms, which was boring and sounded nothing like the band. To make matters worse, the album\u2019s follow up, Battles, made it clear that In Flames had no intention of righting the wrongs of their previous album. Because of this, I didn\u2019t really have any expectations for I, the Mask. I was expecting it to be Battles 2.0 and, as a result, I set my expectations pretty low going in. \n\nWith that being said, I, the Mask isn\u2019t quite as bad as I initially expected, but it is still pretty weak. The main issue here is that the album sounds more like two EPs that were spliced together rather than a cohesive work. The reason I say this is because about half of this album sounds like b-sides from A Sense of Purpose and the other side quite literally is Battles 2.0. Obviously, the latter isn\u2019t too great, but the former manages to be interesting for at least a listen or two. For example, the title track on this album is fast and energetic and ends up being the most In Flames have sounded like In Flames in years. I say this because of the melodic guitar lead at the beginning of the track along with the folky riff that repeats several times during the chorus. Aside from that, the song has a fast tempo and riffs that utilize the string-skipping that is popular in the melodic death metal genre. Other stand out tracks include \u201cCall My Name\u201d, \u201cI Am Above\u201d, and \u201cBurn\u201d which all contain solid riffing and catchy choruses that are bound to get stuck in the listeners head. \n\nUnfortunately, these standout tracks are about the only thing worth praising on I, the Mask. The rest of the album ranges from stale to downright awful. Songs like \u201cStay With Me\u201d and \u201cAll the Pain\u201d sound exactly like the alt-rock garbage that the band played on the preceding album. Aside from those two tracks, \u201c(This Is Our) House'' is quite possibly the worst song In Flames have ever written. The riffs are beyond stale and the verses and chorus are god awful. Most of the other songs on the album don\u2019t fare much better. While it is obvious that the band attempted to adopt a more metallic approach on a lot of these songs when it comes to the riffs, the vocals and overall song structuring are extremely commercial sounding and not in a good way. Anders apparently worked pretty hard before the album was recorded to improve his singing, but as a result about 90% of the album utilizes cleans. While this is not inherently a bad thing, when paired with the alt-rock song structuring and flat production, the album just ends up sounding excessively commercial. It lacks the energy of the band's previous output and just feels forced and stale.\n\nIn the end, I, the Mask is a strange album review because, while I don\u2019t particularly like the majority of the music here, the album is definitely a step in the right direction for In Flames. As I mentioned before, some of the songs on here aren\u2019t even half bad. In fact, a couple are pretty good, but overall I can\u2019t recommend I, the Mask because of how inconsistent it is. If you like A Sense of Purpose, I would recommend that you check out the songs I mentioned earlier as highlights for the album, but for everyone else I would steer clear.\n",
        "\nIt feels a bit odd looking back at albums like \"Siren Charms\" and \"Battles\" and thinking \"Huh, they're starting to get out of the hole they dug themselves.\", but for a while, it didn't seem like they would. Unfortunately, I don't think they'll ever change their style back to any of their former styles (Even \"Sounds of a Playground Fading\"), but they do harken back to them at times. They've gone from alternative metal to... Well, half alternative metal, half metalcore, but progress is progress. Some songs are fantastic, some songs are okay, and two are awful.\n\nAnders has been taking vocal lessons in between \"Battles\" and \"I, the Mask\", and it shows. Thankfully, the autotune is gone, and unlike \"Battles\", which needed that crutch, this album would've been crippled by the autotune. Anders can carry a melody on his own (Albeit, with a bit of harmonizing at times), and he put some effort into his harsh vocals. Songs like I Am Above, and Burn show that his harsh vocals aren't just subdued and worn down. Meanwhile, songs, like All the Pain, and Stay With Me show his clean vocals at their best. Unfortunately, the choruses seriously make or break the songs. Burn is completely decimated by its chorus, which is reminiscent (Putting it generously) of pop songs like Firework.\n\nThe guitarwork, while not living up to the standards of In Flames' old albums, absolutely stands amongst the post-Reroute albums. The riffs, hooks, and solos are more consistently better than they have been for years. There are some parts reminiscent of their previous albums, mostly being \"Come Clarity\", \"A Sense of Purpose\", and \"Sounds of a Playground Fading\", and I find it to add a couple of facets that keep the album from being stale at times. There are also some acoustic guitars, and I absolutely love them. They were beautiful on songs like Moonshield and Come Clarity over a decade ago (Over two in the former's case), and they're beautiful here. The drums have been given a bit of attention in the mix too, which is a step up from \"Battles\". As for the bass... I heard it once, and I'm not impressed at all. It's at the back of the mix again, but it doesn't even seem like it was plugged into the amp.\n\nThe lyrics are much better than \"Battles\" this time around too, and while I wouldn't say that they hold up compared to In Flames' pre-Clarity works, they are genuine, and they don't sound like they were written by a toddler. Again, progress is progress, though some songs are better than others. Some of them can feel particularly \"emo\", and feel like they could belong on \"A Sense of Purpose\". I'm personally not too attached to those songs lyrically, but they don't do anything egregious or offensive.\n\nStay With Me is a magnificent song, especially for the closer, though it is a bit repetitive. They should've added another verse because the amount of times the chorus is repeated doesn't line up with how much they've done musically. Meanwhile, songs like (This Is Our) House and In This Life are downright awful. The former is probably the worst thing that In Flames has ever done, as it is incohesive, and it has another fucking children's choir. I thought the backlash from \"Battles\" would've stopped them from pulling this shit again, but it seems that such is not the case. I know it has a good message about taking care of the Earth and all, but would you ever get that from the awful, vague lyrics? It's not some sort of deep, clever metaphor, it's just another song that on the surface just says to rise against the big bad evil guys. The latter song, meanwhile, is the definition of filler. It's slow, boring, and it's not that good. It has a decent solo, and the key shift is incredibly refreshing, but those are the only positives I have to say for the song. Frankly, I'm not sure which one is worse.\n\nThis album feels a bit more ambitious than \"Battles\", much more polished than \"Siren Charms\", more energetic than \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\", and its musical merits are enough to bring over people who may have been on the fence. Make no mistake, In Flames' detractors won't change their minds here. It's still very commercial and mainstream, though it feels like they knew how to do that without sacrificing their identity. All parties involved did at least try here, and I think that they did make a good album. I personally prefer most of their other works, but \"I, the Mask\" shows that they remember who they are. They'll never go back to their sound from \"The Jester Race\" or \"Whoracle\", and while that absolutely is a pipe dream, they are still capable of making good music. If you dissect the music, there is some real musicianship still here, and there is something to like. It's just much more accessible and mainstream than previously. That'll never change, and that's unfortunate, but it doesn't mean that they should be instantly written off completely. I know I didn't point out much of this album's flaws, and that's because aside from a couple, they're either so small that you should listen for yourself to pick them up, or they're just part of the subgenre that they're playing, making them a matter of preference. If you really want to make your mind up about the album, you should listen to it for yourself.\n\nTracks To Recommend: Voices, I Am Above, Stay With Me.\nTracks To Avoid: (This Is Our) House, In This Life, Not Alone (It's a decent song, but it's a tad boring, and Stay With Me is an infinitely better closer anyways).\n",
        "\nBands change. Whether to fit the shape of the industry, to fit the change in tastes of the band members or some other reason, bands shift sounds throughout their careers. Change itself is not inherently good or bad -- alienating an established fanbase is also not an indicator of poor quality either.\n\nThe above paragraph exists to dispel the strange strawman many positive reviews of this album seem to attack: the image of an old fan, clinging to In Flames' pre-Whoracle albums. This is the first In Flames album I've listened to in full, and I'll be judging it on its own merits. \n\nThere's not much merit to I, the Mask. This album suffers from problems threefold: the rock elements are uninspired and downright plagiaristic, the metal elements tired and trite, and the aesthetic of the album juvenile. There is one creative risk In Flames take here; unfortunately, it manifests itself as \"(This Is Our) House\" and \"Burn\", two of the worst tracks in the album.\n\nThe opening track, \"Voices\", is an apt representation of the \"metal\" side of this album. It has a good introduction that rides a derivative but fun lead guitar line. Unfortunately, the moment the song starts, all quality is quashed. The lead guitar is replaced by generic chugging backing Anders's one-note screams, occasionally chugging in electronic effects before a chorus as a pale imitation of a proper pre-chorus. After generic sing-along choruses backed by electronic glitch effects, rinse, repeat, generic solo, song out. \n\nThe rock elements manifest themselves as Rise Against-lite styled punk rock with occasional cleans. The songwriting formula follows that band's to a T: verse with the occasional harsh vocals - clean emotive chorus - repeat, solo, end. Riffs are not the main ingredient here, but that's okay - rock is vocals driven. Unfortunately, Anders pales in comparisons to vocalists like Tim McIlrath or Adam Gontier, his voice stock and uninteresting, without a personal touch or roughness that better punk rock bands have. At the very least, there doesn't seem to be any prominent AutoTune present on this album.\n\nThe stylistic experimentation ties into the failed aesthetic of the album -- Angelfire sites for 13-year-old \"goths\" who love nothing more than Evanescence. To that end, In Flames touches on pop and children's choirs. The pop comes in the form of \"Burn\"'s chorus, a baffling plagiarism of Katy Perry's \"Firework\". It's blatant, baffling and plain bad. The children's choir is used in \"(This Is Our) House\" to absolutely horrifying effect. The lyrics on said song are the worst in the album, filled with cliches such as \"one for all\", \"scream out loud\", \"won't back down\", and a myriad of teenage angst cliches. The children's choir forces the lyrics into the spotlight, making them impossible to ignore, even for the most lyrically ambivalent of listeners. While \"(This Is Our) House\" is the worst offender, the entire album's lyrics are mired in early-2000s cliche and angst. Overall, the album seems to be pandering to a non-existent audience that has long since outgrown this type of music. Everything from the laughable \"Jester\" that adorns the album cover, the embarrassing font that the album title is in, to the dated music and lyrics that scream \"we want to pander to 13-year-old goths\" reeks of failed commercialism. \n\nListening to I, the Mask is a thoroughly unpleasant experience. At best, it makes me squirm in my seat, wanting to listen to better rock; at worst, making me stare slack-jawed at my screen, assaulted by something that would have been viciously mocked even in 2005. I, the Mask is plagiaristic, repulsive, and depressing. I have not followed In Flames' trajectory as they fell, but the flaming aftermath of their fall is plain for anyone to see. Devoid of passion or enjoyment, this album is singularly without merit.\n",
        "\nI've heard a lot of people say that this album is a great return to form for In Flames, and that statement couldn't be farther from the truth. Granted, people have been giving it its due diligence in the last year or two, but I figured I'd join in on kicking the baby. \"Battles\" should've been another great album, as In Flames had really come to understand their craft, yet they forgot what made their music have any sort of identity in the past. Now, there are a lot of people who love to rip on In Flames. I'm not one of them. In fact, In Flames is my favorite band (Which is probably a depressing statement these days, and I've probably lost any credit I could've had by saying that), as they introduced me to melodic death metal and other heavier music. Their lyrics and musicianship are something that I usually love. I'm even willing to defend \"Sounds of a Playground Fading\", as I think it's a wonderful album. So to the one or two In Flames fans on this site: I'm not saying all of this because I hate the band, I'm saying this because they have proven themselves to be capable of so much better.\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room as soon as possible: Anders Frid\u00e9n's autotune. While this is something that is usually egregious (And it still kinda is), it's the album's one saving grace. Anders' clean vocals would likely sound downright lifeless without it, as starting with \"Siren Charms\", he had trouble carrying a melody. Meanwhile, Anders' screams just sound worn down, like he didn't try that hard this time around. Still, the vocals carry the album, as all other elements involved are decent at best and horrid at worst. It's usually the latter. The production here, well, it has one basic philosophy: Push the guitars forward, the drums get some attention, and fuck the bass. It's a mainstream alternative metal sort of mentality that I would normally just come to terms with, but I can't help but miss the production from albums like \"The Jester Race\", \"Sounds of a Playground Fading\", and even \"Subterranean\". Though the sad truth is, Howard Benson knew what the band wanted to sound like in this album, and he made it happen. It's not an album that was damned by its production, it's an album that was damned from the start.\n\nThe album has a few decent riffs, (Drained, Battles, Greatest Greed), though that's the highest praise I can give the guitarwork. The guitarwork in this album does little not only compared to many other bands, it does little compared to every other In Flames record. There isn't much to talk about, except the whiny high notes Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte likes to hit in this album, particularly during the solos. There is a lack of creativity here, and that's a shame. Dual guitar harmonies are mostly absent, most riffs are bland, the solos range from being alright (At least by this album's standards) to just plain sucking. Niclas Engelin doesn't even seem like he had a hand in writing anything, though I could be wrong. The drumwork is serviceable, but nothing special. Daniel Svensson's departure after \"Siren Charms\" leaves a void that just hasn't been filled here. I can't talk about the bass all too much. It's too far back in the mix to be worth a damn. When I can hear it, it sounds nice, but I think that was in one song at most. Peter Iwers is a great bassist, but his talents are wasted here.\n\nThere are two cardinal sins that this album commits: Horrible, grade school level lyrics, and having a children's choir. There are a few bands who can implement a children's choir (Or a choir that just sounds like one) well, but In Flames is not one of them, and they just need to stop this shit now. It sounds horrible, it rapes the tone, and it can sometimes break the pace where they try to have a moment of grandeur. The End, The Truth, and Here Until Forever (The latter of which being the only decent song of the three) suffer tremendously here, and if I'm leaving out any songs, I think that's just my mind trying to protect me. The lyrics are what I personally despise the most. They're silly, vague, and they aren't genuine. I know that I could say that the entire album, but the lyrics are the embodiment of that. \n\n\"The time has come to bring you down/\nTake the power back I'll show you how/\nI hear the sound of a plane passing by/\nSomeone had the same thoughts as I/\nBut as I get to the end of mine/\nYou deny and think everything is fine\"\n\nThat's the first verse of The Truth. It's laughable at best. I'm not sure how this passed, and it makes me miss the lyrical genius of songs such as Zombie Inc. and Take This Life. Drained, Here Until Forever, Wallflower, and Save Me are the only truly decent ones overall. Coincidentally, they're the only ones with any real emotion, and they do feel at least somewhat genuine. I could bring up other examples of atrocious lyrics in the album, but you already get the point. \n\nUsually, the album ranges from boring to sounding awful. There are some exceptions to this, being three of the four songs I mentioned in the previous paragraph. Wallflower, while nice and different, feels like they should've trimmed the fat from it. I can't say if I hate the more \"average\" boring tracks more or tracks like The Truth, which at least have some real melody and life to them- Not to say that they're genuine. It's a catch-22 that is only worse given the standard of this album.\n\nThis album, to put it bluntly, is simple. It's basic, and while that would be alright in some cases, the songs were just formulaic and didn't even try to take any risks\u2013 with the exception of Wallflower. I know \"Siren Charms\" gets a lot of shit, but this album skates on by using the previous album as a shield for backlash. \"Siren Charms\" did go in a couple of different directions at times, but was just half-baked, whereas \"Battles\" is basically something that even I could've come up with when I was back in middle school. Normally that'd be passable, but if you take a look at Moonshield, Only For The Weak, and even Come Clarity, this album is just disappointing. I'm not entirely satisfied with this review, admittedly. This album simultaneously deserves more and less contempt than what I've given it. It doesn't matter though, as I shelled out the money for this album. I think I'm the sucker in the end.\n\nTracks To Recommend: Drained, Here Until Forever, Save Me.\nTrack To Avoid: Pretty much half of the album, if not the majority of it. Particularly avoid The End and The Truth. They're the bottom of the barrel.\n\nI'm aware that 35% is actually bringing up the average score, and that just hurts to see. In Flames is capable of better than this, and that's what stings so much for me.\n",
        "\nMost everybody knows In Flames as a band of many phases. Most everybody knows as well that the fanbase of In Flames is one that is extremely divided over which phase is the best. Of course, there was the 90s phase - which was the period of somewhat vapid layered guitars and fantastical lyrics commonly labeled as \"melodic death metal\", and the one whose adherents cry \"sell-out\" at the more modern phase of alternative grooves and metalcore. The adherents of that more modern phase cry \"elitist\" and \"closed-minded\", with neither side ever seeming to prevail. Remaining rather numb to both parties, In Flames has continued down the road of sonic experimentation over the years, hitting several wrong turns along the way. This ninth album of theirs, \"A Sense of Purpose\", is one from a transitional period in their discography. Neither fully melodic death metal nor alternative grooves, it is the inconsistent sound of a band flipflopping between their origins, the accessible mainstream lure, and well-done modernization.\n\nFounding guitarist Jesper Stromblad's last appearance is marked by this album, and he did his damndest to bring back creativity and originality to In Flames after the bland but strangely enjoyable 2006 effort \"Come Clarity\". While vocalist Anders Friden, drummer-turned-guitarist Bjorn Gelotte, and Stromblad all receive writer's credit here, it's heart-wrenchingly obvious when Stromblad's writing dominates over the other two. It appears that Jesper is the only one who gave the old sound much thought here, which he demonstrates with the occasional layered guitar melodies combined with alt-rock power chords, as was the In Flames tradition back in the 90s. It's clear that he is behind the arrangements and simple but powerful thrashy riffs of \"Disconnected\" and the touching acoustic guitar part found in \"Alias\". He manages to incorporate classic In Flames elements in the right way without overdoing anything. Gelotte's writing, on the other hand, borrows from the playbook of generic accessible metal and predictable songwriting extensively, prevailing in tracks such as the lead single \"The Mirror's Truth\". He tries to live up to Stromblad's creative flair, but fails - coming off as a cheap facsimile, if even that. The styles of the two guitarists bounce off each other, as the rest of the band follows obediently. \n\nAnders Friden's vocal performance is an interesting one indeed. Having already experienced the dropping of his balls in reverse some time ago, his higher screech is preserved here, but it sounds dirtier and more mature somehow. A slight detuning effect seems to be present in his voice as well, giving the unclean vocals a darker sound. His combining of clean singing with screams is somewhat akin to what he will usually attempt in a live setting - a highly processed melodic backing track is played, with an uneven mix of cleans and uncleans being performed over the top. While still somewhat annoying, it's a tolerable & recognizable vocal style and for a while, the melodic parts aren't nearly as horrid as what was attempted on Come Clarity. Anders eventually gets delusions of grandeur, though, and pitifully whimpers and croaks in an out-of-tune way through the awful \"Chosen Pessimist\", which is thankfully this record's only attempt at a power ballad. Fitting in with the vocals, it need not be emphasized too much that this album's lyrics are emo - after all, this is the album that contains the infamous line \"I feel like shit! But at least I feel something!\" You don't need to know any more...\n\nThe vocal style and the musical indecisiveness, strangely enough, is the shot in the arm that In Flames needed to ratchet the interesting level up a few notches. While the \"classic In Flames\" parts heard on Come Clarity were, for the most part, true to what could appear on any given 90s-era album, the \"classic In Flames\" parts on this record have been sucessfully given a modern makeover. It's not a carbon copy of the 90s style on any level, but it's still recognizable as something that In Flames would do. A fair amount of cheezy, formulaic songwriting is present, no doubt, and does reduce the enjoyment factor for those who prefer to be surprised by original-sounding material. However, none of it is nearly as unimaginative & annoying as In Flames has demonstrated that they can be. \n\nThe overall sound is pleasing & accessible - and more than anything, credible. Proof is found here that In Flames had the ability at one point to modernize their sound without completely losing their defining characteristics and creative powers. This effort combines the best - and worst - of both phases of In Flames. True adherents of the 90s phase might hesitate at first listen, but this is an album that both sides can truly find common ground over, unlike the more mediocre and mainstream-influenced \"Come Clarity\". Listen as a guilty pleasure, listen and facepalm at how far the band's fallen, or listen and enjoy some decent, relatively modern In Flames. \"A Sense of Purpose\" is guaranteed to induce some combination of all three.\n",
        "\nCome Clarity, along with the turn-of-the-century effort Clayman, is easily one of the most divisive releases to appear in the discography of the Swedish melodic metal outfit In Flames. It\u2019s a release that split the band\u2019s fans down the middle - one faction of 90s adherents, and one faction of modern apologists. Of course, this particular item was released after the group had seriously wandered into softer alternative territory and the \u201cemo\u201d lyrical realm. The mildly disturbing image of a sickly-looking figure tearing its own heart out on the cover and the hastily scribbled lyrics in the liner notes immediately hint that this isn\u2019t a record along the lines of \"I bid you welcome to my world - they call me existence\", but one that most likely contains some angst-ridden whining and \u201crelatable\u201d content. Who knows why In Flames made this change, and why they seemed to flip-flop for a bit with a couple albums in the later 2000s. Perhaps they were torn between the lure of the mainstream and their roots. Perhaps they felt that a straight-forward alternative sound wasn\u2019t good enough. Maybe they wanted to please the old fans to some degree. Whatever the reason, they eventually turned out \u201cCome Clarity\u201d, a record that is, by most definitions, quite bland and devoid of original sounds.\n\nI\u2019m an unusual kind of In Flames listener. I find their 90s material to be boring and too layered, meandering on and on and never using the ample creative melodies to create memorable hooks, not to mention displaying little to no death metal influence. Nevertheless, that 90s style is a very recognizable one that can be all right when used correctly. I don\u2019t appreciate the band\u2019s modern material, either, with the formulaic songwriting, pitiful attempts at clean singing, and the deterioration of musical content on every level. Come Clarity isn\u2019t necessarily a middle ground between the two, but it, like its 2008 successor, A Sense of Purpose, has elements that would appeal to both fans of the 90s material and fans of the modern material. It\u2019s just less well-done than its aforementioned successor. \n\nThe album opens with a haymaker - the instantly classic melo-death thrasher \u201cTake This Life\u201d, which I imagine turned heads back in the day and convinced some to give the ailing group another chance. Full of earworms and containing one of frontman Anders Friden\u2019s more well-executed vocal melodies, it became one of the better-known In Flames tracks, and rightly so. Sadly, the rest of the album doesn\u2019t stay on that path, and wanders all over the place, from nu-metal to alternative to metalcore - none of them laid down as well as they could be. Classic In Flames moments show up in selections like \u201cPacing Death\u2019s Trail\u201d, feeling strangely out-of-place among the mainstream mediocrity that is the album around them. Said mainstream mediocrity as as well-written as you could expect it to be - backed by the screeches of Anders, horribly predictable at times and complete with the tailored patterns of notes and riffs that are meant to stick in your head and resemble things that you\u2019ve heard before for accessibility reasons. \n\nThis formula can be downright listenable, even enjoyable, as it is meant to be. It can also be truly cringe-worthy, as is the case with the horrid title track, a wanna-be power ballad with some of the worst clean singing/whimpering to ever be recorded, and a bare-bones formulaic arrangement to boot. It\u2019s In Flames tracks like \"Come Clarity\" that make you beg for some other accessible alternative rock band like Breaking Benjamin, who can write non-formulaic arrangements once in a while and who have a singer with both a sense of pitch and a decent vocal tone. \n\nOn the other hand, some tracks display a style that is accessible, yet credible and could have worked for the band well in later years, such as the modern thrashers \u201cVersus Terminus\u201d and \u201cVacuum\u201d (the latter contains a very rare In Flames blast beat) and the classic overtones of \u201cOur Infinite Struggle\u201d and \u201cDead End\u201d (the latter featured vocals from Lisa Miskovsky, who would, two years later, provide vocals for the theme song of the lejendary video game Mirror\u2019s Edge). None of it is as distinctive-sounding as anything from the 90s era, but it incorporates elements from that 90s era that at least give it a bit of distinction. Yet those vestigial distinctive characteristics are largely insignificant, and the album is still modern sludge that isn\u2019t a full return to classic In Flames or a full conversion to post-Stromblad In Flames. \n\nIt\u2019s strangely listenable, though. I honestly don\u2019t know exactly why I enjoy Come Clarity from time to time like I do, and despise other releases of similar styles and with similar amounts of mainstream pandering. If you\u2019re a sucker for melodic, accessible sludge that you can fall back on if you\u2019re ever craving a break from a repeated playlist of more extreme music, then this is an album that you should consider. Those who despise the mainstream pandering and/or emo screeching present in modern In Flames and any other bands that come to mind would do well to stay away from this album, however. It\u2019s divisive for a good reason.\n",
        "\nIt's a pretty well-accepted fact that In Flames' current material is a far cry from their glory days, but holy shit, I don't think anyone could have expected them to write something this fucking awful. It's actually quite impressive that the band have managed to write a song worthy of literally no merit whatsoever, but at the same time it makes an incredibly sad statement about their musical ability. I just can't comprehend how you can write this song and legitimately think it's something that should be on your next album (or something that should see the light of day at all), let alone something that should represent the album as one of the lead singles.\n\nSo, let's get into the song itself, shall we? What exactly makes it worthy of the title of \"possibly the worst thing ever made?\" The song starts with an absolutely horrid chant which I genuinely find difficult to listen to. You're a shitty alternative rock band, not one of the most influential prog bands of all time - you can't include children chanting and expect it to just work. This abomination of an intro leads into a riff, which despite being very generic isn't actually horrible and is the reason for the single point I can bring myself to award this release. \n\nThe rest of it doesn't get any better. The structure makes absolutely no sense; it jumps between verse and chorus seemingly completely randomly and there seems to be absolutely no thought put into any of it. Friden's vocals are god-awful, going between a higher singing and a lower, almost spoken style. Again, these transitions just seem careless and at times completely absurd. There's one line in what I suppose you'd call a bridge which sounds like it's actually building up to something, but instead it just trails off. There's a solo in there which comes out of nowhere, no buildup or lead-in or anything. It's almost as if they improvised it on the spot. And as if our ears hadn't bled enough, they felt the need to go back to the painful chanting from the beginning, dragging the agony out nearly a full thirty seconds longer than they ever needed to. \n\nThere are very few songs that are genuinely hard for me to listen to, but this is definitely one of them. I can only think of two or three others that can compete with this shitshow and even then I think this comes out on top. It's absolutely horrible to the point of its existence being hilarious and depressing at the same time. I don't understand how the fuck this monster came into being and I don't understand what we did to deserve being exposed to it. So thanks, In Flames.\n",
        "\nIt can be difficult for me to find a melodic death metal album that hits just the right balance of melody and aggression. Sometimes I prefer the brutal, thrashy onslaught of something like \"Slaughter of the Soul,\" and sometimes I want to listen to a synth-laden, ultra cheesy Kalmah song. \"The Jester Race\" takes somewhat of a middle ground, highlighting the gorgeous melodies and intricate guitar work, but never putting aside the aggression and power inherent in death metal.\n\n\"Moonshield,\" the album's titanic opener, is a perfect encapsulation of this album's musical style, and serves as a sort of mission statement. Delicate acoustic guitars open the song, but they soon give way to a wave of churning distortion, with the trademark guitar harmonies layered overtop. Even Anders Friden's growl has a different feeling than the typical death metal roar, it sounds more emotional than intimidating. I'm impressed by Anders Friden's ability to write lyrics with a very poetic feeling that are also somewhat abstract. I don't know what the hell a Moonshield is, but I believe every word he's saying.\n\nFrom there, the album maintains a steady pace of the more melodic songs and the more aggressive ones. It's a bold move to make the second track an instrumental, but \"The Jester's Dance\" is a nice respite, combining elegant clean sections with chugging distorted riffs. Some of the harder, more aggressive tracks actually ended up being some of my favorites. \"Graveland\" is a devastating screed against the destruction wrought by humanity, but without forgoing the sugary melodies that set In Flames apart. And then there's \"December Flower.\" Oof. What a fucking song. It's joyous, cathartic, angry, venomous, and just flat out gorgeous. It contains one of my all time favorite guitar solos in music history, one that leaves me hanging on every note.\n\nEven without Friden, the band can still make a hell of a song, as demonstrated by the instrumental piece \"Wayfaerer.\" This is possibly the only song on here that sounds downright happy. Maybe melodeath is closer to power metal than a lot of people would like to admit, but that's good in my book. \n\nThere are a few elements on here that I'm not too keen on. Friden's vocals are pretty low in the mix, and on occasion sort of dissolve into the rhythm guitar. It would be nice to hear his voice a little more distinctly. And of all songs to be the dud on here, the title track isn't too memorable. But these minor quibbles aside, this is a great album, and it's worth the listen for anyone into melodeath.\n",
        "\nI don't care what anyone says about newer In Flames minus Jesper...I like I, The Mask. The rhythms, the vibe, the vocals, the leads and the overall essence of In Flames now. I think their new guitarists have some shoes to fill with Jesper out of the lineup. But they did a great job on this album! The rhythms were phenomenal. I liked this CD so much I ordered a CD of it on Amazon. Yes, the In Flames of the old is gone people, that's never going to change. If those think that they should've changed their name changing their style, so be it. But they didn't. So just accept that they're playing more melodic/metalcore. \n\nNot every song is the same, you get different tempos, some aggression but they're just being passionate here. I slander those who've given up on the band. So they changed their style, but what about the good that they've done with their guitar playing and vocal efforts. They're never going back to their solid melodic death metal roots. That era is gone. I did like a lot of their releases and 'Siren Charms' as well. So they have a lifetime fan of mine. They just play around with styles and melodies. Everything on here is simply awesome. Don't listen to the naysayers, they're wrong. Form your own opinion about the band now!\n\nThe clean vocals I like, I tend to get weary of chronic screaming on vocals. I do like the fact that they sing more rather than just scream. The guitars are brilliant. They've put together some seriously awesome rhythms! The leads are flawless. They're quite technical as well. The band changes the songs around a lot on here. It's mostly a slow tempo of distorted riffs mixed with clean guitar. It's like they're singing as if they're in a symphony. Remember, this is the same band that you loved when they put out 'The Jester Race', 'Whoracle', 'Colony', and so on. They chose a different path now. Just accept it!\n\nI would suggest that you listen to this on Spotify or YouTube first to see if it's something experimental and new. I found the the first few listens to I liked the album right away. So yes, I went ahead and got the CD. It's showing the band support for what they're doing now. It's nothing to discard from your In Flames discography that you may have. Just be patient. The vibe will return and yes it's a little \"happier\" than previous releases. However, if you liked 'Siren Charms' then you'll probably like this. Test it out to see. People who defy the fact that In Flames's music went viral with the new sound. Own this, it's worth it At least give it a shot.\n",
        "\nWhen I found out that In Flames was making a new album, I was honestly pretty skeptical, But I honestly feel like most of us were. In Flames were legends back in ye olde days, but it seems like most people have given up on them. They obviously went more metalcore, but honestly, if they're metalcore, they're the best metalcore I've ever heard, so they have that going for them. \n\nThe album as a whole is actually pretty good. For most of the songs, you can actually feel the soul. There are just a few exceptions to that such as in This is Our House. Honestly I expected garbage from this album, but it is not what we got. Even though the album could mostly be considered metalcore, it doesn't have that emo sound like a bunch of dumb teenagers complaining about their girlfriend that left them or whatever bull crap. They seem to be staying out of that kind of stuff. Keep in mind that In Flames are definitely not the melodeath legends that they once were, but now I'd definitely say they're at the top of the metalcore totem pole. \n\nThe vocals are actually pretty good, focusing mostly on the cleans, which is probably a good thing. The aggressive vocals are decent, but they are far from perfect. In Flames's drum and rhythm guitarists are actually very very good. As for the leads, they're nothing special, but they're still very good. They even threw in some solos here and there, so I can't really complain about that. One problem is that the bass seems to be pretty quiet in the mix, but it's not that bad. \n\nNow, there were a lot of good surprises in the album, too. Some of them are pretty shocking in a good way. In Follow me, they had a key change and, they had one in a couple of other songs, and they were great. It has been forever since I've heard a good key change in a metal song, so that was a very nice surprise. It was hilarious and great at the same time, but Deep Inside's Arabian sounding intro and riffs were really cool. \n\nMost of the album was pretty good, but, like I mentioned previously, some of the songs were pretty weak. None were bad, but a lot of them were pretty forgettable. Which every way you look at it, the album is a major step up. All in all, the album itself was a pretty pleasant surprise in the sense that it wasn't utter crap, so I rate it 82/100. It was a good listen, and it'll probably be in my rotation for a while.\n",
        "\nIn Flames has always progressively changed and shifted its sound to become one of the most versatile and exciting bands in the melodic death metal genre. I, the Mask is the first album where the band sounds somewhat directionless and rehashes numerous past ideas which makes this release the quintet's worst studio release to date. \n\nThe album features mellower tracks like ''Follow Me'' with its acoustic guitars, heavily processed clean vocals, epic riffs and unspectacular rhythm section that might be explained due to the fact that the two American musicians on bass guitar and drums might not have had a major impact on the song writing process since they only joined the Swedish band last year. The record also includes rawer tunes like the chugging, down-tuned and sinister ''I Am Above'' that focuses on gritty guttural vocals. Most tracks are however somewhere in between like opener ''Voices'' that adds some modern sound experiments to the combination of aggressive verses and a melodic chorus. The record's calmer moments recall soft predecessor Battles while the harsher sounds are inspired by Come Clarity. In a certain way, the band itself wears masks it had already put on three years earlier and ten years before that. What the record is missing however is a proper identity.\n\nA few select songs manage to stick out positively. ''(This Is Our) House'' is a courageous and innovative song that opens with refreshing gang shouts, combines almost robotic low vocals, repressed screams and slightly high-pitched clean vocals in a most dynamic way and has an overall floating, melodic and otherworldly vibe that creates a unique atmosphere which makes this track the most interesting one on the record. Bonus track ''Not Alone'' has a similar approach that could have served as the record's guideline as it once again features almost robotic low vocals that are contrasted by slightly processed high-pitched vocals in the chorus. Another solid tune that walks off the beaten path is ''Deep Inside'' that mixes decently employed electronic elements with Middle Eastern guitar sounds without getting away from the band's signature melodic death metal style.\n\nIn Flames' thirteenth studio album isn't a failure but could rather be described as a compilation mixing the mellow soundscapes of Battles with the harsher passages of Come Clarity. Two tracks stick out with diversified vocal performances mixing robotic low vocals, repressed screams and slightly processed high-pitched vocals over otherworldly vibes. If the band had used these two great tracks as guideline for a more coherent release, the final result could have sounded quite groundbreaking. As it is now, I, the Mask is certainly entertaining for fans of contemporary In Flames but ultimately only offers more of the same without a clear concept. The versatile vocals and excellent guitar play need to be pointed out while the unspectacular rhythm section and synthetic sound are slightly frustrating. The song material might actually sound much more dynamic in concert with a more energetic rhythm section and the absence of an artificial mastering, mixing and production.\n\nIf you are a fan of In Flames' recent records, you can't go wrong with I, the Mask. While not being a failure, this record might though be the band's weakest effort to date. At the end of the day, this record is still slightly above average and recommendable for genre fans but far from being mandatory. If you are looking for creative contemporary melodic death metal or metalcore with a coherent concept, listen to Erra's Neon and Soilwork's Verkligheten.\n",
        "\nI always thought people exaggerated a bit when talking about how awful In Flames has become. I liked a few songs from their mid career albums such as Come Clarity and Reroute to Remain, as well as another song from even more recent from their career. It then came to my attention that In Flames had released new music, so I thought why not try this single out.\n\nIt has become hard to pigeonhole In Flames into one genre. This song is seemingly a mix of nu-metal, pop music, and maybe even a bit of power metal.The song starts off with a terrible rebellious sounding cringe-inducing chant. I was hoping this was just a hiccup and that In Flames would make up for this terrible intro with the music. Boy was I wrong. \n\nThe song then kicks off into a boring nu-metal style riff (nothing against the genre). The drumming is horrendously boring and the bass really can\u2019t be heard. It\u2019s all been nothing of worth so far, but we haven\u2019t even got to the worst part yet: the vocals. God are these vocals terrible. There are 0 interesting vocal melodies, and Anders\u2019 voice sounds horrible. There is a chorus that is a horrible attempt at uplifting and reminds me of radio rock/pop (in the worst way possible).\n\nThe last hope was lost during the guitar solo. It was probably the best part of the song, despite being horrible, because you get a break from the terrible vocal performance and the solo had a nice guitar tone. The actual solo though amounted to nothing offering nothing thought or emotion provoking.\n\nAs if the song wasn\u2019t bad enough, they brought back the shitty chant from the beginning at the end of the song for good measure. This song is an embarassing abomination. I am now in full agreement with those who blast In Flames saying they\u2019ve gone to shit. Thank goodness At the Gates and Dark Tranquility are still going strong, cause In Flames has most certainly gone off the deep end, and I have no hope for them ever redeeming themselves. Good riddance.\n",
        "\nAs i stated in my previous review, the task of staying original and fresh throughout your career is hard to accomplish. In Flames evolved radically since \"Clayman\", and every album following that release presented drastic changes in sound and songwriting. The process culminated with \"Come Clarity\", still the best post-2000 In Flames album, that perfectly blended old and new to craft an exciting hour of original music. It's no surprise that \"A Sense Of Purpose\" sees the band yet again turning the tables, this time taking the alternative rock elements to their maximum extent, resulting in something that, indeed, sounds like an alternative rock album with Gothenburg school melodeath influences, more than a metal album.\n\n\"A Sense of Purpose\" is extremely commercially oriented, and, although really different from anything the band has composed before, it doesn't disown In Flame's roots. Thanks to its great radio rock appeal, the album was a huge commercial success, achieving gold status in Sweden and being responsible for bringing the band new listeners, more accustomed to modern rock music. Talking about the music more in deep, the first thing one can notice is the production placed on the album: it's really soft, trying to make things as digestible as possible: the guitars in particular, although sounding good especially when it comes to their tone, have almost lost their aggressive edge. The guitar work is indeed another thing that distinguishes \"A Sense Of Purpose\" from its predecessor: almost the entirety of the album's guitar arrangements consists of groovy, catchy hooks, that, although sounding melodic and well-composed, may result in a sense of homogeneity and lack of variety, also due to the fact that most of the songs stick to mid-tempos. The melodies in traditional In Flames fashion are still present (think to \"Alias\", or \"The Mirror's Truth\"), although they're less omnipresent than what we saw in \"Come Clarity\" and generally they're less memorable, which is a bit of a shame. The bass is, as usual, doing his work while being unnoticed, while the drumming, although solid and varied, especially when it comes to the double bass, doesn't reach the peaks of aggression and technicality the band had accustomed us to.\n\nThe increased employment of keyboards, sampling and synthetizers is reminescent of the \"Reroute to Remain\" days, while the thing that strikes the most the listener are surely the vocals. This time, Anders Frid\u00e9n partly abandons his usual screams and the occasional growls, to stick more to a melodic style of singing, with a lot of clean and, occasionally, graspy vocals. Adding the fact that, especially during the choruses, there are lots of choral arrangements, one can easily see why the album is considered \"poppish\" and \"radio friendly\" when compared to any previous In Flames' work, and although accessibility was probably what the band was aiming for, sometimes it's just too much for the album's own good. Lyrics are focused on the same topics as \"Come Clarity\", and, although generally well constructed, in some rare cases they can be a bit cheesy or too \"edgy\".\n\nSpeaking of the songwriting, it's generally good, the tracks are groovy, catchy, melodic and accessible, and although there are several highlights, don't expect songs that will blow you out of your chair like \"Take This Life\", \"Leeches\", \"Only For The Weak\", \"Pinball Map\" and so on. Surely the album's core is perfectly embodied in the opener \"The Mirror's Truth\", a song that relies on catchy riffing, well-constructed guitar melodies, a quite fast tempo, solid drum work and an instantly recognizable singalong chorus. \"Alias\" is a mid-paced, emotional song, where Anders really shines, once again melodies are top-notch and they're complemented by the synthetizers and the choruses, making up for another melancholic, catchy track. \"Delight and Angers\" is probably the album's best, concealing aggression, melody, awesome guitar work and memorable vocal lines in a three minutes and a half track that is partly reminiscent of In Flames' past work. \"The Chosen Pessimist\" is the track where the band experimented the most, and successfully I must add: an eight minute long emotional journey, completed by great synth work, violins, the frontman's great clean vocals, and a simple yet heavy distorted guitar session, similar to what we saw in the previous album's closing track. The CD is closed by the punchy \"March to the Shore\", once again reminescent of In Flames' \"Come Clarity\" days, featuring a once again catchy chorus.\n\n\"A Sense Of Purpose\" is the album where In Flames definitely stuck to alternative rock, although here the result is honestly pretty good; the following releases, unfortunately, were far from the quality of this record, and kinda stained the band's legacy. Wether the new album will, at least partly, redeem the band's name once again, is yet to be seen: for now, I just feel like recommending this album to any alternative rock/metal aficionado.\n",
        "\nBeing pioneers of a musical genre is always a hard task. On one hand, you have to stay true to your roots and you mustn't abandon the sound you're famous and praised for; on the other hand, you inevitably risk to fall in the realms of unoriginality and repetitivness, creating albums that seem one the copy of the other. Swedish melodeath's fathers In Flames have always been aware of this, and indeed, they tried to evolve their sound, without disowning their origins. Things changed after Clayman, an album that is seen by a lot of fans as the \"turning point\"; it's undeniable that the record presented different traits from its predecessors, paving the way for a lot of modern metal acts and genres. \"Reroute to Remain\" furtherly expanded and developed the \"alternative metal\" vein of In Flames, but it's with \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\" that the band went really too far, venturing forth in the realms of metalcore and, under some aspects, nu metal too.\n\nBut right when the band seemed to be lost, they came out in 2006 with \"Come Clarity\", an album that redeemed their name and earned them once again the respect of fans and critics alike. So, why is \"Come Clarity\" so special? Well, first of all, it successfully integrates the old-school Gothenburg sound of early In Flames with their post-2000 alternative metal influences, to create something fresh, original and at the same time true to their melodeath roots, fulfilling the hard task of evolving one's own sound without denaturalizing it. Secondly, the songwriting is once again top notch, reaching peaks of excellence we hadn't witnessed since the Clayman era. \n\nWith \"Come Clarity\" we welcome the return of the awesome twin guitar harmonies and melodies that made In Flame's fortune since their early days. Anders Friden's vocals sound thundering and full of aggression once again, reaching high peaks and staying catchy while capable of performing both deep growls and high screams alike. The clean vocals are still present, but avoiding the excesses of the previous record, thus resulting pleasant to listen and adding variety to the CD. The guitar riffs space from groovy, to thrashy, to tremolo-picked, making each song interesting, well-constructed and varied, yet mantaining a general sense of cohesion between the various tracks. The solos tend to focus more on the melodic side than on shredding, but they can prove rather technical at times. The drumming is insane, just think to the opening track to have a good taste of it; the bass work is solid although not particular outstanding. The production is wonderful, every instrument sounds fantastic and has plenty of space to breathe, especially the guitars, that sounds polished but at the same time punchy and aggressive. Spot on the excellent work done with the vocal's overlayering and the effects placed upon them in certain parts. Last but not at least, the lyrics, that have really improved from the previous effort, and sound mature, introspective and deep more than ever, dealing with themes of life struggles, inner battles and society's contradictions.\n\nLet's talk about the songs. Opening track \"Take This Life\", In Flames' most famous anthem, is also probably the best of the CD. It amalgamates perfectly all the elements I mentioned above: insane drumming, thrilling riffing, fantastic harmonized guitar melodies, great lyrics, immediately recognizable vocal lines, an immense chorus and an insane vocal performance by Anders, spacing from growl, to screams, to shrieks, to clean sung vocals throughout the duration of the song. Blasting you at 240 bpms, \"Take This Life\" completely succeeds in starting off the party in the right way. Following track \"Leeches\" has more of a mid-paced tempo and a groovy riffing, once again vocals are amazing, the song results extremely catchy, especially when it comes to the chorus, Anders is able to amalgamate perfectly different vocal styles, and the guitar melodies are nothing short of amazing. Other highlights are \"Dead End\", made memorable by the pathos-fueled duet between our beloved frontman and the guest-vocalist Lisa Miskovsky, providing a fantastic performance; \"Scream\", thanks to the choral arrangements, its speed, aggression and the fantastic tremolo picked riffs; the title track \"Come Clarity\", a moving power ballad completed by an extremely emotional solo; \"Crawl Through Knives\", thanks to the awesome vocal harmonies; and the last track, \"Your Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone\", which, besides having a really cool title, sees the band experimenting perfectly, with a long, almost ambient piano-driven intro, complemented by excellent sampling, and a simple, heavy and emotional sung part towards the end, ending the album with a reference to one of heavy metal's most famous bands.\n\nReally, what else should I say to convince you? This album has everything, the quality here is plain for everyone to see. If you like In Flames, go and get it, if you like melodic death metal, go and get it, if you like alternative metal, go and get it. In either case, you can be sure of this: you'll absolutely love it.\n",
        "\nIt is common knowledge that In Flames\u2019 discography evidences a journey from notable promise through the mundane and into the irrelevant. The early to mid-second wave was a fruitful era in history and it is there that we begin our story. In Flames roared onto the scene with a chip on their shoulder \u2013 an idiosyncratic approach to death metal melding the grit of a black metal-esc style with the flavourful virtuosity of folk melody. And while they may not have been the first to mix this type of concoction, Subterranean is case and point of how it can be done proper and it is this that makes the fall of their enterprise so sour; the carelessly tossed cigarette beneath the wreckage just outright ignorance toward their roots and, most disappointingly, a potentially loyal fan base. As we explore the early stages of their evolution, an honest black/folk-inspired mantra pervades right through to their third release, The Jester Race. So that the Swedish titans would once manage to forge gold in the melding of black and death comes as no surprise. That is what we have here in this EP. Subterranean is an artifact to be excavated from the ruins of a titan laid low by seemingly natural causes.\n\nI struggle to liken this special effort to anything else but this: unadulterated, vintage In Flames. Subterranean kicks-off with a melodic passage at the outset \u2013 a harbinger of the tasteful balanced design of the record. This sort of additive (seen, for instance, in the outro of \u201cEver Dying\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d) in contrast with the to-ing and fro-ing of folk-inspired / searing black metal-influenced riffs, in addition to the wretched vocals of guest vocalist Henke Forss (who earns a nod with this superb performance) makes for a listening experience that is lavish in character. If extreme yet melodic without the white bread production or single-skew pit-in-the-gut approach is what you seek, this album should be way up on your to-do\u2019s. All in all, the EP boasts a unique style, but it is a solitary effort shrouded in mystery by the Swedish pioneers. The line-up seen here would ne\u2019er be seen again, with the In Flames of today being comprised of completely different musicians than those heard on Subterranean. One small item that did live on albeit for a short time was track \u201cThe Inborn Lifeless\u201d, which is notably the same base track as \u201cDead God in Me\u201d of The Jester Race. Also noteworthy is the thematic imagery depicted in the sleeve art. More often than not in the black/death + folk arena, a gelid atmosphere is a humdrum part of the overall execution...but there is something fittingly scorching here, a reddish tinge that is difficult to narrate. That is simply to say that themes are constant throughout and the continuity of the arrangements herein is top-notch second wave material.\n",
        "\nThe people who say In Flames used to be a gold standard of metal need to get their privilege checked (as well as their hearing). Now yes, this album has some fun moments and some cool moments but the problem is they're mixed in with a lot of terrible ideas that just don't belong in metal!\n\nTake opener Bullet Ride for example. Spectacular opening riff, you expect it to come in on a groove time, but that's ok, because this riff earned it. But then expectations are subverted and raise by the death from the skies thrash drumbeat that double-times the song! How could this possibly suck? Then at 0:38, OH? Oh. Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. Ultraboris called stuff like this \"the assrape.\" I'm a little too old to call it that, but I will say that your ass will need to expunge as a result of a brown note being hit so hard it made the Sarlacc Pit have an event horizon. Who put this Korn vinyl on and why did someone set the RPM at 33 1/3 instead of 45? But upon further scrupulous scrutiny, you realize the sheer horror, almost too late....it's still Bullet Ride? Melodic death metal? Seems more like the kids who got scared shitless when being played real death metal tried to make their own castrated version with a little help from Life Is Peachy. Look folks, extreme metal is not for everyone. I get it, I won't judge you for not liking Autopsy and Morbid Angel. What I will judge you for is trying to make it something it's not by using counterintuitive conclusions. Stick with power metal, actually more often than not they play faster than In Flames do. If it's speed you wanted. Oh and that riff does come back as a chorus riff, and we even get it in the groove you expected it to be at the beginning of the song, but do you honestly care at that point? It's like a girl wanting to suck your dick after you shit your pants. You just don't feel dignified enough.\n\nThings don't fare too much better with the next song, Pinball Map, which, yes, is the best song on here and is thrashy at times. But after a while you just think \"I'd rather be listening to Slaughter of the Soul, which did this way better. Or Gamma Ray, who cruises at this speed with considerably less Johnson & Johnson shampoo, and could solo better.\" \n\nThe rest of this album depressingly juggles between those two song speeds. So called \"fan favorite\" Only For The Weak sounds like it was laughed out of the room by Children of Bodom and was supposed to show up to the Follow The Reaper sessions but it took a wrong turn at Albuquerque. Another Day in Quicksand sounds like it will be a kickass Blazon Stone forgotten track but the death metal vocals come in and ruin the vibe, like all death metal covers of songs with actual singing do. Either it's just plain mediocre (Suburban Me, Swim) or it starts out with a great idea only to trip and drop it into a pile of cow-poop (Square Nothing, no wait, that was just cow poop). Then they pick it up and eat it anyway rather than accept the wasted money and move on. Iron Maiden harmonies and detuned death metal chords just don't go together. It seems to work somewhat well for black metal, but that might almost be because of a militant anti-Americanism.\n\nMelodic death metal my ass. Even Johnathan Davis sounded like he was doing death metal growls at times. This is a nu-metal album, plain and simple. Just this time they took slightly more inspiration from Ride The Lightning instead of the Black Album.\n",
        "\nDuring the 90's a new wave of death metal was paving its way from the underground, hailing from Gothenburg, Sweden. The three main artists within the Gothenburg scene, At The Gates and Dark Tranquillity along with In Flames are regarded as the forefathers of the melodic death metal genre. \n\nThe 1996 seminal melodic death metal album \"The Jester Race\" is considered one of the pioneering albums of the genre, along with the band's contemporaries pioneering efforts \"Slaughter of the Soul\" by At The Gates and \"The Gallery\" by Dark Tranquillity. All three of these releases are considered key releases in the history of heavy metal. The sound these three bands pioneered would go on to inspire and influence a lot of the American metalcore acts of the 2000's, some of which including metalcore bands Trivium, and As I Lay Dying. \n\nThree years on from the success of The Jester Race and In Flames released the somewhat pivotal album Colony, this album has a big emphasis on big soaring melodies over brutality, as a result of this some fans were left with a bad taste in their mouth with this record claiming it was too commercial in the songwriting. Upon the first note of the opening track Embody the Invisible, we're met with a soaring lead guitar melody which is somewhat reminiscent of power metal in a way. \n\nThis is the most epic sounding album In Flames has released, it has a greater amount of kinetic energy than any other record this band has put out, and is blistering fast. There's a lot of riffs and melodies on this thing that are infectiously catchy, while retaining the brutality of the death metal sound. However, this album tends to emphasise melody a little more than it does death metal. The album is 60% melody and 40% brutality, meaning this album has a lot of accessible value for newcomers to the world of extreme metal. Due to it's catchy riffing and soaring melodies, a good example for this being the chorus riff from Zombie Inc, it's WAY too catchy. \n\nThe track Behind Space '99 has a dramatic, dark and sinister tone to it, there is a lot of drama and theatrics at play with the sound on this album in the lead guitars. The solos on this album compliment the songs well and aren't too technical, but they aren't anti-climactic, you aren't going to be left with blue balls. Zombie Inc, Embody the Invisible and Coerced Coexistence, all contain some tasty solos. The production on this album is really good and the album is pretty well mixed, aside from the very loud crash cymbals which could have done with a bit of work, at times I find myself being barraged by an overwhelming wall of harsh sounding crash cymbals being hit. \n\nThis album is consistent throughout and there is not a single boring song on this thing, they all have their unique charm and have something different to offer, Ordinary Story has a big contrast in dynamics and is almost the bands first \"ballad\", it transitions from clean vocals accompanied by sinister and melancholic piano keys and then transcends into total heaviness with C standard tuned guitars and growled vocals. \n\nA lot of the lyrical themes on this album concern morality and coming to terms with the ways of the world. Ordinary Story as I perceived it to be was a song about Anders' struggle to come to terms with the capitalistic dog-eat-dog culture of the western world and having to step on others to get ahead in life. An example of this being the lyric \"Forced to be, someone I don't want to be. I am losing myself, sinking deeper down I am caught in the world wound web\". Zombie Inc. contains similar lyrical themes and is essentially a mockery of the shallow and sheep-minded members of society, hence the title of the song and this is further evidenced in the line \"Shallowness, and beauty. Was all that concerned her body. But the soul, her divine guest was thrust to the bottom.\" Implying this she in question is devoid of moral ground and shallow. \n\nOverall in my opinion this is the most well-crafted album In Flames has released, the musicianship is at its peak, there's a lot of catchy riffs and melodies and the album ends way too quickly and that's saying something because this thing has 13 TRACKS! This album is a blast to listen through. The lyricism is personal but also insightful, and the themes discussed gel with the album title very well. There\u2019s some nice interlude tracks such as Pallar Anders Visa after 5 tracks of total heaviness to mellow down things a notch.\n\nMy verdict\nI am giving it a 100% mark, this is an album I insist you put into your metal collection.\n",
        "\nGothenburg greats In Flames return with a surprise end of year EP launching to coincide with their FFDP UK headlining tour. An EP consisting of covers; Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, Alice in Chains and Chris Isaak. \n\nIt's clear by now that In Flames have continued towards their alternative rock sound since the release of Battles, and this cover EP continues that trend. It's very much driven by electronic beats, synth-lead elements and very little guitar work from Bjorn Gelotte, nor Joe Rickard's drumming. \n\nAnders' clean vocals take centre stage and, this late in their career, you either love his voice or you don't. I personally happen to really appreciate Anders' soaring highs and was especially shaken by his anger induced screams during the live rendition of Hurt. \n\nThe songs being covered themselves are all catchy and enjoyable for what they are. It's a synth rock EP. The band is getting older, they are covering songs they liked when they were young and the passion shows. It's a fun, brief time for what it is. It's not metal, it's a big departure from anything they have done before and I personally enjoy it on its own merit, but I know many won't share my sentiment. \n\nIt's produced well. Everything sounds striking and sharp. The melodies are still there, they have just manifested in unorthodox ways. It's surprising, completely unexpected and commendable for being something different, something unique and special. \n\nIn Flames are no stranger to cover songs, and in 1997 on their Whoracle record the band covered Everything Counts by Depeche Mode. It's been a long and winding road for the band in 20 years; Colony, Clayman, Reroute to Remain etc. all these albums have all come and gone. All these styles were worn with pride and now In Flames are a heavy metal band. \n\nIf you weren't a fan of Battles, or of the album's released without Jesper Stromblad, then this EP won't convince you otherwise but for fans of the band who stay with them no matter what, there's going to be enough here to enjoy.\n",
        "\nReally, why do In Flames even bother anymore? They haven\u2019t put out anything worth a listen in ages, so why did I bother to check out this album when it appeared as a suggestion on Youtube? I knew it was going to be frustrating at best, but I played it nonetheless. Seriously, fuck my curiosity...\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard anything starting with A Sense of Purpose, you know what to expect, alternative rock with scattered traces of melodic death metal. Regarding those traces, all I can say is \u2018for fuck\u2019s sake, In Flames, stop throwing us bones!\u2019 And those traces are the least bad part of this album. I say \u2018least bad\u2019 because none of them are worth mentioning, they exist, nothing more. Someone could\u2019ve made an actually listenable song out of those, but not In Flames, it's well-known they don\u2019t give a shit anymore. The bass is next to impossible to hear, while the drums are just there, because they have to be present, I guess. As for the sections played on keyboards, as before, they serve no purpose whatsoever and are completely out of place, so why did they bother writing those in the first place? I won\u2019t make examples, there is simply nothing worth taking out.\n\nAnders Frid\u00e9n is awful, as has been the case for years. When he tries to sing, he moans and wails, but what did anyone expect anyway? When he tries to growl... Oh, actually, there is nothing that deserves to be called a growl, so no use talking about that. He does use 'harsh vocals', however. And there\u2019s a reason why I wrote it between quotation marks, because, believe it or not, they sound like he needs laxatives due to serious constipation problems. Yes, I wrote that, he sounds like he\u2019s taking a shit. And I wish I could stop at that, but there is one new element when it comes to singing on this album... children's choir. That\u2019s right, they dragged some children to provide backing vocals in a few seconds. How pretentious can musicians get? Dragging innocent kids into whatever crap you came up with? In Flames, you scum, you are not Pink Floyd and you will never write Another Brick in the Wall, so don\u2019t drag kids into this! (huff) Sorry for this tirade, I had no choice... I feel sorry for those kids; one day, at least some of them will wake up thinking, \u2018My god, I actually agreed to that? Yuck...\u2019 And... no, I\u2019m not talking about the lyrics, no way, angst this band\u2019s become known for is too disgusting for me to even think about. (shudder)\n\nWhen it comes to song structure, there are no surprises, In Flames try to emulate alternative rock and pop. But it\u2019s even more frustrating now that it was, because it\u2019s obvious they don\u2019t give a shit anymore for whatever they write, how disjointed the end result is... I mean, nobody can combine pop, alternative rock, emo, melodic death metal and mallcore and come up with anything worth a damn, no matter how hard anyone were to try. Winds of Plague\u2019s Decimate the Weak was very disjointed, but it\u2019s, at the very least, way more coherent than this shit and they at least tried to combine genres that have connection to metal. Singing a slimy singalong chorus over riffs old In Flames would\u2019ve rejected outright and would\u2019ve been ashamed to write, while supported by drums that may as well have been programmed, with keyboards that make random sounds that are, aside from being pointless, also often hard to hear? This sounds like a recipe for disaster, not for writing songs. However, the band obviously doesn't think so. And the result is... (sigh) MORE WORTHLESS SHIT!\n\nI cannot believe I\u2019m about to say this, but, all things considered, this is worse than Soundtrack to Your Escape. That\u2019s it! As far as I\u2019m concerned, In Flames died with this album. And Anders really needs to take his laxatives. As for me, I need a good album to wash away the bad taste this... foul thing leaves behind.\n",
        "\nDown, Wicked & No Good is a surprise release by In Flames that features four cover songs inspired by original material from Alice in Chains, Chris Isaac, Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails. The band collaborated with Depeche Mode and even took over the band's Facebook page in order to promote In Flames' cover of ''It's No Good''. Aside of a few minor hints and snippets, this digital release wasn't however much promoted and seems to be a project the band did for fun and not for commercial purposes. Those who are accusing the band to sell out haven't understood that the group simply wants to experiment stylistically at all costs.\n\nIn Flames has become one of the world's most controversial metal bands over the past years because the group shifted its style from melodic death metal towards alternative rock with electronic elements. However, In Flames has been an experimental outfit throughout its entire career and had already covered Depeche Mode twenty years earlier on the critically acclaimed Whoracle record. The difference between ''Everything Counts'' two decades ago and ''It's No Good'' now is that the former song gave a Depeche Mode track a classic In Flames vibe while the latter is much closer to the original song and experiments with clean vocals and electronic elements. Still, the new song doesn't blandly copy Depeche Mode but explores a more contemporary synthpop soundscape. If Depeche Mode had written the song this year and not twenty years ago, I could actually sound like In Flames' version. This reinvention of the track is more surprising than what In Flames accomplished twenty years ago but it will also rather please synthpop fans than melodic death metal supporters.\n\nThis is also the case for the other three cover songs. In order to fully appreciate them, you need quite broad preferences and should appreciate the original artists rather than what In Flames might have stood for in its early career. Even by In Flames' contemporary standards, Down, Wicked & No Good is one of the band's most radical releases. It doesn't have anything to do with any metal or even rock subgenres and can be categorized a synthpop. If the name In Flames weren't associated with this release, it would actually be hard to believe that the Swedish group is actually behind this. In Flames' version of Alice in Chains' ''Down in a Hole'' is even more melodic, mellow and introspective than the original track. Instead of making the original material heavier as it would have been the case twenty years ago, In Flames now explores genres which are similar to the original tracks and focuses on a danceable, dreamy and electronic twist to the four songs chosen for this release.\n\nIf I were only a metal connoisseur, I would despise and reject this release and I can easily understand anyone criticizing this unusual output. However, thanks to my father, I have also grown up with music of the gothic scene and attended festivals where I could witness a vast spectrum of bands including synthpop artists. Even though the latter genre isn't my favorite, I can occasionally appreciate it and am able to judge what good or band synthpop is. What In Flames offers here is quite thoughtful, melodic and atmospheric synthpop that sounds unique, modern and fresh. I wouldn't listen to Down, Wicked & No Good on a regular base, but if I felt like listening to some unique and calm synthpop to relax, I would definitely go for this release. Surprisingly, despite being a first effort in its genre, this release is already a genre highlight and proves how talented and versatile the band is. I wouldn't be surprised if the band's next release were a new age or trip hop record and if it actually sounded really great. In Flames seems to be an amorphous band that could play pretty much anything it aspires stylistically as we speak, except maybe for classical music. No matter what you think about the final result, this disposition is absolutely astonishing.\n\nThe bottom line is that this surprising release is very good for what it is but that I can only digest it in small doses because it isn't exactly my favorite type of music.\n",
        "\nI was once a fan of the classic works of one of the pioneers of melodic death metal, In Flames. The band's debut album \"Lunar Strain\" and their sophomore \"The Jester Race\" had all the goods that you can find in a melodic death metal record. EP's like \"Subterranean\" and \"Black-Ash Inheritance\" were also both decent releases that are worthy of adding into metalheads' album collections. And then along the line, after finding success in the mainstream metal scene, the band's musicianship and overall song writing declined. They became boring and less interesting.\n\nA band who once broke new grounds, and helped introduced a new sub-genre of heavy metal, is now just a mere shadow of its former mighty rank. The band suffered a great decay for selling out their music to the popular audiences. Those who knew the band well and had heard their earlier crafts can totally understand what I am talking about.\n\nThe band's contemporary released \"Battles\", which went out last November 11th of the year 2016 under the banner of Nuclear Blast, is a living proof of In Flames's continues descend to mediocrity. This release appeared worse in quality like the previous seven records, starting from their new millennium release \"Clayman\" up to \"Siren Charms\", that they had put out. Gone are the memorable melodies, remarkable riffs, and powerful and catchy drum work that was once strongly present in early In Flames offerings.\n\nThe guitar work here is really lousy and pathetic. The riffs are at a bottom level than of that what the band had provided decades ago. And the drums are very generic. I think even modern deathcore drummers can do better than what Joe Rickard had provided behind the kit in this offering. The lyrical content also showed the band's deteriorating song writing ability. Bj\u00f6rn and Anders came out like little wankers trying to write lyrics for teenage girls just to score a pussy. I still can't believe that the creativity of a group who released the highly praised \"Subterranean\" had totally collapsed.\n\nThis album is entirely made up of continued sequence of mainstream heavy alternative metal tracks plaited together to form an insipid record. And yes, like the other modern releases that the band had produced, Anders Friden's formerly impressive growl cannot be found in this offering. This whole album was clearly fabricated to catch the attentions of scene kids and trendy hipsters. After listening to \"Battles\", I had come to a conclusion that In Flames are not willing to go and finally make a new album that would contain a pack of punch and would amuse their old school fans.\n\nI really cannot find any more reason to still listen to this trash of an album again. Fellow extreme music connoisseurs, stay away from any new release that these guys are going to put out. The band had made it clear to us that they are having so much joy in producing run-of-the-mill metal music. This whole thing is just miserably inadequate in every way.\n",
        "\nNowadays, reviewing an In Flames album seems more like an exercise in writing than anything else; something to keep your fingers sharp, since you can be sure there will be nary a surprise or, God forbid, a few heartstrings pulled whatsoever. Having long ago given up on taking these Swedes seriously, \"Battles\" all but flew under my radar, thus my finding of its existence was nothing short of an accident thanks to former axeman Jesper Stromblad himself, who commented about a new release by his ex group, thus prompting yours truly to yet again sit through a post 2000s In Flames record out of morbid curiosity and, to be honest, a little boredom. Considering these guys' recent track record and the apparent discordance between the minimalist title and the hipsteriffic cover, I smirked as I pressed play, knowing exactly what lay before me.\n\nIf you're one of those who also took this journey, then it's no use reminding the leads and catchy melodies are all but afterthoughts, replaced by waves upon waves of unremarkable riffs, soloing that feels more like a contractual obligation than a form of expression, and, to my perpetual chagrin, navel-gazing lyricism ranging from cringe worthy to awkward. \"Battles\" is filled with words trying their damnedest to just be there because they need to (since an entirely hummed album would seem too experimental, I guess), hardly conjuring up any images or feelings at all, instead - much like the rhythm guitars and drums - existing inside a factory-esque void of generic self-loathing aimed at... whom? Scene kids still gobble up stuff such as \"I can't wait to hear your voice again\\I am far from lonely but without you I'm a mess\"? In the future of In Flames' catalogue, there will never again be anything like the expressionistic, eye-catching verve of \"Artifacts of the Black Rain\", the implied horrors of abuse of \"Dead God in Me\" or even the halfway clever wordplay of \"In Search for I\". Now, there is \"You killed the part of me that kept us alive\", so get used to it.\n\nOn a general note, the entire thing consists of an overlong series of heavy rock songs laced with forgettable keyboards, with the only elements distinguishing it from a run of the mill alternative or groove album being the eventual throwaway guitar harmonies, an overall lack of a self-conscious swagger that would maybe paint it with a comical tinge akin to Adrenaline Mob, and the breathy vocal performance from Anders Friden, who, despite having stepped beyond his early disastrous attempts at clean singing, is still annoying in his nasal inflection, which displays a squeaky, desperate character to it that is less akin to his better adapted contemporaries like Stanne or Strid, and more to a deeper take on Jared Leto.\n\nEven the hooks, which are the only thing In Flames still have left, are hit and miss at best, leading us to the only worthwhile track: \"Wallflower\". Biding its time, this curiously well arranged song flirts on and off with Katatonia's slow-cooking electronic proclivities, oppressive groove riffs and downbeat, ghostly urban vibes, leading up to (and creating the right atmosphere for) a sorrowful chorus which gets the job done without fuss, bells or whistles. Faithful to that climate, Anders weaves a short tale of solitude and aging which feels, contrary to the rest of this album's cut-and-dried approach, oddly sincere and elegant in its restraint. Now, contrast that to the glossy, faux-aggressive messes of \"Save Me\", \"Through My Eyes\", \"The Truth\", \"The End\" or \"Here Until Forever\", all complete with a shriekfest of a vocal performance enhanced by wonky effects like clapping, a kid's choir (thanks, Evergrey) and, shock of all shocks, not a whole lot of metal. \n\nAll in all, \"Battles\" is another misfire from a band that has thoroughly repackaged itself, despite lacking the honesty to just get rid of the trappings which it once helped popularize, instead choosing to walk around wearing them as a rotting second skin. Check it out for \"Wallflower\" or if you're craving nondescript alt-pop choruses. Also, Anders pronounces \"dark\" as \"dork\" somewhere, which never fails to be amusing and thus gets an extra 1%. Otherwise, skip this dud.\n",
        "\nThe Gothenburg sound. Swedish melodeath. This album defines and epitomizes both of these well-known terms in a way that no other record, sans perhaps \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d, can. The melodic death metal ground was fertile, with seeds having been laid by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames themselves with debut \u201cLunar Strain\u201d, and with \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d they hit the jackpot. Less intense than \u201cSotS\u201d and more harmonic than DT\u2019s \u201cThe Gallery\u201d, In Flames\u2019 sophomore effort is probably the most accessible and melodic album I still can bear to call a death metal record, and even that feels like a stretch. Amped up Iron Maiden-metal with twin guitars and growl vocals would be a more suitable description, but since this is what melodeath sounds like, let\u2019s adopt the moniker for this review.\n\nFirst and foremost: there are great hooks in every song. And I mean every. Fucking. Song. The melodies are all over the place, dragging you into the world of toe-tapping and off-key humming faster than you can say \u201cABBA!\u201d There are fast songs, mid-tempo songs and calmer songs, so even though everything is sugar-coated by guitar harmonies in layer upon layer, there\u2019s variation to be had. Effective breaks and tempo changes help to elevate the energy level when things get too repetitive, and the insertion of acoustic and clean guitars, so common to the genre, add a notch to the dynamic spectrum. The production is a fine testament of the Studio Fredman sound \u2013 everything is crisp and clear, with a reasonable punch and just a little hint of sharpness to the edges to avoid fluffy mushiness. Considering the probably ridiculous amount of guitar tracks used, it\u2019s incredible how well-balanced everything sounds, and that all details are easily discernible.\n\nThe real selling point of this album is of course the guitar work. Heavy and thrash metal-inspired riffs alternate with the sweetest and most innocent of melodies, that could as easily be inserted into a folk melody, a pop song, or on \u201cPowerslave\u201d. The aforementioned harmonies are almost omnipresent, further thickening the six-stringed wall, as well as honeying/lubing the listener\u2019s ear with bittersweet overtones that clash and caress each other like two lovers on the Reeperbahn. Why does all this overtly sweet stuff work so well in a metal context? The hooks, man, the hooks\u2026 The melodies are so catchy that even a lobotomy won\u2019t save you from them haunting your dreams. Rotting away in your grave, you\u2019ll still tap your toe to Dead Eternity, scaring the bajeezus out of the cemetery caretaker. Also, beautiful solo on December Flower by guest Fredrik Johansson (ex-Dimension Zero). The bass supports the guitars and nothing more. Nothing wrong with that, but nothing spectacular either.\n\nThe drums on \"The Jester Race\" are well-played, well-arranged, well-sounding\u2026and safe. Very safe. There are cool double kicks, faster two-beats and even blast beats in one song, as well as some nice tom rolls, but all in all there\u2019s not much that is special about the drumming on this record. It\u2019s all tight and fitting and nice etc, but nothing out of the ordinary. At the same time, had Dave Lombardo played on \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d, would it have been as good? I\u2019m thinking no, as his playing would probably have taken too much attention away from the selling point of the album, which is\u2026? The penis. Yes. Good dog. Here, have a boner.\n\nFrid\u00e9ns first recording with In Flames only shows one side of his vocal skill set, which has widened considerably during the last two decades. On \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d we get to hear his growl game, which is quite nice, but limited. Frid\u00e9n\u2019s growls are raspy and mid-to-high-pitched and he delivers the lyrics with poise and rhythmic pregnancy, but as they are quite one-dimensional they tend to get a bit monotone over the course of a whole album. The lyrics are half-mysterious and metaphor-heavy, the album\u2019s concept deals with the futile human race driving itself into extinction through ignorance, negligence and stupidity. Penned by Frid\u00e9n and Niklas Sundin (Dark Tranquillity), the lyrics have a magniloquent and bombastic, yet poetic aura, which was very \u201cin\u201d by the time:\n\nGaia impaled on their horns and lances\nto fumes from her body give case\nas the throng of blind mind savour the scent,\ndream-dead from prosaic and hate\n\nIn Flames\u2019 finest moment, in my opinion, was definitely the \u201cSubterranean\u201d EP that preceded this album, but this is surely their best full-length effort. It further cemented the Gothenburg sound as the prevalent genre in the mid-90\u2019s and lifted In Flames into the upper echelon of metal. If you\u2019re ever in need of all-you-can-eat riffs and melodies, this is the album to spin.\n",
        "\nIn Flames has always been a bit of an anomaly in the metal community. Not because they aren\u2019t well known or anything, they certainly are; they are often seen as a zit on the face of melodic death metal. We all know that these guys have released some of the genre\u2019s \u201cessentials\u201d such as \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d and \u201cWhoracle\u201d. These albums are testaments to the Gothenburg death metal movement and also to heavy metal as a whole. But what about \u201cColony\u201d? This album is often mentioned in circles surrounding the genre as well, and rightfully so. I\u2019ll say this is my favorite album from In Flames. It always has been and likely always will seeing as In Flames (in my opinion, as this certainly doesn\u2019t speak for the vast majority of people) hasn\u2019t had a decent album out since 2008. I mean \u201cSounds of a Playground Fading\u201d is alright but the last two albums are pretty sub-standard. Just wait, I\u2019ll eventually release my thoughts on that pop rock abortion that is \u201cBattles\u201d. But for now, let\u2019s discuss \u201cColony\u201d. Let\u2019s discuss an album that is seen as both a classic AND as an atrocity, or rather lackluster, by some. \n\nThis album has a bit more of a power metal aspect to it. Not in the vocals of course but in the style of the music itself. The guitars are far more melodic and some could even say epic. Not epic as in epic black metal or Blind Guardian or Symphony X style, but as far as In Flames goes, this is pretty, well\u2026epic. Some of the catchiest riffs these dudes have ever written are included right here on this album. Maybe that\u2019s why it became such an accessible listening experience. Nothing here is going to wow your musical imagination with algebraic complexity border lining on complex calculus, but that\u2019s okay. In Flames was never the band to really do that sort of thing even on these classic albums of the 1990s. Take \u201cEmbody the Invisible\u201d for example. This is the album\u2019s opening track. It begins with an insanely catchy riff that does rear it\u2019s lovely head in the song\u2019s concluding moments but it is so catchy, a pop punk band probably could have utilized it as well and no one would have given a gosh dang monkey crap. The solos on this album are prevalent and every song boasts a decent one but like I said, nothing too crazy really happens. \u201cOrdinary Story\u201d is probably the most recognizable song here and likewise has a music video to go with it. The solo in this song is amazing and proved that Jesper could write a great solo using simple methods. He certainly is missed. \u201cZombie Inc.\u201d is another favorite of mine and starts with a slower, yet EXTREMELY melodic riff. This riff is also used in the song\u2019s chorus. The songs all sound a bit similar to each other but with songs this well-crafted, why would that be a bad thing? Even the gorgeous acoustic interlude \u201cPallar Anders Visa\u201d is extremely effective as is the rerecording of the classic from \u201cLunar Strain\u201d, \u201cBehind Space\u201d. \n\nThere is not too much more to say about this album but here, Anders\u2019 vocals sound like a more expansive style he was using on the previous two albums, most notably \u201cWhoracle\u201d. He uses some \u201ccleans\u201d and spoken words such as on \u201cOrdinary Story\u201d again but not to the point he would eventually reach on \u201cClayman\u201d and unfortunately on \u201cReroute to Remain\u201d. His vocal style differs a bit from \u201cClayman\u201d (which would be released the following year, and of course usually is constituted as the band\u2019s last \u201crelevant\u201d album by a lot of people, myself not included) in that he doesn\u2019t use as many high screams. That would of course become his standard style of harsh vocals. The drumming is standard for In Flames. There are not that many blast beats, if any actually qualify as such, to be heard here. Just standard, groove-laden drumming. And this is okay with me.\n\nI\u2019m a bit shocked at how many of these reviews state this album simply as average. It really feels like so much more than just that to my ears. It had to be 8 or 9 years ago when I first heard this album and even to this day, it frequents my eardrums. It\u2019s not an absolutely perfect album but as far as In Flames goes, I still stay it\u2019s the cream of the crop.\n",
        "\nMaybe I'm going soft, but I actually kinda like Siren Charms. It isn't the most polished album and it certainly isn't one of the greatest albums of all time, but there's a charming quality about it that I can't help but appreciate. Melodeath it is not, and equally the intensity is pretty low. If that's what you're here for, obviously you're going to go away disappointed. However, I find quite a lot of this to be not only decent, but actually rather good.\n\nAnders gets a lot of flack for his vocals, and honestly I see where that comes from. His screams get worse with every new album and at best they can be described as an earsore. On a positive note though his cleans are not quite as bad, and even if they only raise the bar to 'meh' they do comprise at least half of the vocals on Siren Charms. That being said, he does have a few highlights, namely his duet with Emilia Feldt on 'When the World Explodes' and chorus of 'Rusted Nail'. The latter is a good example of the middle-ground between harsh and cleans that Anders occasionally puts to good use, but it's frustrating that ninety-nine per cent of the time he opts to go for either one extreme or the other rather than hitting that sweet spot that's actually enjoyable.\n\nSpeaking of Emilia Feldt, she's a great addition to In Flames in the same manner that Lisa Miskovsky was on the track 'Dead End' from Come Clarity. I don't know what it is about In Flames, but their music seems perfectly oriented to incorporate female vocalists. Emilia showcases so much talent on 'When the World Explodes' despite singing for less than half of the track's run-time, and again I have to ask why they made this a one-off. She's got an enormous range to her voice and a beautiful delicate tone to go with that, and actually Anders seems to play off of her quite well. Siren Charms could have been a very interesting album had Emilia featured on further tracks, but alas that's not the case.\n\nAs you might have come to expect from In Flames the riffs are largely bland and generic chugging. It's not particularly bad per se, just a little uninteresting. The leads show more enthusiasm, playing some reasonably technical sections and often injecting the energy into the music that seems to be missing from time to time. The melodic lines are more fragile than they used to be, but they're the one tangible sense of what In Flames used to be. The one track where they really seem to go all out is the previously mentioned 'Rusted Nail', which proves to be a highlight. The more alternative style of tracks like 'Dead Eyes' seems to be something that In Flames can pull off reasonably well however, and I'm not particularly gutted that they tend more towards that than the pseudo-melodeath offered on releases like Come Clarity. And at least the chug-laden sections tend to have a nice groove to them for the most part.\n\nAll in all I would say that this album isn't as bad as it's made it to be. It's far from fantastic, but 'When the World Explodes', 'Rusted Nail' and 'Dead Eyes' are all fairly strong tracks in their own right and the rest of Siren Charms, while never quite at the same standard, is overall a solid listen. I don't know that I'd recommend it past the three tracks I singled out, but it certainly isn't half as bad as the flack it receives would imply.\n",
        "\nIn Flames' ''8 Songs'' was given away in a beautiful jewel case with German Rock Hard magazine to promote the release of ''Sounds of a Playground Fading''. Aside of two tunes from the new studio album, this release includes four more studio tracks from very different eras of the band plus two rare audio recordings taken from the live DVD \"Used & Abused - In Live We Trust\". \n\nThis record doesn't only raise expectations from the new record which would turn out to be a highlight of the band's contemporary melodic alternative metal style but can also be seen as a perfect introduction to the band and a welcome alternative to a simple greatest hits record. The album features famous band classics like the hit anthem ''Only for the Weak'' which is absolutely mandatory in concert but also more obscure stuff like the underrated ''Soundtrack to Your Escape'' bonus track ''Discover Me Like Emptiness''. The songs vary from catchier tunes with electronic elements like ''Deliver Us'' to fast-paced and pitiless melodic death metal stompers like ''Enter Tragedy'' that prove how versatile the group is without losing its unique sound based upon a mixture of crunching riffs, melodic guitar solos and Anders Frid\u00e9n's perfectly imperfect and highly emotional vocals that sound like nothing else.\n\nMy final verdict is that this release is both a great addition to any collection of the band's inspired, extended and entirely entertaining discography and a perfect introduction to one of the metal scene's household names for younger or inexperienced listeners. You just can't go wrong with this release that only includes great to excellent songs from the early years through the middle years up to the then-new studio album in thirty-three concise and diverting minutes.\n",
        "\nSince 2002, In Flames have been pursuing what another reviewer referred to as \"emo-electronicore\" with only partial, and intermittent, success, with lots of duds littering their discography. Siren Charms represents a sort of \"softening up\" of the relatively poppy formula on Sounds of a Playground Fading, which itself only met intermittent success. \n\nI can appreciate the sound the band is emulating here, roughly an amalgamation of every late 90's, early 00's clich\u00e9 on the map, to be sure, but at least they're trying... I think? There is such an underwhelming diversity of content here, with what feels like only enough riffs for 3 or 4 songs, hence the title of the review. Too many chorii sound exactly the same, too much Anders warbling over identical verses results in the songs blending together and passing from memory. For instance, the aforementioned Dead Eyes could have been melded with With Eyes Wide Open, and the result would have been stronger material with less compromises. \n\nIt's like each song has one or two good things about it, and the rest is forgettable. At this point, the band is relatively tight and doing what they do, but it all feels underwhelming. Bj\u00f6rn's solos and riffs are relatively forgettable, the bass is buried and follows the guitars anyway, and the drums are kinda just there, Ringoing it up like crazy. \n\nA Sense of Purpose was actually somewhat decent, and it had everything this doesn't: riffs, solos, and more original ideas. The chorus of Rusted Nail illustrates this perfectly. Stock as fuck even for 1999, and this was made in 2014. The rest of the album doesn't fare much better. It's conceivable that this could be enjoyed as a throwback, \"gimmick\"-type albums if you dig JNCO jeans, spiked/bleached hair, and super angsty lyrics, but even then it has little shelf life.\n\nThere are stronger songs on here, but nothing approaches what would be considered \"good\". When the World Explodes is a good enough song compared to the rest with a rather atmospheric ending, and Everything's Gone is ok if for no other reason it's faster and more aggressive than the rest, even that's not saying much. In the case of Everything's Gone we also contend with extremely angsty lyrics as well as Through Oblivion, and on that song Anders Friden has never sounded so drugged out and lethargic. \n\nSpecial circles of hell, however, are reserved for Paralyzed, which is a mildly catchy but very stock chorus in search of a song. Literally everything about the song is annoying and trying too hard to Mtv. The title track, Siren Charms, is equally damnable for taking a similar riff as the sorry excuse for a main riff from Paralyzed, and made an entire song out of it, with that riff being damn near the only riff. Like holy shit this album is devoid of ideas.\n\nIn Flames have at best been an above average if not mediocre band to me, but this is terrible. There are so many recycled ideas and lazy execution. Perhaps the band is just done, creatively, at this point. Who knows? They surprised me with A Sense of Purpose. No reason to believe they won't again.\n",
        "\nThere are bands out there that change so much in their career they essentially abandon their original sound (Such as Opeth, Cynic, etc) but manage to craft a new sound for themselves that still shows their focus remains on the music. Opeth chose to go down a progressive rock path, embracing strange 70s retro modulation effects and delays that scream ELP, Pink Floyd and King Crimson. I personally don't care as much for their newer stuff, but will still admit they're not selling out by any means. Same situation with Cynic. They got tired of playing tech death metal, so they slowed down and softened the base of their music while still keeping their identity with the vocoders, scientific riffing and soloing.\n\nThat's not really the case with In Flames' new album.\n\nIf you're well acquainted with In Flames first 4 albums or so, you understand where they came from. They're one of the founding three bands of Swedish MDM. They helped pioneered the dual-guitar harmony structure of the genre itself, as well as some more intricate riffing than what Swedish bands had been doing up until then. \n\nSo, not knowing what their newer discography was supposed to sound like, I listened to \"The Truth\" seeing it was just released. All one can think about when being audiologically assaulted with that terrible \"we are, we aaare!\" is, \"WTF was that!? Was that an elementary school choir?\" Who does that? Put a little kid's choir into a metal song? It gets worse. They put it in THREE songs on this album. It makes you wonder if they put them in there to induce a listener's experience that mimics that of \"hipster douchebag\" pop music. You know, the kind that uses acoustic guitars, pianos, violins, and any other acoustic instrument they can get their hands on so it boosts their appeal to folk fans? Its called a \"gang-shout.\" It makes people want to sing along. In Flames never needed to do that before, fans seem to sing along despite not knowing what the vocalist is growling about. \n\nHow about the vocals? Anders Friden used to have a pretty awesome death growl back in the day that rivalled nobody. Now it just sounds like he's purposely trying to shred his vocal cords by attempting to sound like Dani from Cradle Of Filth. Or how about those cleans? They wouldn't suck so much if he didn't breathe so excessively like he's on the pot figuratively \"crapping\" out the new In Flames album. There's this line in \"The Truth\" that goes, \"Are you just gonna turn around and walk away?\" Listen to it. What the heck was that? An emo chick? Why the moody whimper? When is that ever appropriate for an amazing band like In Flames?\n\nThe production is the only thing that seems half-way decent about this album. Except for the mixing on \"Through My Eyes\", that guitar solo is WAY TOO LOUD. Turn down the wah-pedal there, it sounds like its stuck on the \"Kirk Hammett\" setting. Not a fan of the \"stuck wah\" sound that Bjorn is using for his leads.\n\nGeneral consensus is, it sucks. In almost every way. What the heck happened guys? They've adopted just about every facet of mainstreaminess they could find. \n\nSimplified and standardized song structure? Check.\nReplace death growls with breathy, whiny cleans and Dani Filth screams? Check.\nReplace good guitar tone with crappy \"stuck wah\" sound? Check.\nAdd in some children's choir to make it sound more friendly? Check.\nRemove double bass and blast beats? Check.\nAdd in dubstep noises into random parts of the song? Check.\n\nAt least this album is bad enough to make for a hilarious Christmas present. Right?\n",
        "\nEvery metalhead who has a bit of knowledge about what In Flames have done since the beginning of the new millennium can easily predict what this album is like. Although die hard In Flames fans still hope for a return to good old days, this seems unlikely. After the heart of the band (guitarist Jesper Str\u00f6mblad) left in 2010, Swedish band delved into alternative metal territory with their 2011's album Sounds of a Playground Fading. The once innovative melodeath band used to be one of my personal favourites; unfortunately, the decline of a once great band is becoming clearer with each release. The newest output by Swedish band is nothing more than a continuation of a path the band took with two preceding releases.\n\nStarting off with Drained, a listener can found himself really surprised as the album opener differs from what In Flames accustomed us to. The song begins with a bleak melody, then whispering vocals come in. However, this is the only innovation I found in the opener; the rest of the song is a typical post-2000 In Flames song with a simple verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus structure. The chorus is weak and uninspired, during the verses a listener can have an impression of listening to a screamo band.\n\nThe opener is followed by perhaps the most known song on the album, a track called The End. It was released as a lead single prior to the album's release and received fairly lauding responses, it was even compared to older In Flames material due to its opening guitar riff. The song itself also marks an innovation in the new In Flames approach - appearance of children choir.\n\nThe band incorporated even greater usage of electronics than they did on previous albums, it's especially noticeable on the album's second single, The Truth. The track is probably the most radio friendly song In Flames have ever produced, with the prevalent presence of children choir in the chorus.\n\nHalfway through the album, a listener can feel a bit weary of all these flowery choruses and impeccable song production. That's it, my friends - every song on the album is structured in the same way I mentioned at the beginning of my review, a verse followed by a chorus. This is what they have been doing since 2002. In Flames obviously aren't the most creative band around, huh?\n\nEveryone wants In Flames to come back to their pre-Reroute to Remain sound, yet they firmly cling to their recent musical approach. With every album the expectations are growing - and in the end we get an album like Battles. On one hand it's laudable to do something irrespectively of the others, everyone has a right to pursue one's own ways but on the other hand - the way In Flames took is an easy way, a way of radio airplay and MTV auditions.\n\nThe separate paragraph should be devoted to vocals. Anders Frid\u00e9n is a substantial element of the album, similarly as on Siren Charms and Sounds of a Playground Fading, his vocals fluctuate between agonising screams and nasal clean vocals. However, one can easily notice the presence of harsh vocals has decreased considerably in comparison to their earlier releases. Frid\u00e9n's vocal lines are often cheesy along with his lyrics.\n\n\"I'm taking more than I can give\nIs this the life I wanna live?\" he sings on Underneath My Skin and it leaves me wondering whether I'm listening to a metal band or some kind of a pop-punk group. \n\nTo sum up, the band's twelfth studio album is almost a twin brother of 2014's Siren Charms, however, the latter was performed in a more aggressive approach. After comparing those two releases I can come up with a conclusion that Battles is a slightly worse album than its predecessor and probably the worst output of the band in their entire career. There are little to no redeeming features here. I'd rather be listening to The Jester Race instead.\n\nFavourite (actually decent) tracks: The End, Like Sand, Wallflower\n\nLeast favourite tracks: The Truth, In My Room, Before I Fall, Drained\n",
        "\nIn Flames is without a doubt one of the most controversially discussed metal bands. The Swedish quintet has changed, fine-tuned and progressed its sound on each studio record and shifted away from melodic death metal to electronic alternative rock over the years. While many traditionalists see the band as traitors who are trying to be commercially successful by any means necessary, the group is still playing sold-out shows in front of several thousands of old and new fans alike. I have been a fan of all phases this band has gone through and thoroughly enjoyed each of the last three albums because they had consequent, diversified and energizing tracks that always offered something new.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the case on the band\u2019s latest record Battles. It\u2019s not a bad album by any means and on a purely subjective level I listen to this record quite regularly. From a more honest and objective point of view, one must admit that the band offers quantity instead of quality on Battles. Among the fourteen new tracks, only about half of them manage to stick out and offer something interesting. The other half is solid but ultimately exchangeable and repetitive at times. The band offers catchy electronic alternative rock with minor melodic death metal elements but a true evolution compared to the last effort that felt more courageous is missing here.\n\nThe band convinces during its more concise tunes. The single \u2018\u2019The Truth\u2019\u2019 was controversially discussed because it is dominated by simple guitar riffs, rhythmic electronic elements that are almost danceable and a catchy and mellow chorus you won\u2019t get out of your mind. The saccharine clean vocals and the juvenile anthemic backing vocals only add to the controversy. I really like this song because even experienced alternative rock and pop bands don\u2019t come around with such a precise, melodic and addicting track all the time. The lyrics are also quite interesting and the lines \u2018\u2019We are the truth that hurts the most; it hurts when your denial\u2019s exposed\u2019\u2019 might as well be addressed to the closed-minded traditionalists that have kept criticizing the group in a most nonconstructive way for far over one and a half decades by now. It fits that this message is delivered in the band\u2019s most commercial track ever and that this song has been chosen as a single. This earworm is one of the few moments on the album where the band really takes some risks. Another great track is the other single \u2018\u2019The End\u2019\u2019 that convinces with a balanced mixture of a harsh vocals recalling the band\u2019s roots, a melodic pre-chorus in the key of the group\u2019s more recent material and a powerful chorus supported by a children\u2019s choir that offers something completely new.\n\nThis album also offers several songs where the band either rehashes ideas that have worked better in the past or where the group experiments in an unsuccessful way. An example for the first category is the uninspired power ballad \u2018\u2019Here Until Forever\u2019\u2019 that reminds of several mellower tracks on the last studio effort with calm verses and emotional choruses. This song doesn\u2019t have the uplifting lyrics of \u2018\u2019Dead Eyes\u2019\u2019 or the emotionality of \u2018\u2019Paralyzed\u2019\u2019 though and sounds more like a pop punk ballad that could have been released by Blink-182 or Good Charlotte one and a half decades ago. The chugging \u2018\u2019Wallflower\u2019\u2019 falls into the second category with its overlong build-up and a total length above seven minutes. While previous epic tracks of the band such as the menacing \u2018\u2019Your Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone\u2019\u2019 or the emotionally driven \u2018\u2019The Chosen Pessimist\u2019\u2019 had a clear evolution from start to finish, \u2018\u2019Wallflower\u2019\u2019 disappoints with simplistic riffs, uninspired electronic background sounds, vocals that are more breathed than sung and weird atmospheric breaks that break the flow over and over again. All those elements are never going anywhere and dragging on for far too long.\n\nThe main difference between Battles and Siren Charms is that the predecessor sounded dark, mysterious and pressured at times while the new album is more catchy, melodic and uplifting. One reason for this might be that the new album was recorded in California while the predecessor was made in Berlin. Since I usually prefer albums that are a rather dark, experimental and profound over more positive, traditional and repetitive efforts, it might not come as a surprise that I prefer Siren Charms over Battles.\n\nIn the end, Battles is a good alternative rock record but only an average release in In Flames\u2019 varied discography. Aside of this record\u2019s more uplifting atmosphere, the band fails to explore new territories or to deliver a consistent return to something it had explored before in the different individual tunes. Overall, the record sounds like a mellower version of the group\u2019s previous five studio outputs. Faithful fans should purchase the record while occasional fans can skip it without any regrets and traditional fans will still be stuck in the past and blindly despise the group\u2019s new style anyway.\n",
        "\nIn Flames were once the innovators of melodic death metal. No In Flames means no celebrated metalcore bands around today. After releasing their first album in 1994, they then proceeded to release 5 genre-defining albums, 4 of which are universally considered classics. Established as a force to be reckoned with, they then released \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d in 2002, but it differed from their trademark Gothenburg Metal and introduced cleaner vocals and more accessible harmonies. To most of their fans, this was a fantastic album and took the band to the peak of popularity; others feared they would never again hear an album in league with the 4 preceding classics.\n\nNow in 2016, we have observed In Flames spending more time abandoning their melodic death metal than they have producing it. We could forgive them in 2011 when they released \u201cSounds of a Playground Fading\u201d because, even as middling as it was, it was still better than In Flames\u2019 first proper misfire: \u201cA Sense of Purpose\u201d. However, few could defend what followed in 2014: \u201cSiren Charms\u201d sounded like In Flames were a different band. Gone were the growls -- and the notion of any form of death metal was just a dream. Nowadays, the flames are naught but embers. Their growing radio-friendly accessibility is no longer a joking matter: \u201cBattles\u201d is marked as the album that decides the ultimate fate of In Flames.\n\nIt\u2019s great for bands to evolve their sound, but it generally helps if the change is actually advantageous. Kudos to In Flames for progressing their sound, rather than engage autopilot, but it truly has not worked out well. While listening to tracks such as \u2018Drained\u2019, \u2018The Truth\u2019, \u2018Save Me\u2019 and the sickeningly cheesy ballad, \u2018Here Until Forever\u2019, one must wonder what the band were honestly hoping to achieve after creating such mediocre songs. Each of these tracks features insipid riffs and inept techno elements that bring absolutely no sense of rejuvenation to the band\u2019s newer direction. During \u2018Like Sand\u2019, Anders Frid\u00e9n repeats: \u201cI believe the whole wide world is against me\u201d. With equally infantile lyrics scattered throughout Battles, they are against you Anders, they really are.\n\nFrid\u00e9n\u2019s presence over Battles is substantial. He\u2019s always had a subdued singing approach, but there\u2019s a difference between sounding subdued and strained. There are a few moments on Battles where his vocals don\u2019t sound as sore. The title track is notably heavier with a sweeping chorus and \u2018Through My Eyes\u2019 evokes a negligible return to 2006\u2019s \u201cCome Clarity\u201d. And yet, the issue with these better moments is that they just sound tediously safe in contrast to what we know the band is truly capable of.\n\nWhatever battle In Flames have been fighting, Battles signifies the resounding sense of defeat. The guitar work is so far beneath the level that was set a decade ago (let alone two decades ago), the singing and lyricism have never sounded so angst and segments of the album sound like they were recorded underwater. The worst factor: it\u2019s not even an album that you can grow into and appreciate. \n\nHow veteran musicians like In Flames appear so blind to their own devolution is tragically bewildering.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/72177/In-Flames-Battles/\n",
        "\nA few days ago, I had a rather interesting discussion with my father. It wasn\u2019t even about In Flames\u2019 live record but about the upcoming live album of the medieval folk metal group In Extremo. The band is going to release a live album of a concert my parents had attended in Cologne a few weeks ago. When I realized that the band had chosen to only put seventeen out of the twenty-four tracks played in show on the new album, I told my father that it was regrettable that the bad wouldn\u2019t release a double-album with the entire set. My father\u2019s reaction surprised me quite a lot: \u2018\u2019They only cut the old classics from the upcoming release that are already included on numerous live records anyway. Who needs the same songs over and over again? That would be nonsense!\u2019\u2019 He supported the band\u2019s decision to focus on its more contemporary tracks and said that only idiots with too much money on their hands would buy another release with similar track and set lists to those that have already been produced in the past. I have given this some thought and in the end, I realized that he was absolutely right about this. I already own all the band\u2019s live albums and I\u2019m glad the band focuses on new material that has never been played before and since the previous releases included entire concerts with lengths around or even above two hours, I don\u2019t mind having a more concise version around seventy-five minutes this time around.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the new In Flames live album, you might rightfully ask. It\u2019s quite simple. The band chose to release a rather short and intense concert that lasts less than one and a half hours and which almost exclusively focuses on the band\u2019s last few studio outputs. The numerous old-school fans complaining about the set list and the fact that several classics from the early years aren\u2019t included here simply don\u2019t have a point and should listen to the band\u2019s previous live outputs such as \u2018\u2019The Tokyo Showdown \u2013 Live in Japan 2000\u2019\u2019 released fifteen years earlier.\n\nThe band\u2019s new live release will obviously please to those who appreciate the group\u2019s last few records. If we take a look at the unchained crowd in a packed concert hall in Gothenburg with a capacity of about fourteen thousand people, this doesn\u2019t seem to be a minority. The fans are banging their heads, cheering loudly, clapping their hands, jumping around, singing along and starting mosh and circle pits. The band on the other side is giving both an energetic and energizing performance, offers a great light show with some visual effects and communicates well with the fans without talking too much and losing any momentum. Just like on the band\u2019s previous live record \u2018\u2019Used and Abused \u2013 In Live We Trust\u2019\u2019 eleven years earlier, it\u2019s a little bit sad that these interactions are obviously all made in Swedish and that international fans won\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on. On the other side, this home game transmits such a great atmosphere that I don\u2019t mind the occasional short dialogue in Swedish. It\u2019s not comparable to HammerFall\u2019s live album \u2018\u2019One Crimson Night\u2019\u2019 for example, where the band would communicate in Swedish with the fans for several minutes and completely lose my interest at times.\n\nThe tracks from the band\u2019s previous studio album Siren Charms work surprisingly well in concert and are sometimes even better live than in studio. I always thought that the complex \u2018\u2019In Plain View\u2019\u2019 wasn\u2019t the best choice to open an album but the track builds up a tense atmosphere right from the start in concert and the crowd is immediately into it. \u2018\u2019Everything\u2019s Gone\u2019\u2019 turns out being a sinister tune that sounds more like a contemporary extreme metal song in concert than the Marilyn Manson clone it appeared to be on the studio album. One song that must be pointed out is \u2018\u2019When the World Explodes\u2019\u2019 that was among the more unspectacular tunes on the last studio effort but turns out being one of the highlights on this live record. The band invited Swedish soprano opera singer Emilia Feldt to perform the song she had recorded with the band two years ago in concert again and the chemistry between the unique Anders Frid\u00e9n and her works much better in concert than on the studio version. Emilia Feldt\u2019s emotional and skilled performance is adding a magic and psychedelic note to the live show and the beautiful artist has a very charming stage presence as well. This new live release shows additional qualities of the songs from the band\u2019s last studio effort and proves its legitimacy and legacy.\n\nAmong the songs which aren\u2019t taken from the last studio effort, one has to point out the band\u2019s diversified, emotional and hypnotizing performance of \u2018\u2019The Chose Pessimist\u2019\u2019. I can understand when people claim that the song sounds whiny, overlong and mellow but I\u2019ve always appreciated this unusual tune for these qualities. It\u2019s a courageous experiment that sounds very different from anything else In Flames has ever released which is quite meaningful since the band keeps experimenting and shifting its style while always sounding like itself. In this live version, the tension of the track is build up very carefully and the dragging tune slowly quickens up the pace before it explodes with a firework of emotional intensity. Anders Frid\u00e9n\u2019s perfectly imperfect work in this track and he really sings his heart and soul out in the final part of the track which gets me every time I listen to it. I\u2019m a rather emotional person myself, so this might explain my appreciation for this particular song.\n\nIn the end, \u2018\u2019Sounds from the Heart of Gothenburg\u2019\u2019 is almost like a greatest hits release that brings to the point everything In Flames represents nowadays and perfectly summarizes the path this band has taken for the last fifteen years of its career. Those who are still stuck in the band\u2019s first ten years of existence might reject this record but those who have appreciated the majority of the band\u2019s career will see this as a highlight in its extensive discography. In my opinion, the band\u2019s emotional, powerful and varied concert proves why this group is much more relevant than several comparable bands like Dark Tranquillity and Soilwork that keep releasing the same type of music in lesser quality over and over again. In Flames we trust.\n",
        "\nIn Flames' most recent abortion (as of writing this that is, they're going to be spewing forth another festering load soon) is exactly the same as just about everything else this band has done since 2002. The problem isn't even that they're playing this alternative metal stuff anymore, it's that they suck even at that. Compared to this band's closest living stylistic relative Soilwork, this pales in comparison to their output. The riffs are slovenly or non-existent, alternating between lazy alt rock picking and muddy, unmemorable grooves that predictably go nowhere and don't drive the songs at all. The drumming is similarly boring and lifeless, and the keyboards slather on a bunch of forgettable electronic bits nicked straight from a Depeche Mode release. Neither the music nor the vocals really gel with the keys though, with both of them being too upfront to let them a bit more. As stated, the issue isn't the musical techniques at work but how poorly they're executed and implemented, because Soilwork can craft a memorable tune with these very same ideas.\n\nThe songs, as ever, cycle between the verse and hook with all the predictability of a clock. The music never challenges you at all, it simply sits there and screams about its woes in a manner so pedestrian that not even the edgiest of teenagers could ever slit their wrists to it. Throughout the album there is a general sentiment of being irritated. Not overly sad and depressed, not immensely angry, not overly joyful, just mildly annoyed. I can't even tell you how unpleasant it is listening to Anders bitch and moan for 45 minutes over the lamest of alt-rock background music. His voice is bad by the standards of the genre, having cleans with literally no power to them at all. This is a problem because the songs are clearly geared toward sing-a-long clean hooks but his stomachache cleans are so unappealing that almost no one would want to sing to them at all. The decayed, bitchy half-screams are really weak, much weaker than even the likes of Howard Jones or Bj\u00f6rn Strid, and are completely unpleasant to listen to. A vocalist with so little gusto behind his performance cuts this album off at the knees, honestly, because for such a vocally orientated effort the 'main attraction' so to speak is dreadful.\n\nI don't get how anyone can like this, it is objectively an awful album. It is musically bland and lazy, but the vocals are so terrible and weak that you have to focus on the music. It is nowhere near passionate enough in its delivery to appeal to the snivelling 14 year old scenesters out there, any number of metalcore and nu metal bands do a better job of it than this. The atmosphere is unpleasant and not worth exploring in the first place and it isn't even well produced, boasting a grunge meets mallcore guitar tone that's too loud, vocals that are even louder and dated electronic keys.\n\nJust listen to Soilwork for fuck's sake, they do this style of angsty melogroove much better. I'd write more but the music is so shallow and lazy that there's nothing else to talk about.\n",
        "\nIt was 2009 when I first heard \"A Sense of Purpose\" by In Flames for the first time, so really, this album was new when I discovered it. I had actually only recently gotten into this band upon hearing this for the first time. This is probably the second best thing In Flames have done since they really changed their sound after \"Clayman\". I'd still consider their best post-2000 effort to be \"Come Clarity\" but this really is not all that far behind it. A nice slab of modern metal, this album has garnered quite a bit of praise but more discontent than anything, which is to be expected.\n\n\"The Mirror's Truth\" is the album's lead single and really works its radio accessibility and catchiness. It becomes clear that this album won't contain In Flames' melodic death metal sound of old but that really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, seeing as they pretty much dropped that with \"Reroute to Remain\" about 6 years ago at the time of this album's release in 2008. There are some solos in songs like \"Sleepless Again\" and \"Move Through Me\" but they aren't that impressive and really aren't worth mentioning. This album is more focused on groove, catchiness, and a fairly \"poppy\" sounding melodic tone. The guitars follow generally similar ideas throughout most of the songs while still succeeding in not sounding recycled or tired. \"I'm the Highway\" is one of the album's faster songs, if not the fastest. Even so, it manages to not sound aggressive whatsoever. The chorus of this song contains thrashy drumming and a faster riff but still sounds, well, tame. The same could be said about \"March to the Shore\", specifically the intro. This album is notable for containing the longest song In Flames have recorded yet. \"The Chosen Pessimist\" clocks in at 8 minutes and 15 seconds. This song relies on a simple riff that builds up throughout this song's nearly 2 and a half minute long intro, backed up with some bluesy guitar notes for added melody and ambiance. This song feels progressive in nature but doesn't do anything too technical. Instead, it relies on the build up and atmosphere. This song goes from quiet and peaceful to really epic with the synth-injected outro. This is, in my opinion, one of the best songs In Flames ever made, and the strongest track on the album.\n\nAnders' clean vocals seemed to improve with this release. This is a relief, because, for the most part, this is the style of vocal work he is using. He does still use his screams fairly often but he always seems to go back to his clean vocals. Really, he often manages to mix his screams and cleans together at the same time. You can hear the harshness in his voice but the lyrics are clear and easily understood. At times, his vocals do sound a be melodramatic and even borderline \"emo\". I do prefer the style he used on the older albums but at the same time, if he used that vocal style with the musical style on this album, I don't know how well it would work out. I guess I'm so used to this style with the modern In Flames stuff. The vocals in \"The Chosen Pessimist\" are pretty much completely clean and almost sound funny at times because let's face it, Anders is not that great a singer. He never has been although he has improved over the years. This does cause a bit of alienation throughout the album but really, it doesn't ruin or distract from the music too much. \n\nThis album has a crystal clear production and a very polished radio sheen. All of the instruments are heard clearly and do not overpower each other. Everything is mixed to the highest of quality. This is not a bad thing but it takes away from the music ever so slightly and makes everything sound a bit less organic. I'd consider this to be my second favorite album from In Flames post-\"Clayman\", which I noted in the first paragraph of this review. I'd order the \"modern\" In Flames album from best to worst as follows: \"Come Clarity\", \"A Sense of Purpose\", \"Reroute to Remain\", \"Sounds of a Playground Fading\", \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\", and \"Siren Charms\". This album wouldn't really be a good intro point for those who want to hear In Flames for the first time and are expecting melodic death metal but, for someone who like catchy, radio friendly rock/metal, this would be a good place to start.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the controversial \"Reroute to Remain\" in 2002 and the even more maligned \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\" in 2004, In Flames returned to the scene with \"Come Clarity\" in 2006. This album has had some of the most polarizing opinions within fan base of In Flames, as well as metal fans in general. For me, this album was my first taste of the band. Sitting in my eighth grade English class, I was recommended this band by a good friend. He also recommended the tracks \"Clayman\" and \"The Mirror's Truth\", the latter of which had only been out for a few months at that time. However, it wouldn't be until later that I heard those cuts, as after \"Come Clarity\", I listened to this band's discography entirely in order, from \"Lunar Strain\" and beyond. \"Come Clarity\" was an amazing experience for me. Even to this day, I can always go back to it and it manages to make me feel better when I need it the most.\n\nMusically speaking, within the time period of the \"modern\" albums from \"Reroute to Remain\" to \"Siren Charms\", \"Come Clarity\" probably is the closest representation to the band's melodic death metal sound of old. It basically contains 60% of the modern, more \"alternative\" sound that almost resembles melodic metalcore, and the 40% remaining is melodic death metal. This album still is often shunned by many of the band's \"old school\" fans but compared to any album after 2000, it seems to be the \"lesser of all the evils\". The guitars are extremely well played and effective throughout. The melodic riffs dance around a barrage of drums and a mixture of harsh and clean vocals quite nicely. The album's opener \"Take This Life\" is probably the biggest track on here in terms of popularity and is one of those songs that sounds more like In Flames' older stuff, while still retaining that modern sound. There is a cleanly sung chorus but the riffs are fairly typical of Gothenburg melodic death metal, and most of the song is still preformed with harsh vocals. All of these songs are insanely catchy but that really doesn't degrade the musical quality. \"Crawl Through Knives\" contains some of the best, most melodic yet still absolutely metal riffing on the album and a funny chorus to me, because when Anders says \"it's in my hands\", it actually sounds like he's saying \"it's in my ass\". This may appeal to the immature little kid within all of us. There are a lot of mellow moments on the album as well. The title track is basically a ballad with a very sad overtone that sounds absolutely wonderful, and the album's closing track \"Your Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone\" is mostly an electronically ambient piece until the distorted guitar comes in. This is also the longest song on here, running at 5 minutes in length. It's a really disturbing yet wonderful way to close the album.\n\nThe vocals are probably my least favorite aspect of the album, although they aren't even bad. When Anders using clean vocals more often with \"Reroute...\", his voice sounded painfully awkward and just not good. Here, his cleans still have a bit of an awkward sound, and this takes away from the experience a little bit in my opinion. Even though he still sounds uncomfortable here and out of place, his cleans have definitely improved. They would improve a bit more on the albums to come, although this album overall is much better than anything that would follow it. His harsh vocals are screams which sound like they have since \"Clayman\", as I feel that is the album where he really changed the pitch in his vocals. There aren't any death growls on here to point out, instead, just a common screaming technique used in most modern melodic death metal albums. The song \"Dead End\" contains vocals from the Swedish female pop singer Lisa Miskovsky and wow, she sounds amazing! I haven't listened to anything she has done outside of this collaboration with In Flames, but she really adds some depth to this duet. You can hear Anders and her intertwining in this song's chorus and it sounds so much better than it would have if Anders just took on the chorus himself. This helps the song not sound awkward. Even with some awkward sounding vocals, this doesn't take too much away from the album, even if it still derails it slightly. On the title track, Anders uses only clean vocals, and the sound still sounds solid overall.\n\nI'm aware this album still receives a lot of negativity from a lot of people, and that will likely never change. It is still the best album In Flames has done since 2000, with \"A Sense of Purpose\" probably being second and then everything else is somewhat of a hit or miss. Whenever I'm going through a dark period in my life, this album has been there to make me feel a little less like crap. Since 2008, \"Come Clarity\" has become a staple in my collection and I will always have it when I need it to be there for me.\n",
        "\nYeah, no. This is still modern In Flames we are dealing with here, as in, astonishingly shit metalcore/melogroove with some alt-rock and emo leanings here and there. Then again, this is by far the best of modern In Flames, and at times can challenge the likes of this band's mid-era. It is the usual, but with the occasional spark of brilliance that just comes out of nowhere. Certainly, it is a vast improvement over their absolute stinker of a turd pretending to be music that was Soundtrack to Your Escape. In fact, I think that album's very existence makes this sound that much better. So, congratulations In Flames... you still suck.\n\nMusically, this thing is bland but not *completely* worthless. The best way I can explain what happened here is akin to the change that occurred between Whoracle and Colony - the band ratcheted up the energy and aggression in the riffs by a fair margin, while still clearly being cut from the same cloth. This is quite similar, to be honest, being comprised mostly of nu 'metal' chunking, with a fair helping of grooves and alt rock picking sequences, all of which are so predictable that this album just becomes a walking clich\u00e9. What separates the guitar work from the previous album is that the grooves and chugging are a fair bit more driving and harder-edged than before, but of course the crappy picking comes in to ruin everything. To be honest, there still isn't much of worth in the musical department, but it is a relative improvement over the cluttering shit that came before. The rest of the instruments do their jobs well enough, if nothing else. Svensson mixes it up fairly often with his hammering, relatively fill-happy style, but even then a lot of his work is just boring timekeeping beats, and the bass fulfils its supporting role well enough, even if it does nothing else at all.\n\nSadly however, any sort of signs of life In Flames may show instrumentally is completely killed off by the hideous, vomit-inducing performance of my least favourite vocalist in the entire world, Anders Frid\u00e9n. Motherfucker grow some balls and stop doing these fucking fry screams will you?! He continues with his whiny, thin emo bitch screams that he has been using since Clayman, and are nearly as shite as they have been for the last two albums if not for the fact that the music underneath him is occasionally mildly interesting. \n\nThat said, his voice is almost tolerable and dare I say... appealing on a sort of angsty level during absolute melodeath scorchers like 'Take This Life' or 'Dead End' - the latter of which features some female guest vocals, which actually complement Anders well. Never thought you would hear me praise Frid\u00e9n's modern performances, huh? Don't worry; I haven't completely fallen off the deep end, because no amount of teen angst in the world will make me forgive his completely sappy clean vocals, which are just whiny, weak, near-tuneless and shit. His emo crooning is some of the worst in the business, and gives Jonathan Davis a run for his money in who can sound like a bigger pussy while 'singing'.\n\nThe end result of all of this is probably In Flames' least consistent album to date. On the one hand, you have modern melodeath trailblazers like the aforementioned tracks, as well as 'Versus Terminus' and most of 'Scream' and 'Vacuum'. These show the band under pressure, they show the band with rekindled fire and energy to make something solid and powerful. Anders' screams almost fit in here, as stated, and the urge to headbang is strong with these songs. However, not only are these songs the exceptions rather than the rule, but the remaining 7 songs (once one discounts the title track and closer) are extremely interchangeable. They are all about the same length, use pretty much identical verse-chorus structures, stick to predictable riff and picking patterns, all have similar ratios of clean/scream vocals, and generally have nothing to define them, what with similar sounding riffs and all. Basically, the album has way too much filler for its own good, and with those songs, you have to listen to Anders' vocals due to the boring music, which makes them pure shite.\n\nAnd we haven't even got to the worst bits yet. Hints of the clean vocals are present throughout the album, especially during the clean choruses of 'Take This Life' and what not, and are very difficult to swallow when the music is good. So imagine for a moment, how bad a song would be when you have his clean vocals exposed? Sure enough, you get the absolutely revolting radio ballad that is the title track and the unbelievably overlong and boring closer 'Your Bedtime Story is blah blah blah'. There really are no words for just how completely awful and whiny these songs are, rivaling the likes of 'A Boy Brushed Red...' for some of the most awkward and cringeworthy attempts at atmosphere ever conceived by any artist ever. Holy shit do these songs suck! \n\nThe production is clean and loud, and the album has a pretty nice low end in addition to a hammering kit, and is a massive step up from the hideous electronic layering of the last album. However... the vocals are far too loud, because they are audible. Therefore, this production job is an absolute failure. For fuck's sake studio engineers, did none of you bastards even *listen* to the prick at the mic?! (Oh wait, the prick at the mic produced it, which explains a lot.) And that pretty much wraps it up for this album. Musically it is inconsistent, ranging from kinda bad to pretty fucking solid, and the vocals range from pretty much tolerable to pure, unadulterated faeces. It has a few pretty neat tracks with some occasional cringe-inducing cleans, but for the most part it is just generic modern fodder with a bad vocalist. My verdict? Not quite 'Fucking Avoid' but just a plain and simple AVOID.\n",
        "\n...and how\u2019s that? Because I heard this album on Youtube, of course. Many people consider this album In Flames\u2019 worst album. Well, I cannot claim so, since I have no intention of checking out Sounds of a Playground Fading and Siren Charms (I heard a few short sections of some of the songs, though), but I CAN say that Soundtrack to Your Escape is really awful.\n\nThe biggest problem for some people is the very fact that In Flames don\u2019t play melodic death metal here (and anymore, for that matter). What do they play, then? Well, how do I say this? Music here has much more in common with nu metal and really shitty metalcore than with melodic death metal. And there are some sections inspired by really bad industrial metal. In short, bullshit.\n\nInstrumentally, not much can be said. Guitars simply chug some regurgitated riffs and quasi-riffs most of the time, with a few worthless solos scattered across the album, bass cannot be heard, while the drums sound very artificial and unnatural. Sometimes you\u2019ll be wondering if Daniel Svensson even played the drums or even bothered to sit behind the kit or if one of the band members bought a rhythm machine. When the drums don\u2019t sound like something made on said rhythm machine, they can be compared to drums heard on St. Anger. And, just like on Reroute to Remain, there are many keyboard and electronic sections that serve no actual purpose aside from being annoying.\n\nWhen we talk about the vocals... oh, man, is Anders even trying to sound anywhere close to normal? Many reviewers have compared his moaning, and yes, it\u2019s more moaning and wailing than actual singing, to something Jonathan Davis from Korn would do. I understand why they think so, as their voices do sound similar, however, at least Jonathan has been doing that more or less since the start, while Anders adopted it after In Flames made a name for themselves. As for growling... what growling? I heard practically no growling and, no, I\u2019m not deaf. As for screaming, the less I say about it, the better, it\u2019s just that painful.\n\nLyrics are another problem. In Flames actually used to write lyrics based on actually interesting stuff like fantasy, science fiction and astronomy, but you will not get any of that here. Instead, you\u2019ll get angst, angst and, guess what, more angst. I mean, seriously, take Like You Better Dead. It actually has a line \u201cI can be as angry as I want to be.\u201d If you were to hear that line in real life, what would you do? Slap the person who says it? Someone should\u2019ve slapped the jerk whose idea it was to write it (most likely Anders). In fact, someone should\u2019ve slapped everyone in the band.\n\nProduction drags this album even more down. The band may have paid a lot of money to get this album (or turd) produced, but you know what? Many home-produced albums and demos sound better and more pleasant than this. So... what the fuck?! Where did the money go?! Obviously not on good mixing.\n\nBut you know what the biggest problem here is? There are actually some sections that could\u2019ve been used in a much, much better way. The opening riff to In Search of I (pretty dumb title, by the way), as well as the opening riff to Dial 595-Espace (huh?), show some resemblance to what In Flames used to play and someone else could\u2019ve made decent, if unspectacular songs on the basis on those riffs. Also, the last fifty or so seconds in My Sweet Shadow, while objectively speaking crappy, are the best part of the songs, mostly because Anders doesn\u2019t scream and wail over it, and could\u2019ve been used more effectively nonetheless. Unfortunately, they're like some food you can eat, but not enjoy all that much... now imagine said food being dipped in dung.\n\nYeah, I know, there are albums that suck even more than this album, but that\u2019s not much of a consolation, is it? It\u2019s just sad that In Flames, one of pioneers of melodic death metal, ditched the very genre they helped create. Even worse is the fact that they\u2019ll likely never return to playing what they used to. Avoiding this piece of shit is a good idea. If you want nu metal (I know I don\u2019t want it), just get an actual nu metal album. If you want melodic death metal, stick to early material of In Flames or give Frozen Realm\u2019s self-titled EP a few spins.\n",
        "\nFollowing the release of the underrated melodic death/folk metal affair that was \"Lunar Strain\" and the EP \"Subterranean\", In Flames returned with \"The Jester Race\", which is often cited as their magnum opus. Released in 1996, this album was, and still is, an essential within the Gothenburg melodic death metal scene. This album is considered among the \"big three\" in the genre, along with Dark Tranquillity's \"The Gallery\" and At the Gates' \"Slaughter of the Soul\". There is that group of people who blame these releases for the eventual birth of metalcore and while these releases may have influenced that style of music, they are definitely pieces of revolutionary art. In Flames was the first melodic death metal band I heard, although I got into them through \"Come Clarity\". After that, I began listening to their entire discography in order. So in actuality, \"The Jester Race\" was the third album I heard from these dudes. I was probably 14 years old at this time and to me, this was some of the most extreme music I had heard, at that point in time of course. Looking back, this is definitely not my favorite In Flames album, as that title goes to \"Colony\". However, it is still a great album and I have always found myself coming back to it over and over again.\n\nBeginning with the acoustic introduction to \"Moonshield\", this album gives the listener a foreshadowing of what's to come. Beautiful melodies, accompanied with distorted electric guitar and Anders Frid\u00e9n's harsh vocals. This is definitely a metal album, no doubt about that. Musically speaking, it is similar in melody and structure to bands such as Iron Maiden or Judas Priest. However, the death metal influence lies within the vocals. There is a lot of controversy with this band due to their melodic take on death metal and a lot of death metal purists are quick to show discontent with In Flames, and any of the other \"melodeath\" bands for that matter. However, they inject a vast amount of melody and acoustic beauty into this extreme style of metal, and it works quite well. I'm sure if In Flames didn't go down the alternative \"modern\" metal style that they began with \"Reroute to Remain\" six years later, they wouldn't be shunned nearly as much. I'm not going to write a review berating anything In Flames has done in the past 14 years or so, but this is definitely different from anything post-2000. Harsher tracks such as \"Artifacts of the Black Rain\" and \"Lord Hypnos\" still contain tons of melody and are instantly recognizable classics. \n\nThis album clocks in at 40 minutes long and none of the songs go over the 5-minute mark, with \"Dead Eternity\" being the longest clocking in at just slightly over 5 minutes. In Flames have never been a band to write long, progressive pieces, and they've always been effective with average song lengths. This band gets their message across in a swift manner, but I'm almost always left underwhelmed in this aspect. Why? Simply because they easily could have added a few more minutes to some of these songs and the album would have been much better at 45 or 50 minutes, in my opinion. \"Artifacts of the Black Rain\" is probably the biggest offender of this, as it is one of the album's strongest tracks, but is sadly a bit too short in my opinion, at only slightly over 3 minutes. \n\nVocally, this is probably Frid\u00e9n's greatest performance of the band's entire career. There is no clean singing anywhere on here, just angry, pissed off death metal growls and grunts. The album's title-track is probably my favorite vocally on the album. You can really feel his energy all over the place. On later albums, he began using clean vocals, which eventually improved in skill. However, it's nice to just hear solid, extreme vocals without being interrupted by clean singing. In Flames was certainly not trying to land any radio airplay here.\n\nSo, while this is not my favorite album from In Flames, it is certainly in my top three. I don't resent these guys for changing their sound, as bands evolve. However, one cannot deny the impact, legacy, and overall importance of \"The Jester Race\".\n",
        "\nIn Flames are a band that I've steered clear of for the most part despite my love of melodeath. I've been particularly careful to avoid their later works, which some metalheads will have you believe are the among the worst offences any band has ever committed. However, when listening to a random playlist the track 'Dead End' came on and instantly caught my attention. I figured that the rest of the album was at least worth a listen, and to be fair there are some good tracks on Come Clarity. However, to say it is any better than mediocre would be a lie.\n\nLet's start with the good. 'Dead End' is the track that got me to listen to the entire album several times, so we'll begin with that. It's perhaps less melodeath than I would have thought I'd get from In Flames, but it's catchy and I find it really sticks in my head. Lisa Miskovsky's vocals help a lot in that respect, and as I'm a sucker for some good female vocals I find myself hooked by Lisa's voice. She fits in really well with the band actually, and it's sort of a shame that she's never worked with the band since. I don't quite find Anders as convincing, as his harsh shrieks aren't entirely to my tastes. However, 'Dead End' is certainly not the track that he performs worst on.\n\nBesides this track, 'Come Clarity' and 'Crawl Through Knives' are the best cuts from the album. Both of these tracks feature the same kind of catchy chorus that was present on 'Dead End', and it would seem that the band are oriented towards writing music in a metalcore influenced style. The melodic sections are limited mostly to these choruses, and the rest of the time the music consists largely of chugging riffs that have little to no impact. There's usually a solo (or an attempt at one anyway) in each song, but most of them are far from convincing either. To be honest, I'm really struggling to think of many positive points for this album beyond the aforementioned choruses, and at least as far as the guitar is concerned that's the only time there's any kind of thought put into the music. Because the guitars do nothing other than chug away for a good 70% of this album the drummer seems to think he should do the same thing and insists on hammering away with the double bass and cymbal crashes in an equally amateur and uncoordinated way. It makes it all sound like one horrible mess, and several tracks become a pain to listen to.\n\nAs well as his crappy screams, Anders does offer some clean vocals. To be frank they would have to be pretty bad to be more of an irritation than his harsh vocals, and in truth his singing is okay. Not great, but at least okay. They're tinged with metalcore like the rest of the band's work across Come Clarity, but I think that actually works to Anders' advantage. They're particularly good on 'Crawl Through Knives'.\n\nI would say quite simply to sum it up that this album does have some good moments, and the tracks that I've mentioned are worth listening to if you like modern melodeath. However, for the rest of the album In Flames are unable to find the same quality of song writing and it's mostly forgettable. Come Clarity is aimed more at the metalcore market than the melodeath scene that In Flames helped to create and so perhaps it's not entirely my cup of tea, but that doesn't excuse the lazy repeated patterns of chugs that comprise this album and lack of any kind of inspiration for at least half of this album.\n",
        "\n(Before I begin; a redaction must be made. I no longer consider Sounds of a Playground Fading to be the worst In Flames album, merely the second worst. For reasons I shall get into, that crowning title now belongs to this release).\n\nWhat is the meaning of life? What is our purpose on Earth? This may sound utterly hyperbolic but I really, honestly pondered this for several days after listening to this, and have come to one conclusion: If people make livelihoods out of producing albums like this, out of spending months writing, recording and producing things like this, with all the touring and admin alongside it... then life is worthless.\n\nThis is In Flames' 7th album, their second 'new' album, and the 3rd, most egregious of my 'unholy trinity of 2004'. Forget The End of Heartache (the 1st of the trinity), that has more balls than this. Forget Age of Winters, for boring and banal is still better than this. And yes, even forget They're Only Chasing Safety (the 2nd of the trinity), for that fully embraced its true emo self. I have said this about 2 albums now (the latter 2 of the ones I just listed), but let me promise you that this isn't merely an initial knee-jerk reaction to hipsters misappropriating metal or generic emo garbage. No, I fucking mean it this time. What we have here is THE WORST ALBUM I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO, PERIOD. I will never, ever back down from this statement, my fellow metalheads. And that is a promise.\n\nNow, you may be saying to yourself 'Oh dear, here we go again. Napalm is going to tear some generic mainstream groove rock a new one' or 'Dude calm down. How could this possibly be that bad? It is just bad alt rock, that is all'. Understandable sentiments, but this album is everything, and I repeat, EVERYTHING I hate in my music. All the qualities I have complained about in the past, everything that drives me up the motherfucking wall, it is all here.\n\nFirstly, there is the goddamn principle behind the style at work here. 'Selling out' doesn't irk me in the slightest, as long as the end product is good. I know why In Flames did it, and that is because Whoracle, Colony and Clayman are literally the same fucking album, stylistically. Reroute to Remain would have been a breath of fresh air, if not for the fact that it sucked major league balls by converting the heavy/power metal with harsh vocals of old into a really shit form of melodic groove metal with alt rock influences. Even then though, that album still contained sparks of the metal spirit, of conviction, of genuine inspiration. It may have sucked, but the fire was there. It was a clean evolution from the surprisingly electronically laced and commercially oriented Clayman.\n\nHere though? They have completely whored themselves out artistically. They have taken the formula of Reroute to Remain and added the trends of the time to it. They took an admittedly original idea and bastardised it further, merging it with the 'industrial gothic nu 'metal'' of the day to form... this. This artless, gutless, soulless turd of an album. And then, because of course they did, they had the bare faced CHEEK to add in melodeath influences of old through a few more guitar lines and melodic riffing. The result is a sell-out of the worst variety. Taking an original idea, and trading in any and all inspiration, creativity and passion for radio time and selling out venues in record time, and then trying to do some sort of quarter-assed 'return to form' from a somewhat bold statement with an outer coating of 'classic influences', despite the fact that this is meant to be moving further away from their roots than the fragmented Reroute to Remain. They can't even stand by their decision to become mainstream staples, and insist on retaining those 'death metal influences'. FUCK this album, and FUCK THIS BAND.\n\n\nAnd with that 600 word rant out of the way, let us actually talk about the music, huh?\n\n\nSo yeah, this is absolutely fucking terrible. Every last auditory facet of this sucks something unspeakably awful, so let us begin with addressing the most immediately offensive and concerning element of the lot. Anders. Dude. Do us all a favour will ya? Ready? Good.\n\nSTAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THIS BAND, ANY BAND, A STUDIO OR A MICROPHONE. JUST SHUT. THE FUCK. UP.\n\nSeriously, Anders was never a good vocalist (in fact, he is legendary for sucking) but never have I heard such a pitiful performance from anyone with any relation to metal. He uses his now infamous 'fry screams', which for those that don't know, are like the whiniest, most high pitched of emo screams, only... the same. They are so utterly hideous and grating, and it is only exacerbated by another 'great' idea this band pioneered, which is sounding out harsh vocals as though they are cleans. Rather than turning them into indecipherable ranting, Anders holds the syllables of each word (perhaps so the kiddies can understand them and sing along at concerts) and further extends the auditory violation that listeners must suffer. In short, the vocals suck. Hard.\n\nAnd that is before we even get to the instruments. As you may have guessed, they really are fucking shite. They are some of the most boring, emaciated and passionless instrumentals I have ever heard, and serve only to be noise, in order to sound 'extreme' and edgy. Either that, or they are a background drone for Anders to scream forth his declarations of teen angst (I will get back to those... ugh), or to prevent his voice from becoming to exposed and too grating for anyone to bare. The guitars merely shuffle and bumble along with repetitive 3 note grooves and one note nu 'metal' chugging, as well as occasionally throwing in a few melodic lines in an attempt to cling to the past (ugh... no. No more.), and little else. The drums and bass just follow the rhythm of the guitars - this just reeks of making noise for the sake of making noise. No inspiration, no atmosphere, no creativity, let\u2019s just make some headbanging (or hardcore dancing, in the case of this) with zero conviction or intelligence. \n\nAnd then we get to the songwriting. These songs go NOWHERE. They just enter and exit with zero justification or progression. Beginnings and endings are not pronounced in anyway. The 'riffs' are repeated over and over with no end in sight. Every song is structured the same, verse-chorus bullshit. Everyone just pounds away with little regard for the flow of the song or where they are going, and the end result is 12 pieced together identical eldritch abominations that go around in circles. This shit is so unfocused that any less focus would cause the album to play backwards. I know that makes no fucking sense, but neither does the existence of this turd.\n\nThe production is beyond abysmal. In fact, this is the worst production I have ever heard on a major (by metal standards) label, barring bullshit like Death Magnetic of course. Everything is electronically filtered and layered about 500,000 times in an attempt to inject some life into them through loudness. This can work, but it doesn't here. It sounds so fake, and the album itself sounds so unbelievably hollow and empty that you realise how little is actually going on here. The drums become obnoxiously loud and clamorous, the guitars sound about as processed, synthetic and powerless as is imaginable (and it doesn't help that they never break out of the formulaic tendency of chugging), and the bass sounds fucking ugly and overly loud, elbowing its way into the spotlight and drowning out everything else at times. When it doesn't do that though, the vocals take the spotlight, either in their unaltered form or (wait for it) in an ELECTRONICALLY LAYERED form! Isn't that just FUCKING wonderful? Make Anders' crappy screams sound artificial as well as shite, just like the rest of this album! \n\nAll of the musical traits of this album highlight several other issues I have here. For one, this is so unbelievably... empty. Not just sonically, but in how the album was constructed overall. No thought has gone into this at all. No time was spent copying and pasting everything and layering it. No time was spent constructing songs properly, or writing proper riffs, or doing anything RIGHT. It makes zero sense as to how fucking lazy this album is in its execution, honestly. It even sounds like they just don't give a shit - the example that stands out to me the most is at the beginning. The opening song 'F(r)iend' (blech), about 2 minutes in, goes into a change-up of sorts, where it speeds up. The problem is, the sped up part is barely any faster than the otherwise mid-tempo song. It just sounds like they can't even muster up the strength or conviction to pick up the pace. The creators of this had no sparks of creativity or passion for the material; this is now a 9 to 5 job for them, not a job and a hobby.\n\nThe issues of the production and the completely monotonous and one dimensional songs bring forth another overarching sentiment to the album - limpness. The album sounds 'ball-less' so to speak, where it can't put forth its messages of teen angst with any sort of conviction at all. I have nothing against sad / mopey music. I may not like it or listen to it, but if the band sound genuinely sad, enough to sincerely kill themselves, then THAT is balls. THAT is conviction. I get none of that from this album, the waves this thing gives off feel utterly manufactured in a grunge or emo sort of way. Whimpering and weak, and yet not really doing anything to declare the angst or sadness. No deep feelings to it, nothing strong, it is all inoffensive and bland. Take one look at song titles like 'The Quiet Place' or one sampling of the bullshit 'waaa I'm a sad suburban middle class kid, life is so tough' lyrics. Depressive rock/metal, this is not.\n\nThen there is the overall toxicity of this album, musically speaking. This is responsible for legions of sappy modern metalcore bands, who all took the shitty harmonies of this and applied it to their retarded moshcore. Acts like Killswitch Engage and Shadows Fall worship at the altar of this, and those two bands in particular spawned about... ooh I don't know... 1436873896450702 clones? This album was responsible for that, the massive popularisation of the aforementioned 'gothic/industral nu 'metal'', observable in acts like Evanescence and their explosion in popularity, and that trend's clones. Obviously, this takes its influences from elsewhere, but there is a difference between laying down a few key concepts to an insidious trend (Black Sabbath used low tunings, so do nu 'metal' artists, ergo Sabbath influenced nu 'metal'... doesn't sound right does it?) and actually being that trend incarnated (Korn made the first nu 'metal' album, hence they influenced the genre as a whole... makes more sense doesn't it?). That is what makes this thing so bad. It may have not been the first, but this was the one that all future Korn worshipers turned to.\n\nFinally, and perhaps worst of all, is just how conventional and uninventive this album is. It is slab after slab of uninventive mediocrity. It never aspires to be anything else. It isn't catchy, aggressive, atmospheric in any way; progressive, beautiful... it is nothing. This is manufactured music at its purest definition. This is LITERALLY music made as a product to be sold. There is no artistic vision, no message of any sort, no defying of conventions. It is safe and boring, and THAT is how integrity of an art form is weakened. Soulless, mediocre husks come in, through mass cloning and strong sales comes the label of 'the standard' and suddenly an entire sub section of a musical movement aspires to something with no aspirations, a dead end.\n\nNow, I won't go the full Ultraboris and say that this killed heavy metal (because it didn't, that is giving it too much credit and metal never dies), but I will be DAMNED if this isn't a festering wound on our glorious genre. It is healing for sure, as few albums can possibly directly influence a genre for over a decade, especially when this hollow and non-profound. Even then, the disease remains. The viral corruption, the core of the core... is this.\n\nStay the fuck away.\n",
        "\nNo, this is nowhere in the ballpark of their star crop material. And sadly, it begins to slide downhill halfway through, but this is still talented songwriting, albeit more infectious and hook laden. I was going to give this album a 75%, but my younger self would smack the shit out of me. The first time I heard this, my na\u00efve brain was blown away. It wasn't exactly the kind of thing trending in the mainstream (except for terrible songs like Cloud Connected), but the songwriting was just weird enough for me to get initially hooked. \n\nIt was always hilarious to me that Trigger and Cloud Connected were both singles, because Trigger shows exactly what went right with the album, whereas Cloud Connected shows exactly what went wrong. There's  scarcely  any actual death metal influence left. The closest thing is Drifter, and Transparent, which are two of my favorite tracks, but I'd be a lot more comfortable with Drifter if it was up to twice as fast, and if Transparent wasn't downtuned it would kind of suck. I have no idea why (must've been provoked by some sort of mind-altering substance) but I ordered the vinyl version of Reroute to Remain one day a few years ago. I almost always increased the speed for Drifter. I also only ever listened to the first side...\n\nThe mellowness doesn't bother me, because I hear good melodies often enough. It's not quite as melodically infectious and weird as an album like Whoracle, but I would still say it's weird enough. The general melodic theme to me, represents a melancholy sarcasm carrying half-upbeat tunes across a landscape of feeble optimism and realization of doom. The lyrics get a lot of messages across, which is an admirable aspect because after this album, the lyrics would fall into a trap of whining about relationship problems and other less abstract internal struggles. The lyrics are also not as pretty and poetic as earlier releases, but still pretty charismatic.\n\nIn summation, for a proto-metalcore pre-alt-metal sort of album that kind of became their \"Black Album,\" it really is enjoyable. The good songs, in my humble opinion, make up for almost half of it being filler. Definitely not a good first listen, but I think it's their last good album. If you're just getting into In Flames, I'd just go in order. Start with Lunar Strain, and end at this one.\n",
        "\nThe latter era of In Flames is essentially a very long and festering turd laid on the paths of metal that its listeners take through the genre. You shouldn't really have anything to do with any of the albums in question, and the only time you should really think about it is when you have to carefully step over it. They are a collection of really, really piss poor takes on a bastardised melodeath sound, i.e: unbelievably shit metalcore.\n\nSounds of a Playground Fading continues this prestigious(!) lineage without adding anything new to their already stagnant modern sound. Though every album that follows their big breakthrough Reroute to Remain is just a rehashing of said album, they at least managed to add something new to the sound. Soundtrack to Your Escape played up the keyboards and electronics, Come Clarity presents a harder-edged sound, and A Sense of Purpose is the same but with an outer coating of emo nonsense. However, this is essentially a complete retreat to familiar ground... which would be fine if said ground wasn't more barren than the Atacama desert. It is the band bastardising their sound yet again, completely chickening out for the mainstream. That is unforgivable, for this album essentially tears their already destroyed artistic principles to even smaller shreds.\n\nAnd how do they do this, you might ask? Essentially, they do exactly what they did to their other worst album (Soundtrack to Your Escape), which is take the sound from the previous album and completely de-emphasise the guitars, as well as play up the keyboards. Only this is worse, because that album was trying something new. This is a retreat to safe ground from another new sound. They effectively sand off any corners and sharp edges their music may have once had, making a completely safe album that doesn't push any sort of boundaries for either the band or this particular facet of alternative 'metal'. Of course, that won't go to well with the suburban depressed teenagers that will buy this, so they have to combat the lack of heaviness in other areas.\n\nThe lack of professionalism in the songwriting is astounding. The whole album is composed of exceptionally stagnant songs that never really put their feet down at the start or end on a resounding note. They just start after a repetitious, clean intro goes on for about 30 seconds too long, and end either when the band get bored, when Anders runs out of things to say, or when they manage to come up with another 2 grooves to fashion a whole song out of. And as with any modern album by In Flames, the tempo doesn't matter. Faster songs just go nowhere more quickly, yet last just as long as slower numbers. \n\nThe band behind the frontman reeks of one that is merely creating a background drone for the vocalist. Instruments should play the biggest part in most metal (or pseudo-metal, in the case of this). The guitars compensate for any actual heaviness through some irritating downtuned grooves, in an attempt to create a pummeling backdrop for the sad little kids to feel tough whilst listening to it. The end result is a serious lack of progression in the songs. The once great drummer Daniel Svennson does nothing good here, because as it has been since 2004, he is just being a human metronome. I can't hear the bass, so whatever. The rhythm section here does nothing, and while they do drive the songs forward, it is all completely misguided! Where the FUCK are they going? Will they wander into a shite quiet clean interlude? A sappy layered chorus? Or even, yet more irritating screechy screamo verses by Anders? You just don't know! They might do none of the above and just end the song!\n\nOh yeah... the vocals. I don't really want to talk about them, partially because that means that I have to remember them, but also because everyone knows how crap Anders is at the mic. I am pretty sure I have name-dropped him in at least 2 unrelated reviews in regards to him being the pits of modern 'extreme' vocalists. He uses what is known as the 'fry scream' technique, probably because it fries the brains of anyone that tries to listen to them. They are extremely high pitched and grating, being about one register below the 14 year old boys that front screamo bands. It is another attempt in masking the softness of the guitars, to no avail, because these aren't extreme vocals. They are crap. His cleans are no better, being really powerless, and are a true testament to how little balls this guy has in regards to his voice. They are very whiny, and perhaps more irritatingly, stomach-churning, in the sense that you know something is off about them. I think his rather good performance on Dark Tranquillity's Skydancer fucked up his voice once and for all.\n\nTo be honest, most of the criticisms above apply to any of this band's post Clayman turds. However, this is their worst yet, because of the principle of it. They had a superior variation of their established sound, and pissed it away for the third time. And even then, at least their 2002 and 2004 albums (which were the previous pissings in question) were something a bit different. This however, is literally their 2004 alt-electronicore abomination with a coating of emo through the lyrics (and some of the 'nu' with the Korn inspired name). It is a half-assed retreat to a quarter-assed sound. Avoid this, the 4 albums before it and any album after.\n\n'Last place in the jester race' indeed. Thanks for that Zodi.\n",
        "\nThis album is seriously awful. If In Flames had stuck to the dismal alt-rock crapola of A Sense of Purpose, I wouldn't have a reason to review this one, but no \u2013 they've found completely new, original ways to suck the cock of random trends and not do any of them remotely well.\n\nHave you heard Depeche Mode? How about Muse? If you answered yes to either of those things, you don't need to hear this. In Flames have saddled this album with vocal theatrics like old Muse and keyboardy, poppy songwriting like Depeche Mode, only wrapped up in a tight, suffocating cocoon of bad groove-metal riffs and mixing up the vocals with horrific imitations of what Phil Anselmo might sound like if he were reverted to his teenage years by an evil wizard. The cleaner vocals are all warbly, floaty lines that, as mentioned, sound like the band heard Absolution a couple of times but forgot what was actually good about it, and the harsh vocals are like a roach infestation, as prevalent and unpleasant as they are. When they harmonize the clean and harsh styles for almost every song's pandering choruses, it's worse than anything I could possibly describe.\n\nThe songwriting is utterly banal and disposable, with short and unremarkable lengths and no stand out hooks or clever parts. They are all built around awful radio-friendly choruses harmonized over themselves to cloistering levels to mask the fact that there are no good vocal lines. The riffs are in the background and none of them are good even for this style of muted, chunking rhythmic playing. You get a few scant clean interludes with bloopy synth sounds, which aren't offensive, but they also are so small a part of the album that you forget about them almost instantly. The band never does anything interesting with them.\n\nI can't even decide what's worse \u2013 the 90s-style wasteland of the tepid industrial fuzz-covered distortion opening up \u201cIn Plain View,\u201d or the agonizing yowling chorus of \u201cEverything's Gone.\u201d Maybe the laughable attempt at the \u201cinsightful\u201d clean-sung ode on \u201cThrough Oblivion,\u201d which is without even a scant trace of feeling \u2013 except for me wanting to reach for the puke bag. \u201cWhen the World Explodes\u201d is an unlistenable song at first, with croaking, ear-assaulting squawks from Anders and more stomping, turgid rhythms straight from the garbage can used jointly by Soulfly or Machine Head, but then it becomes something completely incomprehensible when we go into the female-sung clean atmospheric section with the floaty synths as the riffs drop out. It is jaw-droppingly random, and I challenge you to make any sense out of this. The rest of the songs are all alike \u2013 more droll, fuzzy distorted riffs, more awful harmonized choruses, and it all blends into a formless mass of annoyance.\n\nThe prevailing mood is joyless and frustrated \u2013 rather than sounding inconsolably angry or particularly sorrowful, it's more like the band is just angsty and annoyed. You never get the kind of emotional catharsis I think the band wanted you to, and the constant irritation from every sonic element of this album is excruciating to listen to.\n\nI really can't see any reason to listen to this garbage. There isn't even one redeeming factor. Siren Charms is a total failure.\n",
        "\nIn Flames are maybe a little misrepresented in the metal world, because their genre has never been scrutinised carefully since their inception. We know that they were there at the start of the melodic death metal movement, when they mixed death metal and the lead style and twin guitar stylings of more classic acts, but when the aggression started to fade (first in 'The Jester Race', then more so afterwards), they became nothing to do with death metal. 'The Jester Race' had folk melodies and very melodic riffs for the most part, but this EP doesn't have almost any death metal influence. The riffs are heavy and twisting, but certainly not extreme. The music, however varied, is mostly good.\n\nThe first song, 'Goliaths Disarm Their Davids', probably has the most content. The riff is a medium chugger and the solo flies out from Friden's decisive vocals, which makes it a heady listen. 'Gyroscope', which also has an acoustic opening, is made of the same stuff, but the other tracks are very different. The poorly named 'Acoustic Medley' is exactly that, a combination of several tracks' main themes in acoustic form. It's relaxing and folky, capturing a recognisable In Flames vibe. The live version of 'Behind Space' is great, with a vitriolic energy that is missing from this laidback release. It's maybe the highlight, though of course is inessential, not being a new piece of music.\n\nThe playing style is not noticeably different from 'The Jester Race', barring the decrease in intensity. The melodic side of the band is mostly displayed, with only 'Behind Space' showing any extreme tendencies. The two main tracks are rocking and loping, with steady riffs and simple drums, while the vocals are extreme but never dangerous. The whole EP is decent, but a much more relaxed version of In Flames, which signposts the way ahead.\n",
        "\nThe change is so there, but if you take away expectations to the point to where musical direction is concerned and has been going, then you won't object to viewing this album in a negative connotation or have a false belief. Sure, it's different, it may not be totally melodic death metal, it does have its melodic death moments, but now it's meshed into 2 genres, maybe more. The guitars are still heavy, but the music/vocals rear into a different form. They do use more electronics and clean vocals, some to the extent to think this album is somewhat in the vein of metalcore but it isn't all like that.\n\nWhat impressed me the most is the music, vocals, production and mixing as well as the lyrics. I can't see myself writing off this release to just be total crap because I wouldn't be being honest. If I thought it was just a sell-out album, I would've already stated that, but I'm not. So keep in tune to what I have to say here. Yes there is a lot less aggression, there are heavy guitars though they're not playing very fast, there are electronics, their approach is totally different and they basically don't want to keep playing what they've been playing since their founding in 1990. It's just a change.\n\nTalking more about the music, it seems like their concept was more to the effect that they wanted to mesh 2 genres together, melodic death and groove metal. They also throw in some thrash sound into it showing their influences genuinely. This I think is good. What blew me away is obligatory, but it was the lyrics which made the music so much more desirable. They're using the words which weren't overly harsh to mesh with the guitars. The clean vocals are a reflection of just how they are now, more exclusively than past releases for sure.\n\nI like every song on here. I think the rhythm guitars show their brutality even though they're not playing at fast tempos much. In Flames was never too big on making music that was overly fast, just melodic. The riffs here are thick, but they still have that melodic feel to them. They're expressing more art-work with this one and people kind of knew that the band's evolution was changing into a more laid back vibe to their songwriting than anything else. I don't think that their effort was just to go commercial with this one, I think it's just experimentation.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out on YouTube especially the title-track and \"Cloud Connected.\" Don't just consider though what I think or others think of the album, consider what you think. I don't think that I'm totally off on this, I think that this album is a \"B\" to me. Maybe it's among some of the highest ratings on the album altogether, but it's just what I think. Think \"melodic/groove/thrash/metalcore\" and you'll have all of those styles in here. I like it more than their new album, but I like most of their releases anyway. That's not because they're In Flames, it's because they put out quality music.\n",
        "\nI liked this one from the first time I heard it. I knew that after the release of 'Clayman', In Flames was rearing towards these different styles/genres being that of melodic death/groove metal if you will. So what's to be expected here is just different, it has it's moments musically, it features heavy songs with screaming, but the style is more laid back, less aggressive than prior releases even though their guitars are still tuned down a lot to I think B or C, guitarists (current) would know what they tune to on here. It is definitely more aggressive than their latest.\n\nSince the aggression is still somewhat there in the music, I'm not going to knock it down or off because it's not like they've been completely transformed (yet). The music is not too fast it's more keyed into this sort of concept they're trying to achieve with their nowadays tunes. But I wholly disagree with critics yet again because I think that the music is what made me like the album because IT IS different yet still heavy just not as intense as their earlier works such as 'The Jester Race', 'Whoracle', 'Colony' and 'Clayman'. The past is borrowed from and differentiated.\n\nI enjoyed the guest female clean vocals, I think that it was right to do, to show this change as their music just transgresses into a more thick sound with melodic/groove laden styles which fits nicely into their discography, just not as well as I think Jesper would've agreed with. But he was on the album, so it wasn't like they totally gave up their established genre, they still come forth through to make good compositions and just diversify. I'm not justifying their wanting to change it up, I'm saying that it's just a sort of transgression to \"happier\" forms of metal.\n\nThis one is one I can listen to repeatedly and not get sick of because of it's unique vibe. It's less dark as I pointed out, there are more clean vocals, slower musical tempos, not too many guitar solos, just good overall music to me at least. Other people can bash the album all they want and say they've totally sold out, but I don't think so. I think that they've just mellowed out and said basically that \"we want to change things up as we're an older band and don't want to keep releasing the same stuff over and over\". So yeah, they're into a whole different concept now.\n\nDon't be swayed by naysayers spouting out things like \"they're sell-outs\", \"their music sucks now\", etc. Form your own conclusion because most of what they play on this album is a lot different than what they started with. A musical transformation. So they really want to hold this concept and I think play what they want, even though Jesper their founding guitarist is no longer with the band. Their style yes is different, but the music on here is still good and quality. I'd think twice about what the common rating is overall and say try it on YouTube and then go with that. To me, they're still awesome and the music still is too!\n",
        "\nWhile its great sales upon being first released, the critics mostly give it a big thumbs down. That may be because these guys changed or have changed their style of music since their beginning. It is no surprise Jesper left the band probably because of that reason, they wanted to diversify and he wanted them to be what they started as which is melodic death metal. So be it as it is, this one by far no matter what critics say is a waste of a purchase. Don't buy it they say or use such things such as words like \"it makes a good coaster for a cup.\"\n\nMusically, what this has to offer is melodic metal, some groove sounding twist to it, mild tempos, all reflecting the guitars at least. I'll throw in the fact that some songs are played with clean tone, but not all or nearly all the songs are like that. They still have the thickness and good production quality, though the intensity has come way far down from what I left off with them which was 'Clayman' and out of curiosity I stumbled upon this one. I didn't think right away that this was wholly bad per se, I just though that they've just taken a huge turn.\n\nAnders sings with a few different styles which well accompany the music such as screaming, a lot of clean voice (which kind of makes them sound like metalcore) and moderate throat. All of these different types I feel work well with the music. I saw a somewhat recent interview with him featured and he's kind of trying to dissuade listeners from discounting the musical direction they've taken post-Jesper. I like how they sound still, but a simple \"like\" from me doesn't justify their abduction from melodic death to more of a melodic/groove/alternative gig.\n\nSong by song I think the sound of the music and the feel/vibe from their songwriting style now is still good and I really enjoyed the album. It's not because I myself as a human being is getting older, it's because I still think that what they have to offer musically the guitars are still heavy, all of the songs are lacking acute intensity though. They were never really huge on intensity, just melodic guitars and endless screaming. Their adjunct to the musical community is not near retrograde, it's experimenting with their sound plus the leads are still quality.\n\nIn Flames fans of the old may as they show on the reviews come up with negativity, but I come up with positivity. They still have it musically though Jesper left the band years ago, I feel that the sound is still high quality, just mild. I'm not going easy on them, I'm just saying that I don't agree with other critics. I think In Flames will go on strong for a while. I'm still to remain a fan of theirs despite their change in musical styles. They'll always to me remain a good band, I think listeners have to give this one a chance it's not garbage!\n",
        "\nBefore they tarnished their reputation with relatively bland alternative metal, In Flames were a mighty force in realm of melodic death metal, being the most popular of the famous Gothenburg trio that innovated the style in the early 1990s. In Flames combined the aggression and atmosphere of extreme metal with the accessibility of melodic metal more seamlessly than any band before them. Some scorned the band for \"polluting\" death metal with their damned melodic sensibility and sugary hooks, but what they started on this album could not be stopped. The Jester Race, along with Slaughter of the Soul, inspired legions of imitators over the next decade and still today, but THIS album was the original - and remains a work of unique inspiration and quality. \n\nThe songwriting here is absolutely top-notch. Even In Flames' most ardent detractors cannot deny that the band had a knack for beautiful melodies. This shows up in the acoustic passages (Moonshield, Jester's Dance), the guitar riffs (Dead Eternity, December Flower) and solos (Wayfaerer, Dead God In Me). During In Flames' five-year heyday (Subterranean through Whoracle), literally every melody they crafted was solid gold. And even though Anders Friden probably isn't as talented as Subterranean vocalist Henke Forss, he sounds better on this album than he ever has since. He actually has a low register with some legitimately powerful death growls on this one! Now that my metalhead ears are more seasoned, I admit that Friden is not the best melodeath vocalist out there. Tomas Lindberg and Mikael Stanne are both better. But in no way does Friden detract from the music at all, and as I said, he's at his best here. Jesper Stromblad is one of my favorite guitarists and he is consistently great on this disc as well. The band is going at full force and you can just tell they were really enjoying writing and playing this music together. The production isn't as pristine and polished as on its successors, which I actually count as a plus. It lends the music a sort of mystique they would lose later, though I love the next few albums as well.\n\nMoonshield is one of the best album starters ever with its folky acoustic intro and how it transitions into the sorrowful melodic riffing. The lyrics and vocal performance are heartfelt. And when the acoustic and electric guitars come together at the end, it's pure beauty. Other highlights include December Flower with its heavy tremolo riffing and blast beats, the winding guitar instrumental Wayfaerer, the haunting Dead Eternity with its spoken word intro, the twin guitar melodies of Artifacts of the Black Rain, and Dead God In Me with its unorthodox structure and epic climax. In truth, every song here is catchy as hell and could be listed as a highlight, which is why this album is a true must-listen. It may not have the progressive ambition of The Gallery, but it's unrelentingly FUN - an enticing listen at any time, place or mood. The Jester Race was pivotal in the development of death metal (for better or worse), but it's also a true classic of the entire Metal genre.\n",
        "\nWhoracle is probably In Flames' weakest studio release. It doesn't have the bleak atmosphere of the first releases, fails to come around with the catchy melodies and vocal lines of the transitory middle years and doesn't feature the more experimental alternative rock touch of the contemporary releases. This album feels like a rehash of the previous output The Jester Race which had a couple of decent tunes but wasn't the band's greatest hour either. A look at the track list already reveals the lack of inspiration on this album. The record is only forty-two minutes short and includes two fluffy and inoffensive filler instrumentals plus a cover track by Depeche Mode which means that there are only thirty-three minutes of own music with vocals left. It's funny enough that \"Everything Counts\" is one of the more energizing and catchier tunes and a rather interesting choice for a cover song. I have always appreciated In Flames' cover tracks and this is no exception. The experimental yet inoffensive original doesn't impress me much but this version is catchy, heavy and melodic at the same time. From the band's own material, only \"Episode 666\" reaches the same level of addictive energy and would have been an obvious single choice for such a band.\n\nThe only other standout songs are the more experimental efforts. \"Jester Script Transfigured\" is sometimes missing a clear guiding line but includes a couple of promising song writing ideas in a running time of almost six minutes. The acoustic guitar parts are moving and the distorted violon sounds add an elegant, elegiac and melancholic touch to a track that never falls off the edge. \"Worlds Within the Margin\" also breaks the five minute mark and is one of the darkest and harshest tracks on the record. It features a fine touch of symphonic elements which is rather unusual for the band. The symphonic extreme metal experiment sounds very promising though and it's sad that the band didn't push this combination of genres any further until today.\n\nThe other songs are generic melodic death metal. These tracks are short and to the point, feature a couple of harsh riffs and focus more on the vocals than before. The problem is that the vocals aren't very variable on here. The lyrics are also rather unimpressive. The riffs start to get repetitive after a while and the album doesn't include many heartbreaking melodic guitar solos. The rhythm section with bass guitar and drums is unimpressive. In Flames has never been a band centered on the rhythm instruments but this element has never been as inoffensive and unimportant as on this output. A more dynamical production would have helped to solve this problem.\n\nIn the end, Whoracle is not an abominable output but it is mostly boring, repetitive and uninspired. It's the most forgettable studio effort by a band that constantly tried out new things. It feels like an unmotivated rehash of The Jester Race where the band was just lazy and wanted to fool around a little bit. I can only recommend this release to faithful collectors and die-hard fans. It would have been a better choice to release this record as a short and entertaining EP featuring only the best tracks \"Jotun\", \"Jester Script Transfigured\", \"Worlds Within the Margin\", \"Episode 666\" and maybe the cover of \"Everything Counts\".\n",
        "\nIn Flames' pivotal fifth full length effort unites the band's past and future strengths (or weaknesses) like no other record. The release still features some faster melodic death metal elements from the past as well as the melodic twin guitar leads in the vein of Iron Maiden and a versatile vocal performance somewhere between slightly restrained growling, slightly experimental performances inspired by different groove and nu metal bands and a hesitatingly increasing number of clean vocal parts. The album also gives a hint at future records as it is filled with extremely catchy and mainstream orientated choruses, an increased used of electronic music and lyrical teams that slowly move away earlier topics such as astronomy and towards texts about inner struggles. Some fans may judge this record as the last great In Flames album, others might say that it's the first in a streak of more courageous, experimental and modern releases. Both sides are right and as some of the very few who enjoys both old and contemporary In Flames, I happen to like this release anyway.\n\nThe choruses on this album are extremely strong and probably among the very best in the band's entire career. The mid-paced and electronic-ridden \"Only for the Weak\" could also be included on one of the two follow-ups and represents the band's more accessible and less extreme metal orientated side. The melodic chorus is definitely well crafted, no matter what you think about the band's new sounds. Another strong chorus comes along in bonus track and b-side \"World of Promises\", a cover of Swedish glam rock band Treat. In my opinion, In Flames always did a good job covering tracks and I even liked their version of Metallica's \"Eye of the Beholder\" slightly better than the original. This song here is once again both energizing and melodic in an almost epic yet catchy way. The chorus contrasts with the faster and more brutal verses. I have no clue why this track wasn't included on the initial regular version as this is a fun tune and strong single candidate as well. In my book, this cover beats the original that sounds like an exchangeable Def Leppard and Europe bastard by miles. The strongest chorus is though the one in the energizing \"Pinball Map\" which is not only the best track on here but one of the band's shining moments in general and a perfect example for modern melodic death metal done rightly. The verses are fast, powerful and unchained concerning both the energizing riffs, the pitiless rhythm section and the wild vocals. The choruses comes around with beautiful guitar harmonies and some soloing just after the vocal part but also with thick restrained staccato riffs. The rhythm section grooves in an enjoyable way and never gets too sluggish. The vocals are emotional and to the point. Many people say that Anders Frid\u00e9n's vocals got worse over the years but I think that they overall improved as they got more emotional but also more controlled and skilled. In this chorus, he finds the right balance between overwhelming energy and melodic self-control. This is really a chorus for the ages and it works even better as it's not repeated to death. This is a track to relentlessly bang, dance and sing along. This song represents both old and new In Flames in a certain way and if somebody asked me to get introduced to In Flames today, I would start with this tune.\n\nOther than incredibly catchy offerings, you get to hear a balanced mixture of powerful melodic death metal from the past and more experimental tunes that hint at the band's future. In the first category, we get to hear \"Brush the Dust Away\" which is by no means the best song on here but a refreshingly short and fast tune with dynamical drumming that works well in the album context. The tune features the band's more contemporary vocal versatility but otherwise sharp riffs, dynamical sound and speed changes and great guitar melodies. The closing wrecking ball \"Another Day in Quicksand\" goes even further back to the roots and solely features Anders Frid\u00e9n's charismatic early harsh vocals, extended sharp riffs, a few crunching breakdowns and a calmer bridge with elegant melodic guitar solos. This energizing outburst is a fitting way to close a gripping record without any lengths.\n\nThe second category delivers with the versatile grower \"Square Nothing\" that mixes the best elements of everything In Flames would deliver in the future: fast-paced verses, melodic pre-choruses and choruses, enchanting guitar melodies and even solos, calm breakdowns in an alternative rock fashion, weird sound collages including church bells, vocals that are sometimes sung, screamed or whispered, a dominant use of keyboards and many different genres and styles covered in less than four minutes without sounding pointlessly put together. Only few bands can put so many ideas in one single song and make it sound perfectly coherent. That's one element that makes In Flames stand out. The melancholic \"Satellites and Astronaut\" can be seen as a more rhythm orientated predecessor to tracks like \"The Chosen Pessimist\", \"Liberation\" and \"Through Oblivion\". This song is probably the most atmospheric and versatile of In Flames so-called half-ballads and maybe also the band's best offering in this category. I would say that this track is the second best on this concise output.\n\nIf we look at this release today, this is probably a reconciliatory record for both fans of the early days and the contemporary phase. On this record, both worlds harmoniously collide in almost equal parts. Otherwise, the short and concise song writing and some incredibly catchy choruses make this album stand out as a high quality release in the band's extensive discography. This release doesn't include any fillers and only above average to excellent songs. This album may not be as revolutionary as \"Lunar Strain\", as consistent as \"Subterranean\" and as versatile as \"Sounds of a Playground Fading\" but it's definitely a highlight in the band's career that both old and new fans should know and own.\n",
        "\nLook, I might not be into In Flames so much, but I can tell you this. In their earlier days, they sounded a lot better. I'm not gonna be one of those people that are gonna say \"oh, they were fantastic when they did 'The Jester Race' and now they're all emo\" and all of that, 'cos even before they got more famous, they've made use of melody in their songs, especially in \"The Jester Race\". It's really nothing new with In Flames at all, except here, we've got songs that sound more like some popular song playing in a suburban middle-school kid's bedroom in 2006. Though I would say that \"The Jester Race\" is a good album, in my opinion, it's nowhere near being as good as other albums from other bands that put melody into their work, like Amon Amarth. Even with that being said, it's no excuse for \"A Sense of Purpose\" to sound like the next biggest thing in 2008, therefore redundant.\n\nI said before that In Flames makes use of a more melodic style to their death metal, except here, we're not really hearing much death metal at all. We don't get so much of those low, guttural vocals that dominated past albums, and the melodic style here has evolved into more of an alternative style. Most of the guttural vocals are replaced by a somewhat whiny-sounding melodic voice, the kind of vocals you'd hear on an \"emo\" band album. Now, I wouldn't mind that so much, but they sing the sort of melodies that also appear on that kind of album. These vocal melodies have that kind of alternative/pop feel to it, making them a pain to listen to. Speaking of \"emo\", the album also contains the all-cliche theme of sadness and angst. Right from the get-go, we have lyrics related to angst. Don't like it? Get used to it, there's gonna be a lot of it! Believe me, you can't really expect much to come out of lyrics such as this gem from \"Sleepless Again\": \"I don't want to take part, prefer to be forever numb\". The sad thing? A lot of bands did this sort of thing back in 2008, and as you can see, it got really old, really fast. And due to the alternative/pop style melody that poisons both the instruments and vocals, it seems like every song on here sounds like a Sick Puppy reject. \n\nFor this reason, it's really hard to tell the difference between \"Move Through Me\" and \"The Mirror's Truth\", 'cos they all sound like the exact same song. They're using the exact same kind of melodies with the exact same chord patterns. Pure genius! Anders Friden doesn't put a lot of energy into his vocals, but even when he does, it just ends up sounding incredibly weak. All you'd need to do to get the idea is to listen to the first few minutes of, say, \"Alias\", and you'd get a clear idea of what effect Friden is trying to achieve. If he's trying to achieve the effect of some angsty teen upset over some popular girl at school rejecting him, he's doing it quite nicely. The guitars are obviously heavy, but again, they play this sort of alternative/pop melody, and it really defeats the purpose of the music being the least bit exciting. They're also incredibly grainy. The drums aren't much better, 'cos the production quality put a lot of emphasis on the bass drum being real light and the snare being real deep. Even the album cover has something for me to complain about. I swear, I'm looking at a Miss May I t-shirt, 'cos I'm seeing this cartoony owl thing-like person (I don't know) with brightly-colored cartoony tentacle things coming out of the ground. Everything just looks so fake and plastic, it just gives you the perfect idea of what to expect when listening to this album. I certainly didn't expect much when I looked at the cover. \n\nDon't expect the eight-minute \"opus\", \"The Chosen Pessimist\" to be any better, either, 'cos it's just another one of those \"emo\" songs that's extended an extra five minutes. In fact, the vocals that Friden sing sound even whinier than the vocals in any other song on here. He even groans and moans a little, a sign that the song is probably yet another one about angst (as if the song's title didn't already throw you off!). The song starts off with the usual light-guitars-playing-a-sad-sounding-hook formula and it continues throughout much of the song, until approximately five minutes in, when the heavy guitars come in. I'm not even kidding, people, it doesn't even get heavier until after five full minutes. It doesn't get much better when the guitars do get heavier, for they play the same kind of sad-sounding hook and the song just plods along until the end That's not all, there's even a drum machine mixed in that plays the sort of pop-like beat you'd hear in...you get the idea. Eight minutes does not make a song your equivalent of \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", it's how you use the amount of time you have, and you're certainly not using that time well with the sort of stuff I'm hearing. \n\nFor the love of all that is holy, you don't have to make every song about angst and make it sound like angst. It would've been more tolerable if there were only a select few songs on the album (a.k.a. just one song) that had that theme, but nope. It's all about whining about how much your life sucks 'cos your mom won't get you an Xbox. It's getting really annoying. I might not listen to In Flames as much as other people, but I have a very hard time trying to figure out how this mascara-laced garbage managed to sneak its way into the collections of many metallers. I've got quite a lot to say about this horrendous bucket of pig manure, but I'm afraid that if it were to fill a book, it'd be thicker than all of the Lord of the Rings books combined.\n",
        "\nAs a huge In Flames fan, I have never been so disappointed by an album so goddamn much since Metallica's Lulu. Siren Charms is In Flames' latest installment, an opportunity that was completely wasted! Let's be real here, In Flames over the past few years hasn't had a very impressive track record. Come Clarity was probably the most decent album they've released in the past decade and everything from there onwards blew up in their faces. Siren Charms was an opportunity for the band to redeem themselves to their fans but instead they focused too much on experimentation rather than actually making their album sound good. Experimentation isn't a bad thing, it's part of progression, but In Flames have done this so many times before now. Honestly, this sounds nothing different from their previous release. Except maybe the fact that this one sucks even more because it's basically rehash of \"Sounds of a Playground Fading.\"\n\nLet's start off with the basics. Anders Friden's vocals have to be the most annoying thing on the entire album. His growls and screams are barely there, popping up occasionally, and are replaced by his actual singing voice, which are so out of key it's killing me. We're talking about Anders fucking Friden here! What happened to the harsh vocals we heard on albums like \"Colony,\" \"Clayman\" or even something more recent like \"Come Clarity?\" Instead we get some half-assed clean vocals that make the band sound like some pop group. Even more so due to the synth you hear in the background, which I swear you could hear something similar on a fucking One Direction release. Both of these elements fused together has to be the album's biggest downfall and benefactor as to why this release sucks. Everything else, be it the guitars and drums, are all soft as hell. Rarely do you even get a heavy bridge or fast riff. It's practically non-existent. If you came here expecting something truly heavy and powerful, it's not on here because at least 90% of this album is soft! It seems almost unfair to call these guys a melodic death metal band. They're melodic, they're a band but there's literally no metal to be found whatsoever on this release. Friden's whiny bitch vocals mixed with a weak band supporting them makes this nothing more than a pop release. There's distortion but it doesn't do the music justice.\n\nI will admit that there are some riffs and parts in certain songs that sound okay. I'm still a huge fan of Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte's guitar style despite his work on here. There are some solos of his that I actually could enjoy but that, of course, was short-lived because of everything else drowning it out. I have to say that \"When the World Explodes\" has to be the only impressive track on this piece, it's not stellar but I at least have to point out something good on this album. It's not all bad, it just went against everyone's expectations. When I heard of this piece, I was actually pretty stoked on the fact In Flames could make something really good here and redeem themselves, to show the fans they're still capable on making something powerful. Instead they relied on like one or two tracks and said: \"hey guys, we're still heavy but we're going to stick with sounding like a pop rock band now because that's what you guys want, right?\" Wrong! So fucking wrong! In the end, this album is way below average. It's boring, soft, gets stale really fast and not worth any of your money. Whatever In Flames releases next, I'm not excited for it. At this point, we've been fucked over so many times by these guys that we're having a hard time believing that their next release will be worthwhile. It's kind of hard to say \"In Flames We Trust\" without feeling like I'm kidding myself. To me, they're not melodic death metal until they release something that can actually start a mosh pit.\n",
        "\nThe sound of Whoracle is rife with grimy, grungy aesthetics, the sort of subdued guitar playing with some acoustics sprinkled in and of course, screecing, irritating vocals that clash with the music. I guess I just never got In Flames, but after years and years of listening to melodic metal I feel like I'm about as qualified as I'm ever going to be to talk about it.\n\nI guess there's no point in beating around the bush \u2013 the harsh vocals don't work. Even if Friden was really good, it would probably still sound a bit too out of place to totally gel, but seriously these are some of the worst vocals I've ever heard. He sounds like a cat with Strep throat being run over by a lawnmower. How is this enjoyable? I can kind of see the music being enjoyable, but the vocals are so omnipresent in this thing and so relentlessly unentertaining and unlistenable I can barely stand to hear even one song. He's just complete shit. I dunno what kind of a person he is in real life, and I hate to just start off right out of the gates bashing this dude I know nothing about, but come on \u2013 the sore-throat howling all over this album is seriously just unbearable.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, he also switches it up now and then for a truly ridiculous sounding muttering spoken-word voice that's supposed to sound like Lou Reed or something \u2013 and if not, then I guess it's just supposed to sound ominous. He usually does this over the acoustic sections, which is a blessing because I think putting his normal harsh voice over those would have been just too much to bear. But it still sounds ludicrous and embarrassing, with no real charisma or power behind it \u2013 it sounds like your dorky older brother who just hit puberty trying to scare your sister's hot friends at a Halloween party with the lights off.\n\nIt just clashes with the music, too \u2013 this is very low-key music, and at best, if I really stretched it, I'd say maybe some really deep, dark, Nick Holmes on the early Paradise Lost albums kind of growl would have fit this music. Certainly not Friden's caterwauling. The music isn't very dark or creepy or anything \u2013 it's rather relaxed, melodic music with a pinch of fuzzy, cynical 1990s-style heaviness and a certain kind of melancholy at times in the atmosphere and acoustics, but really nothing that screams \u201cthis needs harsh vocals, right now.\u201d Clean vocals would work better here \u2013 not clean vocals delivered by Anders Friden, but clean vocals delivered by anybody else would certainly be an improvement.\n\nHarsh vocals are to be used like instruments, not to actually carry melody and be sounded out like regular vocals \u2013 and they certainly shouldn't be used at the forefront of the fucking music all the time. Despite my rather dogmatic views on this, I do believe people should continue to do what they want and experiment with music. After all, that's the beauty of human expression. However, when your experiments and fresh ideas turn out like this, I guess I'm just getting off at the next stop and don't want to go any further on your train ride to shit.\n\nI will say that he does sound better on here than any of the subsequent albums I've sampled. I couldn't make it even one full song through Clayman for example \u2013 eugh.\n\nThe music isn't really that special or anything \u2013 it's very droll, basic melodic metal with chugging riffs interspliced with rather saccharine melody lines, and it never goes too fast, too slow or anything; it's right in the middle really. The song structures are pretty poppy and most of them tend to sound alike. There's just not a lot going on and the whole is really rather banal and bland. The bright spots come in the way of the acoustics, which are kind of nice and do tend to spice up the rest of the music. The instrumental \u201cDialogue with the Stars\u201d is actually good and kind of interesting, and \u201cJester Script Transfigured\u201d is musically the most adventurous track with its segues between acoustic and heavier parts. But most of the other songs fail to capitalize on the moody atmosphere the band wants to convey, and a lot of that may be down to having to follow Friden's limited vocals. I dunno; I could be wrong about that \u2013 who ever knows what's going on inside a band's studio? But either way it's uninspiring.\n\nIf this is some kind of classic now, well so be it, but it's not one I need to hear again.\n",
        "\nI probably should have discovered In Flames earlier than I did, what with being a fan of Arch Enemy and all. For whatever reason I didn't though, and here I am only reviewing the album 'The Jester Race' now, a long, long time after it was first recommended to me.\n\nThey do have a very likable quality about the sound that comes with this album, from the strange melodies on the opener 'Moonshield' that sound almost medieval to the heavier riffs on 'Lord Hypnos' and 'Dead Eternity' (although all the tracks are a nice mix of heavy and melodic). You can quite clearly tell that a lot of bands have taken heavy influence from this album, and it's no wonder that this band are considered one of the pioneers of melodic death metal.\n\nI liked the track 'Artifacts of the Black Rain' more than the others, possibly because it was more in my comfort zone than the other tracks (which basically means it sounded more like Arch Enemy's style). The hooks come fast, but not thick to the extent that nothing else can be heard. The drumming isn't sensational, but it does provide a solid beat in the background. Most of the emphasis seems to be on the two guitars, the rhythm guitar making the general sound while the lead provides some melody to the song. Vocals are okay, nothing special but they're far from poor.\n\n'Dead God in Me' is a little more confusing and less likable, the drums just pounding along at parts in a way that feels more black metal than death metal (not that I'm some kind of expert on that). For the most part the melodies are gone, but when they return they're nice (even if they sound a little reminiscent of pirate metal at parts, which is a bit out of place). I don't really get the fade out near the end for twenty or so seconds before the music returns to play the album out, which just adds to the confusion of the track. I really feel like I sit on the fence with this track.\n\nThe title track takes a more death metal type approach to it, but the melody is still there. The vocals on this track are better than the others, sounding deeper and more like Johan Hegg from Amon Amarth (which is always a good thing). The song as a whole is a great example of what this band can do, as they quite clearly demonstrate between this song, 'Dead God in Me' and 'Artifacts of the Black Rain' that they can come up with a variety of different ways to play melodeath.\n\nNow, something that I don't like is that there are almost no signs of warning before some of the songs end. Besides the fact that they've been going on a while, some tracks just leave you to guess whether they're almost done or not. It's not the worst thing imaginable, but it does get a little bit annoying.\n\nTo conclude, I did like the album a lot, but it's not perfect. Of course no album is, but this one feels a lot further away than some others. Ultimately some of the tracks do drag it down a bit, perhaps stopping me from giving it a score in the nineties rather than mid-eighties. Still, they practically came up with the genre along with Dark Tranquility and At the Gates and this is very much a prototype for the rest of the genre to take on board, something that later bands would do with the best possible outcomes.\n",
        "\nThere was much apprehension when Jesper Str\u00f6mblad left In Flames. A Sense of Purpose was a solid album but it wouldn't win over folks that only like the old In Flames. The band was at risk of putting out an album that made even Soundtrack To Your Escape sound good in comparison. Sounds Of A Playground Fading would not be that album, despite the silly name. It was a bit of a departure, but not quite a radical shift in sound. It was mostly A Sense of Purpose II but minus any of Jesper's riffs. Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte did his damn best to make it sound like In Flames, and also included many catchy and lengthy solos. But he fails miserably this time, and Soundtrack To Your Escape is no longer In Flames' worst album. \n\nSiren Charms has some of the elements that made Sounds Of A Playground Fading a decent album (although not one well liked by those who are fans of old In Flames). However, there were parts of Sounds that were awful and unusual - The Attic was an odd break with weird Anders vocals, The Jester's Door was a definite nod to Jesper's departure but not a very well executed one and Liberation was for the most part a song that was better suited to the soundtrack of an Adam Sandler movie. \n\nFor some reason, In Flames decided to build on Liberation instead of A New Dawn. We get a bunch of songs that are best suited for shitty romantic comedies and teen dramas instead of a heavy metal concert. There are no songs that effectively throwback to the old days like A New Dawn did. There are some riffs that are decent and Bj\u00f6rn does a decent job with the solos, which is the best part of the album - when Anders shuts up and lets Bj\u00f6rn play. However, nothing is consistent - even the best songs on this album have their cringe moments. \n\nIncidentally, they took two of the best songs from this album cycle and relegated them to \"exclusive\" bonus tracks (like that is a thing these days). The Chase is a lot like the songs on A Sense of Purpose and Become The Sky is tolerable aside from Anders being Anders. Within the album proper, the first three are also tolerable - In Plain View and Paralyzed has Anders experimenting with \"soaring\" clean vocals, which aren't that terribly bad. Everything's Gone has a bit of a cringeworthy start and it's a bad attempt at remaking Take This Life but I'm not particularly averse to it even with the odd deep vocals mixed with the pseudo-death metal. \n\nThrough Oblivion is a passable alternative rock song but nothing much more. There could be some comparisons to Katatonia and maybe mid-period Anathema. With Eyes Wide Open goes for the nosedive, this would be best suited to the end credits of some hogwash teen movie with 16 year old high school students out on a date that their parents drove them to despite it being a midnight showing and taking selfies in the theater with glitter covered iPhones. It doesn't get much better - except for When The World Explodes, which has a really cool part with a female guest vocalist doing Nightwish like vocals which actually works except for the silly part where Anders tries to mimic Peter Steele at the end. Oh and, the verse vocals are about as tolerable as hearing a pterodactyl being raped. Rusted Nail takes the breakdown from Superhero of a Computer Rage and smacks it in between the loud alternative rock chorus with Anders singing and the damn noodling main \"riff\". It's the song that best represents the entirety of the album - it starts off promising, like In Plain View, then recycles material from their new albums (sort of like Everything's Gone but much more blatant), goes into experimental alternative rock territory, has Bj\u00f6rn trying to make the song better with a guitar solo, then from there does fuck all. \n\nFiltered Truth has a pretty cool riff in it but the rest is crap. I don't know what else to say about this album. Peter Iwers is in this album somewhere. I really only hear him at the beginning of the title track but his part is Pro-Tools to death. I have been an In Flames fan for the better part of nine years now and I started with Reroute to Remain and Soundtrack To Your Escape. It was later that I got into their older albums. This is the first they disappointed me, now I know how people felt when Reroute To Remain came out just two years after Clayman. The only silver lining to this is there is a chance, albeit slim, that In Flames will finally listen to their fanbase and stop flirting with shitty alternative rock... but now that I've openly said that their next album is probably Lulu meets Nikki Minaj.\n",
        "\nThis is a pretty decent alternative rock album.\n\nThe above sentence was the first thing that popped in my head after my third listening session of In Flames\u2019 2014 album, \u201cSiren Charms\u201d. If this wasn\u2019t a serious website that encourages serious writing, I would\u2019ve left it at that, called it a day and sent the review to queue. \n\nFans of old school In Flames are indeed a curious bunch. You know the drill: we hear whispers of a new release and are met with a feeling of absolute apathy as we bloody reckon it is going to be yet another hour long sonic mass of nothing, save for a couple of seconds (or minutes, if luck wills it) of inspired musicianship; maybe a lead line that winks at the glories of old, or perhaps a riff that surpasses the oppressive clutches of modern groove metal, or maybe even a real rage-filled growl, but then there\u2019s only an endless void the band seems content to fill with simplistic chord progressions, underwhelming drumming, solos that feel like a rushed afterthought and a grown man sobbing about vaguely romantic issues in way that wouldn\u2019t be out of place if revealed to have been written by any wordsmith of blas\u00e9 adolescent poetry such as Gerard Way. \u201cThat\u2019s how it goes, so suck it up and give this one a chance\u201d, I keep telling myself as I soldier on and hit \u201cplay\u201d.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a twist this time. In here, there\u2019s a pervasive feeling of freedom, like they finally gave up putting the \u201cWe\u2019re a metal band\u201d mask on and were reborn as what they\u2019ve always strived to be since STYE: an alt rock band with downtuned, pummelling mosh riffs. No more faux growls (keep them to a bare minimum), no more trying to emulate melodies of yore, no more treading lightly, just limp-wristed riffing and gratuitously catchy hooks all the way, baby. Can\u2019t say I blame them, though. None of those guys are kids anymore, and their sellout gimmicks have already raised them a sturdy new fanbase which could not give less of a shit about musical integrity as long as the new songs RAWWWK, so we\u2019re done. The message is clear: In Flames have paid their dues, and now they\u2019re gonna play whatever the flying fuck they want to, so you might as well treat this as a Michael Bay film by turning off your brain in order to enjoy the spectacle, since there\u2019s hardly any true depth to be found. So yes, this is In Flames\u2019.... Ehm, \u201ccoming out\u201d album.\n\nGelotte, Iwers and Engelin play with such shallowness that I cannot bring myself to say anything relevant about them. It\u2019s all... harmless, stock-standard. No riffs, solos or bass lines have caught my attention whatsoever, serving merely as placeholders because this is supposed to be a rock band. I enjoy the leads beneath the choruses of \u201cIn Plain View\u201d, \u201cParalyzed\u201d and \u201cDead Eyes\u201d even though they\u2019re simpler than a cheese sandwich. Svensson once again takes up the heroic task of bringing interesting drum fills and tasteful variations to a slew of rudimentary rock n\u2019roll beats and does a fine job, like the double bass that accelerates and slows down at constant intervals during the verse of \u201cEverything\u2019s Gone\u201d. And that\u2019s all, folks. Sorry.\n\nNow it\u2019s prime time, my friends. Oh believe me, for what\u2019s coming up next could be considered a miracle of biblical proportions. I really don\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually typing this, but ladies and gentleman, \u201cSiren Charms\u201d marks the first time Anders Friden actually tried and succeeded in projecting tolerable clean vocals. Brother, you are not dreaming. Sister, allow me to collect that jaw you just dropped on the ground. Clearly, Frid must\u2019ve taken a hint (from someone who should be canonized) and sought out vocal lessons, because his technique here shows noticeable improvement over... well, anything he\u2019s ever done in the past. Of course, it\u2019s not perfect and sometimes THAT dreadful whine comes back, but it is becoming less and less frequent as the veteran singer shows greater comfort in exploring his range and applying better diaphragm control to avoid sliding off tune. Even those little Michael Jackson yelps that have been plaguing his voice for years are slowly being phased out.\n\n\u201cParalyzed\u201d, for an example, is the sound of a man who has been listening to his singing coach. Vocals crawl at a languid pace in the verses only to finally grow into a non-complicated, catchy melodic line held together by the very first time I hear this guy utilize a proper breathing technique to reach a higher register, with his trademark whining nasal tone being thankfully left only to the first chorus\u2019 last phrase. My ears perk up. Since IF\u2019s songwriting has been unapologetically formulaic for the past decade, I know the refrain is coming back for a least a couple more times. Of course it does, and Friden has the good idea of changing a couple things here and there, holding a grand finale for last, in which he explodes in carefully drawn out notes, followed by a truly ferocious scream that morphs into a strangled, emotionally tuneful C# thus ending the song in an unexpectedly epic note. Remarkable! Now, imagine if he sung like that in older albums and marvel at the possibilities. Credit must be given where it\u2019s due, though.\n\nOther interesting parts can be heard in \u201cThrough Oblivion\u201d, a vocal-centric number in which Anders makes the welcome decision of inverting the predictability of the song\u2019s emotional peaks, leaving the last part relatively unchanged whilst choosing to soar in the second chorus and following middle section with delicate melodies. Also, \u201dWhen the World Explodes\u201d features the album\u2019s second most attention grabbing hook with Anders sharing vocal duties with a female singer, and as she hovers angelically in the middle-high register, Friden projects a surprisingly rich baritone underneath, laying a perfect bed. I\u2019d up his volume a little bit if I was the sound engineer for this. Yes, it is that good.\n\nMusicianship-wise, \u201cSiren Charms\u201d is the exact inversion of \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d. As that classic album had amazing guitars and dull vocals, this one has In Flames\u2019 most forgettable riffs and melodies ever and is saved by Anders Friden\u2019s maturity as a singer, almost two decades later. Better late than never, I suppose.\n\nAs a heavy metal album, \u201cSiren Charms\u201d fails miserably by presenting us unmemorable guitars, predictable song structures and In Flames once again wasting a very good drummer and, now, a singer\u2019s newfound ability to do his thing. Skip it if you\u2019re looking for honest, well thought-out metal, but if you\u2019re into alt rock with an edge, then this is your stuff and you\u2019ll enjoy it to no end. Had this been the \"Alternative Rock Archives\", I'd give it a 70%.\n\n\"When you had enough, break out!\"\n",
        "\nIt's never easy when listening to an aberration like Siren Charms to admit to oneself: 'This band meant something to me once'. But I'd be lying to say they didn't, because for at least the first half of their career they were churning out a very strong case for the melodic death metal archetype as a whole, and in particular The Jester Race remains for me an obvious go-to album whenever I'm craving some guitar-driven, melodic, inspirational bliss. And, to some degree, they have morphed into one of those bands I have so much history with that I probably will never 'ignore' one of their new records outright, clinging to the faint hope that they might one day rekindle the strength and momentum of the songwriting that used to define them. Once in awhile, they will still surprise me, as they did on A Sense of Purpose in 2008, the one album they've released past the turn of the century which I have actually enjoyed. Modern and 'emo', with a little groove, sure...but packed with great In Flames riffs and a few tunes (like \"Alias\") that I daresay were unique enough that you're likely never going to hear them anywhere else.\n\nBut since that point...six years of steady declination, first with Sounds of a Playground Fading, a watered down and 'safer' alternative to A Sense of Purpose (which was already plenty accessible and kid friendly with the Korn-like artwork), and now with Siren Charms, as structured a squamous midlife crisis turd as they've ever escorted out the studio doors, and I'd be hard pressed to think of a past album I enjoyed less...maybe Soundtrack to Your Escape, or Come Clarity, but I'd have to go back and re-listen to them, and after forcing myself through THIS a requisite third time (with alcohol stirred into my coffee), the mood does not strike me to do so. Siren Charms is a record that not only gives credibility to the voices that have been shouting down this band for whatever reason (changes in sound, general visibility and appeal), but compounds their complaints by channeling some of the most shallow, redundant grooves and banal plastic pop-rock oriented songwriting you've ever heard outside fucking Abba (who are exponentially better than this on a bad day). Disclaimer: I have no problem with a band evolving or devolving its sound in whatever direction. If In Flames put out a record that sounded like Seven and the Ragged Tiger, or Thriller, and it was GOOD, then I would be the first on board and let the naysayers choke on my exhaust.\n\nThis is not good.\n\nUN-good. You keep waiting for the money shot and it stays softcore, with your eyes affixed on its shaved bottom as it thrusts halfheartedly for the camera crew. Let me slightly abridge that...there are two, possibly three minor 'positives' to the experience. The electronics used throughout the disc, like in the intro to opener \"In Plain View\", gave me the false impression that the album might explore the sort of retro future synth stuff that I've been heavily into lately, which I admit might be a pretty cool blend with some solid melodeath riffing (bands have done synth stuff in this niche before, but not quite in the way I'm picturing). Where these lines appear, they're sort of cool, but there just aren't enough of them to feel like it's a fully realized idea, they are simply intros or distractions. Secondly, as much as I'm not interested in hearing Anders' whining, cleaner vocals, he has actually succeeded here in smoothing over his pitch and delivery so they don't feel quite so ragged and screamy as they have since Reroute to Remain where he started leaning in this direction. I'm just saying, if N'Flames was truly to become N'Sync, now he just needs the dance moves, because he could get by on his voice with the support of another four boys. Finally, there are a handful (less than a handful) of riff passages on the disc that don't deserve my complete loathing, because they approach A Sense of Purpose levels of memorability at the very least, with that same style of processed nu-thrash.\n\nOtherwise, the album is one for the dogs. The band spends so much time trying to build a strong chorus that they can barely stick one...even on a tune like \"Through Oblivion\" where it does carry some emotional poignancy but it always feels half-formed, like they were going to induce another melody or twist in there and it just doesn't happen. There is far, far too much fucking restraint on this album, to the extent that I almost found myself pleading for Anders to RETURN to that dirty and whiny voice, only because it felt more passionate. This just feels heavily overdubbed, punched in laconically in-studio and generally scrapped together, whether it's the vocal placement or the riffs, a few of which have nice, gently layered harmonies in a cubicle, corporate pop metal sens. There are some tracks like \"With Eyes Wide Open\" which are downright embarrassing, like they were trying to write material for a long lost Boston album for the ladies and the lighters. And without exception the groove/nu metal riffing substrate is lamentably bad, without even an inkling of a stylish idea or a pattern of chords that at least makes you want to genuinely shake your ass.\n\nSome will take exception as always to the tidy, mechanized production values, but that is the least of the issues with this disc. The cover artwork: bland. The female guest vocals on \"When the World Explodes\": ridiculous, making it sound like a throwaway Epica/Nightwish/Within Temptation crossover. Who-cares bass-lines and paint-by-numbers metalcore chug-downs. The lyrics are generally very ambiguous accessible emotional crap like 'In the darkest of nights/you are my endless fire inside' or 'Where I have nothing/there's no hate/room to breathe/no envy and nothing to lose'...a bunch of nonsense that the guy will claim is very 'personal' and 'self-affirmation' oriented but was probably written lazily on a napkin at some restaurant on tour. Song titles are almost unanimously cliches that have been done so many times before (with the exception of \"Siren Charms\" itself), and at its very best, they've only got tunes on this that are 1/4th of what a good modern In Flames track should incorporate. Even if we ignore the band they used to be, when they were constantly on the upswing career-wise, and pretend they formed up in 2001, there are infinitely better songs on Reroute to Remain or A Sense of Purpose. Even the last full-length was an order of magnitude superior and I struggled to remember many of the specifics 15 minutes of hearing them...\n\nI understand Frid\u00e9n is probably venting his anger that he's not in Killswitch Engage or Ariana Grande's dance partner or something, but I just can't understand how members like Gelotte and Iwers let themselves be continuously booked a berth on this sinking ship. Are the paychecks really all that fat? Perhaps at the next 'minutes in the meeting of the hiveminds of In Flames' the two of you can just get up and each kick Anders in one of his balls, though I have my doubts they are still in place, and put out a proper fucking metal album again with blazing, inspirational harmonies, savage words and riffs that get the heads banging. This album has no heads banging, in any sense of the phrase... impotent, joyless major label tripe that deserves all the excrement foisted upon it. Despite what I said in the opening paragraph, I'm going to have a hard time justifying any curiosity for what comes next.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIn Flames has come a long way from their days as Gothenburg-pioneers. Their sound has changed on every album, to lighter direction during recent years. On Siren Charms their musical journey continues and reaches the point where around half of the people think that they have gone too far. Is it too far or is Siren Charms just a bad album as far as it represents alternative metal genre? \n\nMy first reaction to \"Rusted Nail\", the number one single, was \"what the hell happened to this band? This song is totally empty and hollow. How I'm supposed to like this?\" Because of that disappointment I was really scared to listen the second pre-album song, \"Through Oblivion\". Somehow it hit me much better and this pop kind of song with phlegmatic atmosphere was actually really good but it wasn't In Flames-like song. That moment I realized that I shouldn't compare this album to any other of their albums, it just wouldn't work and I wouldn't like the whole damn record. As the album release was near, I gave \"Rusted Nail\" a new chance and boom! I was hooked. The rhythm world and the guitar fills just opened to me and soon I was singing the whole song along Anders. I would totally buy the album.\n\nI said that this album shouldn't be compared to other IF albums too much but one thing I have noticed there. First time in this band's career, the techno stuff brings something good to the song and raises the song's value and the synth is used in good taste. Synth sounds make songs like \"Paralyzed\", \"In Plain View\" and \"Filtered Truth\" shine the way they wouldn't do without 'em. \n\nThough Siren Charms is still mainly metal(ish), the songs have much pop influence. With less distortion I could almost imagine \"With Eyes Wide Open\", \"Through Oblivion\" and \"Siren Charms\" coming from the radio. I mean, non-rock radio. Anyway, it doesn't matter if the music doesn't make you bang your head with extreme velocity. Of course this is just my opinion but I think that this album is a very interesting collection of rock, metal, pop and techno elements. This record isn't about heaviness, melodies, feeling or experimenting. It's all of them and also none of them, it's a different case do you find those things you like there.\n\nI don't get bored while listening to the album because it's very variable. Different feelings in different songs. The music communicates through the feelings and the strength of the album isn't really musicians' virtuosity but sharing the right feelings. \n\nAll of the songs on the album have something good about them, some more than the others. Generally, I find \"Paralyzed\", \"With Eyes Wide Open\" and \"Filtered Truth\" maybe the three best tracks. \"Siren Charms\" is also really great but it really disturbs me that the song is too short and the good idea there could have been developed further. I wouldn't like to diss any particular songs but \"Dead Eyes\" and \"Monsters in the Ballroom\" seem to get nowhere in some points, though \"Dead Eyes\" has pretty liberating chorus.\n\nI haven't listened to a lot of alternative metal and won't compare IF to any other band there, not sure if that's possible anyway. In Flames is flying in their own spheres and giving zero f**ks to everybody trying to criticize their doings. It's really weird that people are complaining about band's musical progression and changing style while some bands are being criticized from doing the same album over and over again. No matter what you do, you can't make everybody happy even if you wanted. In Flames has internalized this and they are going the way they want. If you didn't like Siren Charms, maybe the next album then. We don't know. I keep my mind open and I'm pretty sure that I'll dig IF's next record no matter where their music goes. In Flames we trust!\n",
        "\nAs far as In Flames albums go, this is possible one of the weakest and diverse albums to date, which is possibly why I found myself enjoying it after a while. Initially, this review was going to be a scathing attack about what went into this album, but having given it time, and a dozen or more listens, I think I actually ENJOYED it...I'm just not sure.\n\nOn the surface, you've got an album which to all intents and purposes (next album's title?) is following the route which In Flames seems to be making for themselves in recent years from Sounds of a Playground Fading and A Sense of Purpose pathing the way to this.\n\nIn Flames picked up a second full time guitarist In Niclas Engelen, singer and guitarist for Engel, and his appearance isn't ultimately noticeable as he filled in for the missing Jesper Stromblad, whether or not Jesper would've put anything extra into this release is questionable, but both Niclas and Bjorn seem to have taken a bit of a backseat with regards to input into this album beyond simply writing a few basis riffs into it, where previous albums before A Sense of Purpose would've been noted for complexity of guitar work and commended Jesper and Bjorn for it, this simply can't be the case for this album.\n\nThe album itself seems to be a Greatest Hits style affair, to me at least, with different sounds sampled from albums post-2000; Rusted Nail and In Plain View hitting Soundtrack to your Escape and Reroute to Remain square on the head, Monsters in the Ballroom seemingly hitting A Sense of Purpose, whilst Through Oblivion and Everything's Gone seem to take the same sort of approach to intros as Come Clarity, but with a bit more.\n\nAs far as reviewing this album goes, it'll be (it's) hard not to do this on a track by track basis as the album simply doesn't stick to a single theme, style or manner in which it's approached - Everything's Gone present a bizarre mixture of old In Flames and a sort of Marilyn Manson hybrid during the choruses to create what sounds like a mess, but actually works out for the band as Anders' vocals provide a coarse, almost appealing, growl which makes the song work.\n\nParalyzed has a style which listeners might associate with A Sense of Purpose-era, with the main style of the song performed in a manner which sounds very similar to that of March to the Shore, The Mirror's Truth or possibly even Delivery Us (from Sounds of a Playground), it does this so convincingly, that it sounds like it could've even been recorded during the period between releases, almost as a stop gap. \n\nLeading onto Through Oblivion, this was the second of two songs released as singles to support this album - and wasn't ultimately that bad...Unless considered as an In Flames song...Which it needs to be, in which case it seems to take the theatrical approach to song writing that In Flames simply aren't renown for, with the choruses of this song seemingly a bit run of the mill to the extent that Anders inflects the end of it to actually make it sound like a pop song. The other single used to support this album was Rusted Nail, which could've set a benchmark for this album on the whole, as it was a typical Clayman to Reroute to Remain era, with less meaning and heart put into the writing of it.\n\nSeeing as the rules explicitly state we can't do track by track analysis, I can only recommend giving this album a listen and making a judgement call there, go into this open minded towards how Anders portrays himself, and his differing vocal styles and you MIGHT enjoy it, but if you're dead set on hating it, you'll find something to dislike about it. \nNotable tracks are Rusted Nail, Paralyzed and Monsters in the Ballroom.\n",
        "\nMy expectations weren\u2019t very good when I heard that In Flames was releasing a new album called Siren Charms this year, but I had them anyway. They even seemed to grow further when they unveiled the album cover, a simplistic drawing that reminded me of the cover of their 2005 album Come Clarity. And you know a band is really fucked up in their sound when the best you can hope their album to sound like is Come fucking Clarity.\n\nIn Flames is a particular band. Their fame among the metal world is based on the legendary albums they did since Lunar Strain (Or even earlier) to Clayman, albums that became a blueprint in the melodic death metal sound and helped to build the Gothenburg metal scene of the 90s. Their fame also comes from the drastic change in music and sound they did after those albums in their 2002 effort Reroute to Remain, a more mainstream metal and metalcore-oriented approach that made them infamous among a lot of their former fans, and thus giving birth to the \u201cNew Sound\u201d of In Flames we\u2019ve been listening to in the past years. It\u2019s surprising to realize, however, that we\u2019ve been hearing the \u201cNew\u201d In Flames since 2002, 12 years ago, and Lunar Strain was 8 years old when Reroute to Remain was released. That\u2019s right folks, we\u2019ve been listening to the \u201cnew\u201d In Flames for more years than the \u201cold\u201d one now, and their \u201cnew sound\u201d isn\u2019t new at all. It\u2019d be unfair to compare this album to, say, Whoracle, or let alone the Jester Race, when everyone and their mother knows that\u2019s not what In Flames is striving to do these days; so the first thing I reminded myself to do before listening to Siren Charms was not to compare the sound to anything they did before 2002, and instead compare it to the best tracks they\u2019ve done after that year, and judge the album as an album alone.\n\nIt still sucked.\n\nI don\u2019t even know where to begin with this album. The guitars might be the first thing to tackle. Since the departure of Jesper Str\u00f6mblad in 2008, Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte has been in charge of the riff writing of the band. In Flames\u2019 previous album, Sounds of a Playground Fading, did show the giant hole that Str\u00f6mblad had left in the guitar sound, but it also showed some decent riffs here and there that made me think that maybe Gelotte wasn\u2019t that bad at the job as I thought he would be. How wrong I was. The riffs, which once were one of the main attractions of In Flames even on their most recent albums, are now a mess of down-tuned, slow, uncreative, improvised, wannabe heavy \u201cchugga-chugga\u201d riffs that drag down the songs, don\u2019t seem go anywhere and don\u2019t add anything interesting to them, taking the awful \u201cEverything\u2019s Gone\u201d as an example. Songs like \u201cParalyzed\u201d shows that the drums don\u2019t seem to help either. The drum patterns sound like the band was doing some guitar/drum doodle while waiting for their order of pizza to arrive to the studio, decided to record it, add some forgettable lyrics to them and call it a day. I could at least hear some kind of effort in the songwriting of A Sense of Purpose\u2026 And that\u2019s when I realized I was three tracks in and this album was already making me long for an album like A Sense of Purpose. I\u2019m in for one hell of a ride. The keyboards seem to be in the album to stick the other instruments together and make some kind of coherence and melody out of them, like some kind of hearable duct tape that sometimes works and other times makes the whole thing even worse. \n\nLast, and definitely worst, there\u2019s the vocals. As If the instruments hadn\u2019t made the songs bad already, the vocals kill whatever hope there is for them to be interesting; but I think we are to blame for the cringe-inducing vocals found in this album. Maybe we should have told Anders Frid\u00e9n that \u201cSatellites and Astronauts\u201d on Clayman was such a great song not because of the vocals but because of the music around it. Maybe we should have told him that \u201cMy Sweet Shadow\u201d was a good song but it just worked one time and it shouldn\u2019t be used as a mold for all the songs they would do for the next ten fucking years. Maybe we should have told him to stop, for the love of God stop, when he released \u201cCome Clarity\u201d as a single and started to think he could actually sing. Frid\u00e9n sings through all 11 tracks as if he was dying and/or had been anesthetized with thousands of narcotics, always keeping that \u201cOh look at me I\u2019m so deep and artsy\u201d kind of vibe he has had since he started singing off-key years ago, with no kind of technique or sense of musicality whatsoever. He does try to growl in songs like \u201cWhen the World Explodes\u201d and \u201cMonsters in the Ballroom\u201d; two pathetic attempts from the band to to be heavy like the old days, but implementing the awful drumming and riffs I've mentioned earlier. It all ends up sounding like a group of 80-year old men in their underwears trying to ride a skateboard so they can say to their embarrassed teenage neighbors \u201cHey kid, look, we\u2019re still metal! We still got it!\u201d.\n\nThere are some sparks of decency present throughout the album. The guitar solo of \u201cFiltered Truth\u201d is quite acceptable, as is the female-sung part of \u201cWhen the World Explodes\u201d (A part that made me wonder if the album could have been better if the vocals were sung by someone who could actually sing). The Choruses of some songs like \u201cThrough Oblivion\u201d, \u201cDead Eyes\u201d, \u201cMonsters in the Ballroom\u201d \u201cRusted Nail\u201d and \u201cWith Eyes Wide Open\u201d are pretty good as well. But catchy choruses won\u2019t make a song, and the songs as a whole sound like they were written overnight by band members who just have met. These songs are uninspired, completely monotonous, and overall boring. Soundtrack to Your Escape might have been a bad album, but I listened to it from beginning to end without wanting to shut down the computer, break the CD in half, take a flight to Sweden, hunt Anders Frid\u00e9n down and give in to the incontrollable desire to punch him in the face as hard as I humanly can.\n\nI don\u2019t even know who are they trying to please with this album. They certainly will only get laughs from their former melodeath fans, and they won\u2019t please the metalcore part of their fanbase either; and if they\u2019re trying to get into some alternative rock scene with these kind of vocals I can only see failure in their future. This is the sound of a band that sounds bad even by the standards of their (until now) weakest albums, and the sound of some guys who are clearly not even trying to play good music anymore. The catchy riffs, the melodies, the powerful drumming and the at least fitting vocals are all gone. I wish I could say nothing can get worse than Siren Charms, but sadly this band has just proven me that it can, and probably will, try to disappoint even more.\n",
        "\nWhen one approaches an In Flames album, one's expectations should be firmly fixed on hearing something other than a metal album, lest that person has not hear the previous 5 studio LP releases that culminate in this band's post-millennial sound. Contrary to what one might assume, a metal band releasing a non-metal album (or even 6 of them), is not necessarily a precursor to the end of the world, but it's also not immune from being condemned if it's a boring pile of drivel. That is the indictment that the present era of this former pioneering member of the Gothenburg scene has brought itself under, a band that has been put together contrived groove/industrial tinged semi-metal with a strong dose of Emo cliches for the past twelve years and has now firmly planted their flag on it.\n\nIf there is one singular predecessor that Siren Charms can be likened to, it would definitely be that of Soundtrack To Your Escape, which the author of this review considers the worst of this band's post-Clayman duds. The songs heard on here are utterly interchangeable with the same mid-tempo, repetitive, recycled melodic half-ideas that dominated this band's much derided 2004 offering, only here the presentation is just a bit more processed and banal. Anders' whiny clean vocals are at their most annoying, the guitars cycle through a series of heavily predictable riffs that wouldn't make the cut of a Trivium album, and the whole thing just coasts along with very little sense of intrigue. There is plenty of melodrama, but it's presented in a way that makes it comical yet not really very funny.\n\nAs state before, this band's current stock and trade is writing a form of semi-metal, or pseudo-metal if one doesn't want to consider the metallic elements of this sufficient to warrant a partial metal status. The guitar tone definitely hints at where this band was during the lead up to Reroute To Remain, displaying a sort of late 90s crunch, albeit buried under a lot of clean, effects steeped guitar tracks, keyboard additives, and overly present vocals. The intro to \"Everything's Gone\" could possibly pass for a metalcore take on melodeath, particularly the gutted, groovy take that would adorn an All That Remains album. Similarly, there are a few isolated moments on \"Dead Eyes\" where it sound like these guys want to go back to their Colony days, but it's so heavily diluted by meandering alternative rock ballad sections that it ultimately comes to nothing.\n\nTruth be told, this album is actually somewhat better off when it sticks to a purely alternative metal sound, at least from a musical standpoint. There is something bizarrely appealing about what's going on in the extremely straight-forward, structurally pop-oriented song \"Through Oblivion\", which sounds all but like a perfect Breaking Benjamin affair but with keyboards. Of course, what little charm it has is gobbled up by Anders' crappy clean vocals, but there's definitely something here that's a bit more honest than the hack attempts at merging thrash half-thrash riffs with comical metalcore songwriting as heard on \"Monsters In The Ballroom\" and \"When The World Explodes\". That's the other area where this album utterly fails, when it's not being so predictable that it becomes sleep inducing, it's too disjointed and thus becomes equally as unmemorable.\n\nAs much as the detractors will detract and the defenders will defend, the ultimate consequence of this album is a cold indifference. There is no point in offering prospective seekers of an album like this an impassioned warning label to avoid this thing, because the lines are pretty much set regarding who will like this and who will despise it, but suffice to say, anyone who didn't stick with this band after 2001 shouldn't expect anything resembling a change in direction. That's the one thing that is a bit annoying about a lot of the Johnny-Come-Lately types that are just now noticing that this band has gone downhill, this isn't a sudden departure the way Reroute To Remain was, but simply another in an ongoing series of the same sonic slop, served up just a tad bit more rotten this time around. Bon appetit.\n",
        "\nIn Flames is a band that always seems to bring out controversial albums since the early 2000\u2019s and the release of \"Reroute to Remain\". In Flames\u2019 message was already clear with the name of this album. They were changing their sound to remain. This was the first step in a direction that probably no one would have been able to think of. Many years later, the band continues a route they have slowly but surely braved.\n\n\u201cSiren Charms\u201d continues where the last effort was hinting at. On \"Sounds of a Playground Fading\", the band had only started to play a more alternative sound with some electronic samples and some slow songs that have more similarities to the pop or rock genres than to any metal style. In Flames is now about 30% metal music only. Anybody that wants metal and only metal should look elsewhere, this album is miles away from the metal universe. For anybody that likes heavily emotional songs, you will be happy to hear that In Flames is aiming at you. Not to mention that these siren chants have way more variety than many of their other works. \n\nThe album starts with a post-apocalyptic atmosphere in the vein of the last album for easing the transfer between \"Sounds of a Playground Fading\" and \"Siren Charms\". Something already worth noting is the heavily present keyboard as well as the electronic samples that recall \"Soundtrack to your Escape\" and the psychedelic sounds going back to \"Reroute to Remain\" in the first few songs. \n\nThe third song starts to show really what this album is all about. \"Paralyzed\" is a build-up song that has one hell of a paroxysm. It has a very groovy sound with many electronic melodies playing while Anders is singing. These kinds of verses are followed by a chorus that will end this piece on a very epic note. Anders was probably moved a lot by this song and he is coming all out of himself in a desperate cry that is moving me like no other. This song is yet only half heavy because of the build-up itself.\n\nThe album starts an emotional wave where the first three songs are much darker than the rest. The middle section includes much calmer and more uplifting songs like \"With Wide Eyes Open\" and \"Dead Eyes\". About half of these songs have a melancholic tone while the other half transmits a rather uplifting feeling. These two styles complement each other very well and create an album filled with emotional diversity if we take the darker opening tracks into account. \n\nTo conclude, this album can be described with the image of two waves in an grippingly emotional and distorted ocean. It starts with a heavy and mad tone to become sad, calm and beautiful and it finally ends on a heavier but also more positive note. Like I said, this album is more about emotions than a precise style and not a real metal record in the end.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s a tricky business, writing an album with a lot of variation between songs. Variation is to be expected to some extent by a certain point in an artist\u2019s career; it\u2019s a fairly short list of bands that have developed a signature sound and stuck 100% to it over a 20-year-career, and In Flames is no exception to the rule. From the melodic dual guitar approach of their first four albums, to the slower, nu-metal laden post-Colony albums, and even the dabbling in electronica that\u2019s sporadically come and gone since Clayman - In Flames has, by anyone\u2019s measure (and for better or worse), covered a lot of ground since 1993. And in theory it\u2019s not an impossible task, to bring a range of elements together in one album; some artists manage to pull it off fairly well: Tomi Joutsen-era Amorphis has so far managed to sit on a mix of everything from Tales from the Thousand Lakes thru Far from the Sun that fairly successfully not only kept their current fans happy, but also brought many older fans back. Type O Negative\u2019s Dead Again managed to mix \u201cstandards\u201d with tracks that could have been on their first album, ending the band on a rather accidental, poignant high note. Hell, even Metallica have managed it somewhat, baffling as that may be. But has In Flames?\n\nThe simplest, most straightforward answer is \u201cnope, they fucked it up and it sounds awful\u201d. That\u2019s the flipside to writing an album where you try and cover so many styles \u2013 you may end up with a musical CV to be proud of and win acclaim left, right and centre\u2026 but it\u2019s much more likely that you\u2019ll end up with an album that reeks of inconsistency, a complete lack of cohesion between songs, and ultimately, in the attempt to be everything at once, end up being almost nothing. And sadly for In Flames, that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done here.\n\nThis album cannot decide whether it wants to be nu-metal, metalcore, alt-rock a la Tool, or Manson-esque shock rock. None of those are particularly desirable at the best of times, so it\u2019s really not off to a good start. But Korn comparisons have been dogging In Flames for years; they're nothing new and it\u2019s no surprise to hear that they\u2019re here again this time around. There are muted E-chug verses with Friden \u201cwhimpering\u201d over the top throughout (as expected), but it\u2019s all the extra elements that really ruin it: not just from song to song, but within individual songs. Take \u201cEverything\u2019s Gone\u201d, for example: it opens with something fast and \u201cloosely thrashy\u201d, like you\u2019d find on a latter-day Slipknot or Soulfly album\u2026 which lasts for approximately 8 seconds or so before heading into what can only be described as the verse to \u201cWhere the Slime Live\u201d at half speed with Marilyn Manson on vocals. The chorus is pure screamo, and then a short guitar solo appears out of nowhere before heading back to anti-guitar nu-metal chug. Most other tracks follow similar patterns, although a solid chunk of the album is softer; songs like \u201cThrough Oblivion\u201d or \u201cWith Eyes Wide Open\u201d are ballads in a sense \u2013 the distortion on everything from guitars to vocals to overall production distracts, but underneath it all there\u2019s a lot of balladry going on. The end result is a complete mess. The whole is much, much less than the sum of its parts. And there\u2019s the added clincher: its parts are all bad enough on their own. In Flames scratches the surface of every hated nu-metal trope, every open-E metalcore off-beat riff with melodic \u201ctail\u201d, every soft chorus, and so on. It\u2019s a strangely disgusting thing to see: when a band that almost single-handedly pioneered an entire subgenre of music badly imitates bands that took their cues from their own classic material, and shits on it even further to boot. It\u2019s come horribly, terribly full circle.\n\nBut one positive thing to note about the album is the vocals. Friden has never been a singer; his attempts at clean singing in the new millenium have always been the low point of 00s-onwards In Flames (talking of \u201clow points\u201d is fairly redundant when one discusses In Flames), but it seems he\u2019s actually learnt to sing for this album. His cleans are in tune, he has a decent range, and his mimicry is fairly competent \u2013 objectively speaking, Siren Charms will treat you to the sounds of Jonathon Davis, Maynard James Keenan, Marilyn Manson, and the guy from Killswitch Engage, among others. Friden was never anything more than a middle-of-the-road screamer until this point. And to boot: the highest high point of this album is in the song \u201cFiltered Truth\u201d, where he briefly talks underneath the electronicacore like he did in \u201cJotun\u201d or \"Jester Script Transfigured\".\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say why anyone would realistically want to listen to this album. If you like In Flames, even their questionable 00s material, you\u2019d do better to listen to Reroute to Remain than this. Or better yet, indulge yourself! get yourself a sixpack, put Whoracle on, then just sit back and enjoy the melodies.\n",
        "\nFor the last fourteen years it has been a popular trend in the metal scene to bash any new In Flames release because many closed-minded old-school metal heads are still living in the past millennium, unable to turn the page and accept that In Flames is willing to experiment and play a more alternative metal orientated style with a certain mainstream touch. Instead of giving up on the band, these self-declared true elitists still expect the band to return to a genre it has pioneered and importantly improved during the first ten years of its career. I\u2019m completely on In Flames\u2019 side because it\u2019s useless to keep on reproducing music the band has already played in a nearly perfect manner on its great debut record \u201cLunar Strain\u201d. Instead of becoming an irrelevant copy of its former years, the band has experimented for the majority of its career over the past fourteen years. In Flames continues to do so and the new album is another big slap in the face of those grown old nostalgics. And that\u2019s the way it has to be.\n\nEnter Siren Charms. This record is as experimental as \u201cA Sense Of Purpose\u2026\u201d but less accessible than this release and continues the style of the previous effort \u201cSounds Of A Playground Fading\u201d with a few electronic and modern alternative rock influences influenced by \u201cSoundtrack To Your Escape\u201d. The great thing is that the progressively fusions and continues its very own sound without copying any particular record to extent.\n\nThis record still includes quite a few surprises. The dirty, fast and misanthropic \u201cEverything\u2019s Gone\u201d could come straight from a Marilyn Manson record and is definitely one of the best songs on here. \n\nThe slow and plodding \u201cThrough Oblivion\u201d has a modern gothic rock style I would expect from a band like HIM. Once again, if you like this kind of music as much as I do, you are going to worship this song as well. \n\nThe melancholic and floating \u201cWith Eyes Wide Open\u201d with its crystal clear fragile vocals and its catchy chorus reminds me of Thirty Seconds To Mars. \u201cDead Eyes\u201d hits a very similar way and comes around with so beautiful guitar and keyboard melodies that this track should definitely be the second single. In this song, In Flames sing: \u201cThis is my world now.\u201d And they sing with as much conviction as Metallica did on the song \u201cMy World\u201d on the album \u201cSt. Anger\u201d. Many people call Siren Charms In Flames\u2019 personal \u201cSt. Anger\u201d. Even though these two records are miles away from each other stylistically, this comparison is not completely wrong. Both bands do what they want to do with passionate authenticity and unbowed power and don\u2019t care about being popular. That\u2019s why I like both records quite a lot. Some people will call the two aforementioned tracks emo rock but it is performed with this certain conviction and passion and that\u2019s why these songs have really grown on me. \n\n\u201cWhen The World Explodes\u201d starts like a mixture of a metalcore and a melodic death metal song that could have appeased the old fan base. But In Flames wouldn\u2019t be themselves if they didn\u2019t include a couple of controversial elements in this song and just thinking of the stupid faces of the extreme metal elitists makes me enjoy this track. Its second part features soft and enchanting female vocals and highly atmospheric and floating electronic elements. In Flames shows one of its most creative song writing capacities in this track. \n\nThe first single \u201cRusted Nail\u201d includes it all. Longing guitar solos, melancholic and fragile clean vocals that sound better on each album, depressive lyrics and an extremely liberating, majestic and melodic chorus you won\u2019t get out of your mind. This is the kind of song that continues the style of the previous record. Imagine a mixture of \u201cSounds Of A Playground Fading\u201d and \u201cLiberation\u201d. This is where In Flames shows its consistency and how their albums logically build up on each other. \n\nAlbum closer \u201cFiltered Truth\u201d comes around with mechanical vocal effects and opening guitar riffs that make me think of Billy Talent. I mean how cool is that? The short passionate chorus simply blows me away once again. The consistent song without one unnecessary second is crowned by a melodic but twisted instrumental bridge. This track ends a very good album on a high note. Hello, third single!\n\nIn the beginning, I thought a couple of songs on this album were a little bit hard to digest or unspectacular at certain moments such as the short title song \u201cSiren Charms\u201d and the \u201cMonsters In The Ballroom\u201d that recalls several modern melodic death metal songs from the past three In Flames releases. Even these average tracks have grown on me after three spins. It\u2019s hard to tell if I like this record as much as \u201cSounds Of A Playground Fading\u201d in hindsight but my first impressions are pretty much as positive as they were three years earlier. So please don\u2019t give a damn about rude comments on social media or average scores on the Metal Archives that may drop below forty percent this time. If you liked In Flames\u2019 previous records and don\u2019t mind the experiments described above, you have to purchase this record. By the way, the two bonus tracks \u201cThe Chase\u201d and \u201cBecome The Sky\u201d are excellent modern melodic death metal as well that should even please to a couple of fans that liked \u201cA Sense Of Purpose\u201d but none of the other recent releases, so be sure to look out for them. There is no doubt that this release will easily make it on my list of the twenty best records of the year 2014. Right now, this album is even in my top five. Be courageous and check this out. In Flames we trust.\n",
        "\nAs one of the more notable and previously reputable of melodic-death metal bands, In Flames commenced their career with music that rightfully earned them the status of a defining metal band. However, as time progressed, their style of music has changed, and in the opinions of many, degraded heavily. I for one, agree completely. From one of the the bands I would personally place amongst one of my favourite metal bands, to now an accomplice in the diminishing of metal's contemporary quality. There are many contemporary music groups amongst today's metal scene and newer genres that compose relatively good music for what they are, however In Flames is not one of them in my opinion.\n\nHowever, I can proudly say that \"Clayman\" sits amongst my favourite melodic death metal albums of all time. The lyrical themes and superb vocals truly amalgamate an atmosphere of nostalgia and wonder. The use of acoustic guitar and frequently tranquil vocals contrasted amongst the truly talented harsh vocals of Anders Friden make this album very memorable indeed.\n\nI have heard many bands attempt to replicate their style, however none do so as well as In Flames on this album. 'Bullet Ride' commences the album, as truly a speedy induction into the fury of this album, and I found myself being swayed by the use of guitar in the verses, progressing into a very melodic riff for the bridge and chorus. This song truly conveys what I perceive as a good melodic death metal. \n\nAnother favourite track on this album is the song 'Pinball Album', beginning with a headbanging riff, and a thumping first verse. The chorus of clean vocals truly contrasts against the ferocity of the vocals, with some remnants of a punk theme in the chorus. \n\n'Satellites and Astronauts' begins with a truly talented and beautiful clean guitar intro, subsequently introducing a melodic shredded guitar riff, very epic to say the least. This song's first verse follows in the footsteps of the first track 'Bullet Ride' very much, however maintains its originality. Once again, the harsh vocals are juxtaposed against the clean and whispered vocals of the verses. \n\n'Suburban Me' basically places a shrieked vocal part over a very catchy and memorable guitar riff and melody, completely formulating a 10/10 track, however not as memorable as the first 3 tracks I've listed in this review.\n\nUltimately, this album truly encapsulates the quality of a perfect melodic death metal album, and the genius of In Flames' earlier works. Alongside 'Colony' and 'Whoracle', In Flames deserve their title as a prominent and achieved band; however their change of music style in my opinion is truly a shame. Yet their quality of work on this album is more than what most bands could ever hope to achieve, and this album in my opinion truly contributed to the melodic-death metal scene as a template for what is defined as a successful and original album in terms of innovation.\n",
        "\nI'm aware a lot of people don't like post 2000 In Flames. They sold out. They stopped using guitar harmonies. Too much keyboards usage. Anders' voice. Production criticism, metalcore/groove influence. It sounds like Korn....i've heard it all, i've seen the score here on Metal Archives and i'm still going to have to disagree with some of the grievances people have with this band and this album in particular.\n\nThis album was the first In Flames album i bought. I'd heard some earlier stuff and liked it so i bought the first new album i could, this one. I wasn't amazed by it, never have been, but there's a certain charm to this especially when you're unfamiliar with most of the band's previous output.\n\nThe problem with music fans is they don't like change. It's ok to like different styles but if a band moves from one to another then it's blasphemy. I'm not totally defending IF here, they undoubtedly changed to a more Americanised, accessible sound. Did they make more money from it? Yes. Do they sell more albums and tickets and live a more comfortable life now? Yes. Do they care if the comparably small melodic death fans hate them? Probably not. \n\ni will agree there is too much keyboard use on here, i'd much rather have the famed guitar harmonies of old. This still has tasteful melodic soloing, but very little harmony use. As for influences of other genres, there's definitely other forces at play here yet this still sounds somewhat unique, not like the band blatantly ripping off someone else. Bass is thick sounding but uninteresting, drums are decent enough for this midpaced style. Anders sounds better on here than on Reroute to Remain, but he sounds like shit on that album. Not a great performance here but i can just about accept it. But no, he doesn't sound like bloody Korn!\n\nAs for the songs themselves, it's pretty hit and miss. 'F(r)iend' is ok. I hated 'The Quiet Place' on first listen but i suppose it's alright as far as commercial metal songs go. Second single 'Touch of Red' is pure rubbish though. 'My Sweet Shadow' is pretty good but i can see why people would hate it. Same goes for the token ballad 'Evil in a Closet' which has a nice melodic solo but will agitate fans of the old, harsher style. After that it's a straightforward pattern of bad song, decent song. \n\nThis album's major drawbacks are the songs all sounding very similar, awkward vocals, excessive keyboards, poor lyrics and stupid song titles. This makes it sound like a terrible album that deserves all the scorn it has received. Truth be told, i still enjoy an occasional listen to this. It isn't great, but it has just enough good songs to keep me listening, as well as reminding me of my younger days and my first forays into melodic death metal (i didn't know this wasn't melodeath at the time!) Fans of the old style should probably avoid this unless they happen to like modern American metal too.\n",
        "\nOriginality in songwriting is so much on here and I think it's In Flames' best, but it really did lack a solid production quality sound. If it was better, then my rating would be 100%. There is nothing (to me) boring about this release. It is riff-tastic and a extremely high quality written melodic death metal album. There is a combination of heavy C-toned guitar work flavored with some clean melodies and an instrumental. I'd have to say that riff-wise it's In Flames' best written album to date. So many would contest this based on checking over the scores it received, but I'd say In Flames' selective recreation of their reality based on their Gothenburg style of melodic death shined with vigor.\n\nThe music here is top notch like no other featuring heavy bar chord riffs meshed with many different melodies that are played alongside them with precision. I would have to say that I preferred \"Gyroscope\" and \"Episode 666\" to be the best tracks on here. However, every song has amazing melodies (as is being discussed) and I would consider this album to be highly underrated. I don't think it is at all overrated and those who heard that on here would conclude that this is an amazing release. I don't think that In Flames could've topped this out of any album that they have released from the past to present dates.\n\nLead guitar work was quite impressive and perfective all over the fretboard, so simply amazing! The vocals did not vary that much, mostly high end screaming with some clean which went alongside the clean guitar bits. They (the vocals) really suited the guitar well and did not drown out the music. The deluxe edition features bonuses which were really a good complimentary addition to the main album. I'd say that other than the production quality not being their best it lacked not only there, but also in the mixing, the bass guitar was a little hard to hear. The drums went well along with the music and fit in with the mild/moderate tempos and licks.\n\nEverything was right in queue with this monumental album, my favorite out of their entire discography. It did have that aggression (as previously discussed), but not very fast tempos and their cover of Depeche Mode's \"Everything Counts\" was very well played out. No complaints on that end. Really don't expect them to be explosive here guitar wise and with severe tempo changes. The album showed very good musicianship lyrically, melody wise and aura inspiring. I'd say it'd be easier to listen to more often if the album was totally remastered very much like Death's remastered releases.\n\nBottom line, if you're highly into melodic death metal, this one is not an album to pass up. Yes it has a few flaws, but overall the quality is there and riff work was highly respected by me as a listener. If you're not convinced, check out those tracks that I mentioned plus \"Jotun\" and \"Food For the Gods.\" In summation, In Flames stuck real quality in this album. I don't think that it's highly overrated Gothenburg metal, I'd say that it's up there in the way that At the Gates' \"Slaughter of the Soul\" is, so own it then you can be your own critic and establish your own value judgment on it. So near utmost perfection!\n",
        "\nFew artists could ever claim to have left such a lasting stamp on a genre as In Flames have on the melodic death metal genre since their inception in 1990, and not without good reason. This was the band that released Clayman, the mighty Whoracle, Lunar Strain, Colony and their opus The Jester Race. The band was initially formed as the side project of then-Ceremonial Oath bassist Jesper Stromblad as an outlet for his more melodically-oriented writing style that did not fit his primary band of the time. Come 1993, the situation had changed and Stromblad had quit that particular band and recruited a line-up to write and record a debut album under the In Flames band. Following this the band grew tired of using session musicians for vocals and Jesper playing drums on the album, and so they recruited the final members of their line-up and set about recording and then releasing The Jester Race in 1995.\n\nThis is an album that has no intention of taking its foot off of the listeners throat despite its melodic nature. The guitar tones are exceedingly heavy and the vocals are aggressive; the riffs bludgeoning and the drumming cool and calculated but still carrying a lot of rage behind it throughout. As far as complete band performances go The Jester Race ranks right up there among the best albums, with every member of the band consistently contributing something good that adds to the overall mood of the album. The guitars create a dark atmosphere that the demonic vocals from new recruit Anders Friden perfectly compliment with a lot of aggression behind them. Jesper also contributes acoustic guitars on this release which add a lot of diversity to it and draw up a gloomy picture, particularly on the opening song Moonshield. This five minute masterpiece was the perfect way to open up the album, with the acoustic guitar being used more than once to great effect including as the introduction to the song. The way the band transition from accompanying acoustic guitar work to electric guitar work is also something to marvel at; with the acoustic sections feeling suitably relaxed whilst the heavy parts are barbaric and yet somewhat restrained, keeping to a slow pace.\n\nEach and every song on The Jester Race is one that leaps out with its own characteristics and yet still contributing to the overall flow of the album. The instrumental number The Jester's Dance shows off just how well the band can nail the soft to heavy dynamic, whilst Graveland shows off a much faster side to the band at times. The guitar work varies from the slow and sludgy to the lightning fast and the vocals aggressive whilst the drums constantly adapt to the meandering pace. This album makes great use of slightly more progressive song structures than what some death metal fans may be unaccustomed to with some frequently altering tempos and it is clear that In Flames really strived to make their mark on metal music with this release. This is arguably their most ambitious and complete-sounding release, although some might give that title to any of their first five releases. The pacing and flow of The Jester Race is completely unmatched, with every song feeling complete no matter what the length whilst the longer tracks (of which non stretches far past the five minute mark) never feel over-stretched, such is the genius behind the song writing.\n\nThe Jester Race is the perfect example of flawlessly executed melodic death metal with some angry vocal work, thought-provoking lyrics and great riffing and the cool use of acoustic guitars mixed perfectly among the heaviness. The production job is crisp and the drumming and bass work merely completes the rout. If you have not heard this then I highly recommend it as In Flames proved on here that they are more than a cut above the average Gothenburg band.\n",
        "\nPrelude\n\nNobody has a reputation and following quite like In Flames. Jesper Stromblad formed the band with a vision of blending death metal with Iron Maiden-style harmonies, brought it to life by borrowing members from other bands, created a unique sound by writing with the band as a third guitarist while playing drums live. Their first album was as disorganized as the band's lineup at the time, but it was an interesting and revered combination of harmony-filled death metal, with folk songs and passages and the odd inclusion of a violin at times, several steps closer to mastering the inclusion of that instrument than At The Gates, who reportedly only included violinist Jesper Jarold on their debut when a public image campaign in Sweden required all metal bands to have a member named Jesper. \n\nFrom there, band underwent a transformation from side project to full-time band, creating an EP that even naysayers of their style often admit to enjoying - these sessions utilized two drummers and five vocalists who weren't on the debut and would be out of the picture by the next album. Tired of the revolving door, the band established a stable lineup in 1995.\n\nFrom there, the band pinned down their classic style, a heavily layered, extremely melodic version of heavy/power metal with low tuned guitars and a growling vocalist. For their next album, they stripped down the sound to be more aggressive and rely on fewer layers, with more string skipping like their peers At The Gates. Following some lineup shifts, they took a turn back towards their 80s roots with some keyboards and a hammond organ on their next release, starting to give the vocalist a bit of room to expand from a monotone. From there, they successfully reinvented their style one last time, aided by a legendary production job with one of the thickest guitar sounds on a palatable metal album, and ushered in a new Swedish sound, something that would come to be hated as it was never as good as the first time, only a bastardization of those serene songs that those bastards from Gothenburg once played. \n\nWhile the band had not completely reinvented itself from one album to the next, they took so many of the right steps to stay close to home but offer a different outlook each time. This reputation followed them for years to come, knowing that a band who had so much great material to fall back on could always revisit portions of it and come away with something good. As Nuclear Blast signed In Flames clones from Germany and bands flocked to Studio Fredman for \"the sound\", In Flames opted for a change of wardrobe, building makeshift studios in a rented house overseas, and most fans these days refer to a spiritual change known as \"being dead inside\". \n\nThe band phased out their old material citing the need for songs that were written for two guitarists, and they stripped down their once elegant arrangements to the point where the chugging and grooves were unaccompanied by melodies most of the time, only the increasingly wretched shrieks of their vocalist, who was born again at the turn of the millennium and believed that he could sing. The band did not abandon their old sound, rather they used its elements sparingly and spoke of them as a touch of the old stuff. \n\nThe band's legacy followed them in an odd way. With each coming album, their older fans appeared increasingly delusional about the band having some sort of return to form. They donned all-white outfits along with fellow Swedes Soilwork as they both released breakout albums in 2002. When they began rotating normal clothing back into their wardrobes on the second round of touring in support of this album, fans thought they were going to take a turn in direction. The frontman got his nu-metal out through a side project, Passender. Like the title of a song on their previous record, the band started a free fall and their next album was even more atrocious. \n\nThen the band announced their intent to self-produce their next album. Surely they had tired of the synths dominating their sound, and with two guitarists producing, they would put out something like a catchier version of Clayman. Nope. It wasn't as bad as the last one, so that must be an upswing, right? The keyboards were used a bit more sparingly (much like fats, oils, and sweets are used sparingly in the American diet) so that meant they wanted to write more guitar-oriented music again, right? The guitarists even mentioned that they wanted to focus on the guitars more, more like the old stuff. For some reason, the band continued to suggest, here and there, that they had \"the old stuff\" in mind, which meant something very different to them and to the fans of the old stuff, some of whom still had hope in the band. \n\nTheir next album was more guitar-oriented, the music backed off the keyboards, and it was a lot better than the few before it. It was still nothing like the In Flames of days past, but they were headed in a better direction. Following this album, the last remaining founder of the band, Jesper Stromblad, announced his departure. Cue wild speculation. Perhaps losing him was the kick in the ass the band needed to get out of this awful groove, in more ways than one. The band wouldn't add another guitarist for the next album, though we all knew that perennial fill-in Niklas Engelin would get the job. Not welcoming him into the fold immediately suggested that they wanted something other than the nu-metal stylings of his other band, Engel. \n\n...and then they announced the title of the album, and the whole world thought of the cover of Korn's self-titled debut. \n\n-\n\nA child runs through the playground pulling an unusual balloon by a ribbon. The ribbon, wrapped tightly around the child's hand, is also wrapped tightly around the lips of a frog, inflated with helium until it is round and buoyant in the air. The child climbs a ladder, still clutching the ribbon. Upon reaching the highest point on the playground, the child falls to the ground and pulls the ribbon so hard that it comes off of the frog. The helium-filled frog begins croaking, droning as it flies around like a deflating balloon. No, this is just an illusion, a wish that a once mighty band did not fall from the top and roll around in the dirt while their vocalist crooned like helium-filled frog. A dream that the band's once amazing logo had not been replaced by one with text written inside monkey bars, replaced by a stock font, replaced by some scratch that looks like a child's handwriting. Oh, the writing was on the wall, the writing was on the album cover before this one, we should have known. \n\n-\n\nThree major problems arise amidst a myriad of problems that constitute the problem that is this album. The band tried to make a vocal-driven album and they don't have the personnel to manage it. There are too many keyboards for a band without a keyboard player, and they write songs that use them as a crutch or a veil. I know the band are huge fans of Rush, but I no longer have the faith that In Flames can return to form from their crappy keyboard albums. Finally, the bread and butter of In Flames, the guitar riffs, have ceased to be, replaced by a descendant, the derivative of a derivative of the real In Flames. \n\nIn Flames stated that they intended to make a vocal-driven album. In theory, that could work if their vocalist could sing, but Anders Friden's croaky crooning can only work as a percussive counterpart to melodic guitars. Long gone are the emotive monotone growls with three guitar parts layered over them. The third guitar is long gone too, and the guitars often lay back with power chords to leave room for vocals and keyboards. Their past success stories were largely in part due to great guitar work giving the vocals a narrow range to work within. The sliding half-growls worked for a while, finding a compromise between a monotone and attempting to carry a melody. It just doesn't work here. \n\nIf there was a time for In Flames to make an album with lots of clean singing, it was around 1994, when they had a vocalist who could actually sing. \n\nThe keyboards are another problem. \u00d6rjan \u00d6rnkloo has been playing keyboards on every In Flames album for the past decade, with the keyboards becoming increasingly involved in the music, minus a slight dip on the previous album. Although the keyboards are a huge part of the modern In Flames sound, they don't have a keyboard player in the band, and they seem to write songs without a keyboard player being involved. The result of this are synths filling the space, trying to compensate for the inability of the vocals and replace the melodic driving force that the guitars stopped providing a while ago. The synths never take the lead, they don't have their own place in the music like their counterparts Dark Tranquillity integrated quite well a bit earlier than In Flames. Synths fill out the wall of sound as an afterthought to compensate for what the rest of the music can't do. \n\nThere was a time when In Flames used keyboards well, fitting them into the music of Colony, giving them some of their own sections as well as some backing time, while still keeping the focus of the album on melodic guitar riffs. \n\nWhat happened to the guitars? In Flames appear to be in a constant battle to reduce the role of guitars in their music. In the early days they had three guitarists, down to two while using three guitar tracks per song, sometimes with additional harmonies. Over the years they stripped the guitar parts down to rarely include a third, then began to use both guitars in unison while adding keyboards over the top. The departure of Jesper Stromblad did not help at all, with the guitars only pulling out of power chord mode to play harmonies as the tail of riffs, or as a fill. I understand that the point of this record was to leave things wide open for the vocalist to take the lead. That was a poor choice. \n\nRather than the complex layers of melodies and harmonies that most people knew as the In Flames sound, the occasional leads here are thin, basic harmonies that sound more like throwaway riffs of the In Flames wannabes of a decade ago - those that earned unkind-sounding labels like \"Gothencore\". The melodies and harmonies are no longer an integral part of the riffs, and the riffs are no longer the style that everyone with two ears loves the band for. The guitar playing is a bunch of mid-paced chugging interspersed with unimaginative harmonized leads. \n\nIn Flames used to write great guitar riffs and let them carry the music. Apparently they are content to leave that behind even if it means that they put out a laughably bad album. \n\nThis same band once had vivid lyrics of their fantasy world, cryptic hymns of astronomy and mythology. Anders Friden crafted those concepts and the lyrics were penned by Niklas Sundin. Once Anders had a stronger grip on the English language, he moved on to writing introspective, personal lyrics. While I prefer the earlier lyrics, the latter of those were acceptable and helped shape the concept of the Clayman album. Some of the lyrics on this album aren't as bad as others, but it doesn't get much worse than the childish prose of \"The Attic\":\n\n\"There's someone in the attic / Building a strange machine / Never really seen him / But I think he works all day\nBlinded by the world outside / I stay inside / Hardly know my name / But it's getting better by time\nI saw something in the mirror / Someone's watching me / If I hide in the attic / They will never get to me\nFound some rope on the floor / I have to build a trap / So I start on my machine / I am never to be seen\n\nThis album also continues a practice that the band begun when they named an album \"Reroute To Remain\" - they started by leaving a not-so-subtle hint that their shift in style would be be reverted while penning songs such as \"Dismiss the Cynics\" - and on this album Anders penned his least eloquent lyrics since \"lost my visual 'cause all you fucks are in my way\":\n\n\"I say goodbye to you all at once / (I) don't dare to face you all alone.\nI went from wreckage to world class / With a box of t-shirts and some records to sell,\nBut times have changed - I have to defend my actions. / The foundation crumbles and I have to leave.\nThanks for everything - I couldn't ask for more... / I say I love you all... as I vanish through the Jester's Door\"\n\nIf these lyrics hadn't been so honest and straight forward, spoken over some awful new age techno, I would think this was the wreckage. Thanks for defending your actions, I am honestly glad that you made a good living for yourselves after you put out some great albums, and I have some lyrics to suggest for the next In Flames album:\n\n\"First five were world class / Next five sucked ass\nCouldn't make it on hard work / So we dressed up with Soilwork\nStopped writing metaphors / Instead wrote a song called Metaphor\nOur last founder tired of songcraft / So he quit the band to play World of Warcraft.\"\n",
        "\nAs far as sellout albums go, this is pretty high calibre. It\u2019s a lot easier to listen to polarizing albums like this with a breadth of distance. I can understand In Flames fans feeling betrayed at the time of this album\u2019s release, but come on, it was 2002 and that\u2019s just where popular metal was at during the turn of the century. In Flames aren\u2019t trying to pass this sound off as something that it\u2019s not, which might be a misconception for many people. This isn\u2019t melodic death metal at all. This is slightly heavier Linkin Park with catchier choruses, and in some cases, less lame lyrics. It\u2019s pretty shameless crap, to be sure, but it\u2019s undeniably fun at the same time, if only for a sense of dumb novelty.\n\nYou could tell In Flames were flirting with some of these ideas on Clayman, but Reroute to Remain definitely kicks the synth pop-metal aesthetic to new regions. What\u2019s remarkable is how successful this mindless approach to songwriting sometimes is, and yet In Flames have gone on to fuck it up over and over in subsequent years, and that\u2019s not even to say it works all the time on this album. Take the song Trigger, which is one of the biggest hits on this album. It might as well be void of content other than a ridiculously infectious chorus.\n\nCollect some stars to shine for you\nStart today there are only a few\u2026\n\nMmm, now doesn\u2019t that just pull on your heartstrings like a Swedish boy band playing at your wedding? System is basically a typical fast In Flames song cast into a fairly generic metalcore mould. It\u2019s not very memorable, but actually picks up steam in the second half when it slows down for another angry white boy chorus. Egonomic is in a similar style; fast for the sake of speed but unfortunately with even less substance. Cloud Connected is the blueprint for the nu-In Flames concert hit with its building synth intro and spoken-screamed verses and of course a chorus that would have hordes of prepubescents stage-rushing at Knotfest. Even Dawn of a new Day manages to prove itself worthwhile, despite being \u2018that acoustic track\u2019.\n\nIf albums like this ruin metal for you then it\u2019s only because you let them. Aggressively berating this stuff is akin to a senile pensioner who spends his afternoons shouting \u201cback in my day, video games were called books!\u201d to kids who just ignore him anyway. What surprises me is the fact that In Flames squandered the simple formula they scored with on this album in later misfortunes such as A Sense of Purpose. How hard can it be to keep churning out hits like Cloud Connected? It\u2019s true that I find it a bit grating to stomach this album in its entirety these days, but it was an important one for me in my formative years, and I\u2019m definitely still able to find enjoyment in its shameless bombast.\n",
        "\nEven though moments of In Flames\u2019 back catalogue are very close to my heart, I\u2019ve never felt like a typical In Flames fan. I\u2019m not blind to their mishaps, and I don\u2019t feel fervently compelled to act as an apologist to their detractors. More to the point, though, I\u2019ve never understood how virtually the entire metal community is comfortable in drawing a line directly down their discography (almost always between Clayman and Reroute to Remain) and insisting on a split between \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d, as if there were actually such a clear signifier. I can understand how easy a dismissal this is for most of the metal community, but I call it unfounded horseshit. If an album like Reroute to Remain completely caught you off guard then apparently you weren\u2019t paying attention to begin with. Their sound was synth-drenched and poppy before that and Only for the Weak still probably remains their most jump-da-fuck-up song, and if you don\u2019t jump-da-fuck up for it then you don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you. \n\nIn reality, every single In Flames release sounds quite singular. Despite having not listened to a whole lot of them in the past few years, if you played me a three second clip of any In Flames song I would instantly be able to tell you which album it comes from, even if I couldn\u2019t name the song itself. The fact that people so listlessly dump Reroute to Remain and Come Clarity into the same bucket as Soundtrack to Your Escape, and, even the possibly more abhorrent, A Sense of Purpose, truly baffles me. Come Clarity, which essentially sounds like later era At the Gates playing Blink 182 power ballads; a combination which looks hideous on paper, is somehow compelling in execution. No, it\u2019s not an artistic achievement worthy of worship, but why should it be looked as such? It\u2019s mindless fun, and when you keep in mind that In Flames is playing for their target audience of fourteen year old Ozzfest kids, it makes total sense. \n\nUnfortunately, for their tenth endeavour, Sounds of a Playground Fading, they\u2019ve opted to simply continue where they left off with A Sense of Purpose and put out another album that sounds like if Simon Cowell manufactured a Hollywood boy band and told them to play heavy metal. I can get behind albums like Reroute and Come Clarity because, despite being pop albums, at least you can tell that the band kind of is, or at least once was, metal. The kind of shit we\u2019re dealing with on albums like this, though, try to pass off metal as something that it\u2019s not; and in doing so, disgrace the genre they\u2019re cashing in on. It\u2019s a disaster of the formula with a guitar tone so flaccid it\u2019s simply depressing. You\u2019d think it would be pretty easy to churn out sappy techno-metal hits when you wrote Cloud Connected ten years prior, but the attempt here is pitiful. Deliver Us has a quirky little synth intro that leads to nowhere except mindless chugs. And to think I used to really like Bjorn as a guitarist. Why In Flames have taken this lamentable route for the second album in a row is beyond me, since they\u2019d already nailed their pop-metal formula ages ago. A New Dawn manages to be the only song that sticks out with its surprisingly memorable guitarwork. It\u2019s kind of a testament to the fact that even at their most haphazard and uninspired, they\u2019re still able to get it right by coincidence.\n\nWhat I won\u2019t do is give you a lengthy account of how Anders Friden ruins a potentially good album, because every scathing In Flames review you\u2019ll read will focus much too disproportionally on his performance. The picture painted of him by most people is essentially that of a demented dictator, the sole figure in In Flames\u2019 sellout. What can I possibly say about him that hasn\u2019t been said already? Maybe this: he isn\u2019t the problem, though of course he\u2019s part of it. Even if Friden was at his best, there\u2019s no saving what\u2019s already not there. The lyrics, however, are the aspect that\u2019s come to surprise me most him. Is this the same man who penned the poems of Colony? \n\nWe're running out of time\nCan't seem to recognize\nWhat put us here in the first place\nCounting down the days\nbeginning of the end\n\nUgh. I thought In Flames would be content in finding their niche as the metalhead\u2019s Killswitch Engage, but I can\u2019t even guess what they\u2019re trying to get at now. It really sounds as though they\u2019re scared of playing metal, but are being forced to by an outsider.\n",
        "\nI'd have to say that this is a \"happier\" sounding In Flames piece of work. The riffs are much better than they were on \"Colony\". They're heavier, more memorable, better constructed, and everything seemed to fit better song-wise on this release. It's less aggressive as I stated, but that doesn't take away from the magic that this album portrays. Similar lyrical topics i.e. astronomy and fantasy, yet they blended well with the guitar. This release is anything but half assed.\n\nThe production quality is also much better than their previous releases especially the bass guitar. They do a little more experimenting on this album, but it doesn't take away from the overall release as a whole. The guitars again are tuned way down and are thick with heavy distortion. They do incorporate some clean guitar parts on here, not overly much though. Their melodic death roots are heavily portrayed here and that I can't stress enough.\n\nIt's a less aggressive album than their previous releases even with Anders screams, they're not as intense and more clearly heard out which makes it easier to make out what he's saying. This one has to be a favorite of theirs because of their innovation and creativity/experimentation on here. Again there are harsh and clean vocals. However, for the most part, Anders' screaming is as I've stated less intense and fits the music perfectly. This to me is their last monumental release. Everything afterwards doesn't sound like them at all.\n\nOut of all the In Flames albums I've heard in the past, this one has definitely the best overall production quality. Nothing is left out i.e. none of the instruments are poorly mixed in together and everything seems so balanced. To me, it's an album that I can't really get sick of. Other critics may disagree, but I'd have to say that every song on here deserves praise. \"Brush the Dust Away\" is probably my favorite track, but like I said, all of the songs are good.\n\nJust YouTube some of the tracks on here especially if you're into melodic death and judge for yourself. After this album, they should have disbanded, not sold out. It's actually a release that you can appreciate every time that you hear it. It's anything but dark and depressing. A very good vibe to each song and the guitars are so superb. I'm surprised that they were actually able to write all of the material on this album within about a year's time.\n\nThe deluxe addition features some bonus tracks and other material. If you want something to put you in a good mood, then listen to this album. Like I previously said, it's their \"happier\" version of melodic death. Nothing falls short here and all of the melodies are just perfect. A challenge to play these riffs if you're a guitar player. They are once again lower tuning and the lead guitar work is amazing. Way better than on \"Colony\". I'd have to say a lot of preparation and getting things exact on this recording.\n\nTremendous musicianship on this album and the most memorable songs that they could have entrenched on here. If you like melodic death metal, then pick this one up ASAP. It really is amazing, I'd say the best work that they could have ever done. Nothing disturbs me here, it's just everything after this album that is the pits. That's why I stressed their abandoning the melodic death roots really turned me off on this band. Instead of continuously getting better and better with each release, they threw it all away with their newer style.\n",
        "\nFollow-up from the classic \"Whoracle\" release back in 1997, \"Colony\" has a little bit of a better recording quality than it's previous output, but the guitar riffs aren't as memorable. The throat is still high-end screaming by Anders which definitely fits the music, both clean tone rhythm guitar and heavier crunch tone distortion. A lot of the songs feature a combination of the 2 types of guitar work with a different tuning than \"Whoracle\". Instead of being in C, they are in A#.\n\nThere is less lead guitar work and more of a focus on milder tempos including acoustic medleys with a lot of aura behind them. I'd say that after their next album entitled \"Clayman\", I lost interest in the band because they changed their style of music too much to the point to where I'd just want to say that they (like many other bands) sold out. I don't feel that way about \"Colony\" because it's still within the melodic death metal category. Even though there are some songs with clean throat also, they still maintained themselves into being true to their roots.\n\nThe guitar riffs are at a milder tempo, but they still have some aggression behind the music whereas on \"Clayman\", it's a little \"happier\" sounding. Noteworthy guitars, same lyrical concepts i.e. astronomy and fantasy, plus music that only features solid melodic death metal. This album is slower than \"Whoracle\" in terms of the tempos, but like I previously said a solid release within the metal genre. A lot of chord progressions, some tremolo picked riffing (but not as much as \"Whoracle\"), and a milder vibe to the music.\n\n\"Whoracle\" was way more noteworthy than this one and I was surprised that it got a lower overall rating than \"Colony\". It was probably due to the recording quality (like I said) and a more solid drum work than it's predecessor. I'd have to say that I liked \"Whoracle\" more, but I'm not saying that it's a total waste to pick up this album for yourself. It's definitely vintage In Flames, just milder and still featuring some form of aggression to the music.\n\nIn summation, \"Colony\" is definitely an album get if you're a melodic death metal freak like me. As I previously stated, it's not as noteworthy as \"Whoracle\", but it's still good musical outputs and overall musicianship by the band. Strange tuning on the guitars though, but they still kick butt with the rhythms. I think that a combination of clean/distorted guitar riffing was well put out here, but not as good as \"Whoracle\" or even before that \"The Jester Race\".\n",
        "\nOh yeah, motherfuckers... Ten years have passed since In Flames released this album. Nevertheless, aside from very harsh criticism, this could've been a good album, if it wasn't for some things. You know, this is not your typical melodeath album, where some vocalist screams/growls over some Iron Maiden/Morbid Angel-influenced guitar riffs, while the bassist plays his part and the drummer keeps the rhythm while alternating between the savage death-metal drumming and the fine and expressive metal rhythms. This album screams from the fucking bottom of his lungs (if it really does have any?) :\"Buy me stupid american consumer, who doesn't know shit about melodic death metal or metal in general!!!\". \n\nWe all know that americans (like any other nation, where 70% of the population has a TV in the house) tend to embrace the sheep-like behavior. When everyone else buys some stupid and worthless product, that is very well promoted, they feel empty and buy the turd. This happened with the now \"seminal\" (in a bad way) \"Reroute to Remain\". There's just a little problem with this comparison... \"Reroute to Remain\" is not so stupid and worthless like some shitty over-promoted product. It actually became an epitome. An epitome of what a commercial album should sound like and how a metal band should approach the infamous goal of \"gettin' rich\". What is weird about this album is that the band didn't embrace some trend, like we see nowadays (ultra-good death metal bands turning deathcore... *cough* Cryptopsy *cough*), to do this thing...They actually created one! They are like the Metallica of melodic death metal. They helped create the genre with a ton of creativity and the guts to mix the sheer awesomness and melodic complexity of NWOBHM bands (mainly Iron Maiden) and folk tunes with the punishing brutality and slamming wildness of death metal. But some years after they said \"Hey guys, I think we're pretty much tired of doing good melodic death albums and not being able to buy some fucking mansion on the West Coast with the money we get. I think we need to do something really awesome that the masses will buy\". And that's how this LP was created.\n\nNow let's go on with the music. Musically, every single song has a simple structure than goes like this: intro-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-some cheesy melodeath guitar lead-some fucking bridge-chorus-chorus-end. There are sometimes variations, but nevermind. They stopped playing with song structures, like they did before and this kind of building up a song resembles very much to rock-and-roll and pop song structures. This is not a bad thing, but it gets worn out quickly. The good thing is that they are not as fake as some bands, they can actually catch the pop-like atmosphere (I don't mean the pop that airs today on the radio, I mean real pop singers like Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston or to some extend Tina Turner) they desire and make it pleasant and enjoyable throughout the album. \n\nThe guitars are pretty nice, but filled with musical flaws. They have the desired catchiness, but tend to be boring after some time. Some solos or more leads would've solved this problem, but...they were to lazy and wanted the americans who know nothing about metal to actually swallow up this album with ease. The guitars pretty much create this pop atmosphere along with the vocals, but better songwriting should've done the trick better. The atmosphere is pretty enjoyable, but it could've been more pop (of course, without sounding like some Pierce The Veil or All Time Low pop-punk assholes). The guitar parts are muddy all the time, in terms of production. It's like the producer turned the gain-button very high. This creates some kind of wall of sound, that drowns the vocals and the bass sometimes. What I like about the production is that they didn't aim for a sterile, overproduced and robotic sound, but pretty much stuck to their old guitar tone and changed it to the place, where you can still recognize it as In Flames, but tell that there have been some modifications.\n\nThe drums are simplified. Blast beats are gone, fast doublebass is gone, death metal in general is gone in the drum department. The drummer employs sometimes a faster style of playing but these are short bursts that come and gone, so overall they stuck to the heavy metal/hard rock drumming. The bass...well is pretty OK, if you like your bassist to blindly follow what your rhythm guitarist plays. As I said, because of the muddy production it is most of the time drowned by the wall of highly-distorted guitars (Don't get me wrong, distorted guitars are the core of melodeath and of metal in general, but the production of this album makes them too loud and too distorted).\n\nIn the vocal department, there is a great change. Low, guttural growls are now history and their place was taken by high and raspy screams, which along with the decent clean vocals manage to be a mediocre addition to the band's sound and style. The cleans, not as high and gay as today's singers employ, are powerful and lyrical. The vocal melodies are catchy (of course...That's what they've been aiming for), but along with the lyrics get boring over time. The lyrics are pretty emotional and totally reflect the state of spirit of the one who wrote them, without ressembling to today's emo/-core lyrics, which are plagued with themes like this: \"A 15-year-old angsty teenager is ditched by his girlfriend and whines the whole song, that the girl (or \"stupid fucking whore\" as he calls her) left him behind and fucked a real man.\" You got it!\n\nEven though I wrote some pretty things and not so many bad things in this review, you might think why this opus doesn't have more than a 55% rating. I gave this mark, because I had to judge a melodeath band that put out a so-called melodeath album, which turned out to be more pop that metal. This shit is not melodic death metal anymore. It's somewhere between the pop, heavy, extreme metal border, thus shall not be called melodic death metal or death metal in general. If it was a metalcore band or a power metal band or even a black metal band putting out this album, then it would've been something else....but it isn't. If you like some softer kind of metal, this album is for you. If you are into death metal, melodeath or extreme metal in general, stay away from this.\n",
        "\nMany years ago I had some interest in this band. For good or bad, these times are long gone. I did not have the intention to write such a review since I don't tend to be offensive to other fans, but this left me speechless in the worst of ways. I have not checked in depth the last records In Flames put out, because as I already stated I have lost absolutely all my faith in them long ago, but with \"Sounds of playground fading\" these guys went too far even for the lousy direction they took so far.\n\nSo here we go. I was sitting in my chair, watching a metal show on TV and they played \"Deliver us\". I could not believe my eyes and ears. My first thought was 'ugh, disgusting'. Then 'Is this Avril Lavigne cover band'? Or what, new experimental pop metal? These are all rhetorical questions to which you don't have to answer. This is blasphemy. This is Satan pissing on Christianity in terms of death metal. In Flames literally piss on their debut album and the intention they might have had some time ago - to play \"death metal\". This is not even melodic death metal. Melo death bands, Dark Tranquility for example, as much as I despise them at least have some pride. I don't know what these guys were trying to do, but as I watched an interview with their lead guitar player I have some ideas. He said that they wanted to be as popular as Iron Maiden. Holy Christ, Oden and Thor! This is what happens when someone intentionally tries to be popular and to sell songs.\n\nOkay, let's stop on the music. It is obvious that these guys can compose music. Yes, they apparently know how to put a song together and they sure as hell know how to make it sell out. Most songs on this album have cheesy lyrics, Nickleback meets modern Machine head sounding riffs that are so polished and electronically sounding as if made to be played in the mall. The difference between the last band mentioned and In Flames is that In Flames have wiped out all the raw material. The guitar sound is so fake that at times I wonder if humans are playing real guitars or the whole thing is electronically produced. The drumming is lame and in perfect harmony with the sleeping agression of the record. Most choruses would be okay I guess if this was supposed to be female fronted gothic rock. The one in \"Deliver us\" can even make you cry - especially if you like soap operas.\n\nYou see, I wouldn't be that disappointed and offended if this was not supposed to be metal. After I heard this thing called \"Sounds of a playground fading\" I played \"Lunar Strain\". And this is where it gets really bad - when you make a comparison and see where these musicians where musically and where are they now. As good and righteous as the debut was, this is how impossible and absurd the new release is. All the amazing emotional soloes, the perfectly matching harmonies are gone. The metal spirit is gone. If you enjoy heavy music, just forget about this and try to forget about this band.\n",
        "\nI would put this on the same level as Colony if it wasn't for Ander's nu metal inspired diarrhea noises. With solid riffs, amazing drumming, great leads and solos, and clean production, this is par for the course with Colony and Jester Race, but because of Anders' awful nu metal/metalcore vocals this doesn't live up to its full potential. \n\nI know vocals aren't everything, but as a vocalist it bugs me to hear someone take a good template (in this case the high growls of Jon Tardy and Chuck Schuldiner) and chop it up with the limp-wristed nature of commercial bullshit (in this case the whiny mumbling of Korn and Machine Head). But shitty vocals aside, the music itself is right on par with your standard melodic power metal bands.\n\nSo what are the positive elements? Well, as any guitarist would say, riffs and solos, and this album comes packed full of brilliant, fun, heavy, melodic, and catchy riffs. Some might complain about the somewhat formulaic verse-chorus-verse-chorus format, but I couldn't care less. This isn't Fates Warning or Queensryche, so I don't expect much innovation or out-of-the-box progressions. Like with every In Flames album, the bass takes a back seat to the vocals and guitars, so this isn't an album to go looking for mind-blowing bass. And much like with Colony, Daniel delivers behind the kit, and right on par with any power metal drummer. \n\nSo, if you ignore the half-assed vocals, what you get is pretty much a guitarist's bread and butter, good riffs and solos. My favorite tracks would have to be Pinball Map (solid Iron Maiden worship), Only For the Weak (with a keyboard fill in the chorus that's eerily similar to \"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\" and a nice groovy stomp), the title track (more good Maiden worship), Square Nothing (SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME, WITH THE DEMON OF MINE!), Suburban Me (good track right in vein of Yngwie's Malmsteen), and Satellites and Astronauts (one of the few tracks where I genuinely like the lyrics). I rate this C+, B- on a good day.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s no secret that In Flames have been on a downhill slide. Soundtrack to Your Escape was a horrible depiction of a band selling out, although things have gotten progressively better, with Come Clarity being a decent enough album in its own right. The music just does not contain any interesting passages and the added electronica has been more detrimental than entertaining. The main event that will change the aspect of this album was the departure of Jesper, whose influence arguably drove the band in their current direction as he was the primary songwriter.\n\nThat being said, Bjorn Gellote has taken on more of a role in writing in their recent ventures, with this album being the first time we hear pure, unadulterated Bjorn. For the most part, this album serves as a step in the right direction. SoaPF has that unfortunate modern and slightly nu-metal sound, but when you take away the production and really listen to the riffs, the old school Gothenburg comes through. At least on some songs. \n\nI\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve heard this before, but I can\u2019t stress this enough with this and many other \u2018experimental\u2019 albums and bands; the songs that are actually metal on the album are the best. If it sounds elitist, too bad; it\u2019s the truth. The less-epic-than-intended single Deliver Us, closer Liberation, and dubstep spawning Where the Dead Ships Dwell are all decent songs in their own right, but the synthesizers cannot replace the guitars, especially when they are not even written by the band members.\n\nThat being said, some of the keyboard sounds are pretty cool. The shades that pervade during some rougher sections of Where the Dead Ships Dwell and Ropes add some much needed atmosphere to otherwise bland songs, and they supplement the fact the Anders does not quite have the most melodic singing voice. The band also uses other techniques to change the sound throughout the album. Trademark In Flames watery guitars provide the intro and breaks on the title track and All for Me, and The Attic is a hauntingly simple ditty that lets the vocals show off for a little. As a massive orchestra nerd as well, the string sections on A New Dawn proves to be the most refreshing and emotionally evocative moment on the album.\n\nStill, the rockers are what make this album passable, and Bjorn certainly ups the aggression from the emo-core catastrophe that was A Sense of Purpose (don\u2019t deny it). Fear is the Weakness features some of the most kick-in-the-teeth riffs IF has put out in a long time, the title track delivers on a moderately intricate but rhythmically sound riff, and Enter Tragedy creates enough of an atmosphere for the vocals to really rip out a strong track. And I truly feel that if you reworked the production, A New Dawn could have been pulled right off of the classic The Jester Race.\n\nStill, the drums suffer the [second] most (bass isn\u2019t even relevant, except for a solid groove on Darker Times and The Puzzle). When Svensson starts to hit the double bass, it only turns head banging passages into breakdowns that one can only shake their head at. I swear, there isn\u2019t a single time that he actually gets his stuff together and throws something higher tempo at us. Were it not for his part, the songs might have varying tempos, but by the end of the album, you can pretty much predict with solid accuracy the pacing and drum patterns. By far the drums have fared the worst over the years.\n\nThe vocals are actually pretty solid, but that has been something that Anders has been improving upon since their original fall from grace. He is actually a decent singer, and despite the chorus heavy arrangement of the songs, he can actually throw some nice hooks around. Ropes is the only song on Sounds of a Playground Fading that features nothing but clean singing. Pretty much everything else is kind of a grizzled mild singing voice. By no means is it the classic vocal duty given in the Clayman and earlier era, but it suffices, and it has a decent edge to it, so the songs feel varied between metal and hard rock.\n\nThe best vocals are on the interlude called The Attic, with soft whispered lyrics that feel almost dystopian in their musings. The title track also is notable for its vocal delivery, which feels very inspired and real, for lack of a better term. Fear is the Weakness also has Friden slamming down the gauntlet in anger. That being said, the vocals can feel boring and totally generic in places, especially on All for Me and Liberation.\n\nLyrically speaking, this is not a concept album, but there is a general sense of coming of age ethics in all of the songs. The title track and Darker Times speak of the changing world and moving with or against it, while tracks like Fear is the Weakness and Enter Tragedy express disgust with conformity and the like. The final two tracks, A New Dawn and Liberation, talks about leaving lives behind and moving on, although it doesn\u2019t sound nearly so sappy when it is sung. The rest of the tracks fall under this umbrella for the most part, although Ropes and Deliver Us seem kind of like cheesy and dressed up love songs (please, contain your rage. This isn\u2019t anything you didn\u2019t see coming.).\n\nStill, there is not any large stylistic change going on here. Bjorn didn\u2019t solve all of their problems, but he\u2019s moving the band in the right direction. I don\u2019t foresee any change back to the classic melodic death metal sound, but I doubt they will fit all of the nu-metal generic bands of whatever day of the year it is. To put it bluntly, this is as good as its going to get. Of new age In Flames, this is best album they have produced, with Come Clarity a moderate second. If people were at least a little bit open to more modern sounds, this album will provide a few enjoyable listens, but this is not the old In Flames, which still gives me much woe. But give it a shot, as there are still some good tracks and I still can\u2019t give up on the band (so long as they try and get better with the synths). I was always told that I was stubborn. Best tracks: Fear is the Weakness, The Attic, Enter Tragedy, and A New Dawn.\n",
        "\nI personally think SoaPF is an improvement over A Sense of Purpose. While I did enjoy ASoP it was still a rather weak release. On Sounds In Flames seem to go for a little heavier approach and while its nothing like their old school melodic death metal albums its better than the last album.\n\nFirst, either I'm getting used to Anders' vocals or he is actually getting better at his singing and growling. Where as post Colony his screams seemed almost too forced and like he was trying to copy Jonathan Davis from Korn. Here I don't even cringe while listening. This is a big deal since in the past Anders Friden was probably the weak link of the band. I'm interested to see how those who disliked his style in the past feel about what they might hear here. I have to admit though on Ropes his singing voice kinda falls flat and sounds a bit weak, probably because his accent is so obvious.\n\nThe lyrics are still a mess. Its not even necessarily the subject matter (personal struggles which has been done to death), but the lyrical make up itself. Old In Flames always had interesting lyrics about science fiction and future issues. But on the last 3 or 4 albums they switched to inner turmoil. But Anders must still not have a good grasp on english or something because the lyrics just don't flow properly in a number of places.\n\nOne of the big things about this record is how guitarist (and the last founding member) Jesper Stromblad left before the recording began. But as soon as you go through the album once you can tell that with the last few releases Jesper played a smaller and smaller part in the writing process. This sounds like a proper progression of A Sense of Purpose and what you would expect the band to sound like even if Jesper had stayed. So Bjorn and Niclas Engelin pull off the same sound you know and love (or don't) from the past few albums.\n\nIn Flames continue adding a little more of a progressive/experimental edge to their sound. The Jester's door is a mix of electronic and instrumental music but is very quiet and soft. The title track is soft guitars for about the first minute before shooting off into something resembling what you might hear from Come Clarity. There are really no bad tracks on this album save for maybe Jester's Door which is basically a throw away/filler track. The band really hits the melody strong here though with tracks like Deliver Us, All For Me, The Puzzle, ect ect. As always there is a big emphasis on the guitar harmonies, one of my favorite things about IF.\n\nThere album hits on a darker tone though as well. Along with Jester's Door there is The Attic which is like this albums shorter version of The Chosen Pessimist. The last minute or two of Liberation isn't quite as dark but the clean guitars going on with the drumming sticking to the background as the song finishes give it that sort of feel.\n\nSounds of A Playground Fading is an excellent album if you take it for what it is, a modern metal album. It's a sort of mix between A Sense of Purpose and Come Clarity with a little more progressive/experimental frame of mind to it. As always Daniel Svensson's drumming is a joy to listen to and the melody makes this an easy, fun album to get into. The riffs stand out as being easy on the ear without crossing into alternative/rock territory. And with Anders vocal improvements I think In Flames fans who enjoy their discography as a whole are in for a treat.\n\nOriginally reviewed @ http://abaddonsmetalshop.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nIn Flames is a phenomenon that I don't really understand. They are very popular and really get many reviews but most metal fans seem to profoundly dislike them since the late nineties or so. I really ask myself why frustrated and closed minded fans of the band's early days that don't stop bashing the so-called modern (a word that doesn't even mean a thing) approaches of the band, criticize the band got overall too commercial (what's the problem with being commercial) and flame the band's singer Anders Friden (if you don't like him you should simply try out one of many other melodic death metal bands). I have always wondered why people still spend time on this band and give so many wrong and negative impressions. If you like modern In Flames, you can't dislike this record. Anybody else shouldn't even try and look for something else. It's because of many negative opinions that I discovered the band only a few years back but I got positively surprised and discovered a very unique, diversified and experimental band that hasn't released any boring or closed minded material. \"Soundtrack To Your Escape\" is no exception to this and has many strong points. It's far from being among the band's best records but it's also far from being the worst effort as many would suggest. The record is a pretty good average album in a strong discography and it has a really addicting flow. You won't have any negative surprises on here as this album is one hundred percent in Flames and nothing else. I would understand if a fan would flame the somewhat transitional and sometimes pointless \"Come Clarity\", an early record like \"Lunar Strain\" that had a different singer or the last and more catchy and commercial \"Sounds Of A Playground Fading\" but there is really no reason to flame this album here. I really don't get the point and suggest the open minded metal fan to not believe the hype and try this album out if he or she wants to discover a solid In Flames record.\n\nThis record contains many energizing and catchy tracks that are potential hit singles. That doesn't mean that they are boring, they have in fact many subtle changes in style but the band has the talent to write really gripping choruses and catchy melodies and mix that with past and present influences. A good example is the single \"The Quiet Place\" that has some electronic and industrial influences but still the typically emotional and catchy vocals that made this band famous. The band made a good choice to put this out as a single. Another great song of this kind is the addicting \"My Sweet Shadows\". The catchy and harmonious \"Superhero Of The Computer Age\" that is a great song with a stupid title or the comparable \"Bottled\" which include some additional vocals and has an interesting melancholic gothic feeling could have also been some underground successes as singles and may have attracted a younger public which I don't mean negative at all. Those two songs contain everything In Flames stand for and add a unique contemporary gothic or industrial note to the sound. Purist fans could have found the choice of the faster and harder but still very emotional \"Dead Alone\" appealing or the typical melodic death killer \"Dial 595-Escape\" with energizing vocals, a fast rhythm and a melodic Iron Maiden worship guitar solo. \n\nAs you can read, there is a lot of diversity in the album and normally, there should at least be a few songs that might please to any fan of any age, background and attitude. The only negative aspect is maybe the fact that this record tries to be too wide spread and please to everyone. On the other side, a strange fact is that a few guitar riffs still seem to be used several times in the weaker middle part of the record and sound somewhat worn-out after a while. \n\nSome may call this record a superficial commercial attempt but I it an interesting work of diversity where old and new In Flames collide and turn out to stick well together and be much more similar as one might think. \n\nI would like to point out that there are also two very experimental tracks which I really adore on the album. The first one is \"Evil In A Closet\" which is a very atmospheric and relaxing half ballad. The second one is the underrated bonus track \"Discover Me Like Emptiness\" that you should check out. This track has an eerie atmosphere in the beginning and leads to many variations by showing all the different styles and inspirations one could discover in the entire record and that made In Flames what they are today. This song is a good choice to present this band to a friend who doesn't know much about the Swedish legends. If you can get your hands on the special edition you should really get it and spend some money for this great bonus track that should have made it on the album and could have even been a very good single choice.\n\nIn the end you should check this album out and don't trust all the negative rumours about it. There are many catchy tracks but also quite diversified and almost progressive ones. There are some calmer and atmospheric songs but also a few fast paced melodic death metal killers. There are some modern vibes but some traditional In Flames sounds around, too. I think that \"Soundtrack To Your Escape\" is nothing you must escape from and is a courageous and colourful potpourri of ideas. The only thing you need to appreciate this record is to have an open mind and some time to let the whole thing grow. In Flames have always developed and experimented while they were nevertheless faithful to their roots and trademarks since the earliest years. This album is no exception but a very good example for this. I like this addicting grower and I am sure there is much more potential in this as many want to see at first sight.\n",
        "\nThis album is exactly what you've come to expect from In Flames if you've listened to more than one post-Clayman album. This is essentially Reroute to Remain part V. The previous album, A Sense of Purpose, was in some ways a slight departure from this sound \u2013 indeed sound being the keyword here \u2013 but they have returned again to making replicas of their grand sellout album, Reroute to Remain. Each such replica has its own definitive characteristics, and for this album such a characteristic is increased softness of sound and very prominent synth.\n\nIt appears even less effort than ever before was put into writing this new album. In Flames has reduced itself to the level of the most generic metalcore-infused alternative rock bands. The songs repeat themselves nauseously, and the music jumps from wall-of-sound esque grand wailing choruses \u2013 that are, mind you, the most saccharine thing you've ever heard by a metal band that isn't a group of fruitcakes from Italy playing \u201dpower metal\u201d \u2013 into the most generic possible groove metal riffs that I frankly once thought In Flames would never resort to. As I said before, this direction should come as no surprise to anyone who has listened to In Flames's records from the last decade or so: from this band we've come to expect downtuned guitars that spit out obnoxious groove riffs, a singer who's mainly capable of emitting whiny half-screams and writing lyrics that would make an angsty teenager blush with embarrasment, uninnovative drumming and simple pop rock songwriting. This is nothing but metalcore in its most radio-friendly form. In Flames has went quite far in making this as plastic and soft as possible. No instrument \u2013 not even the downtuned occasionally fast guitar chugs, or the drum sounds, or even the so-called harsh vocals \u2013 has any edge to it, and it's all further softened by the wall-of-sound effect created by possibly hundreds of layers, as well as the soft, mellow synth sounds so very prevalent here. The melodies and harmonies are all fluffy, nice, soft \u2013 what the album's audience probably consider to be beautiful, but what only to the ears of one whose musical taste is largely defined by what MTV plays is anything but ridiculous \u2013 and only counterpointed by the post-chorus groove metal riffs, that may sound brutal, again, to the MTV audience, but what are incredibly tame and weak to the ears of anyone else. \n\nThere is little reason to listen to this album, not even for the sake of morbid curiosity, for even in that department this album will leave you disappointed. The music is mostly inoffensive; it's not as such a fuck-up from In Flames in the way St. Anger or Amoral's Ari Koivunen album are \u2013 it's professionally made, it's well calculated and considering it's prime function (money) it's pulled off quite well, if very lazily (as the self-repeating never changing drum patterns portray) \u2013 but the effect it makes it possibly even worse. For any real metal fan this is just as toxic as St. Anger, or even worse, for it's a hideous mutilation of the elements of metal that once influenced In Flames.\n",
        "\nRant I: Vent\n\nThis is the embodiment of fucking shit. I hate this album. At one point, it was a wet teenage dream of mine cause of the In Flames brand. Reroute To Remain introduced me to In Flames, but this was one of the albums that somehow quenched my metal thirst. Back in 2004, I didn\u2019t know any better, and seven years later I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve improved as much as I should. Although I\u2019ve changed, this album hasn\u2019t, and it never will, because it loves being what it is. It loves feasting on the misplaced, misguided hatred of damaged youth. This album exists to convince kiddies that they don\u2019t belong, but that it (meaning Soundtrack To Your Escape) understands. It did that to me, and now that I\u2019ve long grown out of it, it looks for new life to latch onto, as it always will now that its existence cannot be completely erased. \n\nRant II: Chug\n\nSoundtrack To Your Escape is stacked with a dozen tracks at the very least, and even when I liked this album it wasn\u2019t something that was loved. It was something I didn\u2019t come back to a lot because nothing stood out. Everything is loud, modern, polished, and insensibly executed, with a good mix between the instruments as to not bury anything like Reroute To Remain did. From one perspective, this album meets the standard by having all of the above traits, but from another viewpoint it\u2019s a complete fuck up. It\u2019s a complete fuck up to make an album have all the aforementioned and turn whatever songs here sound sterile, emotionless, boring, and stripped of any fervor. \n\nSoundtrack To Your Escape wants to be aggressive \u2013 it is supposed to understand the angst of the kiddies with angst of its own, after all. Reality check \u2013 sounding loud doesn\u2019t equal sounding aggressive. Take away that polished, modern production and you get some limp, ineffective chugging with ass-kissing bass support. Aside from the slight booms heard under the riffs and above the drumming, I don\u2019t think the bass has any point being played. Not to rag on any other band that does the same to their bass lines (which is a lot of bands), but for an album with absolutely nothing to offer, it\u2019s pathetic to see the band trying to shine poo with more poo. Aside from the chugfest and puerile melodic death riffs, the callous echoes of the drum snare sound like robotic bonks. Svensson, a man that should be known for his blistering drumming, ferocious vocals, and compelling songwriting, instead does lackluster fills and has his seat raised higher and higher after the money raked in from every album this band puts out. He has no motivation to try any harder than the music and band he\u2019s playing for.\n\nThere are a few melodic death sections that fans of such would enjoy, but that\u2019s a huge suspension of disbelief. It\u2019d be pointless listing them, really, as the execution butchers any hint of gripping composition. The mechanized drum kit, the overweight blasting of the guitars, the glint of an industrial sound, and comatose atmosphere to top it off. Many of the riffs sound the same, even though they\u2019re from different songs. Then again, if chugging goes on in every song, then of course the riffs will sound the same. There is no indication that Jesper Str\u00f6mblad, the man that churned out power metal-inspired melodic death leads ten years before is the dude playing these static, toughguy riffs. The other credible member, Daniel Svensson, has been whittled down to a machine pumping out the exact same drum bass filler song after song.\n\nRant III: Anders\n\nThese vocals, for the level that In Flames were at the time and for the level that they\u2019re at now, are horrifyingly bad. No, these vocals are so appallingly pathetic that it makes me feel uneasy that someone somewhere gets enjoyment out of them, as I had at one point. You got two general styles this dreadlock fuck uses: screaming and clean vocals. The screams drip with juvenile anxiety, even when layered or electronically altered; when electronically altered they\u2019re irritating screeches. It\u2019s a high scream that registers lower than most emo/post-hardcore screamo vocalists, as of course Anders\u2019 voice isn\u2019t meant for such singing. These screams are supposed to be the aggressive side of the band, but with each ghastly scream comes the whiny \u201ceueueueueuegh\u201d that gets hawked out Anders\u2019 throat.\n\nGushing with that \u201ceueueueeugh\u201d on different levels of shittiness are the clean vocals. Layered, buried under the other instruments, or plainly sung on their own, the douche-chills I get when Anders\u2019 sings with his whiny cleans are unmatched. It\u2019s such an awkward feeling because you know something\u2019s wrong with them. Off-key more than once, childish, faux-passionate, and mopey compared to the loud ruckus the instruments make. A lot of it is ball-less crooning / whining (ala Korn) like with \u201cDiscover Me Like Emptiness\u201d and \u201cMy Sweet Shadow\u201d (though the Korn comparison hits home harder on tracks like \u201cBorders And Shadings\u201d).\n\nRant IV: Dismissed\n\nI can\u2019t in good conscience give this album any respect. \u201cMy Sweet Shadow\u201d may have a hint of poise, if only barely. However, knowing the objective and deception of this album, I may as well be Soundtrack To Your Escape\u2019s prophet of falsehood if I give this album any mention of praise and a score to reflect such. Association with this piece of shit is a stain on anyone\u2019s tastes, for such an album is devoid of worth and musical sophistication. Just looking at the artwork\u2026 the bland band logo and title, the four primary Listerine colors, and that useless\u2026 what is that, a subwoofer? Let such a tasteless cover indicate the emptiness of this album. You go in, you hear it, and you get nothing out of it. Soundtrack To Your Escape is fuck all except flaccid riffs and retarded singing backed by inconsequential dick-posturing for the teens and the bros.\n",
        "\nFor the sake of self-respect\u2026 no, nevermind, the band threw that out on the last album. This is where they had a toe in the doorway of the United States, and they weren\u2019t leaving without stripping themselves of musical integrity to get in. My biggest complaint, summed up in that last sentence, is how fake this album sounds. Now the band created the ultimate phony sack of garbage with Soundtrack To Your Escape, but for a first volley, they knew just how synthetic they wanted to sound. Look no further if you want processed, non-critical, simplistic, absent-of-atmosphere dogshit (oh excuse me, I mean badly imitated modern rock).\n\nHere\u2019s one general problem off the bat. This is a digitized, amplified mess with no personality, but what\u2019s the genre? It\u2019s not melodic death (in fact, very little is outright melodic death), and certainly not flat out rock. It\u2019s modern metal/rock that\u2019s mainstream, but how can that be when Anders\u2019 whiny, nasally screams have no appeal to them whatsoever? Non-extreme metal listeners would have to already be into harsher vocals (by rock standards) to get into this music. I know, because I was that kind of fan back in the day. Listening to this, I knew I loved whatever the instruments were doing (being loud), but I didn\u2019t like the vocals at all. Except one thing \u2013 the clean vocals I could tolerate.\n\nBingo\n\nAnders is powerless as a vocalist to begin with, but the mockery isn\u2019t just in his \u201charsh vocals\u201d anymore. His screams are pissed off \u201cgrrrrrs\u201d at every start before he exhales with a childish replication of mutilated screams. Think of all those awful screamo vocalists (and I mean those emo / post-hardcore screamo singers), and then imagine a register lower \u2013 that\u2019s what Anders sounds like. A lot of times they get buried under the instruments anyway, considering how noisy everything else is thanks to the loudness of the production. Anyway, the catch is this \u2013 Anders is like a really shitty Dragon Ball Z villain, in that he\u2019s only useful for a limited number of episodes before his unique power is worth jack shit because everyone found a way to get around it. Anders and the band know that they have nothing to offer during anything other than the chorus, which is half of the textbook rule \u2013 ensure that the chorus is catchy as all hell. That\u2019s where the band hopes you, as the listener, are sucked in. For a number of bands, even in metal, this is par for the course and the standard. However, for a band with absolutely no formula and devoid of character, this is digging a grave with bare hands.\n\nPerfect example \u2013 \u201cTrigger\u201d \u2013 Jesus fuck, a music video even went along with this garbage. \n\nThis song screams factory-direct: factory-direct start-stop chugga-chugga riffs in the verse with maybe a few ounces of melodic death, Svensson continuing to look at those dollars raking under his drum stool, and roughly ten seconds of soloing trying to recapture what In Flames did on Clayman. The composition is already middling, with the verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure having nothing to offer, but the way it\u2019s executed, ugh. Keep in mind that there are worse songs on this album, as expected, but this is the single, along with \u201cCloud Connected\u201d \u2013 another assembly-line constructed filler. Anders, just like on every song here, is in a race to get to the chorus. No song gains anything with Anders\u2019 screaming, but it\u2019s the chorus that\u2019s the jackpot, according to the band. That\u2019s when Anders lets loose those awkward \u201ceueueueugueuuegeueh\u201d cleans that\u2019s heavy on the accent. It\u2019s not harmonic or very pleasant, for one, yet it\u2019s used on every song (with \u201cMetaphor\u201d devoted fully to the clean singing).\n\nNow that\u2019s \u201cTrigger\u201d, but on the other songs it isn\u2019t that much different. Some he uses whatever \u201catmosphere\u201d the band scrounges up with the electronics like on the title track to sound cryptic, but it\u2019s such an awkward voice. The aforementioned \u201cMetaphor\u201d is a fully clean track with these clean vocals, and misplaced between probably the most melodic death oriented track on the album (\u201cDark Signs\u201d \u2013 essentially a carbon copy of \u201cCloud Connected\u201d) and the chuggernaut \u201cBlack & White\u201d. A few of these tracks would hurt, but fucking fourteen of them one after the other is a gauntlet. You would think with all the stuff padded into each song \u2013 electronics, chugging, the sneering screams, and the failing cleans \u2013 there would be enough to create some variety. Not exactly, as every song follows the same formula and nothing has any redeeming value to it. Take \u201cDrifter\u201d for instance, a short chugfest with another ounce of melodic death in it buried under the same riff heard on every song, as well as those screams during the verse and the cleans during the chorus. It has no personality \u2013 loud playing doesn\u2019t mean energetic.\n\nSvensson I still hold as the only member worth anything anymore. The man, even on this album, is playing with his gut as he attacks the kit with pummeling double bass. Obviously he doesn\u2019t do anything very impressive, but with pointlessly loud music as this, all you could ask is that he shows a little hostility. That\u2019s true, and the kit is very loud, but once more there\u2019s no reason. There\u2019s absolutely no point to anything being played here, and the second I shut this off I know I\u2019ll be reinvigorated by something else.\n",
        "\n\u201cCome Clarity\u201d is a transitional album for In Flames. They combine their melodic death metal roots with a modern sound that has already been prominent on the previous records and add a mixture of experimental but at the same time more commercial material to this.\n\nI have always been attracted by the experimental side of In Flames and that\u2019s why I like this new part they have added to their sound most. \u201cDead end\u201d is a duet with pop singer Lisa Miskovsky that is delivering a very confident job and sounds more focussed than Anders Frid\u00e9n. This experiment is another beauty meets the beast duet and may target a younger and more commercial audience which may cause some problems to the traditional diehard fans. \u201cCome clarity\u201d is a calm power ballad and it speaks volumes when the band decided to chose this track as their title song as this track is a sign of change and progression for the band. It doesn\u2019t sound perfect and confident yet but shows us where the band would go for on the upcoming records. The tentative title track \u201cCrawl through knives\u201d is probably the most diversified track on the album and combines the old and new face of the band in a perfect way. If I had to choose one single song to present this album to a fried, I would surely go for this one. The experimental sound sample collage on the closing \u201cYour bedtime story is scaring everyone\u201d is on the other hand the most unusual song of the band to that date and leaves the fans on an eerie, awkward and surprising note.\n\nI must admit that I also like some of the modern death metal sound son the album. \u201cTake this life\u201d is a great and catchy opener and kicks the album off in a perfect way. The following \u201cLeeches\u201d has some keyboard samples and presents maybe the most melodic and catchy chorus of the record while the verses are filled with dark emotions. The memorable \u201cOur infinite struggle\u201d stands out with a great relaxing and dreamy middle part. \u201cReflect the storm\u201d has a very melancholic and commercial chorus that proves us that Anders Frid\u00e9n is trying out something new on this record.\n\nThis record is especially a transitional album for him. Frid\u00e9n almost sounds schizophrenic at some points of the record. A part of his usual melodic death vocal skills and a good feeling for catchy and powerful choruses that he employs more than ever on this disc he has a lot of clean vocal parts that sound a little bit breakable, hesitating and whining at some points. He doesn\u2019t sound confident enough to carry some of the songs and tries to find a new style, a new approach while keeping his own identity alive. Especially next to a confident guest singer, Frid\u00e9n sound a little bit pointless in the duet and confusing in the harder tracks when he suddenly changes his approach in the chorus or bridge. When Frid\u00e9n suddenly has a magic moment and a great feeling for an emotional performance, he really shines and stands out but when he fails with his approach, the songs stand out but mostly in a rather negative way. This album really rises and falls with his performance. But it was a necessary step and experience for him as he sounds different, more confident and even more diversified on the future albums and I feel that he evolved in an amazing way.\n\nAnother negative fact for me is that there are too many traditional melodic death metal tracks that all sound pretty much alike. The boring and faceless \u201cVanishing light\u201d is probably the worst example but a part of a few little changes and courageous moments, songs like \u201cVacuum\u201d, \u201cPacing death\u2019s trail\u201d \u201cVersus Terminus\u201d and \u201cScream\u201d keep the band stuck in old habits and slow their development and their experimental side down to please to the fans. Those songs sound like many tracks that we have heard in better form on the previous records and don\u2019t impress me so that I would consider them as fillers. Let\u2019s note that I mentioned five songs which is almost half of the record and one of the main reasons why gave a lower rating to this objectively said important transitional effort.\n\nIn the end, this album might be either the last one that could still please at some points to the traditional fans or the first one that might please to those who have known and loved a more diversified, experimental and yet commercial In Flames that move away from their roots with big and confident steps to evolve further. A true fan and open minded metal maniac might though get used to both sides of the band and discover a rare pearl with this present album and pardon some weaker aspects. That's why it's hard to give an objective note to this album because it's about evolution, experiments and emotions.\n\nIf I had one single sentence to describe this album, I would go for this one: This record might honestly said be one of the weakest ones in the band's discography but maybe the most important one they have ever done.\n",
        "\nSo if you are a Gothenburg fan and have not been lying inside a cryogenic sleep chamber for the last couple of months, you know the utterly impossible has happened and Jesper Stromblad has quit In Flames. Sure, this is not as alarming as if Steve Harris had waved The Beast goodbye, and Jesper hasn\u2019t been exactly writing everything for the group lately, but not every band can survive the departure of a key songwriter easily. The interesting thing is that In Flames has. You'd be hard pressed to actually tell the difference.\n\nIf you know the band, you know they work around a formula for almost every album, and this one is, obviously, ASOP's more eclectic brother. The blueprint is laid down the same way: moshing palm muted riffs, \u201cwall of sound\u201d production, clean sung hooks, acoustic stuff to create a faux back-to-the-roots feel and all that stuff. I was hoping for the input of newcomer Niclas Engelin, but the man brought nothing new to the table (as Bjorn pretty much wrote the entire album) and Peter Iwers keeps on holding to his \u201cBassist that could not give less of a shit\u201d trophy for dear life, so we don't get that much of a change.\n\nHowever, once again In Flames falters when it comes to songwriting. It might sound like nitpicking, but the listener will soon notice how the first seconds of \u201cDarker Times\u201d, \u201cEnter Tragedy\u201d and \u201cThe Puzzle\u201d sound almost the same, while the title track and \u201cDarker Times\u201d have the same chord progression for the chorus. Check it out, you can safely sing the former\u2019s chorus into the latter and vice-versa. Again, I don\u2019t mean to be a nitpicking asshole, but that reeks of lazy work and shouldn\u2019t be present on an album by a band that is hailed by their new fans as being so adventurous and ever-changing.\n\nThe most unsettling aspect, at least for me, was the existence of \u201cLiberation\u201d, which is the perfect example (not to say proof) of how this band desires to be Sweden\u2019s heavier answer to 30 Seconds to Mars. A dreadful pop/alt rock song that features brain-dead instrumentation and probably Jared Leto himself, because Anders comes up as a pretty convincing sound-alike, except for his inclination towards nasal singing. Let\u2019s make things simple: If you\u2019re aiming to play on the radio, just release a pop album already and stop pretending to be some kind of revolutionary modern metal band. I don\u2019t know what is worse, actually; if it\u2019s the actual song or the myriad of fans that will applaud this piece of crap, declaring the band to be oh so open minded.\n\nWell\u2026 Lyrically, for the first time in years, Anders seems to be showing sparks of the poetic stuff from the old days amidst the whole adolescent ennui. I for one can see a stark difference from the lyrics of the title track (which seem to claim the film \u201cChildren of Men\u201d as an influence) and stuff like \u201cYou'll never understand me/and I don't care what you think/or maybe I do\u201d from \u201cThe Puzzle\u201d or maybe \u201cI'm tired; I'm fed up of this life!\u201d from \u201cEnter Tragedy\u201d. Tracks are also plagued (again) by the \"You and me\" lyrical dead end, and another awful clich\u00e9 rears its ugly head here, the \u201cI need your help/I need you to help me somehow\u201d idiocy. This way of writing romantic/tragic lyrics often degenerates into a cheesy, emo-ish pastiche when used in a shallow way like this. Check it out at tracks 4, 6 and 10 and you\u2019ll see. Summing up, pretty much every lyric here, (except for tracks 1 and 2) would perfectly fit on Come Clarity with its glaring emo sensibilities. And I don\u2019t mean it as some kind of cheap insult, seriously. Maybe it is just me. I just find it damn hard to take a bunch of old guys (only one, actually) writing about pre-pubescent affection seriously, just as much as I take Rhapsody and their dragons, sorcery and enchanted swords.\n\nNot much can be said about the singer\u2019s performance either. This album contains way less screams and more cleans, though; \"Ropes\u201d features mostly clean vocals, and I mean CLEAN, without a hint of any distortion whatsoever. On this particular track, I don't find Anders\u2019 voice particularly grating, but he desperately needs vocal coaching to teach him how to control things, because his voice cracks incessantly and that hiccup that has been plaguing (in my opinion) his voice since, I don\u2019t know, goddamn Skydancer is not a good sign. Seriously, get some coaching to help you get a grip on what remains of your cords. The cool tricks and layers of backing vocals will never be able to fully help outside the studio doors.\n\nAs per usual, In Flames sometimes sheds off the trash and comes up with some interesting stuff. Just like \u201cMy Sweet Shadow\u201d, \u201cThe Puzzle\u201d ends with a memorable and beautiful atmospheric guitar/keyboard line, while Daniel (who is inexplicably formulaic here) finds himself some space to write an attention grabbing pattern in the really good intro of \u201cAll for Me\u201d, on which the bass drum adds a measure each time the power chord soars. Props also go to \u201cA New Dawn\u201d with its tasteful middle break and a feeling that should please Colony/Clayman fans a lot, and I found myself really enjoying the duo between the orchestral elements and the electric ones nearing the end of the song before the last chorus.\n\nWhile Bjorn shows signs of weakness at writing good rhythm guitar riffs, his leads come up as pretty rocking overall. Oh, and the majority of the choruses is surprisingly catchy, probably being the album's best asset amidst the sub-par songwriting, for \u201cSounds of a Playground Fading\u201d acts just like a pop album; if the songs are getting a little bit boring, the choruses will probably pick them up, and it is up to you if this is a good thing or not. I particularly don\u2019t mind chorus-driven, straightforward albums, IF the other parts of the songs manage to catch my attention as well. Unfortunately, most of the songs here are boringly uneventful until the chorus comes to keep the skip button away from you.\n\nIn Flames took another step into the future, but it seems like they\u2019ve finally opted to be the icon for the legions of bands that desperately try to be the link between modern metal and accessible melodic rock music. This is a catchy but badly disjointed album, dragged down by an uninteresting vocal performance and an over-reliance on hooks instead of competent songwriting to keep the listener\u2019s attention.\n\nI don\u2019t despise the music here for being \u201ceasy to listen\u201d, but even then, there is a difference between competent and pedestrian. The Swedish quintet, unfortunately, still lacks the ability/vision to distinguish both and ends up stranded in a line between them.\n\nHighlights; A New Dawn, The Puzzle, and the chorus of the title track.\n",
        "\nOriginally published in \"The Wormwood Chronicles.\"\n\nEver get into a band and you really like them, and you feel special knowing that you like them so much, like they are an unknown treasure? Then, out of nowhere, someone you know starts to like them, and then eventually more and more people seem to be really into this band, and pretty soon you start to critique the way everyone else appreciates this band? That would be my relationship with In Flames. Fantastic band, got into them around when \"Colony\" first came out, and I continued to like them even though I hated the last, gawdawful excuse for Swedish metal, \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\u201d, but right around when the \"Trigger\" E.P. came out and that damn video was all over MTV2's Headbanger's Ball, it seemed that all these hardcore and metalcore and emo kids started to get really into them, and so therefore when the aforementioned gawdawful \"Soundtrack...\" came out, I really started to hate this band just for their fanbase. I felt as though their music and their sound was being compromised so that their new fans could more easily grasp them and therefore us seasoned-vet In Flames fans were being left out to dry.\n\nAnd then the band release \"Come Clarity\" as a slap in the face to this concept that I have conjured up...\n\nTruth be told, I didn't hold out much hope for this release. Not only was it's immediate predecessor a watered-down version of the real deal, but now with having left longtime label Nuclear Blast for more hardcore pastures on Ferret Music, the label run by Nora frontman Carl Severson, I was really worried. But this CD is awesome in every way shape and form. This uber-inspired disc is just what the band needed to put out. The songwriting is the best it's been since \"Colony\", and the sound quality is comparable to \"Reroute to Remain\", although with a more delicious sonic palate (crisper, for sure). Drummer Danny Svensson puts in his most ambitious performance since he joined the band, and guitarists Bjorn Gelotte and Jesper Stromblad churn out their best interplay in ages, playing the melody card to their advantage every time, and throwing in some downright pummeling riffage.\n\nAnd how about Anders? Remember back when us fans all thought he was starting to go a little kooky and we thought that he had this goofy idea about being some Swedish Jonathan Davis? Yeah, forget it, it\u2019s gone!!! Here again, is the best performance in ages actually, probably ever by the frontman, as he demonstrates a further developing melodic sensibility and clean singing approach best exemplified on the amazing second song Leeches, and his screaming simply has not been this good since at least \u201cClayman\u201d.\n\nAll in all, I am most pleased and this is probably going to be the best $10 (it was on sale) that I spend for the majority of the year. This is a return to form for the band and I think all former fans who gave up after the last few disappointments should give it a shot. Kudos, much Kudos!!!\n",
        "\nWell, times sure have changed since the true Gothenburg days. The 1990's in the Scandinavian metal scene was a time of courageous song writing and originality. Bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquility were completely different from anything forged from the depths of the earth. Melodies, raspy vocals, double bass, harmony, and progressive song writing were just beginning to be morphed into one genre. In Flames helped pioneer the genre of Melodic Death Metal much like the Beatles did for rock n' roll. The truth is, In Flames had their time. In my opinion this time was between Lunar Strain and Clayman. The albums that followed sounded like something shifted dramatically within the band. It could have been the influence of Western popular culture, or it simply could have been that the band was bored and tired of writing the same material over and over again. Mike Akerfeldt from Opeth has stated in interviews that the reason Opeth shifted their writing style was partly due to the fact that everyone was now writing melodic, dual guitar, harmonizing metal. In my mind, their transition was much more original than that of what In Flames made. My personal heart lies deep within their Gothenburg style writing when the melodies and progressive song writing was at the essence of the band. \n\nI don't care much for In Flame's newer material and much of that is due to the vocals of Anders. I am a death growl kind of guy. I do appreciate clean vocals once in a while but for some reason Anders does not reach a clean quality worth praising about. It sounds whiny and desperate. To me, it seems that he tries too hard. NU Metal, or Americanized metal according to me, is much more prominent in their music these days. I personally get very irritated by the American influence and think that much of the Metal-core is a bunch of junk. \n\nAs far as Sounds of a Playground Fading goes, I don't care for it. A few of the songs tease past riff writing, more like something off of Clayman, but the emotions seem very absent. Yeah, here and there they put in epic guitar melodies and ripping drums, much of what old time fans originally loved the band for, but they don't stick and are very brief. The songs are bland and just sound like every other Metal-core band out there these days. I wish I could tell the band, \"Hey guys, aren't you the ones who developed an original sound? Aren't you the ones who defied possibilities in metal song writing?\" My disappointment is clear when listening to this record but because of my dedication to the band, I will always try to find something to enjoy, even if it is only a couple of songs. But you know what, that is the beauty of music. Even when things seem like they have hit rock bottom, there are often things that seem like a candle is still burning. A few of the songs are a joy to crank up. I can still find myself head-banging and groovin'. \n\nI don't think In Flames will ever return to their melodic death metal past. The trail they have taken is just too different and as they have grown, their music has evolved with them. This is something that happens to all bands whether we like it or not. I will always buy IF records until they can't spit anymore out. That is just the kind of fan I am. Though, most likely what will be playing in my cd player will be a Lunar Strain, Jester Race, Whoracle, Colony, or Clayman album.\n",
        "\nIn a maneuver that surprises no one, the first post-Str\u00f6mblad album from In Flames continues to polarize the band's fan base and tread ever closer to the pop rock orientations that have been hinted at for almost a decade (beginning around Reroute to Remain). The modus operandi of the previous album returns: big hooks, emotional vocals that alternate between happiness and despair, traditional/power metal inspired solos, and plenty of modern metal grooves to sate the festival audiences whose moshing aspirations include anything with a guitar mute. If anything, it pushes well past A Sense of Purpose into the terrain of pure, mainstream heavy rock, with the faint traces of the band's 90s melodic riffing structures the one thing anchoring it to any semblance of the band's backlog.\n\nNow, I happened to enjoy A Sense of Purpose, much to my shock. There were about 7-8 songs there that mustered memorable guitar patterns, overly whining but effective vocals, and a nice variation in grooves and tempos, and the rest of the record did not fall far behind. I'm honestly not opposed to In Flames doing whatever the hell they want with themselves, as long as the music entertains, and even if it wasn't perfect, that album seemed to strike a good balance of their modern elements and the songwriting skill of the prior decade. Sounds of a Playground Fading builds upon similar aesthetics, only heavily favoring the slower to mid-paced fare and cleaning up on the processing of the production. There's much more clarity to the rhythm guitar and a lot of positive punch to the heavier sections, yet the lion's share of the new tracks seem to lack that same level of explosive energy that had my ears buzzing with the most bliss I had for the band since Whoracle. Some even feel like neutered, cardboard cutouts of previous tunes.\n\nFor example, the 2nd riff in \"Puzzle\", my favorite song on this album, is strikingly similar to a number of patterns used in \"Disconnected\", \"The Mirror's Truth\", and so forth, but at least it compensates with a passionate momentum and some uplifting atmosphere. The title track has a lot of the rhythmic bounce that dominated Reroute to Remain, with pleasant but predictable fills that don't inspire much hope for the rest of the fare. There are mild electronic influences (as in the intro to \"Where the Dead Ships Dwell\") and acoustic intros (\"All For Me\", \"Fear is the Weakness\"), but these are all par for the course after the previous set of albums, and they aren't writing anything so sugary here that this diversification brings strength to the song structures.\n\nThen there are a few songs that feel plain weak. \"Jester's Door\" is this self-referential, spoken word piece which had me gagging up my lunch. I'm not sure if it's a metaphor for Jesper's time with the band, or refers to the constant criticism leveled at the band for their ever morphing sound strategy, but its cheesy and should have been left on the cutting room floor. \"A New Dawn\" feels like an attempt to channel back to the times of Clayman or Whoracle, but the dual melody is simply too familiar, the grooves entirely lackluster. \"The Attic\" and \"Liberation\" see the band more directly in pop/modern rock terrain, the former a moody piece with atmospheric guitars and mostly whispered vocals, the latter radio rock with echoing guitar lines redolent of Amorphis on Tuonela...\n\nYeah, sure, great. So you can write mediocre rock songs that abandon the metal of your youths. Are these anything more than emo exercises for Anders? You can write them. That doesn't mean you HAVE TO, and such pieces serve only to the detriment of this record, unless In Flames are trying to land a spot on the soundtrack to the latest season of The Hills. Again, I'm not in opposition to such branching out, but the Swedes will always be the best at their heavier material, and Sounds of a Playground Fading ultimately needs a lot more of it to choke by. There are some decent cuts here (\"The Puzzle\" and \"Ropes\") that adapt and refine the tactics of the last album, but where I found myself unexpectedly in step with that effort's blaze of glory, I just kept drawing blanks this time. Sounds of a Playground Fading is hardly their worst, and I got more out of it than, say, Soundtrack to Your Escape, but its not about to win them many new friends.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWith the release of this record, In Flames continue in the style of their great and diversified predecessor \"A sense of purpose...\". That means that they do further experimentations and get away from their death metal roots. Anybody that is waiting for the band to dig in its own past and come back to where they were might be disappointed by this release and should bury its hopes. But anybody that liked the more experimental tracks from the last album such as the modern and diversified single \"Alias\" or the overlong psychedelic ballad \"The chosen pessimist\" will adore this album. The modern electronic sounds of the single \"Deliver us\" should be a good idea for anyone if he or she should really check this album out. The great opener and title track that opens with a calm and spiritual melody that could also fit to a ballad by \"Dream Theater\" or \"Metallica\" and surprises with a heavily addicting chorus also gives a good hint at what we should expect to come further on this release.\n\nI know that most metal maniacs won't like this. The ratings for this album might be very low in the near future and anything else would be a surprise to me. Those reviewers will tell you that the band forgets about its roots, sounds more like an alternative rock act, tends towards too commercial melodies, lacks of heaviness and writes strange lyrics about inner struggles and all those things are eventually right. But the band fact that this band tries out something new, does some great experimentations and continues its way even if a long time band member quit them and many fans were rather disappointed by the last records proves that they do what they like and don't do what we expect from them or what would be a commercial success.\n\nThe thing that changed in comparison to the last record is that the single tracks are less outstanding but that the album as a whole is very coherent and strong and no song sounds too similar to any other on here. I must also underline the diversified vocals that are more powerful and yet more diversified as before and don't sound as whiny as on the last record. \n\nAt some points, the band heads into an as experimental direction as the surprising last album from \"Linkin Park\" with electronic sounds in \"Deliver us\", atmospheric sound collages in \"The attic\" or the psychedelic experiment \"Jester's Door\". Clean vocal passages in the potential next single hits \"Ropes\" or the stunning closing \"Liberation\" where the band sounds as melodic and commercial and free from any metal boundaries as never before remind me of modern alternative rock acts such as the emotional \"Thirty seconds to Mars\", the more and more interesting \"My Chemical Romance\" and even the more progressive \"Muse\". Especially the second part of the album heads into such a direction and makes me think that the band could even go further into this direction on an upcoming record. \n\nThat doesn't mean that there are no more heavy riffs or scratched vocals like in \"The puzzle\" or \"Enter tragedy\" that should please to all fans of the band and that remind more of the songs of the last records. Some tracks also mix melodic death metal passages with surprising alternative rock passages and even orchestral arrangements like in the amazing \"A new dawn\" where the title indicated the style and direction. The changes are progressive on this record and not done in a radical way like \"Linkin Park\" did it. Anybody that listened to the last record should have been mentally prepared for this next step which is \"Sounds of a playground fading\". But any purist metal head that doesn't care at all about progressive alternative rock will have many problems to get an approach to this record.\n\nIn the end it really depends on how open minded you are if you are able to accept and eventually adore this record. Accept that you don't have a melodic death metal album in front of you but a potpourri of modern metal music with some major progressive metal and alternative rock influences that follow the style of the last record. As i liked the last record, I adore this album and this is a thing I never expected from a band like In Flames a few years ago when I was rather into heavy and power metal music. I have opened my mind and musically grown up and I think that this is a very refreshing piece of music that isn't comparable to any album I have in my collection until today. \"Sounds of a playground fading\" makes now a true In Flames fan out of me and I recently discovered their whole back catalogue which is different from what I hear here but very great in a different way. This record is a solid candidate for my top ten album list of the year 2011 and better than all those boring old fashioned bands such as \"Saxon\" or \"HammerFall\" or the revival groups such as \"Hell\" that bore me to death with their new nostalgic releases. But I let them live in their past while I listen to some modern music from time to time such as In Flames do with this record where I can't find one single filler. After a great last decade I'm now sure that the new decade will be musically as interesting and modern metal music must not hide in the shadows of the legendary eighties. I don't need to be wrongfully nostalgic as I feel happy to grow up in a time where music like this is made. This album is more than music, it's a statement and only a few chosen ones will follow In Flames on their way towards future records and I will surely be with them.\n\nIn Flames we trust!\n",
        "\nAfter the release of A Sense of Purpose, In Flames had appeared to have gone down in mostly everyone's opinion of them. From back in the hey day of Clayman and Whoracle, In Flames have appeared to have lost all touch with their Melodeath roots, and would need to re-reoute to remain, the irony, but this record showed a definite sign that things were picking up for Anders and co.\nFrom the first record they released off this record, Deliver Us, they appeared to have veered for the better away from ASOP more so towards the previous 3-4 releases - more along the lines of Take this Life and most of Come Clarity. Half of this album is of a musical style previously seen since Clayman, the other takes after \"Your Bedtime Story is Scaring Everyone\" in that it feels like it shouldn't be on one of Melodeath's finests' albums, at all.\n\nWhilst this album shares many properties with ASOP, it's more likeable for any diehard fans, largely due to In Flames' retraction back onto their heavier albums. A few solid riffs throughout makes this a mainstay for 2011 metal records, Anders is clearly enjoying this record as he makes it as he's covering topics and song themes that he hasn't been covering over his 20 or so year career with In Flames and Dark Tranquillity. \n\nThis album shouldn't be bought if you're looking for In Flames returning to their roots, but to complete the collection, as whilst it's not bad, it's not In Flames as most of us have loved them. This record shows real influences from metalcore from most of the recent bands, but very little influence from any of their Gothenburg bretherin which IF have sorely missed in the past 2 records.\n\nThe highlights to this album for me were definitely Liberation and Deliver Us, both are definitely something worth listening to as songs, but never compared to anything IF have released before; Liberation being their most commercially accessible song they've released to date bordering on pop rock, and for some reason is my guilty secret off this album as it's very simple to listen to, both musically and lyrically, not a masterclass in either. Deliver Us is perhaps the heaviest song off this album, and the first release, so it had more plays as it was out a month before the rest of the album, it's more technical, but again, no masterclass here.\n\nFor me, this album isn't too bad, but as an IF release? It's pretty poor, It's not something that'll be a mainstay in my Ipod for an extended period of time. It probably won't even get half the plays as an album that Clayman got as a single, but it will get listens mainly because It's IF. But definitely them at their worst, as ASOP had a clear theme that made it listenable, this is just strange...A clear downhill progression from ASOP, and definitely from anything prior to that.\n",
        "\nIn Flames has been well known for being one of the pioneers of the melodic death metal genre. And of course, they deserve that recognition. However, over the years, they seem to have lost their touch for what they used to do. True to its roots melodeath is not what In Flames is all about. They\u2019ve become what I guess can be called melodic alternative metal. And now, throughout the metal community, they\u2019ve received a lot of negative attention for this genre transition and one can most likely say that they\u2019ve \u201csold out.\u201d \n\nHowever, I\u2019m one of those people who tries to find the good in whatever music I listen to, sometimes it\u2019s quite hard. For this particular album, I didn\u2019t find it very difficult to find good in it. On the opposite side of the argument, in some spots I did find it very hard to enjoy. \n\nIn Flames did this with Soundtrack to Your Escape as well, put one of the album\u2019s better tracks first to catch your attention. \u201cTake this Life\u201d opens up the album and comes in with a heavy beat. The verses aren\u2019t particularly well constructed since it\u2019s basically with the same few notes played in a heavy manner while Anders is screaming over it. However, the chorus has a nice tone to it. The instrumentals have some rhyme and reason to them this part of the song and they nicely compliment Anders\u2019s singing. \n\nThroughout the album, the instruments are pretty hit and miss with their decency. In \u201cLeeches,\u201d the whole thing seems to crawl along like something that shouldn\u2019t be crawling along. The verses have almost a disgusting sound to them. However, in \u201cReflect the Storm\u201d the guitars have a great tone to them and you don\u2019t feel like your ears are bleeding. \n\nAnd what In Flames review would not say anything about Anders\u2019s vocals? As I said with the instruments, the vocals are kind of hit and miss as well. He seems to have developed a signature whine to his clean vocals that upsets metalheads to no ends. The way I see it, if it\u2019s properly complimented by the music, it\u2019s not as much of a problem. The clean vocals in \u201cCrawl Through Knives\u201d are fantastic in the chorus and you\u2019d almost swear it was a completely different person singing. Also, his screamed vocals seem to have the same effect. In some songs, they\u2019re fine. In others, they annoy the living hell out of you. \n\nI feel the title track is worth mention. \u201cCome Clarity\u201d is definitely a ballad and it is definitely played like one. A soothing acoustic intro opens up which leads to another equally soothing acoustic riff. During the verses, the instrumentals are still acoustic and Anders uses some sort of odd half-singing, half-talking voice which goes well with the tone of the song. The chorus comes in with heart melting whining singing that is one of the better uses of clean vocals on the album. The solo is very emotional and catchy at the same time. Just because this song is very un-metal, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it bad. Though same may not find this song up to par. It all depends on your opinion of ballad songs. \n\nDefinitely, the best track on the album is \u201cCrawl Through Knives.\u201d As I mentioned earlier, the clean vocals are very well executed and are the best on the album, if not, the best clean vocals by this band period. The guitars are well played and the melodies are very well written. The lyrics also reek of inspiration. The chorus is:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my hands the sky,\nSo bright it\u2019s burning,\nIt\u2019s for me to decide,\nIf flames will reach heaven tonight\u201d\n\nUsually while I hear these words I find the urge to sing along. They make one want to get up and seize the day. However, this is one of the only songs on the album where the lyrics can\u2019t be considered emotional garbage. Lyrics can be emotional as long as they are well written. This particular songs is one of those instances.\n\nAnd finally, the album comes to a close with \u201cYour Bedtime Story is Scaring Everyone.\u201d It begins with a peaceful keyboard melody that you can almost fall asleep to, and I mean that in a good way. But after two minutes or so of the same thing played over and over again, the songs explodes into a mess with, once again, Anders just kind or screaming and whining at the same time with guitars that seem to be thrown on there just to make it sound heavier. \n\nIn conclusion, Come Clarity is a decent album depending on your tolerance level of Anders\u2019s vocals and lack of brutality. Personally, I find it acceptable enough to listen to, but not enough to go out proclaiming how amazing it is. If you\u2019re a fan of their newer works, go nuts, because this album is probably for you.\n\nHighlights: \u201cCome Clarity,\u201d Crawl Through Knives\u201d\nLow Points: \u201cLeeches,\u201d \u201cYour Bedtime Story is Scaring Everyone\u201d\n",
        "\nI cannot honestly fathom how anyone can truly enjoy this from start to finish, I just can't. You can argue all day about Dark Tranquillity's overuse of electronics or At The Gates' and even Carcass' forays into a more Rock n'Roll-oriented territory, but you just know none of them sank this low. Man, what a grueling experiment in mediocrity this is. The first time I actually took time to listen to this in its whole run (45 minutes that I wholeheartedly wish I could get back) was in 2006 - just after the release of \"Come Clarity\" - and naturally, the thought of being trolled hard was the only thing that went through my mind as there was just NO WAY this was the same band that wrote \u201cColony\u201d just five years before.\n\nWas it really In Flames? Did I misread the name on the cover? Taking time to carefully read every information on my friend's CD and booklet (Yes, the only luck I had was that it wasn't mine, meaning no money from my pocket was spent on this embodiment of murder of credibility), I slowly but surely saw in horror that this WAS the same band that put out that cool album back in '99. What... The hell... Happened?\n\nFor starters, the production is the perfect antithesis of \"Clear and powerful\", being the worst these Swedes ever had. Dan Svensson's kit sounds like it was made from cheap plastic and a hollow, rotten kind of wood, being worse than Lars' tin cans on St.Anger. Also, there is a terribly irritating cymbal that pops out sometimes and sounds like a cowbell with loads of reverb. Bass drums sound like sand-filled cushions being punched and the snare is just this boxy thud that shows up after every cushion-punishing session. To distract you from the sonic madness, I recommend remembering Rocky Balboa\u2019s punching routines (only really faster) every time Dan tries some double bass runs, as the sound produced from it is pretty much the same. Unfortunately, these moments are very few in numbers, so it is up to you to imagine something other than this in order to obtain any form of enjoyment from \u201cSoundtrack to Your Escape\u201d.\n\nThe guitar sound is, simply put, atrocious. It's a fuzzy, trebly ZZZZRRRZZZ that is highly annoying to anyone trying to pay attention to the (sparse) riff work, and is yet another sign of this band's identity crisis. Damn it, you're In Flames, you're usually known for your warm, thick guitar tone and now you're pulling this crap? Stop trying to terribly emulate Dismember and do your own thing for a change! This stuff is degrading. And please forget about the bass, as it is an over distorted (a problem which would surface yet again on their next release), barely inaudible noise that is more akin to studio feedback than an actual bass guitar. Embarrassing.\n\nAwful vocal effects are used, such as this imbecile \u201cvoice coming out from a broken radio\u201d modern stuff that screams \u201cALTERNATIVE\u201d every time and gives me nausea.\nAnd please don't get me started on the vocals themselves, I beg you. This is Friden's WORST PERFORMANCE EVER, bar none. Yes, it is worse than his metalcore-influenced barks and whiny singing on \u201cCome Clarity\u201d, and worse than the college rock Jonas-Brothers-gone-heavy bullshit he pulled on \u201cA Sense of Purpose\u201d. His screams are inhumanly hoarse, as if his throat was drier than the Sahara and still he insisted to put immense strain levels on his upper palate, coming out with these raw, gut-wrenching screams that seem to precede the complete splitting of the vocal chords. The ONLY part of the album on which he returns to his old hoarse midrange rasps lasts for about four seconds and is featured on \"The Quiet Place\", from 02:56 to 03:00, but sounds more like a discrete fade-out effect than an actual effort to emulate the times of old.\n\nOh, and there is actual growling too. Yep, the low grunting stuff is actually present on \"F(r)iend\" and on a couple of other tracks, by the use of the vocal layering technique. Yes, my friends, that came out as a complete surprise to yours truly, but it served to further cement my theory that Anders ACTUALLY CAN come up with powerful vocals, but just chooses not to! We've heard it on the chorus of \"Resin\" and on the live rendition of \"F(r)iend\" on their Used and Abused DVD. He probably just likes that whole \"scream like a dying infant\" stuff despite of it sounding like shit. But hey, can't blame the man for doing what he likes or whatever. Mystery solved.\n\nI should probably mention the clean singing, but instead I invite you to read the other reviews on this page for further information, for I am sincerely tired of describing this badly done Jon Davis impersonation. It's not introspective, reflective or deep. It\u2019s just crap. Lyrically, it is all that same \u201coh I\u2019m so troubled and it hurts my heart\u201d ennui, being just a tad less emo than the stuff featured on their next album. Anders was never an excellent lyricist, but he could show at least a modicum of good taste on his previous works, but here, the sheer pedestrianism is evident and impossible to hide. You just can\u2019t save bullshit such as \u201cI wish that I could say... I wish I could be your evil in a closet\u201d, or \u201cI like you better dead, I\u2019m better off alone\u201d or everyone\u2019s favorite \u201cI can be as angry as I want to be!\u201d no matter how many silly metaphors and third-grade aphorisms you can stick into a song.\n\nAlso, notice how pretty much all songs have that \u201cYou and I\u201d lyrical dead end that traps the listener into a boring mindset and allows few other interpretation options different from \u201cHey, here\u2019s the lyricist fighting someone and getting all scared and pissed off again\u201d. If this wasn\u2019t made on purpose to target a specific (pre-pubescent, I\u2019ll wager) audience, then I\u2019m out of my freaking mind and this album has officially rendered me insane.\n\nBut the songwriting, my friends, is where STYE fails so bloody hard it becomes catastrophic. Riffs are mindless nu metal chuggers that go on and on and on with little to no progression, leads are reduced to dumb, effect-drenched noises that flow around like flies hovering rapidly around one\u2019s ears, because shrill keyboards have stolen most of their space. Remember when this band used to know where to place keyboard lines? Forget about it. Oh, and by \u201ckeyboard lines\u201d, I don\u2019t mean \u201cquiet, discrete arrangements\u201d, but distracting techno stuff that shows the band trying so damn hard to be all modern and hip that is nauseating.\n\nAs for the songs themselves, \u201cThe Quiet Place\u201d is really a techno song in a mallcore disguise, the first 30 seconds of \u201cDead Alone\u201d sound like some heavily downtuned Blink 182 song and \u201cEvil in a Closet\u201d takes Metaphor\u2019s prize for being the most asinine and idiotic ballad In Flames ever wrote. The rest of the tracks are pretty much interchangeable and go absolutely nowhere. It\u2019s funny to see the band trying to fool us by putting a hard hitting but boring song like \u201cF(r)iend\u201d at the start of the album just to follow it with \u201cThe Quiet Place\u201d, completely cocking the flow and momentum the first track tried so hard to build. Amateurish mistakes like that are abound here, unfortunately.\n\n\u201cIn Search for I\u201d goes all speedy and aggressive again only to cut the song\u2019s momentum short once again when the chorus pops up. The band seems to be at a loss about what to do here, cranking everything they\u2019ve ever done (except the acoustic stuff) into a song that is barely three minutes long and is a serious lesson in crazy, meandering songwriting. It goes quite fast, than it stops and crams stop-start riffing, layered screams, keyboards, a standard drumming pattern and a bastardized Iron Maiden lead into a convoluted mess of a chorus. Than this really simple solo that sounds more like a guitar warm-up appears out of nowhere\u2026 Anders whines some more\u2026 Another limp-wristed solo\u2026 Anders\u2026 Techno break\u2026 Final chorus AND the song is finally over, just in time to wake me up. Seriously, if you\u2019re allergic to making sense, please don\u2019t try to write music.\n\n\u201cBottled\u201d features abysmally shitty, whiny vocals and what is probably the most misplaced hook in history. Picture Pantera\u2019s \u201cWalk\u201d being played, and instead of its usual chorus you\u2019re greeted with the hook of Stratovarius\u2019 \u201cEagleheart\u201d and you\u2019ll get an idea of how this is.\n\n\u201cMy Sheet Shadow\u201d has the only enjoyable part of the album, that being the last 56 seconds where you can hear only the catchy keyboard melody without being distracted by the robotic drumming, Friden\u2019s horrid puking and the insipidly loud wall of sound created by the guitars. That\u2019s a pretty good melody, actually. If Jesper had thought of it a couple of years before, it could have turned into a great song, maybe being featured on \u201cColony\u201d or, pushing back even further, on \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d. That would\u2019ve been really neat, but no, we waste it here in this cesspool of musical vapidity. Thank you, In Flames. Again, notice how the band does its best to try to fool you by putting something similar to a non-boring riffset at the start of the song, but then, all of a sudden, you get keyboards, electronic beats and Friden\u2019s cleans. Jesus Christ. \n\nSo that\u2019s it, folks. In Flames\u2019 worst moment is here. \u201cSoundtrack to Your Escape\u201d is an album devoid of any interesting riffs, guitar leads that were one of this band\u2019s main selling points are pretty much nowhere to be found, Anders Friden has never sounded this bad and even Daniel Svensson \u2013 For many, the only good element in the band \u2013 seems to be going through the motions. Boasting an incredibly bad production job, a lack of thought-provoking lyrics, an overuse of misplaced electronics and the some of worst ideas being passed as songwriting, I believe this belongs in your trash bin, far away from \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d, \u201cColony\u201d of even \u201cClayman\u201d. Stay the hell away from this and you\u2019ll be fine. Thank you for your time.\n\nHighlights: The last 56 seconds of \u201cMy Sweet Shadow\u201d and the chorus of \u201cF(r)iend\u201d.\n",
        "\nFrom the mixed auditory bag that was the substandard \u201cA Sense Of Purpose\u201d are a number of songs that just sort of fly by without need of further attention. They were relatively few, but represent the middle ground between the best and worst elements of what was going on, and largely come off as filler alongside the marginally decent and utterly terrible. \u201cDelight And Angers\u201d is a classic example of one of these songs, a song that is just sort of there, and doesn\u2019t really inspire any kind of an emotional response.\n\nFrom a stylistic standpoint, it is another of a long line of mid-tempo, rock infused songs that could be all but interchangeable with a number of popular metalcore bands, except for all of the layering on of additional melodic guitar lines and frequent changeups in the riff work. Indeed, the instrumental version of this song is actually the highlight as it lacks the obnoxious microphone mouthing and voice cracking of the band\u2019s dreadlock toting Swede and gives the listener a chance to fully comprehending what\u2019s going on behind the sucking, and it\u2019s actually a fairly fun listen for a metalcore song.\n\nAs much as this is a better single and better song than a number of this band\u2019s poorly conceived fits of mainstream whoring, this is not something that is worth any kind of currency except maybe the kind that jingles. An astute ear can hear the busy and somewhat wasted talent going on behind Anders\u2019 audition material for the latest AFI album meets Matt Heafy with laryngitis, though most probably won\u2019t want to.\n",
        "\nIt should be noted before anything else is said that the score I give this release reflects the merits of its contents, and should not be taken to reflect whether or not this is a worthy thing to track down in its analog form, because it really isn\u2019t. This is a release that largely attempts to placate older fans of the band and show them the parallels between their recent attempt at hybrid metalcore and melodeath music, and in this effort it is mostly a failure. The divide between Anders\u2019 whimpering clean vocals and thin screams alone set a huge divide between the still largely dark and deep (though still sloppy and mediocre) barks that still were present on \u201cClayman\u201d, which is only further aggravated by the non-metal image that the band puts forth on the music video for the title song.\n\nNevertheless, \u201cCome Clarity\u201d is one of those rare occurrences where a metalcore half-ballad is actually an enjoyable listen. Most of it relies on a very catchy and well put together acoustic guitar theme that drives the song along, accompanied by one of the more coherent clean vocal displays I\u2019ve heard since \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d. It\u2019s more of a alternative rock song than a metal song, but for what it is, it is pretty solid and definitely runs rings around bands like Breaking Benjamin or Saliva whenever they try to do stuff like this. \u201cOnly For The Weak\u201d seems a very odd choice for the b-side, as it was among the closest to a full out reversion to \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d than most of the other material on \u201cClayman\u201d. \u201cBullet Ride\u201d probably would have been the better choice, but as an individual song, it shows a band that still had some of its traditional metal credentials in order, even when at a slower tempo.\n\nPerhaps the best way to fully understand the huge distance the respective eras of this band have with each other is to watch the music videos for each song. One is clearly a metal band playing something that can be traced back to its roots in the 80s, while the other has maybe some tenuous connections with 80s hardcore, but is largely a newer and very different phenomenon that most metal heads can not identify with unless they were under the age of 16 when this came out. But as for the album itself, it might be worth getting if happened upon in vinyl form if one is really interested in hearing the band through that medium, but otherwise a copy of \u201cClayman\u201d and a lucky break at catching the title song\u2019s music video on MTV will suffice.\n",
        "\nRave music has never agreed with my ears. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the quirky electronic sounds, the hypnotic beats, or the sheer banality of the occasional melodies that play support to the obnoxiously loud beats, but somewhere between the sum and the parts my head begins to pound with the fury of a thousand volcanoes and I experience the young adult equivalent of acid reflux disease. Suffice to say, In Flames\u2019 2004 abortion \u201cSoundtrack To Your Escape\u201d was loaded with enough elements of this rubbish to force me to go through a whole case of Tums. But the total contents of their worst LP actually sounds like the sweet and succulent metal of \u201cPowerslave\u201d compared to the glow-in-the-dark, pill popping mush that was saved for this sad excuse for an EP/single.\n\nThe obvious offender of a title song is a classic example of the most concentrated extreme of the weaknesses on In Flames\u2019 sad little album that it is derived from. Spearheaded by a vapid mixture of droning keyboard lines, effects drenched guitars that might as well be keyboards, and a few chug riffs that do little other than try to add some additional punch to an already obnoxiously overloud and groovy drum beat. But not to be a band sparing the audience of a much needed double whammy, the ridiculously overproduced, computer generated music video that features Anders in his newfound white boy with dreadlocks glory is also included. This was unfortunately my first introduction to the band within the music video format, and gave me yet another excuse to mock a few people I knew who worshiped this band while mocking the 80s stuff I listen to.\n\nHaving said all of that, the real garbage the inspired my complete revulsion for this release is the full fledged, utterly terrible remix of \u201cMy Sweet Shadow\u201d. There are a few guitars in this song, but barely, leaving the vast majority of this song to be dominated by a slew of video gamey sounding electronic drums and electronic trance music, leaving us not forget Anders\u2019 frightening renditions of semi-clean shouted vocalizations. I literally think that this song qualifies as the longest 4 \u00bd minutes of agony in my life, and my poor esophagus is still feeling the burn from all the stomach acid that was rushing up to my chest. Rounding out the mix is a pointless live version of an acoustic ditty and some studio footage affording us more time to admire the flirtations with an emo crybaby image with latent traces of wiggerdom in the case of the helmsman.\n\nIt is easy to hate a release like this if you hold metal in any level of esteem, though explaining why is a painful endeavor. I could see some of the songs that appeared on \u201cSoundtrack\u201d as being defensible on the grounds that they are more metalcore than techno, but the handful of die-hard In Flames fan boys that I occasionally encounter who cry out heresy the minute this emperor\u2019s nakedness is pointed out in all its wrinkly old person glory, can only be passed off as hardness of hearing. An enema being performed on this thing would literally leak a decrepit mixture of glowing necklaces and Linkin Park members, so don\u2019t even bother and leave this crapshoot in the dark sewage pool it originally rose out of.\n",
        "\nTo state that In Flames underwent a strong paradigm shift with the release of \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d is an understatement. But to fully understand why, it is necessary to understand that in spite of a fairly commercial sound going back even to 1997, the band didn\u2019t dabble in pointless single releases in addition to the usual music video promotion until this, the first in a long stream of poorly conceived attempts at cashing out on the synth-crazed, modern metal blunder that had ensued. There\u2019s not much to describe, but some things that should probably be explained.\n\nWhile the spirit of \u201cCloud Connected\u201d seems to want to be melodeath, the overtly prominent outliers in the band\u2019s sound are hugely problematic. While the techno-like keyboard themes and overblown atmospheric industrial elements are not unique to bands like Deftones and others of the mainline nu-metal persuasion, the combination of them with Frid\u00e9n\u2019s obnoxiously whiny vocals and the mechanical, hyper-repetitive riffs definitely show favoritism towards that audience. Nevertheless, the content is still there to qualify this as metal, albeit it\u2019s heavily diluted, and the music video included features the band looking like a bunch of aimless wanders amidst an updated version of a Foo Fighters video.\n\nUltimately the name of the game here is pointless, and in spite of a not quite horrific title song and a mediocre live rendition of \u201cColony\u201d from their tour in Korea, which features Anders sounding more and more like a nu-metal singer, this is not something that should be bothered with. Sure, the b-side can\u2019t be found anywhere else, but why even waste time seeking out a song that done better a year ago on a decent live rendition in \u201cThe Tokyo Showdown\u201d. Look there or somewhere else for the fan fodder you seek, and leave this cash grab in the dust where it belongs.\n",
        "\nThe concept of the live album, in a metal context, has been the subject of little variation. The general formula, as earlier established by mainstays from Black Sabbath to Manowar, is to play up the audience participation and to not only modify studio songs for the sake of surprising and involving the audience, but also to shorten and combine them in order to get more material into a shorter duration. Though song selection naturally plays a pivotal role alongside this tendency to include the audience, production takes a critical role, and all but demands a sound conducive to a theatrical setting with plenty of crowd noise and applause. In all of these respects, In Flames\u2019 well known live offering \u201cThe Tokyo Showdown\u201d could be considered the opposite of a live album, and it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nWhile it is all well and good to hear the screaming of thousands upon thousands of faithful Brazilian metal heads on a Helloween live album, or hear Ronnie James Dio humbly featuring the audience for a sing along, sometimes you just want to hear the band. In this, the album is a very massive success, offering up something that sounds like a small venue gig, even though it most likely was not given the popularity of the band at this point. There\u2019s a bit of an overemphasis on the drums and the bass is uncharacteristically loud compared to all of the studio versions of these songs, but this doesn\u2019t wholly detract from the overall feel of things. The only thing that really kind of drags on the quality of these songs is that Friden\u2019s emo tendencies (which exploded a year later on \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d) have seeped into what were originally supposed to be quiet spoken lines, particularly on that of \u201cBullet Ride\u201d and \u201cOrdinary Story\u201d.\n\nOne thing has to be handed to this band, regardless of whether or not the contents of \u201cWhoralce\u201d through \u201cClayman\u201d were well received by your ears (as these albums dominate this offering), this is a very faithful and consistent presentation of the driving, somewhat power metal-like tendency of this era of the band. Absent perhaps the amplified presence given by studio tweaks and enhanced keyboard ambiences (the latter of which is heavily downplayed on here), this is what these songs likely would have sounded like had they been recorded in one take, save Anders attempting to involve the audience a little bit at the beginning of \u201cSwim\u201d. The renditions of such hard hitting speeders like \u201cClayman\u201d, \u201cScorn\u201d and \u201cPinball Map\u201d feature exquisite guitar work and might encourage some involuntary horn throwing. The classics \u201cMoonshield\u201d and \u201cBeyond Space\u201d are also nicely realized, though the acoustic elements have been either omitted or electrified, and songs I\u2019m not terribly keen on like \u201cJotun\u201d and \u201cEpisode 666\u201d sound energetic and lively, probably due to the superior kit abilities of Dan Svensson.\n\nIt is somewhat strange to be dissenting on this point, but this is actually among the better In Flames releases during their middle era, and it is definitely a somewhat surprising breath of fresh air in an endless stream of live albums where bands seek to overemphasize the audience reaction. This is not to say that the roar of applause in a massive arena is a bad thing, but it is refreshing to hear a band focus on what the audience is actually focused on during the concert, and that is the music. Those who want pure melodeath will have to try and hunt down the split live album with Darkseed and EverEve, but for the less fussy and conservative types, this is slightly inferior but still fun album by a band that was still in the game.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s a rare thing for a band to outdo itself before it is fully established, but it does happen from time to time. For most fans of harder edged metal, Helloween can be seen as a crowning example as their early speed metal work with Kai Hansen at the helm tend to be more strongly heralded than the higher fidelity, vocally polished incarnation that paved the way for present European power metal (\u201cThe Keepers\u201d albums). In much the same way, In Flames has had this odd habit of hitting pay dirt during their non-full length releases, and the EP length demo that preceded their competent and intricate debut \u201cLunar Strain\u201d is the prototypical example of it.\n\nIt is fairly easy to see how In Flames was able to land themselves in the midst of a notable revolution in the early 90s, as an independently produced product of this quality was probably not easy to come by before the days of widely distributed recording studio software. The dimensions that make up this chilling breeze of a sound are very clearly defined and audible, literally to the point where the band\u2019s largely neglected bass player can be very clearly heard amidst the usual mess of tremolo riffs, blast beats and mid-pitched shouts. In fact, apart from the raspy and almost frostbitten roars of Mikael Stanne, this could almost be qualified as posh and power metal-like, particularly in comparison to the coinciding releases of At The Gates at this point.\n\nNevertheless, as far as In Flames offerings go, this is the clearest example of the band\u2019s link to the broader genre of death metal, as well as a display of their varied stylistic devices. \u201cUpon An Oaken Throne\u201d is a bit more tuneful and less chaotic, but an examination of the dimensions of the song and the usage of somewhat occult oriented atmospheric devices, reveals a band that has a familiarity with Morbid Angel\u2019s \u201cAltars Of Madness\u201d. By contrast, the acoustic intro to \u201cIn Flames\u201d (which was cut from the \u201cLunar Strain\u201d version) and the 30 second lead up to \u201cClad In Shadows\u201d demonstrate a folksy tendency that predates the majestic melodeath meets Viking glory of Ensiferum and Suidakra by a good 3 or 4 years.\n\nUltimately what emerges here is actually a better version of what was present on \u201cLunar Strain\u201d. Although definitely varied within the short duration of music it carries, this isn\u2019t nearly as all over the place and heavy on the instrumental meandering as the studio debut, and contains a humbler production that is a bit more in line with the practices of late 80s to early 90s bands that paved the way towards this band. When the question of \u201cWhat does In Flames have to do with death metal?\u201d gets asked, this is what I always point to, and given that it is available along with the reissue of \u201cLunar Strain\u201d, I think I\u2019ll point in that direction for any who are interested in hearing Iron Maiden meets Death.\n",
        "\nThough it may be hard to fathom today, there was a time when In Flames wasn\u2019t synonymous with pandering to nu-metal brats and trying to beat them at their own game. Opinions vary as to where the band started to go wrong, but it is definitely clear to any and all with even a slight interest in Gothenburg metal that things were at their peak before \u201cWhoracle\u201d. While some might shy away from the band\u2019s second EP \u201cBlack Ash Inheritance\u201d due to its close proximity to said third album, the truth is that this is clearly a release firmly rooted in the short span when the music surrounding Anders Frid\u00e9n\u2019s somewhat sloppy vocals was top notch, ergo it is in the same vain as \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d.\n\nAnyone who was familiar with the positive aspects of the band\u2019s sophomore full length, the non-album songs found on here are an even more effective reassertion of that same winning formula. For the most part, the name of the game is atmospherics and melody, while the riffs tend to be consonant and easy flowing and the rhythm section is somewhat looser and slower, as opposed to the driving feel that came in with the new lineup on \u201cColony\u201d. They differ a little in scope, notably that the featured opener \u201cGoliaths Disarm Their Davids\u201d is among the busier and more technical of In Flames\u2019 offerings and features a very picturesque clean electric guitar intro, while \u201cGyroscope\u201d is a bit more compact and comes with an acoustic intro, but they ram the same general point of catchiness and majestically grim landscapes home.\n\nThe contents that round out the duration of this little afterthought aren\u2019t necessarily slouches either. The all acoustic instrumental number, while not having a terribly compelling name, the dreary atmosphere and droning harmony lines that are reminiscent of several ballad sections on \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d (particularly that of the first two songs on said LP) and work perfectly even when in a small sub-3 minute package. The live rendition of \u201cBeyond Space\u201d is well accomplished and surprisingly well mixed, particularly given the band\u2019s tendency towards poor live recordings, and only come up short in Anders\u2019 vocal performance. In truth, the only thing holding this back is the weak renditions of the extreme-thrash/proto-death metal shouts of the vocalist the band has saddled itself with.\n\nWhile standing on its own this is the best offering of In Flames\u2019 career after \u201cSubterranean\u201d, the prudent buyer will simply pick up the 2002 reissue of \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d which also has this EP. Put together, they represent the only utterly essential purchase of the Frid\u00e9n era, though the next 3 albums aren\u2019t necessarily throwaways if sought at lower than introductory prices. It might not ascend to the level of the early classics of At The Gates, but it represents a very viable companion to any quality release by them or Dark Tranquillity for any newcomer to Gothenburg who have qualms about this band given their recent output.\n",
        "\nI never really liked the death metal genre but as strange things seem to happen, I accidentally heard the single \"The mirror's truth\" and was blown away by the song's energy and sharp riffs, its harmonic guitar solo parts in the key of Iron Maiden and the catchy chorus in short and sweet three minutes. I later decided to buy this album and got an introduction to a whole new genre.\n\nThere are a few other strange things that happen. In Flames is a very popular band, one can easily recognize this by the number of reviews that have been written about the band on the metal archives. But most of the reviews are negative and most of the albums have just an average rating around sixty percent or even less so that I ask myself why so many people listen to this if it is only mediocre or even worse. Another thing that I can't understand is the fact that this band gets low ratings but the mall core poser of Children of Boredom got quite high ratings. \n\nWhen I decided to buy this album I wasn't sure whether the album would satisfy me or not and I didn't have any true expectations. I bought this by intuition or instinct and it was the right choice. This album is extremely diversified and courageous and most people seem to have problems with this. True and grim death metal fans get scared by acoustic guitars or ballads, somewhat like the elephant that is frightened by the mouse. Personally, as a fan of progressive and melodic music, I adore this album.\n\nYou have many different kinds of styles on this record. Fast and pitiless killers like the highly emotional \"Disconnected\", the haunting and melancholic atmosphere of \"Sleepless again\" and \"Delight and angers\", the surprising breaks and acoustic guitar parts of the brilliant \"Alias\", the melodic catchiness of \"The mirror's truth\" or \"March to the shore\" and finally the innovating, weird and very unusual ballad \"The chosen pessimist\" that has a slight \u201cemo\u201d touch. I usually hate \u201cemo\u201d music and other stuff, but this ballad is haunting, hypnotizing and inspiring. I never expected such a song from such a band. That's why adored this album, because it didn't stop to leave me stunning. You have to be quite open-minded to accept and like this album, it takes some time before you truly begin to appreciate it but once you are open to get into this album, you will live a great experience and strange things happen. Surely, there are also a couple of fillers towards the end of the record like the perfectly entitled \"Sober and irrelevant\" for example. But the album as a whole is very entertaining. This album was one of the best positive surprises of the last years to me and I have since taken a look on other bands of the same kind.\n\nI highly recommend this album to people that aren't normally that much into the genre and rather prefer classic heavy metal, power metal or progressive stuff as they may get surprised by this record. To have an idea, check out \"The mirror's truth\", \"Alias\" and \"The chosen pessimist\", probably the best songs on this record to me. Traditional death metal fans may be warned, as this album is very diversified, melodic and progressive and there is not much straight forward anger to find in here.\n",
        "\nThe immediate aftermath of \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d can be easily recognized, even by steadfast fans of In Flames, as the low point in said bands turbulent career. And right smack in the middle of this freefall is the infamous \u201cTrigger\u201d EP, probably the most concentrated dose of nu-metal and non-metal tendencies of anything ever to be passed off as an album by the same band that brought us \u201cSubterranean\u201d and \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d. It is quite perplexing that anyone claiming to be a fan of melodeath, or even a power metal fan who took an interest in this band earlier in their career, could launch a defense of this, but through the years, this has actually happened.\n\nLaunching off this rather unfortunate bastard is a pair of stylistic holdovers from the widely criticized directional shift \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d. The edited version of the title song, for lack of any real distinction from its studio album version, is the best song on here. The amount of riff oriented stylistic holdover from \u201cClayman\u201d and \u201cColony\u201d are pretty obvious, in spite of the heavy keyboard elements and Fear Factory inspired clean vocal chorus, and drive things along fairly well. The non-album song that follows \u201cWatch Them Feed\u201d is fast and somewhat thrashing, but the riff set sounds extremely dumbed down and nu-metal oriented. In fact, I\u2019ve often heard people mistake this song for Slipknot\u2019s \u201cBefore I Forget\u201d, though these are often followed by claims that In Flames stole the idea from their favorite nu-metal band in spite of the fact that it came out 1 year prior, so the intelligence of those making the comparison is questionable.\n\nThe further things progress, the more mechanized the sound of this becomes. The really bad rendition of Genesis\u2019 \u201cLand Of Confusion\u201d is a pure travesty to the practice of metal-oriented covers of non-metal songs, perhaps topped only by the pseudo-metal rendition that Disturbed offered up several years later. The metalcore sounding screams and flat sounding clean vocals destroy any sense of melody the song has, and the hypnotic yet sloppy guitar work does little to compensate. This is followed by two gloriously terrible techno renditions of two original songs, one of them a recent one that was bad to begin with, the other an unassailable classic that is bastardized into an almost completely synthetic collage of noise. It\u2019s bad enough that these guys can\u2019t seem to stop themselves from self-plagiarizing \u201cMoonshield\u201d in order to fill up albums, but here they\u2019ve actually resorted to butchering it for a pointless EP release.\n\nRave junkies and Slipknot worshipers might go for this sort of rubbish, but I don\u2019t, and neither should you. It would be more advisable to get a bargain copy of \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d and suffer through the original versions of the two modified ones found on here and count yourself lucky that you didn\u2019t have to suffer the rest of the decrepit drivel on here. I didn\u2019t quite have the heart to completely bomb this thing since the title song, even in this inferior form, has some musical merit. But this is about as close to pure musical revulsion as In Flames has ever gotten, and it should not be encouraged with your hard earned cash.\n",
        "\nIn Flames has suffered from a dilemma over the past couple of years, which could be called the \u201cwe can\u2019t write a full length album without going all over the place\u201d dilemma. The general trend has been, the longer the band goes on, the further away from being focused they tend to be, ironically so considering the album title \u201cCome Clarity\u201d. But within the EP format, which has agreed quite well with this band in the past, seems to be free from inconsistency, though not necessarily free from being consistently bad depending on the album. \u201cThe Mirror\u2019s Truth\u201d falls into the consistently good category, at least when considering the current stylistic paradigm they have.\n\nIt is well known that the current sound of the band is a bastardized version of their latter 90s sound with a quirky blend of metalcore and industrial/ambient influences. What is perhaps not well known is that this sound can actually work fairly well in small doses, particularly when the ballad elements are downplayed and the whiny, melodramatic clean vocals are minimized. And this is basically the approach that the bulk of this EP takes, and when those weaker elements do occur, they are mercifully quick and actually somewhat complementary to the song. Keeping things compact and within the 3-4 minute time length is generally the way to go here, and an attention to quality ideas as well as their quantity.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the somewhat muddled title song is the weak link in this equation, owing in no small part to the groovy, Trivium-like riff that kicks off the album. When the harmonic lead passages sneak in, things get a bit better, but first impressions are a huge element of a song like this working, and a bad intro can sink an otherwise decent song. \u201cAbnegation\u201d and \u201cTilt\u201d take a somewhat upper mid-tempo approach and are drenched with layers of lead guitar work, but have that nice blend of catchiness and energy that made many of the slower songs on \u201cClayman\u201d work well. But the absolute high point of this is \u201cEraser\u201d, which pummels with the speed of a thrash song, yet is as catchy as your standard German power metal song circa 2001. This is one of very few post-2001 songs by this band that I actually put into my In Flames playlists regularly, despite the divergence in vocal quality, from what little there was to begin with.\n\nInstead of wasting money getting \u201cA Sense Of Purpose\u201d at full or even 75% of the price, the smart money would go with picking up this nice little EP, or getting the Japanese version of their 9th album which contains all of these songs as bonus tracks. If this band ever does decide to revert back to their older sound, this would be the precursor to that happening, though more likely it\u2019s just an aberration amidst a sea of lackluster modern pop/rock infused metal. But regardless, it showcases yet again that, when they want to, this band is capable of getting their act together.\n",
        "\nWhen a band\u2019s history becomes somewhat extensive, contention becomes inevitable even when the sound remains relatively consistent. In Flames, however, seems to have reveled in the idea of pissing off people, at least that\u2019s the impression that comes from the past few albums they\u2019ve put out. They have this unique ability of articulating through their songwriting that they still possess the ability to make decent music, while simultaneously affirming as loudly as possible that they have little intention of doing so, for no other reason that they can. They might have a bit more airplay with the material they\u2019ve put out, but apples to apples, the appeal of their old sound vs. the new on is about equal in terms of accessibility, thus the continuing success of their counterparts Dark Tranquillity.\n\nThis is all relevant because their latest offering, a rather schizophrenic mishmash of metalcore and electronic music with some traces of melodeath called \u201cA Sense Of Purpose\u201d, is one of the more frustrating albums ever put out. Apart from the dreadfully comical sense of artistic surrealism out of a bad graphic novel cover art, which reminds a bit of the containment imagery of the latest Korn abortion, this is a tough album to judge as either decent or drivel. There will be a good idea here that almost begins to remind of \u201cClayman\u201d, while another will immediately follow that reminds us all that \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d is still dominating much of the songwriting process of this band. Somewhere after the horrid \u201cSoundtrack To Your Escape\u201d this bunch got the idea that mixing together old ideas with new ones will suffice to satisfy everybody, and just like with \u201cCome Clarity\u201d, the results are very inconsistent.\n\nFrom one song to the next, this is a constant exercise in a band refusing to make up their mind on what they want to sound like, and trying to pass it off as brilliance in genre hybridization. This literally jumps out right at the onset of \u201cThe Mirror\u2019s Truth\u201d, which starts off with a grating groove riff that sounds partially stolen from Papa Roach, then the drums kick in on overdrive and a few interchanges of melodic hooks fly through with all the Iron Maiden trappings to boot, all eventuating in a chorus that sounds like an outtake from \u201cMoonshield\u201d with semi-clean hardcore vocals. This is the sort of song that would be solid if they just knocked off the stupid groovy chug breakdowns and kept things moving. \u201cDisconnected\u201d actually takes the opposite approach and starts of cooking with a nice thrash riff and some high octane drumming, and then after about 35 seconds just starts coasting in groove territory and sounding like Killswitch Engage with keyboards. Can you guys make up your minds please?\n\nThe general rule of this album is, the shorter the song, the less time there is to meander around and lose any sense of stylistic continuity. While probably being, at best, a couple of rejects from \u201cClayman\u201d, the speed infused yet still groovy \u201cI\u2019m The Highway\u201d and \u201cMarch To The Shore\u201d are among the best examples of this band at least writing a decent song with metalcore vocals that can be followed without feeling like Jonathan Davis and company are raping your eardrums. \u201cSober And Irrelevant\u201d is largely the same story, though they do a better job here of avoiding that grating rhythmic slam sound that normally dominates their verses. Had they simply avoided writing overlong, almost alternative rock sounding crap like \u201cThe Chosen Pessimist\u201d and deemphasized the percussive 2 chord crap during the vocal sections, this album might actually have surpassed \u201cCome Clarity\u201d and perhaps bee worthy of picking up.\n\nThere are a lot of things going on here, but one thing that is definitely not going on here is a consistent identity. It\u2019s pretty easy to despise Frid\u00e9n\u2019s emo driven clean vocals, but coming up with a pure negative or positive reaction to the entirety of this disjointed release is actually a pretty daunting task. It\u2019s a pretty safe bet that anyone who hated \u201cCome Clarity\u201d should avoid this album as well, with the stupid homage to \u201cWhere The Wild Things Are\u201d album art being extra incentive not to have this in a disc collection. But speaking for myself, this is a pretty even mix of good and bad, and I can\u2019t say that I love it or hate it. Like many mainstream efforts, it is offensive in its inoffensiveness, though knowing what these musicians were capable of in the past should add a level of ire in most.\n",
        "\nThere was a sickness that rapidly began permeating the airwaves in the mid 2000s, flying under the banner of gothic/industrial metal, yet having a bit more in common with the bumbling nu-metal/mallcore tendencies of Korn and Deftones. Actually, both of said bands have been helping to propagate this odd notion of synthesizer driven industrial music with groovy, hypnotic chug riffs that are about as somniferous as a gallon of warm milk. There is no quicker way to get noticed by the snot nosed legions of the music video hipster crowd than a few good over-processed guitar groove riffs and a whinny vocal display with occasional hints at pseudo-tough guy shouting. And in much the same fashion as Machine Head did earlier in the decade, In Flames seems to have elected to jump on the bandwagon and beat the trend leaders at their own game.\n\n\u201cSoundtrack To Your Escape\u201d is a really bad exercise in stylistic fence straddling that makes \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d look good by comparison. While the same annoying combination of poorly realized pseudo-death screams and pretty boy emo clean singing is revolting the ears, the band has really decided to put the keyboards up in the mix and have come out with something that borderlines on rave music at times. Further compounding the issue is the band\u2019s desire to give off some semblance of still being metal influenced, particularly in the vain of a somewhat diligent metalcore outfit, and have come up with something that is still somewhat complex and guitar happy, though not quite so much in the traditional melodic form of before. What really separates this from the usual drudgery heard out of today\u2019s mainstream acts is that there are about 3 times as many groove riffs, but sadly quantity does not necessarily lead to quality, nor does complexity for that matter.\n\nUltimately, there are a couple of songs on here that seem to desire a more metallic audience, but otherwise the dimensions of this are a singular one where mid-tempo land and flat rhythmic chugging are the rule of the day. \u201cIn Search For I\u201d remembers the speed that was there in the days of \u201cColony\u201d and makes the most regular use of guitar harmony amidst the percussive tendencies of the song. There\u2019s a few electronic sections where one almost feels like an Evanescence song sneaked into the play list with Friden\u2019s bratty bellowing still blaring through the vocal tracks. \u201cSuperhero Of The Computer Rage\u201d is also somewhat good in a semi-thrashing way, and keeps cooking fairly consistently. But apart from this an a few token fast sections littered in a few other songs, there is little reason to even fake at raising the horns, and probably a lot of reason to put black nail polish and eyeliner on while cursing the day you got your Y chromosome.\n\nIf nothing else, this is an album that ensures everyone that, contrary to the ponderings of a few wacky avant-garde philosophers, that contradictions can not exist in reality. A duck doesn\u2019t become a guinea pig if you put a little fur coat on it, a cadaver doesn\u2019t spring up to life from snake oil, and mallcore doesn\u2019t sound good if it\u2019s packed to the brim with more active guitar lines. No changing of the vocal guard would have saved this confused pile of commercial pandering, nor would increasing the number of guitar solos cure the inherent vapidity of the music supporting Anders\u2019 depressed teeny bopper soliloquies. People like to joke about this being an album to escape from, but in reality it\u2019s a failed attempt at escaping responsibility in putting out something worth listening to. My condolences to any and all die-hard fans of Gothenburg\u2019s original sound who suffered through this.\n",
        "\nSo I've read most of the reviews that were below a 75 because i wasn't sure how people could pin this album as being anything less than that. Honestly this album was great. By far my least favorable album from In Flames but nevertheless, amazing. \n\nWhat people don't understand about In Flames, especially Anders, is that they're not satisfied with sounding the same on every album. They like to change their sound. Think about Cannibal Corpse for a second. When you feel like listening to them you grab your Ipod, or whatever, and probably hit shuffle on the band because Cannibal Corpse is Cannibal Corpse regardless of what album is playing. And i'm not knocking them at all because they are awesome.\n\nWhat i'm getting at is that for In Flames it's the complete opposite. Your in the mood for In Flames... but what album is almost too hard to pick surely. The range that the band can cover within melodic death metal is fucking huge! A Sense of Purpose is a big leap from Come Clarity and an exponentially bigger leap from The Jesters Race. People that despise this album have a way too singular mind and are stuck on older albums.\n\nWith A Sense of Purpose In Flames managed to keep away from being lumped into a pile of melodic death metal. They maintained their image as In Flames with this album. Meaning that their music stayed extremely unique. Even though they are one of the founders of melodic death metal it's damn near impossible to feel like they stand out from the vast crowd of melodic death metal bands such as Dark Tranquility and Soilwork. In Flames is an extremely original group of guys and this album only further proved that while still sounding great.\n\nThe album itself is full of new and amazing sounds and concepts. especially the lyrics. Anders is a genius when it comes to writing complex lyrics. never are they simplistic and the lyrics off this album are so different from the others but still mystical and intriguing. The album is lighter, that much is for sure, but still it contains some extremely fast parts and deep sounds. Drenched In Fear is a great example of this. In this song it is easy to see parallels with F(r)iend, especially when Anders growls deep such as when he says; \"brand new armor\". this song as well as many others off the album get my blood pumping and fill me with a sense of confidence.\n\nDo not listen to this album seeking the brutality of The Jesters Race, but instead listen to it and really think about how In Flames is even still expanding the world of melodic death metal. Music is a living thing and In Flames is the heart behind melodic death metal.\n",
        "\nThe controversy that is In Flames\u2019 entire career is well known amongst extreme metal circles, in part because they ushered in an era of commercialized music that came to be the least extreme variant on the outer fringes of aggressive metal. This criticism is perhaps mostly apparent amongst orthodox death metal affiliates, who saw albums such as \u201cLunar Strain\u201d, \u201cSkydancer\u201d and perhaps even \u201cWith Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness\u201d as being 100% departures from the genre whose name was still touted as being that of the bands in question. To be fair, while the melodic content was a lot more informed by the consonance of early to mid 80s metal than even the lighter albums put out by Death and Carcass at this time, the overall asymmetrical structural tendencies and presentation still kept enough of the practices of the late 80s and early 90s death metal sound to be noticeable.\n\nIn terms of death metal tradition, \u201cSubterranean\u201d is actually much closer to the free flowing, extreme thrash infused style that Death had been tinkering with since \u201cSpiritual Healing\u201d than \u201cLunar Strain\u201d. Usage of acoustic passages and keyboards, which are not completely out of character even for certain Florida acts like Nocturnus, or even that of Morbid Angel when proceeding a bit later in their career. But it should be noted that although the riff assault utilizes a similarly frenetic tremolo character with blast beats raging and thrashing goodness coming in for a needed contrast within the louder passages, the melodic contour is far less chromatic. In fact, when listening to the more blinding passages on \u201cEver Dying\u201d and \u201cBiosphere\u201d there is a casual familiarity in the guitar work with the blackened landscapes of \u201cIn The Nightside Eclipse\u201d and \u201cStormblast\u201d, though the production practices are not quite as frosty and obscured. Even the garbled screams of one-time vocal helmsman Henke Forss, who happens to be the best vocalist this band has ever had, seems a bit more informed by the sepulchral ravings of Shagrath than any of the Florida or Sweden based death metal mainstays.\n\nWhile there is clear genre blending at work here, it is also important to keep in mind that this is still a Gothenburg album, and has all of the usual elements at play, albeit far better executed than later offerings. The mishmash of Iron Maiden influenced guitar melodies, occasional folksy and classically influenced harmonic clich\u00e9s, and the occasional odd twist into semi-happy/triumphant territory pops up. \u201cStand Ablaze\u201d could almost be classified as a somewhat power metal oriented song between the Baroque-influenced counterpoint going on in the guitar harmonies, and along with it a share of minimalist riffs that are somewhat reminiscent of early German metal ala Running Wild. The intro of said song, along with the ending of \u201cEver Dying\u201d and the entirety of \u201cTimeless\u201d shows the typical mixture of acoustic work and sound effects, presented in more of a somber traditional fashion rather than the industrial electronic that began seeping in circa \u201cClayman\u201d.\n\nTo anyone who has not heard In Flames prior to the release of \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d, this will probably come off as being an entirely different band, and in several respects that is a correct notion. This is music that, while not being the most extreme brand out there, is far from the commercial safeness that has tended to typify this band. This is something that could maybe stand toe to toe with some of the 2nd wave black metal albums that came out at around this time, though the audience being played to here will probably have a greater affinity with the least grim and frostbitten and more melodic variants of said movement. It is perhaps a bittersweet notion that this band did their best work on a short EP, but nevertheless, this is a band that actually did have a brush with greatness, if only one single time.\n",
        "\nThis is a challenging album, and definitely not so in the most obvious of ways. Some albums are challenging to like, some are challenging to understand, and some are even challenging to hate if society deems it garbage and a few individuals disagree but still want to fit in. But this is an album that is challenging to dislike for the right reasons, and while many can properly point out the problems in the midst of a blinding rage, keeping one\u2019s sense of proportionality is difficult. Even the most rabid of \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d and \u201cLunar Strain\u201d fans should keep in mind that buried under a lot of really unnecessary additives and overindulgent drama is actually a pretty decent album, but like with any elaborate cuisine in a given hybrid genre, too much of certain ingredients or a couple things that don\u2019t belong can turn a tasty dish into a pile of disgusting mush.\n\nSince the release of \u201cColony\u201d and the addition of drummer Daniel Svensson, In Flames has played a hybrid of power metal and melodeath that is fairly similar to more keyboard oriented Finnish outfits like Children Of Bodom and Norther. They aren\u2019t nearly as flashy and generally tend to rely more on guitar harmonies than atmospheric keyboards, but the spirit was basically the same, and \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d still carries the same basic template insofar as the majority of the non-vocal parts go. It has been rightly pointed out that several of these songs contain fragments of ideas that were heard back in the 90s, most notably the principle guitar line on \u201cMetaphor\u201d which draws dangerously close to the intro of \u201cMoonshield\u201d. This song also has the misfortune of being covered with a really whinny clean vocal performance out of Anders Frid\u00e9n, and throws out the climactic distorted sections in favor of a full out sappy ballad with a distant, droning violin line, and herein lays the area where this album runs into serious trouble.\n\nThe formula at work in this band\u2019s repertoire has always been simplistic, barring perhaps the experimental tendencies of the pre-Frid\u00e9n era, and things aren\u2019t that much different here. The riff work is a bit further simplified, but still largely consonant and animated, and the rhythm section still maintains that fast paced power metal edge. The only critical flaw in this category is that Svensson\u2019s snare and cymbal tracking is tending towards the popping and ringing characteristic more commonly heard in metalcore circles. But apart from this and maybe a few clunkers like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cSystem\u201d being heavily groove oriented, almost to the point of being bad Pantera songs, there is little to be offended by here unless the material following \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d really didn\u2019t agree with you. Certain songs like \u201cTrigger\u201d, \u201cDismiss The Cynics\u201d and \u201cDark Signs\u201d are actually consistently good throughout, from an instrumental perspective, really accenting the melodic guitars and some decent keyboard additives, and could probably have made \u201cClayman\u201d without greatly detracting from its overall quality.\n\nThe real folly comes into play when dealing with the vocal work, which while not all that more offensive to the ears than the semi-moaning spoken lines heard on \u201cClayman\u201d, is presented in such a way that the continuity of the songs is thrown off. Perfectly good fast paced numbers like the title song \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d, \u201cDrifter\u201d and \u201cEgonomic\u201d begin attacking the ears with the blazing goodness of a late 90s melodeath fest, but collapse into these horrid clean sung choruses that range from being happy hardcore rubbish to overt pop/punk with harsh, pseudo-death shouts along for the ride. When combined with an assortment of industrial tinged keyboard elements, a somewhat appealing stew all but morphs into pig slop. What makes things worse is that the instrumental sections have been slightly cut back to make more room for lyrics and vocals, the two areas where this band has always been weak, but here also serving to make the stylistic embellishments that have corrupted the sound all the more blatant.\n\nIt might be an act of unintentional conformity, but I am forced to agree with the popular sentiments of the old guard metal community on this one, this is a pretty bad album. However, fixing an album like this would require little more than dropping one or two songs and changing the vocals around, which is pretty simple in comparison to many bands who simply sound bad no matter who is performing the parts. There is no actual bad songwriting to speak of, just poor arranging and a really bad stylistic mix put on top of what is otherwise a fairly consistent Gothenburg version of power/melodeath. Bargain bin hunters might be encouraged to part with a couple of bucks for 2 or 3 songs that are minimally affected by Frid\u00e9n\u2019s gimp hardcore singing, but the words of the day here is \u201clook elsewhere\u201d, and I am happy to have done my part to spread the word.\n",
        "\nModern metal is a term that I never really understood the meaning of, apart from being just a cute little name for new albums by bands who want to be contrarian in spite of inevitably sounding a lot like everyone else. When I hear bands define themselves using this term, the general outcome is either industrial sounding bands that don\u2019t want to be lumped in with Fear Factory and Ministry, or emo/hardcore sounding metal bands in a pathetic state of self-denial. When hearing \u201cCome Clarity\u201d from start to finish, both of these results manifest simultaneously, yet oddly enough the result isn\u2019t quite as offensive as it might appear.\n\nIn some respects, this album can be seen as schizophrenic in that it both embraces and denies what In Flames has gradually morphed itself into, a metalcore band with an odd fetish for industrial/gothic tinged keyboards. The riff work has somehow attempted to recapture the spirit of \u201cColony\u201d and has ratcheted itself up to something bordering on thrashing at many junctures, though loaded with pop oriented clich\u00e9 progressions and all the predictability of a clock pendulum. Consequently, more than half of these songs are all but completely interchangeable with each other and only the power ballad title song and the pointlessly dragging atmospheric closer \u201cYour Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone\u201d really stand out.\n\nNonetheless, there is a certain charm to this album that puts it in a different category from the rest of the lackluster melodic metalcore of this outfits latter day offerings. Frid\u00e9n has truly embraced his inner emo self, often channeling the whiny character of Gerard Way with a bountiful helping of Matt Heafy, and only occasionally regressing back into his hack rendition of early 90s death shouts. While perhaps slightly more grating that the usual banality of his contributions to the band\u2019s 1990s material, it is accompanied by a fairly frenetic and aggressive set of riffs and some solid drum work that makes it bearable. Perhaps the best comparison could be drawn to the post-Gus G era of Nightrage, or perhaps for a more time appropriate example, \u201cAre You Dead Yet?\u201d minus the flashy solos.\n\nWhile it is important to keep in mind that \u201cCome Clarity\u201d is pretty far down on my listening list, I could see this as being something worthy of a pickup from the lower price tier of the bargain bin. A quick listen to \u201cTake This Life\u201d, \u201cDead End\u201d and \u201cVersus Terminus\u201d will reveal a band that hasn\u2019t completely forgotten their past and can still shell out some memorable ideas and slay at full speed ahead, the dopey hardcore gang choruses notwithstanding. For some reason, in spite of myself, I also find myself going back to the sappy title song as well for some unknown guilty pleasure that goes with liking an obvious radio oriented exercise. Something about that acoustic intro just seems to get me, though unfortunately I can\u2019t say that this band has ever really been able to do that consistently for an entire album or even half of one of late.\n",
        "\nIt is pretty easy to get bogged down in pointing out where a band started to go downhill, and truth be told, the thought itself lends itself to a preconceived bias that may or may not actual do justice to a particular album. Nowhere is this more present than in the case of In Flames\u2019 middle era, where theories of when things began to either suck or sellout abound. But the principle target of a lot of the older fan base\u2019s indignation seems to be that of \u201cClayman\u201d, and like the ones thrown at its two predecessors, the condemnations are both equally accurate and inaccurate. In fact, apart from maybe a slightly larger amount of electronics being employed and a little less acoustic work, the only thing that separates this from \u201cWhoracle\u201d and \u201cColony\u201d is that it was released right before \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d.\n\nIn defense of this album\u2019s detractors, it is undeniable that Anders Frid\u00e9n\u2019s vocals have been getting progressively worse, but this album still bears very little resemblance to the emo nonsense that seeped into the band in 2002. The energy level and enticing mixture of elaborate riffs and consonant harmonies is all but exactly at the same level as \u201cColony\u201d, and the songwriting is equally as formulaic and geared towards easy consumption. The drum work on the part of Daniel Svensson cooks quite nicely and gives the whole album a similar power metal tendency in line with its predecessor. The only real point of contrast that is really of note in the overall character of this album is a somber character that permeates the production, which comes off as more solemn than the semi-chaotic commentary on religion that dominated their 1999 offering.\n\nBut putting aside the defensive statements with regards to In Flames\u2019 5th offering, \u201cClayman\u201d is a good collection of catchy, highly digestible songs that flirt with the melodic sweetness of middle era Nocturnal Rites, but with a heavier tone than even that of \u201cAfterlife\u201d. The better moments tend to be when the songs stick to cooking at mid-tempo or faster and not getting into quiet ballad sections where Frid\u00e9n\u2019s whispered and semi-clean vocals flirt heavily with Robb Flynn circa \u201cThe Burning Red\u201d territory, but even the quiet sections found in \u201cBullet Ride\u201d and \u201cSquare Nothing\u201d are loaded with enough hook driven guitar melodies to all but offset the revolting narrator. Be it the infectious and utterly brilliant afterburner of a cooker \u201cClayman\u201d, the slow grooving and depressingly heavy \u201cOnly For The Weak\u201d, or the Stratovarius-like anthem \u201cSuburban Me\u201d, the rule of the day with this album is good songwriting and it is consistently upheld with few exceptions.\n\nOpinions may vary, but ultimately this album is equally as worthy of the semi-orthodox tendencies of In Flames as anything else they\u2019ve done since \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d, and consistency would demand that this only be condemned for the same reasons as any of those other albums. From my perspective, this is another good example of the compatibility that developed between power metal and Gothenburg which was further explored by a number of Finnish bands, and also Skyfire. Apart from the lackluster vocal performance, which is still caught somewhere between a bad Chuck Schuldiner and a whinny nu-metal approach to screaming, there is very little to complain about, and much to be enjoyed.\n",
        "\nSince the conception of the Gothenburg scene, spearheaded by its own version of the Big 3 in At The Gates, Dark Tranquillity, and the infamous propagators of its most commercial aspects In Flames, the stubborn question of \u201cwhat does melodic death metal have to do with death metal?\u201d has haunted us all. This question could be best answered by an understanding of the death metal genre\u2019s evolutionary split between the newer, brutal style that had been informed heavily by grind-influenced acts such as Suffocation and Cryptopsy (and to an extent Cannibal Corpse, though they never fully incorporated the grind influences), and the conservative death/thrash crowd who became a minority but nonetheless endured in acts like Morbid Angel and Obituary. The thing is, like with all splits, there is never really an even halving of styles, and other parties tend to develop alongside the 2 more obvious results. While some could point to progressive tinkering amongst certain parties such as Cynic, Death was probably the chief instigator of what became melodeath, though they never fully integrated themselves into it.\n\nThis is all relevant because there is a good argument to be made that, in their infancy, all 3 of the Gothenburg trio had a noticeable death metal presence to their sound, albeit mixed in with consonant melodic material that hearkened back to an earlier time. But the assertion that melodeath was merely power metal with harsh vocal work and a bit more aggression didn\u2019t really hold up, that is, until the release of \u201cColony\u201d. The 4th studio offering by In Flames, the act of all parties in question that tended to be the most commercially oriented can be seen as one of the catalysts that along with several noted Finnish bands brought the power metal identity into the equation. The elements that made this possible can be traced back to the stripping away of the remnant of the asymmetrical songwriting style typically found in death metal compositions that took place on \u201cWhoracle\u201d, but there was one missing element that completed the circle, and that is newly recruited drummer Daniel Svensson. His driving, fast paced, intense drumming functions as a bridge bringing forth the speed metal tendencies of late 90s power metal, and thus the distinctions between 2 fairly different styles become blurred, and make the simultaneous upsurge of bands like Children Of Bodom and Skyfire all the more logical.\n\nIt should be noted that, unlike most Finnish melodeath or extreme power metal bands, In Flames hasn\u2019t adopted the same frenzied intensity. \u201cColony\u201d is more of a fast, but strictly structured assault that bares more musical similarity to the conservative Maiden worshipers in the power metal camp. The riff work is more prone to bouncing riffs rather than tremolo madness, the melodies are a bit more animated and, at times, percussive, and the drum work is as tight and precise as a machine. The guitar solo work has been spiced up to something that borderlines on virtuosic, in contrast to the reserved, semi-riff/melodic tendencies of past offerings. The only weak link in the chain, and one that really drags down the entire album, is the haggard voice of Anders Frid\u00e9n. While previously his vocals mostly came off as a really weak and cracking attempt at channeling Chuck Schuldiner, here his work sounds like a precursor to the metalcore-like whines of Alexi Laiho\u2019s later work on \u201cHate Crew Deathroll\u201d. It literally gets so bad at times that one might expect Matt Heafy to show up to supply some clean vocals.\n\nPutting aside the obvious flaws in the front man\u2019s performance, there is some pretty solid metal on here that could only be made better by putting Bruce Dickinson at the helm. Wickedly catchy bruisers such as \u201cEmbody The Invisible\u201d and \u201cScorn\u201d put forth a sound that could be passed off as a heavier, down tuned Helloween with a toneless voice at the helm. \u201cZombie Inc.\u201d takes the prize for best melodic guitar work, sweating the sweetness of consonant harmonies in a way that almost seems to want to revisit \u201cSeventh Son Of A Seventh Son\u201d era Maiden, but with a much deeper and harder edge to it. But in terms of driving intensity and overall triumph, the best songs are \u201cCoerced Coexistence\u201d and \u201cThe New World\u201d. Both feature wild guitar solo sections (the former features a guest slot by former Europe guitarist Kee Marcello, whose chops handedly surpass anything this band has done or will likely ever do on their own), but the real power is in the battering drum performance and the animated, almost thrash oriented riffing.\n\nOne thing is obvious upon hearing \u201cColony\u201d, whether one looks for this in an album or not, it is about as catchy and easily accessible as Gothenburg brand melodic death can get. This is the sort of album where literally anything on here, including the instrumental bonus track \u201cMan Made God\u201d, could be passed off as a single. Unlike its predecessor, it is not a concept album in a strict sense (though the theme of religion is present throughout), but it can be listened to from start to finish without any speed bumps that aren\u2019t automatically inherent in the band\u2019s sound. It could rightly be labeled as a brand of pop/metal in that it is wildly predictable, but it\u2019s also a solid bit of fun. Not the most spectacular thing to come out of Sweden, but definitely far from the worst thing to, and a possible crossover album to introduce power metal fans to more extreme styles, or vice versa.\n",
        "\nThere have been two camps with diametrically opposed views regarding In Flames\u2019 turn in style in 1997 with the release of \u201cWhoracle\u201d, accompanied by a somewhat smaller camp that insists that such a change did not occur. It\u2019s pretty difficult to fathom why the third camp even exists given that the divergence between said album and all preceding material is pretty massive, but perhaps it could be chalked up to loyalty to a band that kept metal relevant during the dark days of the mid 1990s. But the more challenging thing to do is to approach this album from a standpoint of objectivity, given the heightened expectations brought on by the preceding material, and also the notoriety that the band has enjoyed for the better part of 15 years.\n\nAll things considered, insofar as the style of the controversial 1997 follow up to \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d goes, the dominant sound is still mostly in the band\u2019s principle style. But simultaneously, it should be noted that the one-dimensional, short and formulaic, melody before aggression, mostly mid-tempo approach that is taken here has been plagiarized to no end by countless metalcore bands who claim melodeath tendencies. The whiny and lackluster character of Frid\u00e9n\u2019s vocal interpretation of late 80s old school death shouts, which sound haggard and hoarse than they do menacing, do nothing to help alleviate the inevitable comparisons to later bands hostile to metallic tradition such as Bullet For My Valentine and Atreyu. Pile on top of this an even larger amount of whispered narrations (which are not necessarily out of place on a concept album) and even a few poorly realized clean sung passages, and the missing link between this album and the spiritual descendant of nu-metal becomes quite apparent.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of the many glaring flaws that were not present previously, much of this album still holds a charm and appeal to anyone who was taken in by the previous studio incarnations. The melodic material retains that tuneful, semi-folk music character that was exploited by early to mid 80s NWOBHM bands, and is delivered in a somewhat more fuzz driven character. The track layering is very well accomplished, as the wandering higher guitar melodies stand out the most, yet don\u2019t fully detract from the heavier speed metal riffing and straight up yet pounding drum lines. The songs tend to blur together as the band doesn\u2019t really switch keys often and finds itself rehashing similar ideas at various points of different songs, but enough variety is established through acoustic passage usage and occasionally speeding things up to keep things moderately interesting.\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem at play here is the hit or miss tendency of the songs, as a concept album would usually lend itself to a full listen from start to finish. The marginally catchy and slow paced starting song \u201cJotun\u201d, apart from having an opening riff that sounds like it was borrowed from The Police and jacked up with distortion, tends to stand out with a good amount of variety stuffed into its near 4 minute duration. Likewise, \u201cGyroscope\u201d throws in a nice serene acoustic intro before punching in a familiar mix of melodic clich\u00e9s, and \u201cMorphing Into Primal\u201d kicks up the tempo a little to add a needed contrast to a very predictable riff set. But the real strengths of this album come about when the band either fully exploits their prowess at delivering moving acoustic sections such as found in \u201cJester Script Transfigured\u201d, or gets the vocals out of the picture to give the band\u2019s riff work room to breathe on \u201cDialogue With The Stars\u201d and the title song.\n\nThis is a really difficult album to have a really clear opinion on because it seems to go back and forth between being a serious effort and being a fluff fest for radio play. The album producer\u2019s testimony that the band seemed more inclined towards goofing off rather than recording the album isn\u2019t really a hard thing to picture when listening to this, which is somewhat irritating given that the album\u2019s concept of human self-destruction and overall lyrical content had some real potential. This is an album that has its fair share of filler, though there are some killer pieces hidden within it, and screams inconsistent like a slow dying murder victim. Seek this in the bargain bin, and avoid listening to the shitty cover of \u201cEverything Counts\u201d at all costs.\n",
        "\nSomewhere lodged in the midst of metal\u2019s alleged death in the mid 90s stood this, a member of Gothenburg\u2019s famed melodeath trinity, now fully formed and unleashed upon the unbelieving masses, or so the story goes according to In Flames\u2019 most avid of early fans. In truth, the first so-called true offering with vocalist Anders Frid\u00e9n at the helm is a fairly decent offering, though it carries the unfortunate status of having Frid\u00e9n on the album. Had the services of now swapped front man of Dark Tranquillity Mikael Stanne been retained, I can\u2019t help but speculate as to how much better this consistent collection of somber and melodic tunes might have turned out. Nonetheless, amongst the crop of early Gothenburg offerings, this is a decent release that can be enjoyed by anyone who seeks a middle ground between the consonant character of early NWOBHM and the viler tendencies of death metal.\n\nIn many respects, \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d represents one of the first true melodeath offerings, as it breaks ties with the chaotic song structures and rapid shifts in feel often associated with the style it grew out of. Instead of an utterly jarring collection of tuneful yet violent sections as typified in \u201cLunar Strain\u201d, the principle thrust at play here is melody and atmosphere. When following the various incarnations that Death went through in the early 90s, the death metal roots of In Flames and others in the Gothenburg become immediately apparent, though anyone who was raised on the more dissonant and morose bands drawn out of the Cannibal Corpse and Deicide camp will probably dismiss the scene as being power metal with harsh vocals (which is about as big of a stretch as comparing it with Cannibal Corpse), or try to label it a distant cousin of black metal (which is a little less tenuous).\n\nDealing with the divergence between this album and its 1993 predecessor is actually a pretty large affair, despite both being almost identical in overall quality. \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d comes across as much more focused and mellow, rather than being dry and detached; perhaps being best analogized as being a shift from being trapped in a block of ice versus being buried in snow. Instead of a bouncy set of folksy acoustic breaks and classical interludes, the quieter sections are much more droning and distant sounding, almost like the echoes of a massive cave. This can be best observed in the short instrumental \u201cThe Jester\u2019s Dance\u201d, which is a pretty good representation of why the band is often compared to Iron Maiden. The acoustic themes, in contrast to the bouncing ones before, have almost a crooning character to them, despite being layered on top of a driving bass and drum line.\n\nIn the midst of a very consistent album that balances out blasting tremolo sections with steady, down tempo grooves with layers of slow moving melodic lines is Anders, attempting to be the beast in agony in the midst of so much somber beauty. Suffice to say, he does an adequate job, but largely drags down the rest of the album. His sound could be best described as a somewhat whinny and weak rendition on the Chuck Schuldiner and John Tandy approach to old school death growls, being largely in a flat baritone character with a lot of strain and throat thrown into every syllable. It is still better than the ultra-whinny take on this style that most metalcore bands would bring to the table later, but it is pretty apparent that Anders is one of the sources of this well known and utterly annoying vocal style.\n\nNonetheless, in spite of a few glaring flaws, this is an album possessed of several early melodeath classics and largely avoids using filler to complement the killer. The band really starts off on a positive note with \u201cMoonshield\u201d, which takes an extremely beautiful folksy progression and obscures it into a droning acoustic line that eventually makes way for a massively memorable yet largely mid-paced song. \u201cGraveland\u201d and \u201cDecember Flower\u201d show the band able to kick up the aggression a little and yet still maintain that overriding character of wintry landscapes and hopeless endeavors, essentially merging this mellow sounding style with a solid bit of thrash elements. The only area where the album breaks character a little bit and almost turns into a happy sounding power metal album is a few minutes on the other instrumental \u201cWayfaerer\u201d, but against everything else, it is barely noticeable in spite of being painfully different from the rest of the album.\n\nThe sad truth is that in many cases, the person doing the vocals tends to be the person who makes the biggest impression, even on an album loaded up with instrumental breaks like this one. This is the sort of album that I can break out on occasion and really get into, but then have to shelf for a while both because of the somewhat annoying vocal performance, but also because of its utter simplicity. The biggest reason why this band and this style became so popular is because apart from the earliest incarnations of both, there is not much experimentation going on except for the basic concept of consonant melodies alongside a harsh vocalist. Basically speaking, if you want consistency then this is the album to get, but those who want an album with a few surprises will want to look to the debut. Speaking for myself, I like them both about equally, but for very different reasons.\n",
        "\nFew people can testify to the nature of the moon\u2019s surface from firsthand experience, and even those elite can only testify to what it looks like, as all other senses are constrained to a sealed suit with an artificial recreation of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Nevertheless, it is a good guess that \u201cLunar Strain\u201d, the first and somewhat unique offering of the then newly formed Gothenburg pioneer act In Flames, offers a few clues on this matter. Those who prognosticate at mysterious landscapes, inconsistencies in the surface based on random bombardments of meteoroids, and a dry air (metaphorically speaking) and aura are most likely on the right track with the literal nature of our planet\u2019s lone satellite, and definitely so in the case of this album.\n\nIn terms of most non-In Flames fans who otherwise like melodeath or at least might entertain liking some of it, this is a very safe album in that it lacks the 2 biggest liabilities that turn most off to even the older era of the band. For all of the hypnotic repetition and largely redundant ideas that tend to populate most of their albums, here these Swedes might be accused of overcompensating had this been released after \u201cWhoracle\u201d, but being that this is a debut, the more likely reasoning for the constant wandering from differing metal sub-genres at work here could be chalked up to the curiosity of a green band, coupled with the musical eclecticism that began pervading the coinciding black metal scene next door in Norway, which seems to have had a subtle influence on this album. Likewise, the more obvious plus on here is that the lackluster semi-barker Anders Frid\u00e9n is mercifully absent.\n\nBut for all the good things going on here, the album\u2019s strengths also become liabilities and keep what is largely a decent album from becoming outstanding. Although many often put out that the early Gothenburg bands tended to use riff sets and melodic ideas largely based on power metal, the overall songwriting style still tends to resemble the older death metal style. What this entails is a host of jarring changeups between not only riffs, but beats and tempos, resulting in a series of songs that seem to wander aimlessly from one section to the next, when in actuality are simply mimicking the general way that death metal compensates for limited melodic content with changes in overall rhythmic feel. Add to the mix a host of acoustic sections, some folksy, others neo-classical, and it becomes a little hard to follow everything that\u2019s going on.\n\nIt\u2019s almost astounding how many different ideas were compressed into a mere 36 minutes of music on here, and it begs the question of how much better this album would be if it had been organized a little more evenly. \u201cBehind Space\u201d underscores how all of these differing elements can be jammed into a sub-5 minute song, resulting in something that sounds epic yet seems way too short, to speak nothing for the violent shifts in feel from a series of blasting tremolo riffs and thrash ideas to a minute plus acoustic outro that has an almost proto-Suidakra feel to it. The album gets a little more consistent when the song lengths are shorter, but even \u201cDreamspace\u201d is frontloaded with a charming classical violin intro that abruptly shifts to a blustering metallic smash section with melodic riffs ablaze in a way that makes \u201cFight Fire With Fire\u201d seem measured and smooth by comparison. It\u2019s not quite all a semi-jumbled fit of madness, as the slow moving \u201cEverlost Pts. 1 & 2\u201d generally maintains a somber, slow feel, but the majority of the album seems just a little too ambitious for its own good.\n\nIf one wants to actually invest money in one of In Flames\u2019 earlier offerings, it\u2019s somewhat of a tossup between this one for having a fairly exciting if somewhat overdone construction with an extremely dry production, or \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d for a more consistent approach with an inferior vocalist. There was a point when this band was at least respectable, and clearly an early contributor to what became a massively popular sub-set of the death metal paradigm. It is probably one of the more unsafe yet safe albums out there for anyone looking for a gateway into music with harsh vocals, and will likely hold appeal to fans of more popular acts like Children Of Bodom, and also some of the Viking oriented bands that started cropping up soon after it.\n",
        "\nFrom the throat-grabbing riff at the beginning of \"Behind Space\" to the last few seconds of \"Clad in Shadows\", this album is very easily my favorite of the In Flames discography (second only to The Jester Race). The heavily-distorted guitar harmonies and Mikael Stanne's raspy screams and shrieks, when combined with the raw production, gives this album a very thrash metal-esque sound, almost venturing into black metal considering the various folk music intermissions.\n\nSo, what exactly is to be had with Lunar Strain? Everything you love about In Flames, but in an earlier version, with more raw production combined with a noticeably heavier instrumental section. Those who found post-1994 In Flames to be too \"poppy\" and/or \"melodic\" for their tastes might fall in love with this album, simply because it draws roots from more extreme styles in metal. Jesper Stromblad handles guitar, keyboard, and drum duties here, and (with Glenn Ljungstrom along side him) wrote most of the music on this album. Carl Naslund also provides guitar contributions, with Johann Larsson on bass. The one member that particularly made this album memorable to me was Mikael Stanne, of the so-beloved Dark Tranquillity. Being the brilliant lyricist he is, he wrote all of his own lyrics on this album, and made them sound damn good with this sharp, ear-piercing screams and shrieks that could be described as an amped-up alteration of David Vincent on Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness album.\n\nThe music itself, as stated above, is a thrashy, heavy, and melodic combination of Iron Maiden, Bathory, and even a bit Kreator in some sections. Being this is of course a Gothenburg melodeath band, the emphasis is obviously on the melodic aspect, but the \"thrashier\" sections are not uncommon (see \"Behind Space\", \"Starforsaken\", and especially \"Upon An Oaken Throne\" for extreme examples of this). This combined with the raw production make the overall sound much heavier and aggressive than later releases by In Flames. The entire album could be thought of as a thrash/heavy-metal version of the band known for such highly praised works as \"Pinball Map\" and \"Embody the Invisible\".\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this for any fan of A) melodic death metal, 2) In Flames, or D) old-school metal with harsh vocals. This corner stone for an entire genre should not be missed by anyone who can appreciate extreme metal.\n",
        "\nWhen I read other reviews of this album, I see a lot of passionate praise or dismissal of this release. Both of those seem very unreasonable to me simply because 'Come Clarity' isn't an album worth that much emotion either way. I understand that I come at In Flames from a diametrically opposed viewpoint to most on the band- I basically skipped them almost entirely while I explored metal because I never got substantially into melodeath- but I still think the level of passion expressed about an album as plain and straightforward as this is misplaced. It's not as though anyone out there genuinely believes that In Flames is going to start playing melodic death metal again, so why all the furor around the band making another mainstream, accessible metal album for 14 year olds at Ozzfest? Because that's what it is: not offensive, not a travesty, and likewise not a triumph, but simply the work of a band who are putting in their hours for a paycheck. I've heard much worse. Granted, I regularly hear much better.\n\nSo apparently In Flames was a melodic death metal band at one point according to historical records heavily debated by the metal scene, but these days (and on this album in particular) they're playing what amounts to pretty straightforward US-style melodeath/metalcore. Clearly the sound on this record is heavily influenced by Killswitch Engage with its harsh-sung verses and clean choruses as well as the general melodic style, but there's more of a legitimate extreme metal influence on this record than is found in most albums from the same genre in the form of (brief) blast beats and a more visceral, aggressive sense of riffing than one typically finds in the pop-metalcore scene. This isn't to say this goes very far to make 'Come Clarity' a unique and compelling release, but it does make it more listenable and helps separate it from the pack of a million other, similar albums released in '06. Frid\u00e9n seems like a capable vocalist, though his cleans come with a somewhat whiny, nu-metallish overtone that sounds like the holdover of a band that never really caught up with what was going on in popular metal. Were Ozzfest kids actually into this when it came out?\n\nI can admit that most of the riffs are pretty catchy in that Killswitch Engage way- unabashadly pop or alt rock chord structures hidden through scale runs or chugging pseudo-breakdowns. They're pretty fun to listen to, though they do start to grate on the ear when the band has run through so many ideas of this exact style that they have to get more and more convoluted to keep up with the lack of new, simple ideas. I mean, it's an infectious style- that's why it's popular, and while I do tend to enjoy the more intense melodeath moments on this release, the silly, rather charming choruses do have their place. Frankly, I'd rather listen to an album like this than one of the million stuck-up-its-own-ass releases from the 'heyday' of the Gothenburg scene ('The Gallery', I'm looking at your dumb ass)- yeah, it's artificial, silly, and not particularly artistic, but at least the songs are paced well and the band evidences some capability at standard rock songwriting.\n\nThis all being said, of course this isn't a particularly good album- I'm struggling to think of a melodeath/metalcore record I've heard that actually grips me in a substantial way apart from 'I like the neat diminished riffs and the chugs), but at this point I'm willing to accept the genre as pop music and nothing more. And therein, I think, lies the problem with how most people judge modern In Flames. As I said before, this band is never going to go back to the old Gothenburg style. Never. They've decided to play what amounts to pop music, so let's evaluate this based on the canonical features of pop music. Does it feature catchy melodies? Yeah, definitely. A brilliant lead vocal performance that harmonizes with the melodic instruments in compelling and memorable ways? Not really but I like it anyway. Is it paced quickly enough to not get boring to the jaded listener? Yeah, I suppose, though a couple tracks could probably be trimmed off the end of this release. Overall: basically a success at pop songwriting, though hardly anything to write home about.\n\nActually, the more I listen to this the more I like it just because it pisses some people off. That being said, I like Lady Gaga for the same reasons. In Flames isn't (and I would argue never was) a particularly artistic and brilliant band, but when it comes down to it I'm more likely to put this on than anything from their older career- it's more straightforward and I don't have to wade through a bunch of boring riffs to get to the good ones. Of course this isn't a great album, and of course it doesn't live up to the absurdly high standards some have set for this band, but who really cares in the end? Sometimes you just want candy, and this is pretty delicious in small doses.\n",
        "\nSo this was my first taste of the melodic death metal giants In Flames, although I\u2019m sure many hardcore fans of this band would say I should start elsewhere, it is what it is. I first listened to In Flames on last.FM when I heard Swim off of this album, and was transfixed. Unfortunately, this album was a tad difficult to procure, as i Tunes thought it would be a great idea to take all the old In Flames off and the leave the not-as-good newer stuff, such as A Sense of Purpose.\n\nIn Flames takes a very mainstream version of melodic death metal and brings in aspects of modern rock and speed metal, yet remain true to that original idea. Examples are clear with the extensive use of clean vocals on Only For the Weak and Satellites and Astronauts. The length of songs and also the way they are arranged and written along with the use of the occasional synthesizer tell you that this is main stream, but far from in your face about it, which is difficult to do.\n\nGuitar melodies on this album vary greatly from the infectious and brutal riff in Bullet Ride to crazy solos such as those on Swim. Songs also take slower tempos, and these carry the same weight as the speed demons featured here. Songs also transition and take on two distinct parts in certain cases, such as Pinball Map and the title track.\n\nThe vocals are simply what you expect from Anders Friden, and I personally like the clean vocals. They do attribute a lot to In Flames being main stream, but they are used appropriately and are not over used or under used. Lyrics offer interesting social commentary (Pinball Map) and also delve deeply into human emotion (Only For the Weak).\n\nIn Flames also flashes us a few moments of progressive writing. Square Nothing has some very interesting aspects that separates it from the rest of the album. Bullet Ride also gives us a breakdown leading to the climax of the song, which is absolutely beastly and knocks down everything effortlessly.\n\nThis album unfortunately features a lot of fluff that hides the gems of this album. There is just a lack of anything catchy or a really good head-banging riff on these songs. They are not terrible, they just pale in comparison to other parts of the album. These are: \u2026As the Future Repeats Today, Brush the Dust Away, Suburban Me, and Another Day in Quicksand. Also, the drumming as a whole is rather bland, but it does suit the music and is far from bad, but there are simply a number of opportunities where it could have been improved.\n\nBut what shocked me the most about this album is the song Only For the Weak. As you can tell from the title, I find this to be a remarkable song. In all honesty, it is my all time favorite song. That chugging riff is infectious and within 20 seconds of listening to it it is impossible to not head-bang. The clean vocals are used quickly and well and are phased out by screaming and guitar solo styled melodies with that lead into the chorus. The solo is nothing special but is just right. The songs fades out on the chorus with a short synthesizer bit. Wow. The guitars are great and this song contains in my opinion the most complex drumming on the album. However, what really sold me was the impeccable lyrics. They are entirely realistic (unusual for a metal band) and amazing in every way. Best moment in the song: when Friden is screaming at the top of the lungs \u201cThe tale of a bitter man, here I am\u201d and the music behind it also reaches a climax. Just all around amazing.\n\nAs a whole the album is all right, but I require that anybody who reads this at least somehow get Only For The Weak. In Flames gives you a decent listening session with the obvious gems and those songs that are just bland, not terrible. For mainstream listeners, this is a must buy, as it shows In Flames during their transition to more mainstream music. However, they remain true to themselves and that is certainly difficult to do under that sort of heading. If I did not already make it clear, buy Only For the Weak (other cool tracks are Swim, Bullet Ride, and Satellites and Astronauts).\n",
        "\nYes that's right people, the same band that today is releasing those terrible metalcore-influenced albums actually had a point in their career where they actually managed to release some pretty damn good albums. The Jester Race happened to be released in the peak of the Gothenburg metal scene in the early 90s, along with classics such as Dark Tranquillity's The Gallery and At the Gates' Slaughter of the Soul. This album was really the album that got me completely hooked with the early Gothenburg melodeath scene, and if you have a listen you will probably understand why.\n\nOne of the most outstanding elements of this album to me is the guitars. What really appealed to me with the guitar playing on this album was the amazing harmony sections that were created by Jesper Stromblad's and Glenn Ljungstrom's incredible lead-guitar work. These harmonised melodies were what really brought out and supported the vocal line laid down by Anders Friden. In fact, the guitar parts on this album stood out so much for me that I had all the lead guitar melodies stuck in my head after each listen instead of the vocals/lyrics, which is a really good thing! I also really enjoyed all the acoustic guitar passages that were included throughout the album, as it added a lot more character to the overall sound.\n\nEven though I wouldn't say the same about his vocals today, Anders Friden's vocals on this album were some of the best raw melodic death metal vocals I have ever heard. Although I have always preferred the likes of Mikael Stanne to him, he really does an amazing performance on this album, and his voice really blends in with the music quite well, which you definitely could not say the same for on the band's later and more horrible releases.\n\nI can't really say much about the bass parts (as most of the time I was blinded by the sheer might of the guitars), however it seems that it really plays its part in the album and does well to blend in with the other layers of sound. The same could be said about the drums, as Bjorn Gelotte really is consistent behind the drum kit on this album.\n\nThis album really is one of my favourite albums of all time, and the more I listen to it makes me just love it even more! I recommend that anyone wanting to give In Flames a little taste should not sit and suffer through their later stuff, but rather indulge in their earlier musical masterpieces, such as The Jester Race.\n\nMost standout songs for me: Moonshield, Lord Hypnos, The Jester Race, Dead God in Me\n",
        "\nSo, despite the last review I gave for an In Flames song (which got a 2/10, at the time the lowest score I had ever given a metal release here), I came back for more. Why? Maybe I enjoy causing myself pain. If that is indeed the case, I succeeded. \n\nIn Flames' newest release is a song called \"Delight and Angers\". Even if I hadn't known of this band's destroyed reputation, and even if I hadn't seen the song title, the first 10 seconds of the song told me that this was going to be a shout-out to the scene kids. You can just tell from the happy energy of the riffs that this band is never going back to what they used to be. I have still never heard any of this band's true melo-death works, but I get the feeling this song isn't what people think of when they imagine In Flames as one of the three pioneers of Gothenburg metal.\n\nAs for musical content, this is a boring scene kid chant. The guitars are even more simplistic than \"Take This Life\", the other In Flames song I reviewed, and they mostly use groove. Not in the cool way, though; nooo, we have to make all the riffs consist of scales that go UP, so the end result is that every measure of guitarwork makes you HAPPY! Oh goody! Even more amazingly stupid is the fact that they put distortion in the guitars a lot, as if the band was thinking \"we've lost most of the metal crowd, but these distorted guitar sustains will bring them all back!\" As for the drums, they're dumbed down even more than the guitars were. Back on \"Take This Life\", we at least had blast beats; here we find random cymbal crashes mixed with the occasional random, incoherent blast on the double bass. How fucking talented.\n\nThe vocalist is so terrible that I am actually going to devote an entire paragraph to him. Back on Take This Life, he attempted screaming in melo-death fashion. He failed. However, he was singing amongst this and I actually enjoyed it a bit. Here, everything is changed, for In Flames has become as mainstream as humanly possible for an ex-metal band. There are no screams, save one-second screeches that are almost too weak to hear. Perhaps you heard me describe Anders Frid\u00e9n as sounding like a stabbed baby in \"Take This Life\". Well, as a particular Calvin and Hobbes comic said, \"You should always save hyperbole until you really need it\". I couldn't agree more. Anders sounded like a virtuoso on the last song compared to his squeaky voice this time around. With his constant 12-year-oldish voice equipped, he literally - I mean *literally* - sounds like some guy's penis was in his butt the whole time he was recording this song. It's utterly fucking ridiculous.\n\nThis song is mostly mainstream in design. Intro, main riff, acoustic interlude, chorus, repeat all that, then bridge, chorus. If that isn't mainstream composition, I don't know what the fuck is. I actually wouldn't be surprised if this song was written by whoever the hell writes Lady Gaga's and Justin Bieber's songs, because it sounds about spot on with them. Just look at the lyrics to the chorus: \n\nPlease heal me, I can't sleep\nThought I was unbreakable,but this is killing me,\nCall me, everything,\nMake me feel unbreakable, lie and set me free\n\n...And I was thinking that \"Take This Life\" was the lowest of the low in lyrics. Turns out this band is versatile: they can turn ANY subject into food for the scene idiots! First it was thoughts of suicide, and now it's your typical middle-school crush! Aww, how sweet; I'm just having oodles of emotion reading this!\n\nI never thought it was possible, but In Flames got WORSE. Please, stay away from this by any means possible. Unless you're a masochist. In that case, have fun using this to get off.\n",
        "\nIn Flames were one of the first real metal bands that I began listening to around 2003; remember that Freddy Vs. Jason movie (yeah, enough said)?. The song \u201cTrigger\u201d was my introduction, and I thought In Flames were the gnarliest band on that movie\u2019s soundtrack. It\u2019d take a couple years later to further cement myself as a metal listener and delve into In Flames\u2019 older catalogue, eventually coming across this and firmly shitting my pants. Nowadays Subterranean isn\u2019t anything that blows my mind, aside from how the band went from this to A Sense Of Purpose. The skill is as good as it gets with these guys, as are the riffs, leads, and vocals, too. Just above twenty minutes of music is what\u2019s offered on the original release, though there are re-releases with extra tracks which you may like (I\u2019m not too fond of them). \n\nStanne turned tail to host Dark Tranquillity full-time and in his place we get the badass Henke Forss from Dawn. Now while his vocals in Dawn surpass the ones here, he still does a better job than Stanne and a better job than Anders\u2019 overall career in the band. Whereas Stanne had some raspy growls, Forss has forceful screams all cut-up inside like a true crypt-robbing ghoul. In some desperate sense they are kind of thin, since he bests himself in Dawn as a mutilated demon, but props for him upping the competition for In Flames vocalists past and present. Forss is encircled by some wickedly historic and malevolent atmosphere \u2013 a staple of old school melodic death metal. The most ominous of this is unleashed right away on \u201cStand Ablaze\u201d with its brooding keyboard intro straight from the protruding cracks of Hell (think Gorguts\u2019 \u201cCondemned To Obscurity,\u201d but less threatening). Not like the drums, though: loud, precise, intimidating, and rolling with tank-like weight. The two guests musicians on the kit were great choices and the tantalizing gallop style employed by both trumps the clapping duty from before. \n\nJesper and Glenn have more than doubled their efforts since the debut to actually supply some boiling riff charges and incredibly harmonic leads on the \u201880s side of Iron Maiden. Nothing frail or timid about them, and the instrumental mixing has been cleansed, helping the overall tone of antiquity instead of only the guitars like on the Lunar Strain. While I do miss the thrash edge the band had on some of their songs, they do bump up the overall appeal of heartfelt tunes like the title track or the acoustic crutch-song \u201cTimeless.\u201d The bass support, while loud and thunderous on occasion, is still the same follow-the-leader stuff that works and doesn\u2019t work at the same time. Not to say that it needs to always be autonomous and playing its own stuff, but backing the rhythm for thickening purposes wastes the instrument\u2019s potential, especially on music like this that has the capabilities to be excavated further.\n\nIn Flames may have played an important role in the influence of a lot of bands and a genre or two, but to me their music precedes their fame. This claim is limited to only a couple releases, though, as everything else they\u2019ve done has needlessly been mediocre or squandered for dreadlock maintenance. Subterranean is one of those lurker releases that takes little time to settle in and a lot of time to kick out. Think of it as the drug dealer that shows up at the party and still hangs around after the purchases, even though no one wants them around anymore\u2026 except Subterranean can stick around awhile longer since it comes with riffs.\n",
        "\nLong has it been since I first heard this and was floored by its magnificence. Back when I first heard In Flames, I thought they destroyed all the radio rock bands I listened to at the time. Reroute To Remain was then their biggest attraction, and Soundtrack To Your Escape was going to hit the market, too, but it\u2019d take me another year to take a dive into the archives of metal. The Jester Race looked the most attractive, so I took a gander and I was never the same again. After hearing this album, I knew damn well that metal was the music genre I\u2019d swear my life by\u2026 but not in any Manowar sort of way.\n\nI\u2019ve grown up a lot, endured tougher experiences, and encountered more metal that destroys In Flames. Still, this album has its appeal, but I don\u2019t consider it that grand masterpiece I once loved. To me, it\u2019s a great full-fledged Gothenburg album, and that\u2019s sad since it could have retained it's scene superiority. If it was between the lowest level of awesome and the highest level of great, then it's the highest level of great. The band dropped a good number of tracks, juiced it with the sweet tone of melodic death antiquity, and achieved a sense of identity \u2013 kind of like the Subterranean EP, but with more songs.\n\nBy this point, Jesper and Glenn were pulling heavy / power metal leads so wrought with slickness that the guitars, with a tone so cut-throat it could shred a warp hold if need be, take on that role. To a degree, this would make this a heavy / power metal album with screams / growls, and while I do agree with that, it\u2019s the core that counts. Songs like the enigmatic \u201cThe Jester\u2019s Dance,\u201d the majestic \u201cLord Hypnos\u201d (with that breathtaking bridge section), and the imposing solo-tsunamis of the title track and \u201cDecember Flower\u201d all support this case (that this is a power metal-leaning album), and the other thus far unmentioned tracks do the same to their respective degrees. Not only that, but none of them are sappy or half-assed like the ones found on Lunar Strain or on later albums like Whoracle; a lot of them don\u2019t slay, either, but a good lead will have to do. \n\nWith the guitar tone it\u2019s a certain sound that I will never forget \u2013 a very historic, ancient tone, especially with the leads and cleans. The keeper though is the burly, thicker, artillery-precise tone complimenting the rhythm riffs \u2013 much clearer and thunderous than previous In Flames releases. Backing up the guitar tone even more this time is the bass, doing the same rhythm backing as always and fluctuating between fairly clear and normally not. Between the depth of the guitar tone and the lower end of the drum kit, the bass does get firmly crushed. Nonetheless, thickness in this regard still forms a solid base, since the drums are taken on by Gelotte who, while not kickass, sure does a better job than Jesper. Gelotte, now on a grand kit with doorknob double bass and non-hollow snares, doesn\u2019t mess around with inoffensive, consistent beating. No, it\u2019s bashes and blasts for this guy, much like Svensson later in the band\u2019s career.\n\nThe frontman I\u2019m not a huge fan of \u2013 for the record, Anders Frid\u00e9n is a horrible vocalist, but here he\u2019s decent. Of course when I first heard this I thought he was a demon, but time and experience among far better vocalists has made Frid\u00e9n tame to my ears. His growling is like the growls you do after you get fired from your job \u2013 strong exhales with a bit of upper throat power that scrape the growl into a barked scream. It works much better than Stanne on Lunar Strain and I\u2019d take it second to Henke Forss\u2019 performance on the Subterranean EP; thin vocals couldn\u2019t have worked on this album, although I\u2019m not imagining hard enough to convince myself, either. Now the one problem I do have with these vocals is that they get fairly redundant \u2013 I hear them enough and they just become passive noise attached to the song, eventually tugging on it before dragging it down and making the whole album a bit boring. \n\nEven without his vocals, I do end up going for another album because, while entertaining, I\u2019m not gripped as emotionally by this music. Like I said before it\u2019s great, but not impactful anymore. \"Graveland\" flat out meanders on its own level unlike the rest of the album. Every song but that one rules. Even with the Black Ash Inheritance EP, which includes an extra cool track (\u201cGoliaths Disarm Their Davids\u201d), I\u2019m not thoroughly convinced that this is a gem from the older years. Putting it on In Flames terms, this is a classic, but zooming out once more lets me see that there are better fish out there in the sea\u2026\n",
        "\nTo my ears this album isn\u2019t a colossal failure, yet I\u2019m not convinced to walk toward the dividing line and onto the opposite spectrum, either. The band wrote some songs, put whatever resources and skills they had at the time together, and released Lunar Strain, a sort of crossbreed of genuine melodic death and a slightly earlier form of that Gothenburg sound that would be prevalent throughout the middle to later stages of the \u201890s. I guess the problem I have with it is that it\u2019s way too dull, and that\u2019s a fault constructed by the parts themselves rather than the sum. Basically, if you half-ass your way through the process, you\u2019re going to get a half-ass result.\n\nAt the core (and likely with the intention behind Lunar Strain) lies a heart of gold. It doesn\u2019t shine too well, but knowing its cause is true is a piece of the battle won. The In Flames which existed then is much different than the entity labeled In Flames today, but that\u2019s a given with experience, exposure, and time. This unit found on this album isn\u2019t the best line-up for the job, but they play the proper version of crippled melodic death. The atmosphere is despondent and sinister but not evoked in an intimidating manner, leaving a rather interpretive, dry dust to bask the listener. The production forming the base isn\u2019t remorselessly rigid, either, but more like dough pressed in by the weight of the sustaining energy. The band plays with whatever they can muster, but each budge forward becomes an exhausted grip, especially since most of the riffs are flimsy and dull. Very few riff attacks like those on the more Sodom / thrash-inspired \u201cStarforsaken,\u201d \u201cUpon An Oaken Throne,\u201d and \u201cClad In Shadows\u201d have that sanity-broken vigor to ram listeners.\n\nWith three guitarists partaking in lead and rhythm guitar roles, there isn\u2019t a lot to show for it in quantity. Yes, there exist Maiden-leaning harmonies and to some ears dual rhythms and a lead, but none of this erupts with pleasure. The guitars are aided by the brittle, rawer production (compared to the more creased albums later on) to gain a jagged, rusty tone that sounds badass on the thrash songs but thin and feeble on the melodic death ones. The riffs on these tracks are stable but neurotic to begin with, but the frail tone garnered by them turns the songs into limp tracks. Tossing in (rather loud) silly acoustics, string instruments, and amateur female vocals creates a bathtub of Gothenburg backwash and sloppy idealism. The only one going against this is Stanne as he retains his husky, caffeinated exhales; only ghouls and a whole 2-liter of 7 Up can produce these raspy growls-bordering-screams. Doesn\u2019t fit the best with the razor guitar tone, but I\u2019ll take whatever decent thing I can get at this point.\n\nLeave it to the bass guitar on here to sound nothing more than hiccups of booms like some drunkard following the rhythm. This isn\u2019t an uncommon move for a lot of bands, but it\u2019s another needless waste for an album that technically wasn\u2019t capable of anything else, anyway; audibility is one thing it has, but legitimate backing power is something it doesn\u2019t. Drumming does its job right with hopping double bass and lots of crashing openers after silences, but the consistent pacing is the keeper. Take the wispy snare and cymbals and just keep hitting them a so number of seconds in four innocuously different patterns randomly for the whole album and you\u2019ve pretty much nailed Str\u00f6mblad\u2019s execution; nothing stellar about them at all.\n\nHalf-and-half guitars, a numb bass, checklist-drumming, faux-romanticism, overall dire riffs, and uncomplicated songs create insincere music. Once more the core behind all these ideas is not the offender, but the players misguiding the message; this isn\u2019t nearly as horrible as the false interpretation of later In Flames, but it has created another waste album. Right after this the band would gather their beer cups for a couple of real offerings before steering in this zone once more before heading off into the realm of the erroneous. By In Flames\u2019 standards Lunar Strain is pretty good, but that\u2019s the border people need to do away with to see what\u2019s really in front of them.\n",
        "\nDespite some rather far-fetched claims that In Flames went Nu Metal right after \"Clayman\", the band's album \"Reroute to Remain\", the first album of the band's post-melodic death metal period, is generally accepted as the best of this era. Far above the shitty \"modern metal\" sound of \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\", above the half-assed pseudo-comeback sound of \"Come Clarity\", and above the band's most recent, and trendiest, almost emo work on \"A Sense of Purpose\", the band apparantly didn't suck so fucking much on this album. If this is indeed true, then I have been living my life totally wrong.\n\nThis album contains all of the most basic elements of \"melodic death metal\". For instance, fast paced drums, a heavy rhythm section placed neatly under melodic leads, etc. Some of these songs are still pretty moshable, although not even close to the energy packed headbang-fests that manifested \"Graveland\", \"Resin\", and \"Upon an Oaken Throne\". However, there is alot of excess on this album which simply cannot be dismissed. The addition of cleanly sung choruses, always sanwiched between uninspired sections of modern melodic metal featuring Anders Friden screaming his head off is simply offensive, and the lyrical change from astronomy and philosophy to self-pity and depression is just ridiculous, and offensive. I can't understand why a band would dumb themselves down this way...\n\nAnd here's my main problem with this album. It appears the band has \"sold out\", by replacing the intelligent and unique elements of their early albums by switching these elements with more modern and commercially acceptable ones. For instance, while older albums featured Anders performing at a variety of different tones and using deeper grunts and higher screams for emphasis (see: \"Resin\"), while sticking mostly to mid-ranged death growls, here he has erased any sort of variety in his vocals, focusing the entire album in a strained higher scream. However, these screams are totally annoying and don't inspire me at all. The clean singing, which was introduced on \"Colony\" (although used sparingly), has taken over the band's sound. Every single track features a cleanly sung chorus, many of which are very out of place. He actually sounds younger and far less manly than previously. Although it's cliche, these clean vocals range from KoRn inspired in some songs, to emo sounding in others. Yes, they are both present on the same album.\n\nAlmost all of these songs are genuinly bad, and a premonition of what was to come. Like \"System\", for instance. This track features an extremly simple \"chugga-chugga\" riff featuring two chords tagged at the end of the riff which give it a pseudo-melodic feel. Out of nowhere the band slow down into a power pop pre-chorus (no exagerration) before it blows up into a \"metal\" version of the same thing. This track is utterly terrible. Another example is \"Transparent\", which features a lazily thrown together opening nu metal riff, which is accompanied by souless blasting from the drums and screamed vocals. As usual, a cleanly sung chorus follows, this time featuring Anders using an effect on his voice to make it sound like he's singing into a walkie talkie. This is all followed by a lazily thrown together solo. See, the problem is that almost all of these songs start out with a cheesy, and extremly uninspired and unmemorable melodic death metal riff, usually featuring lots of chugging with only a couple notes tagged at the end giving off the melodic feel (as previously mentioned). While in the past the riffs and solos were the key ingredients to a song, here the riffs are just worthless throwaway riffs which all sound the same, with the choruses being the sole part which is memorable, and even those are generic and just scream FAIL.\n\nThe worst aspect of this album is definatly the \"experimental\" aspect, though. There are two acoustic tracks, \"Dawn of a New Day\" and \"Metaphor\", neither of which are very thought-provoking, although I suppose \"Metaphor\" provokes me to think \"Hey, this fucking sucks!\", so if that counts or not, I'll let you be the judge. Combined with this, the band have begun to add more \"industrial\" aspects to their sound, predominatly in \"Cloud Connected\" and \"Free Fall\". These two tracks show the band slowing down the overall pace of their songs to cater to the weak-minded masses, using more vocal effects, more keyboards, etc. Basically, the idea that the band that recorded \"Clad in Shadows\" would go on to record this, is just out of this world. There is absolutly no similarity in any way, shape, or form to the band's original sound. I honestly think \"Free Fall\" is the worst song on this disc.\n\nI just really hate thinking that In Flames abandoned their tried-and-true, classic melodeath roots, for this shit. Literally, every single aspect of this album is a failure. Do not buy, or even consider buying this or anything post-\"Clayman\". I can't say if the rumors are true or false, as I have never listened intently to the band's later material, but from what I've heard here, how could they get any worse?\n",
        "\nFor those within the one-time echelon of IN FLAMES/Gothenburg fandom, it all comes down to this...the penultimate FLAME-y album, one of the end-all-be-all melodic death metal albums, a masterpiece in every possible way. Sure, it all sounds pretty golden in that all-that-glitters catagory, and for my money consistent praise can only go so far until you feel the urge to partake in its wares for yourself, just to see if the positivity is justified.\n\nSorry, but it ain't.\n\nI'll start with the good, firstly...the performance on the album is pretty top notch, tight, and showing more than a fair share of competence. Given their style you need to be able to wrap both hands around your instruments and let it rip as best as possible to keep those tasty melodies alive, and the definitely do, if not with more tightened chops. The likes of \"Lunar Strain\" and \"Subterranean\u201d showed a lot of promise in the musicality, but the performance was quite immature and sloppy. This time around, the twin guitar leads, punchy rhythm work, and snarling vocals go hand-in-hand-in-hand with a definitive skill and technicality that shows a band really on its mark, where the melody takes top billing over the riffing and arrangements, shown by the likes of \u201cJotun\u201d, \u201cDialogue with the Stars\u201d and \u201cEpisode 666\u201d.\n\nBut unfortunately, it\u2019s not a perfect picture all around\u2026the overall feel of the album, including even the aforementioned good tracks, is a lackluster, boring, and increasingly unoriginal foray into middle-of-the-roadness that flitters by to become the most metallic of background music. Each song has the same tempo, the same melodies, and at times, the same damn riffs, over and over until the album\u2019s completion. Seriously\u2026if you skip half-way through the given song and listen to the next, you probably won\u2019t even know the difference. This is augmented most noticeably with the likes of \u201cFood for the Gods\u201d, \u201cThe Hive\u201d, and \u201cMorphing into Primal\u201d, each interchangeable by song title only. A good 80% of the album unnecessary filler, but it makes the whole album an unnecessary listen. Which I\u2019m sure the band wasn\u2019t shooting for.\n\nSo all in all this isn\u2019t anything special at all. IN FLAMES have always been very hit or miss, but this album is one of their biggest MISS moments. Ignore this and seek out \u201cColony\u201d.\n",
        "\nLo and behold, the only truly commercial In Flames album that is worthy of a little bit of praise, because after this, things really started to turn into crap. After releasing 'Whoracle', the strange album that is near-worthless but is still mysteriously regarded as a classic, In Flames probably found out that they needed a better formula to work on, so they came up with this.\n\nThe year is 1999, and around that period the Gothenburg bands slowly started to realize they weren't fooling anyone by playing something that bore the death metal name yet still had almost nothing to do with death metal, so they began to change. Some of them became more experimental, and some of them became more commercial. Being the most Maiden-bastardizing band this subgenre has ever seen, In Flames obviously took the second path, and so 'Colony' was born.\n\nThis album is the perfect definition of mid-era Gothenburg; It\u2019s Iron Maiden with downtuned guitars, screamed vocals, faster drumming and a streamlined approach towards songwriting, which is one of the main reasons this genre experiences such derision from many seasoned metalheads.\n\nI will begin by stating the obvious; this album is very catchy. Stromblad doesn't even care about pretending to be a death metal guitarist anymore, so he just goes 'Fuck it, let's play some Iron Maiden' and that's exactly what is shown here. Every track is filled to the brim with shimmering Maiden leads and melodic riffs, so I'm pretty sure you've got the whole idea by now; if you're looking for something extreme here, be ready to waste 40 minutes of your precious life.\n\nWhile many say that In Flames was already a sellout band from the very beginning, I say this is their only sellout album that actually worked. The whole mallcore bullshit that plagued Whoracle and would stain the rest of this band's forthcoming releases is pretty much absent here, being replaced by simple yet driving riffs and the already mentioned Maiden-inspired melodies, which while being painfully derivative, work very well within the album's context and musical direction, so that's a plus. Take 'Pallar Anders Visa', this album's instrumental track. It's simple yet beautiful, just like this band used to be; not overly daring nor extreme, just plain catchy fun. It works, it fits.\n\nWith Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s departure from drums to assist Jesper in the guitar department, his replacement, Daniel \u2018Leinad\u2019 Svensson, does a really nice job. His style is obviously more varied than Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s since he\u2019s actually a drummer and not a guitarist playing drums, and it works as well as when he played on Sacrilege. I might add that it would be really nice if he sung here instead of\u2026 oh, okay, let\u2019s get to the next paragraph, shall we ?\n\nAnd now comes my favorite part. Man, Anders Friden is still Anders Friden. His tone here seems a little bit more relaxed than the horrid one he used on Whoracle, but - of course - the man still sounds like a dying weasel. Also, this album marks his first attempts at true clean singing, and you know how it sounds, you just know. I'm going to be fair and say that it doesn't suck as much as it would later on, but it\u2019s still mediocre. Songs like 'Ordinary Story' would work much better if he just gave up the ridiculous moaning and started singing normally like he does briefly on \u2018Insipid 2000\u2019 , but hey, what can we do ? Let us be fair once again, this is the ONLY album where his penchant for multitracking actually works in his favor instead of against him, such as in the chorus for 'Resin', where his vocals actually sound (gasp) engaging.\n\nThe production job is excellent. The C-Tuned guitars sound \u2013 for the first time in this band\u2019s career \u2013 very powerful and well mixed, the drums sound heavy and clear, and the vocals are also well handled by the engineers. This album, and not Whoracle, should be considered a classic as it contains the catchiness of old In Flames mixed up with slightly modern but subtle sensibilities that don\u2019t detract from the listening experience. The very last interesting album of a band once full of potential.\n\nHighlights; \u201cZombie Inc\u201d, \u201cResin\u201d, \u201cInsipid 2000\u201d, \u201cPallar Anders Visa\u201d.\n",
        "\nThe In Flames of 1994 was a very different entity than what the band has become today, but it's interesting to listen back and realize just how much their core, melodic values have remained the same. In fact, now that Jesper Str\u00f6mblad has departed, there is not a single original member left in the band from those formative days before the band took off in a skyward direction with The Jester Race, perhaps the finest melodic death metal album I've ever heard. But the seeds for success were being sown as early as the debut Lunar Strain, and certain on this 5-track EP, its follow-up.\n\nYou won't be hearing Anders Frid\u00e9n's emotional snarling or any use of electronics and excess multi-tracking to modernize or debilitate the compositions here. This was strictly melodic death metal in the same vein as Dark Tranquillity, though In Flames had the early jump on that band in terms of production values. Subterranean sounded quite excellent for its day, from the bloodied vocals of Henke Forss (who generally dabbled in far more extreme bands like Dawn and Niden Div. 187). Str\u00f6mblad and Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m were as evenly matched here as they would be on The Jester Race, and the drums are split between Daniel Erlandsson (Arch Enemy, Eucharist, and others) and Anders Jivarp (Dark Tranquillity), with Johan Larsson on bass, who would go on to Hammerfall for a short time.\n\n\"Stand Ablaze\" is an excellent pick to open the EP, for the searing dual melodies are nearly the equal of anything on the following album, and there are plenty of them...as the band cycles from the melancholic intro of pianos and sampled conversational voices to a smorgasboard of showy riffing that pretty much sets the standard for the entire genre, surpassing the band's previous effort Lunar Strain. It's carnal, emotional and showing all the love for traditional metal guitars, like an Iron Maiden jacked up in proficiency. \"Ever Dying\" continues right where the first track leaves off, with a more downtrodden, somber aggression cast through a mid-paced storm of charging, rampant guitars, and a nice, shifting melodic thrash breakdown after 2:00 which is the apex of the entire song. \"Subterranean\" is absolutely glorious, in particular where the guitars erupt after 1:30 into a wall of stark, festive majesty. \"Timeless\" is a catchy acoustic instrumental which nearly rivals \"The Jester's Dance\" from the following album, and \"Biosphere\" closes the effort with a folksy surge and some precision riffing that borders on frenzied, technical thrash.\n\nIf you have somehow never versed yourself in this band's charms, or perhaps you're just hated the band due to some of their more modern efforts (Come Clarity, Reroute to Remain, etc), you should first direct yourself towards The Jester Race. But Subterranean would come directly after that, for it has much the same impact, with the one exception being the vocals. Some would argue that Forss was a better fit than Frid\u00e9n, and I can't debunk the theory entirely, though I really enjoyed the latter's work on a few of the band's albums before the turn of the century. Crucial material here for any fan of 90s melodic death metal, and as it is generally sold in a package with Lunar Strain, you get more bang for less lightening of the wallet.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAfter the relatively successful 1990's decade, the Gothenburg school (as in style, not a university) of melodic death metal began to hit a snag. Dark Tranquillity had experienced this with \"Projector\" and \"Haven,\" released a year before and the same year as \"Clayman\" respectively. Neither were terrible albums, but neither had that spark that made \"The Gallery\" or \"Mind's I\" so good to listen to. In the same way, In Flames \"Clayman\" hits a speed bump, but for different reasons.\n\nFirst off, when I hear this album, I hear In Flames trying to move into a new direction but perhaps a little unsure of where to go. On top of that, they also try to remain relatively planted in the same format that \"Whoracle\" and \"Colony\" had begun. This kind of playing it safe but also branching out usually doesn't result in a terrific album, and \"Clayman\" helps prove this point.\n\nThe bigger changes come in the form of Anders Frid\u00e9n's vocals and some experimental noodling going on. The former seems to have dropped his previous vocal style, instead embarking on a mid range scream that isn't very powerful. Frid\u00e9n has never been an amazing vocalist in my book, even bordering uninspired at times but here it seems too obvious. Even some clean vocal work heard on the title track begins to sound flat, which results in a downgrade from \"Colony,\" which had a halfway decent vocal performance going for it. The experimental edge also creeps in more prevalently here, with the most obvious being \"Only for the Weak,\" which seems like an arena attempt at melodic death metal. \n\nIn addition to the changes described above, the album itself just isn't that strong. It isn't terrible, not nearly to the extent of \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\" or the mind-numbing \"A Sense of Purpose.\" It does give the listener some memorable tracks, which includes the title track despite the somewhat uninspired vocals. \"Bullet Ride,\" \"Pinball Map,\" and \"Swim\" are all memorable songs, and unfortunately the only ones I could remember after not hearing this album a few days. Those songs which aren't as easily recalled aren't terrible, necessarily, they just lack the ability to grab the listener's attention and hold it even after the song has faded into the distance.\n\nFor what it is, \"Clayman\" is a mostly average release. Not much to talk about but also not much to complain about. It provides audiences with a few songs to take home and write about, but ultimately, finds itself pushed aside in favor of its three predecessors. Its still a worthy addition for the diehard fan of In Flames, just not something I'd recommend to the average fan. Newcomers to this band or fans of their later career now getting in their earlier material would be advised to seek out \"The Jester Race,\" \"Colony,\" or perhaps \"Whoracle,\" as those are the albums you'll find to be more worthy your time. \"Clayman\" isn't atrocious, but like the Gothenburg scene at the time, fails to establish itself as anything truly great.\n",
        "\nWith the recent departure of the last original member of In Flames Jesper, and the life blood of the machine that is my favorite melodic death metal band, I had to take the time to re-listen to all of Jesper\u2019s best works, and this one, every time I listen to it, stands ablaze above all the others. The talent that lies in these players never ceases to amaze me and every time I begin this album once more with Jesper\u2019s piano melody in the first half minute I have to let it play all the way through, I just can\u2019t seem to let this album go unfinished. \n\nThe thing that really gets me into this album is the incredible musicianship by these performers, not only strictly Jesper, but each person. The session drummers that In Flames had on this album both provide a unique and different taste to the drums in each track. Whether it\u2019s the steady and solid, but still very interesting and catchy beats of Anders Jivarp, or it\u2019s the incredible talent of Daniel Erlandsson wailing away on the double bass but still keeping a very interesting group of hits on the snare and cymbals going through the whole song. It was a very smart move and as I said before adds a lot of flavor to this EP. Next are the vocals. These are just incredible; they really compliment the almost melodic black metal feel of this album, and Henke really puts a lot into it to make them as good as he did on this album. His shrieks are menacing and his growls are deep and cutthroat, I really wished they kept him around for a few more albums, because I really enjoy the type of vocals that he brought. And here comes Johan, the bassist, and holy crap you can hear him! He really doesn\u2019t falter when he is playing and he does an excellent job on holding up the low end of this album and keeping it as heavy as ever. Plus he also keeps the main counter melody going when Jesper and Glenn are harmonizing on those amazing riffs together. Which leads me to my next point, I have always loved the guitar team of Jesper and Glenn, and they are able to compliment each other so well that every harmony sounds perfect and so well played and built up that it\u2019s sad that they are not playing together any more. The melodic riff in Stand Ablaze is a perfect example of this when they are harmonizing while tremolo picking and string skipping in some instances, they were just made to play together and this EP is the prime example of them at their best.\n\nThis album is a must have for any In Flames fan, for in my opinion, it their best album, each song flows into each other, from Stand Ablaze to the extremely catchy main melody of Biosphere, this album bleeds melodic death and black metal. It is a must have for any In Flames collection and if you can find the re-release that contains the demos of Dead Eternity and The Inborn Lifeless, it is even a better album and one that you will want to listen to over and over again. In fact, if you are a musician like me, you may even start playing these amazing bass lines or guitar riffs, and these will greatly influence and especially, will improve your playing and are just loads of fun to play, plain and simple\n",
        "\n\"Essential\" is a relative term that implies an album is a must listen for fans of the band mentioned and the genre that spawned it. In the world of melodic death metal, In Flames remains a constant mention, due to their pioneering stance in the genre and the fact they're the most popular. Yet while more recent In Flames have sunk into the depths of sub-par performance, there was a time when the music they put forth was a necessary listen for fans of melodic death. \"Colony\" is arguably the last of these albums, joining \"The Jester Race\" and \"Whoracle\" before it.\n\nIn terms of progress, \"Colony\" is the next step from \"Whoracle.\" The songs seem better crafted this time around, not to mention catchier. The melodies still stick in your head for quite some time afterward and some of these songs still contain a fair share of kick to them. In terms of Gothenburg inspired melodic death metal, I have to agree with a number of reviewers here in saying this is about as good as it gets from this genre. I may have before that \"Whoracle\" was my favorite, but after re-listening to this album for a while, I must say my opinions have changed.\n\nWe get to the core of what is great about this album in songs like \"Embody the Invisible.\" Its pure melody and catchiness, one that will be swimming in your head for days. Add \"Scorn\" to that list, a song I particularly liked on this album. \"Scorn\" also keeps the pace picked up rather well during its duration, only slowing down in certain spots. The title track is a slower, more ambient number that employs some mood shifts but good nonetheless. \"Zombie Inc.\" goes through some tempo changes as well, but this song manifests them into something better and more exciting than the title track. Other great tracks include: \"Coerced Coexistence\" and the returning concept of dual instrumentals in \"Pallar Andres Visa\" and \"Man Made God.\" The former of those is the better, and arguably one of the best instrumentals by the band.\n\nUnfortunately for In Flames, this seems like a dead end for them. Maybe \"dead end\" isn't a great term, more like \"Colony\" was such a good release they couldn't possibly improve upon it. I felt like \"Clayman\" gave it a whirl, but in the end fell flat with only a handful of songs being keepers. \"Colony\" stands as In Flames' triumphant moment, packed with more aggression and more catchy melodies than the two albums prior. Its a great listen through and through, and causes one to ponder what in the hell In Flames were thinking when they left this behind. Again, possibly has to do with the inability to recreate successfully what was present here.\n\nIn the end, I look kindly upon \"Colony.\" I said it before, and its been said by several others, that this is In Flames' best effort. It towers above everything \"Reroute to Remain\" and is also comes out over its two counterparts in \"Whoracle\" and \"The Jester Race\" in the popular In Flames trinity of albums. As far as Gothenburg is concerned, I believe its a worthy mention in the best that scene has spawned, alongside Dark Tranquility's \"Mind's I\" and \"Projector\" and possibly some of Soilwork's earlier albums, like \"A Predator's Portrait.\" As for the curious of In Flames, \"Colony\" is an excellent first album, as it presents their pinnacle before their slow collapse on \"Clayman\" and beyond. For the misguided diehards of new era In Flames, \"Colony\" is also a must as it portrays the greatness this band once possessed. In any event, any fan of In Flames and/or melodic death metal will be wise to seek it out.\n",
        "\nAfter the highly commendable \"The Jester Race,\" In Flames began to craft a new artistic niche for themselves. One of the more visual changes was the transformation into the new logo, which is more straight-forward than the old version but logos aren't everything. In addition to this, In Flames began to craft their sound more to a wider appeal, which continued exponentially with every release on up until the modern day. This new change in sound isn't necessarily bad, nor is it ever inherently bad so long as the artist in question makes it pleasing to listen to. By most means, \"Whoracle\" is a great sounding album, as it takes on new directions while also making a logical step forward from the previous album.\n\nThe production issues present on \"The Jester Race\" have been taken care of, the drums are more present in the mix, giving the album a driving edge. The drum work itself still isn't very impressive, but it fulfills the job at hand. The leads and guitar work are very catchy, making the good share of these songs highly memorable but they don't rely solely on infectious melodies to capture one's attention. Most everything here is finely tuned Swedish melodic death metal, and \"Whoracle\" is definitely one of the best albums In Flames has ever gotten around to putting out.\n\nThere are a cache of good things to enjoy here, from the sheer catchiness of the majestic works on \"Jotun\" and \"Gyroscope,\" to the incredible solo present on \"The Hive.\" Of course there is also \"Episode 666\" which remains an In Flames concert staple and a fan favorite. Yet these alone aren't all that bear mentioning. \"Dialogue with the Stars\" is a nice little instrumental, that reminds a little of \"Wayfarer\" from \"The Jester Race.\" There isn't as much classic guitar work here as before, seen on songs like \"Moonshield\" but they do occur, particularly within \"Gyrocscope.\" There is also the speedy \"Morphing Into Primal,\" which seems to be overlooked sometimes, despite being a highlight in my book.\n\nWhile most of this album listens very well, I found some songs to be something of a downer. \"Jester Script Transfigured,\" despite working well in its seemingly experimental territory, is an odd choice on this particular album. \"Whoracle\" isn't exactly firmly grounded in a singular mode throughout its duration, but that song took me by surprise. \"Worlds Within the Margin\" starts off pretty well but its a bit too slow and begins to grow tedious as it nears the five minute mark. While both of these are not necessarily bad and both are listenable, the Depeche Mode cover in \"Everything Counts\" is a serious mis-step in covers. I don't know why it was included or how it relates to the topics at hand (which I understand revolve around a utopian society destroyed by human nature) but it seems really out of place and could have been left out. Aside from this one song, none of these are throwaways and all listen well to some degree.\n\nWhile there will forever be the contest of \"the\" In Flames album, divided up between \"The Jester Race,\" \"Whoracle,\" \"Colony,\" and a small minority who advocate \"Clayman,\" my vote goes with this one. Its a close tie with \"Colony\" and slightly over \"The Jester Race\" but all three of these are necessary listens for fans of ear-friendly melodic death metal. Of them, however, \"Whoracle\" stands out as the uniformly best of them. The music here isn't awe-inspiringly technical nor progressive, its mostly traditionally inspired songwriting meant to please the ears with some gracious melodies and lead work. Despite its singular misfire in the Depeche Mode cover, and fairly mundane drumming that's going on, \"Whoracle\" is a respectable album and absolutely necessary for In Flames fans. Anyone who praises newer In Flames but has not heard the old, is in desperate need of experiencing just how good this band really was at one time.\n",
        "\nIn Flames may be nothing more than MTV2 fodder to most, considering the ridiculous nu-metal ramblings of \u201cCome Clarity\u201d and \u201cA Sense of Purpose\u201d. But there was a time when they were true melodic metalgods.\n\nUnfortunately, In Flames\u2019s pitiful ascent to stardom has followed the same whoring path as Cradle of Filth and Dark Tranquility, shying away from its roots, and metal altogether, to become a glossy-video, mass-market supergroup. However, they were a truly talented band that produced amazing albums before their downfall, just like the aforementioned British Filth. \u201cColony\u201d is one such album. \u201cColony\u201d is a masterpiece.\n\nThe feat of having a lengthy 13-track album that still ends way too soon is incredible in itself already. Every song is a highlight, not even the instrumental feels like a filler. It\u2019s rare to find an album where every track is different and yet it still feels like a universal idea as a whole, a single-minded entity. Even the order of the songs seems planned and pre-meditated, here every single aspect of the album contributes to the feeling it invokes.\n\nThe production of this album is absolutely perfect! It feels enormous in the sense of depth and clarity, with very subtle echoes and other effects. One cannot think of In Flames without the incredible guitarists coming to mind. Stromblad and Gelotte weren\u2019t included on Guitarist magazine\u2019s \u201cGreatest Guitar Duo\u2019s\u201d list by accident. The guitars on \u201cColony\u201d are monumental! The composition is impressive on every song. Every riff and solo is an experience, bearing a sense of purpose and occasion. The harmonising twin-guitars are stirring, each note ringing true. They switch seamlessly between heavy riffs and beautifully melodic interludes, successfully channelling old-school masters into their modern European sound. The bass is very solid, the 6-string never running out of answers and proving innovative even amidst the immense wall of guitars. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to name the style or genre of the music on this album. At times, one is tempted to say metalcore, and yet that isn\u2019t correct at all. As vague as it sounds, \u201cColony\u201d is the epitome of melodic metal, with the guitars and bass often adopting an \u201880\u2019s style reminiscent of Iron Maiden or Saxon. Another brilliant success of this production is the drums. The sound is exactly right, perfectly suited to the overall sound of the music. Even in parts where the music lends itself to more aggression and the drums step up accordingly, the double-bass is never deafening. The cymbals are crisp, the snare tight and full. Many times, the drums also lean in favour of older metal, with slower beats and minimal speed or aggression, but it suits the melodies and pace of the songs. It is picked up occasionally to a double-time or double-bass drive, but never seems like too much, never heavier than the album wants it to be.\n\nBass is not often so substantial in an album of this kind. Almost always audible, and harmonising beautifully with the guitars, it brings a third leading sound rather than simply rhythmically backing up the guitars and filling the drums. I\u2019m not a huge bass enthusiast, but here the bass impressed me, never standing back to let the incredible guitars steal the show. The vocals were perfected on this album. It was too deep on \u201cJester Race\u201d, almost death metal, making it too much and too indistinct for the melodic sound of the music. Furthermore, it was to refined on \u201cReroute to Remain\u201d and later albums, with over-the-top clean vocals and not enough metal. On \u201cColony\u201d Anders got it just right. A very recognisable scream with the odd grunt and even cleaner sections, it had decent versatility. A very passionate and spirited delivery helps to emphasize this, proving that the vocals, like everything else on this album, were not just an afterthought. His voice suits the music perfectly, with enough infectious scream-along choruses making the songs truly memorable.\n\nInevitably, the guitars claim most of the glory on \u201cColony\u201d, but unlike Dragonforce, the rest of the band has more than enough to do the melodies justice, making this album a clear triumph. This is undoubtedly the highlight of In Flames\u2019s career. Where today, their name must always be whispered in public, lest a mallcore fanboy comes running about the brilliance of their latest albums, they sadly seem reserved for commercial mediocrity. However, \u201cColony\u201d, unknown though it may be, is a shining testament of their former glory. A pivotal moment in my metal life, it must be added to your collection at all costs.\n",
        "\nThis is almost too easy to review. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. It's almost like punching out a 5 year old. Entertaining? Yes. But it's not something you want to make a career out of. \n\nIt's been about 5 and a half years since this single was released on a not so eager metal crowd. Over the course of those 5 and a half years this single has not been looked upon kindly. Here we see In Flames completely go for broke in trying to obtain pop music success. Did they reach the level of mainstream acceptance they wanted? Not really. They are no more famous today than they were when they released \"Reroute To Remain\" and they're definitely no better. They are in a pop metal purgatory these days and I wouldn't be too surprised that's where they wanted to be in defense of them wanting to progress and sound different. There is nothing wrong with sounding different, it's great, but if that means sounding different from the very music that made you popular in the first place, well then that's just plain ol' selling-out without even admitting the truth. At least Raven and Celtic frost said they wanted to be more mainstream when they turned in their cold turkeys, but this single is a bad case of simply being in stubborn denial. Another reason why I decided to review this single instead of the entire \"Soundtrack To your Escape\" is simply due to the fact that it's a bad album, and I don't ever want to listen to it again. Period. \"The Quiet Place\" pretty much singled up everything that was wrong with that album. Only here on the single you don't have to listen to 12 songs of lameness. You only have to suffer about a quarter of the album's length and that is enough to make anyone suffer to being on the verge of a mental breakdown.\n\n\"The Quiet Place\" single is offered in two different version of crap with a total of 6 songs, a music video of the single, and a studio recording session. Also said with multiple versions that don't even make goddamn sense. It even offers the unfortunate listener artwork that doesn't even fucking fit the theme of the song. It looks like a man in a rolling ball headed in a unknown direction. HELLO?! \"PINBALL MAP\" RING A BELL??? Obviously the completely forgot which song they were making artwork for. I mean I would have settled for something like a padded cell, hence the name \"The Quiet Place\". At least it would have fit the concept. Sound production is squeaky clean that Metallica would cream over. \n\nThe first song is \"The Quiet Place\" where it is a more melodic \"Jump the Fuck Up\". The worst part of this song is Anders. Dude, just admit you want to sing for Korn so badly. Stop pissing all-over the good stuff you actually did with In Flames with your fucking \"I'm feeling negative emotions and laying in a darkened room dealing with inner turmoil but at least I am expressing my angst!!!\" bullshit. Oh Christ. The band has simply forgotten everything they have learned as far as making any music that is related to metal. Next song is a remix and...y know what, I'm going to stop here and just say don't fucking listen to it. Listen to Annihilator's \"Remains\". Listen to Raven's \"The Pack Is Back\". Hell, listen to \"St. Anger\", \"Cold Lake\", \"Roots\", \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d, and \"The Unspoken King\" back-to-back. At least those album HAD metal riffs. The remix of \"My Sweet Shadow\" is undoubtedly the WORST music In Flames has ever attempted to record. It is a techno remix of Anders' whiny voice over crappy beats that could be easily found on an Apple Macintosh. You can barely even hear the lyrics, he's spewing so much snot-covered drivel. It's not until 1:02 the we hear a guitar riff which then turns into a lame rave song. \"V\u00e4rmlandsvisan\" is a live acoustic piece that is the only redeeming factor about this single. Next is the video for \"The Quiet Place\" where we get a visual of Anders not only whining but acting like a fucking retard. Somewhere during a movie showing a theater he falls asleep and is transported into the quiet place' where I guess it's his over-infatuated ego telling everyone that he's struggling to come out of the closet. There's an image of the rest of the band in a psychiatric ward completely doped-up and I actually believe this band was doped-up for the most part of making a song as lame as this. Last but not least is live studio recording sessions where the band is sitting around drinking beer and being too relaxed. You can look in their eyes and tell that they just really don't give a fuck anymore. \"Hey, let's put this shit out and everyone will eat it up because we're In Flames. We're melodic and we were the band that made Gothenburg metal so damn famous so they'll have to like anything we put out!\" Not me buds. Not this metal head. \n\nAgain, it's a miracle to see how In Flames survived this bad car accident. I still believe they want to do more music in this vein but they're only teasing what little fan base they have left until they secretly release their next fucking monstrosity.\n",
        "\nI've never been the biggest fan of In Flames. Forgive me for not fellating them for the most part of the late 90's when they were supposed to be the daughters of the metal community when just because they are Swedish means all attention should be focused towards them. I think there should be certian laws place in the said metal community that if one doesn't pay much attention to a certian band that is doing the right thing, don't ostricize him whenever he speaks his mind. God forbid a metal head should speak his mind under any reason other than fellatting a band in sheep-like manner.\n\nWith that said, when In Flames' \"Reroute To Remain\" came out I knew what to expect. I KNEW what the band sounded like before and I knew what to expect when I first purchased because I was reading a lot of mostly scathing, but a good percentage of decent reviews based on the album's change of pace. So I kept an open mind completely un-biased towards them and sat down to listen to it pretty thoroughly. Surprised to say I didn't find too much wrong with the album because I knew what In Flames was trying to do; take their Gothenburg sound and try to find a place snug-like next to Disturbed in an attempt to gain new fans. \n\nLet's get to the musicians. Guitarists Jesper Str\u00f6mblad and Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte may not be \"teH bEstEst eva!\" but that's not to say they know what they are doing. They are completely highly-skilled guitarist who can easily perform riffs up there with the classics such as \"...And Justice For All\", \"Bomber\", or even \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\", but albums that this certian LP cannot touch for the sole fact that a lot of songs where Jesper and Bjorn trying so hard to SOUND hard when they end up repeating a lot of un-necessary riffs that in turn only rise to the level of filler songs. Even the drummer and bassist(Daniel Svensson and Peter Iwers) whom I don't pay much attention to are providing the heavy bottom end to their well-constructed Swedish melodies when Jesper and Bjorn are completely on. It's just the lead singer Anders Frid\u00e9n that brings the band down from FULLY realizing their potential. Even with his best performance on \"The Jester Race\", he lacked the gruffness and conviction to REALLY push that album over the edge. Here on \"Reroute To Remains\", it is apparent that he's taken a certian likeness to Korn due to his whiny fucking vocals. I mean there are parts where he stills sounds ok, but then other parts where I just want to smack him in the back of the head and ask him was he born without testosterone. But this is all due to the fact that it's more acceptable for front men of Metal bands to show more of their feminine side these days then say 15 years ago. Also there are some guest musicians on \"Reroute To Remain\" such as \u00d6rjan \u00d6rnkloo providing keyboards and synths that definitely give it it's catchy pop sensibilities and the amazing Fiol-Olof whom I'll discuss more later on. \n\nSound production and artwork is going to be obvious with In Flames. Squeaky clean sound and hi-glossy printed artwork. I mean they're not going to put out any album that has a balls-ripping raw sound like Morbid Saint or even something dirty and grimy like early 90's Ministry because they are European and they are soooo beyond that \"basement sound\". Whatever, fuck them. Keep on progressing with your Pop Rock productions and see where it gets you.\n\nI wont go into a song-by-song review for many reasons. Mainly because with In Flames you know what to expect. The songs presented are half and half. Half are them are really good and very catchy while the other half ride between filler and just annoying. Here's the evidence;\n\nGood: Title track, \"Trigger\", \"Cloud Connected\", \"Metaphor\", \"Free Fall\", \"Dark Signs\" and \"Black And White\" where we see what I refer to them as Disturbed going Swedish. In fact this is probably the best song Disturbed didn't write. It's still a good song nonetheless. This batch of songs shows In Flames do everything correctly when it comes to direction, groove, how well everything flows. General good songs. 5 to 10 points a piece.\n\nBad: \"Dismiss The Cynics\", \"Transparent\", \"Dawn of A New Day\", \"Minus\", and \"Egonomic\". Now that last song I mentioned is because it's one of those fast songs for the sake of being fucking fast and In Flames has to at least always put one or two fast songs on every album since they turned for the worst due to the fact that they still want be perceived as Gothernburg metal. Other reasons for a song might be put here is that the song doesn't know what the fuck it wants to be and this is mainly due to Anders wanting to try to sound serious and yet sounding whiny as fuck at the same time. Also we see more Korn/Disturbed riffs pop-up in places where they don't need to be. Regardless of them being bad I'll still the songs a point each for trying.\n\nUgly: \"System\". Fuck this shit. Anders is a whiny little bitch at times, but here I can imagine him standing in a Morrissey-like posture, staring at the ground all doe-eyed, cradling the microphone with his limp wrists trying to sound all \"deep\" and \"emotional\". Then we see In Flames going COUNTRY! Starts out with a nice little folk-like acoustic and then comes Anders' whiny fucking vocals again and....what the fuck.....country-inspired violins. Now after a few listens it doesn't sound completely annoying, where it goes more into a completely listenable break from 1:50 to 2:32 but it doesn't belong on a Metal album. Fiol-Olof is talented. She can go from folk-ish melodies to country twang to a more classical sound at the drop of a hat. But it doesn\u2019t sit well on the album. Sorry. I live in the south and it's bad enough. No points. Sorry.\n\nWell, bottom line is that I am in a generous mood considering that I pained myself to sit through the new Five Finger Dick Plower album so when comparing the two albums, this one sounds NOTHING like that in terms of sheer shittiness. It\u2019s not that bad of an album folks. C minus grade.\n",
        "\nI'll admit I had very little expectations towards this new album, and even less after seeing the Korn-like cover art. It didn't help that pretty much everyone I know hated it from the start.\n\nBut here's the thing...I like it. I really, really like it. It started with me liking only the first 5-6 tracks, but now I like pretty much the whole damn ordeal. Here I go again, losing all credibility, right? Wrong. It's the best In Flames album of the 21st century and my favorite since at least Clayman. The reason is because they've taken a lot of these tangents they've been on for the past half a decade: the vocal experimentation, electronic elements, and groovier guitar riffing (dare I say nu-metal?); and they've welded them successfully into their earlier, inspirational melodic death hooks to produce a powerful expression. Anders vocals have TRULY come together on this one, I have to admit.\n\nIn Flames is the soundtrack of futility and frustration but achieved through uplifting, energetic melodic riffing, slamming grooves and impassioned cries. They have found their Sense of Purpose, and delivered, and it's about damn time. \"The Mirror's Truth\" presents a salvo of super emotional melodies and layered chorus parts with great guitar work, but not afraid to break it down with some insanely awesome melodeath grooving. \"Disconnected\" weaves its course around one of the best thrash metal riffs I've heard this year. \"Sleepless Again\" features the return of the great acoustic guitars we haven't really heard since their early work, even if only for a small part of the song. Ditto with \"Alias\", except the acoustics are a mid section surrounded by an excellent, mid-paced melodic, passionate track with an unforgettable chorus smothered in some great, anthemic riffs. \"I'm the Highway\" is pure fucking In Flames, melodic death metal at its finest, with adorable little guitar lines. \"Delight and Angers\" begins with an excellent pit groove, yet entirely thrash. This isn't even half the fucking album yet, but you get the point!\n\nIt may be nearly impossible to convince the multitude who have had a hate on for In Flames for well near a decade that anything they do is worthwhile, but if that doesn't include you, for the love of the firmament check this album out, get lost in its squalor, its frustration, and its beauty, because it is an excellent record and....FINALLY! If it took a few years of mediocre efforts like Come Clarity and Soundtrack to Your Escape to arrive here, then I welcome it. And I will welcome more, as long as it's this good.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMy eeeeeeaaaaaaarrrrrrssssss!\n\nC4 was bad enough, but Anders takes the cake for killing your ability to hear higher frequencies. God damn what the hell happened? He could barely sing on Colony, but this is just disgusting. I know screams are good in music, particularly black metal, but these screams make poppy screamo bands sound talented. It\u2019s so annoying hearing him talk, scream, whine, and clean sing on this release that\u2026 really\u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter how impressive the leadwork can be. They just sound so queasy, swine-like, annoying, and childish, but it combines well with the more childlike music so I guess the joke\u2019s on me.\n\nLead wise it gets more inoffensive, with In Flames trying to branch out to teenagers this time. Leads aren\u2019t as remarkable anymore, but they\u2019re still overblown like on Colony, filling every gap and leaving no riff unpussified. Verse-chorus-verse-chorus predictability has become an In Flames trait now, and it really becomes redundant by the fourth song. Instead of being neutral, I just have no more reaction to anything this late in their career. It sounds so\u2026 artificial and mock - completely ditching all decorum that characterized Subterranean, The Jester Race, and even Whoracle. Good heavy metal leads start to dwindle, power metal rhythms begin to crumble, and bass pretty much isn\u2019t a part of the band anymore (its just there so fans won\u2019t ask why there isn\u2019t any). All right whatever the bass is there, but it completely follows the rhythm guitar note-for-note and with much less volume \u2013 if I was the bassist, I\u2019d be pissed. The only song that contradicts most of the criticism is \u201cSwim\u201d since it\u2019s a short song with a raunchy solo bridge and extremely heavy Maiden worship.\n\nThe rest of it I\u2019d call modern heavy metal with harsh vocals, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s that good. Where Colony was overly melodic and mediocre, Clayman is overly dull and despondent; a lot of energy with no life coming out of it. Svensson can\u2019t even save the band with his hectic playing backed by super production standards. He can bash, crash, hit, and smite all he wants to, but everyone hearing this will take notice of the leads first \u2013 it\u2019s a flytrap.\n\nFor a while I considered this the last good In Flames album and considering In Flames\u2019 standards that\u2019s kind of true, but really this is pretty uninspired. It\u2019s worse than the previous two because it completely ditches the wonderful tone of antiquity and fantasy, opting for a more modern approach that kills all credibility. Svensson, get your fucking ass out of this band. I hope he only lived through recording the more appalling albums just so he can make some money to fund Sacrilege.\n",
        "\nLiterally, Daniel is the only member in this band today that still outshines everyone else, though I wouldn\u2019t count it all on his drumming for later releases. Here he\u2019s spectacular, putting the guitars in their place and serving as the real shred of intensity and brutality since Anders completely ditched growling. Double bass gallops, cymbals crash like meteorites in the jungle, toms sound vivid while his playing adds color to such a black and white album. Whenever I think about this album or the one after it, I look forward most to his playing rather than anything accumulated by the rest.\n\nStudio Fredman was at the height of its clarity and mixing on this thing for 1999. Everything is much more balanced than on Whoracle and every instrument sounds light and clear. I\u2019d hardly call this melodic death metal the way it was only a couple albums prior; more like heavy / power metal with harsh vocals. There\u2019s a huge emphasis on more Maiden-esque leadwork amongst pushy riffs. The lack of aggression is the first off-putting feeling. Gone is the bulk of that arcane Studio Fredman guitar tone and atmosphere defining the previous two albums. Everything follows the same formulaic song structure and hopes to amaze you with the leadwork and a catchy chorus. Colony will always be a mediocre release because of this. It is a run of the mill album with some fine moments, mostly average moments, and some really bad moments.\n\nVocally it\u2019s an embarrassment; Anders should have just quit the band. He doesn\u2019t even growl anymore: screams / talking / and griping all thrown into a blender plus atrociously off-key clean vocals rarely touched on. That\u2019s what Colony happens to be stuck with, and don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s any difference between his singing here and his singing on Soundtrack To Your Escape aside from more whining. Shallow and dull characterize his voice; personification is out of the question. It's the one major problem I have with this album aside from the shift in direction. Anytime I listen to \"Scorn\" I cringe.\n\nBeauty in the form of sound waves projected from the strings of guitars dripping with emotion, life, and treatment for the heart and soul \u2013 the guitars on this album do not accomplish such the majority of the time. They meet it halfway. They\u2019re standard heavy metal leads aiming to impress with flare and some form of dignity, and sometimes this turns out just fine. As much as I dislike Anders\u2019 vocals, \u201cOrdinary Story\u201d is the finest example of a simple song with spirit. It\u2019s got a mystic atmosphere, depressive background rhythm, and a cruel lead \u2013 if Anders wasn\u2019t in it, then it\u2019d be one of my favorite songs. Otherwise the rest of them cater to extremely melodic leads without any feeling, thus remaining on an average level. It's why Colony beats Whoracle on the whole - having mostly average songs with a couple standouts as opposed to having an album with either shit songs or good ones.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many bad songs, but mediocrity sums of the whole thing. For the good things about the album - \"Man Made God,\" \"Insipid 2000,\" the title track, \"Embody The Invisible,\" \"Ordinary Story,\" and \"Zombie, Inc.\" - lackluster ones like the \"Coerced Coexistence\" and \"Resin\" don't do much that's interesting to be above standard melodic death and ultimately keep the album from reaching its full potential. If I wanted better leads I\u2019d listen to Desultory, epicness would lead me to Destroyer 666, and better growls = Intestine Baalism. Regardless though, these songs are fun and would do well in a concert atmosphere where you wouldn\u2019t give as much of a shit. Too bad the band can\u2019t even replicate these own songs anymore, which is fucked up since the exact same members playing today are the ones on this album.\n",
        "\nIf you had me review this album three years ago, it\u2019d be quite the fanboy rant. This album never was my favorite of early In Flames, but now that I\u2019ve had all these years for it to sink in I\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s not my favorite because it\u2019s a bland, cowardly attempt at its own genre. I find Klimt 1918 to be even more aggressive than these guys now, which is saying a lot. The Jester Race lost its awe over the years, but that album still had a great tracklist heavily inspired by power metal with some style. Here it just sounds redundant, lame, and contrived while still drawing strictly Maiden influences.\n\nVocals got tamer, sadly, when with the two prior vocalists they had some vigor and hostility to them. Even Anders on the prior album I can dig because he sounds so twisted, but here it\u2019s a false scream / growl with very little lasting power. It doesn\u2019t fit nicely with the music and actually gets buried under the whole thing \u2013 I know this guy could growl, he did it on the last album, so where is it? Even his clean vocals on the Depeche Mode cover, which is an awful cover in itself, just solidifies the fact that his voice is changing for the worst \u2013 the first sign for fans who would be sorely disappointed with In Flames\u2019 direction from here on. The vocals have no real energy or appeal to them in anyway, so to me it\u2019s the biggest offense to a band that had no problem with it spanning three vocalists until the release of this album.\n\nProduction is supposed to be better than The Jester Race, but the riffs don\u2019t sound like it. I'm a huge fan of that Studio Fredman mid-to-late '90s arcane guitar tone. In fact, the more brooding and vintage qualities of the previous album album overpower the synthetic ones despite the lack of proper tooling. I don\u2019t want to pull out the nightstick just yet, since the drumming, as stock as it is, sounds better than the vocals. Gelotte knew what the hell he was doing on some of these songs when it came to bouncy patterns and how to put on a jovial performance, but his intensity dropped a few notches.\n\nBass kind of\u2026 runs\u2026 with not much to grasp. Then again, most of the songs are shallow in nature and don\u2019t really go beyond what you hear within their time limits. That\u2019s another thing this album lacks \u2013 depth (it starts with \"Food For The Gods\"). Maiden\u2019s songs you could envision something, paint a picture, etc. That's a rare feeling on Whoracle. Some songs just have shitty riffs: \u201cGyroscope,\u201d which I still fail to see what makes it such a staple, has one of the most annoying choruses in the genre and a muddy riff to go along with it. Not even the solo on it feels that it can do such a travesty any justice. Which is weird, considering that songs I find eating shit somehow redeem themselves (rather miniscule, though) when the solos hit: \u201cThe Hive\u201d I thought sounded like a jackhammer in a haystack, but as soon as that power \u2013esque solo contributed I knew there was something to headbang to. It sounds so classical and epic, even though I know a portion of it sounds stolen from Arch Enemy's \"Fields Of Desolation\" (the part at 3:20). Others like \"Worlds Within The Margin\" and \"Jester Script Transfigured\" have nice melodies within their plodding structure.\n\nWhat disappoints me is how such a tight guitar duo faltered. They were capable enough of not only writing good riffs, but performing them as well. They dumbed down the music instead. Colony kicks the shit out of this, and that's only a few levels up. Here they still manage to retain their power metal style, creating an atmosphere where the old ways still had authority in the last days of an aging realm. \u201cJotun\u201d has power metal ties and flare that suits itself well and the instrumental \u201cDialogue With The Stars\u201d still shows the band proving that they can infuse something interesting without relying on choruses. \"Episode 666\" is standard fair but it's a fun song to listen to with its more aggressive nature. For In Flames fans, this one is a half and half. You\u2019ll probably love it if you took the same route I did when listening to metal, but you\u2019ll agree that it isn\u2019t anything to top most melodic death of its time. Give it some more time and you\u2019ll rarely see yourself coming back to this one. Hear one song after a while and it\u2019ll remind you exactly why.\n",
        "\nSTOP! STOP! What the hell is this? I heard this shit growing up, and back then it was called metalcore. This is like trying to revive the worst of the Reroute To Remain days and filling it in with alternative rock. The only thing that make this song remotely metal is Daniel Svensson, who still remains the only worthy member of the band with his gnarly double bass, frantic beats, and so forth. Anders went from growling, to screaming, to just plain whining. It honestly is just clean vocals with a little bit more harshness to it. Wow, I\u2019m at the bridge, and it\u2019s completely ripped off from an pop / emo album \u2013 I can\u2019t remember the name, but I swear I\u2019ve heard it before. The riffs I can compare to Jimmy Eat World, who have more talent in the end to this band (no joke, I love Jimmy Eat World). The bass can at least be heard, but it just passes behind the powerless guitars, which aren\u2019t aiming at being metal anyway.\n\nThe instrumental version is also just a waste of time, sans Anders not singing. That still isn\u2019t saying much, since as you\u2019ve obviously read it\u2019s horrible even without the vocals. The music video is just the band performing live with flames spewing out in front of their sell-out logo with fans eating it all up like dog biscuits. Pathetic.\n\nAvoid all In Flames after Clayman and stick to the old stuff. I\u2019m not saying it to sound underground and metal, I\u2019m saying it because it\u2019s fucking common sense.\n",
        "\nThe In Flames you probably know today is absolutely nothing like the In Flames about a decade and a half ago. Back in 1996, no In Flames fan in their right minds could have predicted that the same band would later release Soundtrack To Your Escape. So please, don't run away when you hear the words 'In Flames.' This album really is almost as worthy, if not AS essential to the Gothenburg genre as The Gallery by Dark Tranquility, Slaughter of the Soul from At The Gates, or Stigmata from Arch Enemy. This album may be power metal influenced, but make no mistake it is indeed dark while still being very atmospheric and beautiful.\n\n\"Moonsheild\" is an appropriate prologue into \"Jester's Dance,\" and sets the tone for the rest of the album quite accurately. \"Artifacts of the Black Rain\" is basically everything I would want from he Gothenburg scene, but with a unique power metal twist. Amazing, catchy riffs, kickass solo, drumming that doesn't blow, and pretty cool vocals. This never lets up throughout the remainder of the album. \n\nYes, some people may not be a fan of the power metal twist, and that is understandable. What this does though, is it differentiates themselves from the rest of the scene. They took melodic death metal and made it their own, not unlike At The Gates or Dark Tranquility. Every single song on The Jester Race is filled with unbelievably catchy melodic death/power metal riffs that will bring you to tears. Str\u00f6mblad and Ljungstr\u00f6m are incredible at what they do, as is Frid\u00e9n. Frid\u00e9n's vocals are indeed melodic death metal vocals. There are no shitty clean emo sections like in Reroute to Remain or A Sense of Purpose, so once again, don't even worry about that.\n\nBasically, avoid new In Flames (and for that matter, Soilwork and Arch Enemy, as well) and sink your teeth into some classic melodic death metal. Enjoy your time travel back into the 90s Gothenburg scene!\n\nHighlights: Moonsheild, Dead Eternity, Jester Race, December Flower\n",
        "\nA lot of people consider Colony by In Flames to be not only their best album, but a landmark album also. Though I don\u2019t fully agree with it being their best album, it sure is one of their better albums, and a damn catchy one at that. \n\nI think one of the reasons as to why most people consider this to be their greatest work would be that this is clearly their catchiest album by far. They really went over the top on this one to make the average listener fell good with the melodies in this one. The melodies aren\u2019t really anything to point out on creative wise, buy they\u2019re catchy as hell and well get stuck in your head. \n\nThey went overboard also on the production for just about everything. This is a very clean album unlike their early work link on Lunar Strain. Yet even though it\u2019s very clean they also managed to make it pleasant to listen to and not get tiresome. When listening to the rhythm guitar you can really hear a crunch to it which doesn\u2019t make it sound weak or worthless, and the bold lead guitar sticks out with every solo (which all sound pretty cool). \n\nNow it wouldn\u2019t be an In Flames review without mentioning Anders and his vocals now would it? We should all know the drill by now do you think? He is monotone, lacking emotion and strength, cant do growls, kind of whiney in later work, and so on. Yet like it or not, this is the best album Anders gives a vocal performance on. I think it has to do for two reasons only also. One of them would be how this is the first album where Anders starts to test out new vocal approaches that sound decent enough not to piss the listener off. The last few albums that they released with Anders he mostly does these raspy growls that pretty much get annoying after excessive listening to. This album also has some growls that and mediocre, but take the song \u201cOrdinary Story\u201d for example. First thing you notice about Anders vocals are he\u2019s not doing any growls at first, instead he opens the song with low clean verse then goes into more high pitched screams. On Clayman or Reroute to Remain he goes overboard on the high screams and they get annoying, and the low moans on Clayman also feel off. This might be why fans don\u2019t really care for those albums vocal performances. I mean everything Anders uses on Colony he also uses on Clayman/Reroute, he just doesn\u2019t go overboard. \n\nLike I said the production is nicely done on this one, it also helps the vocals. All the songs on this album have an echo over Anders voice. At the end of every line he sings you can hear it echoing, which helps with some atmosphere a little bit, but nothing amazing. After hearing the echoes on every song however it can get a tad annoying.\n\nWell if you want to talk song structure and writing this album is about the same you would expect for In Flames. Every song follows the same pattern that all their songs follow. You got the opening riff, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, and the closer, just like every In Flames song out there. So if you\u2019re hoping that this album would be different structure wise, you\u2019re out of luck. Lyrically this album is decent. The lyrics aren\u2019t the total crappy whiney nonsense like their newest album, but they also don\u2019t flow together in a way to make a concept album like Whoracle was. They\u2019re kind of fantasy based and also a little personal based, so their kind of interesting, but nothing to rave about. \n\nAnyways, this is a pretty good In Flames album. It\u2019s hands down their catchiest album, and Anders sounds natural and the best on this to all their albums. If you can tolerate Gothenburg music or really catchy music with a positive feeling for that matter I would say get this album.\n",
        "\nIn Flames are an enigma in the metal world. Not for any normal misconceptions like \"how did they go from awesome melodic Death Metal to shitty pop rock,\" or anything like that, but they're an enigma to me because I don't understand why they're popular, why anyone cares about them or why they have fans at all, really.\n\nIn a way, though, their newest full length A Sense of Purpose is a release. A release from hiding, per se, from hiding all these years their true intentions. People will crow on about how The Jester Race and Lunar Strain were good albums, but most of those people don't know what the fuck they're talking about, and I say those albums were mediocre, and In Flames was never good. This new stuff? There are people who say this is a progression, and that it's entertaining and listenable - yeah, that's a fucking hoot, that right there. This is kind of like handing a little kid a loaded gun. Before, they were just fooling around and not really causing any harm, but with this album, they've finally found the trigger and pulled it, blowing away any pretension of being anything other than annoying crap. It sounds like the old stuff except here they're not trying to be dark or insightful or even metal at all. In fact, they're not even really trying at all, to do anything.\n\nWhat? They even admit it in the verses of the first song! \"We aren't even trying/Let this light explode,\" says resident angsty muppet Anders Friden in one of his more honest moments, and I could just end this whole thing right there, because what more do I have to say? They've already said it all for me. I guess the \"let this light explode\" part refers to the anger of whoever suffers the misfortune of having to listen to it, maybe the sound engineers who had to produce it. Boy, do I feel sorry for them.\n\nBut I might as well persevere. This album is just terrible, with no real thought or creativity put into it. Everything about this is just bland, bland, bland, with no distinguishing features aside from the abysmally shitty \"harsh\" vocals from Anders. There is a lot of lyrical moaning on here about constant failure and other self-pitying drivel that I'm sure they spent a torturous and agonizing fifteen minutes writing in between mascara-lathering sessions. This is heavy, but it's really just horribly executed radio fodder at the end of the day (there is a good way to do radio friendly, but this is not it), with a guitar tone that stinks up the room faster than your brother's old gym socks and vocals that are so bad that they should be shipped into outer space for the martians to study. Seriously, this is just awful. Anders Friden puts no effort at all into singi---well, making the noises he does here, as due to the constraints of my hatred for this album, I refuse to call it singing. Every vocal line on here amounts to nothing more than pussy-whipped radio crooning sung in a more strained and harsh fashion, and it is absolutely agonizing. What is wrong with this band? How could they have ever possibly thought this album was a good idea?\n\nI mean, just look at the eight minutes of torture they decided to call \"The Chosen Pessimist.\" Half of it is really just lifeless guitar plunking with some \"emotional\" whispered clean vocals, before it \"explodes\" into a stale and turgid set of heavier plodding riffs, before finally ending without any real conclusion and seguing into the very shitty \"Sober and Irrelevant.\" None of these songs have any identities otherwise. They're all around the same length and even the riffs sound way too similar, but then again, every fucking radio pop-metal band ever uses riffs like this anyway. The melodies on this album, nice as they might be, were all stolen from Iron Maiden and other better bands, so I can't really praise the band for that.\n\nOh, and if the album itself wasn't insulting enough, just check out the video for the first song \"The Mirror's Truth,\" which features the amazing cinematographic acting skills of a bunch of guys dressed up as ugly, fat blobs running around in pink and white clothing while the band rocks out, man. I'm dead serious, that is the basic premise of the video. I sure wish I could use that EXIT door they're showing in there, that's for sure. Good lord, this is terrible. Do people really find this entertaining? The lack of effort here is just astonishing, even in the context of the band's admittance of that! It's like they were physically trying to create something using as little of their brain cells as possible, to create something that would inflict the maximum amount of pain on anyone who dared watch it.\n\nBut really, what is the worst thing about this at the end of the day? That Goddamned self-piteous, whinging, I'm-so-tormented attitude that has plagued so many bands these days. What could possibly be entertaining about listening to a grown man whine about \"killing what burns inside\" or \"I feel like shit, but at least I feel something\"? What could possibly be gleaned at all from that? It's pathetic, just another lifeless attempt to cash in on the feeble, angst-ridden minds of the fourteen year old '00 generation that think they have it so hard. Here's an idea: If you think you have it hard, with your two-story house, outdoor pool, married set of parents and nice clothes, how about you come over here so I can bash your fucking head through a wall and break your In Flames CDs in half? Now cheer the fuck up, enjoy what you have and stop listening to this crap!\n\nAs it stands, the only thing this album is good for is bludgeoning your brain slowly into a catatonic state if you just can't fuckin' take it anymore, like the lyrics seem to say a lot. This is so monotonous and one-dimensional that it actually lulls the listener into an altered state of consciousness if listened to for long enough, and unless you want that to happen, avoid this turd like you would avoid a frontal lobotomy handled by a monkey with a wrench, because A Sense of Purpose is too wretched to be allowed breathing space.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s face it; everyone who browses this site or listens to metal should know who In Flames are. And I know a lot of you out there well\u2026.hate them. Then again, a lot of you out there (like me) love them. We all have our own opinion when it comes to this band, or any sort of metal for that matter. Anyways, this is one of my favorite albums from one of my favorite Gothenburg bands. \n\nLooking back on this album and comparing it to their latest album A Sense of Purpose or to their other early Gothenburg work like The Jester Race you wouldn\u2019t think that this is the same band. One of the major differences is the vocals by Dark Tranquillity front man Mikael Stanne. He was only a one time vocalist for the band but he did a great job on the vocals for the Lunar Strain album. As much as I enjoy Anders vocals (seriously I don\u2019t mind him) on The Jester Race and what not, I still believe that Mikael did a better job for the vocals on all of In Flames work. The more harsh vocals with the more evil sound and the small trace of black metal fit in with the dark tone of the guitars and helps improve to the atmosphere of the album. \n\nThe song selection is not what you would expect from In Flames in this one. They have the astronomy lyrical songs like early In Flames did, but they also have a few of these acoustic folk style songs mixed in with some violin sounding instrumental pieces like \u201cHargalaten\u201d. There are a lot of acoustic breaks in about half the songs on the album, from the opening track \u201cBehind Space\u201d where it\u2019s at the last minute or so, halfway through \u201cIn Flames\u201d or the whole song like \u201cEverlost (Part II)\u201d. These moments bring a lot more variety to the table, even though they don\u2019t fit completely with the guitar tone or the vocals on the album, they are a nice addition to the album and bring out the album from being a more linear style Gothenburg album.\n\nThe guitars are a lot lower toned and darker sounding compared to other In Flames work. The melodies are there, just in a darker sound. They are lighter in the instrumental song \u201cDreamscape\u201d; they feel much lighter and happier I guess you could say. The bass is audible for the most part, it mostly follows the rhythm guitar though so that\u2019s kind of a bummer, and although it follows the rhythm guitar it has its own part in \u201cDreamscape\u201d which I fought was quite cool.\n\nThis is one of In Flames Best albums, and one of the best albums that came out for Gothenburg music for quite some time. My biggest problem other than the folk elements that don\u2019t feel in place at times is the fact that the album is kind of short. The entire album is only 36 minutes, which I find to be kind of short. Most people out there won\u2019t mind these few flaws because they will be appalled at the fact that it is Gothenburg music in the first place. To me Gothenburg music isn\u2019t about slamming your head against the wall or five minute guitar solos or having a song with over 300 riffs, its about the atmosphere, emotion, and melodies given off by the guitars. Fans of Gothenburg music will know what I\u2019m talking about, and they all know why they also love this album so much. This is a Gothenburg classic.\n",
        "\nLoving In Flames always felt like Gollem loving the ring for me. It shouldn\u2019t be good, and if I try I can actually find many negatives. Yet, I can\u2019t stop loving it. The shivers down your spine you get when you listen something that really touches you (in a bang your head away form or a soothing ballad form) are uncontrollable. So is my love for In Flames.\n\nAlmost every song on here has the same set-up, atmosphere and layout, but unlike Soilwork I don\u2019t get annoyed by it. Mainly it is because there is not a obvious change from a groovy verse to a majestic loud chorus. Sure, the choruses are the shiny moments of every song, but that doesn\u2019t mean the verses are there for no purpose other than filling the space up. It\u2019s all still headbangable, and not completely devoid of melodies. The so-called groovy parts are present (somewhat), but again unlike Soilwork there is no abundance of melodies. The fact that there are two guitarists is clear in almost every riff. There are many harmonies within the riffs, creating an insant message to the brain that there is a melody. It also layers the sound a bit which is very nice, just like there is a synthesizer present staying rather faithfully on the sideline, waiting to kick in a superb melody. (Move through me\u2026 chorus\u2026)\n\nEven Anders Friden, one of metal\u2019s most hated vocalists ever doesn\u2019t get on my nerves. He is no Roy Kahn or Bruce Dickinsen whatsoever, or Ross Dolan if anything, but he is not bad either. I guess it\u2019s a more personal thing as I can understand his voice unnerves people. The other band members are very decent at their job. In Flames has never been the virtuoso band, aside from a few guitar solo\u2019s from Jesper. Still, their songwriting talent is as good as it was 12 years ago. The melodies don\u2019t feel very recycled, which is quite a thing as metal exists for almost 40 years already. The verses with the groove metal influences are by far not as good as the choruses, but I take it for granted. Especially since, although it\u2019s obviously groove metal influenced, it\u2019s not without any melody. There are lots of melodies in the verses, and if there aren\u2019t soon enough the song flows smoothly into the pre-chorus/chorus with a massive set up of 2 guitarists, 1 keyboard and 1 vocalist. Enough material to create some magnificent melodies I think.\n\nAll in all, this record may be not very metal, but it\u2019s still the same quality. Almost every song shares the same \u201cidea\u201d, aside from the controversial \u201cThe Chosen Pessimist\u201d which has become a hated/loved track. And though the other songs don\u2019t differ that much, there are still lots of moments when I know specifically which song and which part it is. \n\nRecommended tracks: Move through me (great, great, great chorus), Condemned, The Mirror\u2019s Truth, Sleepless Again, The Chosen Pessimist and for anyone having the bonus tracks: Eraser.\n\nThank you and goodnight, precious.\n",
        "\nOk so you form a band, you release some albums usually about 4 or so. You get a huge fan base (as well as a huge hater base). Then you tour and release a live album. That\u2019s exactly what In Flames decided to do. Well, sort of. \n\nThis is a live album from In Flames, and it got released right in the middle of their career as a band (where they switched from Gothenburg to modern rock/metal). So the album consists of their old Gothenburg songs to some of their modern rock ones from Clayman. Now the album was released in 2001, so the majority of the tracks on here are from the previous 2 albums Colony and Clayman. So if you did not like those albums for whatever reasons, best to avoid this one. \n\nNow the only 2 things to consider in this one are:\n\n1) Song selection\n2) Production\n\nI mean that\u2019s really all there is to a live album, if they picked good songs that you and the fans like and if the whole live production a great, great as in you can hear the crowd screaming, band gets in the performance, extended guitar solos, and so forth.\n\nThe song selection is the main thing that will keep people away from this one. Tracks mostly come from Colony and Clayman, although there are also tracks from Whoracle, and 1 track each from Lunar Strain and The Jester Race. But that\u2019s the problem with the whole thing. There\u2019s not enough of their old material on this one. The majority of it is off Clayman so they were most likely touring for their Clayman album when this was produced. But still, you can\u2019t just have 1 song from your early material. They got \u201cBehind Space\u201d at least, which is one of their best songs on here and in general. The only song they got from The Jester Race is \u201cMoonshield\u201d. And to tell you the truth, I don\u2019t even like that song. They should at least have done \u201cArtifacts of the Black Rain\u201d. That\u2019s one of their best on that album. \n\nThis album has the weirdest \u201clive\u201d production I have ever heard. It has the live feel from the band themselves, but that\u2019s about it. You hear next to no audience throughout almost the whole thing. You hear some screams and applause in some songs like in \u201cOnly for the Weak\u201d but that is about it. I mean in a live album I just expect lots more, I expected lots of screams/cheering from the crowd, extending guitar/drum solos, and some conversation between the band and the fans. Well, Anders does talk to the audience after most of the song, but it takes 4-5 songs in it before he does anything like that. And to make things worse, it sounds like it\u2019s edited/cut off. He\u2019ll talk and it just switches to the next song, like they were trying to save time or something. If it\u2019s a live album why would you edit it? That kind of takes out the live part of it, the part where you feel like your there even though your not. That is what The Tokyo Showdown cannot accomplish. \n\nSo what we are looking at is a live album in the middle of In Flames career, with some fucked up production that makes it feel like it\u2019s not live. Its like hearing Colony and Clayman live in an oversized studio with In Flames and with about 15 Japanese people in the background. The over edited transition between songs is the worst part of this one, it\u2019s even worse than the song selection. I personally didn\u2019t mind the song selection because I kind of liked those 2 albums. But for those of you who didn\u2019t like them. Stay the hell away from this live album.\n",
        "\nThe overproduced garbage that plagues later In Flames releases is entirely absent here. This album is what melodic death metal can be if done correctly. Overall it is a great album, although it is admittedly inconsistent; sometimes it feels like a demo in that there are incomplete and bizarre songs that don't fit.\n\nWith \"Behind Space,\" instantly the album draws the listener into a storm of melodic metal riffs, great demonic vocals, and great headbanging passages. The album continues throughout with a similar sound. There is a melodic base of classic heavy metal mixed with death metal riffing. On top of this base, the drums and bass are fairly simple but great for the music.\n\nThe vocals on this album, done by Mikael Stanne from Dark Tranquillity, are better than any other In Flames album by far. They are harsh and evil-sounding, and make sure that everyone knows that it is still extreme metal, despite the melodic elements.\n\nThe problems I have with this album lies in the middle. \"Everlost Pt. 1\" is slow, and although it has some great riffs, sort of kills the momentum the cosmos-themed first four tracks have. \"Everlost Pt. 2\" is an acoustic song with fairly annoying clean female singing over it. I'm not really sure what it's doing on the album because the melodies and guitar parts have nothing in relation to Part 1, and its folk sound kills the epic mood of the first half of the album.\n\n\"Hargalaten\" is an instrumental track based on a violin melody that follows the Everlosts, and it feels like it's thrown in the middle of the album for the hell of it. It's not a bad track, but overall it doesn't flow with the rest of the album.\n\nThe ending tracks of the album are all great in their own ways (especially the mid-tempo riff on \"In Flames\" which is amazing) but can't fully save this album from its problems. Still, the semi-raw quality and melodic sensibility through evil atmosphere throughout this album makes it one of the best \"Gothenburg\" releases.\n",
        "\nSeen by many as a return to the glorious days of old In Flames, Come Clarity divided metalheads almost as much as the previous two albums. Is it really a return to the band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purer melodic death metal roots? Not really. Is it a good album? Pretty much, but it still doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat their first 4-5 albums in terms of quality, not by a long shot. Come Clarity is a competent modern melodic death metal album by a still-talented band that unfortunately may on occasion attract the wrong crowds. Earlier this year when getting some albums autographed by the band I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve personally been told by what could easily be called a scene kid that this album was his favourite In Flames album (his favourite overall band was Slipknot so yeah, go figure\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). \n\nMusically the album starts with its first single, Take This Life, which is incidentally one of the heaviest on the album, along with the (feeble) Scream. Fortunately Take This Life is pretty good, with In Flames\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 characteristic melodic riffs (quite fast-paced for this particular song) and some of Daniel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best drumming, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably one of the band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more talented members along with the two guitarists. The overall production is excellent, everything can be easily heard and the drums sound particularly solid, while a little too heavy on the cymbals at times. Having a solid opener like this one really helps the album develop (unlike Soundtrack to your Escape whose opener was about as good as the album\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation among metalheads). The following songs are some of the best new songs In Flames wrote since the Clayman album, including Leeches, Reflect the Storm, and the pretty cool duet on Dead End, with Swedish singer Lisa Miskovsky singing along with Anders in the chorus. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the better moments of new In Flames, as these songs are some of the most successful examples of the new In Flames: very melodic riffs combined with their general fast-paced song structure and good drumming, actually an improvement on some of their older stuff in that department, which creates catchy songs whose only real fault may be Anders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 less-than-optimal vocals even though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not that hard to get used to. The bass lines, handled by Peter Iwers, are pretty good, helped by the great production, although nothing really outstanding.\n\nUnfortunately the album takes a dive in quality after those first four songs, the aforementioned Scream being pretty damn lame and bland while trying to be all fast-paced and aggressive (In Flames are melodic death metal and good at it; they should never, ever try to imitate thrash metal, since they horribly fail at it). The whole song has neither enough variation nor a solid, catchy chorus (which is after all one of the band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trademark elements). After that sad attempt at aggression, they come with the album\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s title track and its second single, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad but Anders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clean vocals aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best ever (then again; *remembers The Chosen Pessimist*). Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty strong song, with a decent acoustic guitar intro and it even has a nice melodic solo although it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch their old technical wonders such as the one on The Hive, off Whoracle. \n\nNow we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re approximately at the halfway point in the album and the point where the previous Soundtrack to your Escape turned from good music to songs which somewhat lacked variation. Fortunately Come Clarity fares somewhat better, at least for a while. Vacuum is aggressive, almost reminiscent of the half-hearted attempt at thrash on Scream but also features an excellent melodic and catchy chorus. Then comes Pacing Death\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trail, an excellent melodic death metal song which is on par with the best of mid-era In Flames, as is the case for the subsequent Crawl through Knives, featuring the best melodic riffs on the entire album and a chorus that rocks to top it off. Anders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vocals, both clean and harsh, are truly strong on these last two tracks, a quality that slowly but surely gets rarer as time goes by. The last few songs lose some of the uniqueness that made the rest of the album great though. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still good but none of them are anything particularly special. The album ends with Your Bedtime Story is Scaring Everyone, a relaxing instrumental with some weird distortion/radio chatter in the background, until the last minute-and-a-half when Anders starts singing (badly) and a kind of hidden track starts which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t amazing. The synths are pretty good overall though and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice end to a good album. \n\nOverall the album is quite varied. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of those albums which are easy to listen to when doing something else, such as driving a car or playing a game, while still being able to appreciate the music and get it stuck in your head in an enjoyable way. The catchiness and diversity present in Come Clarity are pretty much trademarks for In Flames throughout their career except maybe the first album but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a functional formula which creates enjoyable albums, much better than the metalcore which was subsequently spawned by this form of melodic death metal. \n\nSo Come Clarity is pretty good, nothing breathtaking but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still underrated, as is most of In Flames\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 newer music. The album is a good example of newer melodic death metal done as it should be, unlike, say, Soilwork, and while the whole thing is far from perfect (some filler, some average vocals as well as a select few downright shitty songs), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty damn good. The artwork on the album is pretty lame though and so is the notebook-style rough draft writing inside the booklet for the lyrics, which makes them both ugly and hard to read. I guess the artwork is a taste of things to come with A Sense of Purpose, whose artwork makes this look like one of Mesaccio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Renaissance masterpieces.\n",
        "\nHearing the overall sound of this album, I sense that In Flames have gone a few years back in time with this album, as in my ears this one sounds more like Soundtrack To Your Escape than any other In Flames album. Is this bad? No, I would say, as I enjoyed Soundtrack, and every other album In Flames has ever made. The greatest difference are the vocals, as there are by far more clean vocals on this album, although they are not entirely clean, but somewhere inbetween, with a stronger link to clean than to grunts.\n\nStarting off with the more than enjoyable riff of The Mirror's Truth, which had also been released as a single in advance, this album features different aspects that we've already heard before from In Flames, but also some completely new things, and even sometimes a throwback to In Flames before they changed their sound. \n\nA Sense Of Purpose has this typical modern, clean guitar sound, which I actually find rather enjoyable in this case. We had already heard that from In Flames, indeed, but on this album it is even cleaner. Vocalist Anders Friden shines on tracks like Disconnected, despite the bit of lyrical cheese(I seem not to be the only one who thinks this), in which they have found a good balance between (quite) heavy riffs and very melodic and catchy melodies. Alias deserves a special note, because it has this beautiful acoustic part in the middle of the song, which sounds like a throwback to old songs such as Moonshield and Pallar Anders Visa. Move Through Me is an outstanding track for me, the intro is nice, but nothing special, but the sweeping rythms in the (pre)chorus are tremendous, and the song also features a nice solo and a breakdown, something which, in my eyes, always demonstrates a certain amount of professionalism, which is of course something we may expect from these Swedish metal veterans.\n\nOutstanding and very special track is The Chosen Pessimist. It is a long, atmospheric ballad, which doesn't really sound like anything In Flames has ever done before. Does this mean the next album will be another experiment, and they will overthrow their style again? I am curious about this, very curious. The track starts with a long intro, and slowly builds up on strength. It has parts with vocals, and instrumental parts, and after a long while the distorted, heavier, guitar finally kicks in. This only lasts for a short period of time, because then another breakdown is inserted, after which the song gets heavier for the last time. This time it also features some vocals, and it lasts longer, to abruptly end the song, and kick the heavy riff of Sober And Irrelevant in.\n\nNot the whole album was as clean as I said, the last track, March To The Shore, is a bit rawer than the rest, and seems a natural continuation of this album's preceder, Come Clarity. \n\nAnyone who liked Reroute To Remain, Soundtrack To Your Escape and Come Clarity, should be able to appreciate this one too. However, if you already dropped out after Clayman, I don't think you'll like this one either. Whether their next full-length will be a surprise or not, is a question we'll have to ask, a question for which I do not want to await the answer.\n",
        "\nIn Flames really knew how to create perfection back in the golden days of melodic death metal. Whoracle is their third full length and follow up to The Jester Race, their previous masterpiece. Here we are shown a more angry, aggressive approach to the sound, still containing excellent and appropriately used melody.\n\nWhoracle is a concept album based on humanity becoming increasingly advanced until we bring upon our own doom as a result of ignorance and misused power. These apocalyptic themes are present in all songs, some more than others (Jotun, Episode 666) and give the album tremendous focus. Focus within the sound of the music is something In Flames are generally consistent in yet excelled in the area on early releases. On Whoracle, it is achieved by a varying sound. Acoustic guitars are used to great effect and the riffs are some of their best. Specifically, the acoustic interlude in The Jester Script Transfigured is atmosphere within itself. It carries a mood of solitude yet hope and remembrance. This leads into a massive crushing wall of riff from Jesper and Bjorn and desperate shrieks of agony from Anders. More diversity in the music includes the layered clean vocals in the chorus of Gyroscope, the violently fast paced Morphing Into Primal, and the slow yet crushing Worlds Within The Margin.\n\nThe riffs are similar to those off of The Jester Race - amazing. The cleaner production gives an entirely different mood to them though. This becomes immediately evident on the unforgettable opener, Jotun. Song writing has become more focussed within the guitars, perhaps best displayed on the instrumental Dialogue With The Stars. Anders gives one of his best performances on Whoracle. The way he spews utter emotion and anguish into every growl makes for an incredibly memorable presentation. The lyrics are simply the best the band has produced and some of the best I have come across. Each song is built up of remarkable poetry about human weakness and failure.\n\nIf people don\u2019t like this album it must be because they don\u2019t like the genre in general because coming from a fan of melodic death metal, this is top of the class. In Flames certainly don\u2019t make music like this anymore, no one does. It\u2019s hard to find good melodeath these days, most bands carry metalcore influences or turn shitty after one album. But when you have classics like these to fall back on, why would you need anything else?\n",
        "\nIn Flames get talked about a lot. From their early underground Melodic Death Metal days to their later days as a cocky, goofy, streamlined Alt. Rock band, they are a very popular band - for better or for worse. They were at the forefront of the Melodic Death scene and pretty much set the blueprint for the style, along with Dark Tranquillity and At the Gates. This was their celebrated sophomore effort The Jester Race, and while I don't worship it like some people do, I can still testify to its quality.\n\nLet's just get one thing straight: this is not a Death Metal album. Melodic Death Metal is pretty poorly named, I think, because there isn't much Death-y about it, aside from the fact that the vocals vaguely remind of the old school bands like Entombed or Death. The only reason that this genre of music is called Melodic Death Metal seems to be because there isn't anything else to call it. So, a bit of a misnomer, but whatever.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, let's move onto the music itself (gasp). The music on The Jester Race is not that heavy or extreme, rather focusing on simple riffs and ear-pleasing melodies wrapped up in a tight package of mystical intricacy, not complex or involving at all, but still perhaps needing a few listens to really sink in. While I admire the band's ability to create simple and solid melodies, a lot of the time this just isn't too exciting, with most of the songs just sort of blending together into one solid mass of riffs and growling and solos. The guitar tone is a bit weak, but most of the time the band sounds tight and sober here. It's just that they never get you headbanging or staring in awe at your speakers. The music is competent and well played, but not stirring, emotional or even any fun. \"Moonshield\" is cool, with its acoustic intro bit, and \"December Flower\" has some very colorful melodies amidst the drolling, pounding riffs, but pretty much everything else, while played well, just isn't anything special.\n\nMy problem with this album, and this band as a whole is that a) they have no longevity and b) they are too plain.\n\nWhen I first heard The Jester Race, I thought it was a great album, but ever since then, it has just been getting more and more bland to these ears. This is due to its simplicity. As is the case with many things that are so simple, its pleasures may not last forever, becoming stale or tepid after hours of listening. Hours of familiarity and intimacy with the material. The Jester Race is a pretty good album, but it lacks any sort of oomph to make it memorable or worth playing more than a few times. This is very plain music, lacking any real sort of ambition, and while bands like Omen or Grim Reaper could make \"plain\" music work well by adding some fiery pep and kicking energy to the mix, In Flames are trying at a more moody and esoteric style, and they need a little bit more flair to their music for that. Perhaps more weight on the atmospheric side with their acoustic guitar melodies would make this album more interesting. This...this just doesn't really do anything, as it is.\n\nListening to this is oftentimes like looking at a blank white wall. It might be well flourished and smooth and inoffensive, but it won't provide you with much excitement in the end. I haven't heard all of In Flames' albums, but that analogy seems to sum the band as a whole up pretty well.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nThese past couple of years have been\u2026well, rather interesting to say the least for Sweden\u2019s In Flames. With albums such as Soundtrack To Your Escape and Come Clarity being far cries from their older material like Jester Race and Whoracle, fans are split between whether or not to accept this \u201cnu\u201d In Flames. On one hand, listeners consider it to be the band\u2019s way of reinventing themselves, while on the other; longtime fans are crying \u201csellout\u201d with their new toned-down, melodic approach to their music.\n\nIn Flames\u2019 latest effort, A Sense Of Purpose, is a clear continuation of their previous album, Come Clarity, as the band is catering to newer fans as opposed to their older fans who have longed for them to return to their roots. However, one of the biggest problems with A Sense Of Purpose just like with Come Clarity is that many of the songs are not distinguishable from each other and this makes it a repetitive affair. While a good number of In Flames fans consider Soundtrack To Your Escape their \u201cjump the shark\u201d album, Soundtrack To Your Escape did have distinguishable tracks you could recognize.\n\nNot to say that In Flames hasn\u2019t put any effort into their songs on A Sense Of Purpose, but it feels like they did spew out 12 songs (15 depending on which version of the album you have) to make a quick buck. Looking on the bright side, the quality is crisp and clear in A Sense Of Purpose and newer fans will surely enjoy this if they liked Come Clarity, Reroute To Remain, and so on.\n\nI\u2019m trying to restrain myself from calling vocalist Anders Frid\u00e9n a Swedish version of Jonathan Davis, but I can\u2019t help but notice that he and the rest of the band are getting more and more melodic with their metal sound with each passing release. Especially with their first attempt in making an \u201cepic\u201d ballad, \u201cThe Chosen Pessimist\u201d, it can be a bit irritating hearing Frid\u00e9n getting all \"mushy\".\n\nSo all and all, is A Sense of Purpose a terrible album? It all depends on who you are. If you\u2019re the type of metalhead who regard Jester Race and Colony their greatest material, then this album isn\u2019t for you. But if you happen to be the one who\u2019s open to anything and don\u2019t mind the \u201cnu\u201d In Flames, then maybe this album\u2019s just for you. But if you\u2019re on the fence (just like yours truly), A Sense Of Purpose is hampered by repetitiveness and dull songwriting which is kind of disappointing because I feel there was potential for this to be a good album based on the sound quality.\n",
        "\nThe Jester Race is, by far, an essential G\u00f6thenburg album. It stands next to The Gallery, The Red in the Sky is Ours, and In Flames' own Subterranean as a member of the pantheon of strange melodic goodness that, somehow, ended up screwing up completely. But this isn't about 1995-on (Jester Race was recorded in '95), this is about The Jester Race. \n\nAnders Frid\u00e9n, the well-known vocalist for In Flames, made his debut with this album. His mix of shriek and growl was either well received or not, and I, frankly, am one of the few who take it with either viewpoint. On one hand, I thoroughly enjoy the shrieks in black metal -- the fact that I can stand Virkernes' vocals is a testament to that. The other: I love growls, the sheer brutality and Power that is inherent in such a guttural and strong vocalization. The two combined, therefore, should be a recipe for greatness, but it is not.\n\nUnfortunately, Frid\u00e9n continues to degrade as the years go by, but his vocals were decent and fun to listen to in the beginning, even if it was mostly from novelty. I still have qualms with the majority of vocals in the G\u00f6thenburg genre, but it's something I can live with thanks to the pure musicality of the songs produced by these bands.\n\nSpeaking of musicality, listening to The Jester Race is like listening to different songs -- for the most part, though The Jesters' Dance and The Jester Race share thematic similarities, but that's intentional, I believe -- each one is different than the last. Go ahead, listen to Dead God in Me, and then Artifacts of the Black Rain; it's an incredible change in mood.\n\nEach song follows a structure, but it's not a bad thing. In metal, we usually see what some call a narrative structure, where there isn't a coherent ABAB etc. arrangement of different pieces. In The Jester Race, we see an ABAB with slight variations, but it's done to good effect: it emphasizes motif in each song, which In Flames was definitely not shy about in later albums.\n\nThe lyrics are beautiful, not nonsense like Whoracle and Clayman, and not whining like recent release Come Clarity. Understanding Frid\u00e9n's vocals is a task, but when you do, the lyrics he releases from his throat are outstanding. December Flower is a great example of beauty and brutality mixed.\n\nThe production is clear, but not overly so. It still maintains a degree of atmosphere, while the guitars have enough fuzz to grate the ear a little, but still retain tone. Tone is everything in a melodeath album.\n\nOverall, it's a wonderful album to listen to. In Flames once did masterpieces, and now they don't. It's unfortunate that Colony marked the tragic end of this once-amazing band, but we still have Subterranean and The Jester Race.\n",
        "\nIn Flames got their shit together with this release. Every song on this album is good - not a single dull track. This is an album I can play from Bullet Ride to Another Day in Quicksand without having to worry about that moment where I go, \"Oh shit, this is the boring song I don't like\" *skip*. \n\nNow that doesn't mean that every song is classic material, there's just not a single bad song. I tried looking for a song that didn't have a single good riff or hook - failed. I tried looking for a song that was good and catchy but just not memorable - failed. When you combine great riffs, catchy hooks and original ideas to create an atmospheric album, it's going to turn out excellent. \n\nSome say that this is the album where things started going downhill for In Flames. I say that happened when they changed producers, this is the last album produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m. The difference between this album and its close sibling Colony are the diversity of ideas. They continue the tradition of acoustic breaks with Square Nothing, but also incorporate a spacey sounding acoustic break to introduce Satellites and Astronauts. Each song also has its own little quirk - Only For the Weak is that sing-a-long chorus and the neckbreaking opening riff. Suburban Me is the blurting bass-line in the first verse. Clayman has that arpeggio during the bridge and the circle-pit inducing chorus. Did I mention how well this album is mixed? All the instruments are where they are supposed to be - the bass isn't too muted and carries the rhythm with the drums and the guitars are up front and loud.\n\nThe only thing this album fails to deliver are memorable solos. When I think of Clayman, I think of hooks and catchy songs - not solos, and that is why this is only my second favorite album by In Flames.\n",
        "\nIn Flames has never been known for their sense of humor, but given the title of this DVD and the fact that the vocals are overdubbed makes one wonder if they've turned over a new leaf.\n\nFor starters, this double DVD is LOADED with all kinds of goodness. For starters it contains several promo videos, a handful of live performances and an interview with a random mtv personality. \n\nOn the first DVD there is a double live set, one that consists of the entire 'Soundtrack to Your Escape' album and the other set of classic In Flames tunes. Musically, this is a brilliant performance, with the exception of when the drummer messes up on the first song. The instruments sound as good as ever, the vocals are noticeably dubbed. In the beginning Anders finishes and starts singing when his mouth isn't moving and/or has pulled the mic away to the point where the clarity of his voice wouldn't have come across as such. Plus when he is speaking in between songs the mics volume changes.\n\nThis is enough to give this a 'zero' rating, but given that there are other live performances, and that they are (or at least appear to be) live, coupled with the promo videos and lengthy interview more than makes up for it (or at least enough to give this something in the double digit range as far as a rating goes).\n\nThis is a pretty good DVD as it shows how the band is live, tight and intense. You can tell that they enjoy what they do and that they are for the most part at least, real. This is recommended to fans only.\n",
        "\nAhhh, In Flames a band so many close-minded metal heads love to hate and rightly so. I can understand why they would recieve this hate, although I think a lot of it is misconstrued. For a band to create 5-6 (depending if you like Clayman or not) absolute heavy metal masterpieces and then follow up with a string of so-so releases, is enough to enrage just about anyone. However I pride myself on having a complete open mind with my metal and I find their post-Clayman output to be mostly enjoyable, mostly. \n\nI'm a firm believer that this is their best album since Reroute to Remain. Now most people won't agree with me and will say \"Well Come Clarity is heavier, more pissed and a throwback to their old style\". I understand that argument, I just think ASOP has more memorable songwriting. To enjoy this album you must throw away all your preconceptions of IF being a melodic \"death\" metal band. They pretty much squashed that style somewhere between Whoracle and Colony and became just a regular melodic metal band, albeit a little more aggressive with the harsher vocals utilized. Some would say power metal with harsh vocals. When you sit back and let ASOP grow on you, there is actually a lot to enjoy about it. \n\nThe first 4 songs are clearly geared for mainstream acceptance and possibly even radio play, even though I've never heard IF on the radio before. Dissconnected is a good song and reminds me of old school IF but it does have a certain amount of lyrical cheese that almost kills the entire song. If you can get past that, it's a highly enjoyable song. The next two songs are ok at best and the only thing that stands out about them is during Alias. An awesome acoustic break kicks in and you are transported somewhere back in time around the Subterranean days! Great stuff and that break from time to time will pop into my head and get stuck there. After these first 4 songs the album really starts to pick up the pace and aggressiveness, save the Chosen Pessimist, which is just flat out BORING and slow. \n\nStarting with song 5 and skipping song 8 would be how I would reccommend this album to anyone who prefers the old IF. Move Through Me is really a standout track for me. I really enjoy that song. March to the Shore, Delight and Angers, Sober And Irrelevant, Condemend and Drenched In Fear could be the best songs on the album and are all throwbacks to the old style. With catchy guitar melodies and solos, thrash-y riffs, good, precise drumming and sort of a sing-along style of vocals that will have you rocking out in your car but will piss most die-hards off. The fact that Anders really never uses his old deathy growl at all anymore, is kind of a bummer. \n\nSo overall, I enjoyed this album a lot. Of course it really doesn't compare to their old stuff but it still is well crafted melodic metal that anyone can enjoy. Unless your the type of person who would be worried about what other metalheads would think about you, if they caught you listening to this poser, sellout, faux-death metal band. For me I'm just glad they are putting out music that reminds me of their glory days and that they are still touring.\n",
        "\nI went into this knowing that it would be nothing like 'Whoracle', 'Colony', 'Jester Race', or even 'Clayman'. I went into this bearing releases like Reroute to Remain, and, more recently, Come Clarity in mind. I knew it wasn't going to be as beefy, and I knew I wasn't going to feel the need to sing along like I do when I listen to earlier In Flames releases. Unfortunately, this initial mindset may be the only reason I enjoyed 'A Sense of Purpose' as much as I really did.\n\nWhen I picked up the album I had only heard one song - The Mirrors Truth. I watched the music video and thought to myself 'Hey, it ain't old-old In Flames, but it ain't too bad'. Unfortunately, the album didn't seem to get much better than 'The Mirror's Truth'. I popped the album in as I was driving and rather than cranking the volume and 'rocking out', as suburban teens say, I let my brain sift throught every little layer of sound, every detail of every passage, in order to find something that I really enjoyed. Luckily I did find a few things that made this purchase somewhat worthy. I still do enjoy the single. On top of this, there are a few guitar passages that I really enjoy, one of which being the introduction to 'I'm the Highway'. I really like that riff, don't ask me why. In Flames could have taken this riff and put it on loop for fourty minutes, called it the new album, and I would have enjoyed it just the same. I also like the synth that brings in the chorus to 'Disconnected'. Also, despite the horrid lyrics (which have been mentioned many times), I think the chorus to this song is very catchy and I sometimes sing along when no one is watching. Aside from a couple of other catchy choruses and riffs here and there, the album doesn't have much more to offer.\n\nDespite the catchy riffs that pop up occassionally, the guitar sound on this album is very watered-down. If you listen to some of In Flames' older material, you'll note that the guitars are much more crunchy, more distorted, and just plain louder. On this album, it's almost as if they were buried in the mix. They come out occassionaly to play a shy little solo, but that's about it.\nI also managed to take a few of the riffs and compare them to riffs on 'Come Clarity', as many of them are similar. This gives 'A Sense of Purpose' a sense of being 'Come Clarity Part II'\n\nThe album has many flaws, a few missing peices, but I still give it a spin occassionally for it's few redeeming qualities. I only wish I could have scored a used copy for a much cheaper price.\n",
        "\nI've come to the conclusion that if Soundtrack To Your Escape were a movie, it would be a scat porn. It starts out promising, transforms into one of the most horrible experiences of your life, and still has a few good moments in between that make you wonder if you've been desensitized to the horror around you.\n\nAfter the experimentation on Reroute To Remain, In Flames decided to do what nobody could have ever expected them to do, even after as diverse of an album as Reroute to Remain, they made a synth rock album! Granted, if this was Children of Bodom or Dark Tranquillity making this album then I wouldn't be as pissed, but this is In Flames and they don't even have a full time keyboardist. Hell, the keyboards are louder than the guitars in several parts of the album!\n\nThe first track, F(r)iend is a throwback to the old albums, but it only gets you to think that STYE is actually worth hearing before it degenerates into unlistenable garbage. Even the better tracks after F(r)iend are either too simplistic or filled with synths to the point that their session keyboardist is more responsible for their creation than the band itself.\n\nThe guitars aren't doing anything special. Jesper apparently forgot how to play guitar in the two years in between Reroute To Remain and this vile piece of trash. The synths (which aren't even a real part of the band) are playing infinitely more interesting parts than the guitars, which stick to simple riffs. And this was the band who wrote songs like Jotun and Bullet Ride, two songs that had some of the coolest riffs of all time. Jesper can obviously write some good riffs but he seems to have gone through severe writer's block when writing the songs.\n\nAnders isn't performing much better than Jesper. His growls occur at the absolute most awkward times and are the same type of multilayered cookie monster grows that Glen Benton uses. The more common type of vocals performed would be Anders clean singing which often sounds like he's poorly impersonating Jonathan Davis while his voice cracks uncontrollably. When he isn't doing either he's either screaming or putting all sorts of studio effects and multitracking on his voice in order to cover up the fact that he sucks as he attempts to do things that he clearly couldn't do until very recently. Anders was never all that great but he is at least tolerable on their other albums. On STYE, he just comes across as totally untalented and sounds like he hasn't rehearsed any of this beforehand and just rushed his vocal performance like everybody but Daniel seems to have done.\n\nMaking matters worse, songs like Evil in a Closet go nowhere despite attempting to make the song diverse. When your songs don't seem to progress at all, they should be left on the cutting room floor. The lack of musical ideas is painfully apparent, but the band should have at least asked their label for some additional time to record a new album rather than rushing this out the door and hiring a session keyboardist to incorporate his ideas into the music. The real issue is that In Flames knew that after the success of Reroute to Remain, they could put their name on anything and it would sell a ton of copies.\n\nIt's not just the album that's bad either, it's the videos. This album spawned a total of 6 singles with a video made for each of them. The videos for F(r)iend, The Quiet Place, and My Sweet Shadow are well produced, but the other three are each horrible in their own way. \n\nLike You Better dead is all CGI and just featured pictures of the band at certain points. It took as much effort from the band to make as the actual CD did, which is pitiful since this is one of the few (relatively) good tracks on the disc. It also featured a teddy bear being hunted down by a robot which is one of the dumbest concepts that I've ever heard of. The sad part is that it apparently had a pretty big budget for a music video.\n\nThen there's the infamous Touch of Red video. For those of you who don't know, In Flames is a European metal band, yet they try to act like a bunch of American rappers in this video, which just comes across as more artificial than the song being played. Their constant \"tough guy\" mannerisms and attempts to appeal to the hip hop crowd make this video one of the dumbest marketing strategies ever devised and a part of me dies inside every time that I watch it.\n\nThen there's the worst of the bunch, Borders and Shading. This has to be the worst music video that I've ever seen in my life. It's just the car wash/wet T-shirt scene from the Touch of Red video since there were apparently a bunch of unused takes that video that didn't make the cut. It's truly pitiful since it's just another means of In Flames cashing in on their name rather than actually putting any effort into creating an actual music video. The Borders and Shading video is what truly epitomizes the entire album as a whole because of it\u2019s a half-assed production given to mindless fans that will swallow anything given to them just because it bears the In Flames name.\n\nSoundtrack To Your Escape isn\u2019t just the absolute worst album to have ever been made by In Flames, it\u2019s one of the worst albums that I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. If there's anything good to be said about it, it's that In Flames has never made an album this bad before or since.\n",
        "\nThis album has let me down, but honestly I should have expected it! Since I first read the titles of the songs I knew this wasn't going to be an improvement after Come Clarity. I've actually enjoyed EVERY release from In Flames, from the early days to before Come Clarity, when it got mediocre. I mean, I could actually LISTEN to Come Clarity and enjoy SOME of the songs. Not on this album, this album is an abomination.\n\nFrom beginning to end, this album does nothing for me. The opening, album-title track one of the two songs I can listen to, but it is NOT an enjoyable experience. The mediocre melodies and lack of the metal edge is not apparent at all in the next two tracks also, then the suckfest, skip worthy ridden track disaster begins.\n\nI wonder which member of the band snuck into Flyleaf's tour bus and stole the music for their next album? \"Alias\" reeks of pop-metal medley and mainstream modern rock. Repetitive and annoying riffs accompanied by synthesized whines doesn't stop there, \"I'm The Highway\" sneaks up on you and makes you think you're still waiting for \"Alias\" to end.\n\nJust wait till \"I'm The Highway\" is done, then you get the same thing AGAIN, and get ready for the emo vocal and musical punch in the face about 2 minutes in.\n\nI really can't tell a difference in any of the songs until \"The Chosen Pessimist\". The repetition of 4 guitar notes and dull drumming for the first 5 minutes of the song with some of Anders' whiniest moments is a horrible thing to sit through, then you get about a minute of continuous, boring chords, then back to the draggy notes. This goes on and varies little for 8 minutes. Possibly In Flames' worst recorded track.\n\nThe next 4 songs, nothing for me again. Not enough difference to care to type about them. Eraser was another mildly entertaining tune with some more catchier riffage, but still easily beaten by just about anything else on past albums.\n\nThis is a huge letdown for a long time fan of more than just the older stuff and I pray they change their direction next time.\n",
        "\nIf any of you had heard \"The Mirror's Truth\" EP before hearing this, you might have had the same reaction. It seems that In Flames had put their four best songs onto a CD and released it about a month in advance of \"A Sense of Purpose\" to give us hope of a good album, as opposed to the last two mediocre ones which, while they had their pop-band elements, were still enjoyable in places and made for a good listen. But this time it has gotten even worse.\n\n\nProps to Anders (vocals), who successfully manipulated me into buying the latest In Flames album with his EP trap. Why Anders, and not the rest of the band? Well, all of us who don't like what has happened to In Flames over time blame him - after all, HE'S the one with dreadlocks and whiney clean vocals, so who else could be to blame?\n\n\nThe Mirror's Truth, Tilt, Eraser, and Abnegation were all good songs with enjoyable elements and it really got me looking forward to \"A Sense Of Purpose\" - So I buy it, take it home, place it into my CD player, and begin listening to the album from the first track.\n\n\nEven though I'd heard it before, The Mirror's Truth was still enjoyable - nothing defiled about it so I was content listening to it all the way through again. \n\n\nDisconnected kicks in, and it starts off great. Fast paced, aggressive, and with that gothenburg element I enjoy in music. \"This album is going to be great!\" I thought. \"Aha, here's the chorus... what? Someone whiney must've gone into the wrong studio and started singing about how they felt like shit, all over In Flames' instrumental chorus!\"... Okay, I'll give up the charade. I can't decieve myself forever. Yes, that's Anders singing those dreadful lyrics and ruining a decent song. The guitar melody in the chorus is fantastic though, and definitely one to look out for if you decide to give the album a listen.\n\n\nThe next track \"Sleepless\" starts off well, one of those mid-paced memorable intro's. Now, some elements of this song remind me of the mighty Clayman era when In Flames had achieved the perfect balance between heavy and melodic, and this can be heard at 1:18 if you can ignore Anders enough to hear what is beneath him. Can't say much about the rest of the song though, the usual new In Flames formula of whining, recycled \"Soundtrack To Your Escape\" riffs, and weird pop synth which doesn't do the song any favours.\n\n\nI won't be doing a track-by-track analysis of the album, but it's important you know about the first few tracks as they stand out from the rest... I'll explain the rest shortly, but first a word on the second worst track on the album - Alias. Welllllllll the intro bursts into a weird plodding riff which sounds completely out of character for In Flames. I can't conjure the words to describe just how crap it is... There's lots of whining in it though so no doubt the song was all Anders' fault. Worse yet is that this intro riff is also the chorus. As for the rest of the song, it's all pretty boring. Except one part - when the guitars go clean, and back come the memories of Acoustic Medley, Pallar Anders Visa and the intro to Moonshield. It then proceeds to be repeated again with distorted guitars, in that lovely tone that was used for the chorus of Artifacts of The Black Rain. So why do I say this is the second worst song on the album if I enjoyed that part so much? Well, they couldn't have chosen a worse song to make it part of. It almost seems like an insult, in a \"we can still write great stuff, but we won't bother doing more than 40 seconds of it in a bad song\" kind of way. Like, the good stuff is there, but there's so much bad stuff that it destroys what little hope we're given of In Flames ever becoming the greatest Swedish band again.\n\n\nThe only abomination worse than this song on the album is The Chosen Pessimist. If you love to hear Anders whine, then this will be your new \"most played\" on Last FM. It's a whole song of Anders whining, on a whole new level of ridiculousness. He sounds out of tune and half asleep. The guitars are clean for the most part, and Anders even attempts some vocal harmonics, but they might as well have brought a cat into the studio as a guest vocalist. \n\n\nSo the rest of the songs are generally bad. There are a few good intro's but that's as far as it gets (Sober and Irrelevant, and March to The Shore). Wait, that's pretty close to \"March to The Store\"... a subliminal trick perhaps?\n\n\nSo why 47%? Well, HMV had a Japanese import in-store which I decided to pay an additional 5 pounds or so for, and it contains the additional 3 tracks from The Mirror's Truth EP that I mentioned at the start of the review. Combining these three tracks with the good song intro's and whichever good parts I pointed out, the album then becomes just under average for the kind of modern music it is.\n",
        "\nAs a follow up to the absolute masterpiece that was The Jester Race, Whoracle had quite a task to live up to. That album (as you will know if you've read my review) just struck something with me, and I never thought they'd be able to match it, and honestly Whoracle doesn't. But, it's still an absolutely amazing album. The guitar work of Jesper Str\u00f6mblad and Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m is still the focal point here, and they don't disappoint. Jotun alone contains enough timeless melodic guitar lines to satisfy me, but the whole album is packed with them.\n\nThe sound of the album is quite different to that of its predecessor. The sound is much clearer, and generally the songwriting has tightened up. The songs are fairly compact and distinct from each other, but unfortunately the production is just lacking that atmosphere that The Jester Race had. No doubt, some of the instruments (especially the acoustic guitars on Whoracle and Jester Script Transfigured) sound a lot better but the way it comes together just doesn't have that magic that The Jester Race did, but I wasn't expecting it to, so no matter.\n\nIf you're a fan of Dark Tranquillity, then this album is also definitely one you'll like, as there a few songs on Whoracle (most notably Worlds Within The Margin) as there are some moments which have that DT vibe going on. You could argue that since the two bands are closely linked and from the same scene, then they sound very similar anyway but I don't see it. Anyway, I digress.\n\nSince the guitar work is most definitely the instrument that takes the limelight in this type of music, the other instruments can often go quite underappreciated. However, unlike most In Flames albums, I found the drumming on a lot of Whoracle to be quite average. While there aren't any points where you notice any bad drumming, it seems to be drumming-by-numbers for the most part which is disappointing considering how good Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte's performance on The Jester Race was. That's not to say he doesn't have his moments, though. His drumming on Food For The Gods and the way it works with the bass and rhythm guitars is what makes that song so great and his simple tom work on the softer parts of the album sounds fantastic. \n\nThe most underappreciated instrument with In Flames though is undoubtedly the bass. While the bass parts aren't exactly outstanding from the guitar parts (ever), the sound of Johan Larsson's bass is really quite important to the sound of some of these riffs. A fine example would be Episode 666. The main riff is very much about the guitar, but without the bass it would not have nearly as much backbone as it does, and the power of that riff would be mostly lost. Note how that power is actually fairly absent from Everything Counts, a Depeche Mode cover, just because of a lesser bass presence. \n\nThat brings me onto the concept of the album. That's right, even a cover song is part of the concept of Whoracle, quite well placed as a sort of 'moral of the story' ending to the album. The album describes the life and crushing death of a society in a futuristic world. The concept was devised by vocalist Anders Frid\u00e9n, but the lyrics were in fact written by Dark Tranquillity guitarist Niklas Sundin. I've got to say, the lyrics on Whoracle are better than the lyrics Anders writes himself, with a very nice balance between the traditional In Flames imagery and a dark edge. Unfortunately, however, there are still quite a lot of awkward lines that detract from the poetic nature of the lyrics. The song with one of the most interesting ideas (Episode 666, in which an apocalyptic event is televised) is in fact written the worst, with such lines as \"Welcome here, the squirrel-wheel begins\". I have no idea what that's meant to mean either. Overall though, the lyrics are very good and quite interesting to read.\n\nWhat matters more than the lyrics, though, is how they're delivered and Anders does a solid job on this album. The first you hear of him on Jotun is in fact spoken word, and there's more of that on bits of the album, however it sounds poor. Sorry Anders, but you aren't John Haughm. It's not at all frequent enough to really care about though, as his growls on this album are strong. He can put the same kind of power into an immediate metal attack like Food For The Gods as well as he can into a slow-burner such as Gyroscope, and while I don't think his vocals here are the strongest he's done, they are certainly good enough.\n\nSo, even though I have pointed out a few flaws in Whoracle, they are all minor and the absolutely sublime guitar work on this album more than negates any problems the album could possibly have. While it doesn't quite compare to the perfect sound of The Jester Race, songs like Food For The Gods, Jotun and the beautiful Whoracle make this album an absolutely essential purchase.\n",
        "\nAll three of the songs on this demo feature on the Lunar Strain album, but I actually feel that these versions are actually better than their Lunar Strain counterparts. There's a very special atmosphere, especially around the opener In Flames and a lot of nice added things especially with acoustics. The acoustic intro to Clad In Shadows here is absolutely beautiful. \n\nThe guitar work of Jesper and Anders Iwers is top notch, with a couple of nice solos, and the vocals of Mikael Stanne (well, I'm not 100% sure but it definitely sounds like him) are very aggressive, better than the Lunar Strain performances. Despite the poor sound quality overall, the instruments can all actually be heard fairly well (though the cymbals are so undefined that I almost thought UneXpect were playing them) and so I can say that all of the members perform well, though there are a couple of timing issues on Upon An Oaken Throne and Clad In Shadows.\n\nEven though it will be near-impossible to get your hands on an original copy of this cassette (especially consider it has Jesper's phone number on it!), the tracks can be found the remastered edition of Lunar Strain, so they should be easy to get. Don't miss this one, it's an absolute gem.\n",
        "\nSoundtrack To Your Escape is not an easy album to review. On one hand, I'm very tempted to try and defend the band from some of the quite vehement criticism of this material (especially from users on this site), but I don't want to give it props where it isn't deserved. So...\n\nSoundtrack's certainly an interesting album to listen to, what you've got is a collection of songs that give off vastly different impressions. Opener F(r)iend begins with a sample that swells into an intense and dark metalcore riff, and quite frankly, it's fucking badass. The rest of the song doesn't quite match it, to be fair, but just the beginnings of these songs really show that In Flames have really been experimenting. You've got the aforementioned F(r)iend, poor nu metal riffs (Touch Of Red), quality melodic riffs (My Sweet Shadow) and even songs like Dead Alone, which sound a lot like a pop-punk band in the beginning. \n\nThe problem is, In Flames have always been a band with a set sound for each album, we had the pounding attack of Lunar Strain, the euphoric and soaring melodies of The Jester Race, so on so forth, but with this album and its predecessor Reroute To Remain, we have In Flames sort of flailing their hands around in the dark. While I admire their wish and lack of fear to experiment like this, they haven't really got anything solid to hold on to and make a quality album out of. As with Reroute To Remain, the memorability of the songs relies heavily on the chorus of each particular song, and honestly most of them succeed. Unfortunately quite a few of them do not really uphold the quality of the chorus, and only serve as a waiting period between those moments (this is especially evident on tracks such as Evil In A Closet). It's sad, but In Flames still know how to write an infectious melody, and if you give them the room most of these songs will find a way into your head at one point or another. \n\nNow, time for me to lose some credibility with all of those who hate this album. I'm tempted to give this album a considerably higher score just because it contains My Sweet Shadow, which is an absolute masterpiece of a song, and one of In Flames' best, at least since Colony. The buzzsaw guitar sound the guitarists adopted for the album is really implemented properly here, where in other places it just grates on your nerves. Every part has a place and it all just comes together to form another massive milestone in In Flames' history.\n\nAnders Friden is not the best vocalist in the world. Everybody knows that, but really I think the hate he receives from people is not deserved at all. His screams are perhaps something you need to get used to, but they work very well with the sound of the album, and his clean vocals have improved massively over time (just listen to him with Ceremonial Oath if you don't believe me). The texture of his voice is really quite unique and as always In Flames have done a good job of making the tones and sounds of the respective instruments work well together, even as they change over the years. \n\nSpeaking of change, the difference between the lyrics of this album and the words for songs like December Flower or Upon An Oaken Throne is just ridiculous. They are, quite honestly, pretty poor. There are a few pretty coherent songs but there's so many pathetic little lines that can actually just distract you from any merit the music behind them might earn. Just a few examples of these lines:\n\n\"Drown the monster, make all bad dreams go away\"\n\"I can be as angry as I want to be\"\n\"The I is lost in me\nBut I'm ready to give you\nThe m, it might even be the e\nAs I begin to search for I\"\n\nDeep stuff there, Anders. Generally though, the songs make sense, and while they're not all that original, they function perfectly well, it's just a shame when lines like those mentioned above become too audible to the listener and can't be ignored.\n\nJust as a note, as with all his In Flames albums, Daniel Svensson's drumming performances just keep getting better and better. He single-handedly makes songs like Dead Alone worth listening to. An excellent job from him, as always.\n\nSoundtrack To Your Escape is indeed an interesting album to listen to, as it seems to be a very mediocre album patched up in a fair few places with absolutely top quality music. It's all about whether or not those moments (the main riff of The Quiet Place) are frequent enough to outweigh all of the throwaway moments (the verses immediately afterwards). I'd say that they just about do, so if you didn't mind Reroute To Remain, I'd still give this one a try. However, it is still the worst In Flames album.\n",
        "\nIf you listen to classic In Flames records such as \u2018Colony\u2019 and \u2018The Jester Race\u2019, that helped define the melodic death metal genre, and then listen to more recent tracks like \u2018Scream\u2019 or \u2018F(r)iend\u2019, the considerable difference can often spark a negative reaction, and has done in In Flames\u2019 core fanbase for years now. But you know what? It doesn\u2019t matter, because \u2018A Sense Of Purpose\u2019 is a truly brilliant album, and any critics who are still having trouble getting over the band as they were in 2004 are simply missing out. Their last effort, 2006\u2019s \u2018Come Clarity\u2019, was far from poor either, but \u2018A Sense Of Purpose\u2019 is the album that In Flames have been threatening to make ever since that oh-so-controversial change in sound.\n\nSo, the sound of the album is an interesting one for In Flames fans, any review you read of this album will tell you that they\u2019ve filled the album with lead guitar and the classic harmonies that really set In Flames apart from any pretenders. No matter how hard anyone tries, the sound of Jesper Str\u00f6mblad and Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte is impossible to imitate, as the two have always (that is, since Bj\u00f6rn switched from drums to full time guitarist on \u2018Colony\u2019) gelled, and their understanding of harmony and their melodic awareness has remained intact since In Flames\u2019 inception in 1990. Sure, it wasn\u2019t that prominent in \u2018Reroute To Remain\u2019 or \u2018Soundtrack To Your Escape\u2019, but it was always there and since those albums it has really made a return and has become the most important part of In Flames\u2019 music once again.\n\nNot only that, but the clean vocals of Anders Frid\u00e9n have taken up Jesper\u2019s style of melodic composition, and really work as In Flames melodies. Anyone who has heard songs like \u2018Come Clarity\u2019 will be glad to hear that the clean vocals, while a lot more frequent, have actually improved massively. In fact, the vocals as a whole have gotten much better. Anders actually performs with real conviction and strength on \u2018A Sense Of Purpose\u2019, and has abandoned the whiny half-assed muttering that truly ruined a lot of songs on \u2018Soundtrack To Your Escape\u2019 especially. If you really miss his vocal style as shown with his work with fellow Gothenburg legends Dark Tranquillity, then you won\u2019t be relieved here, but hopefully if you listen to the album openly you will recognise that the vocals here are solid in their own right.\n\nThe drumming, as always, is top notch, with Daniel Svensson delivering yet another absolutely stellar performance, and even though his beats are not at all unique to each song, he performs with finesse and brings a lot of the songs to life. Accompanying him in the rhythm section is bassist Peter Iwers. Now, the bass guitar has never, ever been a particularly noticeable part of In Flames\u2019 sound, however Peter\u2019s thick bass tone compliments the multiple layers of guitars over it perfectly and really makes some of the album\u2019s riffs feel incredibly heavy.\n\nYou know, even though this new album could be considered a real mixture of their previous work, the sound of the album is very consistent and every single song is enjoyable and valuable: that\u2019s not something that I could say about an In Flames album since \u2018Whoracle\u2019.\n\nHonestly, the lyrics of \u2018Come Clarity\u2019 were pathetic. They were whiny, they were repetitive and they contained countless lines that just made you cringe. While I certainly can\u2019t say that the lyrics on \u2018A Sense Of Purpose\u2019 can be compared to the poetry of \u2018The Jester Race\u2019, there has been a dramatic improvement. The lyrics still seem to mostly deal with internal struggles and personal issues, however there is only one song on the entire album where the lyrics are so clich\u00e9 that it actually makes you stop and think what Anders was thinking whilst writing them (and all of their albums since \u2018Clayman\u2019 have had several such moments), and that\u2019s on \u2018Disconnected\u2019 (\u201cI feel like shit, but at least I feel something\u201d does not do it's anthemic chorus justice), and several of the chorus lines in particular have that quality that really have a lot of power even if you aren\u2019t immediately aware of what they mean, and that\u2019s something that Anders should really be proud of.\n\nIf you have truly hated every bit of music you\u2019ve heard from In Flames since \u2018Clayman\u2019, then I can\u2019t say that you will like this album, however if you think that \u2018Come Clarity\u2019 was a definite step in the right direction, then you will want to hear this. It\u2019s the album that defines In Flames\u2019 sound as the band that they are today. It\u2019s played with total conviction and it shows that the recording process was a very enjoyable one (and you know this if you\u2019ve watched their in-studio videos). It is, ultimately, just a fantastic In Flames album, boasting 12 songs of the highest quality that acknowledges the band\u2019s history, both distant and recent, and takes them into new places (the eight minute journey \u2018The Chosen Pessimist\u2019 is testament to that) that hopefully proves that In Flames have not lost their way.\n\nOriginally written for www.ultimate-guitar.com review team.\n",
        "\nA new album by our favorite sell outs In Flames.\n\nIn Flames is one of those bands that most people either love or hate nowadays. I myself have never hated them, although the change in style over the last 5 or 6 years hasn't been for the better. If Reroute to Remain was the first step down in the Nu metal/metalcore swamp, Soundtrack to your Escape was a full fucking face plant smack down in it and Come Clarity was trying to rise up but still being a bit soaked, then A Sense of Purpose is when the mucus is beginning to disappear. But only just beginning, not disappearing entirely.\n\nI have found something memorable in every In Flames record before this except for Come Clarity. Most people think it was a step forward, but it wasn't a step at all. This on the other hand is a step forward. Not a big one, but indeed a step nonetheless. The sound is pretty much the same as the last one, but in some way it catches my interest in a way Come Clarity couldn't. Maybe it's because it's a bit more guitar oriented or because the drumming is a bit more catchy. \n\nFor people who enjoyed the last couple of albums a lot, this is a real treat for them. It's simple, catchy and melodic. Good in a lot of peoples minds, but not in mine. It's just that little \"simple\" that holds it down. We can develop the word simple to repetitive. All songs sound pretty much the same. A nice intro, a fast, groovy and melodic verse and then a softer chorus, and then over and over again with very little variation in the riffs. The fast and groovy parts is just my taste, but the choruses with Anders clean singing isn't working. We all know Anders is worthless when it comes to singing clean. Hes screaming/growling isn't top notch either for that matter. And the lyrics are probably the worst they have ever done. I keep wondering what happened to the \"I wish I could rape the day\" spirit. Now it's just stupid whining and bitching. \nExample: \"I feel like shit, but at least I feel something\" or \"don't tell me, tell my ghost\". The latter one is just stupid. Anders used to have strong and violent emotions in his screaming, but now it just sounds sad and depressive. \n\nThe production is pretty solid, although the drums tend to drown the guitars sometimes. That's sad since the guitar work on this album is better than on the last two before this. The vocals seems pretty flat with very little depth, and that doesn't help Anders one bit.\n\nTo sum everything up:\nThis is by no means a bad record. The only weak song here is Alive which is completely horrible. But there isn't really any killer songs either. They're good, but nothing more. This record is quickly forgotten since nothing is memorable. Sure we might never get something as awesome as the solo in December Flower, but at least give me something like the intro to My Sweet Shadow or the chorus in Pinball Map. If you didn't hate the last 3 albums with all your heart, you should pick this up.\n\nOne final thing: The album art. WTF? It looks like Wolverine from X-men staring at a jagged cunt...\n",
        "\nI find it occasionally illuminating to describe an album by using its song-titles. After the limp dick beginning, this album starts to pick up its game near the end; but not nearly enough to preserve its credibility. Most of the songs moved through me without a sense of purpose; upon hearing them I was unmoved and unimpressed. It was like eating a bland soup with familiar ingredients and no meat. That being said, it wasn\u2019t all bad, but if you are familiar with In Flames, you will be more disappointed with this album than with Come Clarity, maybe even as disappointed as you were when they did Soundtrack To Your Escape. \n\nCompared to Come Clarity, this album is worse. Come Clarity was OK, but it had its weaknesses. A Sense of Purpose is like an extension of Come Clarity but with fewer strong points. Sober and Irrelevant is one of the strongest tracks and it\u2019s nothing special. Musically, everything sounds pretty similar to Come Clarity, their previous album. The guitars share a lot of those pummeling, sometimes catchy riffs, and they whip out the acoustics for a couple seconds every now and then. The vocals are slightly altered, but not noticeably so. At any rate, they\u2019re nothing to write home about. But compared to Come Clarity, A Sense of Purpose has more boring, skip-to-the-next-song sorta stuff. So the album is pretty much another Come Clarity, but blander. Why would you want that? Listen to The Jester Race, because that\u2019s metal. The songs on A Sense of Purpose are the kind of songs that get featured on Bam Margera\u2019s compilation CD. \n\nAND WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT ON THE COVER???\n\nCover art should reflect something about the music. In this case it\u2019s retarded, strange, terrible\u2026 it looks like the cover for some illustrated children's book but the artist was on meth. Great. You can almost tell what to expect from the music by looking at the cover. I like In Flames, but I hardly feel like I\u2019m betraying them here because I feel like they betrayed me when they shifted their target audience from metalheads to skatercunts. \n\nIn Flames peaked with Colony. They had their \u2018golden years\u2019 similar to porn, but they are now past their prime. Come Clarity was a small comeback from Soundtrack to Your Escape, but I think it\u2019s safe to say In Flames can throw in the towel any time now. They certainly should if this pattern continues. I still like them, I think, but I know I don\u2019t like their most recent output. \n\nThis album might leave you feeling a bit confused about what you just heard, don\u2019t try to convince yourself it was worth the money. What you\u2019re feeling is the empty edge of disappointment. You could almost say In Flames have lost their Sense of Purpose (probably not the first time someone's said that). \n\n50% isn't a fail, but your dad still might beat you if you got that on your report card. Unless you are retarded. Which you probably are if you like this album.\n",
        "\nOne thing was screaming at me when I saw the artwork for In Flames\u2019 \u201cA Sense of Purpose\u201d and \u201cThe Mirror\u2019s Truth\u201d due to the blatant lameness: Pok\u00e9mon! The awesome RPG focusing on battling and raising little monsters, you know? Well, I find \u201cThe Mirror\u2019s Truth\u201d to be much like a battle between a very powerful Pok\u00e9mon (an intelligent metalhead) facing a weak, pompous Pok\u00e9mon (In Flames\u2019 disgraceful effort) despite such difference in strength. Whether it\u2019s Japanese video games or history itself, you should never try to play a game you can\u2019t ever win, and In Flames have once again vomited forth another abomination in hopes of pleasing metal fans and their mainstream yuppies, yet not without secretly showing who matters the most. Let the battle begin!\n\nIn Flames used Gothenburg Roots!\nBut it failed\u2026miserably.\n\nTime and time again, In Flames is caught trying to recapture that melodic death remedy once found when the band could peacefully coexist with decency, but as usual, you can just expect failure. Jesper Str\u00f6mblad and Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte often times embrace riffs primarily injected with lethal amounts of melody, yet everything under that particular sun feels completely generic and recycled; you could honestly find better melodic tendencies in a Himsa b-side. Occasionally, there does come something appearing nice at first; however, seductive looks soon turn out disastrous for those striving at an extra view. The soloing show falls into this same category with bland formations and no texture whatsoever, but when riffs fail, leads soon will too. Good? Not in a million years. Agitating? Oh yea. As for Daniel Svensson\u2019s percussion, everyone can safely agree on his performance being this EP\u2019s finest quality, but that still isn\u2019t saying much about the overall aid. Although typically using double bass and consistent patterns, fills tend to be strictly limited by focus placed elsewhere; quite a shame, because he\u2019s the only one doing any right. \n\nIn Flames used Awful Vocalist!\nIntelligent Metalhead just got REALLY pissed!\n\nAnd of course, Anders Frid\u00e9n continues looking worse and worse with each studio effort, and \u201cThe Mirror\u2019s Truth\u201d might be his final nail in the vocal coffin. Now since In Flames acquired our squeaky friend, Anders\u2019 voice has lost all forms of aggression due to the occupation of whiny wails mostly found in nu-metal scenarios, which widely contradicts his glory days in Dark Tranquillity; that\u2019s essentially what he does here. His \u201cgrowls\u201d are faintly portrayed by lightly going low before crying like a confused boy wondering why his Nintendo 64 just crashed. No force, power, or might at all; just feeble pleas throughout. Thanks Anders for your grand display of emotional superiority, but I\u2019d rather have a basketball jammed up my urinary tract than listen to that pestering clash again. Jesus Christ Bananas! \n\nIntelligent Metalhead used Refusal of Purchase!\nIn Flames fainted\u2026and then exploded.\n\nWell isn\u2019t that a bitch? One hit did them plenty, and In Flames is officially buried in their own failed effort to successfully connect heavy metal and modernized feces. I have no will to fully experience \u201cA Sense of Purpose\u201d after witnessing this atrocity, because I know suicide would be my only way out of its burdens if \u201cThe Mirror\u2019s Truth\u201d has any familiar qualities; truly an offending mistake, and In Flames should somehow refund the fifteen minutes of individuals condemned to hear such junk. Words cannot describe how terrible our little EP is, so in the name of the almighty Arceus, pass along without regret.\n\nThis review was written for: www.leviatan-magazine.com\n",
        "\nThis is catchy, a lot like how Clayman is catchy, in fact I'd go as far to say that this is Clayman with a mix of Come Clarity. However, at the same time, this is also arguably In Flames' most melodic album to date. When it blasts and it gets all in your face, it does not do it anyway like how it is done in thrash or death metal, the style is closer to power metal, but it is not really power metal in the sense of speed metal mixed with dragons and thrash, but rather power metal in that the songs themselves carry the power of the album.\n\nIronically, the production, especially with how the bass and guitars are mixed, is probably the weakest as it has been on any In Flames' album. It is somewhat overproduced, and softened up a bit too much, there is not as much intensity to the guitar sound. Reroute to Remain had that palm-muting squeak that is heard in songs like Minus and Trigger, while STYE had an interesting reverberation that at least gave the guitars a good sound on that album and Come Clarity had an in your face death-metal style crunch. However, the songwriting is well done, unlike on those last three albums, and the hooks offered by the guitars with their harmonies, solos, and ...dare I say...riffs, are actually really really good. \n\nI do not think In Flames' was going for an intense album here. If anyone has followed the studio diaries back in October/November, you can see that they did not go into the studio with frowns on their faces. Often times, Daniel Svennson would crawl around naked (and the creature on the cover of this album reminds me of that in a way), making cat sounds and drinking stolen energy drinks, with the final episode showing him eating a roll of recording tape. This album seems to carry the lighthearted atmosphere of the recording process, and at the very least In Flames does that very well.\n\nThe lyrics are pretty much the same kind of subject matter that In Flames has been putting out these past few albums. How those lyrics are belted out have somewhat changed, however. Anders Friden briefly returns to using his old death vocals on the songs Disconnected and Drenched in Fear, and his main vocals are sort of a mix between clean singing and aggressive vocals, but there are hardly the whiny screams of Reroute to Remain, and absolutely no Elmer Fudds from that album either. Anders is not trying too hard to sound emotional, now it seems his voice has become natural to him. \n\nThis is not quite a return to form for In Flames, but it is a vast improvement over Come Clarity, and it is clearly their best since Clayman. I give this an 83/100.\n",
        "\nWell, we all know that In Flames had a lot of expectations to live up to with this album. In my opinion, they met said expectations, but without exceeding them in any way. After the greatness that is Come Clarity, I expected an absolutely flawless album, and A Sense of Purpose is not perfect. Sure, it offers some glimpses of perfection (A Sense of Perfection, if you will), but falls barely short.\n\nSo lets start off with the song-writing found on the album. Song-writing has always been In Flames strong point, and this album allows them to flex their muscles yet again. Every single track is brilliant, although one will quickly notice the lack of any complex song structures. The track \"Alias\" is sure to go down as one of their classic songs; look for it on any future greatest hits compilations. \n\nThe riffs on the album are as masterful as ever. Some of the riffs sound slightly rehashed, but it doesn't deter from the overall feel of the album. These guys make riff-writing look so easy. Take the track \"I'm The Highway\" for instance. It is full of multiple brilliant riffs without being a particularly exceptional track. These guys have perfect riffs to spare. The guitar solos are actually something of a weak point on the album however. They are, on the whole, best summed up by something my brother said: \"Wow, that solo sounds oddly technical and distasteful for an In Flames solo\". \n\nThe drumming is as interesting as ever. I'd even go as far as to compare the drumming to some of their older material. It brings back memories of great drum lines and fills as found in now-classic tracks like Clayman's \"Only For the Weak\". It is a shame that the drums are mixed so low on the album though. A mix more akin to an album like Hate Eternal - Fury & Flames would have been more appropriate, because the drumming here is interesting enough to warrant one's complete focus throughout the album on occasion.\n\nLike the recent EP, A Sense of Purpose isn't the greatest technical performance given by Anders. The album is laden with so many great vocal hooks that the poor performance rarely detracts heavily, however. Even weaker tracks like \"Delight and Angers\" has an amazing sing-along chorus. Frequent use of clean-harsh overdubbed vocals starts to sound stale byt he end of the album, but maybe it's better than listening to Anders try to squeeze out an uneffected vocal spectacle. Not all of his vocals are subpar though. His higher harsh register is still excellent (see \"Move Through Me\"). \n\nYet again, In Flames shows all the synth-abusing bands out there right now how to tastefully incorporate the instrument into an album. \"Sleepless Again\" and \"Move Through Me\" are both excellent examples of synth use that noticably adds to the song instead of being forced into the song-writing.\n\nOverall, this album has everything fans love about In Flames: the unstoppable riffs, the unqiue drumming, the sing-along vocal melodies and unique vocals, as well as the flawless addition of synth passages. Is the album completely groundbreaking for In Flames? No, but it is at least comparable to most of their past catalogue. The 8-minute power ballad \"The Chosen Pessimist\" really shows a growth in maturity as the band settles into its place atop the current metal world. Seriously, listen to \"Alias\" (and the whole album, for that matter) and you can easily tell how they got to where they are today.\n",
        "\nIn Flames has always been a very hit and miss band with me. In my opinion, Whoracle is one of the greatest death metal albums ever created, along with Death's Symbolic, Dark Tranquillity's The Gallery, and Suffocation's Pierced from Within. At the same time, I found Colony good but underwhelming compared to the work that came before it (and I can't get over the fact that Anders was rapping on Scorn), Reroute to Remain was In Flames jumping on the Nu Metal bandwagon right when it was about to die, and Soundtrack to Your Escape was one of the worst albums that I've ever heard in my life and I still shudder when I think about the Touch of Red video.\n\nThankfully, Come Clarity was a breath of fresh air, and even though the track order seemed disorganized, I truly enjoyed that album since I was capable of accepting that In Flames was never going to make another Whoracle and I was just happy that they were going to go back their death metal roots while at the same time progressing.\n\nThat brings us to 2008. Again, this isn't Whoracle Pt. 2, but I've grown accustomed to the fact that In Flames won't again even try to recreate such a great album. I will admit that I was put off by the first two tracks that I heard. The Mirror's Truth started out good but then it degenerated into Anders' clean vocals which had too strong of a contrast with the heavy sound early in the song. After that, I heard Disconnected and was happy to hear Anders bringing back the grunts that he used back on The Jester Race, but I couldn't get past Anders singing the lines, \"I feel like shit, but at least I feel something.\" It seemed like In Flames was selling out to the emo crowd and that In Flames was taking a step back after they just took a huge step forward. Then again, I\u2019m longing for the days when Anders sung about a \u201csquirrel wheel\u201d which doesn\u2019t come across as great poetry either. Thankfully, Jesper Stomblad isn't truly THAT stupid, having already turned In Flames into one of the most hated metal bands of all time. As a whole, this album sounds like a good - although very mainstream - progression from Come Clarity, with a good amount of Clayman\u2019s sound thrown in. It's nothing mind-blowing but it's still well done.\n\nThere is a lot to like here, whether it's the solo on Sleepless Again, the folkish acoustic passages that bring back memories of The Jester Race, or some of the chunkier Come Clarity-style riffs on Move Through Me, there is a lot for an In Flames fan to like, even if they sound a bit too accessible much of the time. \n\nOne big plus to this album is that Anders finally seems to have grasped the concept that he isn't a great vocalist before he got around to recording this album and while there are some truly horrible vocal parts, he actually sounds good for once and the listener is finally capable of actually listening to the vocals rather than trying to get past the vocals and listening to the guitars. I don't know exactly what happened in the course of two years, but I know that I like the results. This is especially apparent in the track The Chosen Pessimist. This track is exactly what the title track on Come Clarity tried to be. Sadly, Anders' voice cracks early on in the song, but he does sound better as the song goes on and it actually becomes one of the stronger songs on the album. (Note to Anders: learn what Pro Tools are so you aren't forced to use the least crappy take on an 8 minute song.)\n\nSo even with all that's actually good with this album, it does lose some points for not trying to bring any new ideas to the table, as well as being even more mainstream than Reroute To Remain. That being said, I wasn't expecting this album to be anywhere near as good as it is. I was planning to rip on this album extremely hard after hearing the first two tracks, but this is far batter than I expected it to be and is accessible enough to be the best starting point for somebody new to In Flames.\n",
        "\nDescribing something that is perfect is much more difficult than you would think. The word \u2018perfect\u2019 itself has become largely overused today, however it\u2019s one of the only words that comes to mind when I think about In Flames\u2019 utter masterpiece which is The Jester Race. Never before have I become so entirely attached to an album. \n\nA stunning acoustic harmony is what you will first hear when you begin to listen to this album. Moonshield is the best introductory song imaginable. The acoustic intro is actually mesmerizing and surreal and when the heavy riff hits in at 49 seconds you still haven\u2019t woken up from this dreamland. Stormblad is truly a musical genius and why he doesn\u2019t write melodies like this anymore is completely beyond me. What else is beyond me is the fact that this song has become a rarity at their live shows. When the music fades on Moonshield, we get some more beauty from The Jester\u2019s Dance which serves as a great instrumental interlude between the opener and Artifacts Of The Black Rain. It is at this point in which the album picks up speed. The tight guitar riffs and fast paced vocals make this track a headbanging highlight. They also made a music video for this track, but that\u2019s nothing special. The Jester Race flawlessly combines harmonies and beautiful melodies (the title track) with crushing anger and aggression (December Flower, Dead God In Me).\n\nIn the album sleeve it states that Jesper Stormblad wrote the majority of the music on this album and I believe that he still writes most of In Flames\u2019 music today but I can\u2019t understand why it was so much more inventive and stunning back in the day. Anders Friden belches out one of the best vocal performances he\u2019s ever done. Each lyric drips with despair and anger as he screams them out. Although I think Colony calims the best vocals from Friden, I think The Jester Race is the most emotional. The drums are excellent as always and were performed by Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte, who is now a guitarist in the band along with Stormblad. The lyrics may be the best the band has to offer, mostly incorporating themes of depression and human weakness.\n\nThe Jester Race is a journey of an album not to be missed. It is considered by many to be In Flames\u2019 masterpiece, and I think I might agree with that. The music is truly timeless and can be listened to over and over again. If you appreciate creative music in general, you better look into this album, as it helped develop the genre of what is now known as classic melodic death metal.\n",
        "\nWell what have we here? Did I accidentally download {insert random nu/metalcore band here}\u2019s album?? That was the first thought that popped into my head upon listening to this the first time. In all seriousness, it might not be that bad, but this isn\u2019t good at all. I wasn\u2019t really expecting much in the first place when after In Flames recent releases, but Come Clarity had been a very slight improvement and I was hoping there was some slight chance I could find something similar to Whoracle-era In Flames\u2026 even if it was something small or tiny\u2026 anything! But alas, this is pretty much like Come Clarity Part II, with Anders Friden still sounding like a nu metal singer or terrible Christian metalcore singer, especially with those faggy clean vocal parts, I mean seriously, what happened to the godly vox I remember singing along to during Artifacts of the Black Rain or Jotun?? Instead it\u2019s back to almost whiny sounding wails. \n\nMoving off that, there are some highlights presented with this album. The guitars are melodic in nature but not presenting any good riffs really, or much to be in awe with lead guitar-wise. The drums are really good, compared to the last several releases with good showing on the title song even having a semi-headbangable riff, but then Anders chimes in \u2013 at least on this song the chorus is worthy of singing along to if I had to choose a good part there. The song Eraser has some weird pop-synth thingy going on at the beginning that shouldn\u2019t belong on an In Flames album, or melodeath album; I don\u2019t think even Dark Tranquillity would put that in, but otherwise seems to have a decent attempt at vocals and good drumming. The last two songs are complete and utter boarshit, yes boarshit. It\u2019s sunk that low. \n\nThis EP is not a good sign for the upcoming album, I\u2019ve been holding onto the hope that I had that maybe In Flames could pull off a stunning comeback album but if it will ever happen it certainly won\u2019t be with this next release. Honestly I might have to give up on these guys for good, I will check out the new album only to see if there is by chance a complete turn around, then of course I\u2019ll be disappointed as usual but that\u2019s how it works. This deserves some credit with some improvements on drums and guitar melodies but overall this doesn\u2019t cut it.\n",
        "\nIn Flames is one of the most well-known metal bands out right now, and that is largely in part due to their recent efforts. The newer In Flames albums have tainted their image and made a once-legendary melodic death metal band be labeled as a band that has sold out. One of the biggest gripes about the new sound of In Flames is that the solos and melodies that made them famous have disappeared, and they have been replaced by generic metalcore and nu metal riffs.\n\nWell, I'm happy to say that the melodies and solos are back, for the most part. \n\nThere are still some generic riffs to be found in the songs on this EP, but there are also solos that remind you of In Flames' Clayman and Colony days. The solos on this EP are the best solos they have written in almost ten years. The melodies used on this EP are also very good, and they are also the best melodies the band has written in about ten years.\n\nThe first song on the EP, The Mirror's Truth, opens up with what is probably the best riff to be found on this four-track CD, and a very, VERY nice solo is found near the beginning. The lyrics are pretty catchy for the most part, but why Anders would write something like \"We're not even trying\" into the chorus is completely beyond me. Fast double bass is heard throughout the song and it's good for the most part.\n\nThe next two songs, Eraser and Tilt, are okay and both feature solos. However, there are some really boring riffs on both of these songs and that's really disappointing. However, the passage in Eraser where Anders uses a death growl during the chorus partly makes up for it.\n\nThe last song, Abnegation, was released on Viva La Bands and it was not very good at all. However, this version is much better. Everything about it is improved, and the chorus is changed slightly. I can't stretch how much of an improvement over the original version this track is, you'll just have to hear it yourself.\n\nTo summarize,I was pretty pleased with this EP. In Flames is playing real guitar solos again and they sound very good. The riffs could use some work, and some of the lyrics are dumb.\n\nAll in all, I'm looking forward to A Sense of Purpose and I hope it's as good as this EP is.\n\nCheers.\n",
        "\nIn Flames, the infamous gothenburg band. I started listening to them about 5 years ago at the pinnacle of my angst ridden youth, and unfortunately I have to credit them for introducing me to metal. With that said, let's get to the fucking point here: Their new EP is a long way from melodic death metal and is essentially a hard rock album drenched in Gothenburg soup.\n\nThe album sounds like a slightly less technical version of the second half of Come Clarity injected with a shit-ton of melody (yes, even more). There was something about CC that made me cringe while i was listening to it, something about the way the vocals rode the riffs for the longest time possible until you wanted to scrape your fucking ears off because anders wouldn't stop shoving his dick in them. This album still does that, but it's not quite as painful (yet). The version of abnegation on this EP is WAY FUCKING BETTER than the other one, but it still isn't quality metal. We all know In Flames will never be as good as they once were, (which wasn't something to aspire to, but rather something from which they could have built off of) but for some reason i keep coming back to see what they're churning out. However, There is one thing about this EP that does feel right, and that is the flow throughout the songs. There is more consistency vocally because Anders is far more melodic, and the album as a whole seems to grate on your ears less. But let's get down to specifics. \n\nAs for Anders Friden, who the fuck is this guy kidding, his vocals are all raspy melody and there are no balls left on this man's body. His harsh vocals are just weak and sound WAY too forced, like he's trying to get people to think he's extreme and badass, yet still appeal to the emo crowd. Lyrically this man just fails. He'll have a catchy sentence here or there but overall the metaphors run into each other and come out all jumbled and fail to accomplish much of anything coherent or meaningful that hasn't been said a thousand times before in a much better way. There are some new elements vocally that make it sound like someone else is doing backing vocals on Abnegation when he says \"I clench you\" (whatever that means). There is also a similar effect on Tilt. The harsh vocals are just empty of conviction and full of what should be pain, misery, or despair but just sound emo as shit because he trails off each phrase with a half-whine \"euhhh\" that makes him sound absolutely retarded. When he's not doing his halfscream-halfyell singing he's trying to growl like Bjorn Strid (why anyone would aspire to sound like this i have no fucking clue) and he's failing at that. Overall the vocal experience is sometimes pleasurable as Anders at least manages to make things catchy while being a giant twat and mucking up everything else.\n\nWhen the turd behind the microphone shuts up this becomes more enjoyable, albeit very immature sounding. Yet ALWAYS the riffs are partially obscured by electronics that add next to nothing and vocals that DETER from the sound. The riffs sound hard-rock inspired all over the place and never really go anywhere brutal or mesmerizing, only performing the most detestable Maiden worship. There are parts of Tilt and Eraser that sound ALMOST like the band that wrote Colony, but they are few and far between and quickly become consumed by whiny Underoath inspired vocals. The quiet part of Abnegation is totally pointless and every little thing they churn out to try to change the pace of their songs just goes nowhere and ends up bringing back the chorus (with more intensity?). The riffing on Eraser is pretty solid i guess for an in flames song, and then at 2 minutes in there is a 25 second solo where ANDERS KEEPS HIS MOUTH SHUT and it is pretty sweet, but also slow, uninspiring, and largely unimpressive by solo standards. From 2:25 to 2:43 on Tilt they do almost the same thing. On this track Anders actually shuts up near the end too, which is nice. The thing about the leads is that they just make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, which isn't entirely what i want my metal to do, but it's like kicking a puppy for pissing on your rug (although in this case it's more like a 17 yr old arthritic poodle who should be put down). \n\nThere is much less bass in the production than on CC, but I can't really hear it, never really could, and don't really give a shit. In Flames have never been known for their drumming or their bass work. The drums seem to be fairly competent, maybe better than they used to be, but not exactly very beneficial to the music either. The band seems to be content with letting Anders lead the way at the forefront of the production, which is a sad, sad decision as far as I'm concerned. \n\nGOOD METAL THIS IS NOT\n\nHighlights - If i had to pick, I'd go with Eraser\n",
        "\nSo, this EP/single comes as a pre-album tease for us diehard In Flames fans, and I think it served it's purpose quite nicely indeed.\n\nNow, the thing about In Flames is that they cannot afford to turn out another album that sounds similar to ANY of their past works if they want to regain the respect of metal fans everywhere. This EP proves that they can live up to these expectations that I (and many others) have for them.\n\nSo let's analyze the music on this EP then. The guitar work throughout, I find, sounds like a great mix of In Flames' new and old eras. There's definitely a reason that In Flames is one of the biggest metal bands in the world today, and their masterful creation of melodic riffs is definitely a contender for the reason of said popularity. Looking around, I've seen people comparing the riffs (especially on the track \"Tilt\") to The Jester Race-era In Flames, which definitely isn't a bad thing at all.\n\nThe drumming is absolutely phenomenal and has evolved slightly from their past efforts. It has just the right mix of death metal technicallity and metalcore catchiness. Let's just say that people whose ears gravitate towards the drumming in a song will not be disappointed in the least,\n\nNow, Anders is the only reason I didn't just give the EP 100%, His vocals are as catchy as ever, but his harsh isn't quite harsh anymore, and the constant layering of his pseudo-harsh and clean vocals gets kind of messy at times. Still, it shows that fans of Come Clarity will still be digging the vocals on this album, which is obviously important for mainstream success. The strong clean vocals in both \"Tilt\" and \"Abnegation\" are very promising, giving off a very Bjorn Strid (Soilwork) type of vibe. The chorus on \"Abnegation\" is definitely one of their strongest in a while. Also, I appreciated the lack of the soft, brooding vocals present on past songs like \"My Sweet Shadow\". I don't know, maybe some people really like that from Anders, but it sounded like a speed-bump to me.\n\nOverall, this EP gives new hope that \"A Sense Of Purpose\" is going to be absolutely crushing. It seems like In Flames is writing tracks that are appealing to both old and new fans of the band, leading one to believe that \"A Sense Of Purpose\" will be just the fresh offering that In Flames fans everywhere are craving.\n\nI, for one, can't wait!\n",
        "\nFor those of you who loved the old school melodic death metal days of the early 90s with great bands such as Dark Tranquillity and In Flames at their peaks, if you haven\u2019t already checked out this little EP, you really have to. This is much more than your average EP, it\u2019s a transition from The Jester Race to Whoracle, which is widely considered their finest era. Also, if you can\u2019t find this EP, it is included in the re-release of The Jester Race, which is much easier to come by.\n\nOn with the music! Goliaths Disarm Their Davids is what opens up Black Ash Inheritance. This track sounds a lot like something off of Whoracle and therefore, amazing. It is an excellent example of where the Gothenburg melodeth scene was at this point. The guitars are what make this song. No fast riffage, only beautiful soaring, melodic melodies. The vocals sound like they did on The Jester Race but the production is better so they are completely audible. Also, the very catchy chorus will have you reading along with the lyrics. Gyroscope is a teaser as it would later appear on the Whoracle album. Needless to say, this is a highlight of Whoracle and thus is essential here as well. The opening melody is reminiscent of In Flames\u2019 folk influences most present of their 1994 EP Subterranean. This is followed by crushing riffs and solos which we have grown to love in old In Flames albums. Te chorus also features the first clean vocals (kind of) that In Flames used but of course sounds nothing at all like the singing on several most recent albums. After this we get a beautiful acoustic interlude (appropriately titles Acoustic Medley) from Jesper Stormblad before we are ear-fucked by the raw live track of Behind Space. Of course, this song is not only a highlight of In Flames\u2019 debut, Lunar Strain, but is also one of their best songs. The production is great and Anders\u2019 vocals tear through your speakers with shrieks that he certainly hasn\u2019t done in recent years.\n\nIn conclusion, Black Ash Inheritance is for anyone who is interested in the Swedish melodic death metal scene. Hell, it\u2019s worth your money for the first song alone.\n",
        "\nIn Flames were the first metal band I got into, and my first album by them was actually The Tokyo Showdown, the live album with pathetic sound quality but a fantastic setlist. Obviously since then I'm familiarised myself with all of their other material, yet I realised not long ago that I didn't actually own copies of Reroute To Remain or Soundtrack To Your Escape, the two albums that are constantly attacked for being 'mallcore', and other such insults to In Flames. Obviously I'd heard a good amount of songs from the two but now that I have the full album, I have to say it is not nearly as bad as everyone seems to think.\n\nThe first thing that will jump out at you when you pop this CD in is that there is a much heavier use of synthesiser and clean vocals in a lot of songs. I mean, In Flames have used keyboards since the very beginning, so I find it quite odd that people are complaining about this element. A vast majority of the keyboard use in this album is for soundscaping and atmospherics, rather than as a real key component of a song (which it has been in the past, remember 'Wayfaerer'?) and I find that it is used very effectively. Aside from a few intros and quieter sections, they are not massively noticable and listening to the whole album I never thought that they were emphasised too much or just not beneficial to the sound. \n\nAs for the vocals, I've never been a huge fan but I find no major problems with either Anders' clean vocals or his new style of screaming. The production of them in the studio is where the problem lies, they are very muffled and occasionally distorted and I think this is mostly down to the fact that Anders does not have a particularly strong voice. Sure, sometimes they're annoying but it's not difficult to ignore them. I think a lot of the best moments on the album are the choruses, where the clean vocals are almost always implemented. \n\nThat said, don't think there is no melody in the guitars. There always has been oodles of melody and harmony dripping from In Flames' guitars, and this album is no different. The only real difference is that a lot of the guitar parts are very rhythmic at the same time, rather than the previous formula where a lot of the time the guitars would be divided between one player playing the melody and another playing chords to provide backing. The riffs here are still incredibly melodic and the classic style of harmonies In Flames are known for is still there, but the addition of more rhythmic hooks (which are only used by sellout bands, obviously) spices up In Flames' sound. \n\nI think that Daniel Svensson's drumming has improved with every In Flames album he's appeared on and with Reroute To Remain he's really brought some songs to life. While if you are listening casually, you will start to hear similar beats throughout, his performance is fantastic and some of his fills show his fantastic ear for what will fit with any particular piece of music. However, his bass drum is not nearly prominent enough, and this in turn plays down Peter Iwers' power on the record. His playing has never been at all noticable in any way behind his bandmates' thick guitar tone, which is sad. However, this problem is to be found in every In Flames recording, so it is no real reason to mark down Reroute To Remain.\n\nThe other main point of interest on the album is some of the more laid back tracks, such as 'Metaphor' and 'Dawn Of A New Day'. I think both of these are very interesting tracks which break a lot of new ground for In Flames, including some of the more 'classic' acoustic elements of mid 90's In Flames. I hope to hear more music like this from them in the future.\n\nI find it quite odd that this is considered In Flames' 'sellout' album, because if you really believe they did sell out, Clayman is quite a similar album. I mean, a lot of songs on the album could fit right in on Clayman, and (to an extent) vice versa. All taken into consideration though, I think this is a good album. Not great, like The Jester Race or Colony, but certainly much, much better than what it is generally considered to be. It has a couple of stinkers (such as 'Cloud Connected' and 'Transparent') but songs like 'Trigger', 'Dawn Of A New Day' and the opening title track make Reroute To Remain an enjoyable album, worthy of the In Flames name.\n",
        "\nWith In Flames\u2019 ninth full length album approaching in April it really makes you look back on the career that this band has had. They sure have changed their sound to many people\u2019s dismay but the point is, they are still making music after nearly twenty years of their existence. I think that says something by itself.\n\nI find Clayman to be a really interesting release. It seems to prove as a sort of transition to the drastic style-change from Colony to Reroute to Remain, and frankly, I think it works really well. It has all the trademark aspects of older In Flames albums with the inclusion of more clean vocals, which at some point, appear on almost all of the tracks and also more catchy hooks with the help of a synthesizer (Only for the Weak). The clean vocals sound the best on this album in my opinion. They seem less whiney than on later releases and are usually spoken rather than sung (Suburban Me). The harsh vocals sound great too with sort of a jump towards the higher pitched sound of later In Flames albums, although I still think Colony showcased the greatest vocals Anders Friden has come to offer. The duel guitar work on this album is as good as you would expect judging from past releases, in other words, quite mind blowing.\n\nOpener Bullet Ride is a fun tempo changing track with an awesome chorus followed up by the live staple Pinball Map, which actually might have served as a better opening track. Only for the Weak incorporates a heavily synthesized sound but a very enjoyable headbanger if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. If not, you probably stopped listening to this band in 2002.\n\nClayman is a very different sounding In Flames release and a really interesting and creative take on melodeth. Where does it fit amongst their best albums? I don\u2019t know, and who cares. It doesn\u2019t sound much like The Jester Race or Whoracle, and if it did, we would probably be bored of them by now. All I can say is that it is a welcome addition to their collection in my books.\n",
        "\nWell, this album was quite possibly the best album In Flames has released in recent years. Simple, yet beautiful in it's own right. \n\nAlthough Take this Life and Leeches are rather poor, featuring Overly-heavy riffs and boring solos, the rest of the album is quite enjoyable. Lisa Miskovsky's vocals on 'Dead End' were truly brilliant and made the song what it is. Anders Frid\u00e9n has continued with his sung choruses, which add a unique aura to the album. \n\nThe riffs are goodand catchy, and the acoustic sections in 'Come Clarity' are a nice change from the pounding riffs of the rest of the album. However, 'Scream' is possibly the most insulting piece of work the band has ever done. It is basically a thrash song with the odd melodic part thrown in here and there. Also, it's terribly repetitve. There's almost no variation in the riffs, and you need a high-quality sound system to hear any melody at all. That said, 'Crawl Through Knives' is the best song on the album, no question. A nice return to their old sound, but still keeping the new flare. Pounding riffs, melodic bridges, heavy choruses. Epic, simply epic.\n\nThe album is a good mix between old and new, which is something more and more bands are doing nowadays. Most crash and burn, but In Flames has done it very well. The lyrics are relevant and meaningful, and Anders' vocals really do bring them to life. All in all, a good album, well worth buying!\n",
        "\nSoundtrack To Your Escape. The name has inspired many to sarcastically refer to it as \"The Soundtrack To Escape From\". Justified? Not in my opinion.\n\nThis album is a huge disappointment for many longtime In Flames fans. Many have complained that the guitars are not as melodic as they are on such classic masterpieces as Whoracle or Lunar Strain. But this, in my opinion, is made up for by the heavy use of synths. I'm know that many people \"hardcore metal fans\" considers synth-using a sin, but I really enjoy it. Oh well onto the review.\n\nThe opening of the first track, F(r)iend, is very surpring (as is the song title). All other In Flames albums have either started with a slow melodic intro (i.e. Reroute to Remain and Subterranean) or a heavy, fast kick in the face (i.e. Clayman and Lunar Strain). This one starts off with a whisped from distorted female voice. This leaves you stunned and not quite ready for when the kick hits your eardrums. When you have recovered from the shock you can hear a blur of heavy guitars and screamed vocals by Anders. This album is according to me Anders strongest performance in In Flames. He mixes the harsh and the clean vocals really well (unlike the quite boring vocals, ordinary-sounding vocals of the previous album, Reroute to Remain). The guitars on the other hand are far from as good as they have been but this, as previously stated, is not a very big problem due to the fact that the synths compliment the guitars, which upon casual listening could make it seem like there isn't much missing. While I do prefer the \"old In Flames\" (i am obsessed with Lunar Strain, Subterranean and The Jester Race right now) this is also very good.\nAnd now for the drums; Daniel is a good, if quite standard-sounding drummer. This may be one of his best performances. The only thing wrong with the drums on this album is the sound of them. The producer can't have focused much on the drums, just adding some random effect which makes them sound like Daniel was hitting his hands against various tables and chairs instead of drums, because he was too busy taking care of the vocals and the synths.\n\nThe second song on the album, The Quiet Place, was released as lead single from the album. The song starts of with an extreme attack of synths which will chase a lot of metal heads out of the city it's being played in but if your willpower is strong enough to stay in the room until the intro ends you will find a very good song. The vocals during the verses reminds me a bit of Jonathan Davies (which is at all that bad in my opinion) but not too much. The chorus is nice and screamy. Dead Alone is pretty much the same, but faster and with more harsh vocals. The vocals during the chorus are pretty confusing with Anders varying between screaming and hypnotic effect-laden clean vocals.\n\nSong number six My Sweet Shadow seems to be the most generally accepted song on this album. This is due to the almost-classic-In-Flmas-sounding riff in the beginning. About 40-45 seconds in the song calms down and Anders is front and center with some synths behind him. Then comes the chorus which, with a little modification could easily fit on Whoracle. Then another verse, then another chorus, then a bridge, then another chorus. Many people consider this song structure, which applies to almost the whole album, as something bad. I personally dont care in the slightest how the songs i listen to are built up but i guess thats up to each person to decide what they think. Another point of usual complains is the lack of solos. There are a few of them but they generally dont last more than a few seconds. Again, this is not a problem for me; if a song is good a solo wont make it better, if a song is bad a solo wont make it better. My Sweet Shadow ends with a synth playing a repetative melody for about a minute which works very well when they play it live as the last song but in the middle of an album it just gets boring.\n\nThe next song Evil In a Closet is the album's \"ballad\". Next comes In Search For I, which rivals F(r)iend in heaviness. After that headbang-fest comes the midpaced, made-to-be-uncomfortable-sounding Borders And Shading with its disturbing, bizarre lyrics.\nThe last song, Bottled, is a VERY inappropriate way to end an album. It just ends leaving you to feel like there should be another track after that. Which on some versions there is; the bonus track Discover Me Like Emptiness is a much better last track than Bottled in every way. It is a bit slower (though not a ballad) which I really like album-enders to be and also a bit emotional (which Bottled definitely was not. It's pretty much just boring).\n",
        "\nBefore the release of their recent disc-shaped faeces (Read: everything after \"Clayman\"), before the times of Maiden-goes-accessible-and-harsh (\"Colony\") and even before the lacklustre charm of \"Whoracle\", In Flames released recognizable classic upon the unsuspecting crowd of Sweden's most recognizable rainy town.\n\nThis is great old Gothenburg: a healthy mixture of death metal\u2019s fast drumming, tremolo riffing and harsh vocals with power metal\u2019s melodic elements, acoustic breaks and occasional clean vocals. We are talking about the years when the so called \u201cGothenburg scene\u201d was still strong, fresh and unique. Much like the thrash boom in the 80\u2019s, this was a time when young musicians were yearning to show every metalhead their youthful creativity, energy and their strong musicianship, and thus, a new and still controversial metal genre was born. As of 1996, landmark albums such as Dark Tranquillity\u2019s \"The Gallery\" and At The Gates\u2019 \"The Red in the Sky Is Ours\" have already been released, so it was time for Jesper Stromblad\u2019s crew to step up their game and write another hard-hitter after the acclaimed \"Lunar Strain\". The chance was theirs to write a follow up to the marvel that was \"Subterranean\", that had the sole defect of being too short. Did they pull it off? Well, obviously no, silly. But hey, at least there was a distinguishable ATTEMPT made, and when you consider how fast and how far this group would soon fall, you can count that as a compliment.\n\nSongs here range from somewhat campy (albeit catchy) growl-along power metal esque tracks (\"Artifacts of the Black Rain\") to stronger, faster and more visceral heavy rockers (\"Dead Eternity\") to create a varied and interesting experience. Acoustics are used with welcome sobriety, riffing is akin to power metal with the occasional tremolo racket to emphasize the aggression or sometimes the melodic theme of the songs, and the clean vocals are, fortunately, used sparingly. Why? Well, let's get that out of the way, then.\n\nThe most underwhelming performance stems from Friden\u2019s vocals. While still retaining a small trace of his unhinged persona from \u201cSkydancer\u201d, this album\u2019s slower and more focused nature allows Anders little space to dwell on ferocity alone as he struggles not only with diction issues, but also with interpretative ones. Having proved later on to be able to sing in different voices and tones (whether these are any good, however, is up to you) and perform a modicum of competent multitracking, his decision to carry this whole album in a boring, hoarse and never-changing rasp is strange at best and catastrophic at worst. To sing about Greek gods (\u201cLord Hypnos\u201d), age-old earth deities (\u201cArtifacts of the Black Rain\u201d) and vivid, disturbing recollections of molestation (\u201cDead God in Me\u201d) with the same monotone succeeds only in making me nervous, like watching Keanu Reeves sleepwalking through an amazingly written script.\n\nTo state that the Zeitgeist is the sole responsible party for such a dry performance is only half right. It is safe to assume that by that time, most death metal vocalists didn\u2019t really give a shit about fruity clean singer stuff like interpretation, diction and intonation. However, Friden\u2019s closest contemporaries Stanne and Lindberg were already seeking ways to evolve just by trying a little bit more. Fresh from a screeching performance in \u201cLunar Strain\u201d, the former landed on Dark Tranquillity\u2019s \u201cThe Gallery\u201d with equal craziness but absolutely adapted to that album\u2019s pace and identity, while the latter quickly realized it could be possible to sound maniacally Swedish AND understandable at the same time, thus giving a less agonizing performance in commercial landmark \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d than he did on ATG\u2019s previous, more accomplished works.\n\nHis finesse for writing lyrics used to be, however, surprisingly brilliant. Yes, his nonsensical warbling on \"Whoracle\" and his most recent alternative musings are far away from this album\u2019s greatness, which is the closest In Flames ever got to emulating Arcturus' or Dark Tranquillity's penchant for abstract, over-the-top poetry. It comes as no surprise that Niklas Sundin helped him with the concepts, resulting in a really praiseworthy job, proving that Frid has (or had) a great talent with words, but unfortunately, that\u2019s about it.\n\nThe Jester Race\u2019s coolest assets are, as per expectations, Jesper\u2019s and Glenn\u2019s great guitar skills. The duet craft very nice leads and melodies through the album and accentuates them with tight and solid (although not overly technical) riffing. Soloing in here are also hits the spot, ranging from infectious and catchy power metal worship (\"December Flower\"; played by DT's Fredrik Johansson) to more melancholic and brooding pieces (\"Dead God in Me\"). Johann\u2019s bass is somewhat hard to distinguish from the album\u2019s thick guitar tone, which is sad, because his basslines on \"Subterranean\" were very nice and audible. Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s drumming is standard (for metal) and fails to impress or to stand out, unfortunately, although his taste for jumpy beats gets some spotlight in \"Dead Eternity\".\n\nWell, every track here is very solid and diverse, some of them plod a little bit, but then they are saved by a powerful break (\"Graveland\", \"Dead God in Me\"). Others feature brief but very catchy guitar leads (\"Artifacts\", \"Lord Hypnos\") and cool acoustic breaks (\"Lord Hypnos\" again), but there is one song that I wish to highlight, that is one of In Flames\u2019 most recognizable and beautiful compositions, the marvellous \u201cMoonshield\u201d. God, if this wasn't written in the \"Subterranean\" sessions, I'm changing my name to Jeff Goldblum. Soothing and incredibly well-written acoustic and electric folk melodies, melancholic lyrics, well-paced drumming, and even Anders\u2019 screams sound fitting here. Yes, it\u2019s that good. A genuine killer that shows the great capacity for creating atmospheres these guys had, only to later squander the whole lot of it penning insurmountable crap like \u201cThe Quiet Place\u201d. Give me a break.\n\nYes, this is In Flames at the top of their game. An amazing mix between melody and aggressiveness, clean and harsh, light and heavy. I really miss the time when those guys knew how to do it right, because after this album, they only managed to screw things up, getting progressively worse and worse until their mallcore years, when they just pissed in their whole legacy. Sad, really sad.\n\nThis album's way too standard drumming and relentlessly morose vocals drag it down a bit, but not enough to take away its obvious merits. If you\u2019re not a narrow-minded black/death elitist, you should check this out for its powerful melodies, thrilling lyrical content and the overall fun this release provides, you won\u2019t regret it. There was a time when In Flames ruled, but most of us just don\u2019t remember it. Well, neither does them, I suppose.\n",
        "\n(Edited)\n\nBy the year 1997, In Flames had released two great albums (The Subterranean EP being the best thing they've ever done), ranging from the overall rawness of \"Lunar Strain\" to the polished and more melody-based \"The Jester Race\" and established themselves as one of the quintessential bands of the famed Gothenburg scene. I happen to like In Flames a lot because of those two albums (and the EP), but hell, \"Whoracle\" is really overrated.\n\n\"The Jester Race\" was the album that laid the blueprint for the subgenre, not this. This is a worsened, more streamlined and dumbed down version of the aforementioned classic. Every element of TJR is here, but watered down and made uninteresting by the songwriting flaws. \"Whoracle\" is just a bloody repetitive album on which the musicians involved think they can write songs that revolves around ONE idea/motif that gets played over and over again and get away with it. And guess what, they DID get away with it, because this album is considered a Gothenburg classic. What a joke.\n\nWhen it comes to this band's bad albums right before their recent mallcore atrocities, some long-time fans seem to simply forget about this one and point \"Colony\" (Which is not a bad album by any means) or \"Clayman\" (Which is far more commercial, but still not dull enough to be entirely mallcore) as the rotten apples in the orchard, but I beg to differ. \"Whoracle\" is where In Flames' most poignant flaws (No, it's not the whiny multi-tracked vocals nor the vacuum-cleaner distortion, not yet) come to light, and they piss me off.\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s begin with Anders\u2019 annoying performance. This guy was never a great vocalist to begin with, always sounding way too much hoarse, at least to my ears. Also, he should never, NEVER try to sing clean vocals. Nevertheless, we are forced to listen to his irritating and downright laughable crooning in every single In Flames album since \"The Jester Race\". Take \"Jester Script Transfigured\", for an example. That's a pretty nice and relaxing ballad with great melodies and an overall trippy feeling, but Friden's abysmal clean vocals fucking ruin the verses and severely maim the atmosphere of this nice song. Also when he's not trying to sing, he just... Talks (Jotun's verses) or does some kind of stupid and nonsensical voiceover (Intro of \"Worlds within the Margin\"). Goddamn, just shut up and let the guitars play!\n\nIf you're the vocalist of a melodeath band and sometimes feel like skipping the growls, you should try to reach some degree of melody with your voice! For an example, Mikael Stanne's experimentation with clean vocals on Projector sound a billion times better than this. \n\nAs for the guitars, they really don't impress me. I mean, Jesper's fancy melodies and cool soloing are still there, but the riffing is awful and repetitive as hell. Take a look at \"Jotun\"; the first 33 seconds of the song are cool and rocking enough, but suddenly Anders comes out of nowhere with his cemetery answering machine vocals and everything goes downhill, the riffing becomes a lot of simple mallcore chugging and the main melody gets repeated into oblivion. The same thing happens with other songs like \"Episode 666\" and \"The Hive\", where they just keep playing the same goddamn riff over and over again with very slight modifications, and on top of that, we have Anders droning, uninteresting vocal attack that shows no dynamics, no forcefulness and no variation whatsoever.\n\n\nApparently, \"Whoracle\" has a concept behind it. The fact is that if you don't know this, you will only find out after some research, because the godawful lyrics won't help you. I mean, \"Episode 666\" is about an apocalyptic event that's being televised, but who the hell would've guessed it? That shit doesn't make sense at all! Listen, I\u2019m all into abstract, metaphorical and subjective music (I like Arcturus), but this meaningless garbage is terrible. You've got a pretty nice concept behind your album and you just don't know how to put it into lyrics? Screw this, go listen to Edge of Sanity and learn something.\n\nThe drums are pretty standard and the bass is mostly inaudible. Big surprise, ain't it? Yeah, this is a far cry from the Subterranean EP days.\n\nNow, this isn't a totally worthless album, there are some cool things here and there. In Flames always knew how and when to use acoustics, and they do one hell of a good work here, every acoustic passage on this album rocks (Even the title track), especially on my favorite track \"Dialogue with the Stars\" (Guess why? Yes, it's an instrumental), that has a folky atmosphere going on and remembers me of this band's best song, Moonshield. Also, the synth parts in \"Worlds within the Margin\" are subtle but pretty cool if you manage to ignore Ander's attempts to imitate a parrot.\n\nI really like those brief moments when Str\u00f6mblad remembers he's a talented guitarist and decides to nail kickass solos in otherwise boring songs (The Hive, Morphing Into Primal and the aforementioned WWTM, where the synths meld with the guitars in the end of the solo, creating a brief but very cool wall of sound).\n\nWell, this one receives a lot of praise, but I'm telling you, it's not all that good. If you have an open mind and can get past the sheer repetition and awful vocals, there's a chance you might dig this. If that's the case, check out \"Dialogue with the Stars\" for a very nice instrumental, \"Jester Script Transfigured\" for a great 'space rock acoustic guitar meets folky electric riffs' ballad, \"Gyroscope\" for another fun balance between acoustic/electric, \"The Hive\" for cool power metal soloing and \"WWTM\" for simple but tasteful synth usage and that's it. Oh, and do yourself a favor and ignore the Depeche Mode cover, please.\n\nIf you're new to In Flames, check out \"Colony\" or \"The Jester Race\" first, leave this little uncoordinated chugfest for later, the band can (or could) do better.\n",
        "\nIn Flames have had a lot of ups and downs over their career, and \"Clayman\" is definitely an up. I read a lot of the reviews telling people why this album sucks, so here is one saying why it doesn't.\n\nFirstly, Anders Friden's voice works. He has a fantastic death metal vocal sound that goes from a soaring scream to a deep throated growl, with everything in between, often in the same song - a good example of this would be the song \"Square Nothing\" which also includes some of the only 'clean' singing on the album (unlike their later releases which have a lot more of this evident.) \n\nMusically, the album follows a similar pattern, in that we have hard and fast throughout, interjected with slightly slower elements that pop up every now and then. This, however doesn't detract from the overall pace of the album, and what you have, essentially is a heavy fast paced album that doesn't really let up from start to finish. Right from the get go with the song \"Bullet Ride\" you get a feel of how the rest of the album is going to shape up. The drumming is fast and relentless, the riffs are pounding and heavy, and the guitar solos hit just the right tone that add the final awesome touch to the sound. I think the best song on this album, which essentiall epitomises the classic In Flames sound has to be the title track. The song Clayman starts off with a driving drum beat, and melodic guitars riffing over the top, with Friden's distinctive guttaral growls kicking in fairly quickly. This doesn't let up the whole track, and at the end you are left with a metal sign raised, and your head banging. You just can't help it!\n\nIncidentally, it was that song, and eventually this album that got me into death metal in the first place, so I have a personal respect for it...\n\nIn Flames have done some pretty lame stuff (Soundtrack to your Escape), and I know a lot of metal fans who hate them for this. But as far as an exciting, well paced and musically excellent album goes, you can do a lot worse than Clayman.\n",
        "\nThe Black-Ash Inheritance\" EP is a spacial collector's item that clearly represents the In Flames sound from that particular \"Whoracle Colony\" era, their sound was about death metal vocals and catchy harmonized guitar riffs as an Iron Maiden influence, it wasn't about fast and complex guitar solos, but about melodic metal guitars with harsh vocals. \n\nThe first 2 songs are a perfect example of that sound: \"Gyroscope\" which can be found in the Whoracle album, and \"Goliaths disarm their Davids\" that is one of the main reason why the EP is deeply appreciated by some fans, it is one of the best songs from that In Flames era.\n\nIn Flames, just as other melodic death metal bands back then, used to introduce an instrumental track in every album, this wasn\u00b4t the exception, the EP includes \"Acoustic Medley\", an acoustic version that contains pieces of songs from \"The Jester Race\" Album. Unfortunately the EP ends with a live performance of \"Behind Space\", where Anders live vocals will make you beg for the original Mikael Stanne's growls. \n\nFor the ones that are thinking in getting this EP, I have to state that there was a re-release of \"The Jester Race\" album that included the same 4 songs from this EP as bonus tracks. So if you are the kind of person that is only interested in the music, I recommend you to not buy the EP and seek for that \"The Jester Race\" re-release. Only an extreme fan of the band would try to get the \"Black Ash Inheritance\" EP, not only because it is a special collector's item, but because the CD is actually shaped as Jester's head and it contains one of the best In Flames songs from that era \"Goliaths disarm their Davids\".\n",
        "\nIn Flames is one of those bands that many people just love to hate. While I still like their newer stuff I can\u2019t help but understand why some people feel it\u2019s weak even though I think it\u2019s morbidly underrated. What I fail to understand is the hate that people have for In Flames\u2019 earlier albums. Their first 4 albums are essentially near-flawless masterpieces, with Clayman following very closely behind. Of all their albums however, I always have a certain personal admiration for Whoracle. I can\u2019t really explain it really, since I consider this album on par with The Jester Race and Colony, but there you go\u2026\n\nThe album opener, Jotun, shows what\u2019s new for In Flames since The Jester Race. Well actually the change was visible on the Black Ash Inheritance EP. This is extremely melodic metal. You might say melodic death metal but that\u2019s really just because the vocals are reminiscent of death metal compared to, say, power metal, which is melodic and what some less enlightened fellows seem to call In Flames. They have some of the most beautiful and yet at the same time powerful riffs I\u2019ve heard. Anders\u2019 vocals are excellent and certainly stronger than what they would become later on. \n\nThis excellent style of extremely melodic riffs packed with Anders\u2019 old growls and some very good bass and drum work continues all throughout the album. Foods For The Gods, Gyroscope, Worlds Within The Margin, Episode 666\u2026.all of these are the definition of melodic death metal. \n\nThere is, however, one track that I\u2019ve omitted for this \u201cbest-of\u201d list and that\u2019s The Hive. \nDon\u2019t think that I hate it\u2026quite the contrary. I didn\u2019t mention it because it\u2019s simply the most amazing track on here. If it would end at the 2:45 mark it would be among the above tracks, that is an excellent melodeath song. However, then comes the solo. Jasper pulls off what it undoubtedly the best melodic solo I\u2019ve heard. It\u2019s breathtaking. I must admit, however, that I haven\u2019t listened to Dark Tranquillity\u2019s classic first two albums nor to Arch Enemy\u2019s first three so I can\u2019t say it\u2019s the best solo from the genre. But this is still incredible. \n\nOther qualities that make this album as amazing as, well, as amazing as I say it is, are the two instrumental tracks, Dialogue With The Stars and the closing title track as well as the more experimental track Jester Script Transfigured. Dialogue With The Stars is a beautiful acoustic piece laden with melodic riffs that does an excellent job at dividing the album between the first three tracks and the rest of the album, and Whoracle is a very different piece which goes in a crescendo all through its 2 minutes 44 seconds and actually contains some very beautiful yet very low volume female vocals by Ulrika Netterdahl. \n\nIf you\u2019re reading this review and the ones below it you probably like or are at least interested by melodic death metal. Or you\u2019re simply one of the too many morons who seem to like to give bad reviews to any melodic death metal album while stating that the genre sucks\u2026not that we\u2019re asking ourselves what you\u2019re doing here but anyway. I\u2019m happy now I got that out of my system. In short this is an excellent album for those of you who can understand its innumerable qualities. Get this if you like melodic death metal because it\u2019s among the best of the genre. The only slight flaw that prevents this from obtaining a 100% rating lies in the relative weakness of the seventh track, Morphing Into Primal, which I simply consider to be on a lower level than the rest of the album.\n",
        "\nSo it all begins here, this is technically In Flames\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 debut album since their actual first album was more of a project featuring Dark Tranquillty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vocalist Mikael Stanne and that was merely a favor granted by him. Apparently after that debut, two years later the band released this crown jewel. This album in comparison to LUNAR STRAIN has a better production, not to mention they have abandoned their former death metal style riffs. True, this is still melodic in a sense, but it is too melodic to even be considered in the category as melodic death metal. While this album shows harsh vocals and down tuned guitars, this is basically Iron Maiden with harsh vocals. Most \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true\u00e2\u20ac\u009d metalheads would consider this as blasphemy known as the Gothenburg genre of metal, I however think this is a grand sound presented by the former grand Swedish band, In Flames.\n\n\nThe overall music itself is very unique in general featuring twin harmony guitars playing at a pace that is, well, rather fast. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost as similar to speed metal in a sense, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound like classic speed metal. Take for example the song December Flower, it is by far the best song on the album played in a speed metal tune with a great solo to match (even though their producer performed it for them). Other features on this album also include acoustic guitar. Moonshield proudly displays this kind of guitar work while not being the most interesting song on the album, it still packs one hell of a punch. Not to mention the instrumentals which feature both kinds of guitar tone. The Jesters Dance is a short instrumental that features some nice riffs while Wayfaerer is a power packed song with a lot of nice keyboard solos.\n\n\nBasically what we have here is a modern form of maiden worship to the extent where one would think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death metal, but it really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t death metal at all. Its power metal with harsh vocals and in my opinion it is very well executed than the majority of Gothenburg sound based albums.\n\n\nIf you have a case of UltraBorism or just believe that this kind of sound \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sucks\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, then this album is obviously not for you. However if you do like the twin harmonizing sound that these guys play on their guitars then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll like this album and maybe their next few releases like, WHORACLE, COLONY, and CLAYMAN.\nTake it from me, I bought their Japanese release.\n",
        "\nThis is In Flames' seventh album, and it's without a doubt among the most hated albums in all of metal.\nHell, this has an average 8% below Metallica's disgusting St.Anger right here on the Metal-Archives. I want to state right here that the hate that this album gets is vastly undeserved, since it's still metal, and it's very far from bullshit like Korn and Linkin Park, the mallcore/nu-metal bands that most reviewers compare Soundtrack To Your Escape (STYE) to. \n\nThe opening track, F(r)iend stats off quite well with some whispered female electronic vocals and a nice little riff. Good drumming too. Anders' opening vocals are allright...a few seconds later though they get annoying. Then the chorus starts. Anders screams Fiend over and over in a way that's so fucking shitty and irritating that it makes every other In Flames song ever done seem like the best ever. This is their worst song ever. It drags the rest of the album down so much I wouldn't be surprised that, without it, the average ratings by everyone would go up 20%. At least. Skip it or die.\n\nThe rest of the album is fortunately much, much better. The Quiet Place and Touch of Red are the supposedly \"popular\" tracks on here, as they've been chosen as the two singles and music videos. I'll be reviewing the clips too since I have the slipcase version with a DVD including the two clips. The Quiet Place is quite a strong track, it should have been the opener, there's no doubt about that. It's clip is actually very well done, especially the part that accompanies the opening riff, shaking the camera and making it seem generally quite heavy. The other single is Touch of Red, which is again quite a strong song, although not as good as The Quiet Place. My problem with this one is the clip. In Flames, you're fucking Swedish. That means, Anders, that you don't go around with a Hummer in Los Angeles, getting your car cleaned by a bunch of American girls with wet white shirts while while the rest of the band pretend to be Orange County bikers with their Harley's. And the Pitbull/Ipod scenes really, really make this seem like the most mallcore song ever. Could be a clip for a Tampa Death Metal band or maybe some retarded rappers, but In Flames...\n\nThe rest of the album is in my opinion quite good. Many songs really sound similar to each other to the limit of being considered filler, but even there they sound good. Nice riffs in most places, with some added electronic effects which really seem to make many metalheads shit themselves. Lyrically we're dealing with the standard In Flames crap about mostly psychotic stuff. Better avoid focusing on the lyrical content of this one. \n\nSo I say that this album is vastly underrated and the hate it receives is undeserved. However, even though I like it more than 90% of people out there I can't help but state that it's undoubtedly their worst full-length ever. The songs tend to blend in with each other, especially after Evil In A Closet.\nThe highlights on here include The Quiet Place, the aforementioned Evil In a Closet for sounding very light while he's screaming like a moron (in a good way) and My Sweet Shadow. This loses points because of the bland lyrics, the lack of originality and variation with many songs and especially the opener F(r)iend, the worst song ever done by this band. This doesn't deserve neither the hate it receives nor a rating above 79%. I just can't give this 80 or above. Approach this with an open mind.\n",
        "\nThis is the first In Flames CD I picked up, I wanted to hear what they sounded like. At first, I liked it, but as soon as I found Colony\u2026 I started seeing the Played Last on WinAMP being listed in the previous year for most of the album (My Sweet Shadow being an exception)\n\nCompared to their older material, this doesn\u2019t hold a candle to those flames. However, I like this a bit better than Reroute To Remain, but only because of a few characteristics that have improved upon on this album. \n\nOne thing that is noticeable right away is the use of electronics, samples, effects, and all sorts of shit. I wasn\u2019t brought up into metal right away, a lot of the music I listened to years ago included techno and alternative, so this doesn\u2019t sound completely horrible to my ears. It doesn\u2019t strike me as a way to make extremely good music though. The huge mass of electronics add an atmosphere that, well, makes this album sound electronic. On some songs, they don\u2019t do much at all however. \n\nThe guitars are played in a way that is supposed to compliment the electronic effects. They are not always the lead instruments on this album. However, the distortion doesn\u2019t kill the guitars (much). They still sound somewhat in your face; they aren\u2019t watered down to the point where the balls are cut off, rather they are only shrunk. There are still some acoustic (albeit acoustic-electric) breaks, however they are also complimented by atmospheric electronics. \n\nIt seems that one thing In Flames wanted to accomplish with this album is to do something original. They have somewhat accomplished that, as there\u2019s no Maiden worship here. Do they do that well? Not really. The songs aren\u2019t put together that well, and while I used to love this album, most grew old really fast, and I tend to wait a long time before listening to them again. \n\nAs for the bass, I can\u2019t hear any. There is so much distortion in the guitars, effects in Anders\u2019 voice, electronics in the background and shit that the bass doesn\u2019t come through in the mix at all. \n\nAnd the drums, they are horrible, they are watered down and don\u2019t always keep up with the songs themselves. They sound overdubbed, the bass drum and snare sound like plastic, they sound fake.\n\nThe hightlights are My Sweet Shadow, Superheroes of the Computer Rage, and Dial 595 Escape. This album had some potential, if they put in more solos and actual lead work, worked on improving the sound of their drums, and cut down on the effects, they might\u2019ve had a much better album. But then again, that\u2019s a lot to cut out.\n",
        "\nIn Flames... a name that has seemed to join the ranks of Metallica and others as being a sell-out. However, back in the day they were the elite in melodic death metal. Friden didn't sound like Elmer Fudd, his growls were more menacing, more towards Mikael Stanne than before. \n\nI keep hearing The Jester Race as being their greatest work, yet I think Colony is much better, with more depth and feeling. Where does this leave Whoracle? Right in the middle. This is a step up from The Jester Race and just a wee bit less than Colony. \n\nThe overall feel that skyrocketed Colony to my all time favorite Melodeath disc is present on this CD as well, but at the same time this has the classic acoustic work that In Flames seems to have abandoned lately. They add more depth to the songs, such as Gyroscope. Without the acoustic intro, that song wouldn\u2019t have as much of a punch to it like it does now. \n\nWhat play the biggest role in creating a brilliant atmosphere are the guitars. The riffs are amazing, they are tight and fun to listen to, dancing around the fret board like\u2026 little jesters. That\u2019s what I envision these riffs to be, little jesters dancing on a fret board. Putting away the silliness, one thing In Flames does so extremely well are the rhythms. They are energetic and drive the solos crazier than if there were just a bass accompanying them. \n\nHowever, the bass provides a subtle backdrop of power that isn\u2019t as in your face, but it\u2019s similar to the feel that is given by the acoustic parts. During the acoustic interludes, the bass is most apparent, but when there are rhythm guitars flying off during a solo, it takes a careful ear to hear the bass.\n\nThe drumming is fairly standard, it\u2019s tight with the guitars and bass and does its job. That\u2019s all I really need to say about it.\n\nAnders\u2019 vocals on this album are a lot better than what they have become in recent years. Even when he attempts clean singing, he doesn\u2019t sound like Elmer Fudd, although he\u2019s no Bruce Dickinson either. His growls are better than the ear ringing shrieks he develops later on to accompany his Fudd impressions, they meld in with the guitar parts a hell of a lot better than on their later albums. His lyrics are the standard metaphorical abstractions that seem to be the only similarity between this album and STYE. However, on here, they are more focused on the state of humankind, while on STYE they are focused on the state of Anders\u2019 mind.\n\nThere is hardly any filler on this album. Dialogue With The Stars might be considered such, as it\u2019s only a 3 minute instrumental, but it\u2019s far from boring. It\u2019s not the kind of filler that provokes one to skip it. The very last track on this album, Whoracle, is\u2026 but it\u2019s in the best spot \u2013 the last track. It\u2019s a rather boring outro, and the worst song on the album, and In Flames had the common courtesy to put it last, yet it still manages to be beautiful. Not even the cover on this album, Everything Counts by Martin Lee Gore, sounds filler. It fits in nicely with the rest of the album, although it\u2019s not quite to the standard as the rest. However, by now I\u2019m satisfied, I usually change CD\u2019s after this song anyway.\n\nHighlights: World Within the Margin, Episode 666, Gyroscope, Jotun\n",
        "\nIt's understandable why fans of older In Flames material would become disenfranchised with them after the release of Soundtrack to Your Escape. Every band has a \"fluke\" in sound somewhere in their discography, especially when they have a career as long as In Flames'. Everyone just assumed that the odd disc out was Reroute to Remain. As it turns out this wasn't the case. In Flames seems to enjoy the direction they are moving with that album and Soundtrack to Your Escape continues in that vain. \n\nThe album on a whole is more aggressive this time around but still incorporates melodic synth lines and some gothic toned vocals. The music itself is presented as fairly simple but after seeing some of the material live it goes over remarkable well on stage. So there is some depth to the album that is hidden out of listeners range.\n\nThe guitar work is in that ideology of simple and aggressive. That heavier riffs and simplified melodies can make an album a bit more aggressive. Some fans may argue with this, but the album does seem a lot more aggressive. There is still technicality in the guitar work but with In Flames' new guitar tones and rougher overall sound, that technicality can be lost in the distortion. The leads still have that Iron Maiden inspiration but that has been massively toned down too. The crunch of the guitar work has really moved the band away from their melodic death metal moniker. The solos are still well written and performed and will always be a reason I listen to In Flames. The solos are a little more varied on the album which leads to some very lack luster ones and others that sound like they could have come straight off of The Jester Race. Another aspect of the guitars that is different on this album is the stop and go chunks that they incorporate. Many songs have a \"nu metal\" vibe because of the stop and go guitar writing. It's not a constant on the album but it does appear often.\n\nThe bass work is a big part of Soundtrack to Your Escape. With an increased focus on rhythm and aggression the bass work has taken a new meaning. Unfortunately, this means the bass lines have also been simplified from before. They follow the guitars more often and don't blaze their own trails. The bass is mixed more distinctly for that modern sound but in the end the bass is actually not as good because of its relevance.\n\nThe drums haven't changed that much over the years. They have moved further and further away from a death metal sound and towards a technical and varied tone. There are still various killer double bass kicks and blasts on this album but it is once in a blue moon. The drums really are the boundaries for the music and keep it in a linear fashion. I would be tempted to claim that the drums on this album are overall a better way for Svensson to show his drumming abilities. Definitely one of the best performances he has given.\n\nThe vocals are the biggest complaint for Soundtrack to Your Escape. I personally don't have a big problem with Anders \"new\" vocal style but some people seem to really dislike them. Anders has never been a great vocalist. His vocals, for me, have been sliding downhill since Whoracle so when he did decide to add a new layer I didn't think it could be that bad. He continues from where he left off on Reroute to Remain and incorporates two different styles. The harsh yelling he does (calling them death vocals is a stretch for me) and his baritone, gothic toned singing. This album layers these two over each other quite often with either the yelling or singing in the forefront and the other as a backing vocal. He does quick vocal changes on the album quite off in the middle of songs so don't expect one song to be one style and the next song to be different. \n\nThe continuation of the use of keys on the album is where most of the melody is born. Although I'm pretty sure that the key board parts are really just guitars with distortion at times, the keys do add a new layer that I enjoy. The synth lines can be a little annoying at times but overall they do add some melody on an album where the guitars aren't focused on leads any more. \n\nThe lyrics have once again moved away from astronomy and fantasy and moved towards a personal and societal aspect. This is truly where Anders Friden shines. His lyrics are those clever lyrics that have multiple meanings and are dark in nature. I do enjoy the lyrics to this album very much and they are what really keep me coming back to listen. When I found out that the song, F(r)iend, is about Dark Tranquillity I was shocked. Just another layer to the lyrics that I didn't catch at first. \n\nOverall this album is quite catchy. If you are an old In Flames fan who enjoys their older material - you will not enjoy this album. I for one try to keep an open mind when listening to music and found that this album does have much to appreciate when you are willing to look for it. There are definitely flaws abound on the album but its not as bad as most people claim.\n\nSongs to check out: F(r)iend, My Sweet Shadow, Borders and Shading.\n",
        "\nThis is the album where In Flames emulated Iron Maiden the right way. Colony may never win any points for originality or for being highly creative, but at least they do what they do in a tasteful manner. There is nothing truly original about Colony, or even spectacular for that matter. As state3d previously, this is Iron Maiden worship. It may not be apparent at first, but the homage to Maiden is there. It\u2019s just covered by a thin veil of down tuned guitars and snarled vocals.\n\nThe order of the day found on colony is straight forward groove riffing with a taste for bouncy and catchy. Every riff is instantly memorable due to the blithesome display of melody throughout. Every melody is decorated with notes selected for the sake of pure sonic pleasure. They arouse a strange sense of joy within the listener. It is not the type of joy experienced after a mighty triumph, but a casual, everyday type of joy. This type of joy is delivered without unbearable drama or stinky cheesiness or even pretentiousness. It is just simple happy sappy joy, nothing complicated.\n\nThe songwriting is relatively straightforward, mainly based on rock song formats. A dominating consonance is found throughout each and every song. The melodies and harmonies are simple and catchy, but yet articulate enough to avoid overwhelming boredom. Riffs and melodies frequently recur in cyclical song structures. Yet, because the riffs are highly addicting, it never quite degenerates into lame redundancy or self-parody. Quite on the contrary, one might find themselves returning for more audio pleasure.\n\nIf there is ever an acceptable commercial metal album, this is it. In Flames have accomplished what every pop artist aspires to do. Certainly this will appeal to a wide range of listeners. Nothing is complicated, and there are no deep concepts. It doesn\u2019t aspire to achieve greatness or anything of artistic development. However, it sure does make for one hell of a guilty pleasure.\n",
        "\nAs Colony saw In Flames move towards a more direct and accessible sound, Clayman pushed the formula to a new extreme and undoubtedly proved to be the band's turning point. Clayman was the first album to really add more rock-based fury to the signature Gothenburg sound that the band had crafted; harmonies and leads still remain intact, but are generally used in a more linear way; the band openly embrace experiments with different clean guitar tones, such as the shimmering notes on \"Square Nothing\" and \"Sattelites and Astronauts,\" and this is the first album from In Flames that truly delves into electronic noodlings with programmed beats and synths, such as \"Only for the Weak.\" Even more controversial is Ander's change in vocal style. Rather than the slightly airy growl of Colony or Whoracle, Anders switches gears with a mid-ranged scream that he would use from that moment on. There is also a full-on display of clean vocals, not just a backup like previous albums. Though this undoubtedly takes some of the \"death metal\" edge away from the band's sound, it nonetheless shows a band stepping into their own modernized niche, for better or worse.\n\nIt's clear from the opener \"Bullet Ride\" that things have changed. Bjorn and Jesper put on display the band's evolution in a poignant way; shimmering clean guitars pluck through the verses, and stop-start power chord phrases collaborate with warm, rich leads, which also seem to have progressed beyond the typical Gothenburg melodies. \"Swim\" brings back some old-school flair, and is probably one of the only songs that still fully resonates of the band's old formula. I would go so far to say that most of the guitar work exceeds the \"happy\" feel of even Colony, especially the arena-like \"Only for the Weak.\" Generally speaking, there aren't as many solos here, but it works within the music's more linear scope; the band still retain a healthy amount of melodeath tendencies, so it doesn't take too much away.\n\nDaniel certainly stepped his game up, and in turn, it helps out the rest of the band. The more clean-cut song structures give the drums an extra push, seeing that there are more fills and overall confidence. The title track is a clear display of this. A cleaner, fuller drum sound also helps things out a great deal as well.\n\nAnd now for Anders. For those who never liked his voice, this album most likely won't change your minds. His throaty yell/scream is not quite what he would use on RtR or STYE, but Clayman shows his venturing into that particular style. \"Satellites and Astronauts\" and \"Brush the Dust Away\" showcase the debut of his infamous clean vocals, albeit in a more subtle manner. Truth be told, it's a hell of a lot better than what was to come, but it will certainly grate the nerves of those who loathed him to begin with. Lyrically, things have gotten better, and like the rest of the music, more direct. Everything takes a more personal slant into self-doubt and introspection, with \"Brush the Dust Away\" being the only exception, since it takes a similar stance to older albums.\n\nThough haters of the band easily target this album and flame it, this is the ultimate turning point for In Flames. They certainly couldn't make another Colony, and I'm actually rather grateful for that. Clayman serves as the perfect introduction to In Flames, and it contains the ultimate classic \"Pinball Map,\" an essential In Flames track.\n",
        "\nWithout doubt, In Flames had established themselves as melodic death's sweethearts with the release. Unlike their Gothenburg brethren, In Flames used a more direct feel to their music that was quite different from the long, winded structures of Dark Tranquillity. One could almost say that it was rock-based; most of the song structures were very verse-chorus, and the major-key guitar leads added a very ear-friendly edge to the sound. Good as The Jester Race was, there were still some flaws in it; the drumming was mind-numbingly boring, the production a bit hampered, and a few moments lack attitude and diversity. All of that is fixed on Whoracle. Personally, I would say that this is the essential In Flames album. Though many of the song structures are still rock-based, things seem fresher and renewed in the songwriting department. Aside from that, things on all fronts have stepped up to prove this album as a classic.\n\nThe guitars are now the center of focus. Not only have the riffs gotten more complex, but also have a more adventurous sense of melody. \"Gyroscope\" features epic harmonies and acoustic touches that cascade down to a pounding verse, while \"Jester Script Transfigured\" sees the guitars delve almost totally into somewhat experimental territory, with cleanly strummed acoustic verses and an almost folkish feel. Things are layered quite heavily, but never really get to a point of overwhelming; thick, meaty power chords rumble underneath of soaring leads and solos, most of which are harmonized. This notion alone makes it the holy grail for melodeath enthusiasts. Plenty of skill is put on display here; Bjorn and Jesper certainly have developed their chops since The Jester Race, and Whoracle makes perfect display of that. \"The Hive\" features one of the best melodic solos I've probably ever heard; and though the other solos don't quite live up to this one in particular, they bare their teeth with confidence. Also a notable change is the band's diving into faster tempos: \"Morphing Into Primal,\" albeit a bit tiresome and generic, shows that the band can bust out the grit when they really feel like it. Songs like these feature scorching alternate picking, traded off with more cruising mid-tempo sections and harmonies. Things here aren't as \"nu\" In Flames as on Colony, but exceed the plodding tandem that made up some of the Jester Race. After all, \"Jotun\" and \"Episode 666\" feature some great, classic riffs; what's not to love?\n\nAs a drummer, Bjorn still straddles a fine line of generic timekeeping and decent metal drumming. There are more transitions in the music here, so naturally things had to improve in one way or another; and they did. More fills pop up here, adding a bit of interest to the music. The tempos have also picked up, so nothing seems to drag as they once did. Aside from this, the drums don't really do anything special; they're just in the music for the sake of a backbeat. \n\nAnders also makes a vast improvement. Though not on the level of what he would achieve on Colony, he still holds his own. His feral growls have a bit more aggression and polish behind them, and aren't as restricted. This is best shown on \"Worlds Within the Margin,\" where only ghostly synths and drums back his vocals during the verses. Things never really stray from the gritty half-growl, but it seems to work within the constantly evolving scope of the music. Lyrically, it's another trip into weirdness; covering things inside the human mind and thought processes, and some other cryptic things that would fly over the head of those who don't really analyze the lyrics. (Like me.)\n\nWhoracle's powerful production is what really makes it shine, courtesy of Studio Fredman. The drums now pack a walloping, clear punch; all of the guitars are crisp and articulate, and the bass is not only heard, but has a perfect balance of mids and lows, making for a perfectly audible rhythm section along with the layered guitar parts. Anders' vocals have a slight bit of echo on them at some points, and this works really well on the more drawn-out growls during \"Episode 666.\"\n\nSlightly generic drumming/songwriting aside, as well as the terrible Depeche Mode cover, (How dare those bastards... They ruined a classic pop song, possibly my favorite song by my favorite non-metal band.) Whoracle was an essential step up for In Flames, and is probably their best album to date in terms of replay value, status and remembrance. If you're a fan of melodeath, you owe it to yourself to hear this album.\n\nFavorite tracks: \"Jotun,\" \"Gyroscope,\" \"The Hive,\" \"Episode 666.\"\n",
        "\nSome people have contested this album\u2019s worth as a Death Metal album. They claimed that the style of play found here is more akin to a power metal band. Yet, it is a mystery why no one has contested this album\u2019s worth as a metal album, period. It is difficult to consider this metal at all, much less power metal, and certainly not death metal.\n\nThe only time In Flames truly shines is on the very first song, Moonshield. This song is a masterpiece, and it stands as a mountain among wee little mole hills, which is the rest of the album. Cleverly crafted folk melodies are interwoven throughout the track with such exquisite delicacy. If In Flames composed the rest of the songs in similar manner, it may very well be praiseworthy.\n\nUnfortunately, they don\u2019t. It seems as though In Flames spent all of their energies and efforts for the sole purpose of producing Moonshield. On the rest of the album, it just seems like they half-assed it. The brilliant wanderings prevalent on Moonshield are absent on every single other song. Instead, they are replaced with wimpy riffs whose melodies resemble that of commercial jingles. Every riff contains a happy bouncy feel; the kind of feel one experiences when listening to a pop album. In fact, it is safer to categorize The Jester Race as a pop/rock album, rather than a metal album.\n\nAnother attribute which makes this more of a pop/rock album than anything is the rather stale songwriting. All the do is layer riff after riff of sheer ineptitude. They are more bent on formulating hooks than any feasible songwriting. To make matters worse, these hooks are not very well supported. They\u2019re overly consonant and devoid of any interesting contrast. The melodies are more prone to drive the listener up the wall with sappy sentimentality. \n\nWhy is this album praised? Why is it even considered metal? It is just a collection of bouncy riffs and malformed melodies which are miserable attempts at emulating Iron Maiden. The only time In Flames has been successful at emulating Iron Maiden is on Colony. That\u2019s right, Colony is better. In fact, it is actually quite enjoyable. The Jester Race is not.\n",
        "\nWhile Whoracle saw In Flames perfecting their craft wrought on The Jester Race, Colony expanded the band's sound into more accessible, and yet heavier territory. What is put out here sounds like the best elements of Whoracle, such as melodic soloing, put together with the more straight-forward and less evolved passages on Clayman. In a sense, Colony is the apex of the old In Flames sound before they veered off into different terrain. All of the Gothenburg tendencies are still present, but seem to be restored with a more dynamic, controlled edge by the subtle but important introduction of slightly more independent and artsy flair. Not so much that it comes off as \"experimental,\" but there is definitely something different at work here.\n\nThese new elements that I speak of really aren't outrageously noticeable, but do give the songs a pretty big boost. Daniel's addition to the band as drummer definitely rears its head; Bjorn's drumming was pretty generic and boring, and while Daniel's skills weren't as progressed on this album, they certainly make themselves known. \"Scorn\" boasts some impressive, although simple, double bass work that adds a lot of guts to the song that otherwise wouldn't be there. Daniel seems more confident behind the kit, and does a great job of adding some ear candy to the album. Other elements on the album include keyboards, such as the organ on the title track, or the stand-alone piano on \"Ordinary Story.\" The instrumental \"Pallar Anders Visa\" shows a wise use of violins and harmonized acoustic guitars. Anders also takes a stab at some clean vocals here, too. We saw some of it on Whoracle in the form of really low-register talking, but on the title track and \"Coerced Coexistence,\" Anders actually tries singing; and to be truthful, it sounds a lot better than what he does now. \n\nAside from his occasional clean vocals, Anders' growls seem more clear and focused here; more gutteral. \"Zombie Inc.\" in particular offers some great vocals, switching gears between throaty snarls and the more fierce growl/scream. Lyrically, things have only gotten more cryptic, especially on \"Resin\" and the title track. There are some recurring themes, though, mainly focusing on societal problems and materialism. Anders' performance is probably his best of old era In Flames, certainly better than that of Clayman.\n\nBjorn and Jesper are at the top of their game here. Nearly every song features a solo, and all of them stand out in their own way. Whether it's the fast-paced shredding urgency of \"Coerced Coexistence\" or the re-recording of \"Behind Space,\" the melodic, flight-of-fancy solos never fail, and play a larger role in the overall sound than previous albums. Everything in the guitar work seems more focused and ear-catching, mainly the harmonies on the absurdly catchy opener, \"Embody the Invisible.\" Harmonies run amok throughout the course of the album, and both guitars collaborate wonderfully to construct proto-Gothenburg melodies, some of which are probably too happy-sounding for their own good. A flawless performance though, and a signature Abyss studios production ensures clarity and guts in the guitar playing.\n\nI have to take off some points, though; both \"Insipid 2000\" and \"The New World\" are boring as hell, and only drag the end of the album down with mediocrity, repetitive structures. and lack of ideas.\n\nThis album certainly isn't for most death metal fans, particularly those who are looking for something dark in nature. Truth be told, this album sounds ridiculously bouncy and happy at some points, probably because most of the guitar parts were composed in major keys. Oh well. A great album, and the last really good album from In Flames.\n",
        "\nThe past few years have certainly been up and down for In Flames. Being one of the supposed pioneers of the melodeath genre is a hard role to undertake, and even harder to maintain. So when Clayman came out, many cried foul and claimed that the band had sold out. The shit really hit the fan when Soundtrack to Your Escape came out in 2004; multiple singles were released, the band adopted a more ear-friendly style, and they continued to flirt with electronica/industrial overtones in the songs. Now, I think that the band jumped the gun when they said Come Clarity would be a return to form, because this sure as hell isn't Whoracle; but they were certainly correct when they said it would meld the best aspects of the old and new sound.\n\nOk, so what exactly did they bring back that everyone is ranting about? Solos and harmonies, firstly. Nearly all of the tracks contain some sort of soaring lead guitar work, especially on \"Crawl Through Knives\" and \"Vanishing Light.\" Solos are also pretty commonplace here, too. Maybe not the face-ripping, shredding sort, but it's an improvement over palm-muted riffs that never stop. (Which still have their place here, by the way, but are used in a more effective way.) \"Vacuum\" contains some nifty neo-thrash riffage that switches up with a chorus that could be taken from the Colony album. Even through the reincarnation of harmonies and nifty guitar acrobatics, the band remain steadfast on the techniques used on Reroute to Remain and Soundtrack to Your Escape. Many of the leads used a backed by steady, palm-muted chords, and \"Vanishing Light\" has verses full of that. \"Our Infinite Struggle\" also starts and ends with an assembly of riffs that seem like better B-sides of what has been used on the past 2 albums, but the fiery opener \"Take This Life\" sees the bands infusing the two styles into a beast of thrashy, mean proportions.\n\nUnfortunately for some of you, some things do remain intact that will make your skin crawl; mainly the sticky choruses and the electonic flirtations. \"Leeches\" contains a chorus that will catch ears for some, as it shows one of Anders' best uses of his clean vocals; but others will cringe at it and simply dismiss it as a sad attempt at emo or radio-friendly ear candy. \"Dead End\" is probably the most infamous track for using this technique, as the guys had the balls to bring in a Swedish pop singer to do vocals throughout the verses. Many scoffed at this notion, but listening to this track, I probably would have shot myself in the face if Anders attempted what this chick did on the song. (\"Scream\" is also guilty of this, but only because it almost sounds mallcore.) The title track has caught tons of flack for its acoustic characteristics, cheesy chorus, and all-around \"softness.\" But truth be told, it's really not a bad track. It's a bit more on personal side, whihc is exactly what once needs before listening to \"Vacuum.\" Outside of the choruses, Anders again proves that he is either loved or hated. His screams are significantly more developed and stronger than what was on the previous album, and revert back to the style used on Clayman.\n\nDaniel's drumwork has gotten more aggressive and and daring in its scope, clearly displayed with the use of thrash beats on \"Take This Life\" and \"Vacuum.\" There is a wider use of double bass here, which works well within the more raw essence of the music. The drum sound is relieving from the trash-can sound of STYE; things seem more natural this time around, and things are heard easier.\n\nThe production is a double-edged sword: it has a wall-of-noise effect to it, which helps and hurts it. The industrial flirtations on \"Leeches\" and \"Your Bedtime Story is Scaring Everyone\" seem a bit muddled by everything else, but the fast-paced urgency of \"Vanishing Light\" and the opening track is only aided by the slightly distorted vocals, open drum sound, chunky-as-fuck bass, and lo-fi guitar distortion.\n\nCome Clarity certainly won't bring any old-schoolers back, but does show a step in the right direction for the band.\n\nFavorite tracks: \"Leeches,\" \"Vacuum,\" \"Vanishing Light.\"\n",
        "\nSo, just to get it out the way, yes In Flames has changed A LOT, yes they aren't quite the Melodic Death gods they once were, yes they enjoy experimenting and don't seem to care who they alienate, and yes Soundtrack to Your Escape was a pretty big disappointment. That being said, Come Clarity seems like they might finally be taking a step in the right direction again. Whereas Reroute to Remain (which despite everyone's hatred for it, is still one of my favorite albums of all time) and Soundtrack to Your Escape saw In Flames trying to move away from their roots to a more commercial and poppy sound, Come Clarity finds them, at least to some extent, moving back to their older sound. Now by older sound, I'm not talking about The Jester Race or Lunar Strain, I mean Colony and Clayman, because the days of The Jester Race are gone, and I highly doubt they're coming back.\n\nI wouldn't call CC a return to form so much as In Flames finally sounding comfortable with the music they make again. The music brings together most of the elements that In Flames has been trying to blend since Clayman. It has the energy of Colony, the electronics of STYE (albeit toned down greatly...thank god), the poppy sensibility and melodic vocals of Reroute to Remain, and guitar riff that, at least at points, recall Clayman.\n\nThat's not to say I think Come Clarity is perfect though, because it lacks a few things that In Flames still has left to perfect the sound I think they've been going for. Those elements being the return of the soaring guitars (there are hints of it throughout Come Clarity, but it's still lacking), and the less conventional song writing.\n\nAs a side note, I like Anders' voice, including his melodic singing, I think he just needs to get more comfortable with his voice (which if you listen to Reroute to Remain's singing and compare it to a track like say \"Crawl Through Knives\", you'll see that he's developed his voice quite a bit, so there's hope it will continue).\n\nBasically what it boils down to is that I while I love Come Clarity, I see it more as a piece of something greater to come.\n",
        "\nIn all fairness and as a preface, I will say that I am a rather large In Flames fan. Of course by this I mean all the previous albums leading up to this one had their fair time in my disk changer.\n\nWith that said, I think you'll understand that I am basing this album reveiw solely on the band's progression and experimentation, not on how good this album is compared to Clayman or even Whoracle.\n\nThe album starts off blandly with a small electronica synth intro then jumps forward into a nice riff and then everybody else begins to play. This song of course is the title track \"Reroute to Remain\". The production on this song and even the whole album is far too polished for my liking. Everything sounds so clean and pristene as opposed to the almost vicious pipeline of guitars I was used to when I would see their old stage shows. The drums have this odd way of sounding so far from what they are, such as the weird clicking sound their kick drum seems to have adopted. But aside from the production the way the songs are arranged is very cut and dry; verse / chorus / verse / breakdown / chorus. Well I think you get the point. The songs really are far too confined from what I was so used to before with the structure, it just gets far too narrow in scope and makes the songs seem a bit forced and not pre-meditated. \n\nStandout tracks are far and few between, but why I gave this album a high score rests solely on the 4 tracks I felt were the best out of the album. Obviously \"Trigger\" comes to mind yet I felt it was a poor choice for a single and video. \"Trigger\" is a pretty good track with a fantastic grind feel to the guitars that gives it a sort of likening to a trash song. The lyrics are sort of bland and don't really go anywhere or hold any more meaning than the papers they were probably scrawled on. The chorus is where the song comes together. Other standouts include \"Dawn of a New Day\", a bit of a risk being the most mellow track on the album and being relaltively tame, yet what sells it is the vocal work by Anders Friden and the acoustic passages. I'd also throw \"Egonomic\" in there as well as \"Black & White\" the album closer.\n\nAfter listening to the album for so many times I start to maybe see where the band had wanted to take this album, make it a bit of an experiment and go in a new direction. But after seeing this effort and their latest travesty, Come Clarity, I feel the band has gone in a horrible direction. This however is just my opinon and does not necessarily mean that this album is any worse for the later efforts.\n",
        "\nIn Flames continue to be the forerunners of the Gothenburg melodic death movement and with that responsibility comes the curse of having a ton of other bands copy the style as it changes. In Flames have once again changed their sound (only slightly) on their latest album, Come Clarity.\n\nCome Clarity is hardly a fitting title for this strangely mixed metal album. In Flames combined most of their previous styles into this album and then shook it all up to see what came out. Surprisingly, it\u2019s a lot better than that explanation can give. The music if still has a lot of the keyboard parts that were present on their last two (and most controversial) albums \u2013 but now most of the keyboard parts are pushed towards the back of the mixing of the album. The most striking difference in the musical style is the way in which the guitars are presented. The guitars are less groovy then some previous efforts but not completely death metal styled as they were earlier in their career. It\u2019s almost an exact 50/50 mix of the guitars on Colony and the guitars on Soundtrack to Your Escape. \n\nFor those of you who are new to In Flames, that means they are melodic and ferocious but with a little punch of modern metal. The album itself has the one of the best flows for an album released in the past year or so. And unusual as it is, the album actually progressively gets stronger and better towards the end of the album. Most albums pull a complete opposite of that \u2013 so if the first few tracks don\u2019t ring your bell (they are more in the newer style of In Flames) don\u2019t automatically turn of the music yet. Although, the last track still throws me for a loop every time I listen to the album. I say track because its not really a \u201csong\u201d per say \u2013 but an outro. The last track doesn\u2019t really fit the theme of the album or the flow. It throws off my listening and I usually just skip it so that I can move onto a new album.\n\nThe most controversial part of In Flames in the last few releases was Anders different and ever more melodic vocal stylings. Come Clarity shows him revert back to death gutturals in the later songs but continue some of his baritone low speaking parts and \u201csinging\u201d at times and in the majority of the first half of the album. It\u2019s a little of both worlds for In Flames. He really shines on songs like Scream and Pacing Death\u2019s Trail. Come Clarity, the song, displays his use of singing more than the guttural stuff \u2013 but it also displays his clever lyrical style more than that. \n\nHis use of vague and intellectual word combinations allows interpretations to be placed within the context of the song. His array of lyrical writing places value on the listener to be able to put their own experiences into allowing his lyrics to range from very personal to societal to conceptual. Really this is the best part of In Flames and always has been. \n\nOverall, Come Clarity is an improvement musically for In Flames but overall not near to par with their classics. On its own, the album is decently strong with faltering moments in the writing (mostly due to combining elements of all their previous music styles). So it\u2019s good but not great. And on a side note, purely vain, the cover for the album isn\u2019t very \u201cmetal.\u201d\n\nSongs to check out: Take this Life, Pacing Death\u2019s Trail, Versus Terminus\n",
        "\nI've never been to Sweden before. Ever. That said, if someone asked me what my favourite Swedish city was, without hesitation I'd answer in my best growly voice: \"Gothenbuuuuuurg!!!\" Well, actually I wouldn't because that's retarded, but Gothenburg is still a pretty cool city anyway. In the 90's it was a hotbed for all those melodic death metal-like bands such as In Flames and Dark Tranquillity. Eventually, the creative term Gothenburg metal was coined for bands with a similar background and sound. Both In Flames and Dark Tranquillity have since released some excellent albums such as The Jester Race (In Flames) and Character (Dark Tranquillity). But it doesn't stop there, as In Flames have also recorded other successful albums. One of them was 2000's Clayman. The album was recorded in, you guessed it, Gothenburg Sweden. The album contains some of the bands more popular songs, such as the catchy Only For the Weak.\n\nClayman is appears to be one of those albums that people seem to really like or really dislike, with the spectrum is pretty extreme including some who revere this album, and others who consider it a black eye on the band\u2019s career. For me, I find myself closer to the former as opposed to the latter, but I wouldn't exactly call it my favourite In Flames release. With that in mind, I still do like Clayman quite a bit. One of the reasons I enjoy this album so much is the actual music. While not especially heavy, Clayman is dripping with melody. And damn it, I have to have my melody. So I am more than happy with the direction the band has taken. Though purists may cry out blasphemy with this release, I feel that the lighter sound works very well for In Flames. Clayman feels very focused, riff after riff, drumbeat after drumbeat. Listening to songs such as, again, Only For the Weak or Pinball Map, it is apparent that the band has put a lot of effort into their music. Enjoyable, concise, and consistent are all adjectives which can be used to describe Clayman, as many of the albums songs feature several sections in which this the case. Clayman flows together very nicely and is definitely a fun album to listen to.\n\nIn Flames has one pretty important aspect that makes them a ton of fun to listen to. And that rests in that of their two axmen, Jesper Stromblad and Bjorn Geloette. Though their names are difficult to pronounce, the energetic playing of the tandem is not difficult to digest. These two give the band their signature sound, the enjoyable melody, hypnotizing harmonies, the crushingly heavy sections (for the most part), and the staggering solos. You couldn't really ask for anything more from the two members, as they perform their roles exceedingly well, and very rarely do they disappoint. Two songs where the pair stands out the most are Swim and Suburban Me. Both songs are very guitar orientated offerings, and on both songs Jesper and Bjorn give what are arguably their best performances. The riffs are exceedingly strong, combining the desired strength and melody. Also notable on Clayman regarding the two guitarists is the production on the guitars. Like many of the band's early albums, the guitars' tones are very enjoyable and definitely enhance the music. Just as in The Jester Race, Whoracle, and Colony, In Flames' guitarists steal the show, and are definitely among the highlights of the album.\n\nThough perhaps not as good as The Jester Race or even Colony, 2000's Clayman is still a marvellous album. It is home to all sorts of excellent material, such as the title track or Only For the Weak, which may very well be the catchiest song the band has ever recorded. Clayman, though not devoid of errors and mistakes, is an incredibly fun album to listen to, as there are not any limits to the level of melody and precision that is produced. The two catalysts of this sound, Jesper and Bjorn, have an impressive showing and definitely meet the expectations. Clayman is a very enjoyable record, and despite the mixed reviews, fans of Gothenburg metal should definitely not shy away.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nLooking back on the history of metal, it seems as though the early albums from many a band turn out to be that band's most popular, well received releases in their discography. This isn't always the case, yes, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come up with bands where this is true. From the mainstream metal scene, you've obvious bands like Metallica and Megadeth, who've released successful albums like Master of Puppets and Rust in Peace early on and then largely disliked albums including Risk and St. Anger. Then there are bands like Cradle of Filth and Helloween, who each have had successes early in their career, but have been criticized by masses of metal heads later on, fairly or unfairly. But it's those early albums like Keeper of the Seven Keys and In the Nightside Eclipse where most seem to generally agree that a classic rating is merited. Another band which seems to receive similar treatment is In Flames. Though their last few releases, Reroute to Remain and Soundtrack to your Escape for example, have been met with less than stellar reviews, the influential Gothenburg powerhouse definitely has a very good past. They've got albums that are among Gothenburg metal's finest, albums like Colony and The Jester's Race. The latter in particular, is personally my favourite of the genre. Originally released in 1995, The Jester Race was re-released in 2002 with the Black Inheritance EP added to the run time, increasing the track list by four songs. \n\nAnyone who knows my musical taste, knows that I love melody it my music. And In Flames definitely succeeds in meeting this craving. Every song is extremely melodic, both in the actual sound, and the mood of the music. Guitarists Jesper Stromblad and Glenn Ljungstrom combine their talents to craft beautiful melodies, harmonies, and solos. In this area, the band is not exceedingly aggressive, as a band like Arsis might be, but their main appeal comes from the, again, beautiful sound & structure, as well as the sheer precision in which Jesper and Glenn play. The melodic guitars, which are an important element in The Jester Race, snake their way through the release, and are one of the album's most enjoyable parts. In addition, these sections are enhanced due to the infectious tone on the guitars. Truly amazing and very fun to listen to, if I must remind you yet again.\n\nBut don't be fooled into thinking that The Jester Race is all melody and nothing else. Though it's no Scream Bloody Gore, the album still contains heaviness. Though perhaps largely overshadowed by the extreme melody, there are still aggressive riffs to be found, often holding up the rhythm of the music. The riffing is very well thought out, and does not take away anything from the music, only adding to it. Like the harmonies and leads, the riffing is precise and enjoyable. But the aggressive riffs found in the likes of Dead God in Me and the title track are not the only elements that make up the heaviness of The Jester Race. The brutal death metal growls of frontman Anders Friden definitely add to the heavy mood. Anders has what is arguably his best performance for In Flames. His growls are just as much of an instrument as the guitars. They are very effective and manage to add extra aggression to the music. Anders' performance on In Flames' second full length release is actually one of my favourite performances in the genre, as his technique has a real authority to it, and just has an all around excellent sound to it. Though it isn't as big of a factor as melody, is still find heaviness to be an important part of the band's formula, and an element which they make good use of. \n\nIn Flames is a band that has endured some harsh reviews over the last five years. Whether it is deserved or not is up for debate, but one thing that most can agree with is that The Jester Race is one of the band's top releases, and a classic in the Gothenburg metal scene, if there ever was one. The album contains the perfect dose of melody and aggression in a way that several bands have since attempted, but many have failed to do. The Jester Race is a perfect showing of In Flames' song writing skill, as well as the reason why they were at one time considered an important, innovative Gothenburg metal band. The album, their sophomore effort, is easily an essential metal release, and is definitely worth the money. Do not let albums like Reroute to Remain or Soundtrack to your Escape deter you from purchasing this album, as it definitely belongs in the collection of any metalhead. \n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nGathering footage and highlights from what many consider to be the high point of the band's career, \"Used and Abused: In Live We Trust\" is a pretty wealthy collection of some of In Flames' larger performances, insight from the past 2 years or so of the band's success. Disc 1 mainly focuses on two live shows and a mini-show, while Disc 2 highlights the band's music videos from the Soundtrack to Your Escape album, as well documentaries of the U.S. and worldwide tours following the release of STYE.\n\nThe first show, considered to be the main feature of the DVD, is the band's performance at the Hammersmith in England. Multiple camera angles of the stage and band members let viewers see everything that happens through the show's duration, and do a great job of getting intimate with each member's performance. All of the band members make reasonable use of the stage's large size, and the crowd is ravenous in its reaction to the band's performance, as seen on the vicious circle pit on \"In Search for I.\" By all means, this was a high-profile show, and In Flames went all out for it; all of the members are seen in the signature jumpsuits rather than street clothes, lots of pyro and lighting effects are in use, and there are even gigantic backdrops on each side of the stage resembling Marshall amplifier \"walls\" that bear the band's name. Pretty sweet.\n\nHowever, the size of the venue and ambition behind the show do nothing to overshadow the music. Sound quality on this show is superb, and the band's flawless performance make it all the better. Much of the set list is from the \"Reroute to Remain\" and STYE albums, but two older cuts do make their way in: \"Behind Space\" and the opener, \"Pinball Map.\" The newer outings sound better than they do on album, probably due to the massive live sound and enthusiasm behind the performances. Stage energy is in high form here; Anders works the crowd fairly well during the middle of the set list, and sounds much better hear than on album. (Thank God.) Jesper and Peter both seem a little shy to move, but they're the same way through the entire DVD's duration. Thankfully though, they do more than make up for it the tightness of the show. Daniel's drum work is without mar, and the natural drum sound is a relief from the triggering most bands use. One really cool aspect of this show is the surprise cover of Pantera's \"Fucking Hostile,\" the band's tribute to Dimebag shortly after his death. My personal favorites from this performance are \"The Quiet Place\", \"Touch of Red\", and \"My Sweet Shadow.\" I believe all of these songs were given a good kick in the nuts for the live aspect, and the lighting/pyro helps out as well. \n\nDisc 1's second feature is the Sticky Fingers show. Rather than a large music hall like Hammersmith, In Flames return to a Stockholm club for a homecoming show. Obviously, this show is much more raw and stripped-down than the show I just reviewed; the band stick with street clothes on this show, and there's no backdrop or pyro. It's just a raw performance, but the sound mix is incredibly clear. The club is packed to the brim, and I think that Anders' communication with the crowd is better this time around because of the physical closeness. Camera angles still offer the same intimacy as the Hammersmith, and maybe even more, since the cameramen were right underneath the stage. Due to the sizing down of venues, the band don't have much room to go crazy, but they clearly make the best of the situation.\n\nThere are actually two sets to the Sticky Fingers show: Set 1 is the STYE album played in full, which actually doesn't come off as half-bad. The band are reasonably tight in their performance, but some moments come off as boring. (\"Evil in a Closet\", \"Like You Better Dead\", \"Bottled.\") Likewise, what some considered to be the low points of the album are vicious here, such as \"Superhero of the Computer Rage\" and \"Dead Alone.\" Set 2 spans the band's whole career: 1 song from \"Lunar Strain,\" and two from each subsequent album, except for \"Reroute to Remain.\" The older material has new life to it, and is played with the utmost of proficiency. \n\nThe mini-show is taken from one of the band's largest shows from the 2004 STYE tour. Only two songs are shown, both from the \"Clayman\" album. They sound great, and the band are on an even grander scale than that of the Hammersmith show.\n\nDisc 2's main feature is \"Jester TV,\" a 60-minute documentary archiving the making of music videos and tour experiences. Viewers get a healthy glimpse of the production process behind the videos for \"Touch of Red\" and \"The Quiet Place,\" and get to see some of the band's most memorable moments while being on the road. Interviews with each band member are given, which are only somewhat interesting. Music videos for all of STYE's singles are included, and also a live video from Japan of \"Dial 595-Escape\"; but not the singles from \"Reroute to Remain.\" (Which makes absolutely no sense, if you ask me.) The only exception for RtR is a live video for \"System.\" \n\nThe \"Soundcheck\" portion of Disc 2 is rather useless, and shows the band rehearsing two songs before the 2005 STYE show on Disc 1. Skip it.\n\nOverall, In Flames' first DVD outing is impressive, and has plenty of depth to boot. The performances are great, but Disc 2 seems to drag things down a bit.\n",
        "\nOf the many available titles, I have chosen to review Come Clarity because this appears to be the point in the band's career where they have decided that no matter what they do, they're going to somehow garner even more popularity and appeal to an even larger fanbase of mindless sheep that are eagerly awaiting to eat their shit with a golden spoon... and unremarkably, they've delivered.\n\nI hesitate to label Come Clarity the worst metal album of all time, just as I hesitate to label it the worst album in the band's discography, because either of those conclusions would imply that this album is worse than Reroute to Remain or, say, Soundtrack to Your Escape; two albums which I have developed a striking aversion to and that I believe are equally terrible in their own ways. Come Clarity is awful on an entirely different level though, because while RtR and STYE can possibly be written off as the band \"experimenting\" with different styles, Come Clarity is something of a mammoth accomplishment for In Flames - they have managed to convince many old time fans that the album is a return to form for the band; that it's a stronger In Flames; that they have redeemed themselves.\n\nI am completely fucking baffled.\n\nI'm not going to bother doing a song by song analysis of this shit, because every song is absurdly formulaic and pretty much the same. The formula works on some level, because I actually caught myself tapping my foot on numerous occasions while listening to this, and equally often I felt like I was supposed to be singing along with Anders fucking Frid\u00e9n - who, by the way, sucks here more than he has ever sucked before. His screaming brings to mind the last moments of a rabid ferret as its lungs are methodically ripped out through its throat, and his \"singing\" is on a level of emo that I cannot effectively put into words (which is actually fitting, since the lyrics match).\n\nThe songs are chorus-driven and catchy as hell, but consequently amount to nothing more than really bad riffing, poppy and jumpy guitar melodies, and (as I mentioned earlier) sections where you will literally be compelled to look up the lyrics and start singing along. If this doesn't seem inherently bad, then I remind you that In Flames are considered a melodic death metal band, not a melodic pop-punk band.\n\nA few songs in particular stand out - \n\n\"Leeches\" kind of reminds me of a Machinae Supremacy track for the first 10 seconds or so, which is kind of cool, but it then turns into more or less total shit with a chorus featuring Anders singing \"It burns, it rips, it hurts!\" in a voice of such soaring and majestic magnitude that it shouldn't have any problems serving as the anthem to the listener slitting his wrists.\n\n\"Dead End\" starts off slightly less than completely horrible, and then turns into an Evanescence song, with Anders actually harmonizing with the guest female vocalist in the chorus... I don't think much of it, but I guess it's something new for him. At around the 2:10 mark, the song features a guitar \"solo\" worthy of the poppiest of pop bands.\n\n\"Scream\" starts off with a riff that I think I probably came up with one day when I was around 14 years old, playing around with my first freshly purchased electric guitar in my mom's basement. Seriously, it made me cringe.\n\nThe title track features a bunch of acoustic noodling, Anders singing in a processed and distant voice, and a ridiculously catchy chorus that will probably go down in history as a perfect example of what NOT to do if you're a band that's associated in any way with death metal.\n\n\"Crawl Through Knives\" features a chorus that is... ugh... sounds like the guys found an anti-social high school freshman with sprinkles in his hair to perform guest vocals.\n\nEvery other track is basically some combination of the above tracks.\n\nThe biggest problem that I see with this album is the retarded juxtaposition of several disparate elements that should never, ever, ever be placed together in the same context. Any semblance of a cool riff is consistently destroyed by a sing-along emo chorus. Every attempt at a solo is crushed by the use of poppy melodies ripped straight from a Silverstein album. Every halfway decent roar from Anders is guaranteed to soon be drowned out by something that sounds like Korn's Jonathan Davis. For every good idea, there's something that comes along and completely nullifies it.\n\nAnother problem with this album is the mixing/mastering job. It sucks. Bad. There's audible distortion in several areas, and the whole thing is just loud as fuck. Listening through the entire album is an exercise in monotony.\n\nAnyway, Come Clarity isn't a return to form for In Flames. In many ways, they've actually moved even further away from what originally made them a tolerable band, and I don't see them making any kind of effort to remedy that. This will probably be the last In Flames album I buy... but then again, I said the same thing about Soundtrack to Your Escape.\n\nAll in all, horrible.\n",
        "\n\u201cCome Clarity\u201d has the most wonderful intro I have ever heard of a band like In Flames. It is peaceful and the perfect listen when you want to listen to something calm and relaxing. The song is instrumentally very strong and the acoustic guitar gives the special note to it. \n\nEverything just seemed so perfect until I heard the voice, that should support the wonderful sound of the guitar, for the first time. It was like hearing a cat, which just had been jumped on and trying to scream for help. That was definitely not the sound I was expecting! Luckely after listening to the vocals a few times, I started getting used to the voice and was able to concentrate on the positive things. \n\nThe chorus is a bit stronger and more into the In Flames direction and also from the vocals, the best part of the song. The solo is also high quality, just what we know from the older In Flames pieces.\n\n\u201cOnly for the Weak\u201d is my absolute favourite In Flames song. It has a very good melodic guitar sound, is up-beat and although I\u00b4m not the biggest fan of vocals in In Flames songs, especially not of the screaming, which is often used in the chorus (also here), it\u00b4s not disturbing. It really fits into the mood and lyrics of the song and gives it extra power and a special extraordinary feeling to it.\n\nIn my opinion, these two songs really match and complete eachother. Good quality is offered here.\n",
        "\nWith an astounding second release, In Flames really begins to blaze their own trail in the world of metal. On \u201cSubterranean\u201d, you will hear some of the best melodies in modern death metal. \n\nAt this point, the new Swedish sound was finally coming into its own, with In Flames leading the way, carrying the torch as bearers of some of the most exciting sounds in the underground. \n\nFrom the classically inspired runs of \u201cStand Ablaze\u201d to the crushing weightiness and soaring harmonies of the deeply engaging title track, \u201cSubterranean\u201d defied all expectations, setting a new standard for creativity in extreme music. Equipped with folksy metal harmony, \u201cBiosphere\u201d is an extremely tuneful track that is arranged for the deliverance of maximum force. \n\nDuring this period in the group\u2019s career, fans had already began to catch onto their immense talent, not to mention the fact that the group had one of the most original sounds to be found, an intense combination of furious black metal blasts, distinctly melodic guitar harmonies and song structures which rivaled some of the most acclaimed acts in all of heavy metal. \n\nThis premium re-issue contains the group\u2019s interpretation of Metallica\u2019s \u201cEye Of The Beholder\u201d and Iron Maiden\u2019s classic \u201cMurders In The Rue Morgue\u201d. While the Metallica cover comes off great instrumentally, the vocals are a bit off-key. This fact makes this track an attractive novelty, but nothing close to essential listening. The Maiden track however, is an excellent foray and does much to show where the group\u2019s influences originally stem from. \n\nIf you buy this record for no other reason, you should pick it up for this track alone. Taken as a whole, \u2018Subterranean\u201d was a definite progression for a group that would soon be dominating metal stages around the world.\n",
        "\nLet's face it: regardless of whether or not In Flames could put out something like Cynic's \"Focus,\" metalheads will hate them regardless of it. And since that's out of the way, if you're reading this just to pass time and you hate In Flames with a burning passion, just stop.\n\nIn Flames started out as the main pioneering group behind the Gothenburg movement. Arch Enemy, Hypocrisy and Dark Tranquillity have all had their respective merits, but when someone names themselves as an In Flames fan, you can run their entire discography through your head. \"Yeah man, \"Embody the Invisible\" is a badass track.\" Such albums as \"Whoracle,\" \"Lunar Strain\" and \"Jester Race\" are immediate classics, but were unfortunately tainted by a string of albums with a much more mechanized and less metal sound. Gone were the thick crunches and scandinavian melodic swaggers that embodied In Flames. After \"Reroute To Remain\"(Just a tangent, though: \"Reroute to Remain\" would've been a fantastic album if it were put out by any other band besides In Flames), the music just started to sink further into commercial garbage, which was paramount with \"Soundtrack to Your Escape,\" one of the worst albums ever recorded.\n\nSo, now there's \"Come Clarity,\" a little album no one really anticipated to do much. Yet, I'm hearing the closest thing to a rekindling of aggression that any Gothenburg band(Outside of Dark Tranquillity, they never made a bad album, per se) had made since Hypocrisy's \"Virus\". There's semblances of aggression speckled all over the record, but of course you've got Anders Friden completely shitting on everything with his Killswitch Engage-inspired vocals. Thus part of the 25% knock-off. \n\nThe music is the subject here. \"Come Clarity\" showcases In Flames' best songwriting since \"Clayman.\" They've finally successfully integrated industrialized aspects without sounding like a pop band gone awry, immediately in \"Leeches\" the song has a industrialized beat that plods along with the groove, and actually sounds natural. Other than that, In Flames have finally seemed to've ascertained a sort of direction. \"Reflect the Storm\" is a progressive little tune that's saturated in melody, and comes with some pretty splendid drumwork. \n\nAlso adding to this album's intensity is the production. Bass-heavy and drum-emphatic, the guitars are loud and a bitty muddy whenever it comes to harmonization. A perfect example when dirty production can help an album so much more than shiney, squeaky-clean clear production does. If this album had kept the \"Soundtrack to Your Escape\" production, such heavy songs as \"Scream\" and \"Pacing Death's Trail\" wouldn't have that punch needed to keep In Flames from sounding like a clone of a clone of a clone of their own music. \n\nHowever, don't let \"Come Clarity\" fool you. There's quality material here, of course, but In Flames aren't back up to par with their \"Colony\" game, here. Anders Friden's voice, I don't know how, actually got even more nasally than it was before. Even then, he takes it upon himself to sing every chance he gets. A grown, hairy Swede sounding like a teenage, faggy mall-scene American is not my idea of Metal, but whatever. \"Dead End\" is also another example of lackluster songwriting and commercialism still in the In Flames checking account. It features a duet with some chick singer, and overall, it's the most forgettable track on the entire album. \n\nAt any rate, In Flames get a C for either effort or a major, major fluke. I'd recommend \"Come Clarity\".\n",
        "\nIN FLAMES - COME CLARITY, 2006\n\nI cannot think of a sadder case than In Flames'. Being a successful band, having talented musicians, they proved to be a poorly inspired band early on, since only the first releases, namely \"Lunar Strain\" and \"The Jester Race\" (despite some recent unfair reviews) withstand the proof of time, sounding fresh and versatile after 10 years or so and still continuing to inspire mediocre copycats (nope, don't ask me about \"Whoracle\" or \"Colony\", I just think they are just regurgitated riffs) Now, after having pushed the envelope really hard with their two previous releases, \"Reroute to Remain\", a failed attempt to bring new blood into the band's sound, and \"Soundtrack to your Escape\", the definitive dive into the mainstream and perhaps the weakest, most disappointing album of 2004, they supposedly came back with a new album. Let me tell you something, don't waste your time with \"Come Clarity\", it's only a shallow, shiny skin, whose core is rotten beyond recognition.\n\nI say this is sad because In Flames's musicians are great, I know them capable of great feats, because there are great solos here, maybe one or two worthy riffs and hell, some good melodic choruses. The problem is with the genre itself. Melodic Death should have an infinitely epic reach. Albums like Edge of Sanity's \"Crimson\" prove that flawlessly. Instead, the post-\"Clayman\", post-Soilwork trend consists of chorus-driven, easily listenable rock songs with very poor thrashy riffs, and the ultimate effect is the birth of a boring formula, a balance of three- or four-minute songs which ends up numbing the listener's enjoyment. Maybe the kids will hear it with excitement, but this is really nu-metal with solos. When I heard the first three songs, I said \"Hey, let us give a chance to In Flames, maybe NOW finally they got it.\" but what a terrible mistake I did. They just try to impress the listener, featuring the strong contrast between a chuggy riff and a beatiful melody. There's nothing new in here, just the same thing they did in \"Clayman\", the same catchiness that wore off after just a few listens. \n\nEven if the album is 49 minutes long, you won't see the end of it, since you discover the trick they do over and over again. After the second part of the albums starts, you'll be begging for it to end. The problem is the thrashy riffs, which franlky seem to me as if there were only one unbearable droning with no change at all, with just some moments of peace, but even those calculated and unimaginative (like the title track, \"Come Clarity\", with a good chorus but repetitive, or \"Dead End\"). To me, the worst thing about this album is the obscene complacency, the lack of unforeseeable invention. \n\nThe songs go nowhere, there is no intelligence that could have motivated the right changes in the structures, one can hear how uninspired the band really is: the already spent voice tricks by Anders, the all-too-known riffage, all point to the demise of a style. That's right, Melodic Death is near to its ending. As harsh as it may sound, this current In Flames- and current Soilwork-like blend of music has become a degradation for metal (as abstract and shallow as that may sound). I don't doubt for a second that this album will enlarge the quantity of sold copies but I think the final word is out: In Flames is as good as dead and they would do us a favour by not releasing more albums.\n",
        "\nSomehow it didn't occur to me until later that the vast majority of songs played live on this CD were culled from Soundtrack to Your Escape. This was a big disappointment to me as I first viewed this DVD as a way to hear a lot of their older material. However, most of the songs from Soundtrack are decent I guess.\n\nSince this is a DVD and not a CD, though, I won't talk too much about the music itself and will focus more on the performances of the band and other aspects. Overall, the feeling is very energetic and the shots of teenagers from the crowds are pretty interesting. However, Ander's delivery doesn't sound as harsh and biting live as it does on CD and there aren't enough charming, funny moments that make watching it more than just experiencing the music in visual format. In my opinion, DVDs should capture more of the essence of the band...as a whole and individually. I think more close-up shots of each band member and more personal comments from Anders would be nice...perhaps some jokes here and there.(One particularly memorable part, however, is when Anders announces to the whole crowd that he has to tie his shoe. lol.) Instead, they just plow through track after track, to the point of tedium. I'm not sure how many slow songs In Flames has, but they should've played a few more to contrast with the fast ones. In addition, probably the most well-known 'slow' song In Flames has, Only for the Weak, sounds annoying because the background instrument for the chorus is a synthesizer instead of a guitar.\n\nNow on to the second disc...this is basically just documenting In Flames touring via different modes of transportation in different countries. Most of it seemed to focus on their trip to Japan, which they said they have visited several times. An interesting note about Japan is that most of the people in the front row at concerts are young girls, which isn't very common elsewhere. Heh, someone asked the drummer if any of the members were distracted by that, to which he graciously declined. Anyway, so they keep talking about what they went through to record Soundtrack and mentioning the videos and such, and a couple of the interviewers kept bringing up the question of whether or not there was a video for Evil in a Closet. It was really fucking annoying because this was mentioned several times and every time the drummer or someone else gave some vague answer and shirked it off. Just answer the fucking question. Also, they decided to put in this superfast slideshow of In Flames's experiences in hotels, restaurants, etc. in Japan and it was very nauseating, quite frankly. Thank god I wasn't epileptic and watched that.\n\nWell, overall this is a decent DVD, but it lacks entertainment value beyond the music itself. If I saw the band live, I would just care more about hearing the music I guess, but in the comfort of my dorm or what have you I want a little extra.\n\nNote: I could swear that each time they played Touch of Red the stage turned red.\n",
        "\nGive In Flames credit. Self-crowned leader Anders Friden and his merry band of suddenly hairy troublemakers know how to manipulate their market. After their 2004 release, Soundtrack to Your Escape, divided their fanbase into two very different and very spiteful camps, it would have been the natural inclination of any band to choose one or the other as their main base at the very real risk of completely losing the other.\n\nBut, Friden and company are too clever for such prosaic solutions. Witness their 2006 release, Come Clarity, which somewhat straddles the fence between the melodic sound of early In Flames and the newer thrash that has been their steady goal since Clayman, and promises to keep some members of both sides buying their releases. Replete with vocals that sound as if Jon Davis and Alex Varkatzas had performed some weird fusion ritual and lyrical themes (and artwork) that resurrect those drawings in the notebook by that goth chick who sat beside you in high school ten years ago, this album is best described as slightly less than an hour of juvenile catharsis.\n\nThat should not be misconstrued as to say that Come Clarity is flawless or in any way revolutionary or even memorable. The band has discovered the dreaded \"wall of noise\" production used recently to such unfortunately great commercial success by such acts as Slayer and Chimaira. Apparently, this was decided as much to bury the increasingly simplistic riffs and rhythms within the sonic equivalent of an ocean of molasses as it was for artistic value. The whole of the album is comprised of predictible fast-paced thrash (\"Take This Life,\" \"Reflect the Storm,\" and at least half a dozen other tracks), mid-tempo anthems to angst (\"Leeches,\" the title track, and a number of others), and a spectacularly horrific attempt to recapture the hearts of early fans with \"Dead End.\" Featuring guest female vocals by Lisa Miskovsky, \"Dead End\" is so cynically enterprising that it is a great mystery as to why In Flames isn't already running their own Fortune 500 company and bilking customers out of their money on an even larger scale. Album closer \"Your Bedtime Story is Scaring Everyone\" is every bit a throwaway joke as anything recorded by perennial comedy-thrashers GWAR.\n\nEvery track, though, is tied together by the fact that every instrument and even the vocals are mixed at volumes that differ only by small margins, making efforts to pick out and analyze a specific component only slightly more successful than trying to drill through a brick wall with your nose. It takes a good half-dozen listens to stumble through the impenetrable fog that permeates the sound before the sheer banality of the musicianship becomes apparent. In Flames has come a long way from the days of The Jester Race and Whoracle, but many would argue that they are headed in the wrong direction.\n\nUltimately, Come Clarity succeeds most in making an incredible racket. Full of much growling and gnashing of teeth but lacking any depth or substance, this album is best regarded as a blatant attempt to cash in on the conflict that exists between the two halves of In Flames fan base. The band has raised self-aggrandizement to an art form, something that music has not seen since Metallica's 1990s antics. It's not as if we missed it, either.\n",
        "\nA short collector's EP released to satisfy fans before Whoracle, it contains one track unavailable anywhere else (Goliaths Disarm Their Davids), one song previewing Whoracle that later appeared on it (Gyroscope), an acoustic medley of songs from the Jester Race, and a live version of Behind Space from Lunar Strain. Goliaths Disarm Their Davids is typical folkish melodeath that could have just as easily been on The Jester Race, and is at the same level musically as that album (so it's pretty fucking great). Gyroscope is slightly similar due to the switch off of acoustic and electric, but has overdubbed clean vocals in the chorus, something new at this point for In Flames and they don't sound bad here. On Whoracle Friden's vocals slightly improve, although his attempt at death vocals is never actually good till he gives up and changes his vocal style on Colony. The acoustic medley is beautiful like all In Flames acoustic songs, and the live version of Behind Space is good for fans of live recordings, it's not bad quality, and I'd say that In Flames is just as good live, if not better, than in the studio. Get this packaged with The Jester Race, the stuff here is pretty good.\n",
        "\nSubterranean, in my opinion, is the best In Flames release by far. Problem is, it's just an EP! So what makes it so great? Well, it has the dark and brooding mood of Lunar Strain, but there are some major improvements on this release over Lunar Strain. Although I miss Mikael Stanne's vocals, Henke Forss is very good on this album and I wish they kept him instead of getting Anders Friden. In addition, the drumming here is much better than on Lunar Strain, done by actual drummers (some tracks Daniel Erlandsson of Arch Enemy, others Anders Jivarp of Dark Tranquullity) rather than Jesper overdubbed. The guitar duo of Jesper Stromblad and Glenn Ljungstrom also show off some of their finest work here, showing that they are actually better without a third guitarist. Plus, overall the transitions on Subterranean are much more flowing and natural than on Lunar Strain, where acoustic guitar and violin could basically pop up anywhere at any time. Now, for a song by song breakdown...\n\nStand Ablaze opens up the album (EP) perfectly with a beautiful piano intro leading into some classic melodic riffage. This is possibly my favorite In Flames song guitar-wise, with a really nice lengthy guitar passage at the end that is hardly boring, very melodic, and nice and fast. Everdying starts off rather aggressive compared to the other songs on this EP, eventually building up to a beautiful acoustic passage that fits nicely, then continues and ends with a second acoustic part. The title track, Subterranean, is nothing less than my favorite song of all time, containing a lot of different melodies all crammed into one dark, epic love song. Timeless is one of early In Flames' signature acoustic instrumentals, which of course is great, and Biosphere closes the album (EP) nicely with a great building riff in the beginning, to a rather fast majority of the song with faster, more aggressive leads than In Flames would probably ever use again. But, after that track...it sadly ends and leaves you craving more. I would suggrest buying the remaster, which is almost double the length, but the bonus tracks are a bit awkward and not nearly as good as the meat of Subterranean...here's a review for them anyway.\n\nThe demo version of the Jester Race classic Dead Eternity features Jocke Gothberg of Marduk on vocals, making this version sound a lot like Dimension Zero, with the Stromblad/Ljungstrom guitar duo and him on vocals. Major differences between this and The Jester Race version are the production and the vocals. The production is more raw because it's a demo, which can be both good and bad depending on what you like in your songs. The vocals are more shrieky and in my opinion a lot better than Friden's attempt at death grunts, but could be annoying to some. Overall I like it better though. The Inborn Lifeless, the demo of the track that would be called Dead God in Me on The Jester Race, has slightly different lyrics, different vocals, and again, rawer production. The vocalist on this one is some guy named Per Gyllenback...and personally I think he's nothing special, but again, better than Friden. Some versions of Subterranean also include bonus covers of Murders in the Rue Morgue (Iron Maiden), and Eye of the Beholder (Metallica). Murders in the Rue Morgue is nothing special, but it's cool if you feel like hearing Iron Maiden with death vocals, although that's been done a million times. Eye of the Beholder is an odd one for In Flames, with a session vocalist named Robert Dahn doing CLEAN vocals, and clean vocals nothing like Anders Friden would ever do. It's a good cover, but really doesn't sound anything like In Flames.\n\nOverall, Subterranean is a fucking godly EP, and the remaster is worth getting for some bonus goodies. Plus, it's easier to find than the original.\n",
        "\nThe 1993 In Flames demo is absolutely flawless. It is easy to see why Wrong Again Records begged them for a CD after hearing this, resulting in Lunar Strain. The only reason it gets a 99 and not 100 is because of very small technicalities in songs that are better on the Lunar Strain versions. First, I'm going to start off with the difference between this and Lunar Strain. Firstly, Anders Iwers of Tiamat does some of the guitar harmonies, being replaced by Carl Naslund on Lunar Strain. The songs are all slightly longer, the title track containing a beautiful acoustic intro that was cut, Upon an Oaken Throne has its own odd spooky intro, and Clad in Shadows has an acoustic intro nearly long enough to be its own track. The song In Flames is a beautiful, dark, brooding melodeath masterpiece, and I would go as far to say it is the definition of Gothenburg perfection. The acoustic intro in this version adds to it, but the oddball sampling at the end of what sounds like little kids detracts from the dark mood. In between, the only differences are keyboard in the bridge as opposed to female operatic vocals, and a lack of the scream that opens up the song. I found myself missing these on the demo, but missing the acoustic on the final. Upon an Oaken Throne is a short burst of balanced melody and aggression with some great speedy leads by Iwers nearly identical to the final version, but enhanced by the intro. The acoustic intro to Clad in Shadows is a beautiful little piece leading into another dark In Flames classic. Raw but melodic riffage here with some more great leads by Iwers, and some sort of keyboard or odd guitar overdubbed for just a couple notes (cut from Lunar Strain). Another minor technicality is that the end to Clad in Shadows is not quite as epic as on the Lunar Strain version with the lack of echo, but it's still a great ending to a great demo that leads you very hungry for more. You won't find this anywhere, so get it on the Lunar Strain Remaster.\n",
        "\nReading the reviews here, I've never seen something so widely hated. Hell, even St.Anger is more popular then this album. I was expecting this to be crap, but seeing it in a shop, I thought \"Oh What the hell...\" and bought it. While It was a waste of money, I'm not going to run back to return my copy. It's only slightly worse then the other IF albums out there.\n\nIt's a interesting change for IF, this album, because while it doesn't have their great melodic riffs (the only thing the band had going for it) there's a bit of experimentation, some interesting ideas once in a while. I thought the drums are probably better then in most of the previous albums. They sound fuller and are a bit more up-front, giving this album a bit of momentum in some places.\n\nAnders' vocals are generally loathed in this album, and that's definetly fair enough. His shouted vocals have got progressively worse as the albums go on. They where mediocre in the Jester Race, but now they're just plain horrible. The fairly lame lyrics don't really add much either. But.. And call me crazy for saying this, but I really don't mind his singing vocals. In Dead Alone is a good example of what I talking about. The screaming ruins the verses, but his mumbled, strange voice in the chorus adds something to it. I'm not quite sure If it makes it better.. But it does make it interesting, so I'll give em a few extra points on that.\n\nWell, the drums and the vocals are better then most other IF releases.. so why only 50%? Because the guitars are very very bad indeed. In my humble opinion, the IF sound reached it's peak around Whoracle, and since then the guitars have slowly got worse. There's a few good riffs, like the fairly good opener F(r)iend (Best title ever!) and In Search For I, but for the most part, they're mind-numbingly repetitive, and very boring, nto headbangable, just.. nothing. I would go on about how every chorus sounds EXACTLY the same, but there's not really much point, because all the other reviewers have mentioned it. \n\nSo from an artistic point of view, I don't think this is a bad release. The vocals are \"Interesting\", adding a unique bent with the strange, dementia-riddled mumbling, the synths, while for the most part cheesy, complement the songs well in some parts (the Dead Alone chorus being the best example). I think IF really tried something different on this album, and while it's indeed fairly different, it's also fairly bad, in the fact that the guitars really don't play that many good riffs. SInce the Guitars are the IF focal point, if they where good, this album might get a 70% from me. But instead, they're fairly awful, with a huuuge amount of crappy riffs springy up to surprise. While I wouldn't tell you all to avoid this album like the plague, I wouldn't suggest buying it, unless if you want to round off your IF collection. New fans should check out Whoracle or Jester Race.\n",
        "\nThis is the first album remembered in a discussion about \u201cSwedish melodic death metal\u201d, In Flames\u2019 \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d. It\u2019s hailed as a masterpiece by everyone who listens to it, everyone who reviews it and by the end of the day, it got a lot of more of praise than it truly deserves. It\u2019s not really that amazing.\n\nThe core of this album is, of course, the nice lead/acoustic guitar by Jesper Str\u00f6mblad. In fact, he is the best member of this band. His soloing is, for most part, very nice and beautiful. At his best moments, he could even surpass guitarists like Jon Nodtveidt or the lead guitar player from Soilwork. For example, \u201cMoonshield\u201d. In the lead guitar department, this is one of my favorite songs ever. It starts with a really nice acoustic intro, and then is possessed by some of the nicest leads in the whole world of melodic metal. Although he can\u2019t achieve the same level of success in the other songs, his work is well above average. \u201cJester\u2019s Dance\u201d is one little nice instrumental, which alternates the melodies with \u201cheavy\u201d parts. This song has even a \u201cWasting Love\u201d rip-off riff in the start but oh let\u2019s not get nitpicky. Jesper has a lot of influence here: When something goes bad, he comes to the rescue with some of his leads and solos. The solo on \u201cDecember\u2019s Flower\u201d is indeed great.\n\nOne can also trace a comparison of this album with Agalloch\u2019s The Mantle. Excellent lead guitar, poor rhythm guitar. This is exactly what happens here. Most riffs here are pretty simple, midpaced and without any punch or a decent level of complexity. The guitar tone is not that one we are used to: heavy, grinding. It really makes me wonder why this is called \u201cdeath metal\u201d. When at their best, the riffs are acceptable (\u201cJester\u2019s Dance\u201d). When they suck\u2026 Well, just listen to \u201cWayfaerer\u201d. No need to worry. Whenever the songs start dragging, which happens often, Jasper throws out some sugary melodies, with his over-predominant lead guitar to save everything with his tried-and-true success formula. The album is mostly midtempo, with few exceptions like the nice Dissection-style break at 1:59 of \u201cGraveland\u201d. \u201cDecember\u2019s Flower\u201d and \u201cDead God in Me\u201d also feature some high-speed passages. The occasional good riff tends to pop up, though: The mentioned break in \u201cGraveland\u201d, the diverse \u201cDead Eternity\u201d and some others. The drumming is pretty simple and the vocals are rough, but not straight death metal growls.\n\nI\u2019d choose as highlights the amazing \u201cMoonshield\u201d, \u201cJester\u2019s Dance\u201d, \u201cDecember\u2019s Flower\u201d and \u201cDead God in Me\u201d. The rest is not good enough or mediocre. The only song that truly deserves the title of \u201clike OMG what a motherfucking walking abortion\u201d is the instrumental called \u201cWayfaerer\u201d. Nice talent for writing horrible riffs. \n\nIn the end of the day, this is very overrated. If you really like Gothenburg metal, there\u2019s Soilwork\u2019s \u201cChainheart Machine\u201d, which is much more intense, heavy, faster and has excellent lead guitar work, comparable to Jesper\u2019s, although their styles are somewhat different. Or if you hate Gothenburg, listen to anything by Necrophobic, amazing melodic death metal with a capital motherfucking D. This is just another album that received unfair godlike status.\n",
        "\nThis is supposed to be one of the big Melodic Death Metal masterpieces. But I've come to certain conclusions about this band as well as the Melo\"death\" genre. I've been taking a lot of time to reflect over the quality of this kind of music since \"Reroute To Remain\" came and killed whatever was left of this genre. Anyways, I fail to see how this is a Melodic Death Metal masterpiece since there is no actual Death Metal to be found here. Whether or not it's a masterpiece is up to each listener. This is my view:\n\n\"Colony\" may not be as straight-up annoying as \"Reroute..\" or \"Soundtrack..\" but it sure does fall short in many ways. Anders Frid\u00e9n has always been a lame vocalist and this is no exception. This is where he started his vocal \"experimentation\" and he sure does suck whenever he tries to do harmonies. For instance, there's \"Ordinary Story\" which used to be one of my favourite tracks by any band when I was a metal newbie. Here he goes all clean in the first verse and it just sounds terribly computerized and completely out of key. \n\nAnother beef I have with this particular album is that it's very overproduced. Just like Soilwork's \"Natural Born Chaos\" every sound is totally magnified and might seem like something \"cool\". For instance, we have the intro of track 3, \"Scorn\". This may seem heavy on CD, but performed live it just sounds boring. That's what happens when someone records 589 guitar tracks over eachother. Speaking of \"Scorn\", the vocals on that song are terrible. The patterns seem very close to hiphop and generally feels computerized, once again.\n\nHowever this album has a couple of tracks that doesn't suck. The title-track \"Colony\" is one of In Flames better tracks and is pretty headbangable. \"Embody The Invisible\" also has some good moments between the turd riffs. However, the rest of the tracks are pretty much filler. \"Insipid 2000\" is the only track that offers something of that bunch. Well, at least grabs my attention instead of being a total bore. And two tracks that really piss me off are \"Behind Space '99\" and \"Clad In Shadows '99\". Anders total butchers these songs that were two of their best tracks when Mikael Stanne did the vocals. Those songs used to have some atmosphere on the originals but they're totally converted into modern bullshit in the new versions. Worst idea. Ever. Even by In Flames standards.\n\nI don't get all the worshiping that's going on. This album is pretty mediocre while still being okay by IF standards. \"Colony\" is the only track on here that even resembles greatness.\n",
        "\nI won't be so hard on In Flames for taking their obviously nu-metal route because at least they've done it in a natural fashion while still incorporating tiny bits of their incredible old sound into it. If you liked Reroute to Remain, you will probably like Soundtrack to Your Escape, however it is definately not as good musicwise. \n\nWith each progressive album, In Flames slowly went this more mainstream direction bit by bit. From Lunar Strain to Jester Race to Whoracle to Colony to Clayman to Reroute to this. It is simply impossible to tell that this is the same folk-inspired band that created Lunar Strain. It's quite sad because the band is fully capable of putting out such masterpieces yet chooses not to do so, rather favoring a Slipknotish route. Only traces of the band's talent are left amidst the repetitive songs displayed on Soundtrack to Your Escape. Unfortunately there is absolutely no turning back for In Flames at this point. They are a completely different band than they were and have taken a permanent change in their sound. \n\nThe album begins with the really clever title \"F(r)iend.\" It is a pretty good beginning for the song but doesn't do much to keep your attention. The formula is the generic verse-chorus-verse-chorus etc. formula, similar to a pop song. A lot of people have criticized Anders' scream vocals but I personally think they are better than ever on this album. What really flaws his performance is his newly found nu-metal mumbling/\"clean vocals,\" which are openly shown on the second track \"The Quiet Place.\" The song sounds like a heavier form of Linkin Park without the rapping. I'll have to admit that it is a catchy and addictive song, but nonetheless it is not \"good\" in the true sense of the word. The musicianship is gone, the vocals are whiney, and the songwriting is embarassing compared to Jester Race. The rest of the album continues in a repetitive fashion filled with whiney/clean vocals and lots of similar riffs. Also, Daniel's drumming is laoded with snare that rivals the repition of Lars Ulrich. Fortunately, however, In Flames have the sense to incorporate at least a teensy bit of their old talent into this new sound that is shown on songs such as \"My Sweet Shadow,\" which has a terrific intro, and \"Superhero of the Computer Age,\" which is actually a pretty good song that might even fit on Colony. In Flames still could be writing great albums, but they just seem to choose to write music that will get them more cash. \n\nThe production isn't bad and everything sounds good, more polished than Reroute to Remain. Nothing special yet nothing to bad either, so therefore I can't complain. Unfortunately the production doesn't cover up the lack of ability displayed on Soundtrack to Your Escape. \n\nTo put it all in a nutshell, In Flames have changed for the worse in the eyes of most of their old fans. If you listen to the old stuff and then to this, it seems like two completely different bands from two very different genres that have nothing to do with each other. So, if you don't like this new In Flames, just leave them be and let them make money. Whining about how they turned soft will not do anything but inspire Anders to write more lyrics like \"The Quiet Place.\" I've been a big fan of In Flames for a long time and hearing this is a bit of a disappointment but anyway, there are hundreds of other bands to take In Flames' spot for what they used to do. And hey, In Flames' \"progression\" is definately not as bad as what Soilwork is doing.\n",
        "\nThe debut of In Flames, one of the better Gothenburg bands, is one of those albums that could have ruled completely, as their next album, The Jester Race would, if they had decided to stick with their main ideas; melodic Iron Maiden-esque metal, growled vocals, and some folk influence here and there. Although they always at least somewhat pull this off in all their tracks where they try to pull this off, the album is weakened by two idiotic songs, and the lack of good songwriting in some of their other songs.\n\nThe two idiotic songs are The Everlost Part II and Hargalaten. I mean, Everlost Part II is nice for one or two listens and all, but it really doesn't fit with the rest of the album, and offers nothing. The solo at the end is pretty crappy, and the person singing has a pretty annoying voice. Then there's Hargalaten, a fiddle track. Once again, its a nice little track for a listen or two, but it really is nothing. Why was it included? Stupid stuff.\n\nThe songwriting could also use a bit of work at times. Everlost Part I starts off amazingly as an excellent low tempo song kept together by the vocals; after around the 2:20 seconds, however, the vocals fit less and less with the song, creating a mess. Starforsaken gets into a nice solo at the end that goes nowhere. Dreamscape is a pretty boring instrumental.\n\nOne advantage this has over other In Flames' albums is that Mikael Stanne's vocals completely destroy Anders'. He sounds quite good, and doesn't resort to dumb things like singing clean vocals when you can't sing clean vocals like Anders would shortly be doing. The drums and bass don't do much; the bass is pretty inaudible, and the drums are just there, not doing anything special. But as drums and bass are not the main point of this band, that can be forgiven.\n\nThe main point of this band are the melodic riffs, and man, do they rule. Behind Space is a classic, thanks to Stanne's vocals and Jesper's great riff and solo work. The folkish ending is actually quite nice, and is what makes this the best version of the song (all other versions don't have it.) Lunar Strain is a good straightforward song, with more melodic riffwork. Upon an Oaken Throne is a more fast paced song, with some superb riffage and soloing.\n\nThe true masterpiece of the album, however, is the title track. Holy shit, does this track rule. It is an epic Gothenburg song, and nearly the best song In Flames ever made. The solo isn't anything special, but the riffs are incredible, as well as the way the whole song is crafted. The part that begins right after the two minute mark completely owns me.\n\nThis is an album worth owning if you're a fan of Gothenburg. Its not the best thing the genre put out (that goes to Skydancer and Jester Race) but it does have some great songs. Just skip the filler to get to them.\n",
        "\nWell, the new \"In Flames\" CD Reroute To Remain has landed, and it was only a matter of time before the new single off the album would appear as an EP. Seriously, you didn't see it coming? If you didn't, there is something wrong with you. No offense, but...god...It was kind of easy to spot with the Cloud Connected CD Single released before this one.\n\nThe second major single off of the album, 'Trigger', is receiving massive airplay around the world, and now is your chance to own the 'Single Edit', as well as three bonus tracks, and some visual goodies as well. It's like Halloween all over again! But is it worth as much cash as you have to shell out just to add it to your collection?\n\nHmm...let's all think. 'Trigger (Single Edit)' isn't the actual full length song (obviously). The song is a slightly shorter version of the original. No big loss there, but to a true fan it kind of hurts. Then, you've got the bonus non-album track 'Watch Them Feed', which is just as good a song as any of the tracks off Reroute To Remain. Nothing special here.\n\nHowever, the most interesting part of the EP is the cover of the \"Genesis\" song 'Land Of Confusion'. This track makes the EP, aside from the single and the video tracks, but hey, you'll get tired of the single when it is over played enough. The do the song justice.\n\nAnd then...there were the remixes. These things are more like filler for the album. The 'Cloud Connected (Club Connected Remix)' is actually pretty good, but a bit too mainstream of a remix. And the final track, 'Moonshield (C64 Karaoke Version) sounds like music that would go to an old Nintendo video game, and can get kind of irritating at times.\n\nDon't take it the wrong way though, the EP is great. You get the single, a pretty good non-album track, an amazing cover song, a catchy remix, and a kind of annoying remix that if you just ignore it, it won't go away, but won't be in your minds all day bothering you. And can someone say videos? Both videos for 'Trigger' and 'Cloud Connected' are on here in amazing clarity.\n\nSo, is it really worth the eight dollars plus shipping at certain locations for this EP? Well, it all depends. If you are a die hard \"In Flames\" fan, no price is too high. The EP is packed with good material, but if you aren't really into them, you might want to wait until some kind of holiday or something where people will actually buy it for you. The videos are available on-line if you know where to look, but some of the tracks aren't. To say whether or not you must have it in your collection is more of a call on faith and lineage to the group, and not so much on your wallet.\n",
        "\nIf you are a fan of In Flames, you probably will like this. That is if you like the material from \u201cReroute to Remain\u201d. If you didn\u2019t like RtR, I highly suggest you to stay away from this EP at all costs. For the most part, it\u2019s a single edit, new song, a cover song and 2 remixes. Most of you would probably download this than spend 10$ on it. Anyways, on with the song reviews\n\n1) Trigger (Single Edit) \u2013 I can\u2019t really stand the single edit for some strange reason. The normal version was fine to me, but this one wasn\u2019t that good to me. Sounds mostly techno-ish. If you don\u2019t like the new stuff, you\u2019ll hate this song. 6/10\n\n2) Watch Them Feed \u2013 This is In Flames\u2019 new song they specifically made for the EP. I really liked it. What I thought was unusual about it was that Anders\u2019 had sworn in the song. Aside from that, it\u2019s a pretty good song with a catchy chorus. 8/10\n\n3) Land of Confusion (Genesis Cover) \u2013 I haven\u2019t actually heard the real version of the song, so I can\u2019t say much about it. The song has a pretty good beat, but not much of a good chorus. 7/10\n\n4) Cloud Connected (Club Connected Remix) \u2013 This was surprisingly a good remixed song. It\u2019s got a good beat to it, but not really as good as the original version of \u201cCloud Connected\u201d. The problem with the song that I noticed most of the bass lines were removed, which sucked.\n\n5) Moonshield (C64 Karaoke Version) \u2013 Bah, I did not like this remix at all. Every word in the song was removed, as well as all the guitar, bass and drum fills. Sadly, the vocals were removed to. Horrible remix to a classic song 3/10\n\nOverall, it\u2019s an average EP. Mostly techno sounding metal, well for the most part. There are 2 other things on the EP though. A video of \u201cTrigger\u201d and \u201cCloud Connected\u201d. If you are a good or diehard fan of In Flames\u2019 you will really like this EP. But if you only like In Flames\u2019 old stuff, you will hate this. 67%\n",
        "\nAs soon as I saw that In Flames released a live album, I decided it\u2019d be worth it since mostly all of their material is good to me. For the most part, I was right and wrong at the same time. The only problem I have on this album is the horrible production. The vocals sound horrible (for most of the time) and it has like a stereo sound being constantly played. Anders did a good job on some of the songs, but most of them he screwed up big time. I\u2019ll review some of the songs that I found quite good\u2026 and bad on the album below\n\n2) Embody the Invisible \u2013 This would probably be my third favourite song on the album. The guitar work sounds awesome just like the studio version, but Anders\u2019 vocals are not that good on this one. At first the song sounded like \u201cBullet Ride\u201d to me at first, but then I realised that it was a pretty good song. 8/10\n\n3) Jotun \u2013 They totally screwed this one up. Jesper and Bjorn ended up repeating the pre-chorus part after the chorus. At one point it seemed that Anders had completely forgotten the lyrics for the song. Sounded more like mumbling to me during this one. Horrible quality 4/10\n\n5) Moonshield \u2013 Pretty good for a live track, Anders\u2019 vocals were fine on this song. The only problem I had was that he could have had more of the death metal tone from the studio version of the song. Another thing I noticed that there was no acoustic part at the beginning, which was a shame. But most of all, the crowd sounded completely dead right after the song. 9/10\n\n9) Only for the Weak \u2013 What the hell? The guitar work on this song sounds nothing like the album version. Horrible quality for the most part, Anders sounds like he wasn\u2019t even trying his best on this song. The screaming was horrible, as well as the drums. You can barely even hear them (same goes for the whole album as well). Seems like Jesper and Bjorn decided to use effects for the intro and chorus, which totally screwed up the song. 3/10\n\n11) Scorn \u2013 For some reason I cannot stand this song, so I just skipped it every time I would listen to the CD.\n\n15) Episode 666 \u2013 Good way to finish off the CD. This would probably be the best song on the album, to me that is. Nobody in the band did anything to screw up this classic, thank god for that. Once again, the production quality wasn\u2019t that bad and it had a sort of stereo sound to it.\n\nOverall, the album is good. Don\u2019t try to compare it to Lunar Strain or Whoracle, it\u2019d get crushed easily. The Tokyo Showdown doesn\u2019t match up that good against other live albums, which is a damn shame. Production quality could have been better and as well as the set list. 75%\n",
        "\nSingles suck. That's just it. They fucking do.\n\nThis is a single song, that I normally would find meh.. but when coupled with an, IMO, bad live version of Colony, it just turns to dust. You can't rate these things high when theres only two tracks to rate, and both kind of suck.\n\nThe song starts with a little synth thing... you know it's not going to be like what we heard on Colony, or Lunar Strain, etc etc. Then the bad little riff that's still drowned out by synthe, and then the HORRIBLE vocals kick in...\n\nAnders is now whining. He has downgraded from singing and harsh vox, to straight out whining. Like emo, but with ALMOST ok instrumental work.\n\nWell too bad it's not instrumental, no? This is shit. I'm listening to Insipid 2000 right now now, and I can sure tell you that this sounds nothing like Inisipid or ANY good IF song.\n\nThen the live version of Colony... just no. I'm not going to get started on it. I must be truthful now. I have lost my copy of the song. However even if it was good, it wouldn't matter. A live song will do nothing for this single.\n\nGo buy one of their old albums and steer clear of this.\n",
        "\nHaving been a moderate fan of In Flames, I was looking forward to this when I heard the band say that this was their heaviest material yet. I should have known better, because no band will ever say that they're going to shit when they know it's true. This album is a complete joke. No ifs ands or buts about it. This just sucks.\n\nFrom past albums we know In Flames are able musicians and can make good music, but this is a cop out. What the Hell happened to the harmonized guitars, the solos, the grunts, screams, and most of all, the metal spirit? This album sounds like it's trying to be Slipknot, Mudvayne, and Linkin Park at the same time. Anders' voice sucks now, he doesn't growl or scream, or write good lyrics anymore. There are times he'll try to sound like he's in a hardcore band, by doing a sub par scream and then quickly going to soft and whiney vocals.\n\nBj\u00f6rn and Jesper don't do anything fast or melodic anymore, and Daniel is just boring on the kit. They just play repetitive and weak chunk riffs over and over again, occasionally throwing in a little hint of melody, but not nearly enough to make this album sing! Oh, and the bass...wait, there is no bass, it's hidden underneath the heaps of bullshit known as the guitar riffs, drumming, and singing. Something I never would have expected on this album was the semi-techno sound that In Flames are trying to incorporate into their music. Hell-fucking-o, even little bits of techno don't even mix well with any other kind of music, what makes you think it'll mix well with this subservient shit?\n\nI'll admit, there are a few interesting guitar riffs scattered around the CD. For instance, the first fifteen seconds of \"My Sweet Shadow,\" starts off sounding like they could possibly pull out into an okay melo-death song. After those fifteen seconds, it falls apart to ruin any little bit of metal that is even left in this CD, much less the band. I'm all for trying something new with a band, as long as they can make it sound GOOD; and any ruminants of good sound left the CD when...oh wait, it never did sound good to begin with.\n\nThis album is a complete disgrace and should be avoided at all cost.\n",
        "\nThe album kicks off with Bullet Ride, which opens with a nice riff that gets pulled out and replaced with Anders singing over... from the production my best guess is just bass and drums. And the song is ruined. Is it just me, or does every singer suck live? Not that Anders was all that good in the studio...\n\nEmbody the Invisible is just about the same song as in the Colony album. Nothing special, bad production and vocals.\n\nJotun kicks just about enough ass to make up for the problems on this album. Anders' singing hits just about an all-time low here, but the rest of the band does quite well.\n\nFood For the Gods has about the best vocals on this album. All in all, it's an average song.\n\nMoonshield is an excellent song, but the performance here does not do it justice. The acoustic intro that makes it so powerful is skipped entirely, the aforementioned production screws up the rest of the music, and Anders truly rapes a classic.\n\nClayman is just a shitty song. At one point Anders sounds like he's whining.\n\nSwim is just another song from Clayman. Not nearly as horrible as the crap they've been doing lately, but I always skip it.\n\n\"We're going to take you, all of you, Behind Space! So long!\" CHEESE. The band performs well here, but Anders rapes another classic. At one point Anders sounds like he's got a rabid gerbil in his ass.\n\nOnly For the Weak was about the best song on Clayman, and is performed fairly well here, but asking the audience to \"jump! jump! jump! jump!\" was another unnecessary dose of cheese. Also, the catchy background vocals are skipped entirely.\n\n\"Gee-eye-ro-scope\" is pretty good, but the album version ruins its shit. Get \"Black-Ash Inheritance\" if you want to hear this song done correctly.\n\nJust say no to Scorn. Apparently it can get worse than the album version.\n\nOrdinary Story was much like the album version, just like every other song here from Colony. The usual production and vocal complaints apply.\n\nI skip Pinball Map every time. The only interesting thing about it is that in the negative time before the track it sounds like he calls it \"Pimple Map.\"\n\nFor comments on Colony, see Embody the Invisible and Ordinary Story.\n\nEpisode 666 was actually pretty good. Call me lame, but I got a kick out of the sing-along bits. Not spectacular, and not as good as Jotun, but pretty good.\n",
        "\nForgive me father, because I had sinned. \n\nI actually, in a not so far away past, downloaded some stuff by Korn, and I actually listened to it and said \"it's not so shitty\". But on my redemtion's count I must say that the files rotten in my harddrive until I deleted them when they didn't pass the \"if I don't listen it in two months, and I'm not in the mood of listening when doing the test, goes to the garbage can\". \n\nBut my sin is that I can tolerate nu metal. That's why when I'm not having in mind what In Flames was, I can somewhat enjoy (or bear, or stand, or listen, or... like?) this. In fact it goes better if you just try to forget anything about In Flames' history (except when you look at the last album, maybe, as this one could be in some ways a consequence of the use of the informatic technologies to that one: Select all, copy files, paste files, rename files, and them edit them a bit). So I'll try to make this review from that memory-less point of view because as it isn't fair to tear down a band for the mistakes on it's past, it also isn't fair to bash a band for the splendour of its gone past. \n\nSo going to the music by itself, the guitars sounds kind of dirty, thing that I actually can enjoy even when this use to be a bad way to add weight to forceless guitars. But I can stand dirty guitars as I can stand dirty sex: Not for all the nights, but hey, sometimes it's funny. About the guitars, if this were that unknown band I'm supossing it is, I wouldn't think that it holds two guitar players, because the rythms are all but complicated, and they don't lose too much time making leads beautiful or complicated. I mean, what's the sense of having two guitars if they are all the time doing the same? I remember that a band that I miss the track long time ago released an album called Colony and there one could find even four guitar tracks at some times, two for the rythmic guitar and two for the leading one. I also would like to hear some good solo here and there as I would think that this music would go better with them. But maybe this guitarplayer I don't know isn't a fast one or isn't good finding good solos, who knows. \n\nAbout the drums, they are for me the biggest dissapointment of this album. I don't know if the drummer is recovering from a recent lobotomy or had received drumming lessons by Lars Ulrich, but he sounds like if he only have one leg, most of the times, and problems when moving fast the arms. I bet that even me (EVEN ME!) could think better things to do with a drumkit. \n\nThe bass must be somewhere, missed down between the guitars and the noise they add to them. It can be felt somewhere in the back, underlining at times another rythm melody that one guitar should follow, but other times it just lazily flows with the guitars on their monochord run. \n\nAnd let's face the voice of this guy, Anders Whatever (same name of that guy, Friden). I don't use to have problems with people's voices as long as they aren't Rob Halford's wannabes, with very thight underpants helping their voices go thinner, but well, this guy use to have a strange like to a somewhat disturbing way of singing. At times he uses his clean voice, that speaking politely isn't specially beautiful, and at times he screams with a harsh voice, that sounds high-pitched for me, to be a growl, and that is something that I don't specially like. \n\nAbout the songs, well, some of them (The Quiet Place, for example, even when, incredible, it holds a melody on one guitar!, or Evil in a Closet, even when it briefly holds some acoustical guitars that reminds to old In Flames --yeah, that good sweddish band that dissapeared time ago-- songs, from 0'46'' to 1'08'': over twenty seconds, uau) ask screaming for the next track button to be compulsively pressed, but some others have a hidden good riff here and there. I could be writting similar words, I guess, from the first Korn album. \n\nSo forgive me, but even being a sin if we remind what In Flames was, I don't specially dislike this album, and I tolerate it, and somewhat I even like it. The biggest problem I see with it is that there are thousand of bands that I prefer to listen, better than this, so I think it won't pass the next \"if I don't listen it in two months, and I'm not in the mood of listening when doing the test, goes to the garbage can\" test, wich makes of this an album condemned to hold dust over it and to be forgotten in a dark place.\n",
        "\nI miss the days when In Flames used to make good albums and EP's rather than rehash garbage like this. This is by far the worst EP In Flames has produced. Black Ash Inheritance has the good Goliath's Disarm their Davids and Acoustic Melody and the 5 songs on Subterranean are all around excellent. Unlike Trigger EP however does not have anything on it that makes it a worthwhile purchase.\n\n1. Trigger [Radio Edit]- I absolutely hated this song on RtR so its no surprise I hated it here. The song has an ok maybe 10 seconds or so before it starts to go downhill and just doesn't stop. The pop influenced chorus is absolutely annoying and to make matters worse, the chorus is beat into the ground as about 75% of the song is just the chorus being repeated over and over again with little variation. It's boring, annoying and repetitive. The video that goes along with it is hilarious because there is no way people would actually jump around to this song like they do in the video. The only positive thing I could say about this song is that its cut down in this EP so its over quicker than the album. 1/10\n\n2. Watch Them Feed- A new song. Don't get excited because it sounds like it could fit right on RtR. It starts off with a slipknot-ish riff then some other mallcore-like riff then finally Anders comes on spouting the simplistic the lyrics. More mallcore riffs ensue. Anders comes back on screaming some more simplistic lyrics then shifts over to his weird distorted vocals that were on RtR. The song then shifts to more mallcore riffs then back to Anders distorted vocals and finally breaks out into a chorus which sounds exactly like half of the ones on RtR. A very weak solo follows the chorus and then goes back into Anders distorted vocals followed by the RtR chorus again. After that listeners are then subjected to the mallcore riffs again and the song then thankfully closes out. Overall this song would be mediocre even on RtR. 1/10\n\n3. Land Of Confusion- An interesting song but as with this case interesting doesn't necessarily mean good. The is a cover of a song by Genesis. I never heard the original so I can't comment on how much they butchered it but I can't say I overly enjoyed Anders crappy distorted vocals which are used quite a bit on this track. 0.5/10\n\n4. Club Connected- What the fuck is this? They took the most pop influenced song on RtR and actually turned into a pop techno song. However, even far as pop music goes, this song still sucks. This song would never ever be played at any club anywhere. As much as I hate pop music to listen to, it works good at clubs. This song just wouldn't not work well in a club setting. Anders whiny vocals certainly don't inspire me to start dancing and while there is a semi catchy beat to the song I still wouldn't feel inclined to dance to it. Overall it is a stupid idea exexcuted badly which makes it the all around horrible song which it is. 0.5/10\n\n5. Moonshield (C64 Karaoke Version)- Another moronic idea. Who would ever consider singing a metal song karaoke? Granted its no longer a metal song as they ruined the original song by turning it into some horrible NES song but then that brings up the question, who sings karaoke to damn nintendo music? 0.5/10\nThis EP is just full of stupid ideas. A useless radio edit, a techno remix, and a horrible karaoke song are just wasted space for what could have been good material. Who am I kidding? If they didn't put those on it there would have just been more RtR wannabe songs like Watch them Feed. It would most likely be a lose-lose situation either way. Overall, this EP is a pile of shit. Go buy The Jester Race/Black Ash Inheritance and get some value for your money.\n\nScore 7%\n",
        "\nI heard about this live album after I finally got a chance to see In Flames live back when they toured with Iced Earth and Jag Panzer. I thought they put on a pretty good show when I saw them so I didn't hesitate to pick this album up. Big mistake. The producton is absolutely atrocious. The guitars drown out everything. To make things worse nearly every song has this fuzzy muffled sound to it. In short, some of the bootlegs that float around online sound much better than this official live album. \n\nI'm not going to go through track by track because I'll just end up repeating the same comments over and over like overpowering fuzzy guitars and such. However I make a few notes about certain tracks on the album.\n\n01 Bullet Ride- I don't know what Anders was doing with the opening vocals but he certainly managed to fuck them up pretty bad. The screaming was fairly decent though\n\n06 Clayman -What the hell was with the mallcore screaming around 2:30 that was not in the original song?\n\n08- Behind Space rocks as usual. I just can't mention negative stuff now can I?\n\n12 Ordinary Story- Talk about a train wreck. The opening clean vocals are absolutely awful and borderline in comprehensible. \"here success is written in blood-red colours\" sounds more like \"abrab writ crawlaers\" Around 3:15 or so Anders briefly turns to his new found mallcore screaming.\n\n13 Pinball Map- This song just doesn't sound very good live at all.\n\nThe production just kills this one. Anders also just isn't much a frontman on this album. He lacks energy as he poorly attempts to stir up the crowd. The concert feels like it was a half assed performance from In Flames and the production certainly feels half assed therefore it shall get a half assed score.\n\nOverall 40%\n",
        "\nAnother year another horrible horrible single. This quite possibly one of the worst releases of the year. With the release of this single, we are looking at one of one the most horrible sounds ever produced. One might think this single was originally devised as a method of torture for the North Korean's prisioners of war. If this wasn't the main intent of this single, rest assure it is now.\n\n01. The Quiet Place -You all have heard it. You know how much it sucks. The question is why when there are halfway songs like In Search for I on the album would you ever consider choose using this shit song for a single? I have practically zero guitar experience yet I can produce better sounds just playing random shit on my friend's guitar. The electonics are the best part of the song. I actually don't mind them thrown into music. What I don't like is when its about as close as the song gets to have some sort of melody. Anders continues his repulsive clean vocals as seen on RtR or the latest Korn album. Does actually he think these vocals are good? Seriously, I'd rather be stuck listening to an elementary school orchestra concert than his clean vocals. He might as well be scratching his nails against a chalkboard because that is just as about as pleasing to the ear. This song is not only one of the worst songs by In Flames, it is one of the worst song ever devised by any music artist(s). I think I actually have given this a 3 on my review of STYE. I don't know what I was thinking. It is probably the result of still being hungover from the night before. I can't think of any other rational explaination minus declaring temporary insanity. 1/10 \n\n02. My Sweet Shadow [remix] -They have managed the impossible. In Flames took probably one the crappiest songs on STYE and made 100x worse. Way too much in the way of keyboards and electronic drums. Club Connected on the Trigger EP was atleast catchy, this is a boring techno mix that actually makes The Quiet Place interesting in comparison as if that were possible. I don't know; this is In Flames and they never cease to amaze me whether it was their amazing solos on Lunar Strain through TJR or now have degenerated from genuinely talented band to this mainstream influenced crap. I can't give any points to stuff like this. As giving even 1 point might encourage them to make another one of these remixes. It makes me cringe what might be on the single for their next album. My guess? A hip hop dance remix of their crappiest song on the album where Anders performs a duet with guest vocalist 50 Cent. Hey I wouldn't be surprised. Since IF seems to be copying Korn as of late maybe they'll copy Korn's idea to get a crappy rap artist like Ice Cube to guest star in their music. 0/10 \n\n03. V\u00c4RMLANDSVISAN -Alright not a bad acoustic piece. I really enjoyed it but it was very short clocking around 1:45 seconds. This is the only redeeming song on the single. Unfortunately its doesn't change the fact the other two songs suck and how taking out a lighter and burning your money is actually less of waste of money than buying this single. 7/10 \n\n04. The Quiet Place [video clip]- Oh a stupid video to go along with a stupid song. Anders falls asleep in a move theater and all a sudden he's shown acting like an idiot whole does his little whiney vocals in some dark place. Then it switches over to the whole band in some white room acting like mental patients. Then it switches to the band playing outside with some large blue planet in the background. This part is pretty funny as they look ridiculous as they play. The parts with Svensson playing were particularly amusing. Another note goes to Peter Iwers. What happened to him? He's a big guy but I don't remember him being fat like this. He needs to lay off the cheeseburgers for a while. It closes out with Anders on a griffon acting like more of a tool than he did in the dark room. Anders is a king in his own mind. Where else would masses of people bow to him while he act likes total moron and cries in his whiny voice except maybe a Korn concert. Overall the video fits the music quite nicely in that In Flames went out of their way to make sure this video was just as much of a waste of your time. 1/10 \n\n05. Studio Recording Session [video] -Do I want to see the band sitting around drinking and talking how they made this crappy single? Not really. Save it for the E! channel guys 1/10 \n\n06. Screensaver -It's better than the Clayman one but then again what isn't. The scrolling marquee screensaver that comes with Windows is better. 1/10 \n\nOverall 18% V\u00c4RMLANDSVISAN raises the overall score too much. I really hate to trash In Flames as their earlier material was the stuff that got me into metal in the first place but when you churn out crap like this you have to throw bias aside and be honest.\n",
        "\nAs with the single the Quiet Place, this album ended up as a total disappointment. Perhaps not as terrible as The Quiet Place, but still comes off as quite uninspired and dare I say an intentional commercial effort. Absolutely void of memorable guitar melodies or even the tight rhythm guitar that worked so well up to parts of Reroute To Remain. Even Anders vocals sound much worse and I was never fond of them in the first place at all. If they are going to change their sound entirely why turn into this into a generic bottom of the barrel band with all this synth work(WTF?). I happen to love synthesizers and keyboards too add atmosphere but In Flames are without a doubt the worst I've ever heard at using these. They should have taken a hint from Soilwork's material and made that atmosphere EXTREMELY MINIMAL at most. It is beyond me why they dont just change their name and not disgrace the legend of In Flames. To sell more albums? Best of luck when your name is dragged in the mud by all the older In Flames fans. \n\nOne thing I find upon listening to these tracks is that perhaps In Flames tried too hard too incorporate watered down elements of their older music with this new fascination of making bland music. F(r)iend is a very good example of this. They just don't have it anymore so why bother even trying to half-ass it? It just sounds horrible. If you are going to sellout, go for the gold and just completely re-engineer your sound into a top 15 hit too accessible electro shit (ala Theatre of Tragedy). As much as I hate this album, I cannot say this each piece is entirely horrific. It had a few interesting riffs here and there so if they put some decent leads in, less repetition and tinker with the choruses they might have had a relatively acceptible song structure for starters. Very few decent riffs and barely acceptable rock(not metal) solo's is all this album contained. It doesnt help when every chorus sounds the same either. I wouldnt recommend this album at all. In fact, I wouldnt even recommending CD burning it.\n",
        "\nAnyone with any information of the whereabouts of this band please contact metal fans everywhere immediately. I don't know what this band is doing, but they don't sound a bloody thing like In Flames. On a more serious note, I know there is such a thing as evolving your sound and I respect this as much as the next fan of music but I believe this stretches beyond opinion. In Flames have not evolved their sound into something new and fresh. They went from one of the most interesting melodic death metal bands to a generic version of mainstream nu metal like Korn (vocals) and Linkin Park vocals and music in particular with this song. What is with the electronic intro? Is Anders auditioning for Jon Davis twin brother? Many rhythm guitar riffs on this song even make Reroute To Remain sound like genius. Beyond bland. At least that album sounded more like In Flames despite how mediocre some think it is. The song isnt even that catchy at all. Very sadly the cheesy electronic bits on the intro and chorus(might be done with lead guitar) are the most catchy and interesting parts of the song and they are probably In Flames worst lead part EVER.\"Bow Down, Bow Down\" Reclaim My Place from Korn anyone? Words cant describe the pity I feel for that. \n\nI usually dont like to give negative reviews but my disappointment after hearing this song far exceeds anything I could have ever imagined from In Flames. I feel ashamed to have ever bought any of their albums after hearing this. I recommend this to anyone who prefers not using their own mind in the matter of music and likes to be spoonfed derivative, generic and downright embarassing music. I'm sure some here will think I am being very generous with this review. As far as I'm concerned 40-50 is horrible and 10 is just noise on a guitar! Just to set the record straight.\n",
        "\nI was willing to let Reroute to Remain slide. \"It's just an experimentation,\" I thought. Expanding horizons. It's no Whoracle, but I'll manage.\n\nThis, however, is purely inexcusable. At first, I didn't mind it. However, as the tracks play on... Jon Davis enters my mind. Ew. Korn similarities? What the hell happened here?\n\nFor one, it seems Bjorn and Jesper forgot what a fucking guitar lead was! The harmonies of yore are long gone, replaced by rather montone chugging riffs (cum-chugging, of course). Anders really wasn't much of a screamer, but his feeble attemptsto mix clean vocals and his usual hardcore mockery necessitate his assassination (all the virgins in heaven to whomever kills him first!). There's a few interesting drum patterns scattered about, but for the most part, Daniel's excellent double bass skilled are nauseatingly underutilized. There is also an abundance of keyboard usage on this record, which just gets downright bloody annoying. \n\nIn Flames are the band that got me into Gothenburg; indeed, the band that really got me into metal. While Lunar Strain, Jester Race, and Whoracle shall be forever classics, I believe this album signifies the end for this once mighty group. Drop your axes, gentlemen, and move on, for it is now your career that is up in flames.\n",
        "\nHoly SHIT. Just when we thought In Flames couldn't get any worse, they go off and release this turd. The songs are, for the most part, complete and utter mallcore, almost as bad as St. Anger. In Flames has degenerated into a complete ripoff of Korn. The mp3 says In Flames, but I can't tell the difference between this and a Korn album. Everything about this single sounds like Korn. Even Anders manages to imitate Jon Davis perfectly. Speaking of Anders, his performance on this is HORRIBLE. He whines half the time, and when he isn't whining, he's doing a really weak-sounding scream for no reason other than to sound angst-ridden. And forget about the other instruments, because it's mostly just dropped-D power chord riffs most of the time.\n\nOkay, The Quiet Place. This song pisses me off so much I could actually feel my brain trying to eat itself to be rid of the agony as I dragged my way through this bullshit. The song starts off with a weird sort of melodic intro, and wouldn't you know it, it isn't too bad. But then, the guitars drop down into a mellow droning, just as in any random nu-metal song, and Anders begins his lame whiny whispered angst vocals. The riffs pretty much dissapear behind him, and towards the chorus, Anders of course gives his best mallcore scream to signify the words \"I close my eyes...\" Folks, N*Flamez makes full use of the Standard Formula For Writing A Nu-Metal Song here. I'm not kidding, listen to any random nu-metal song on MTV and it will sound exactly like this, right down to the song structures. Oh yeah, and the chorus is lame and whiny. That's pretty much the whole song, with varying degrees of bad vocals and uninspired riffs thrown around. The lyrics are really fucking terrible, too. God, let it end. Fortunately, it does.\n\nAnd the next song sounds EXACTLY THE FUCKING SAME. I swear to God, the opening riff to Borders And Shading is the exact same one as in The Quiet Place. Then, the guitars drop down into a mellow droning, and Anders starts crying about who knows what, probably slitting his wrists or whatever. Same exact song, different title. Then, a scream, some loud \"riffs\", and more shitty main verses, after which comes a chorus, which is almost identical to the one in the previous song. Fuck, these guys are uncreative. I didn't know it was humanly possible to write lyrics this bad, but there it is. I count precisely one riff. Even Jon Schaffer can write more than that per song! Anyway, more boring riffs with Zakk Wylde-esque squeals inserted to sound \"awesome\", and more of the same. That's two strikes.\n\nThe riff in \"Touch of Red\" is different at least, thank the Gods for that. But the main verses sound the same as always, and the riff is pounded into the ground for the entire song, as always. And it isn't even a good riff. Oh, but wait! A chorus! And it isn't the exact same thing as the previous two, but it still sucks pretty bad. And they repeat it far too often. Also, this is the third of all three riffs on the single that is pissing me off with its repetitiveness. Then the chorus, and Anders ruins even the sucking with the complete cockmongering he calls \"singing\". Thankfully the song is short, or else this would get a nextra two points off.\n\nSo yeah, new N*Flamez is total crap, even worse than Reroute To Remain. I don't know how they managed to write a full album of this, but then I'm amazed they managed to find the studio in the first place. Stay far the fuck away from this if you place any value at all on your sanity. This is worse than Bringer of Crap, and crappier. Fuck you, In Flames. Fuck you.\n",
        "\nThis is the first and only full In Flames album I've heard and I don't care to hear any other of their albums. Sorry, folks, but I don't care for Gothenburg very much and particularly this band. \n\nFirst off, I was sent songs from Reroute to Remain(about 3 or 4 of them) and I was a little mystified, but not moved in any way. I don't see how people were thinking that In Flames had gone nu-metal on RtR because the trademark Gothenburgisms were still there, there was still a little soloing, the vocals weren't too present in the foreground etc. \n\nThe same guy who sent me a few RtR songs also decided to send me the full-length album Clayman, claiming it to be a really solid album. When listening to it, I'm sure I could give testament to that, as nothing really sticks out like a sore thumb on this release(except maybe for the vocals), but generally it's a forgettable release. \n\nSure, many of the choruses are uplifting and the guitar tones are razor-sharp at times, but it all feels too forced and like it was compacted very carefully into this perfect little package that's meant to be just a collection of songs and not moving compositions. \n\nI've always thought of Gothenburg/melodic death metal bands as portraying more than just brutality, expecting high emotional output. It's very comparable to Linkin Park in the way the band seemed to have rushed the production. There is quite a lot of interesting soloing to be found here...nothing truly mindblowing, but blood-boiling nonetheless.\n\nThe vocalist is quite annoying, as his throaty rant is a sorry excuse for death metal vox. It's hard to describe except for the fact that it's mediocre. Soilwork, Callenish Circle, Dead Elizabeth, The Black Dahlia Murder, and others do it better.\nThis disc isn't too bad, but it's nothing truly memorable.\n",
        "\nA long time ago, (actually it was only a year ago) there was a girl who was in search for her first metal album. She went to the local cult music shop (actually it was Sam Goodies.) and asked the kind people there if they could suggest her some fast metal.\n\n\"The latest KoRn has arrived. That is fast, and it's metal.\" Stated one of the workers.\n\n\"No, no, no. I am looking for some real metal!\" The girl exclaimed.\n\nThe worker then handed her a copy of In Flames - \"Cloud Connected\" \n\nThe girl payed for the album, and took it home to listen to it. \"Funny,\" she said to herself \"I thought I asked for real metal?\"\n\nShe was disappointed to find out that the guitars and bass had been drowned out by the synth machine. The song was catchy, but this girl wanted something was heavy guitars, bass, and drums. She thought that if she could block out the annoying synth sounds she could hear the guitars and bass better. No such luck; it didn't help matters either that the drumming and vocals weren't all that great.\n\n\"Bother!\" The girl said as she took out the CD and tossed it somewhere; never to be heard from again.\n\nThe moral of this story? Don't buy In Flames \"Cloud Connected\". The album sounds like nu-metal/emo.\n",
        "\nSo Reroute to Remain may not be an enjoyable In Flames album, but this one is. Like all bands their beginning shows their roots, their influences, their desire to show heavy metal. And so Lunar Strain is one of the best In Flames albums. It has all the elements of good death metal. Growling vocals, harmonized licks, thumping bass slaps, powerful drumming, and awsome fast and mostly palm muted guitar riffs. \n\nThe one thing I don't like about this album is the singer Mikael Stanne. Very different from In Flames next coming albums. The singing is more growly and unprepared, then the In Flames relaxed, yet harsh tones, that come on the future albums. It's not all bad, but sometimes it sounds really bad, like on the song Lunar Strain when the vocals are all muffled. The second thing I didn't like about this album was some of the production. Transition between songs are very poor. You go from a high quality song, to a muffled tone that always isn't enjoyable to the ears. \n\nThe guitar riffs are probably the highlight of this album. With awsome harmonized parts and awsome riffs that sound like real nice licks. Reminds me a lot of Death the way the guitar riffs are all over the place, but with great performance. Best way to see how great the guitar work would be on the instrumental Dreamscape. The stop and go of the instruments is perfect. This isn't some band that jumped into the studio and left within a month. \n\nAll the songs are very killer, with great riffing and awsome effect like the gong sound in the beginning of Dreamscape and the perfect ambient sounds that open up this album on Behind Space. They even host a female singer on Everlost Part 2 who is really good. The acroustic riff is also a very nice melodic tone to the album. Did I mention there are fiddles! Yep beginning of Hargalaten they give the song an awsome feeling of greatness, a great way to mix up an album. In Flames, the next song is the highlight of this album, with everything shinning out perfectly. Everything comes out on this album. I don't care much for this In Flames singer, and the production may be a little sloppy, but besides that it is a very great album that all metal heads should own!\n",
        "\nI don't hear anything wrong in this album. Sure, there are less solos and a couple \"nu-metal\" riffs, but I don't see this as selling out. Every band that's been around for atleast ten years in existance is doomed to make an album that will dissapoint a fan. Bands lose fans either because of medicore albums that sound the same or if they try something new in their sound.\n\nIn this case, In Flames tried something new. I see that as a good thing because I'm already sick of seeing all these lame generic gotheburg metal bands that have been coming out latley, so many unoriginal In Flames and At The Gates clones, it makes me glad In Flames didn't get lost in the herd of their own followers. They managed to evolve their sound (I know some metalheads will laugh that statement here), but it's true, they don' have that primative gothenburg thrash sound and all the songs can be enjoyed by adults. Lets face it, majority of grown people won't want to listen to dark music. Older people want a more mature melodic sound and In Flames matured their songcraft.\n\nIn Flames managed to make a refreshing album. The keyboards, although not complex, is a nice ingredient In Flames used in their latest recipe. There's also more singing than growls. I wasn't impressed by the singing but it works in their new sound, complimenting the not really heavy music.\n\nTransparent is a song that has the nu-metal riffs, but it still manages to come up with a catchy hook, I don't think a nu-metal band could even pull that off. There's also a solo towards the end of the song, so solos are not extinct on the album, just used spairingly.\n\nThe best song In Flames ever did here is Egonomic. The chorus is just so catchy, it's one those epic type songs. Egonomic is the greatest achivement on the whole CD. I don't care what anyone says, I find the song perfect from begining to end and I find it much more better than some of their older songs before Whoracle.\n\nI'll admit, the slower songs that are focused more on regular singing are too bland. It's like the singer is talking in his sleep. That's the only real drawback here. The songs Egonomic and Transparent make up for the negative aspects of the album so all is not lost at all.\n\nAfter hearing this album, I'm really looking forward to hear what In Flames has up next. Yeah, they're getting popular, so what? I know underground bands that suck worse and I doubt In Flames changing so drastically to sell records that you'd find them number one on the American Billboards.\n",
        "\nThe new Trigger EP, is nothing short of Reroute to Remain. Of what I've heard from Reroute to Remain, this stuff is very similar. It has its ups and downs, as Reroute to Remain did. Since it is an EP, I'll give a song by song analysis.\n\nTrigger- Trigger is featured on Reroute to Remain. This song has good quailites and bad qualities. It starts off with an amazing drum beat, which lasts throughout the whole song. The riff is your typical In Flames sounding. But then the vocals come in. You can't really hear them at first, but when they come in clear, you will start to headbang. During the chorus the singing is clean (not growled vocals). Even though this is kind of different from the In Flames scene, it's not really too bad. When the vocals are very hearable, with that mallcorish type of distorted vocals...yeah that kind of ruins the song. They could have dropped that part out, and instead play the chorus two times. That way the song would not be so repeditive.\n\nWatch Them Feed- This is the new song on the EP. Overall it's not to bad. It has more of the Clayman type sound to it. Fast drumming (most of the time constant beating on the snare, with the occasional fill). The riffs are pretty fast and blazing. The chrous slows down the song, and the vocals kind of suck at this part. However, there is a neat solo (or lick) that makes the song all worth it. Still it has the Reroute sound to it at times, while other times it sounds like it came off of Clayman.\n\nLand Of Confusion- This song is definetly different from any In Flames I have ever heard. Probably because it is a Genesis cover. It starts off heavy, then it has the drums and singer play, then the guitar riff plays. It's okay, just different. The chorus totally blows (vocal wise). The vocals are once again distorted (sounds like he is singing in a phone or something).\n\nCloud Connected- This also comes off of Reroute to Remain. For the most part the vocals suck, especially during the main verse. They are distorted and well...there hardly hearable. It has more of a feal good feeling to it. It also has a lot of techno sounds and beats to it. Not usual In Flames, but not necessarily awful. \n\nMoonshield- If there is any great song on this album it would have to be this one. Hahaha! It's actually funny. It is a karaoke version of the In Flames song Moonshield. So you can sing along to it. However instead of using guitars and the such, it's all put through a keyboard (at least it sounds that way). It sounds a lot like a song you would hear on a video game. Excellent song!\n\nOverall, this album isn't worth it. Basically, if you like Reroute to Remain, you will enjoy this EP. The songs, while not being classic In Flames material, are nonetheless horrible then the album Reroute to Remain. I would pick it up for the cool version of Moonshield let alone!\n",
        "\nOf course, what metal band does not have a live album from Japan? Honestly, whats so great about Japan. Anyways, this album has its good moments and it has its bad moments. If your not really into In Flames, such as myself, this album is good to get, because they have most of their classic hits from the albums Clayman, Whoracle, Colony, and The Jester Race. Most metal bands, or any bands for that matter, decide to come out with a live album. I have one question for these guys: Did they have a producer for this album or did they produce it on their own mics and stuff? The guitars are really good. Nice riffs and definetly nice harmonizing (check out Moonshield). The vocals are pretty good too, but sometimes it is hard to hear them. Did they mic the drums? It is hard to hear all the other instruments. The guitars basical drain out all the other instruments. The only song I think they don't drain out is on Only For The Weak, which is a pretty kick ass song. On this song you can even hear the keyboards. The guitars drain out the vocals for most of the time! Man, this is a worse nightmare for bands with live albums. But besides the crappy production this album isn't all that bad! Great songs if you have the patience to listen deep past the guitars and to all the other stuff!\n",
        "\nOkay, so what we have here is the latest crapsterpiece from perpetual suckage vortex In Flames.\n\nWe actually start off pretty promisingly... for the first minute, the first song is total fucking \"Walls of Jericho\" worship. Nice riffs, great lead guitar going, total speed metal going...\n\nthen they realise they're a Geighthenburg band. It's a very up and down song - some decent riffs, but then there is that really shitty under-verse riff. Make up your mind. In the immortal words of Slayer... DO YOU WANT TO SUCK!??! \n\nThe next song, \"System\", is faster for a bit, then gets into a really sickly decrepitly awful interlude. Then we have \"Drifter\", more of the same crap - the halfthrash riff under the verses is really grating, then a really great break. It's like, make up your mind. Each song seems to have its good parts and its bad parts, can't you be GOOD for an entire song?\n\nThen, in \"Trigger\" we get a more typical Geightenburg song - the distorted Maiden melodies being repeated over and over again over a barrage of distorted riffs, that's the typical crap intro, and then of course the shit interludes. The album really has some nice riff ideas going, but the way they are connected... what the fuck? \n\n\"Dawn of a New Day\" is a fucking disaster, I won't even get into it. Whiny mallcore shit. How can anyone say this album is devoid of the modern shitfuck elements that make \"music\" so unbearable sometimes? That song right there represents everything that is wrong with society today. \n\n\"Egonomic\" oh look a decent opening riff that just goes nowhere, but at least the song is fast. It sounds like a rejected Tyran Pace song, with the wrong vocal track applied. Meh, I've covered every idea on here so far. Typical Geightenburg shit, mallcore shit, rejected halfthrash riffs, there really isn't much going for this album. Other than the first forty seconds of the first track...\n\nSo what we have in here is some decent riffs, combined with some of the crappiest, most grating ideas ever. The songs lack cohesion - just disparate ideas thrown together haphazardly.\n\nThat, and the kinda shrieky pseudo-death vocals just don't make SENSE on a power metal album. Not that I like the \"clean\" vocals better. Take some pills for your fucking stomachace - some CYANIDE PILLS. I sentence you to be assraped by Jonathan Davis!! \n\nIn here buried is a nice classic metal album, it just happens to be 6 minutes long, when you take out all the stupid shit. Why, oh why, must bands like this be allowed to exist? This takes the worst of heavy metal (Geightenburg) and combines the worst of modern music (mallcore) creating a real fucking disaster.\n"
