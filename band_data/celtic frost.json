        "\nIt always fascinates me how quickly the musical ideas and visions of certain artists change over time. Who\u2019d be a better example than Tom Warrior himself? During his abrasive Hellhammer years, he wrote some of the most sinister metal tunes ever, whereas Celtic Frost\u2019s sound has progressed, regressed and even took some unexpected turns with shocking results. Generally, Into the Pandemonium reveals Celtic Frost\u2019s first step into the realm of avant-garde weirdness, but I consider To Mega Therion to be the band\u2019s first artistic record. With gargantuan songs that feature poetic lyrics and convey a wide scope of vivid imagery, Tom\u2019s grimmest days were certainly over, yet the metallic edge was still extremely evident at this point.\n\nAfter the grand introduction of \u2018\u2019Innocence and Wrath\u2019\u2019, To Mega Therion quickly morphs you into the creative realm of Tom Warrior and company. Back then, Tom Warrior stuck to a rough-throated bellow that made him sound like a (dethroned) emperor and while his roar sounds far cooler than the moan that he'd introduce in years to come, I\u2019ll admit that I find his performance to be a bit too one dimensional and restrained at times. In fact, I miss that maniacal side of him that was extremely present during his short-lived Hellhammer years; when he\u2019d scream, groan and roar like a possessed maniac whose only interest came down to beating Venom at their own game. Besides Warrior\u2019s trademark roars, you\u2019ve got the occasional reedy female vocals and while I approve of them on paper, they\u2019re not so fantastic either. Rather goofy than angelic, (think of Fenriz\u2019s \u2018\u2019female\u2019\u2019 vocals on Goatlord and you\u2019re not far off), this \u2018\u2019beauty and the beast\u2019\u2019 trade-off wouldn't start to work out until some years later. Fortunately, the instrumental side of To Mega Therion certainly makes up for the less-impressive vocals; French horns provide a sense of arcane majesty and best of all are these groaning riffs that highlight how much of a distinctive guitar player Tom was at one point. Sure, you don\u2019t need a PhD to play along to these simplistic riffs, but tracks like \u2018\u2019The Usurper\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Jewel Throne\u2019\u2019 instantly blow off the roofs with their spiking riff-gaze, while crushing monoliths like \u2018\u2019Dawn of Megiddo\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Necromantical Screams\u2019\u2019 reveal the epic side of To Mega Therion.\n\nIt\u2019s also no wonder plenty of death, black and doom/death metal bands have been inspired by To Mega Therion, as this record has so many unique ingredients in store; such as these slow-burning grooves that would be expanded by Obituary, sledgehammering riffs that would make the Darkthrone crew jump with joy and beauty and the beast trade-off that Paradise Lost would played around with (fun fact: Martin E. Ain loved Gothic and liked the idea of having taking that direction with Celtic Frost itself). If you ask me, plenty of later bands would take Celtic Frost\u2019s sound to a whole next level with far superior results and in this band's case, not every track works as well as it should. Certain arrangements of To Mega Therion sound somewhat off. Slower sections of \u2018\u2019Circle of the Tyrants\u2019\u2019 make somewhat of a dragging experience, whereas \u2018\u2019(Beyond) the North Winds\u2019' becomes a strange experience because of Tom Warrior's rushed vocal lines.\n\nStill, none of the record\u2019s flaws bother me as much as the flaws of their later albums would. From the quirky Into the Pandemonium, to the laughable sell-out that Cold Lake represented, to the endless snooze-sludge of Monotheist, Celtic Frost would quickly become too much of an unstable band for their own good (you might have noticed that I\u2019ve left out Vanity/Nemesis, but did anyone actually care once that one saw the light of day?). Indeed, To Mega Therion is the last Celtic Frost album of interest to me. Sure, it\u2019s not perfect\u2026but like most things in life, it doesn\u2019t have to be. \n\nThis review was originally written for antichristmagazine.com\n",
        "\nIs Prototype a good Celtic Frost album? No. It is really even a Celtic Frost album? Because, I thought it was a demo.\n\nThe reason I mention this, is because this wasn't meant to be released. It doesn't even have real drums. The album is a mix of different ideas, and no, not all of them are good. Some are pretty bad.\n\nThere's a Beatles cover, which is mostly electronic stuff. Tom Warrior isn't good at singing vocals, and here, he isn't trying. His glam vocals were better. There's some other, industrial sounding stuff, and a minimalist rap song, with whiny vocals. The interesting one, is, of course, \"Hip Hop Jugend.\" I feel that it's not fair, for me to judge it, too harshly, because it's a rap song, and I don't speak the language it's in. I can make out a few things, including the chorus' Mozart reference, which is to his song \"Leck mich im Arsch.\" What I will judge, is that Tom Warrior's horny industrial music is bad, and was probably something he made for a laugh(if you want to see a serious rap version, of \"Leck mich im Arsch,\" Jack White made one, with Insane Clown Posse, which I don't recommend).\n\nA lot of the album is metal, however. Although, it's pretty groove, or nu metal. Some of these songs became real Celtic Frost or Triptykon songs. \"The Dying I\" is one, which later appeared on Monotheist, as one of the lighter, gothic songs. Here, it's a nu metal song, and a pretty good one. Obviously, Monotheist is a vastly better album. But I would mosh to this version, if I heard it live.It's fun and stupid, like drinking alcohol, and listening to Pantera. I like that both versions exist.\n\nThe rest, could make some really good groove metal songs, if Tom weren't trying to sing. At one point, he tries to sing, like Layne Staley, and it doesn't work, because he simply cannot sing. \"Human Dirt\" was, at least, catchy enough, that I found myself singing it, to myself, at work. The problem, is that Tom isn't playing to his strengths. His primitive riffs, and distinctive style of playing them, aren't really present here. The good nu metal bands have minimalistic riffs, but add variety, through guitar noises, rhythm changes, and vocal dynamics. All of which, aren't getting much use here.\n\nI've given this such a high score, because the songwriting has the beginnings, of turning into good songs. If this stuff had gotten a real release, I have no doubt that it would've been much better. But I can't score it that high, because, as it is, this is all we have, and is not very good. Still, I would be interested in hearing a Tom Warrior rap album, if he ever chooses to make one.\n",
        "\nWhat a legendary band Celtic Frost was. It emerged among the originators of extreme metal, yet it quickly became a one of the first experimental bands in the metal circles. \"Into the Pandemonium\" is rightfully considered by many as a one of the earliest avant-garde metal records. Of course, it's not that avant-garde by the modern standards, but back in 1987 it demonstrated the extremely specific eclectics. Interestingly, many conservative metal enthusiasts fail to understand \"Into the Pandemonium\" even today.\n\nThe album starts straightly with a \"shocker\", a metalized cover of the new wave composition \"Mexican Radio\" by Wall of Voodoo. Still, it's possible to recognize Tom Warrior's voice and riffing approach. There are more features of the traditional Celtic Frost. The likes of \"Inner Sanctum\" and \"Babylon Fell\" could have been easily put on \"To Mega Therion\", as they don't cross the thrash metal borders. However, those are the only tracks, which majorly remain to be traditional Celtic Frost.\n\n\"Mesmerized\" and \"Sorrows of the Moon\" are psychedelic and depressive, influenced by gothic rock/post-punk. Fischer performs vocals in a mournful and ethereal style, which is also a quite gothic feature. The role of an acoustic guitar is important there. \"Caress into Oblivion\" resembles \"Inner Sanctum\" and \"Babylon Fell\" in terms of style and structure, but there are a lot of ethereal vocals like on \"Mesmerized\" and \"Sorrows of the Moon\".\n\nThe experimental nature of the album goes beyond the gothic vibes. \"One in their Pride\" is a post-industrial interlude with an awkward urban atmosphere. \"I Won't Dance\" is so catchy and energetic, that it should have been called \"I Will Dance\" instead. Then the album concludes with \"Rex Irae (Requiem)\" and \"Oriental Masquerade\", where Celtic Frost presents symphonic metal. The orchestral style of these compositions settles epic and tragic mood.\n\nThus, \"Into the Pandemonium\" mixed thrash metal with gothic rock, post-punk, symphonic and orchestral music. Today people would have labeled the album as thrash / gothic / symphonic metal, but obviously it couldn't be perceived this way in 1987. \"Into the Pandemonium\" deserved the avant-garde status with its extremely innovative eclectics by the standards of 1987. Apart from innovation, influence and other stuff, \"Into the Pandemonium\" is just a genuinely interesting work to listen to, memorable without a doubt.\n",
        "\nIn 1814 / 1815, the \u201cWiener Congress\u201d gave Europe a new structure after the overdue fall of Napoleon. One of its results was the eternal neutrality of Switzerland. 187 years later, mankind realized how fantastic this Swiss status is. Otherwise the export of just one of the 30 copies of Celtic Frost\u2019s \u201cPrototype\u201d would have caused World War III, no doubt about it. Everyone with just a small interest in history knows that there had been already bloody wars for less reasons. \n\nA review should describe the respective release, that\u2019s for sure. But how to describe something the English language has no words for? And that\u2019s not to say our British friends should expand their vocabulary. Every other language would definitely fail as well in view of this totally horrible, overdimensioned pile of shit. Already the first two songs have absolutely nothing in common with metal. Reduced to the non-essential, the trio (seemingly gone haywire) plays a cover version of \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d and John Lennon makes the experience of a post mortem rape. Unbelievable, but the second \u201csong\u201d is even worse. \u201cTotgetanzt\u201d \u2013 electro beats, whispered vocals and clapping hands worship the unmusical God of stupidity and the fragment of the fragment of the \u201cDanse Macabre\u201d tones wants to be understand as a melody. Give me a bucket, I must puke. I mean, one can do such \u201cmusic\u201d, why not, everybody blames themselves as good as possible. But why did Tom and Martin (R.I.P.) do this under the Frost banner? Icon suicide! \n\nEverything is terrible here. The Rammstein influenced \u201cHip Hop Jugend\u201d has not much in common with hip hop and that\u2019s the best thing I can say about this embarrassing document of false ambitions. Senseless lyrics, staccato shouts and, naturally, electronic drumming \u2013 maybe a good song for the lost souls on the dance floors of clubs I never visited, but totally nonsensical in the context of any kind of heavy metal. But the worst is yet to come \u2013 even if they want to perform metallic tunes, everything sounds terribly bad, lame and repetitive. \u201cThe Dying I\u201d or \u201cNovember\u201d (additionally killed by female guest vocals) prove that weak sequences do not become better by repetition. But who cares? Celtic Frost play the same lines again and again until the doctor comes. Wasted effort \u2013 here is nothing left to be saved. It\u2019s just amazing to see that one can repeat a line a hundred times without creating the smallest iota of catchiness.\n\nAnd so the caricature of a once excellent band stumbles through the most perverted fields of creativity, adding an orchestral part without rhyme or reason or creating noise every street musician would be shot for. \u201cRelinquished Body\u201d alone justifies the most severe measures. But okay, let\u2019s try to find some more objective words at the end. Perhaps it was in the DNA of the Fischer and Ain to shock the audience at all costs (and this idea alone justifies a rating higher than 0%). Hellhammer wanted to devastate the cosy Switzerland, now it was time to kill their last followers. Too bad that did not pursue their goal consequently \u2013 \u201cPrototype\u201d was never officially released. This is the best one can say about a demo that really hurts.\n",
        "\nOk, so this is Celtic Frost, thrash/black metal legends, and there's a track that literally sounds like a Crystal Method song that would've played in a nightclub in 1998. This release is the strangest and most experimental/unique album of the 80's. I personally love this album very much, but with such experimentation and willingness to break the mold of what extreme metal was in the mid to late 80's, there are some flaws. The version I've chosen, the 2017 Noise Records Reissue even has a cover of a Dean Martin song that they did during the recordings of this record. When it comes to the beginnings of the progressive, or more aptly named \"Avant-Garde\" metal genres, I'd point to this as a key release in that evolution in metal's history. I can't even begin to imagine hearing something as sonically strange and contrasting to the metal scene as this, but what also strikes me is how well Celtic Frost incorporates their sound into this fusion of ideas and genres. So let's get into what this beast of an album is, what it excels in, and what ideas that can only be described as commendable efforts that lack proper execution. Let's head Into The Pandemonium.\n\nImagine starting your LP with a cover! Well they don't have to imagine it, as they cover the Wall of Voodoo hit single track from 1982, \"Mexican Radio\" ok, despite questioning the reasoning behind them covering it we all know the Celtic Frost version is better, because it's straight forward thrash madness, but it still has some doltish moments to say the least, much like the original song. It's a song I like, but could do with or without. The next songs besides Mesmerized are abnormal to say the least. The only songs on the album that are pure \"Celtic Frost\" are Mesmerized and \"Babylon Fell\". Everything else has Tom singing in quite the odd singing voice, sometimes I like it because it sounds emotional, sometimes I hate it because it sounds like he's getting special services below the waist. There are just some strange and non metal songs altogether, for example the number known as, \"Tristesses de la Lune\" which is sung by a woman named Man\u00fc Moan from The Vyllies, which was a dark gothic band from Switzerland. The track is completely in French, it's mostly an orchestral piece with some guitars sometimes being played. The track that joins that one in abnormality is \"One in Their Pride- Porthole Mix\" Whatever that means. This sounds like club music, alike in sound to The Crystal Method. I don't see the point, this track just seems pretentious, and sometimes the album as a whole can feel that way. Good thing that the execution of ideas actually working overshadows some of the pretentiousness. \"I Won't Dance\" and \"Rex Irae\" are tracks I enjoy, but the last two original songs suck because it's just slow riffs and Tom doing that whiny singing voice horribly. The Dean Martin cover is good, but again, why? Often I feel like covers of completely different styles of music either work or are complete and utter failures. Celtic Frost makes it work, much like Coroner did when they did \"Purple Haze\" by Jimi Hendrix and \"She's So Heavy\" by the Beatles. Nuclear Assault failed. Really? Ballroom Blitz? I'd rather not. Lastly, the bonus tracks, a remix of One in Their Pride with noticeably more reverb, and The Inevitable Factor with a different vox, which I like better because it's just Tom's classic singing and not him jerking off or whatever was happening on the original. The production is pretty good as well, so let's talk about that\n\nThe guitar tone, drums, and bass are classic Celtic Frost production. Everything sounds good, maybe not as good as To Mega Therion, but similar enough to where that's a good point of comparison for this release. The focal point of production here, is how well they implemented all the different and strange effects and instruments in the mix. Really, I have few, if any complains about the production. Maybe one thing I didn't like is how weak the timpani sounded when used. I played a timpani one time, and I know that thing is not that quiet, good lord. Could be my headphones as well, as repeated listens of Asphyx have damaged them. The incorporation of keyboards, and other symphonic effects were recorded well. Tom's \"soft\" vocals are always muffled, which I don't like at all, they should be easier to hear. His normal vocals are just fine, and they sound great as always. The vocals that were recorded just as well as Tom's were the backing vocals on \"I Don't Dance\" and Man\u00fc's on \"Tristesses de la Lune\" of course, I'm sure clean vocals aren't so difficult to record and mix, but I have to compliment them as being good because they aren't muffled and all that nonsense. All in all the production serves the record well for both purposes, the avant-garde areas, and the Celtic Frost black/thrash areas.\n\nSo all in all this record has some great strong moments, and some strangeness. I have to deduct points for starting and album with a cover, that's just something I don't think anyone should do. The other cover on the album is at the end, and \"Mexican Radio\" should be there as well. The tracks that have Tom singing cleanly are always pretty good instrumentally, but are hit and miss vocally. Either Tom sounds mysterious and emotional, or sounds like he's being pleasured, so some points off for that for sure. The pure Celtic Frost songs keep this release great as well, and even the tracks that are intense while incorporating weirdness work very well. The last two things I have to deduct points for is the pre-Crystal Method, Crystal Method song and the pointless Oriental Masquerade. So even though this album has a 78, it still has some strong moments, but good lord you have to put up with some very flawed and poorly executed ideas in the process. I definitely recommend listening if you have the desire to be confused in good and bad ways. Definitely and album well ahead of the time. Think about in the context of 1987 when you listen. Enjoy! Or don't.\n\n-Nolan\n",
        "\nI know the Celtic Frost community is going to hate me for this, but let me explain. Celtic Frost was a very important band during the first wave black metal scene in the 80s, with projects like \"Morbid Tales\" and \"To Mega Therion\" pioneering the distorted sound and dark imagery black metal is known for today. So fans were shocked when in 1988, the band members decided to get rid of the black metal sound altogether in exchange for a heavy/glam metal style for their third album \"Cold Lake\". The criticism was brutal, and it caused the band to disown the album from its future catalogue. Even Thomas Gabriel hated it, as he called it \"an utter piece of shit and possibly the worst album ever created in heavy music.\"\n\nBut now that the controversy has died down, the album has gained a cult following in recent years. I personally didn't like the album when I first listened to it, but the more I listened to it, the more I started to appreciate the positives in the album. Now I still don't consider this as great as \"To Mega Therion\", and it is still their weakest album in their discography, but when you put all the sell-out controversy aside and focus strictly on the music, you'll find a lot to like on this album.\n\nOne notable thing about \"Cold Lake\" is the instruments. Now as I said earlier, this is a heavy/glam metal album, so the instruments are significantly toned down and the production is more cleaner and polished. But as far as glam metal albums go, the instrumentation is great. The guitars still maintain a dark sound, but balances it well with the more bouncy riffs. The drums also beat with more vibrance than other glam metal albums, so they beat in more coherent patterns. The bass is also more audible than many other albums at the time and follows the guitars very well. My favorite instruments comes from the tracks \"Seduce Me Tonight\", \"Cherry Orchard\", and \"Downtown Hanoi\" since the guitar riffs on those tracks are diverse and bring in more of an edge on the track, giving the atmosphere a more sinister tone. While some tracks like \"Little Velvet\" have bland and generic instruments, the instrumentations on this album are good overall.\n\nAs for the vocals, they are decent aswell. Thomas Gabriel's vocals on the previous two albums were great, but he tones them down a bit on this album. His voice has less screaming, but offers more melodic singing and chants than in previous works. One of his best vocal moments is in the track \"Dance Sleazy\". On that track, Thomas's singing flows with the groovy instruments well and it gives him a more playful personality. His voice also has more might on that track than in other songs, so they bring in a more powerful sound in them. Of course, being a glam metal album means that he has to have one poor vocal performance, and \"Juices Like Wine\" has Thomas whine the chorus, which sounds awful. Nevertheless, Gabriel's vocals still hold up well, even though there are a few slip ups in his voice.\n\nBut one problem with \"Cold Lake\" is the lyrics. Glam metal isn't known for having the best lyrics, but even then, they're below average on this album. Take the lyrics to \"(Once) They Were Eagles\" for example, where this verse quotes:\n\nPure reflections memories in a haze\nTied to the ground, Forced to bow,\nYou may see dancing faces\n\nThis verse talks about someone being tied and forced to worship eagles. This verse doesn't make any sense, seeing as the person will eventually untie themselves and run away from the eagles. Not only are the lyrics poor, but their execution is sometimes poor. In \"Cherry Orchards\", the lyrics deal with themes of love, but the track's more powerful instruments and angry vocals make the lyrics feel out of place. The lyrics are the worst part on this album, and they sometimes stop the songs from reaching their full potential.\n\nOverall, this album is a lot better than a lot of people make it out to be. While the lyrics are the biggest problem, the vocal delivery is decent and the instruments hold up well. I can understand people having strong negative feelings towards the album, but if you let go of its troubled past and focus strictly on its musical merits, you may be surprised. As far as glam metal albums go, this is one lake you definitely should swim in.\n",
        "\nIn order to be outstanding amidst one's peers, they need not explicitly seek to be the most polarizing or unique of the bunch. Rather, having a distinct and clear vision, whether derivative of other bodies of work or not, and being able to execute it to its fully realized potential, is the deciding factor in what makes a work of art truly \"good\", in my opinion - uniqueness can often be a byproduct of this creative honesty. That's the best segue into a monolith of an early extreme metal classic like Celtic Frost's seminal debut EP/album I can think of, because, bar none, I take this to be the greatest piece of proto-black/death metal of the entire first wave movement, wielding a punishing atmosphere, an intriguing sense of esotericism, and sick fucking extreme metal riffs all as colors on a palette of unparalleled classiness. It's that classiness that makes this album feel entirely timeless and not even remotely dated to this day - and this is coming from someone who regards Hell Awaits, Seven Churches, and Pleasure to Kill as untouchable essentials of early extreme metal as well. Something about early Celtic Frost, though, feels darker and more solemn than the works of their boundary-pushing contemporaries, while retaining the overall crudeness, and it's not just because of abstract works of art like \"Danse Macabre\" and \"Tears in a Prophet's Dream.\" \n\nThe latter point is evident from the very beginning of \"Into the Crypts of Rays\" wherein the band's riff structures and progressions present themselves as ever so slightly more involved and metallic than they were on the Satanic Rites demo released under the band's previous moniker, Hellhammer. This makes for a song that may superficially appear to be, but most certainly is anything but, a standard 80's extreme metal rager. The repetition of the chunky, bludgeoning riffs (which has influenced Obituary-type death metal bands to a larger extent than most second wave black metal bands excluding Darkthrone) met with Tom Warrior's proto-death growls makes for the most intense music yet conceived in 1984, and compositionally and tonally, still some of the most intense you can listen to. \"Visions of Mortality\" and the now standard song which wasn't on the original EP \"Dethroned Emperor\" are the perfect balance of crude thrash, doomy oppression, and mid-paced brooding. I cannot stress enough how well these songs embody driving, mid-paced, menacing aggression, counterbalancing the chug-heavy fare which serves as the marrow of the substantial caveman riffs with power chord crunches that do not offer any melody but do offer intriguing progressions which lend memorability and sullen catchiness to the music. \n\nBasically, this is the template for crude, dark extreme metal riffs, neither fast nor slow, and it's the reason why bands like Obituary, Bolt Thrower, Morta Skuld, Asphyx, or Benediction are so successful at delivering mid-paced devastation. Speaking of such OSDM heroes, you can also hear the influence Celtic Frost's faster compositions on this album like the title track or \"Nocturnal Fear\", as well as parts of \"Return to the Eve\", had; the instruments charge forward relentlessly like a freight train, as songs like \"Back to One\" by Obituary, \"Dying Remains\" by Morta Skuld, and \"Embers\" by Bolt Thrower do in their intro sequences, and the vocals are like an additional spiked battering ram on the front of this freight train. Indeed, Celtic Frost can be pointed to for inspiring the tendency of later extreme bands to use their harsh vocals as an additional instrument (for example, with bands like Incantation, you get the sense that a lot of the atmosphere comes from those low, \"cavernous vocals\", just as much as the guitars), yet the above mentioned slower tracks still have a Sabbathy element of singing with the main riff. The latter point is important to note because it serves to strengthen the argument that with these dynamics, Celtic Frost deliver the blueprint for tastefully dark extreme metal - not going so far as to abandon traditional heavy metal, but still pushing the envelope considerably, both with their compositions and the atmosphere they evoke.\n\nLastly, I must admit my shortcomings in writing this review, and a shortcoming that I perceive most of my peers have when discussing bands like Celtic Frost. I, a tasteless, narrow-minded, and dumb metalhead view this album as an intense, loud, crude, badass extreme metal classic that I enjoy immensely on a sonic level. Yet it is so much more than metal, and I cannot stress this enough. Celtic Frost dealt in esotericism and abstract art and that is something anyone needs to understand before approaching their music as just another set of metal classics. I fail here because I do not have an appreciation for this esotericism that goes beyond acknowledging its presence and finding it fucking badass and unique. It's... hard to explain, but the point is I'm not well-versed enough on the influences (likely literature or occult mythology) these guys had outside of music to really grasp the transcendent art they offer on Morbid Tales, so I'll just keep banging my head to it.\n",
        "\nHow many texts have been written about Hellhammer / Celtic Frost? About the difficult youth of Tom G. Warrior, about his and Martin E. Ain\u2019s far-reaching musical visions? Together with Bathory, early Sodom and naturally Venom, Hellhammer is still one of the most influential role-models for millions of extreme metal hordes. Celtic Frost soon left the path that Hellhammer had walked, but \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d (and \u201cEmperor\u2019s Return\u201d) was not far away from the material on \u201cApocalyptic Raids\u201d. It\u2019s simple, non-orchestral and hardly progressive black metal in its most primordial form. It is part of the Swiss phenomenon that it changed its musical direction more or less consequently with every new release, but regardless of the musical quality of the different periods, it seems that their very early works were the most fascinating for the worldwide underground. I mention this, because the historical importance for the further evolution of extreme metal should not be ignored when writing a review. Even though I don\u2019t think that \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d can compete with the gargantuan \u201cTo Mega Therion\u201d, I must admit that its relevance is awe-inspiring.\n\nThe European version of \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d offered only six tracks, the US copies were supplemented by two songs (the title track and \u201cEmperor\u2019s Return\u201d \u2013 in Europe, these cuts had been part of a compilation of Noise Records). Honestly speaking, the title track is really missing. I wish I could swap it with the non-musical horror scenario \u201cDanse Macabre\u201d. However, the mini album features a handful of real songs and all of them have this idiosyncratic aura of defiance, resilience and negativity. \u201cInto the Crypts of Rays\u201d kicks off the vinyl and its class lies in the eyes of the beholder. Is it just a simple, rapid neckbreaker with a dull solo after a short breather? Or is it the prototype of first wave black metal with a great chorus, minimalistic but surprisingly catchy, and with a subliminal form of magic that lives in every beginning? Make your choice, but be aware of the fact that its speedy design does not really represent the album. Roughly 50% of the material is characterized by the stoic, mid-paced flow of pretty primitive guitar lines, for example the well-known \u201cProcreation of the Wicked\u201d and \u201cReturn to the Eve\u201d, while \u201cVisions of Mortality\u201d turns from a creeping monster into a high-speed bastard.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to understand the impact of Hellhammer\u2019s and Frost\u2019s early releases from today\u2019s perspective, because they seem to have no unique selling point. Everything runs in well-trodden paths, but it was exactly the Swiss legend that made these paths walkable. The fundament of the songs was a necrotic tissue that had never shown up before in terms of extreme metal and this, the concise \u201cUgh\u201d and the grinding, droning guitar gave and still give the music its very special character. And to integrate a narrative part in \u201cReturn to the Eve\u201d, performed by a woman with an absolutely emotionless pitch, showed that Tom and Martin (R.I.P.) had definitely already begun to think outside the box.\n\nFinally, the anti-establishment-attitude of the group was also reflected by the production. It did not know any nuances, it was just a stew of death-affine tones. Anyway, the sound did not miss its effect. Having said this, \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d provided a very individual listening experience, both in terms of the musical content and the technical frame. The mainly speed-oriented \u201cNocturnal Fear\u201d closed the cycle.\n\nAlthough I possess the first pressing, bought in 1984 or 1985, my copy has no poster and no lyric sheet. That\u2019s not okay, because the cover indicated that a poster is included. Maybe I will file a sue against Noise Records for this impertinence one day\u2026 But the back cover was also not consistently truthful in its statements. The \u201cthanx-list\u201d promised: don\u2019t panic, we\u2019ll never wimp out \u2013 with an underlined \u201cnever\u201d. Well\u2026 \u201cCold Lake\u201d? \u201cPrototype\u201d? But however, \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d does not deserve a review that ends with a bitter taste, because it was a grim, painfully resolute and widely excellent release of real outsiders from a comfortable region in Europe that crushed into an Anglo-Saxon and North American dominated scene. This was another interesting detail about this unit which seemed to be driven by its inner demons. Anyway, Hellhammer\u2019s / Celtic Frost\u2019s enormous reputation has many reasons, but one thing is for sure. We would not talk about them anymore if they had not been able to write great songs. You\u2019ll find five of them on this mini album.\n",
        "\nIn darkness. Thou shalt come unto me.\n\nSo here I am, finally decided to write my first review. It's not a coincidence that I have chosen Monotheist for this endeavor. Firstly, this is the first album that introduced me to what I later called truly dark and extreme music, so this has a special place in my heart. I still remember the first listen 10 years ago, and it changed me forever ever since. Secondly, the state of the world right now with a global pandemic, being locked inside together with the cold foggy November nights makes this a perfect re-listen.\n\nRegarding the music itself, a lot of words already filled this page. Tom G. Warrior is a true master, and his later work with Triptykon reinforces this statement. Yes, there are some misses here and there during his career, but those are insignificant. He is never afraid to experiment with his music, incorporating elements of doom, black and Gothic, together with the excellent mix of clean, cold and depressive vocals, making this a real dark experience. Although this is not the most complex album out there in terms of composition (doesn't have layers upon layers with tons of riffs) the beauty of it lies in its simplicity.\n\nFrom the first moments of \"Progeny\", you know what to expect. Pure hatred and despair. There are also a few \"softer\" tracks inserted in between the more \"aggressive\" ones (\"Drown in Ashes\" and \"Obscured\") with some lovely female voice. At first you will think that these are for the listener to take a bit of a fresh air with a slightly sense of hope, but don't let that fool you. Actually, it will grab your spirit to the deepest abyss one can imagine, leaving your mortal body behind a pool of it's own blood, and no (dying) god is there to save you. All of this ends with the monolithic and magnificent 14 minutes \"Synagoga Satanae\" and before you realize it, \"Winter\" is already in your room.\n\nSpeaking of dying gods, a special mention for the highlight of the album: \"A Dying God Coming into Human Flesh\", where all the elements described before really come together. From the thick bass to heavy doom-ish pace, with the haunting vocal duties of Martin E. Ain, makes this a rather strange and claustrophobic experience. But elevating and enjoyable nevertheless. All what remains in the end it is for you to witness in misery \"As the snow falls. To cover this all.\".\n",
        "\nI know it seems like beating a dead horse but since I have only recently come across Celtic Frost's infamous Prototype demo, I simply have to say that this might be the worst release I have ever listened to. That means something after having explored thousands of albums of multiple genres throughout the years. Everything that could be wrong with a release is wrong here and my emotions progressively varied from surprise to shock to disgust while making it through that abomination.\n\nThe thin production might perhaps be excusable for a demo but the rest certainly isn't. The overuse of artificial keyboard sounds, atrocious drum computer patterns and nerve-firing vocal effects is dreadful. The song writing is terrible varying from vapid electronic instrumental tunes over repetitive gothic rock soundscapes to hip hop sounds that don't even work if one considered them a humorous parody. The single songs include lackluster instrumental performances, terrible vocals by the lead singer and an unknown number of misused guests and plod on endlessly instead of ever getting to the point. The band tries to be diverse and show that it has no boundaries which makes the fact that it fails at every single genre it explores even worse. Prototype is an example for how to not make music that isn't even voluntarily nihilistic like some underground black metal demo tape. It's so bad that it's not even so bad it's good anymore. It's music to torture people to if you are a particularly evil monster.\n\nThe negative reactions regarding that disaster are entirely justified and even someone who claims to have an open mind couldn't possibly seriously appreciate that abomination. I've made the mistake to even listen to that release because its negative reputation made me curious about it. I won't ever get those forty-seven wasted minutes back and am only attempting to write this short review to prevent you from going through the same ordeal to give at least some meaning to my aural suffering. Celtic Frost and its infinite side projects have often had their weird moments but that release really hits rock bottom. Avoid it at all costs.\n",
        "\nThe debut full-length album of legendary Celtic Frost, for which this work wasn't a debut in general. The band was called legendary for a reason, because its influence on extreme metal is just huge. And the band already released some important records before \"To Mega Therion\", including the ones under the name of Hellhammer. Yet \"To Mega Therion\" became even more important than the previous albums of the bands fronted by Tom G. Warrior. Hellhammer appeared as a raw, ugly and rough band, which was a sort of wilder, heavier and more aggressive version of Venom, with some doomy vibes. Gradually it was evolving into something completely different. \"Apocalyptic Raids\" was already very close to the initial form of Celtic Frost, which later was demonstrated on mini-albums \"Morbid Tales\" and \"Emperor's Return\". Then there came \"To Mega Therion\", which became another significant mark of progress for Celtic Frost.\n\nStylistically the music of \"To Mega Therion\" isn't much different from thrash metal of those times, despite the fact of a more frequent using of low tempo. However, the sound of \"To Mega Therion\" is rawer and harsher, than it has usually been in thrash metal, while it creates a darker atmosphere, which is more comparable with Venom, Bathory and early Sodom than with popular thrash metal bands of the mid 80s. That's the reason why Celtic Frost became especially influential on black metal, with which it is associated even today, even though stylistically, for example, \"The Return\" of Bathory is closer to the ultimate definition of black metal, while this album was released a bit earlier than \"To Mega Therion\", but Celtic Frost is still placed in the first wave black metal category for a reason. Also, it's very interesting, that already the debut full-length record of Celtic Frost had some quite progressive features for its genre and time, as it masterfully utilizes a French horn, although only occasionally.\n\nThe music of \"To Mega Therion\" is just striking. The album is absolutely holistic, while every composition of it remains memorable and extremely catchy. Tom G. Warrior provides a one killer riff after another. The album opens with an unusual composition for it, as \"Innocence and Wrath\" is a short instrumental, which sounds totally majestic. The riffs are slow and triumphant there, the French horn is on the first plane and it brings an atmosphere of something frightening and grandiose coming. After this composition there goes \"The Usurper\", with tons of energy and darkness. Since this moment the music of the release is pretty much in the same manner. The other significantly distinct part of \"To Mega Therion\" since the intro is a dark ambient interlude, \"Tears in a Prophet's Dream\". Yet how memorable are all compositions. It tells only about how remarkable the songwriting is. And Tom G. Warrior is that good not only with guitars, but also with vocals. His voice is harsh, it sounds like a kinda proto-version of growling, while Tom performs in a very charismatic manner. All those \"Hey!\" and \"Ugh!\" of him only boost the energy of the album higher. \n\nChanges of tempo is a brilliant move. The tempo alternates in different directions. The likes of \"Jewel Throne\" and \"Eternal Summer\" start slow and eventually they demonstrate spectacular speed-ups. \"Jewel Throne\" is especially spectacular, when after the prolonged low-paced start the tempo wildly rises with the trademark \"Ugh!\" of Tom, after what the guitars provide some hellish mess. And on \"Eternal Summer\" the variations of tempo are more frequent. On the other hand, \"Circle of the Tyrants\", for instance, starts fast, but it has very catchy low-paced choruses, which sound even march-like to some extent. The level of darkness increases in these choruses. This composition is a one of the very best on \"To Mega Therion\". And among the other very best compositions \"Dawn of Megiddo\" and \"Necromantical Screams\" should be mentioned. Furthermore, these two tracks are the most standout on the release after the intro and the interlude. Also, those are the only compositions featuring a French horn, including \"Innocence and Wrath\".\n\n\"Dawn of Megiddo\" starts with slow riffing, which sounds dark and even carries some suspense. The tempo doesn't go higher than mid on this composition. Slowly, but certainly the eerie riffing crawls to the choruses, where the guitars slow down even more, where the triumphant and the ominous French horn appears. It's a one of the standout episodes of \"To Mega Therion\", it sounds as grandiose and frightening as the opening track. \"Necromantical Screams\" is also variating only with low and mid-tempo. It is a one of the darkest compositions of the album as well. Once again, the French horn and the focus on low tempo are key factors for that. There are some occasional female vocals on \"To Mega Therion\" and exactly on \"Necromantical Screams\" the parts with them are especially important. Female vocals make the mysterious atmosphere of the composition more pronounced.\n\n\"To Mega Therion\" is an absolutely remarkable work, a flawless one. Its title translates like \"the great beast\" and it's quite descriptive in terms of the album's place in the hierarchy of extreme metal. It sounds harsh, dark, majestic and very memorable. It's a one of the best releases of Celtic Frost and the most impressive Celtic Frost's record in the 20th century. It's for a reason listed among the most important works of the first wave black metal and extreme metal in whole. \"To Mega Therion\" is simply monumental.\n",
        "\nIt's been 32 years since this album has been released and to be totally honest with you guys I have never gotten through to every single song in its entirety because I just can't. I have heard bits of each of the songs and for some reason I just turn it off - it bothers me. The only song I've ever been able to get through is 'Cherry Orchards' because I saw the video when I was about 17 and it was very difficult to see Tom G. Warrior and the rest of the band looking like Motley Crue and Poison. And with the big hair and that totally glammed-out look it wasn't a very good sight to see. If you are a hardcore fan of the 'Morbid Tales' and 'To Mega Therion' lps like me, this is like a monkey wrench thrown into the works. Those albums were monumental in my book as some of the greatest death metal albums ever in the history of metal, but to see Tom Warrior glammed-out and writing songs like 'Dance Sleazy', I just can't even bring myself to listen to it for even a couple of minutes. \n\nLet's talk about the music here. Some reviews I've read have said that the production on this lp is weak, but I think it's not too bad, actually. The guitars sound decent as do the bass and drums, but the riffs that Tom Warrior and Curt Victor Bryant have come up sound like they're doing a version of Motley Crue and W.A.S.P.. Tom Warrior's vocals sound nothing like they did on the previous albums. I can't really find a way to describe them. It's weird. As I said, I tried to get through the rest of the songs on this album and I last about a minute because it just bugs me. The riffs are stale and they sound so bland. Just trying to be in that mold of glam rock and hair metal that other bands were doing in the '80s and it comes up short in a lot of ways. And it's hard to understand that a once great writer like Tom Warrior can write such silly lyrics as in 'Downtown Hanoi' - it's really bad. The song 'Petty Obsession' is just as bad lyrically as well, and it's hard to even read the lyrics without saying 'what the fuck???'.\n\nI don't think Tom Warrior himself can listen to this lp, that's how disgusted he is with it and I don't blame him one bit. If this would have been released under a different name, I would have understood....maybe. But I can somewhat understand why he did this album - the music industry was dicking him over and that's the core of the reason why he put this lp out. You guys gotta remember in the '80s, underground death metal music was accepted by a very limited audience, and since those bands like Frost weren't selling millions of records, they were constantly being screwed over by the record company and the industry. And I don't think Tom Warrior gave a shit about anything and he just wanted to party and release something that was so out of left field that he didn't care. Hey, we all make mistakes, but I respect Tom for taking the blame for this album and at least he owns up to it and doesn't hide away from it. I think he liked it at that time and thought it was an important album for Frost...but that feeling didn't last long. Even after a few years he hated it and wished he could have changed it. \n\nI think when I hear the bits of these songs, it just totally sounds like a different band with no connection between the style that they established from 1983 till 1986 at all. And yet to see this band who, in my eyes, were so immensely powerful and had that gift to create such masterpieces fail so badly, it hurts me so much. Just to fall to this level is still today a huge mystery. Disappointing isn't even the word to describe it. The music here is, like I said, stale, and the riffs don't move you - they're trying too hard to be like Motley Crue and it's not good at all.\n\nWell, at least you'll never have to hear any of this album's songs played live ever again, thank goodness. I think it's funny that when they reissued all the Celtic Frost albums, they purposely omitted reissuing this one...gee, I wonder why? I honestly don't think even if you paid Tom Warrior a lot of money, he would even try to play any song off this lp. I think he would rather die than have to play any of these songs ever again and who can blame him?\n\nAnd there are some people who like this album who liked the previous records and I don't understand that at all. I've met some people over the years that feel that way. Maybe some of them can tell me I'm too close- minded. I'm just being sensible. There's no way in hell if you were a fan of the previous albums like 'Morbid Tales' that you can accept this really drastic change of an album - that's the bottom line. And this album was a really drastic switch, no doubt. But some people do like it and I'll never get it. But if Tom Warrior can't even stomach this album 30 years later, what does that tell you? I'm willing to bet you if he had a time machine, he would have made the decision to change the album totally. Or maybe just erase it from their history. That would have been a good idea.\n",
        "\nI was introduced to this EP via the combined \"Morbid Tales\" and \"Emperor's Return\" EPs (commonly just known as \"Morbid Tales\", likely the release that many fans have been exposed to these songs by).\n\nTo get the two outliers out of the way: \"Dethroned Emperor\" and \"Morbid Tales\" are from the original sessions for the \"Morbid Tales\" EP, however were not included on the original European release of that EP (but were on the U.S. release). These two tracks are just as good as anything on \"Morbid Tales\". \"Dethroned Emperor\" is a great sludgy/doomy track, my first introduction to extreme metal in fact so it will always hold a special place to me, while \"Morbid Tales\" is more of a midpaced/faster song, complete with the excellent refrain \"are you morbid?\" (why yes I am Tom, thank you for asking). I've always really enjoyed the production on that first EP in fact, in my opinion it's the best they ever had, the exception being \"Monotheist\" since it is too modern to really compare fairly.\n\nBut damn, it is a shame that the three tracks unique to the \"Emperor's Return\" sessions were produced in such a subpar manner. Especially given that it was recorded after \"Morbid Tales\", it is a severe decline in quality. The biggest offender by far is Tom's vocals: they are very quiet and lack all of their usual charm. It sounds like he is vocalizing in a different room with a thick wall between him and the recording equipment: I'd say on \"Circle of the Tyrants\" especially, if you're familiar with that track on \"To Mega Therion\", this version will just disappoint you hearing how insignificant the vocal presence is. For the other two tracks on this EP that came from these sessions and were never rerecorded, well, they are both relative speedsters, but the same production issues persist. The guitar is also a bit muddier than would be preferred, making it harder to make out the riffs compared to the prior EP. Only the drums sound decently produced, keeping the snare, bass drums, and cymbals all fairly emphasized. The songwriting is still consistent with the first EP, but damn the result just doesn't sound anywhere near as good.\n\nIn all likelihood when seeking out early Frost music, you will obtain the first two EPs combined together. The three tracks from the \"Emperor's Return\" actual recording sessions are placed at the end, almost making them like afterthoughts anyway. \"Circle of the Tyrants\" was fortunately rerecorded on their debut full length and it's one of the best songs there. As for the other two, we are only left wondering what might have been, if they could have had the same production as the \"Morbid Tales\" EP.\n\nThere is one more song from these sessions though: \"Journey into Fear\", which wasn't released until their early 90s compilation \"Parched with Thirst Am I and Dying\". The production, to these ears anyway, sounds a little better, and the vocals definitely seem louder, still not as good as \"Morbid Tales\" but at least getting there. I might actually enjoy this song the most, since at least Tom doesn't sound like he's grunting from so far away. This one is worth checking out.\n\nUltimately, do get \"Morbid Tales\" in its expanded form, do enjoy the two \"Emperor's Return\" tracks that were from those original sessions anyway... and best of luck trying to enjoy the other three tracks. I've been trying for over a decade and it's just not there.\n",
        "\nAfter the deep dive in this toxic cold lake, Tom G. Warrior threw his trunks away and so he stood there naked. Not a pretty sight. Due to a lack of alternatives, he was heading for new shores. This exercise was not easy \u2013 just listen to the opener of \u201cVanity / Nemesis\u201d. Regardless whether you select the song title \u201cMy Heart Beneath\u201d, the riffing or the precious singing of the master himself, one thing becomes very obvious. This song could have been part of \u201cCold Lake\u201d as well. And the band pic on the back cover also rather indicated another desecration of Celtic Frost\u2019s once untouchable reputation than a return to the masterpieces of a time long ago. Nevertheless, the album has a darker aura than its predecessor. The Swiss dudes intended to regain a certain wickedness and the dry and unpretentious sound was just one component in this respect. However, there was a very important thing missing: the majestic grandeur, the self-evident blackness of their former compositions. Once innovators, now one in a million. Aggravating this situation, I cannot say that they walked the trodden paths of mid-harsh metal in an outstanding manner. The riffing lacks impulsiveness and so parts of the album sound like the work of old men. More or less the complete A side has nothing that sets an impulse. Lacklustre compositions are caught in their mid-paced patterns and any form of sustainable chorus does not occur. As if all this were not enough, the band catapults itself into complete meaninglessness with the boring, lame and uninspired cover version at the end of the first half.\n\nThe A side illustrates the dilemma of the whole album. It lacks character. Yes, even \u201cCold Lake\u201d had one, although it was an unpleasant one. But the A side of \u201cVanity / Nemesis\u201d emanates absolutely nothing. What keeps sticking in the ear after these five tunes? The female voice in \u201cWings of Solitude\u201d? Okay, if this is the most outstanding feature than we know that former idols have lost their instinct, their innovative force and their special sense for monumental deeds. The B side starts where the first four songs of the A side have ended: in total mediocrity. They are too good to hate them and much too bad to feel the urge to listen to them more times than necessary. Yes, it is almost a complete debacle, because one can be of the opinion that there is nothing worse than a piece of art that leaves the beholder / listener completely cold. Thank God, after almost everything is already said and done, the album rises like Phoenix from the ashes. It\u2019s a little Phoenix, but it is better than nothing.\n\nCeltic Frost are able to change the course with \u201cA Kiss or a Whisper\u201d. It flirts a little bit with \u201cThe Usurper\u201d, although it cannot reach the quality level of this classic, by far not. Nevertheless, it reveals at least a minimum of currishness. And it is a signal that the band does not intend to leave the arena without having shown a real fight. The two-piece title track underlines this. \u201cVanity\u201d is once again not too far away from the songs of the hairspray album, but its rasping guitars and the catchy chorus form a strong piece. Finally, \u201cNemesis\u201d pays tribute to the first mini album, because its intro seems to be an excerpt of \u201cHuman\u201d. However, that\u2019s not the crucial thing one must know about this song. Of greater relevance is the competent design with the soft beginning, the following heavyweight guitars and the coherent melody line that anticipates the chorus. Yes, the last three songs are responsible that the album does not drown in the sea of mediocrity, but all in all, this output was another damage to the once glorious name of the band. This was all the more disappointing in view of the pretty promising line-up with Martin Eric Ain (R.I.P.) and Stephen Priestly. But maybe they should have kicked Curt Victor Bryant in the ass before they began to record this album? I don\u2019t know. I just can say that the whole evolution of Celtic Frost after \u201cTo Mega Therion\u201d was a great misunderstanding, no more, no less. And that\u2019s a mild description.\n",
        "\n\"Woah! Fuck me Gothic... You actually listened to Cold Lake? I thought it was only gothic metal albums you reviewed.\"\n\nThat was one thing that came to mind when I was diving into this review of legendary extreme metal band Celtic Frost and their supposedly god awful album. Don't get me wrong Celtic Frost have always been a great band for being influential in extreme metal. I even see Celtic Frost as a precursor band for gothic metal for adding gothic elements to extreme metal. Loved \"Morbid Tales,\" loved \"To Mega Therion,\" and loved \"Monotheist.\" And then there's \"Cold Lake.\" An album that is so infamously despised by even Tom Warrior that he has made it hard for you guys to find a copy of this album and I totally understand. \n\nNow \"Cold Lake\" was actually an album that was recommended to me by my online buddies and I just never wanted to listen to this album. Not only have I heard this album was bad, but it's basically a betrayal among the die hard fans for abandoning their sound for a glam metal sound. So, I decided to listen to this album now for two reasons. One: just to hear how bad it sounds and two: wanted to listen to more bad albums just to know which albums I would consider to be the absolute worst. \"Cold Lake\" after listening to this album, I realized it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it's still bad.\n\nThere is only one thing that is going for in \"Cold Lake\" and that is the guitars. It is still kinda dark than the average glam metal album. It has some slither of Celtic Frost sound to hear in the album in a few Songs, but it was obviously overpowered by the fuzzy glam sounds. I do hear some good chords in \"Cold Lake\" like in \"Blood in Kisses\" which does have similarities to the previous Celtic Frost albums. Another small thing I like about the album is the fact that it's short. Normally, I ripped on an album just for being too short, but in the case of \"Cold Lake\" it's a very generous 38 minutes that won't make this album feel like a chore. Some of the music is alright like in \"Downtown Hanoi\" because again has similarities to the previous albums. To be fair the music has some comprehension, but it's entirely rare.\n\nThe first obvious problem with \"Cold Lake\" by how much glam metal is in this album. I have some tolerance to glam metal music, but when it comes to Celtic Frost this felt like a sucker punch to the gut. The band's abandonment to this kind of music is betrayal to a lot of metal fans who rebel against the 80s glam metal movement. This would certainly feel like an album for my mom as I normally associate glam metal as \"mom music.\" The licks on the guitar are really annoying and are all over this album with obnoxious fuzzy guitars. The drumming is decent, but it sounds so clicky and doesn't present any skill.\n\nThe second problem I have with this album is the lyrics. Now most of the lyrics are incredibly hard to find unless you find the CD, which is near hard to find. I did find lyrics to \"Seduce Me Tonight\" and well... its terrible. The only decency is in \"Cherry Orchard,\" but with that it's not saying much. Just by hearing the other Songs the way the lyrics is structured is more like verse-chorus-verse-chorus and its pretty boring. I kept hearing the title of the Song on most Songs too which is not too creative either, and is basically there to not have the Songs sound like it has less singing.\n\nLastly, and this is the biggest problem with \"Cold Lake\" and that's Tom Warrior's obnoxious vocal approach. It is not only whiny, but it's pretty bland. No power, not even singing to justify this as a glam metal album, Tom's vocals on this album was one of the worst performances I heard. It feels like listening to a jock sing about love and sex only to lead up to singing in front of people and the audience was cringing. That is the one word I can describe this performance: Cringy. This part of the review made me feel bad for Tom Warrior for having to go through this sudden change. \n\n\"Cold Lake\" is pretty terrible. Celtic Frost had already turned heads with their previous album \"Into the Pandemonium\" and it was clear that further experimentation to the next album turned to chopping heads. Even if you wanted to look for some hair metal music I would still steer clear of this album. One thing I forgot to mention with \"Cold Lake\" that is good about it is that it's an example of what not to do with experimentation. What not to do with joining the bandwagon. If had Celtic Frost released this album three years later, then they would have been fucked as the rest of the glam bands would be extinct by grunge. Even though, this album had an occasional redeeming quality to it, I just don't get it. Plain and simple. Don't worry Tom I feel your pain.\n",
        "\nBasically anyone that has a minimum of knowledge in the extreme metal history knows about Celtic Frost. This band couldn't require any introduction whatsoever. Anyway, these guys have gone through a rough time to achieve some success in the underground. Starting out as Hellhammer, their music was rather low-fi with its primitive sound, it was also angry and full of hatred. They also had that grim and depressive atmosphere, especially in the \"Apocalyptic Raids\" EP, which I didn't like quite as much as the aggressive vibe of the \"Satanic Rites\" demo. Tom G Warrior and Martin Eric Ain (R.I.P.) disbanded Hellhammer after thinking they couldn't do anything else in that band anymore, thus the reason that Celtc Frost was formed and considered as their \"true\" band. I would not argue that it was a fine decision because the stuff released by the aforementioned band is even better and also better produced (for the time of course). After the legendary 1984 first release \"Morbid Tales\", the band has not even reached its peak yet, as they were about to unleash the classic reviewed here.\n\nThe famous official first full-length \"To Mega Therion\" of Celtic Frost was released back in late 1985. At first, what got me interested so much about this album is how beautiful the cover art is. This is exactly the kind of front cover that gets me excited to give that record a listen. With 40 minutes of material that totalize ten tracks, we have plenty of variety to discover from on how the band evolved its sound. As soon as you play this record, you get the dark and sinister ambient track called \"Innocence and Wrath\" that act as an introduction. It's setting you in the right mood to what is coming next, the admirable classic \"The Usurper\". You will obviously notice the memorable vocal tone of Tom G Warrior with his \"UGHH!\" and those pounding riffs that makes the music unique and different from what was going on at the time. The song structures of Celtic Frost has nearly always been fuck top, which is awesome. One good sample is \"Jewel Throne\", which has that heavy mid-paced main riff, but later turns into the fastest part of the whole album. The songs are very well-written in the sense that you don't get tired of listening to them mainly because of the beats and paces that change quite often.\n\nEven though the guys from Celtic Frost has improved musically since their beginning in Hellhammer, the music is still not really technical. However, it doesn't make the music less good, in fact, the atmosphere displayed on that album is the real deal, not some fancy guitar solos. \"To Mega Therion\" to me is kind of separated in two sections, one being the heavier and thrashier tracks, and the other one more focused on the dark and spooky vibe touches added in the music with a French horn\u00ad. The most popular track of the band, \"Circle of the Tyrants\" with \"Fainted Eyes\" are basically killer tracks that goes straightforward in term of brutality and intensity, as well as having catchy choruses. You can also see a pretty sick doomy middle part in \"Eternal Summer\", even if the main sections are fast-paced. Well, when we speak of grim ambience, the instrumental \"Tears in a Prophet's Dream\" is one hell of a good example. This has most likely been a great influence to the music seen in some 90s black metal bands. It's honestly not the kind of track I would personally listen to often, but we cannot deny how original it is.\n\nMusically and artistically speaking, the most interesting track to me was \"Necromantical Screams\". It's heavy, atmospheric, but has that doom metal vibe that fits perfectly with the vocals of Tom G Warrior. I would add that \"Dawn of Megiddo\" has also that kind of mood within its structure, but I still prefer the latter one mainly because of its better riffs. Production-wise, this album is near top-notch, at least for me. The guitar tone is definitely the highlight here though, despite the drums being awesome with its perfect presence on the mix. The only thing that would have benefit the album sound even more is a little more bass, other than that, I have nothing bad to say, really. This is the kind of classic records that I don't even need to recommend them at this point. If you have never listened to this album before, what are you waiting for?\n\nFavorite tracks:\n\nCircle of the Tyrants\nEternal Summer\nJewel Throne\nNecromantical Screams\n",
        "\nThis album is pretty bad, but it's got some good traits that go along with it. Though, the annoying, \"jock-singing\" is just flat-out retarded. And so with the introduction of this record. Seriously, if you guys had doubts about releasing this, you shouldn't have done so...it's just totally lame, and to take this album seriously...is another joke... The band have become so stale this time around, it's almost mind-boggling. \n\nThe female vocals are a nice twist. But a little corny. Thomas' vocals are so stupid. He sounds like a kid from high school, who's a total reject. And the voice he uses is a fucking joke. Reminds me of a clown on a football team in America, too. And that dumb intro track with the fucking weird \"bass\" thumps was so, so stupid... I mean, really. It sounded so \"modern\" at that time. This band sure did struggle after their 1985 release, I'm not kidding. Even the lyrics are fucking bad, too. They sound so...\"dramatic\" and \"attention-seeking-like\". \n\nThe guitars are, however, better than everything else on this release. They provide some interesting, smooth riffing of all the strings. Really fancy guitar work and melodic and heavy shredding solos. It's backed-up by the decent bass production in the background, for the actual touch of \"vast greatness\". The riffs are a little technical, but generally groovy and simplistic. The drums are a little boring. I feel like the drummer is performing more \"rock 'n' roll\" than\"metal\" at this point. It's a little dumb. The drumming sounds generally lazier than it should. Not good for a band that has gained such high respects. \n\nYou would think that, based on the artwork, that this album would've been good. But no, it's actually pretty bad. The artwork seemed so good, too. A shame it was thrown away because of the horrible ideas that went into the main construction of piece (of shit). I began to hate the record more as it progressed more...and...more...and then I felt it was just a mistake, in general. I'm totally annoyed by the dumb remarks this album creates. It's basically a bad joke. This could have been Celtic's best record, but instead it's the least-best effort...they have given up on themselves this time. \n\nThe atmosphere and literal feeling of this album, seem overly childish. It's like living another life in your mind, as a \"child\" in school and you want to relive your life as an actual child. It feels messed up and I'm not happy at-all about this record turned out. It's almost \"uncomfortable\" to listen to...even once is difficult, believe me. Everything is so underwhelming, with bad musical ideology. Though, it's worth noting that the artwork's background looks like the \"Shadow Realm\" from \"Yu-Gi-Oh! - Duel Monsters\". Probably created by Yami Marik or Yami Bakura. Regardless...the artwork is the second-best part of the record, behind the guitars and their melodies. This album is pretty much on par with everything that \"Car Door Dick Smash\" have released...period.\n",
        "\nThat this is the only official Celtic Frost live album is pretty sad for many reasons. The worst part about this album is how weak it sounds. Tom's vocals are thin and he sounds short of breath just four songs in. Even the backing vocals are soft, though I'm not sure if that's due to bad mixing or a poor performance. Vocals aren't the only weak sounding part of this album. Guitars are muffled, especially Tom's, who is at times borderline silent beneath Oliver Amberg's lead, Bryan's bass, and the drums from Priestly. It can be heard whenever he takes over solos, but aside from that, it sounds like there is only one guitar at times.\n\nThe weak sound is just one of many issues with this album. As I mentioned earlier, Tom's vocals are weak in this performance, and backing vocals aren't much better. Lyrics are cut short or completely off from the studio version in terms of rhythm or tone. However, the weakest performer on this album has got to be Oliver Amberg. He can play the riffs and he doesn't just stand still on stage, but his lead parts are awful. His solos aren't much more than random notes being played as fast as possible, at times missing the mark or playing something that doesn't fit the song at all. This is most prevalent and noticeable in songs that are not off of Cold Lake. I'd guess that's because he helped to write those songs rather than the ones off To Mega Therion and Into the Pandemonium. However, his improvised solo at the end of Petty Obsession shows that he's probably just not that good at guitar, at least not in the wake of a monster like Tom. \n\nThe setlist has good songs, obviously, but its structuring is questionable at best. The Usurper kicks off the album (poorly, as it sounds like the band falls out of time at points, and the vocals lack power) and then goes straight into Seduce Me Tonight. A lot of the songs on here are from Cold Lake, which isn't bad on its own. They're decent songs, they just don't fit the Celtic Frost sound. That's the biggest flaw of the setlist. It is jarring to go from something like The Usurper to Seduce Me Tonight, or from Little Velvet to Jewel Throne. While it could be possible to lead into the Cold Lake songs with tracks like Mexican Radio, this does not happen. It's like going from a hundred miles an hour to twenty-five in a second.\n\nThis performance is a miss on every front. The band members look absolutely ridiculous (especially Tom and Oliver), the setlist is poorly structured, the production is tape-recorder level quality, the vocals are off, the lead guitar is even worse, and the concert lacks the energy and power you'd expect from a band like Celtic Frost. If this is your first exposure to the band, it's probably a turn-off. That this is the one live video that was officially released by them is a tragedy. Any potential for decent moments are crushed by something rearing its ugly head (the guitar solo in Jewel Throne, the vocals and guitar solo on The Usurper). Cold Lake's songs are the best performed on this album, probably due to the fact that the guys performing on this live album/video recorded them. Songs from anything else are butchered. \n\nI suppose this is an important piece of history, but it's an ugly one. Don't expect much coming in, because that's all you're going to get with this performance.\n",
        "\nYou know, I went into this album thinking that this was probably one of those albums that people hate because it's a legendary band playing in a style they're \"not supposed\" to be playing in, or breaking away from the formula their fans are used to. I tend to actually like some of these albums: Endorama, Requiem, Strange and Beautiful, 90125, even Diabolus in musica (hell, it's Slayer's only worthwhile post-Seasons in the Abyss album as far as I'm concerned), and I even like some glam metal myself. So I figured that with this general track record I might actually enjoy this one. Was I correct about that?\n\nNo.\nNo, I was wrong.\nThis album is a fucking disaster. \n\nBasically, it's a horrific collision of glam, heavy, and thrash metal, all tied together with Tom Warrior's gloriously sexualized nasal whining in place of any actual singing. To be fair on that last point, we all know Tom isn't really much of a proper \"singer\" outside of a few songs, but damn, he could have tried something else here. Instead he just groans on at a weirdly high pitch about women and partying and the glam lifestyle of which he obviously knows nothing about and didn't want anything to do with in the first place. It's not surprising that he quickly disowned this album and abhors its very existence.\n\nBut while Tom's girly whining is bad, it's at least consistent in what it does. The actual music, though...oh man. The music is complete chaos. There's no proper form to anything being played here. Like I said earlier, the album is a blend of glam, heavy, and thrash metal. Oh, did I say blend? No, they didn't blend them together. They crashed the styles into one another forcibly resulting in one of the most grotesque bastardizations of these genres ever recorded. The songs try so hard to be melodic and catchy while still having a heavy edge to them, with hard rockin' guitar licks and massive, crashing drums, no one seems to know what they're trying to do around here and it's downright embarrasing. People give Prototype, their fucking NU METAL demo, shit for being a disaster, but at least Prototype had focus, some interesting sonic ideas going on, and retained the dark, ominous Celtic Frost atmosphere despite the change in style. This is haphazard and cocophanous.\n\nBut you know what the worst part about it all is? You can't stop listening to it. It's bad. It's real bad. But...it's just so damn...bizarre. You keep listening thinking \"this can't be real, there can't actually be music out there that sounds like this\". So you keep listening, trying to wrap your head around exactly what it is that you're hearing. You try to make sense of the compositions, you try to understand the frame of mind the musicians were in while making this, you try to simply imagine how the creative process must have worked to create the trainwreck of an album that you're listening to. Did they cut-up the pieces and paste different, unrelated sections together and just record what came out? Did they purposefully clash everything together so that their label would regret pushing them into this direction? Was this really, unbelievably, an accident?\n\nOutr\u00e9. That's a good word to describe this. Outr\u00e9.\n\nNow I've been bashing it, but it's definitely not the worst album ever, in metal or otherwise. The closing track, \"Roses Without Thorns\", is a surprisingly decent thrash metal track, and \"Cherry Orchards\", \"Juices Like Wine\" (JOOCES LIKE WHIIIINE), and \"Dance Sleazy\" are catchy enough songs as well. Tracks like \"Petty Obsession \" and \"Blood on Kisses\" are near unbearable, though.\n\nBut seriously...this is such a damn bizarre release in that 1) the fucking thing even actually exists, and 2) the fact that it even turned out sounding the way it does. And you know what? Yeah, it's bad, but to be honest, there certainly isn't anything else out there that sounds like this. In all complete honesty Cold Lake might actually the most accidentally avant-garde album ever recorded. This is probably one of the most avant-garde metal albums ever made not because it tried to be explicitly experimental, but because it just sounds so unbelievably outrageous.\n\nI'm just glad they didn't try to make a ballad on it. Could you imagine the horror that would have been unleashed from that?\n",
        "\nLooking at this CD, one of the most neglected, most disregarded albums in metal history\u2026 a very well-deserved status, everyone would agree. It would have been a serious insult on the metal fan\u2019s intelligence to accept the band back into the fray after the \u201cCold Lake\u201d. What could they have possibly created after it to placate their fanbase? \u201cTo Mega Therion 2\u201d? Another intimidating collection of \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d? Would have those done the trick?\n\nI don\u2019t think so; not after the first genuine flop in the annals of the genre, splashed right in the middle of the greatest year for metal. On the other hand, if you think of it, it wouldn\u2019t have hurt so bad, save for the band\u2019s most diehard followers of course, with so many great things happening in every single department\u2026 still, some paid attention, though, not feeling very happy with it as it was the first sign that their favourite music wouldn\u2019t be spared the industry\u2019s flippant, capricious meanderings, with arguably worse things to befall the hapless audience in the future... \n\nnot from the Celtic Frost camp, mind you, and not only because there couldn\u2019t have been a more embarrassing statement than \u201cthe most aggressive performers within the glam metal roster\u201d one made with\u2026 an apology for the momentary mindloss seemed like a more logical next step regardless of how many would be those to really vote to hear it. Tom G. Warrior and Co. owed it to their fans, and they had to soldier on, at least for one more stint. For the purpose the Co. part readily welcomed Martin E. Ain (R.I.P.), who was inexplicably (or maybe not really) missing from the \u201cCold Lake\u201d line-up, back. And the band do deliver with him in action as this farewell (at the time) opus sounds way more convincing than \u201cInto the Pandemonium\u201d, for one thing, as the guys do not want to mess around with so much experimentation, reducing the mentioned album\u2019s frivolous excesses to the minimum. \n\nThe band\u2019s effective, but ultimately hard to categorize, style is in full bloom once again here, and although thrash takes the leadership for a change this is nothing like the average, customary thrash metal odyssey out there the guys always keeping the staple element of surprise and the sense of unpredictability in the air, for better or worse. \u201cThe Heart Beneath\u201d and the more lyrical (watch out for some nice female vocals here) \u201cWings Of Solitude\u201d nicely update the guys\u2019 effective heavy delivery of old for the newer, anticipating the groove, generation but it\u2019s the speedy roller-coaster \u201cWine in My Hand (Third from the Sun)\u201d, already heard on a single a few months earlier, the belligerent stompiness of \u201cThe Name Of My Bride\u201d, and the insistent galloping urgency of \u201cPhallic Tantrum\u201d that propel the album forward, and compensate for the slightly shaky nature of the longer, more ambitious material which comprises the somewhat monotonous proto-doomster \u201cNemesis\u201d and the balladic psychedelic \u201cThis Island Earth\u201d, a Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music) cover with Warrior attempting some semi-successful cleaner vocals to a rousing effect. Not so much outside-the-box ideas elsewhere, fortunately, with \u201cThe Restless Seas\u201d thrashing confidently in a bumpy mid-paced manner, and \u201cA Kiss or A Whisper\u201d notching the intensity to the max, a brief dynamic headbanger with rowdy lashing riffs. \n\nApology well noted, and although the band saw themselves overtaken by their apprentices Coroner in the mean time, also not very well fitting into the more demanding technical/progressive metal landscape at the dawn of the new decade, they should have felt at least partially content with the final result as this was an admirable way to try and bury their vain glammy dreams with something way more appropriate. The totally relevant, self-reflective album-title should by all means add a few more points to their resume as the band were obviously well aware of the mistake they had made, with no intentions whatsoever on treading the same path. It wasn\u2019t exactly a farewell song, either, as the band hung around for another few years, their subsequent endeavours amounting to half an hour of more nemeses, this time titled \u201cNemesis of Power\u201d, the 1993 demo. Not the most dignified sequel to a savoured apology, it saw the band just grooving around in a nonchalant Helmet-esque fashion, the staple experimental touches sounding awkward on the pretty listless background.\n\nThe album reviewed here was naturally the first attempt at getting back on the feet after a disastrous flop and is definitely better (Megadeth\u2019s \u201cThe World Needs a Hero\u201d, Annihilator\u2019s \u201cKing of the Kill\u201d) than some although it fares a bit less well compared to others (\u201cHelloween\u2019s \u201cMaster of the Rings\u201d, Kreator\u2019s \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d). The Swiss legends washed away the shame from their repertoire to an extent, even more so with the comeback opus \u201cMonotheist\u201d, and although it\u2019s not very likely that their creative output would grow bigger in the future, their tales of morbidity, pandemonium, vanity, etc. have long since won their rightful place on the metal pantheon.\n",
        "\nI don't exactly know why, but to me it always seemed as if \"Emperor's Return\" was doomed to live a tough life in the shadow of \"Morbid Tales\". Maybe the shock effect of the first EP could not be created again. Okay, already Hellhammer had attacked with uttermost ugliness, but only after the change of name, Tom G. Warrior and his partners in crime (rest in peace, Martin E. Ain) received bigger attention. Moreover, the ridiculous artwork was not helpful in order to promote the EP. Anyway, \"Emperor's Return\" marks a very solid work. In hindsight, it can be understood as the logical link between \"Morbid Tales\" and \"To Mega Therion\", because it combines elements of both outputs. It's not as raw as \"Morbid Tales\" and it does not possess the opulence of tracks such as \"Necromantical Screams\" from their first full-length. Nevertheless, five regular tracks form a compact unit and the listener is not confronted with weird experiments like \"Danse Macabre\" or \"Tear in a Prophet's Dream\".\n\nThe most popular track is certainly \"Circle of the Tyrants\" due to its brutal yet catchy main riff and additionally in view of the fact that this roughshod anthem was also part of the following album. Here we have the slightly weaker version with some dubious voice effects, but there can be no question that exactly songs like this one are the reason why Hellhammer / Celtic Frost became such an influential formation for later generations of metal musicians. It connects bitterness with desperation and darkness while its musical frame finds the balance between accessibility and excitement. However, I admit that I prefer \"Morbid Tales\" (the track), because its dynamic and almost smooth up-tempo parts impress me. The screams of Warrior prove evidence that he can say more than just \"Ugh\" and he asks the mother of all questions: \"Are you morbid?\" Well, guess I have to add a \"yes\" here.\n\nBut the band itself is definitely more morbid. The ironclad, heavyweight guitars deliver some very degenerated tones and it comes as no surprise that thousands of death and black metal standard-bearers refer to the Swiss trio when it comes to their inspiration. Celtic Frost's early works satisfy the needs of both sides. Of course, don't expect filigree contours. It's a very rumbling approach that they offer, but exactly the non-perfect production lends the EP an authentic touch. The cold lake was still light years away and even the avant-garde sounds of \"Into the Pandemonium\" did not yet play a role. Celtic Frost were raw, honest and headstrong. In particular the stubborn solos mirrored the very individual demeanor of the three dudes. In my humble opinion, it was to their advantage that they had grown up in a very isolated surrounding where external influences were rare. No doubt, albeit \"Emperor's Return\" does not mark a milestone in the history of the band, it reflects the innovative strength and the originality of the legend very well.\n",
        "\nI consider myself pretty forgiving when it comes to glam metal. Some of it can be cheesy and hammy, but it's still such a fun and energetic genre to me, and I admire a ton of it. I'm a fan of bands like Dokken, Poison, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Kiss, Twisted Sister you name it. I even adore Pantera's first 4 albums, and consider Metal Magic to be one of the all-time standards for how to make glam metal well. So when I kept hearing things about Celtic Frost's attempt at glam metal, Cold Lake, being as despised and reviled as it is, I was more than ready to give it a shot. I'd never heard a full Celtic Frost song before this, and apart from knowing that they were black metal, I had no prior experience with them. So I had no serious bias going into this. I wanted to love Cold Lake. I truly did. I wanted this to be the little album that could; to be that one hidden gem which deserves another chance at glory someday.\n\nBut in the end, I just can't enjoy this album on most levels. Even without many expectations going into it, Cold Lake still let me down. Let's start with my biggest issue: It's bland. REALLY bland. The guitar riffs (if you can call them that) are forgettable, generic, and they don't have the same type of memorable melody or hooks that other glam bands had perfected around this same time period. There aren't any songs where I can easily hum the riff or sing along with the chorus, because it all just kind of blends together to me. Cherry Orchards comes the closest to having a legitimate hook, but it still sounds like a watered down version of Seek and Destroy by Metallica. Seduce Me, Downtown Hanoi and Little Velvet also sound like they have potentially adequate riffs trying to get out, but other than that, this stuff just puts me to sleep. Some of the guitar solos are all right, but nothing remarkable either. They just kind of meander around and don't go for any of the flashy presence I was hoping for.\n\nThe second biggest issue I have with Cold Lake is the singing. It's painfully obvious that this type of music isn't Tom Warrior's strong point, nor is it in his comfort zone. Normally I'd applaud any band willing to go outside of what they're used to, but this simply didn't work out or pay off at all. When I think of glam metal, I think of strong and charismatic vocals, memorable harmonized choruses, and a singing range that can go from high to low on a dime. But Tom just doesn't sound like he can pull that off here. He sounds very gruff, monotone and even uncomfortable at times. His voice seems like it's straining to hit any \"high notes\" on this, and he's trying his damndest to sound sleazy when it just comes off as awkward. For some of these songs, I question if there was even a chorus at all in them. Calling them \"out of place\" doesn't even begin to cover it. I haven't heard much else of Celtic Frost's catalogue, so it isn't my place to judge Tom as an overall singer on this, especially because I know this is nowhere near Celtic Frost's typical style. But from what I did hear on their other albums, he sounds just fine. Still gruff, baritone and hoarse, but on the other records there's a certain aggressiveness and energy to it, and it fits with the darker metal they're known for. It definitely had its place. But here, he sounds bored and tired a lot of the time, and that's the last thing you should sound like if you want to shoot for glam metal's fun, party style.\n\nIf there's anything I can kind of complement on this record, the drumming is fine. I like the use of the cymbals at times (yes, this is how far I have to stretch for a positive), and it sounds about the same as most 80s drum tones did. But like with the guitar playing, the drums also don't do that much outside of the bare necessities either. They keep time well enough and occasionally do something neat, but they're just adequate. One of the bonus tracks, Tease Me, has some energy going on behind the kit, which is nice. But it's too little too late by then. The same thing goes for the bass too. A lot of times it was hard to even hear, so it's tough for me to assess it. The bass I did hear sounded just like the drums did: Adequate. Production-wise, Cold Lake is all right. As stated before, the bass is kind of buried at times, but other than that I don't hear any real errors. It sounds like the standard 80s fare with the slightly echo-ey feel to the drums and vocals, the guitar tone is kind of glossy, and the mixing is mostly okay too. Lyrically, there's not a whole lot to say. They're kind of dark by glam metal standards, which could've been unique and interesting for the genre, but they just don't leave any impression on me. One thing I noticed is that when I went to look up the lyrics, a bunch of songs had no results, which is bizarre. They clearly aren't instrumentals, so I don't know what's going on with that. But with the lyrics I did find, yeah, they're about as bland as the music they go with. Something about wine here, dancing there, and a whole bunch of other nonsensical, directionless drivel that doesn't make any sense. Of course lyrics don't always need to make sense to get some good or fun songs, but the lyrics I could find for Cold Lake's songs just left me scratching my head wondering what these guys were thinking when they were writing them.\n\nI can absolutely see where a lot of the vitriol towards Cold Lake comes from. It's a dull, forgettable, unremarkable and boring album that does almost nothing worth remembering. I couldn't even make this review as long as I wanted it to be, because there's just that little to really say about it. I'm mostly unfamiliar with Celtic Frost, so if even I could be disappointed by this album, then I can only imagine how awful this must've been for the band's more hardcore fans. I've read that this album was made with a whole new lineup, and I've heard from many that this was nothing but a sell-out move on their part. I don't know if I'd say that, however. For an extreme metal band like them, it must've (at the time) seemed like an incredibly risky move to try and dip their feet into the sea of commercialized hair metal. While it obviously failed and fell flat in most ways imaginable, I at least have a touch of respect for Cold Lake as an attempt to try something new. I would rather see any band try something different and fail than to play it safe for their entire careers. In the end, however, there's not much else I can say in its defense. As an attempt to give the glam scene a try, it just didn't work for them. Plenty of other artists and bands from this era were able to work with a more \"commercial\" sound with great success for a while (in my opinion), so it's not like this couldn't have worked. There was honest to God potential for good music to come out of this. I'll say it again: I wanted Cold Lake to be the little album that could. \n\nBut unfortunately, it couldn't.\n",
        "\nOn To Mega Therion, Swiss metallers Celtic Frost manage to take a would-be monotonous and repetitive proto-death metal record and make it memorable as well as epic. Finally recovering from the negative reception of previous project Hellhammer, guitarist, vocalist, and riffmaking genius Tom Gabriel Warrior created a metal classic in this album that will eternally be remembered for its undeniably heavy and original sound. \n\nWarrior's vocals have a sense of raw power to them. While the lyrics are barely discernible, they are barked out in an aggressive way that would soon evolve into the guttural styles of bands like Obituary and Morbid Angel. Drummer Reed St. Mark's rhythms are percussive and hard-hitting yet simplistic, but they get the job done and they do it well. Bassists Dominic Steiner and the late great Martin Eric Ain (who played on three of the album's tracks) perfectly bridge the gap between Warrior's riffs and St. Mark's drumming. The album also features some innovative yet unconventional moments throughout, such as Wolf Bender's French horn and Claudia-Maria Mokri's operatic falsetto, both of which would help define the subgenre of avant-garde metal which Celtic Frost are often labelled.\n\nThere are a variety of stylistic variations throughout this album, with all of them doing nothing but adding to the overall appeal of the record. From the doom-laden intro song \"Innocence and Wrath\" to the odd mechanical clicking of \"Tears In a Prophet's Dream,\" every song track has something to offer the metal world. \"The Usurper\" and \"Jewel Throne\" feature an original storyline written by Tom Warrior, and feature original Frost bassist Martin Ain on the recordings. Songs like \"Eternal Summer\" and \"(Beyond The) North Winds\" showcase the thrashier side of the group, while \"Dawn of Megiddo\" (often misspelled \"Meggido\") sees the trio slowing down for a darker, more haunting tune. \"Circle of the Tyrants\" is an extreme metal classic, having been covered by Obituary and Opeth. \"Necromantical Screams\" is an epic and perfect closing track, filled with Mokri's creepy falsetto. The whole album is punctuated by Warrior's grunting \"ooh\"s, which he uses frequently throughout the album and have been adopted by John Tardy, Chuck Schuldiner, and David Vincent.\n\nThe new remastered and reissued version of the album also features a handful of songs from the band's Emperor's Return EP as well as a remixed version, an unreleased track, and a studio jam. My personal favorites of these are \"Visual Aggression\" and \"Suicidal Winds,\" although the Return version of \"Circle of the Tyrants\" is pretty kickass as well.\n\nThe reissue also comes with excessive and uselessly repetitive band photos, and a track-by-track review written by Xavier Russell, a guy who interviewed the band shortly after the album was released in 1985. These are pointless, as this beautiful masterpiece of an album is perfect by itself. I managed to find this on CD at my local record store for $12, and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. Sadly, Martin Eric Ain passed away shortly after; although he only played on a few of the album's tracks, he did help write quite a few more and he deserves more respect than he gets from extreme metal fans. This album is well-worth a listen from anyone who hasn't had a chance yet.\n",
        "\nBy the time Celtic Frost got around to making this album, the Swedish wrecking crew had grown an almost unbelievable amount since their Hellhammer days, which still weren\u2019t far behind them. While it was easy to see shades of the former group in To Mega Therion, the album also demonstrated a great deal of maturation and stylistic evolution. While this release is still almost as rough and dirty as the band had always been, Frost had learned to hone its vision and fashion its rage and vigor into something primal, apocalyptic, and downright artful. Boasting an epic, sulphur-filled atmosphere of pure menace that would make Black Sabbath's ghostly muses piss themselves in fright, To Mega Therion is Celtic Frost's crowning achievement. \n\nThe fact that this release's influence on the metal scene is difficult to overstate is both obvious and well-earned. An album at least 90 times more sinister than any that came before it, To Mega Therion combines the most evil aspects of numerous subgenres, some of which were barely even in their fetal stages at the time, and distills it into a solid mass of scorching fury. Its faster riffs, like the one that crashes into you near the middle of \u2018Jewel Throne\u2019 and the one that kicks in about twenty seconds into \u2018Eternal Summer\u2019 are bombastic and deadly while its slower riffs, like the ones making up most of 'Dawn of Megiddo' ooze a tense, doom-foretelling negativity that would make Electric Wizard jealous. While, even in its fastest moments, the album never approaches the speed of, say Metallica's 'Whiplash', To Mega Therion's strength and aggression is never in question. \n\nBut this classic isn't just about sonic violence. To Mega Therion is surprisingly sophisticated on a compositional level for an album from a band that was releasing material of the utmost rawness and primitivity as Hellhammer only one year prior. While most analyses call attention to the echoes of this album's blistering riffwork that can be heard everywhere from Darkthrone to Evile and even Nirvana, To Mega Therion treats listeners to some more disciplined and classically inspired passages, certainly no less influential, from time to time. The opening track hints at this, with its mood-setting parade of doom-laden riffs reaching a new level of grandiosity with the horns and keyboard orchestration that accompanies it. The slow, moody intro to 'Dawn of Megiddo' and the ominous choir effects later on in the song both expertly build the tension and provide an air of magnificence without ever backing away from the nastiness at this album\u2019s core. Final track \u2018Necromantical Screaming\u2019, meanwhile, perhaps takes its bizarre accompaniment to the greatest extreme, juxtaposing its slow, Sabbath-esque riffs with the sort of operatic wailing and Wagnerian phrasing that brings images of an impending Armageddon to mind.\n\nEvery performance on To Mega Therion is razor sharp. Tom's riffs are as deadly as they've ever been, no matter their speed. For the solos, he manages to get the most out of his not particularly acrobatic fingers. The solos shift back and forth between simplistic and simplistic but surprisingly ambitious, with the flashier ones often seeming like they\u2019re just barely managing to not fly off the rails. Fully in control of the most sinister and beastly aspects of his voice, Tom barks and snarls his way through each song in a way that perfectly complements the riffs. The drums maintain a thunderous presence while the bass, though often hard to pick out, is strangely unsettling when it\u2019s audible, especially in \u2018Necromantical Screams\u2019. \n\nA monumental improvement over the amateurish but moderately satisfying demos they were putting out as Hellhammer and a height of songwriting brilliance none of their future releases would match, To Mega Therion is Celtic Frost at the height of its power. While the presence of the underwhelming interlude \u2018Tears in a Prophet\u2019s Dream\u2019 and the general lack of catchiness might give rise to some criticism, To Mega Therion\u2019s heady mix of violent riffing and classically-inspired embellishments still feels fresh today and will be just as fresh tomorrow so long as the world doesn\u2019t end before then.\n",
        "\nIn the first few years of their post-Hellhammer career, Celtic Frost did quite a bit of climbing up the ladder of musical innovation. To Mega Therion was a dirty and vicious slab of white-hot aggression and Into The Pandemonium brought a good deal of experimentation to their formula. Then, when they'd risen to the top of that metaphorical ladder, Frost proceeded to fall face-first down it, striking its collective nose painfully on each rung and fracturing its skull on the cold concrete floor beneath. Rather than pursuing either of their previously established molds farther, the band followed their earlier underground albums up with a poorly-conceived, poorly-written, and poorly-executed attempt at mainstream success that is rightly seen as a betrayal of their fans and by far the worst mistake of Tom G. Warrior's career (for people who don't know about the obscure Frost demo/trash heap known as Prototype).\n\nThis album fails whether you\u2019re a Celtic Frost fan or a hair metal enthusiast. On one hand, most of these riffs and chord progressions are banal and far beneath what these Swiss pioneers are capable of. The bruising riffs, sinister atmosphere and fiery drumwork from To Mega Therion are barely here and, as a result, the dark, evil persona that makes the band's debut full-length so much fun is absent. On the other hand, people who like Poison and Warrant won\u2019t like this either because the music still has too much of Frost\u2019s signature griminess. The evil vibes Frost was known for still manage to creep into the release enough to keep it from ever satisfying any of the weirdos who actually like \u2018Cherry Pie\u2019. The power chords are too loud and fuzzy for what the band is trying to do here, not that what they\u2019re trying to do is at all commendable. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to know what glam metal would sound like with the rough production of actual metal, you might want to check this album out solely for research purposes because the results of combining those two is not enjoyable.\n\nTom\u2019s vocal style, as in every other ill-fated Celtic Frost sonic experiment, does quite a bit of damage here. Plenty of hard rock vocalists have gone for a sleazy stage presence over the years and, with this in mind, Tom\u2019s voice is still far too coarse and slimy to make the attempts at fist pumping choruses in the likes of \u2018Cherry Orchards\u2019 and \u2018Downtown Hanoi\u2019 work, not that any of these choruses would be good with a different singer. His voice takes the form of an incredibly weak, croaking whine, lacking the range, dynamism, volume, and lung capacity to attempt anything resembling an operatic wail or even a competent melodic verse. Even when the other band members or some session singer named Michelle Villanueve chip in, their performances are half-hearted at best, failing to breathe any amount of life into these limp choruses and hollow verses.\n\nEvery now and then something that sounds like a semblance of the old Frost clinging to life can be heard. A few of the riffs in \u2018(Once) They Were Eagles\u2019 and a slow, tension-building motherfucker in \u2018Downtown Hanoi\u2019 are among the best musical ideas on the album but aren't enough to save even the songs they\u2019re featured in. When a slightly muscular riff you can be somewhat proud of appears, the grimy production actually fits the music, except the snare drum's irritating, hollow tone. There are actually a few sinister riffs that are pretty good (if you can ignore Tom\u2019s misguided attempts at sounding seductive with his weird frog voice) scattered throughout, though of course, they don't fit in with the overall product on display.\n\nAnother strength this album has is its absolute lack of catchiness. I\u2019d certainly be a lot more miserable right now if I had any of this material stuck in my head. There\u2019s also no ballad. Now, you might be saying, \u201cHow can you count something that\u2019s not there as a plus?\u201d If so, you clearly haven\u2019t thought about what Tom Warrior singing a goddamn ballad, which is already the worst type of hair metal song, would sound like. If such a thing has occurred to you, then you know that the world dodged a hail of bullets there. And not just regular bullets. Big, armor-piercing ones dipped in black mamba venom.\n\nAside from what the last two paragraph call attention to, nothing about Cold Lake works. The band shows a bit of promise with several riffs that are a little too good for most hair metal albums but sinks its own ship with its execution and all the contradictions inherent in its paradoxical existence. Wanting chart success is understandable but who the hell thought that could be achieved with Tom\u2019s dehydrated old pervert voice hissing all over everything with no sense of tune or rhythm? Or with a complete absence of ear-catching choruses? Or the dirty production? What Cold Lake ends up as is a bastard child that inherited only the absolute worst traits of both parents. The writing is too insultingly simplistic and vapid for Celtic Frost and the tone and delivery too abrasive and slimy for hair metal. If you decide to listen to this, it will become clear almost right away why Tom tries to pretend this album doesn't exist.\n",
        "\nPerhaps the first metal album that can accurately be described as \u201cweird as hell,\u201d Into the Pandemonium was a trailblazer in avant-garde metal. This release must have been a shock when it first came out, with its numerous sonic experiments pulling Celtic Frost in a bunch of different directions, most of which no one had even imagined before. Throughout, there are plenty of bizarre, groundbreaking pieces, though the band\u2019s execution of its own ideas doesn\u2019t always pay off. The quality of the album varies greatly from one track to the next, with several songs dragging the whole experience down quite a bit with their ill-conceived strangeness. \n\nIn general, Pandemonium has an unsettling feel to it that stretches across most of its runtime. The riffs are more restrained than they\u2019d been on past Frost outings and are typically accompanied by classical orchestration ranging from grandiose to eerie to straight-up dissonant, ghostly choirs, and industrial ideas. The all out riff-based carnage from To Mega Therion is gone, replaced instead by calmer, albeit less creative, riffs buttressed by the experimentation going on.\n\nOnly two of these pieces could be considered to be great all the way through. 'Inner Sanctum' is the song that deviates from Frost\u2019s established M.O. the least, built as it is on some meaty riffs and Tom\u2019s malevolent snarls. The out-of-nowhere cover of \u2018Mexican Radio\u2019 (how did such an idea even occur to the band?) that starts off the album is a triumph as well, featuring some tight, energetic playing and a rockin\u2019 vibe with a layer of the band\u2019s usual filth layered on top. With an ominous choir effect accompanying a fast backbeat between the first chorus and the second verse, the cover even manages to squeeze in some foreshadowing of the weirdness to unfold throughout the rest of the album.\n\nEvery other song here has glaring faults, even the ones that are good overall. Providing a concise impression of the entire release, due to its variety, is impossible so I\u2019ll just spin off a few of the pieces that stand out the most. 'Mesmerized' is the first sign of trouble, with its slow, sparse instrumentation, the odd note progressions and dissonant weirdness of which don't do much to distract from the sluggish pace. \u2018Sorrows of the Moon\u2019 is similarly constructed, though it features Tom reciting an English translation of a Charles Baudelaire poem. Not singing. Reciting. Tom must have been high on horse tranquilizers when he recorded this because his vocal performance is so weak and garbled that I, a native English speaker, couldn\u2019t tell that the recitation was in English until about halfway through (another attempt at this general idea, featured on some versions of the album, has some woman recite the poem in French while a string quartet provides some truly unnerving orchestration, and is much more effective and better thought out). This album\u2019s obvious weak point, \u2018One in their Pride\u2019 is essentially a looped industrial drumbeat with a bunch of crackling audio from the Apollo 11 mission thrown overtop, accompanied by the occasional dissonant note or chord from a bowed instrument. This number is quite irritating in its repetition and insistence on cluttering up the mix with all the NASA transmissions, not that they're obscuring anything all that worthwhile. 'I Won't Dance' shows some Motown inspiration in its unforgettable chorus, where Tom and a group of female soul singers trade vocal lines. However, this song's quality is diminished somewhat by lazy vocals and lackluster instrumentation throughout most of the verses.\n\nThough the experiments with unexpected musical influences are at least commendable, borne as they are out of a desire to expand metal\u2019s boundaries even if they don\u2019t always work, Tom does a lot of damage to the album just with his voice, which he foolishly decided to try branching out with. Tom\u2019s vocals are only satisfactory when they exist in the form of a gross bark. Sadly, about 40 percent of his vocal lines are delivered in this weird attempt at\u2026something. Sometimes he sounds like a sick old guy trying to do an impression of a pretentious Shakespearean actor (you know the stereotype\u2014imagine the porcupine thespian in Toy Story 3), resulting in what seems more like a monologue than singing. Sometimes, he sounds like he\u2019s imitating those lazy grunge vocals that hadn\u2019t been invented yet while having an unsatisfying orgasm. This weird approach to singing is unengaging, off-putting, and a serious hindrance to the album\u2019s flow, which is rendered stilted and awkward throughout the entirety of 'Mesmerized' and parts of several other songs, simply because Tom didn\u2019t have the sense to realize his voice sounds horrible in every context that doesn\u2019t involve howling or grunting his way through a song. \n\nFrost's willingness to go so far out of its comfort zone in the name of innovation should be applauded for what it means conceptually, even if Tom's skills as a composer and singer aren't always up to the task of making it work in practice. Pandemonium's songs show a great deal of vision that was far too ambitious from the beginning for the band to fulfill. Despite the group's best efforts and plenty of moments where the bizarre mixture of metal, ambiance, and gothic orchestration is more than satisfying, ultimately we're left with an album that's a little too weird for its own good.\n",
        "\nThe history of Celtic Frost (one of the most impressive band names of all times) is full of tragedies and \"Cold Lake\" is only the most obvious one. \"Into the Pandemonium\" stands as a synonym for a battle that the band could not win. Right from the beginning, Tom G. Warrior and his sidekicks were doomed to failure, because the concept of the album brought the band to its knees. This was no wonder in view of the circumstances of the recording session, because Noise Records had the phenomenal idea to interrupt the creative process in order to send the band on a tour with the multi-coloured nutcases called Anthrax. Furthermore, Noise owner Walterbach hated the new songs, Tom hated Walterbach, the band had asked in vain for another producer and everyone was against everyone. Only a well-oiled machine, a firm unit, could have mastered the challenging concept in view of these difficulties, but Celtic Frost were fighting on several fronts at the same time. \"Damn the Machine - the Story of Noise Records\", written by an American author, tells the whole story about the complicated relationship between the band and the record label from Berlin.\n\n\"To Mega Therion\", the mighty predecessor of \"Into the Pandemonium\" had some fantastic innovative elements, but the here presented work goes many steps too far. Where is the mystic darkness, where is the occult heaviness, where is the overwhelming desolation? \"Into the Pandemonium\" meanders through different styles, from the airy \"Mexican Radio\" over the more or less commercial \"I Won't Dance\" to the senseless industrial / disco bastard \"One in Their Pride\" with its sterile and completely worthless hammering. Isn't this enormous variety wonderful? No, it isn't. It's just bullshit, although \"I Won't Dance\" has a certain flair because of its unusual combination of sad lyrics with a soft melody line. Yet it has nothing in common with the musical statements of \"To Mega Therion\", \"Morbid Tales\" or \"Emperor's Return\" and it dwells more than thousand miles away from the core and the values of Celtic Frost. I believe that Tom Warrior has put heart and soul into these pretty well produced songs, nevertheless, I don't like them and many other fans also did not enjoy the album. A tragedy, as mentioned above.\n\nAnd that's not all. The songs which do not scream for individuality at any cost do not convince as well. Just listen to the foppish singing style of Tom during \"Mesmerized\", is this an early form of gothic rock? Even the pieces that build a connection to the band's former releases, for example the more or less evil and doubtlessly heavy \"Inner Sanctum\", pale beside their classics, because the riffs are just too weak and the songs do not offer these majestic yet horrifying vibes that lent \"Necromantical Screams\" or \"The Usurper\" their colossal size. \"Babylon Fell\" marks another example of a pretty solid and ultra-heavy track that unfortunately lacks of compelling lines and exciting elements. By contrast, \"Caress into Oblivion\" marks my first personal climax of the album. It presents a nice mixture of a lament and a mid-paced neckbreaker. The accusing voice of Tom fits the musical approach very well and the memorable chorus crowns the song. My second favourite track emphasises the bombastic side of the band. \"Rex Irae (Requiem)\" has this morbid touch that sends shivers down my spine. The duet of Tom and opera singer Claudia-Maria Mokri , the partly orchestral instrumentation and the sawing guitars form a majestic yet moribund masterpiece. Finally, the following outro marks a positive finish of a disappointing album. Indeed, the fantastic design of the gatefold cannot conceal the truth: \"Into the Pandemonium\" is an overambitious work. The courage of the band deserves respect, but the experiment itself has gone wrong.\n\nMartin Eric Ain says in the Celtic Frost documentary \"A Dying God\" that it was his biggest mistake to be not involved in the recording of \"To Mega Therion\". To add insult to injury, he could also have mentioned the other side of the coin, his involvement in the recording of the here presented flop. Tragedies as far as the eye can see.\n",
        "\nThe often mixed results of bands shifting from their earlier, unrefined and direct styles to more ambitious experimentation should be no stranger to anyone familiar with metal, the larger realm of rock music or even popular music generally. Bands get together, play some simple stuff with youthful abandon, then mature and grow tired of their classic sound and move on to stranger territory. Celtic Frost are not only an extremely notable example of this sort of thing in the sphere of metaldom, they've also managed to do it a somewhat staggering number of times. From the poorly-planned \"Mexican Radio\" cover that for some reason kicked off Into the Pandemonium, to the half-assed glam cash-in of Cold Lake, to that incredibly awful 2002 demo with a song called \"Hip Hop Jugend,\" Tom Warrior's no stranger to failed experiments.\n\nThen there's Monotheist. Hailed by many at the time (and in the eleven years since) as the comeback to end all comebacks, the album is a gigantic slab of doomy, crushing extreme metal that takes the classic riff-heavy early Celtic Frost sound, the one everyone from Darkthrone to Autopsy has placed on a pedestal most high, and does three things with it. First, the running time and track lengths utterly dwarf prior Frost albums, showing right away that they've set out to do something on a much grander scale than ever before. Second, they've married those old Frost-isms to a more refined and much more heavily emphasized gothic atmosphere that's like a more terrifying, inhuman perversion of Type O Negative. But thirdly, and most noticeable right out of the gate, they've taken pains to find the most absolutely perfect production one could possibly imagine for music like this. There's a huge amount of space in the mix despite how loud everything is, every instrument clear and distinct and vital. The attention to sonic detail is so painstaking that I can't help but draw some similarities between this and Trent Reznor's notorious acoustic perfectionism in Nine Inch Nails (just listen to \"Drown in Ashes\" out of context if you don't believe me). But the guitar tone, good fucking lord that guitar tone.\n\nIt's probably the most talked-about part of this whole affair, and it has earned every word of discussion. Never before had such unruly, feedback-soaked, extremely high-gain guitar tone been captured with such brutal clarity. The guitars are just goddamn unhinged in their extremity of tone, showing just how devastatingly heavy electric guitars can sound with the mids cranked through the goddamn roof instead of the increasingly prevalent scooped or bass-heavy tones. When used to convey those signature Frost riffs such as the churchburning stomp of opener \"Progeny\" or the towering ogre that is \"Os Abysmi Vel Daath,\" the result couldn't really be more pleasing to the ear. I guess it's pretty simple, really - it's just Tubescreamer-driven bigass amps with a hell of a lot of overdrive, in the classic 80's style, but loud as shit and sitting right inside otherwise modern, crystal-clear production that somehow adds extra bloody violence to the guitar tone rather than scrubbing it clean and sterilizing it. Truly revelatory guitar sound.\n\nSo, now that that's all out of the way, the sad necessity of explaining how I think all of these things I've mentioned somehow combine to make a whole that is far less than the sum of its parts must be undertaken. Both on paper and in any given moment during Monotheist's gigantic 68-minute running time, it seems as though the band has succeeded in incorporating this trifecta of changes into an otherwise \"return to the roots\" record that not only managed to please a great many fans of the band's early 80's material but also brought in legions of those who were won over by this album's ambitions that, to them, placed it in a level above that of their more simplistic earlier works. Years of listening to this thing, an album which floored me with its sheer sonic bliss for quite a long while after first listening to it, have fostered a growing resentment about this album's unique failure.\n\nThat failure is simply that the band was largely incapable of really putting that beautiful guitar tone to good use by properly marrying this huge gothic cathedral sound, with its layered distant melodies and vampire bride female backing vocals, to songs that make use of good riffs to maximum effect. Despite the unifying force of the production and Tom's perhaps best ever vocal performance (shocking how well his signature choked yelling works througout this whole thing), there really are just about two completely different songwriting approaches on Monotheist: songs with riffs, and songs with no riffs. \"Progeny,\" \"Ground,\" \"Os ABysmi Vel Daath,\" \"Domain of Decay,\" and \"Ain Elohim\" and the second \"Triptych\" track all have riffs, the other songs do not. Yeah, ok, one could argue I'm being a bit restrictive about what counts as a \"riff\" and what doesn't, but the difference in songwriting approach between these two styles of songs could not be more obvious to me.\n\nThat there are two different songwriting styles is not a problem in an of itself, but highlights the real issue. I swear I am not the type of guy to nod in approval at some Dark Angel-esque riff count declaration sticker, but those more aggressive, riff-oriented songs are just sorta frighteningly spare, often repeating the same guitar lines just over and over and over again, really wearing out their sometimes bloated track lengths. \"Progeny\" is like if your entire body were a mucous membrane and then you jumped into a sandbox filled with cocaine then immediately started a bareknuckle boxing match to the death with your best friend, but then it goes on for five minutes with almost no variation and just wears down on your eardrums. Even \"Ain Elohim,\" which is probably the best of the riffier tracks on here, due in no small part to its more deft rift transitions, begins to drag after three minutes, let alone seven and a half.\n\nThen there are the non-riff songs. The best of these is without a doubt \"A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh,\" which still has me wondering what Martin Ain is up to eleven years after the fact. \"Obscured\" sounds like a Pop-era U2 song with the jangly guitars replaced with ho-hum powerchords. The atmosphere conjured on these things is for the most part pretty great, but paired with the aforementioned lack of dynamics in the riffy songs, the entirety of the whole thing has become clear to me: the opportunity to well-and-truly drape the riff-centric Frostisms of yore with this newfound gothic beauty/horror hybrid sound was definitely missed on Monotheist. It just took me quite a long time to come to terms with this, as my love affair with the guitar tone and soundscapes on this album was not an easy thing to hear beyond. The only place where the two disparate halves of the album's approach really come together in a satisfying way is in the first half of the second \"Triptych\" track, but those are bookended by overlong intro/outro bits and unnecessary meandering that bloats the length of this track into the realm of the taxing.\n\nThe greatest disappointment surrounding this album, for me, is not only its gradually-revealed dearth of ideas and successes, but how instead of leading to a more refined and better executed follow-up, the band instead finally fell apart for good and Tom went on to try to recapture this album's success in Triptykon with even less compelling results. It still sounds great, without a doubt, but it's difficult to revisit this album without wondering what might've been.\n",
        "\nI wasn\u2019t going to write this review, but a friend of mine challenged me saying that I couldn\u2019t pen down something less positive being a most avid metal fan. Well, I have chosen to sing odes to my favourite bands and albums here (well, not exactly) leaving the negative reviews for my site, and I see nothing bad in that. There\u2019s certainly a fair number of albums that I genuinely dislike, to put it mildly, but it took me awhile before I settled down on one. \n\nThe main reason why I chose the Frosts\u2019 \u201cpioneering\u201d work was that a few weeks back I was sitting down, listening to the Hellhammer demos, pondering over the gigantic metamorphosis this band had experienced in the span of mere five years\u2026 the fastest road down to complete fiasco in the annals of metal. One could have seen them riding the top of the death metal, or the gothic/doom wave in the-90's, but nothing like this \"sleazy hollow\" that we, the fans, have been staring at for over 30 years now.\n\nI juxtaposed other bands\u2019 trajectories from the beginning to the flop: it took Metallica 13 years (\u201cKill\u2019em All\u201d/\u201dLoad\u201d), Accept 10 years (self-titled/\u201dEat the Heat\u201d), Destruction 10 years (\u201cSentence of Death\u201d/\u201dDestruction\u201d), Anthrax 12 years (\u201cFistful of Metal\u201d/\u201cStomp 442\u201d), Megadeth 14 years (\u201cKilling is My Business\u2026\u201d/\u201dRisk\u201d), Helloween 10 years (\u201cHelloween\u201d/\u201dChameleon\u201d), Overkill 8 years (\u201cFeel the Fire\u201d/\u201dI Hear Black\u201d), Exodus 7 years (\u201cBonded by Blood\u201d/\u201dForce of Habit\u201d), Bulldozer 7 years (\u201cThe Day of Wrath\"/the horrible \u201dDance Got Sick!\u201d)\u2026 yes, Celtic Frost were pioneers indeed; they provided the shortcut to the total career disaster, before anyone else had ever thought about such \"infinite possibilities\". Thumbs up.\n\nI was never the band\u2019s biggest fan, but I admired their aggressive adventurous spirit reflected in the Hellhammer atrocities and the first steps they made under the new moniker (\u201cMorbid Tales\u201d), the first EP\u2019s I listened to from this new/old camp some time in the late-80\u2019s. Then the next thing I remember is my poor self exposed to the sounds from \u201cCold Lake\u201d; this guy who gave it to me put the utmost effort to convince me that those were the same guys who were parading a few years back as Hellhammer, and were horrifying the world with their unbridled brutalities. This was the first time when I felt uneasy seeing how my favourite music could actually be subjected to such awkward transformations. \u201cWhat the fuck happened?!\u201d, I wondered, and logically decided to track down the previous efforts, between \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d and this\u2026 there had to be a seed planted earlier somewhere for this travesty to fully bloom... cause, man, was it blooming with all the colours of the rainbow!\n\nI liked \u201cTo Mega Therion\u201d quite a bit, I have to admit; and I still listen to it on regular bases. This is where the actual innovative arrangements and additives had been exhibited for the first time. After I heard the album reviewed here I was sure that it was the \u201ctrash can\u201d of its predecessor where the band had thrown away the needless material. It\u2019s a big mess out here, no organization, no order, exactly the way one would feel rummaging through a recycle bin. On the positive side, you\u2019d be able to realise all your fantasies, anything you desire, from \u201cOriental masquerades\u201d to \u201cMexican radios\u201d (no Thai massage though), all within an arm\u2019s stretch. A mish-mash of the highest disorder, I tell you\u2026 with a twist.\n\nSo our revered Swiss masters decide to open this most earth-shattering of albums with a cover; now that\u2019s a novelty by all means, of course; but what\u2019s more interesting is that they have chosen the hit of one of the most obscure entities known to the metal world in order to make the five metal heads who have heard the original cry their hearts out with nostalgic crocodile tears, with the fond childhood memories from the good old days when they were barely 3-4 years old\u2026 a poignant, really poignant moment from metal history, and I can\u2019t help but take a short break and wipe those tears of mine although I\u2019ve never ever listened to the original; so please, make your own conclusions about the timeless significance of this \u201cMexican Radio\u201d with which I instantly replaced the \"Chinese Radio\" I bought from some London Boys around the same time.\n\nGround-breaking stuff so far, and we\u2019ve only been through one song; I guess we leave the rest for another day cause this is really too much to take at one go. All right, fine; we soldier on: if the Wall of Voodoo cover has failed to mesmerize you with its voodoo dolls\u2026 sorry, spells, then \u201cMesmerized\u201d should do the trick, a relaxed gothic cut with Tom G. Warrior wailing throughout like someone whose first-time girlfriend has just dumped him. It\u2019s interesting to hear him trying something entirely different vocal-wise, but it\u2019s intimidating at the same time to envisage how far down the \u201cpandemonium\u201d this album can reach. It\u2019s also worth of note that the motifs heard on this \u201cmesmerizing\u201d number are a precursor to the gothic/doom elegies of Paradise Lost; and this is where I start to like this effort a bit which follows with \u201cInner Sanctum\u201d, a pleasing heavy cut which even captures some of the refined aggression of \u201cTo Mega Therion\u201d the Warrior\u2019s vocal bravado brought back with full force. A sigh of relief for sure, but \u201cSorrows of the Moon\u201d will bring more \u201csorrow\u201d, including all the way to the first astronauts on the Moon, being another impotent exercise in atmosphere, providing another template for the future gothic/doom metal hordes not without the help of Warrior\u2019s tear-jerking performance again; but this doesn\u2019t sound as interesting anymore provided that there has already been a very similar track served earlier.\n\n\u201cBabylon Fell\u201d, but not our Swiss friends who persevere with this not bad at all piece where even the good old thrash shows its head courageously to \u201cscold\u201d these new elements that have been \u201cstaining\u201d its reputation here. One may wish the remaining cuts to be \u201cBabylon\u2026\u201d copies, but unfortunately it\u2019s not Christmas time yet for those wishes to come true, and Santa Claus doesn\u2019t come from Switzerland, but from Sweden. Regardless, no hope is lost on \u201cCaress into Oblivion\u201d which aptly captures the galloping vigour of the preceding song Warrior mixing it in the vocal department, creating full-blown gothic drama in the process, to these ears for the better. Two in a row; now that\u2019s a feat to be remembered, and I can\u2019t wait to hear the next cut. \u201cThird time\u2019s a charm\u201d, as they say, but this \u201ccharm\u201d here comes drumming in a scary dancey manner, and I bet quite a few fans out there in the good old days had bet on whether this would be a disco, or a rap anthem: yes, the disillusionment would have reached such proportions towards the end. It\u2019s none of the above, and the bank has to collect all the money; good luck next time as this piece remains a drum-driven extravaganza with voice samples scattered around, setting the scene for the ultimate dance floor sweeper, \u201cI Won\u2019t Dance\u201d. \"You won't dance\" my ass; I'd like to see you sitting still on your chair with these playful rhythms bouncing all around you... It should come as no surprise that Sabrina and Sandra terminated their careers after the release of the album reviewed here (CC Catch survived the threat, though; what an amazing woman!); not surprisingly a female vocalist assists Warrior in creating the definitive \u201cbeauty vs. the beast\u201d duet only that \u201cthe beast\u201d in this case has already been tamed, and at times can even be mistaken for \u201cthe beauty\u201d.\n\nFew would be those to stay with the album after this hit, rushing to the nearest clubs to dance the night away; which would be a real shame since the closing \u201cRex Irae (Requiem)\u201d is an assured doom/gothic metal masterpiece with an outstanding female soprano hovering over Warrior\u2019s tortured wails/moans; one would have no chance, but to adjust his/her senses to an extent to the band\u2019s new face, and if the adjustment has been successful then this \u201crequiem\u201d won\u2019t be such a shock; there were bigger shocks aplenty provided earlier.\n\nYes, I found the source for the \u201ccold lake\u201d, but this didn\u2019t make me happy back then; in fact, it made me quite depressed. I tried to imagine apocalyptic future in which many other thrash, black and death metal acts have followed in the steps of these Swiss pioneers\u2026 Scary picture by all means. I was especially horrified about Coroner, my favourite act, since they grew under Celtic Frost\u2019s wing. To my utter delight, these nightmares never came to pass, at least not instantaneously; the scene wasn\u2019t swept away by a transformational \u201cavalanche\u201d coming from the highest mounts of the Swiss Alps. The former Hellhammers\u2019 ideas didn\u2019t prove contagious, at least not tangibly. They may have influenced Paradise Lost again although this can be disputable as the annals point at other Swiss \u201clecturers\u201d, Messiah, who provided a much more compelling, and more aggressive \u201ctextbook\u201d on gothic drama with the excellent \u201cExtreme Cold Weather\u201d (1988).\n\nSo was this album a pioneering work, after all? Again, that\u2019s debatable; a ground-breaking piece of art should also be judged according to what impact it had on the creators themselves, how it influenced their future endeavours provided that they carried on after it, and didn\u2019t split up. Where did it take them next, is a good question to ask? For example, Beethoven\u2019s 8th Symphony led him to the 9th Symphony, both equally as grandiose musical phenomena (now if this isn\u2019t the most relevant example ever!). Where did this \u201cpandemonium\u201d take Celtic Frost? To the \u201ccold lake\u201d where they drowned, never to be recovered. How much credit can one give to a work of art that ultimately paves the way for the artists\u2019 inevitable \u201csuicide\u201d\u2026 not much, I guess. No wonder \u201cCold Lake\u201d has the lowest score among the works of the top 100 metal bands on the archives here excluding Destruction\u2019s mid-90\u2019s period (but that\u2019s already been denounced, so\u2026). \n\nIt beats me why the band never developed these gothic/doom ideas more fully\u2026 the tendency was already started with \u201cTo Mega Therion\u201d, and those hints that were made here could have become \u201cGothic Lake\u201d on the next instalment, and the guys would have been the flagmen of one of the most massive movements of the 90\u2019s. If this had happened then I was definitely going to give the album reviewed here a higher score. Instead, they gave Paradise Lost the opportunity to bathe in fortune and glory, condemning themselves to oblivion with their choice to join Motley Crue and Cinderella on the other side of the Atlantic by providing the more aggressive analogue to the thriving glam metal \u201csisterhood\u201d.\n\nI believe quite a few Celtic Frost fans must have tried to force themselves into liking this album. They must have struggled self-hypnotizing themselves into tolerating it; they had worshipped at the altar of the Swiss for wholesome 4/5 years, so why denounce all this for the sake of several gothic and dancey motifs? At some stage they had to face the reality, that there were not two acts named Celtic Frost on this planet, and that this new offering was a fact, and that they had to live with it. I wonder whether they had tried a similar \u201ctherapy\u201d for \u201cCold Lake\u201d, too? Nah, self-hypnosis wasn\u2019t going to do the trick there; with that opus one would need a serious expert; a very serious one to help him/her develop even a distant liking to it.\n\nI also felt sorry for \u201cVanity/Nemesis\u201d, a really good album with which the guys tried to restore some dignity posthumously. Alas, very few were those who were still interested in anything coming out of their camp. At least they did release it showing to the listless fanbase that they still had it in them\u2026 \u201cMonotheist\u201d (2006), the comeback saga, was another pretty strong recording although it had very few ties to the band\u2019s older works; at least the dark doomy references were nicely extended and turned into a standalone style; finally. Carving a new path to be walked on\u2026 well, the Warrior has to walk it alone without his colleagues, and under a new name (Triptykon), and judging by the several steps he\u2019s already made, it seems as though he won\u2019t \u201cdance\u201d any time soon\u2026 and this is the rightful option, Tom.\n\nWow, I finished the longest review I\u2019ve ever written for the archives, and yet this is the lowest score I\u2019ve given here so far; paradoxes, paradoxes\u2026 pandemoniums, and then again paradoxes. There\u2019s no logic in this metal world of ours, and the album/band dissected here was one of the earliest proofs of that. I can\u2019t go any lower than that in my evaluation, though; after all, this is Celtic Frost, for crying out loud; not some lunatics full of sorrow from the fucking Moon. And, as I think of it, there were some moments that caught my ears the other day when I was listening to it in order to prepare for the review. It\u2019s not a complete waste after all, so why not give it another go\u2026 but I promise I won\u2019t dance; I won\u2019t fall into the voodoo traps; and I won\u2019t call the Mexican radio DJ\u2019s to give them tips for their playlists. Over and out.\n",
        "\nI am finding it extremely hard to write this on an iPad, but I figured this album was definitely in need of a short review. My laptop took a giant crap on me so for now, this will have to do. Celtic Frost is without a doubt one of the most historically important bands in all of extreme metal. Forming from the ashes of Hellhammer, CF first formed in 1984, combining the sounds of thrash, and early death and black metal to create an unmistakeable sound of chaos and blasphemy. Though, with albums like \"Into the Pandemonium\", it was clear that CF could include experimentation into their sound quite effectively. Sure we had the iffy \"Cold Lake\" and whatever the hell that \"Prototype\" demo was but overall, this group has had a very strong discography. \"Monotheist\" is the final CF album, adopting the style that Tom Warrior would utilize in Triptykon. And wow, is it a monster.\n\nI would like to say that this is my favorite CF album. I know that many would disagree but I don't think this band ever reached this level of darkness, horror, and atmosphere before. The guitars are tuned down extremely low and the production is very sludgy and dirty, making for a very organic sound. There is not a huge amount of technicality and the lack of guitar solos and repetition can attest to this. This is a far cry from classics like \"Morbid Tales\" or \"To Mega Therion\" and seems as if that thrash metal chaos has been completely abandoned but really, this for me remains CF's musical peak. \"A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh\" is perhaps the most well known song here and one of the darkest, most somber numbers. The music video is absolutely freaking strange. A majority of these songs follow similar structures and musical ideas, not really deviating from the horrifyingly dark, simplistic formula. This only makes the album seem like something bigger than itself. Speaking of huge, that \"Synagoga Satanae\" track near the closing of the record is an absolute beast. It is extremely brooding and does offer some variation from aggressors such as \"Progeny\" and \"Ground\". The instrurmemtal ambient closer \"Winter\" is about as hauntingly beautiful as it gets..\n\nThe vocals are also a bit varied ranging from a dark rasp to melodic singing, somewhat of a commonality in doom metal. Warrior has never been one of my favorite vocalists but he does a good job. There are multiple guest slots as well, with a few female vocalists that really add to the atmosphere and Satyr even shows up on \"Synagoga Satanae\", which seems to be the most involved song in terms of vocals.\n\n\"Monotheist\" is one of the scariest albums I have ever heard, rivaling Leviathan's \"The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide\", Sunn O)))'s \"Black One\", and Xasthur's entire discography. It is unfortunate that CF ended on this album but this definitely was a heck of a way to go out.\n",
        "\nHah! Checkmate observer-expectancy effect! Though I will say it's unfortunate that so many others have fallen victim.\n\nI'm not going to praise Cold Lake as if it were the apogee of Frost's discography; because truthfully it's not. It's a step down from their more universally accepted efforts for quite obvious reasons. You won't find any Jewel Thrones or Circle of the Tyrants, but rather a uniquely interesting blend of the signature Celtic Frost essence with a hefty peppering of late 80's sleaze cheese (good sleaze cheese at that). I'm willing to bet that the single digit scores this album receives are given by people who can't stand the thought of a band as sui generis as Celtic Frost sticking their toe in the pools of commerciality; even if just to test the waters.\n\nI suppose I can't totally blame the masses for being too quick to turn their heads, as the album in question starts off, well, questionably. Even taking the stylistic change of direction into consideration, the minute long intro will probably cause you to momentarily inquire, \"Gee, did I leave my Living Colour CD in the disc drive?\" Further exasperating the damage is a number by the name of Seduce Me Tonight. Not an abhorrent track (bar the chorus) but the riffs leave little to be desired. Petty Obsession does little to amend the wound, but then side A concludes with three of the (dare I say?) greatest tracks Cold Lake has to offer. There's not a whole lot to talk about regarding side B, but I assure you there's nothing offensive to be heard.\n\nThe team who engineered and mixed the record didn't do a shabby job either. Curt Bryant's bass has a fair amount of bounce to it, Priestly's drums are punchy, and all of the instruments are prominent without overpowering each other. Performance-wise the band is solid, though Tom's voice isn't exactly compatible with the type of music they set out to play. Like the album itself, there's nothing too offensive about his performance.\n\nSomeone has to say it, and Ill be much obliged to step up and do just that. It's not impressive by any means. But on the flip side; there's nothing astronomically wrong with this album. Yes, I (along with just about everyone else) would have preferred another To Mega Therion; but I'll take what I get and I won't throw a fit. Cold Lake, like the band who birthed it, is a species entirely of it's own. Give the album a listen, best case scenario, you'll find that it's a unique little gem; worst case scenario, you can laugh hysterically at it. Either way I'll be more than happy to defend the album and appreciate it for what it is.\n\nFinal verdict: There's nothing too offensive to be heard, and (Once) They Were Eagles is a badass tune.\n",
        "\nOver the years, some rock bands have made extremely questionable decisions. Discharge going glam metal on Grave New World, Slayer going nu metal on Diabolus en Musica, Dead Kennedys reuniting without Jello Biafra, Phil Anselmo giving his two cents on racial issues (seriously Phil, just stop), Van Halen III ('nuff said), and don't even get me started on why KISS doesn't exist after KISS Alive II in my mind. Hell, even Celtic Frost had one in the form of Cold Lake. Like Discharge, they experimented with hair metal for one album, and like Grave New World, it was awful. But all of those bad decisions are nothing compared to the musical abortion known as Prototype. Even Cold Lake has more artistic merit than this trash.\n\nI have a theory. I think this album consists of rejected demos from Warrior's project Apolloyan Sun. It has to be. That project has more in line than the industrial metal/trip hop elements with which this album experiments than the dark thrash sound of Celtic Frost. This album sounds like it was an April Fools joke but I assure you that it is real. The album goes out of its way to piss off everyone and not in a funny or entertaining way like GG Allin or Stormtroopers of Death would. It features a cover of a \"Helter Skelter\" which is one of my favorite Beatles songs and ruins it. Tom raps the lyrics over a beat that alternates between mindless synth noise and a shitty 4th rate drum 'n' bass beat. It sounds like Raymond Watts featuring on a shitty 21 Pilots song. Yes, Tom raps on this album. Several times actually. Like on the song \"Get Wicked\". This song tries to sound like an 80's Beastie Boys tune but instead just sounds like some idiot yelling incomprehensible gibberish for a minute and a half. There's also Deep Inside where Tom does a drunken Marilyn Manson impression over a beat clearly stolen from Beck's hit \"Loser.\" The song sounds like a really bad rip off of Butthole Surfers' attempt at rap on \"Pepper\", an attempt that went over about 1,000 times better. The song sounds like Sublime going goth except not nearly as funny. \n\nProbably the most hilarious track on the album is \"Hip Hop Jugend\", ironically one of the least hip hop related songs on the album. It sounds like a shitty Laibach song. Tom sounds like he's doing a Til Lindemann impression and there's a random female vocalist on this album that is probably only there because Tom listened to KMFDM and thought that it sounded nice. They even dip into ambient industrial on \"Totgetanzt.\" It starts out okay but it gets ruined when Tom starts whispering in a way that makes me want to cast him in a cartoon based on the Jethro Tull classic \"Aqualung.\" This creepy paedo voice ruins the track, which is further ruined by the dinky hip hop drum machine that kicks in in the last two minutes or so. If you like ambient industrial, go listen to Zoviet France, or Coil or Current 93. Steer clear of this song.\n\nYou're probably wondering: \"Isn't Celtic Frost a METAL band? Where's the Metal?\" Oh, there is some metal here, but it sucks too. It just consists of what sounds like rejected Static X demos. The best track on here is probably \"Beautiful End\" which has a semi-okay guitar riff and drum beat that is dragged down by another shitty vocal performance and it ultimately becomes boring due to its overly repetitive structure. \n\nAnd if Celtic Frost fans aren't pissed off enough by now, the band ensures their legacy is defiled with an electronic music version of \"Danse Macabre\" that's so bad it's horrible. It made Korn Unplugged seem like a good idea. \n\nYou probably noticed that a good chunk of this review is references to other artists. That's because this album insists on ripping of better music. Go listen to Massive Attack and Butthole Surfers and KMFDM and the Beastie Boys. Those guys make music that's actually good. Hell, I hate Korn and Static X, but I'd rather be forced to listen to their trash again than have to listen to this album ever again. This is a massive shitstain on the career of one of the best metal bands to ever exist. I would rank Celtic Frost up their with bands like Black Sabbath and Motorhead in terms of how important and influential they were on heavy metal. The band who is responsible for shaping extreme metal as we know it spent an entire album failing to make an original or interesting musical idea. Process that.\n\nThe best thing about this album was the fact that it was never released. Of course some sadistic fuck leaked it on the internet so I could stumble across it and hear it. If I ever find the asshole(s) who did that, I'm going to have them arrested for crimes against music. \n\nThe worst part about this album is the fact that there is no direction on this thing. It has no one to appeal to. Metal fans are going to hate it because it's absolutely gutless. Hip hop fans are going to hate it because the songs flow like sewage. Industrial fans are going to hate it because it's trying too hard to be mainstream. Goths are going to hate it because it has the personality of a brick wall. This album tries to be angsty, but it just ends up being boring when it's not unintentionally hilarious. \n\nThe best track on the album is probably \"Beautiful End\", if I HAD to pick one. I still wouldn't revisit it. The worst track is definitely \"Get Wicked\" which is unlistenable and borderline arhythmic. \n\nOverall, this album makes me feel like a character in an H.P. Lovecraft story, like I just uncovered some dark and horrifying secret that man was not meant to know. This album has filled me with a deep sadness that even my therapist cannot fix. This album just reminds that there is no God and that we are all going to die alone and sad as insignificant specs in a black sea of infinity. This album is the thing that should not be, yet it is, and that's why it caused me to go mad from the revelation. This album made me lose the will to live. This is St. Anger levels of bad. This is easily one of the top 5 worst albums I've ever heard. This thing was dated before it was even recorded, it was corny on impact, and the only positive I can heap on this thing is the fact that it was never released. That Celtic Frost had that one moment of sobriety where they said \"You know, this is shit. Let's not release it.\" I don't know what drugs they were on when recording this thing, but they must've been on something bad. Don't listen to this. Don't hurt yourself like that. Go listen to any of the other artists I mentioned above and you are guaranteed to like them more than this. Hell, Celtic Frost has a whole catalog of albums better than this. Go check those out if you are one of the two people who has never listened to Celtic Frost. As for me, let's just say that therapy is going to be very interesting today. 0/10\n",
        "\nReading some of the recent reviews, I get a little disappointed seeing that people think this album was a bad attempt on being a gothic/nu metal album because of its overall style. Celtic Frost have always tried out different styles and experimented alot with their sound, most of the time it worked very well and sometimes not. However, with \"Monotheist\", Celtic Frost definitely go back to their roots while still exploring new soundscapes and leaving the thrash metal almost completely behind. The main complaints for this album seem to direct the gothic sound as well as it's heavy & modern production, which I can understand if that's simply not your cup of tea. If you ask me though, this album is much more than that.\n\n\"Monotheist\" echoes an intense and gloomy, yet beautiful journey through an abyss that may or may not feel familiar. While it opens very loud & heavy, it will lead you through rather mellow and melodic parts as well, truly showing the mastermind behind CF. Even the two instrumental/ambient songs don't interrupt the constant atmosphere of doom at all, it harmonizes perfectly with the overall structure of the album, giving you an intense & creepy, yet beautiful journey through the deepest & darkest valleys. I never had the impression this album just wants to sound brutal and use that as a cheap method to impress the listeners. While it is that though, you can tell Tom Warrior & Martin Ain know better than that and its no surprise the album took about 5 years to make. You can feel the emotion put into the music in every song, whether it's Warrior's voice, smashing guitars or the creepy intro to 'Snyagoga Satanae', which leads me to the point that there is no filler moment on the album. The songs are very diverse, some very slow but intense, some very melodic with beautiful female vocals.\n\nI will admit that there is a certain amount of gothic influence apparent in some songs but it's not done in a pretentious way nor is it even close to being in the foreground, it's one of many styles used to create something authentic & original. The main focus is the oppressive doomy soundscape, which is why I would label \"Monotheist\" as a perfect mix of black, death & doom metal, creating a unique sound that results in an overall abyssal atmosphere that is extremely crushing, dark & full of sorrow but still very powerful. Mighty Celtic Frost proved for the last time that they are the true masters of extreme & dark music without needing to mindlessly thrash on their instruments.\n\nNot a typical black metal album but certainly a black tone to it. Just like this one, no CF album can be labeled to just one subgenre (excluding \"Cold Lake\"). Ever since \"To Mega Therion\", Celtic Frost have been avantgarde and experimented with their sound, using diverse styles and letting all kinds of influences flow into their music. Same with \"Monotheist\", while it mainly focuses on the gloomy, abyssal yet beautiful atmosphere. An absolute masterpiece & perfectly crafted piece of dark music, a must for anyone who has a heart for extreme metal.\n",
        "\nI'm not even sure how to start this review, like my head is reeling thinking of the process that lead Celtic Frost from helping spawn both death metal and black metal to this. Probably has something to do with Apollyon Sun but that's neither here nor there now. This would probably be amongst the most hated albums on the market if more people knew it as well as they know Roots or St. Anger and it's because like those two it has almost nothing in common with the band's original and monumental sound. In fact unlike the former two half this album barely stretches into the metal category and that's IF you consider bands like Rammstein and Korn to fit the bill.\n\nMusically about maybe half of it sounds to be somewhere between Rammstein and Static X but with more rapping. You have your synth and sound effects thrown in at every turn, slow downtuned guitars playing grooves but heavily shying away from leads and solos. The singing sounds very... dead, for lack of better description, he sounds like he's just going through the motions waiting for it to get over already and the other half of the time he's half aggressively rapping about something or other.\n\nThen the other half of the album doesn't even stay to that path. 'Hip Hop Jugend' discards all metal elements to focus on the synth and rapping to become a pure hip hop song. 'Get Wicked' is much the same but with an obvious and annoying Beastie Boys influence. Then there's 'Deep Inside', a poor attempt to imitate the Butthole Surfers while stealing the beat from Beck's 'Loser'. There's even a pure drum n' bass track. It spans a lot of outside influences and for that I'll give it some credit and even a decent amount of respect, but I don't think I'll ever be listening to a single one of these tracks again, much less the full thing.\n\nIf your a hip hop fan 'Hip Hop Jugend' is probably worthy of a 55% by itself and acts as the highlight for the album. Yes, the rap song is the highlight, its that weak on the metal side. Apart from that I'm dumping 30% on to it for being diverse.\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s been many a hilarious fuck-up throughout the course of human history. The Maginot Line, Tommy Wisseau\u2019s unintentional masterpiece The Room, Donald Trump's recent election, that time a few years ago when the French National Railway Company bought a bunch of trains that were too wide to fit in the stations they were supposed to serve. I wish I could say that the box of sonic sewage known as Celtic Frost\u2019s Prototype is the most baffling, absurd, and terrible of these but it's still among the most fascinating failures of all time. \n\nThis demo is like an onion the size of Yankee Stadium, so multitudinous are the layers of shittiness that make it up. You\u2019d think after Cold Lake, Tom Warrior would have learned his lesson about trying his hand at genres that are so far removed from what made Frost good in the first place. But no, with Prototype, we see Tom and company spitting a loogy in that lesson\u2019s face as they defile their own legacy. \n\nSo what genre is Celtic Frost butchering now? Or more accurately: what genre is butchering Celtic Frost? There's no neat, easy answer, but it could be described as a weird blend of rap, trip hop, nu metal, and experimental electronic music. No, that's not a typo or a joke. Get ready, people. This is gonna hurt. \n\nThe sheer number of ways to piss you off this album comes up with is impressive. Prototype gets off to an abysmal start with a cover of \u2018Helter Skelter,\u2019 where electronic beats that sound like a helicopter propeller lead the way instead of actual instruments while Tom switches between grunting and whispering the lyrics. This is easily the worst song on the album. It\u2019s less than five minutes long but you might need to take multiple breaks to get through it. Album closer \u2018Hip Hop Jugend\u2019 delivers an unendurable chorus where some lady lets loose a bunch supposedly sexy repetitions of \u201cooh baby\u201d while some assholes shout the song\u2019s title over and over in the background. Not only are both vocal lines horrid, but they don\u2019t even match up in any way that makes musical sense. And who the hell is that Star Wars alien yelling the verses? Is it Tom? Seriously, what the hell is going on here? \u2018Totgetanzt\u2019 is supposed to be a bit of atmosphere to break up the demo, I guess, with its sparse, endlessly thrumming beat and some rhythmic wheezing that\u2019s either being performed by Tom or a ghost that was haunting the studio. This is actually successful in cultivating some spookiness, as are some parts of the Beatles cover, which was intentionally twisted into something cold and sinister, but a few seconds after the song\u2019s atmosphere gets boring, a bunch of lazy EDM percussion livens things up in a way that banishes all the value this number has as a creepy mood-setter. \n\nThese are just the more notable examples of shitty songwriting in this album. Unfortunately, throughout Prototype's runtime, you'll constantly be assaulted by something annoying like weird, clumsy attempts at rapping (the worst example is found in \u2018Get Wicked (Dagger and Grail)\u2019, where the vocalist sounds like he\u2019s mentally handicapped, toothless, AND has peanut butter stuck to the roof of his mouth), weak hip hop drum beats, passages that can't seem to decide on whether they want to be ambient of industrial, and minimalistic electronic nonsense. As you listen, you'll probably beg for crappy mallcore riffing. Seriously. Tom's sparingly used guitar is only employed to belt out bottom-shelf nu metal riffs, but even these are so much better than the toxic sludge that makes up most of this album. They\u2019re the only thing on Prototype that even resembles metal, due to a complete lack of actual drumming. Pseudometal riffing, however banal, could have at least provided some sense of unity and tied the whole thing together if it appeared in every song and had any level of prominence. Instead, listeners are left to wander through a creepy serial killer maze of ideas born from the mangled carcasses of genres Frost has no business meddling with in the first place. \n\nPrototype seems to contradict itself. It appears to have been thrown together in an attempt at breaking into some commercial success. But if that's true, why is it so experimental, creepy, and atmospheric, usually in all the wrong ways? And why is it a demo, despite being long enough to be a full album? Did Frost change it to a demo at the last second because Tom and company realized it sucked? Did they intentionally throw it into obscurity because they didn't want it to trash their legacy? Did they end up releasing it in some form in the misguided hope that it would become revered as a triumph of innovation by the few who discovered it? Trying to puzzle Prototype out, attempting to grasp what it's supposed to be and why it exists, is such a fascinating thought experiment, it practically justifies the demo's existence. Like D.B. Cooper and Jack the Ripper, there's a smog of mystery surrounding Celtic Frost's greatest failure that honestly makes it worth digging into, though your ears will hate you for your effort.\n",
        "\nHaving picked on it's younger, uglier, stupider brother, I've decided that Morbid Tales slightly edges out over Emperor's Return, because it tries a little more and gets away with the act better too. It might help that the guitar tone on this one is not quite as sludgy as the other EP and that the songs break their concentration less regularly, yet I still have the same kind of problems with Tom G Warrior's death grunts, which are mostly amusing, not heavy.\n\nThe difficult thing for an EP is usually giving the songs a sense of cohesion and maintaining any kind of atmosphere throughout the release. Here, 'Human' (that's the name of the intro to 'Into the Crypts of Rays' on my version) does a very good job of sucking the listener in quickly with something quite unexpected but completely appropriate, those long distorted yells giving the impression of madness or torture, which compliments the lyrics about Gilles de Rais that follow. Then there are the grim bends that are put into lots of the slow riffs - for example at the beginning of 'Procreation (of the Wicked)' - which mean that the doomy passages aren't too plain and also contain something slightly unexpected. 'Danse Macabre' was probably conceived with the same sort of intention as 'Human', but it feels forced and is too long, stretching a few creepy ideas out to absurd lengths. Plus, anyone claiming for Celtic Frost's cool cult status should really listen again to Warrior doing the \"la la la la\" bits in 'Danse Macabre'.\n\nHowever, the most part of this EP is made up of mid-paced dirty metal riffs that sound a bit like Motorhead morphing into a NWOBHM group and then continuing past the point of Angel Witch and Saxon without even looking back, spicing things up with a bit of thrash as they get bored. It's a soup of styles and has a distinct primordial flavour, which is one reason why it tastes a bit off, even if those given a ladelful have taken an immense influence from the Swiss group. The riffs are great on 'Nocturnal Fear' and 'Into the Crypts of Rays', with a much more buoyancy than that sludgy sound on Emperor's Return, as well as a slightly more upbeat pace. Guitar, drums, and bass are all busy, mostly playing riffs and cooperating for some surprisingly slick changes of pace, though there are only a couple of guitar solos. Warrior blurs a lot of his vocals and mispronounces a few words, though since he isn't snarling that heavily it might be for the best, otherwise he would sound too nice for the dirty guitar tone. The death grunts still seem to me like Warrior stubbing his toe in the recording studio, even if he gets one right at the end of 'Nocturnal Fear' - but whatever.\n\nAll in all, Morbid Tales is a decidedly important EP along with its successor, though not hugely enjoyable to listen to all that often. This one sounds more fun and lively than most other Celtic Frost releases, so it gets modest rotation. In 2016, half a thumb up from me.\n",
        "\nWell, think again. Celtic Frost are one of those bands that everyone seems to pay homage to or love in a totally slavish way and despite giving the Swiss gents the benefit of the doubt for 7 years (I bought this EP and Morbid Tales a looooong time ago), I've never been able to understand either of those views.\n\nOk, so I exaggerate slightly about not being able to understand why Celtic Frost are important, but Venom went down the extreme path a good few years before, while Bathory had an album out by 1984 that treads a lot of the same circles as early Frost releases. All that aside, this is really not something I would choose to listen to beyond mere curiosity or musical scholarship. I have never once said to myself \"I feel like listening to Celtic Frost right now\" and there's good reason too. In the first place, I'm not a big fan of the way they play metal. Sure, there are elements of thrash, speed, and nascent extreme metal, but that guitar tone is pure swill, too low and gritty to make the faster riffs sound sharp and exciting, while the slower parts would work if they had atmosphere or direction to them - which, however, they don't. For a doom/sludge album, maybe, but not for this. Then, there are Tom G Warrior's \"revolutionary\" vocals, which are so frayed and ugly he sounds like he's drunk too much at the pub and is talking to himself as he wanders home, occasionally bumping into things and letting out a sudden exclamation (that's the death grunts if you were wondering).\n\nSometimes it works, like on the clearly impressive verses of 'Circle of the Tyrants', but then the sound of that guitar as it shifts chords - usually straight up or straight down in an infuriatingly obvious way - spoils the enjoyment of other parts, plus the fact that a lot of transitions seem to happen at random. The lurching, abrupt nature of a lot of the riffs and introductions really gets on my nerves, particularly some of the speed metal riffs that are just there, while the slower chugging riffs are sometimes alright, although the bass is pretty annoying during the one from 'Morbid Tales'. The solos are fairly impressive, usually shredding through quickly and unexpectedly, but again they emerge from absolutely nowhere and their reason for inclusion seems to be \"because we can\", not for any real purpose. Considering all that, you would think I had some issues with the drumming too; however, hats off to Reed St Mark because his performance is genuinely great to listen to, playing with a good feel for the dual pace of the band and never stepping on anyone's toes.\n\nDespite the fact that I've mostly been shitting on Emperor's Return, I should point out that it has some worth, especially if you're immune to the ridiculousness of Warrior's voice and the misused guitar tone. There's atmosphere at times, which that sludgy tone can provide when it's bent into darker shapes, while some of the faster riffs are pretty exciting, if some one accepts that some are predictable too. My favourite and most despised parts of this release both come on the same song, since the latter part of 'Dethroned Emperor' has a nice lick added to the chugging riff and a great death doom section, though nothing can redress the sins of Warrior mutilating the title with horrible stress, so that it becomes \"dethRONEd emPEror\". That and the arduous opening riff are rubbish, while I'm only inclined to say the rest of the EP is alright, not great.\n",
        "\nGetting all my impressions of what the metal scene of today is into from this site and its reviews and forums, there seems to be a really grating trend in the last few years of putting the entire emphasis of appreciation for recent metal releases on production and aesthetics with very little attention paid to what is actually played. I don't know whether it is correlation or causation, but I see the worst examples in the \"revival\" of old school death metal, where bands like Encoffination can play two-note drones with zero musical content but be likened to the ungodly Incantation based on aesthetics alone, or where lazy fiddlings of random notes drenched in reverb like Chth'whatever are compared to the legendary Demilich without a batting of the eye. But really, I feel the starting point of this disturbing trend to be Celtic Frost's re-imagining of their dreadful Prototype-demo style by simply slowing down the kind of dreck they played on the demo and giving it a huge production and making it all sad and goth and whatever.\n\nI'm really reminded by what a fellow reviewer of the old days once wrote about that new Neurosis album, how they are still playing those huge chords with all the gravity they always had, that crushing weight they exuded with each stroke of the guitar and that suffocating effect of how every monolithic chord slowly rung out, but that that's actually all they were doing anymore, just playing huge, crushing chords, but not playing anything with them. Like getting their entire substance just from playing each chord, but nothing, zero, nada from anything the combination of chords did together. Monotheist is like that. It's huge, crushing chords. The production on this album, the tone of the guitar, it is really fucking huge, and crushing as hell, and each individual chord does sound massive. But never, not at a single point on this album, do these chords ever do anything together, let alone ever form a riff, let alone ever even get within a line of sight (not even if you had the aid of the Hubble) of the riffs you hear on the EPs or debut album. Whatever riffs you want to imagine on Monotheist, it's really the kind of shit they tried on Prototype to dream of baiting Korn and System of a Down fans into the morbid fold. That demo was shelved because it was as pathetic and obvious a \"we follow every trend\"-circus as Cold Lake, but the idea survived, it was simply reshaped to appear \"more Celtic Frost\" by changing the aesthetics. Same pitiful style of non-riffs, but re-imagined slower and sadder so the jumpdafuckup won't jump da fuck in your face as much, given a monolithic sound that courts similarities to the legendary Apocalyptic Raids EP and whoosh everyone is happy. You couldn't do the same with a Papa Roach album, because while musically it would be the same if treated to the same aesthetic change, Monotheist succeeds entirely on brand recognition. So the mind of the listener goes from \"Oh this is a gothed up nu-metal album\" to \"Oh Celtic Frost are back with this dark and crushing sound.\" No, they're not back in any way and you've been tricked by clever marketing.\n\nThat to this day this album continues to be confused for metal is mind-boggling in one way, because pretty much every song on here would fit on any Korn/Marilyn Manson collaboration album, but on the other hand it is not surprising at all if I think back of the obsession with production and aesthetics I bemoaned in the opening of this review. If Encoffination sounds like Onward to Golgotha then surely Monotheist is as balls to the wall extreme fucking metal as Morbid Tales, if not more so - the guitars sound heavier after all. Moving past the surface however, there's no way around everything on the album being a mix between nu-metal and modern gothic rock. If you try to recreate the sound of Love Like Blood's (German gothic rock band) Snakekiller album (produced by Peter T\u00e4gtgren), and started mixing Roots non-riffs with it at half to two-thirds their speed, you'd have Monotheist in a nutshell. In essence, it's Prototype V2.0, and by extension Cold Lake V3.0, and further proof that no low is low enough for Tom to never stoop to. I am glad that internal band differences put a halt to the mission to conquer MTV and Hot Topic and that Tom at least can't misuse the brand recognition for his quest for a gold plated and diamond encrusted Ferrari and sully the name of one of heavy metal's most iconic legends in the process. And people of the metal world, come to your senses and train your ears to listen for riffs again before letting yourself be fooled by production values and aesthetics. As long as the majority of reviews on this site discuss guitar tones and mastering techniques for 90% of their content and make only passing side-mentions - if any - of what the instruments actually play, I cannot rediscover my faith in our once glorious community to see through this dethroned emperor's lack of clothes, and the empowering of all production/aesthetics-supported fakes riding the wave of being able to claim fame without content by fiddling with the right gears in the studio and polishing it up with the right window dressing. May the false be without entry!\n",
        "\nI can't really understand why this demo ever came to exist. Celtic Frost have jumped on dodgy trends before with Cold Lake going full on glam metal, but this still confuses me even more. Tom Warrior had Apollyon Sun for industrial and \"alternative\" tinged metal that came very close to, but never really graced nu metal. This would've really fit better into that catalog rather than leaving a disgusting poop stain on the Celtic Frost discography. They are so embarrassed about this thing existing that they don't even mention it on their website while the compilation I'm Parched With Thirst And I Am Dying gets a spot instead. This is something that frankly shouldn't exist, but it does. Now I guess you're going to ask me for reasons as to why I gave this such a low rating? Well here goes nothing.\n\nThe musical styling of this album just makes no sense at all. A principally industrial nu metal release? this is not Celtic Frost material at all, this is not you, this feels and sounds so forced and trendy that I can't fathom this ever working. The genre change is hokier than the Virginia Tech gift shop and it never comes off as though the boys in Celtic Frost ever really wanted to do this. Changing genres can be fine, but at least be genuine and passionate instead of just doing it to make bank as was clearly the case here. The reason this is treated as a demo and not a full album stems from some odd feeling as though Tom Warrior and Martin Ain knew this was going to be shit, and preemptively stopped this from receiving label backing and a full release before they could embarrass themselves with a Cold Lake for the 21st century. A bullet dodged indeed as most people who know Celtic Frost choose to ignore this, and it still remains mostly ignored even to this day, long after Celtic Frost has decided to permanently disband.\n\nThe musical aspects of this album as an individual album rather than as a genre example are where most of the damage is done anyways. Most of the songs are electronically driven and feature little guitars, if any, so to call this metal isn't even really fair unless you count every metal connected electro-industrial or EBM act as a metal band. There are some metal songs like Beautiful End, but even then that makes up a minority of tracks on this album, and it's usually nu metal that even other nu metal bands would laugh at. Where guitars show up, they're either just \"nu-metal riff 101\" riffs, or they serve as weedly background effects that contribute nothing to the song. The electronic elements featured here are as simple as they get and it's often one boring loop played over and over again for 5 minutes. Some songs even feature Tom Warrior singing in a style I like to call \"perv breath\" in which he breathes so heavy and hard that he sounds like a horny old man coming up behind you to grope you. The all-techno Helter Skelter cover (which also features a lot of wheeze-singing) and Totzgetanzt (where the vocals are JUST heavy pervert breathing) are the worst offenders. When he actually does decide to sing, he sounds like the big-tongued, drunken, down syndrome-addled uncle of Jonathan Davis, sounding really ugly and silly any time he decides to give the nu metal singing style a whack at it. Some songs just make no sense at all. Get Wicked (Dagger And Grail) is some weird rap number done by what sounds like a juggalo rapping in some language that just sounds like gibberish in his nasally Pee Wee Herman voice like he has his tongue hanging out. He even has the balls to throw a shout-out reference to Procreation Of The Wicked at the end of that dumb experiment, a song that Dagger And Grail will never match up to. The other weird experiment that made no sense was Hip Hop Jugend which features some generic euro-techno shouting beat while some woman says \"ooh baby, ooh baby\" over and over again while Tom croaks out a rap number in German in a voice that sounds like a bad Dracula impersonation. MAKE IT STOP! There's nothing good about this musically, in any way, shape, or form.\n\nFrankly, I'm glad that this entire endeavor stayed on the cutting room floor. The world didn't need any more bad electro-nu metal in 2002 and they certainly didn't need it from a band that we know could do better things with thrash and black metal. This didn't go anywhere nor did it need to, it has no reason to exist, other than as a simple, horrid curiosity. Get Wicked was funny, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this. If you want to listen for curiosity's sake or for a laugh, go ahead. But, I'm warning you, this is stupidity distilled into it's purest form. This demo has no business being a thing in this world.\n",
        "\nThe second best songs of Sabaton are those which have never been released. The best songs of Sabaton are those which have never been written. The songs of Celtic Frost's \"Cold Lake\" are even better than the best songs of the aforementioned velvet battalion of commercially oriented \"metal\". Congratulations from my side. Nevertheless, they are anything else but good.\n\nThe biggest disadvantage of the album is not the music itself, although the majority of the compositions is truly mediocre or even bad. Shit happens. What really annoys me is the fact that Celtic Frost sacrificed their reputation without any cause whatever. Did they really think they will start a rock star career when opening their zippers and releasing simple, mid-paced, fairly powerless songs? If this was the case, I am dismayed. How can people be so naive?\n\nOne of the worst and most stupid intros in the history of mankind opens the album. Funny guys at work! Even \"Cold Lake\" does not deserve such an intro, because some songs have a relatively dark aura, not least because of the slightly dull sound. Too bad that the first regular track does not belong to these tracks. The band made no secret of its desire to enter the charts. All former ideals had been jettisoned. What a shame. Honestly, to listen to Thomas Gabriel (formerly known under a different name, if I am not mistaken) how he is begging \"Seduce Me Tonight\" - this is no nice experience. Fortunately, a few songs of \"Cold Lake\" have a higher potential. \"Juices Like Wine\" suffers from a faceless chorus, but its main riff shines with a certain currishness and, among other things, the well accentuated double bass is responsible for some more or less dramatic tempo intensifications. The less aggressive \"Cherry Orchards\" contains an effective, desperate chorus. Its atmosphere fits the sub title of the track (\"Roses for an Unborn Face\") in a very good manner. \"Downtown Hanoi\" has comparable vibes due to its dark aura. But it would be a lie to say that one can find elements of the \"true Celtic Frost\" in these songs.\n\nAnyway, songs like \"Little Velvet\" or \"Blood on Kisses\" are absolutely meaningless, ill-defined and lame. Needless to say that the slimy \"Petty Obsession\" also falls by the wayside. All these pieces are prone to sleepy riffs and anaemic lines, but they are crowned by the ridiculous style of Mr. Gabriel, who tries to offer new facets. Okay, this is a very polite description. Frankly speaking, he adds insult to injury. Whenever he intends to sound seductive, his unnatural behaviour makes me sick, but the riffs, the chorus and any other details are terrible as well. Not to mention the icky band photos. For example, the picture of Curt Victor Bryant on the inner sleeve revealed that he was not able to cross the street without foreign aid. Due to his embarrassing hair styling, he was actually blind. Anyway, all band members looked like clowns of the cheapest circus in town. \"Dance Sleazy\"? Take your last breath would also be a good idea.\n\nNow what has this got to do with a piss band like Sabaton? Admittedly, not much. But guys who release moronic albums like \"Cold Lake\" deserve to be associated with the most senseless formations of the universe. Our egocentric friend Joey DeMaio also wants to be mentioned in this context? So be it.\n",
        "\nThank God that Celtic Frost haven't released this as an official full-length, because if they did that, Cold Lake wouldn't have been considered as their worst release. We all know that Cold Lake was really bad, so could it get any worse from there?\n\nIt did with this demo.\n\nThis ain't no occult proto-BM like the band used to play, or the gothic doom of Monotheist. . I don't know what drugs the band took at the time of the recording of this horrendous slab of scum, but it caused them to hallucinate, and making them listen to a lot of Laibach (hence the experimental nature of the album) and Korn, which apparently made them think like they can rap like they came straight outta the hood. BUT THEY FUCKING DIDN'T. This is their worst attempt in producing any type of music, and even the most low-graded nu metal bands are better by far than this pile of crap. \n\nThis is an ultra low class rap/hip hop album with some occasional good moments, which is why the given score here is 13% and not 0%. The rarely used riffs are decent, and it's a pity that they weren't used in more worthy places/ a Korn album. They can relate to very low-notch nu metal more than they do to any previous output of the band, which is obviously a major degrade in sound. All (but two) of the songs here are nothing less than abortive and migraine-triggering, with lacking any sense of musicianship or creativity. Tom sounds here like a weaker Jonathan Davis, who raps very bad,has nauseating cleans, and lacks any motivation or power- which is one of the demo's major downfalls. The drums don't help the situation either, with occasionally saving the day by the help of some below average beats which provide some of the demo's high points. \n\nThere are exactly two worthy songs in here: The Dying I and Human Dirt, which could've been cut down by a bit (especially the latter) that would've made them pretty decent. The rest of the songs here are pure shit, with showing how bad Tom and co. \"can\" make decent experimental music. There are even two cover songs which were defiled in that way- The Beatles' Helter Skelter that was turned into an appalling techno abortion, and their very own Danse Macabre which was once one of the most evil intros ever used in metal, but was treated in the same way and made really bad.\n\nListen to this if you like shitty experimental music, or if you're a masochist, because it will make you suffer. Avoid.\n",
        "\nIn a genre where profanity and lyrics about violence is rather common, there are still some unmentionable things which offend the metal legions. Celtic Frost's Cold Lake is one of these unmentionables. It is regarded as one of metal's worst abominations, sharing a place in a pantheon of rubbish alongside such luminaries as Lulu, Load, Risk, Illud Divinum Insanus and The Unspoken King.\n\nBut what happens if we strip away Celtic Frost's earlier and later endeavours and legacy and view Cold Lake on its own? Firstly, contrary to popular belief, the music is not glam metal. This album doesn't have much to do with the likes of Ratt, Poison or even the heavier moments of Twisted Sister or M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Instead, the music is mid-paced dirty thrash tinged heavy metal with punky vocals. The production is still quite crusty and there is certainly no polished glam metal sheen here. But to be fair, some of the lyrics are on the glam metal side of things. In some ways the albums sounds too old for 1988 since the riff structure and overall sound harkens more to early 1980s NWOBHM. \n\nBut then the question arises: is it good? And the answer is: for the most part it's not too bad. In fact, bits of it are quite good for 1980s heavy metal.\n\nFor example, \"(Once) They Were Eagles\" has a nice driving riff, a catchy chorus and a great little solo. Also \"Cherry Orchards\", which has a massive riff, some nice fat bass and some appropriately slutty female vocals. Even \"Dance Sleazy\" is a bit of fun with lots of archetypal chug riffs. There are many other cool moments too if you like the 1980's riffs. Some elements could have been better; the intro for example is downright irritating. And Tom Warrior's slightly raspy clean vocals aren't the greatest, but then again, they never have been. At times they grate, but they have done so on other releases before. The lyrics are dismal for the most part.\n\nSome songs are quite poor; \"Blood On Kisses\" sounds like a meager version of some of Anvil's mediocre modern moments, but is generally inoffensive enough to allow continued listening. But even though the album does run out of steam closer to the end, Cold Lake is far more consistent than the schizophrenic, and in my opinion seriously flawed, Into The Pandemonium. The at times strained clean vocals and lame lyrics aren't that far removed from what Celtic Frost had done in the past either.\n\nDon't listen to the album if you want proto-black or avantgarde metal. Certainly don't listen to if you have expectations of what Celtic Frost is meant to sound like. Listen to it if you want a sleazy, gritty and thrashy heavy metal album with some cool riffs.\n",
        "\nMonotheist is the reigning monarch of wasted sound waves. The same band that delivered classics like \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d and \u201cTo Mega Therion\u201d has returned with an effort, devoid of meaningful inspiration, and brimming with ill-conceived notions of experimental virtue. For those of us who possess a solid musical memory, this album is a curse. Amnesia would be a welcome release from the trauma inflicted by subjecting our ears to Celtic Frost\u2019s \u201ccomeback.\u201d\n\nThe first thing that becomes apparent, is Celtic Frost\u2019s drastically altered delivery. All of the band\u2019s former punch is lost. Monotheist sounds like \u201cTo Mega Therion\u201d with brain damage. The drums; though well produced, are performed in an uninspired, drum machine fashion. Fuzzy guitar rifts are not only simplistic and amateurish, but also a thousand times less heavy than the band, circa 1985. Gone are the days of demolishing monsters like \u201cThe Usurper:\u201d enter an era of cavernous gash and effeminate expression. \n\nAgonizing riffs are bad enough at denying further inclination to continue listening; but when they never relent, they become scourges of joviality. Celtic Frost never broke new ground in song progression, but Monotheist repeats itself to the point of regurgitation. \u201cProgeny\u201d is sufficient to stir positive emotion in the beginning, only to die a slow death by insidious restatement of the same riff. Ambient noise and half-baked intros poison the album even further. \u201cWinter\u201d is the only track that is worth listening to from beginning to end, and it happens to be an instrumental. \n\nTom Warrior\u2019s voice used to be an effective display of character and aggression. The days of guttural indignation are long gone; however, and the vocals sound emaciated. Warrior even lowered himself to the point of simply talking on \u201cDrown in Ashes.\u201d Ironically, the song \u201cDomain of Decay\u201d is the perfect, symbolic title of Frost\u2019s current state.\n\nMonotheist is an album worthy of being ignored. Instead, appreciate the band for their former glory by listening to their early to mid 80s offerings.\n",
        "\nAllow me to come straight to the point, \"To Mega Therion\" is the best album of Celtic Frost. Whoever claims otherwise is either a questionable creature or badly informed. Okay, I don't want to be intolerant. But in my opinion, the Swiss legend never released a more fascinating full-length. Here comes my line of argument. \"To Mega Therion\" is better than...\n\n...\"Into the Pandemonium\", because the here presented album was highly innovative. Its successor was just the lukewarm afterburner. The gatefold cover, the artworks by H. R. Giger, the carefully thought out instrumentation with blowers and timpani, the exceptional female vocals in \"Necromantical Screams\" and stimulating song titles like \"Dawn of Megiddo\" made clear that Celtic Frost were attacking on all fronts. By contrast, \"Into the Pandemonium\" was riding in the slipstream of its overpowering predecessor while offering partly lame songs. Just one example. Album openers should be more or less representatives of the respective full-length. Now feel free to compare the sinister, fast-paced \"The Usurper\" with the ridiculous cover version that kicked off \"Into the Pandemonium\". No doubt, \"To Mega Therion\" wins the competition. However, returning to innovation, Celtic Frost did not make the mistake to put emphasis on their avant-garde approach. They just were innovative - and their discreet form of understatement showed their mature personalities.\n\n...\"Cold Lake\". This needs no explanation.\n\n...\"Vanity / Nemesis\", because \"To Mega Therion\" presents the stronger songs. Especially the tracks of the B side blow the listener's mind, naturally with the exception of the extravagant yet incomprehensible and slightly imbecile sound collage \"Tears in a Prophet's Dream\". But \"Circle of the Tyrants\" and the pumping \"Fainted Eyes\" are aggressive, pitch-black and shock with apocalyptic sounds that are based on pure heaviness. \"(Beyond the) North Winds\" needs some time to reveal its full potential, but don't underrate this stoically marching mid-tempo piece. In particular the ghostlike guitars during the up-tempo part after the second chorus left its special scent. The gigantic closer \"Necromantical Screams\" picks up the pompous approach of some tracks of the A side (\"Innocence and Wrath\" and \"Dawn of Megiddo\") without neglecting blackness, morbidity and heaviness. Generally speaking, the song material is outstanding. It thrives on darkness and creepiness, but it also offers an admirable degree of pioneering spirit. The entire album seems to be based on pure dedication and the will to create something new. 30 years after its release, this special flair is still present.\n\n...\"Monotheist\", because this album of the 21st century has a different vibe that does not really meet my image of Celtic Frost. Born in another time, it cannot bring back the specific spirit of the early works of the band. Apart from that, \"To Mega Therion\" scores with a better production, at least from my subjective standpoint. The album is heavy and has its individual charm, although the guitar appears slightly awkward. It almost seems as if the guitar sound is the last relic of the old Hellhammer days. Contrariwise, the drums and the further instruments make a well defined contribution. Not to mention the vocals of Tom Warrior. He does not belong to the most virtuoso metal vocalists, but each and every word that he sings proves his charisma. Moreover, his demonic singing style fits very well with the sinister guitars and the intelligent lyrics are also noteworthy. These details aside, the album has its own character and creates a very exciting overall impression. Contrastingly, \"Monotheist\" is just noisy.\n\nHopefully, I have been successful in convincing you of the remarkable quality of this classic from 1985. If not, you should lend an ear to highlights such as \"Fainted Eyes\" or \"Necromantical Screams\". These songs deliver the best arguments. Anyway, the album deserves your attention. It has lost none of its importance since its publication. Sad but true, the vast majority of the current clowns that maltreat our ear canals will never reach the brilliance of \"To Mega Therion\". Ugh!\n",
        "\nThe metal media at the time of the mid 1980s were about as intelligent as Courtney Love in a judicial setting. As far as they were concerned, a formula was set. Anyone outside the realms of either Yngwie level virtuosity or Warrant level marketability were trashed to the side of a maelstrom of overpopulation in a metal scene that was two steps away from being totally catatonic. What laid in the way of upcoming and innovative metal bands, was a level of closed mindedness thicker than the layers of fat on the managers denouncing them.\n\nI think I need to set up a few prerequisites. I'm not reviewing the Hellhammer stuff, FOR NOW. If I'm gonna review the Hellhammer releases, it will be at a later time in a more set black metal series. I want to focus strictly on the Celtic Frost/Triptykon works for the time being. I feel that this will leave room for me to include Hellhammer in a series that I could dedicate to first and second wave black metal releases. Also, one more thing. I'm going to also review the \"Emperor's Return\" EP in this review too. For two reasons. One, to make this more like an album review and less like a simple EP. And two, because my re release of Morbid Tales came with the other EP.\n\nCeltic Frost however, now that's a group of youngsters who bow to no label. The placement of Celtic Frost in the time period they were in was quite unfortunate. Hellhammer themselves were denounced and shredded by holier-than-thou record producers and promoters, who saw the band as nothing more than a poor excuse of a Venom clone. They gave Hellhammer even LESS credit than they gave to Venom, who at the time, were already seen as an emaciated punk band trying to play heavy metal. Tom and Martin, seeing this as a bad omen, decided to restart. Taking a year to hone their craft and form their style, they came back in 1984 with a dirty dungeon of disastrous dissonance. And that's the best landscape to view this album as, a dungeon. It's full of hidden paths and dark corridors, some which you might even miss your first time through. Before this, metal seemed to be laid out very blatantly to the listener. For as heavy and noisy and Sabbath and Purple were, you could understand exactly what kind of riffs they were presenting (usually) the first time around. Celtic Frost's appreciation for the then sprouting gothic rock and death rock scenes brought a whole new layer of musical complexity. Where they lacked technicality, the gained in creating a mental picture of their music.\n\nOne influence people like to forget about Celtic Frost, is the hardcore. The very first track (after a chilling intro) \"Into The Crypt Of Rays\" holds a strong influence from British D-beat stranglehold band Discharge. But with this layer of metallic riffing that overpowers the mix and crushes out the high end. There's this wobbly and dissonant flow to these riffs. Even at the mid point, where the entire song slows to a doom metal style dirge. These are some of the most well positioned tempo changes I've heard in metal. Switching between this simple punk aggression to this sabbathian groove. I think this track (along with the Emperor's Return material) shows off Tom's vocals the best. The one way to describe them would be a \"proto death growl\". They have that same grit and dirt of Lemmy's voice mixed with the howling bark of Cronos. They speak like a crusty and black oracle of ancient lore. They throw the normal first wave black metal cheesiness out the window. And instead pull favors from the more grotesque and throaty vocals that Tom's accent nearly forces.\n\nThis fact is not only emphasized, but exemplified by my favorite track from this EP, \"Procreation of the Wicked\". The slow, sludgy, and disconnected riff, placed so firmly between the grip of the rhythm section's steel grasp, makes for a twisted and warped experience. It steamrolls nearly every other track on \"Morbid Tales\", maybe minus the title track. It was a perfect overture to a career by a band who would go on to exemplify \"avant-garde metal\".\n\nThis EP mixes pallet with push. The experimentation of the intro track \"Human\" and the pseudo-industrial \"Danse Macabre\". mixed with the somewhat more accessible tracks like \"Morbid Tales\" make this a great extreme metal gateway record. The more prevalent bass production and some of the earliest use of d-beats in metal, makes this record not only fantastic, but also innovative. But these few tracks are only a fraction of how fantastic the next EP was destined to be.\n\nEmperor's Return, now we're cooking with crisco. Almost a concept record of sorts, it was the band truly finding their tone. Across it's 4 original tacks (and 1 re-recording) you will see what Frost was truly becoming. It opens with what could be the most recognizable track In CF history, Circle Of The Tyrants. From it's minor-toned dissonant opening riff, to it's thrashy verse riffs, the song was attacking from all sides and angles. Tom's signature \"UH!\" giving it a sprinkle of flavor. And just when you think it's monotonous thrashing throughout, it hits you with a sticky and crushing main riff that will carry the song to the back of your subconscious for the next few weeks. Not to mention the near-plagiarism of Diamond Head in the opening riff of \"Dethroned Emperor\" (which would weirdly be plagiarized AGAIN on the first Napalm Death LP). But if you ask me, it whips Diamond Head's riff left right and front-center. It's fuzzy, busting, and full of bloody surprises. Not to mention Tom pretty much gaining a full on death metal growl on this track. This EP is far more leaning on the low-fi edge of the spectrum. While nothing is muddy, it's hazy and misty. But much like the bands lyrics, it works in the favor of building a stronger foundation for the music. \n\nYou'll find that much like the band's debut LP \"To Mega Therion\" the tracks on Emperor's Return are well formed and innovative to nearly every genre of extreme metal. From it's thrashy chugging, to the low-fi black metal styled crackling, to Tom's blatant death metal styled growl, this entire record is filled with stylized and bludgeoning tracks that will leave you begging for more.\n\nIn conclusion, both EP's are essential to any lover of extreme metal. But If I had to choose the superior, I'm going to go with the opus of \"Emperors Return\" for both it's fantastic songwriting and crushing heaviness.\n\nFINAL RATING:\n\nMorbid Tales: 8/10\n\nEmperor's Return: 9/10\n",
        "\nI wish I could say that my favorite album of all time was less\u2026 dark. After all, I\u2019m a lot more cheery these days than the anti-social teenager I was when I first discovered Celtic Frost, and extreme metal as a whole. But the Frost\u2019s final album, Monotheist, still manages to move me the way no other music can. Needless to say, it\u2019s not moving in a somber or relaxing way, but it is moving in an engaging and exciting way. It is not superficially exciting in a way that tries to impress and repeat, because there are no flashy mechanics at work here. Every moment is filled with aggression, sorrow, or contempt. Every second a note rings, it is filled with such loudness and intensity that the anger and pain the artists felt is transmitted quiver for quiver into your nervous system. I mean every second. This is thanks to the piercing guitar tone, which is amazingly harsh but certainly distinct from the rumbling base. Tom\u2019s sonic cannon of a guitar produces a dearth of boring riffs, which are distinct from the rumbling growls of Martin\u2019s bass. All of this is accompanied by Sesa\u2019s abundance of rhythmic variations, as well as carefully selected studio touches. The lyrics depict our deepest fears of the unknown, and foulest contempt for that which we do know very well. In every angle from which you can assess a piece of music, Monotheist appears to be flawless.\n\nBut most importantly, Monotheist will successfully transform your state of mind. Like any good art should, this album is capable of altering your emotions. Again, the more cheery me enjoys feeling other things, and most of the time I may be better off feeling the sobering jubilance of Neil Young, fiery arousal of Queens of the Stone Age, or introspective honesty of Todd Rundgren. But while those other artists offer most desirable emotions to connect to with their music, they do not do so with the consistency that Celtic Frost does. Monotheist, along with most music from this band, has the capability of turning you into a warrior almost instantly. You will immediately feel pummeled by the worlds obstacles thanks to the authenticity of Celtic Frost\u2019s connection to darkness. Monotheist will forever be able to turn me into a fighting, angry, beaten victim and a metalhead at the drop of a hat, and for that reason I can confidently assign a rating of 100% to this album.\n",
        "\nDreary, gloomy, doom. That about sums it up. This album is not a cry for help; it is genuinely going to kill itself. Slow, trudging distorted guitar chords, lots of grimy chug, flawless double bass. The production is done so well it\u2019s like sitting in a dark cave listening to the band live. There are some faster moments with the more thrash-based Domain of Decay and Ain Alohim. But honestly my favorite tracks are the bleak, measured plodders. The first 6 tracks are the best, but never would I stop this play before the final curtain.\n\nThe key here is contrast. There is a duality of the gritty and grimy with the beautiful. Drown in Ashes is the clearest example. The beautiful female vocals contrast perfectly with Tom\u2019s theatrical, grim, ugliness.\n\nBut it is the lyrics and delivery that truly sell the whole thing. There are some clear anthems here: \u201cOS! A-bys-mi, OS!\u201d which translates to \u201cOnly Death is Real.\u201d Or \u201cTET-RA-gramm-a-ton!\u201d one of the names for the national god of Israel. There is some great imagery as well: \u201cFrozen is heaven and frozen is hell. And I am dying in this living human shell.\u201d \u201cAnd I think that I'm all alone. I can feel the rain pull me down again.\u201d It should all come off as a bunch of cheesy, gothic prose, but damned if Tom G Warrior doesn\u2019t sell the shit out of it. There is a genuine sense of longing, loneliness, and hopelessness. As someone who works with people who suffer from clinical depression, these vocals are the closest representation I have seen of the internalized cognitive patterns at play. The lyrics are supposedly influenced by the writings of Aleister Crowley.\n\nThere is also some successful but sparing use of industrial elements. These are most apparent on some of the earlier tracks and the last three with very ambient keyboards. Speaking of the last three tracks, they are the most experimental. They form a three-part suite that forms a pretty decent segue into the directions taken on with Triptykon. There is less traditional structure and the songs seem to meander aimlessly with various sounds, voices, guitar feedback, etc. It\u2019s not something I would recommend listening to in isolation, but rather a thematic closing of the album. It\u2019s as if Tom has transitioned from depression into complete despair and is lost in his own personal hell. Things do pick up again a few minutes into part two, with a return to the anthemic, dark vocals being spat more than sung: \u201cIn DARKness\u2026Thou. Shall. Wor-ship ME!\u201d There is so much venom it is palpable. Then we close with the most lovely of string arrangements.\n\nIn the end, I find this far more accessible than Celtic Frost\u2019s bygone 80\u2019s thrash era and the endless tracks of Triptykon. Song length is generally reasonable averaging about 5 minutes. But don\u2019t get me wrong. If you like this, you definitely have to try Melana Chasmata. Your increased patience will be rewarded.\n",
        "\nI really want to give this a higher rating. I truly do. And by all accounts, I should. There\u2019s no denying this album\u2019s status and influence on the extreme metal and avant-garde genres. And, for the most part, it\u2019s easy to see why; it's got some amazing riffs, tight playing, and great experimentation with instruments and song composition. But there is one fatal flaw that almost ruins the album for me, the only experiment on this album that fails miserably: Tom G. Warrior's vocals. Let me set the stage for you a little bit: It's a couple years ago, and I've been a Frost fan for quite a while. I've played my copies of Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion more than a few times. It's at this point that I decide to sample one of the band's more famously eclectic albums in their catalogue, Into The Pandemonium. \n\nThe first track, \"Mexican Radio,\" starts up, and I'm instantly impressed. Even though it's a cover, Celtic Frost make it all their own, thrashing it up and throwing in a few random instrumentations (i.e. \"more cowbell\") for extra flavour. I knew this album had a reputation for being experimental, so these little nuances weren't the least bit surprising. In fact, I though it was a welcome addition to the bands sound; a natural evolution from the subtle symphonic/operatic touches of their previous albums. The band members themselves sound in top form. Tom Warrior's trademark guitar tone cuts razor sharp through the mix; his classic grunting vocal style is on display in full glory, replete with as many \"OOH\"s, \"AAH\"s and \"HEY\"s as any fan could hope for. \n\nSo once that groovy little number is done, we get into the next track, \"Mesmerized,\" and again I'm instantly impressed. It starts out with a nice, doom-laden groove, quickly transitions into an almost funk-like section, and then...Tom opens his mouth.\n\nWhen I heard him sing the first few lyrics, I froze. Any semblance of groove my body was experiencing, foot tapping, head-bobbing, anything at all, instantly ceased. What the fuck did I just hear? It sounded like some whiny, nasally cartoonishly over-the-top vampire! I tried to shake it off, but alas, the song continued...and so did Tom's \"singing.\" As it turns out, on this track and several others on the album, he decided to \"experiment\" with a new vocal style. And by that, I mean he sounds like Bane slitting his wrists and reading emo poetry through his mask. \n\nSeriously, this vocal choice was so out of fucking left-field that I burst out laughing. I was LAUGHING at Celtic Frost! Not since gazing upon the unspeakable horrors of the \"Cherry Orchards\" video had I felt such shame, such guilt for a band I admire. And I usually love unique vocal styles in metal; one of my favourite thrash bands, Vio-lence, has a singer that sounds like Invader Zim revved up on bath salts! But Tom's vocals just sound so outlandish, so (almost purposely) over-the-top that they completely pulled me out of the experience. And the worst part is, there really wasn't any reason for this vocal style; Tom's grunting style would have suited this song just fine, seeing how effectively it was used on earlier quasi-symphonic material like \"Necromantical Screams.\" Thankfully this track is a short-lived one, and the raging \"Inner Sanctum\" starts soon after. As soon as this song kicked in, I felt a wave of relief. This was one of the few songs from the album I'd heard before, and rightfully so; it's a mighty beast of a Frost track with great riffs and a memorable chorus. And the best part...no whiny vampire-vocals to be found! Thank fucking god! \n\nAfter that slice of thrashy goodness, \"Sorrows Of The Moon\" begins. Once again, a promising start. I calmly began to think the horrendous vocals were just a one-off deal. But to my horror, as soon as the slow melodic section starts, emo-vampire Tom Warrior rears his ugly head once more. Now I admit that it would make a bit more sense to use \"softer\" vocals on a track like this, but as before, his performance completely destroys any mood the song may have had.\n\nAs the album unfolded before my ears, I began to notice a pattern emerge. A new song would start, and sound very intriguing, indicating various places to go and styles to incorporate. Then Tom would start wailing and groaning like a moron and any momentum the song may have gained would halt in its tracks. This is made even worse on songs like \"Babylon Fell,\" where Tom randomly switches between both vocal styles for no apparent reason. And what really gets me is that almost everything else on this album works in the band's favour. Every experimental twist they add to each song, every subtle musical nuance they incorporate, from operatic back-up vocals to tribal rhythms, it all points to a band maturing and progressing with their career, ready and willing to try new things. Even the really weird stuff like \"I Won't Dance\" or the instrumental filler \"One In Their Pride\" sound different and interesting enough to hold your attention. But then here comes Tom Warrior, wailing and moaning like he's getting the best blowjob of his life, pissing away any build up of mood or atmosphere. How he decided to go with such a weird style and think it would work is beyond me. If he would have just stuck to his trademark growl and let the music do all the experimentation, I would probably be hailing this album as a masterpiece.\n\nBy the time it was over, I felt somewhat hollow. This album seems like its trying to shine with all its might, but is hampered by one fatal mistake that nearly ruins the whole experience, at least for me. Maybe some time in the future I'll be able to look past this flaw and appreciate the album even more, but for now I just can't. But in spite of what I've said, I still encourage people to check the album out for themselves. After all, it's become an influential landmark for a reason; it certainly sounds like no other metal album I've heard, and definitely has a lot more to offer than that abomination of a follow up, Cold Lake. Maybe you'll be able to look past the vocals on this album, maybe you'll hate them like me, or maybe you'll fall in love with them instantly. Go have a listen and judge for yourself.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026what will the wind bring these days?\u201d\n\nWhat Tom Fischer didn\u2019t know when he let that lyric sail is that in this instance the wind brings an ideal case-in-point for the old \u2018which one doesn\u2019t belong\u2019 game, for this 7\u201d falls easily into contention for that trophy. You\u2019re gonna run into a slap if I have to explain further. \n\nBeyond that obviousness, this is a curious little four-track sampler that's made more curious as it exhumes a few rarer-than-standard picks that newer archaeologist labels like Old Metal or Sentinel Steel wouldn't have to excavate to serve to us on silver trays, and that, my friends, is due to unassuming little outlets such as this. The problem is, however, that the disc\u2019s sleeve doesn\u2019t seem to have a clue what\u2019s bubbling inside it, nor who it\u2019s poised to impress. Yep, with its warm ocean-blue, decade-familiar, yet metal-unfamiliar pop \u201880s \u2018hey you, put down Rod Stewart and l00k at my big 1, dammit!\u2019 cover, it implies to...um...someone this 7\" has the #1 metal goods you\u2019re searching low and high for. Well, around 60% of the civilized world population was under the impression that Def Leppard\u2019s Hysteria was the latest heavy metal champion at the time, and since this disc is tattooed with underground and rather ignoble band names, it\u2019s only natural Sounds Waves was gonna be a hard sell to such an audience. Looking for a alternate horizon or perhaps a bigger picture, the disc squints at the .001% - the bedraggled few who are aware of and actually give a swig about underground metal \u2013 and naturally doesn\u2019t see a parking lot full of anywhere near semi-expensive rides being exited by adults with anywhere near semi-bulging wallets. So...who\u2019s gonna buy this thing? \n\nThen what makes this yet all the more a curious curio actually forms the solution to the last haunting question - as a promo release it\u2019ll be issued free with Sounds magazine, which even then was a long-running, well-respected rock rag that led early cheers for metal when NWOBHM was an acronym that meant very little to just about everybody. Gone are most complaints of wasted money, and the publicity\u2026ah, you can figure out the rest. \n\nSince \u201cVisual Aggression\u201d was already a warrior made fierce on Frost\u2019s 1985 The Emperor\u2019s Return ep, there was a minor chance it was already speed-racing recklessly somewhere in your collection, and if it wasn\u2019t\u2026well, then it should've been. Much obliged. Meanwhile, more hidden from view was Kreator\u2019s \u201cAfter the Attack\u201d, a song armed for slaughter along with the rest of Pleasure to Kill's dreadnoughts, yet was only to be found on that release\u2019s picture disc version, making this arguably the scarcest thing finding shelter here. \n\nI say arguably about \"After the Attack\" because, really, how often were/are The Stupids ever on the tips of anyone\u2019s tongues? I mean, even in the poorly dug ditch of underground metal, The Stupids were a hardcore band far underfoot and covered in indiscernible mud if they were in the ditch at all, and even today I never hear a syllable uttered about these guys. So basically if \u201cLive to Rock\u201d, actually an almost halfway decent h.c. specimen, wasn\u2019t the unicorn of the disc in 1988, it probably is now. \n\nThen there\u2019s\u2026yawn...ever-present Motorhead traipsing through \u201cKilled by Death\u201d, to me one of their stolidly standard and ultimately slow lane snoozers that could never spark even a moment\u2019s interest in me, and the so-called dazzle that comes from it being live from The Birthday Party at the Hammersmith Odeon video/album is only a big fizzle to someone who could care less about most live albums. Enter the last reason I throw a smile at this thing (yes, The Stupids beat out Motorhead. I\u2019ve lived with this truth for a few decades and still hold my head high. Now you can, too).\n\nShould be slightly more collectible than it is. \n\n\u201c\u2026everywhere starts the search for water and groceries\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\nWell, well, well...Celtic Frost's worst album, the rocker \"Cold Lake\". This album is Celtic Frost's worst experiment, but is it as bad as everyone says it is? Well...This album should not have been released by the mighty Celtic Frost. It should have been made as a side project, because this album really does not deserve to brand the Celtic Frost name. The band is not even thrilled with this album, which is why it is no longer in print or available to fans for purchase, unless you're willing to shell out one hundred dollars on eBay. Oh, the 1980's were both a fantastic time for metal, as well as a terrible time for metal. While CF's albums prior to this one showcase the excellence of the 80's metal scene, this one showcases the tragic aspect of it. Thrash and early death/black metal plagued the band's previous albums, making them all classics. This album, however, took a turn down the glam metal/hard rock sound and definitely steered the band in the wrong direction. Now, is this album all bad? No, actually.\n\nThis album, as mentioned previously, should not have branded the Celtic Frost name. Because it does, however, it had standards to live up to. \"Morbid Tales\", \"To Mega Therion\", and the experimental yet very interesting \"Into the Pandemonium\" are classic albums, all necessary listens for anyone who is trying to, or already does, listen to extreme metal. They all influenced the then-burgeoning first-wave black and early death metal scenes, but are also considered classics in the underground thrash metal scene. This album came out only one year after \"Into the Pandemonium\", so I imagine Celtic Frost fans were very excited about new CF music...until they popped the disk into their walkmans. They were treated to some type of radio-friendly metal that sounded like a more musically capable version of Twisted Sister or White Lion, but with more bite and slightly more aggression. I can just imagine the look on some of their faces...too bad I wasn't born until 1994, otherwise, I would have been right there with them. It takes a few listens to even appreciate this album as a decent hard rock album, because if this was released by some other less extreme band, it would probably have been highly regarded as one of the few albums in the glam genre that doesn't totally suck. \n\nThe guitar work on this album is actually pretty fun at times. There are plenty of good solos to go around, and this is one thing Celtic Frost has pretty much been good at their entire career. It doesn't really matter which album you listen to, with Celtic Frost, you're going to get amazing guitar work at best, and listenable guitar work at worst. This is their worst, so it's listenable most of the times, and also good at times. Take the guitar solos in \"Seduce Me Tonight\" (which is otherwise a very stupid song), \"Petty Obsession\", \"Cherry Orchards\", \"Little Velvet\", and \"Dance Sleazy\" (also a very stupid song otherwise). Those solos kick a ton of ass, and are easily the best moments on the entire album. The guitar work in \"(Once) They Were Eagles\" should be noted, too, as it is very groovy, especially in the intro. It is probably the most thrashy song on the album. This song does have a pretty cool solo in it as well. The guitar work is the best part of the album, and is usually not what Celtic Frost fans generally complain about when talking (or ranting, rather) about this album. \"Downtown Hanoi\" features some more good riffage, although it sounds like it could be on the radio, easily, which is one of my problems with this album. While the guitar work is actually cool most of the time, the sound overall is very commercial. What happened to the rawness of \"Morbid Tales\" and the experimental complexity of \"Into the Pandemonium\"?! Well...they wanted to be cool. So, they decided to be cool? Oh well, the guitar work is definitely somewhat of a highlight of the album, if not the only real highlight. \n\nThe drums are just generic. In fact, it seems like Stephen Priestly, who only played on two full-lengths with Celtic Frost, one being this one and the other being \"Vanity/Nemesis\" released in 1990, just played the same drumline throughout most of the album's duration. He is not playing the thrashy drums that Reed St. Mark played when he was in the band. Instead, he plays in a style that 1990's Metallica would use: simplistic drumming with no double bass or blast beats. Now, for what the style of music this album has, this style of drumming does its justice. Blast beats on a glam metal albums would sound like shit. They would be out of place and messy. So, if you came to this album for spectacular drumming, look away. If you wanted blast beats, double bass, d-beat, or any other style of drumming that comes with thrash metal, you won't find it here. The drumming is so simple, I am actually capable of playing it. And I don't consider myself a drummer, at all. The bass is not even audible so it's not worth talking about.\n\nNow....here we get to the worst part of the whole fucking album: the vocals. Or the \"singing\" or whatever the heck you want to call it. It's pretty bad, though. I don't know what Mr. Tom G. Warrior was thinking. Well...he obviously wasn't thinking clearly, because he let this album be released, but in all seriousness, this is his worst vocal job in the band's entire career. I'll be honest, I love Celtic Frost, always have and always will, but Warrior was never my favourite vocalist. Sure, he's good at what he does (except for this album) but there are definitely better vocalists out there. The vocals on this album sound very whiny at times, with the songs \"Little Velvet\" and \"Dance Sleazy\" in particular. However no matter how whiny the vocal performance on those songs are, \"Downtown Hanoi\" is his worst on the album. Just the way he says \"Downtown Hanoi\" irritates me. It's awkward and cheesy. If it weren't for the decent guitars on this album, the vocals would overshadow the guitars more than they do already and the album would be a lot worse. The lyrics are also downright stupid. See \"Seduce Me Tonight\" for example. I mean...really? The entire album's lyrical content is similar to that of Motley Crue's. \n\nSo basically, what we have here is something different from Celtic Frost, and while there is a silver lining in the form of guitar work, the albums is overall listenable at best, generic, average, nothing special at all...etc. If you want to get into Celtic Frost, check out their \"Morbid Tales\" album first. \n\nPros:\nGuitar work, particularly solos\nThe drums work for the style of music\n\nCons:\nStupid lyrics\nVocals aren't that good\nWhile the drums work fine, they are generic\nIt takes too much influence from glam metal\nToo much of a drastic change from their evil thrash sound of old\nNot enough variation\n",
        "\nAs if anyone needs another person telling them that this album should be passed up on when browsing this timeless band's discography, I figured I'd give the notion even more reinforcement. If you're wondering why I myself have and have listened to this album (willingly), it's actually really simple. I had every other album, so I figured I'd complete the collection. And to be honest, that is the only reason you should get this album. As far as entertainment value goes, this is a big ol' doodee dud. It stinks and is quite painful to listen to.\n\nBut if it were any other band (ya know, like a glam band), it'd be fine. Comparing this to Motley Crue and Twisted Sister and what have yous that I've listened to, musically this is actually better. The Warrior has always been a master songwriter, able to put that dreary, sludgy vibe on any riff he writes, and his ability to play unique solos has always been a subject of awe for me and others. Here, however, it seems as though he watered himself down to reach a more commercial sound. Where his guitars once had that great odd tone coupled with such force, like a haymaker thrown at an odd angle, now they kind of throw lazy jabs. No real force behind them, just a little taptaperoo to let you know it\u2019s there. But the tone is still vaguely there, that weird guitar tone that Tom still uses today on Triptykon (as I said, he gets that atmosphere on whatever and wherever he plays). Couple that with his drunken frog vocals he displays here as opposed to his tortured roar of the past and I must ask, 'how the fuck was this supposed to be commercial?'.\n\nThere's no doubt that\u2019s what this was an attempt to do; to try and get a foot in that mainstream door after the moderate buzz the band got after Into the Pandemonium, but who the fuck thought this would work? All in all, the album still sounds a bit darker than what the radio listeners want to hear, and your singer sounds so off-putting. Seriously, I don't think there is a vocal performance more awkward to listen to then on this album. This style of 'singing' would be used again, albeit much improved on Vanity/Nemesis, but here it's a bit of a mess. A mess that I could still get into if it wasn't for the main reason I leave this album with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nSo this actually sounds better than most glam albums, and I don't mind glam (LOVE YOU DAVID BOWIE! ;)). But what drags this album down to the bottom of the shit pile, is having to hear Tom Warrior, the man who challenged the metal (in particular extreme metal) world by writing thoughtful lyrics that are about subjects beyond sex, drugs, partying, women, and Satan, sing these lyrics. I laughed out loud when I first heard him awkwardly squeal \"Seduce me.... TONIGHT!\" It just isn't right. It doesn't fit the music, it doesn't fit his voice. From sexual serial killer Gilles de Rays and what\u2019s beyond life and all a matter of great subjects to tackle, to this drivel, in a feeble attempt to appease the masses petty obsession (ha) with the superficial. Dancing? Women? Sex? Come on Tom!! It almost physically hurts to hear these things by a band I so adore.\n\nDo you really need me to tell you about the bass tone and the drum fills and everything else? Why are you even still reading? Well, I will say as far as the stuff that keeps this thing's ugly head from going underwater goes, side 1 actually has a fair number of memorable moments. Ignoring the lyrics to Seduce Me Tonight, the chorus riff actually gets me bobbing my head a bit. They Were Eagles has some of that old school Frost thrash flavor to it that makes it probably my favourite on here. Cherry Orchards and Juices Like Wine are actually pretty decent overall, and though not as memorable musically as the aforementioned, they at least don't suffer too much from mind-numbing lyrics. \n\nSide 2 is mostly worthless other than the pretty rocking riffs of Downtown Hanoi. These recommendations really are just me grasping at straws, though. If you're going to buy this to complete your Celtic Frost collection, it's actually a pretty neat collectible as they probably will never re-release it. But, like me, even when you own it, you're going to have to force yourself pretty hard to listen to it, but I'll give it some points for its cool factor as a collectible and for the few memorable classic Warrior riffs. For those who don't collect and only buy to listen, I listened to it so you don't have to!\n\nFor trying to get their foot in the door while planting firmly on our faces, Cold Lake gets a generous 30 out of 100 or a 1 out of 5.\nHighlights:\n(Once) They Were Eagles\nIt's rare, and I like that kind of thing.\nThe outfits in the band pictures are worth a few chuckles.\n",
        "\nLying vacant for 14 years, the legendary Celtic Frost was risen from the ashes to give it one final go. They ended up changing their sound to an almost unrecognizable style. Taking their time, its took 4 years to write the material for this final offering making this album very mature and well written. Monotheist might be too different for some, and it even was for me when I first heard it, but transforming into a dark and heavy doom style wasn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nThomas Warrior's vocals make a dramatic change on this record compared to past albums. Taking a lower and more sludgier approach and even some cleaner angles on tracks like \"Obscured\" and \"Os Abysmi Vel Daath\". Fischer's vocals fit well with this new direction and really bring the darkness on these recordings. Fischer also throws in a few UHHH!!'s from the olden days that would make any old school fan smile. Martin E. Ain also has a nice vocal role in \"A Dying God Coming into Human Flesh\". Providing a clean monotone voice that is haunting and sets the mood for Fischer to apply his vocals roles as well. Other than Ain and Fischer, Simone Vollenweider supplies a great voice on the slower track s\"Obscured\" and \"Drown in Ashes\". Vollenweider and Fischer do a lovingly dark duet that is easily one of the best tracks on the album. Those with LP or the Japanese edition get a nice a-cappella piece featuring Vollenweider and her golden voice. \n\nThe guitars here are heavy as any good doom should be. Some nice riffs are also present chugging about and doing what they do best. \"Ground\" has a great riff that really screams doom as well as \"Domain of Decay\". \"Synagoga Satanae\" is another great track with tons of dark diminished riffs heavy enough to crack the streets of Manhattan. Other than heavy doom riffs, this album has some nice clean melodies on \"A Dying God Coming into Human Flesh\" and \"Obscured\". This album is rather lacking in solos, but thats not much to complain. The bass guitar from Ain is very buried in the thick layer of guitars and vocals that it is only heard in a few spots. But when the bass does decide to peek its head from the layer of chunky riffs and rotting vocals, the tone is rather dirty and very low as heard on \"Ground\".\n\nFranco Sesa does a fantastic job on drums. Supporting the sadness and diminished riffing with simple, tight beats. \"Obscured\" has a great swinging beats that rolls nicely over the ballad. \"Domain of Decay\" has a great fast beat with nice kick drum action and moody cymbal crashes. \"Ain Elohim\" has come nice double kick work and doomy beats that keep the song moving at a good pace. \n\nLyrics on this album are very depressing to say the least. Ranging from questioning God, losing love, and being reborn. There are some great lines on this record like ,\"Oh god, why have you forsaken me?\", from \"Ground\" and the \"No, no, no, no\" part on \"Obscured\" which is very haunting. \"Totengott\" is the intro to the epic Triptych has some rather strange lyrics that seem like nonsense but are very creepy along with the way the vocal presentation is distorted and manipulated.\n\nIn the end this is a great comeback album. Creating a great atmosphere molded by heavy guitars, pounding drums and Fischer's sludgy vocals, as well as mature and well written lyrics and song structures. This is definitely an album for any Celtic Frost fan, old or new, looking to try something new.\n",
        "\nNot going to lie when I say I am trying to focus on reviewing a Celtic Frost 90's demo while still thinking about some random chick I picked up from the bar last night and having to swallow my pride because it ended up with me having to chew my arm off like a wolverine to get the fuck away from here. Beer....the miracles it does to the opposite sex when it's in large quantities. So this little kidney stone of information I just jotted down might have some metaphorical comparison to what Celtic Frost was doing in 1993 and in a way at first it looks good but then after 2,3,4,5,6,7 beers it starts sounding better but listening to it sober it's not as pretty as that moment after you've down beer #10 or #11. With that said, this isn't bad. Not in the least bit. That would come in the form of their 2002 demo \"Prototype\" demo which thankfully never unearth for the general public to hear and for good reason. This is Celtic Frost still being heavy, but it does reek of some, a little 90's influences.\n\nRight off the bat, the music is heavy. I guess that's good right. I mean it should be one of those universal equations that is constant much like the number \u03c0 ( /pa\u026a/) is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, a.k.a. Celtic Frost = Crushing heaviness that blows minds and blackens the hearts.. ok, but when you consider CF's career and how they went from \"Morbid Tales\" to \"Into the Pandemonium\" on top of a downward slope with \"Cold Lake\" to a possible comeback with \"Vanity/Nemesis\" then you would have to consider that may be this is one of those fucking algebraic equations where nothing and PEDMAS doesn't help make sense of it so with that being said their \"In Session '93\" demo material is another variable thrown into that equation and still not making much sense because if there is one thing that Celtic Frost is known for is that music-wise they never made any damn promises. They never promised to make 10 albums precisely like \"Morbid Tales\". They never promised to be the ones who would shy away from controversy. In fact I don't think they made any promises to anyone but themselves and that's probably how they ended up like they did. Well this demo is another way of them showing them that no fucks were given to the public eye or minds in 1993 when they sunk into obscurity/semi-obscurity. This is not to say that their influence was felt, but as opposed to bands that were famous or on the rise in 1993, Celtic frost's career was right there next to Anvil that year in obscurity.\n\nMusically speaking this is much like \"Vanity/Nemesis\"....and that's not bad in the least bit. And it's also again a hodge-podge of various sounds, riffs, tempos, and productions. The world famous 11th Doctor from the BBC series Doctor Who said that time isn't a line but a bunch of various squiggley jumbly mumbly things all colliding and revolving around each other. He might as well have mention Celtic Frost because there are parts \"Vanity/Nemesis\", parts \"Into the Pandemonium\" and parts mainstream hard rock/metal in the form of groove Pantera. Yep. I didn't want to say it because I wanted to make sure but no there is a bit groove metal in there. It's more or less \"Cowboys From Hell\"-era Pantera, so it's tolerable even though it's noticeable. There's some start/stop riffs here as well. Songs like \"Devil In the Flesh\" start out with the Vanity/Nemesis sound and with some weird keyboards then that mainstream sound kicks in. It's not terrible, but you kinda see where this demo is headed. Celtic Frost practically invented the palm mute heavy down-tuned style that made not only them a household name but everyone pretty much took from them. So why isn't it working for them on this demo? Because the way Celtic Frost does it is a very specific way and tone. It's a hulking sized caveman taking on a Mastadon in the Ice Age. It's a primitive tone that sounds like tectonic plates moving. For 1993 that tone had evolved into something different and more acceptable and civilized I suppose. \"Pearl of Love\" starts off with those gothicky female vocals ala \"ITP\" era and goes straight into some decent straight-forward quasi thrashy/heaviness. \"The Man Who Would Weep\" is nothing more than \"Devil In the Flesh\" prt. 2. which is typical chugging CF. Nothing to memorable. \"Prime Evil Rapture\" opens up with a loud squealling guitar into what sounds like total 90's Alternative Metal....Tom G. puts his vocals through a vocoder for that \"underwater\" effect and then goes straight into more \"Vanity/Nemesis\" era material. Vocally I can hear Tom G. trying to sound like fucking Dave Mustaine ala mid-90's era. May be it's just me, but that's the feel I get for the most part. \"Icons Alive\" is.......man this demo is really just going through the emotions at this point. It just plods along with Tom G. Warrior not knowing what the fuck he wants musically. \"Carmina Burana\" starts off with synths and a drum machine? Wait is that Carl Orff's \"O Fortuna\"? Yep. Instead of the classic well-known sports-like anthem, we get a cheesy Goblin-esque italian horror style. The last song is shockingly the best one and unfortunately it's \"Untitled.\" Compared to how the rest of the demo was, this one actually seems it's going somewhere and has a direction. Nice guitar solo too. \n\nAnd there you have it. Another episode in Tom G. Warrior identical crisis in the 90's which lasted for a good while. In comparison to that unnameable abomination that was released in 2002....this one is nothing short of just lack of direction. The ideas, the heaviness, the samples, keyboards, it's there but it's a puzzle that wasn't placed properly. I'm sure if ol' Tom had tried a bit harder he would have come across something that was pure fucking gold but I guess the fallout from \"Cold Lake\" was still hitting the old boy a bit hard. Again we must be reminded of even Bathory who put out there fucking terrible \"Octagon\" album and the other artists who had once reigned in the early 80's underground to put out lackluster material during these bleak times. Regardless if they did it intentionally or whatever the case was, but for Celtic Frost, this was just another attempt at trying to find themselves which unfortunately hit it's worst in 2002 with their \"Prototype\" demo. For what this is....it's fair if anything.\n",
        "\nWell it's a good thing I never really knew (who else does for that matter? Why were we not informed of this release? What label put this out? May be there is a reason why this is a demo of sorts) ever fucking existed. And with those questions that I put in parenthesis it also lead to simply WHAT THE FUCK WAS GOING THROUGH THEIR GODDAMN MINDS? HOLY SHIT. I will fucking agree with autothrall on the notion that after this \"Cold Lake\" seems way more fucking enjoyable. I'll take Tom G Warrior in a CC Deville hairdo with his uber-beaky-fucking face and teethless gum smile/look he's always had with a jacket that looks like goddamn vomit....I'll that that bad version over this butt-fucking version of Celtic Frost. No, it cannot be. I know Tom G. Warrior went to do Apolloyon Sun and that same unused demo stuff from \"Vanity/Nemesis\" era stuff actually appeared somewhere in Apollyon Sun and now I am just fucking confused. Hold on, in internet troll speak/4chan speak....wut da fuq???\n\nLet's look at at this THING we have in front of us. The artwork is a Dimebag Darrel-esque generic fucking camo-painted guitar distortion pedal with the...Apollyon Sun logo on it? Some cyber-version of the heptagram? CFVII? Again wut da fuq??? And looking on the Metal-Archives.com website it was nothing more than a CD-R that came in a box that resembled a guitar pedal. So again it seems like and this is just my personal hunch that Tom G. Warrior was doing some lame shit with Apollyon Sun that nobody cared for. But if that's the case was he trying to make sure he was writing an album for Apollyon Sun that would never surface besides a few cassette demos much like what Celtic Frost disintegrated in the 90's admidst the singles and demos that never caught the attention to many Frost fans after the cold turkey and all that ancient history? Because the reason why I say all of this and continue going further and deeper into such questions is really not only based on the releases artwork but the music, or lack of, contained in this fucking abomination. It's going to get hairy here folks.\n\nNow I am a man of musical variety. I'm hurtling towards 30. I have come to become more eclectic as I have aged like a fine wine and so has Tom G's lyrics overtime, and I would love to sit here and tell you how different this is and I would even more so enjoy to comfort you in knowing that what you will here just might impress you.....BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS SUCKS SO FUCKING MUCH. HOLY SHIT. There is not one decent thing about these songs. Let's look at what year this was released in; 2002. Oh jesus :facepalm: Tom G. Warrior....why? Why? Why? Why? Why? I can just picture Tom G. Warrior in baggy Jnco Jeans and fucking the dredges of mallcore culture at Nu-Metal and just fucking shit music's height. This goes back to what I said about rather having Glam Version of Tom, at least that was half-way decent, this is just JUGGALO-WORSHIP MUSIC!!! Tom takes the worst of trip-hop beats and does something with them. He mumbles and whines over the fucking bloops and bleeps and mixes them in with his signature caveman riffs or what they TRY and sound like caveman riffs but plod through and sound more Nu-Metal. Even Tom's vocals sound very Jonathan Davis-esque in numerous songs here. At times you want to know if he is trying to sound like Rammstein, like Nine Inch Nails, or like fucking Korn or Insane Clown Posse. Level of shittiness? Asain motherfucker and it's not impossibru either!\n\nI feel like I am about to have a fucking panic attack now. This is an outrage. I mean I could go on and on and on on who, what, when, where, why, and possibly how this piece of fucking shit that thankfully escaped me and majority of the public eye in 2002 and thank-god but this is like trying to play \"Fester's Quest\" on Nintendo. This is like doing a military physical fitness test. This is like not being able to jack off for an entire 3 months. This is like the sad fact you can't watch a decent fucking show on TV anymore. You know that feeling when you take a shit and you go to wipe and you grab a hold of a nice-sized dingleberry in your ass hairs and then accidently tug it just enough to notice it but you know you have to yank it out and you end up ripping the hairs out around your anus? Yeah it sucks that fucking much. In the words of Bill Paxton from \"Aliens \"GAME OVER MAN! GAME OVER!\"\n",
        "\nHow do I even explain this live concert footage? Clunky. Sloppy. Lulzy. If you were like me as a kid and saw this in the back of Metal Maniacs magazine during your golden quest years to search for anything and everything metal-related (especially in the 90's) then you were beyond fucking dissapointed and let-down when you finally saw the product. Because you've heard how great \"Morbid Tales\" was right? But you never heard of their \"Cold Lake\" album up until then so you thought \"There's no way Celtic frost could put out something REALLY bad\"....well they did and they made a video which was just damaging to my young psyche as it did for frost fans in the 80's with the album. May be I lucked out with just seeing the video but still......it's 2012, can't they put some sort of fucking DVD out yet? \n\nHammersmith. Legendary concert hall and provided a place for numerous classic bands to perform at. Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Venom, etc. So Celtic Frost decided to record themselves during their career downfall period during the \"Cold Lake\" tour and good fucking god this is nothing short of appalling. First let's start off with the set-list. One or two songs from their \"Morbid Tales\" album, 3 songs off \"To Mega Therion\", and then a shitload from \"Cold Lake.\" Wait....no \"Inner Sanctum\", \"Babylon Fell\"? Oh wait \"Mexican Radio\" is all you hear from \"ITP\" and that's it. I know, I know this is from their dreaded \"Cold Lake\" era and if you didn't hear by now the whole back story this VHS was simply a way of Tom trying to give \"Cold lake\" the proper heaviness that the label wouldn't let him have or some bullshit reason because it still lacks any alibi that Tom G. Warrior had in trying to convince people that \"Cold Lake\" WASN'T a bad album? Good luck on that one. I won't lie, \"Cold lake\" had the potential but that was one lame fucking duck. Anyway back to the movie.\n\nIn some ways I suppose that this VHS DOES give the \"Cold Lake\" era a more heavier sound.....nahhh, I take that back. Far from it. More like gives some to sort of insight as to what it COULD sound heavier but still it's a sloppy performance of said material from the album. But even that said, just watching the band....just looking at the band and you can tell in Tom G. Warriors eyes in every fucking second that the concert is going on \"Man, I fucked-up....no seriously, this goes beyond fucked-up, this is just trying to convince people that Hitler didn't hate the Jews and he was a legit artist.\" Even the way the band is dressed. This is not the CF of \"Morbid Tales\" look with the eyeliner and spikes or the quasi-fluffy shirt goth look of \"ITP\"....nope this is Tom G. Warrior in a jacket/shirt that looks like someone threw-up allover it and gave him a CC Deville hair style. Understandable that it was the 80's, but did the make-up artist notice that Tom has one beaky fucking nose? Imagine said haircut on Martin E. Ain's elongated face. Weird.\n\nWith all of this said, I still have yet to REALLY get to the live performance. Again it's lulzy to say the least bit. And for the millionth time it's Tom G. Warrior trying to show how \"Cold Lake\" could have sounded if given a heavier mix or the proper sound, but it fails and whenever they play their older stuff it lacks the punch or power or heaviness with Reed St. Mark and Martin E. Ain's presence. The musicians who are covering CF are doing it half-assed. Even when you hear \"Jewel Throne\" and.....it's the sound and sign of a train headed fucking nowhere coming to a screeching fucking halt. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to show anyone. If you can find an old used copy view it for yourself but don't say I didn't warn you. It flat out sucks.\n\nP.S. AND NO THAT'S NOT A BULLET BELT HE'S WEARING ON THE FRONT VHS BOX COVER DAMNIT!\n",
        "\nFew bands have practiced the dark arts with such alacrity as Celtic Frost. Their music spans deep divisions, alters dimensions, and supplants structures that they themselves had a heavy hand in creating. They are the elder gods, transcendent. They have stumbled, they have fallen. Having wielded power beyond most bands imaginings, they sank into derision before vanishing into dormancy, recultivating, awaiting the right moment to arise through flame and supplant those who dared worship at the altar of others. Monotheist undoes years of damage with a dark tongue. It is a monolithic statement on the enduring quality of transcendent art and a testament to those few restless souls unafraid to embrace it. \n\nFew bands have crafted a legacy as enduring and encompassing as the almighty Frost. Their crude initial outbursts as Hellhammer formulated thrash and death metal. Morbid Tales embraced a radical template for experimentation in speed and groove. To Mega Therion forged a doom different from those intent on gimmicking Sabbath. And Into The Pandemonium demonstrated a crystalline dedication to outside influence and experimentation that ultimately wrecked the band. That said, the linear evolution left long ley-lines of influence, gathering nearly all forms of crude, heavy, aggressive music under one ever-altering banner. With Monotheist, Celtic Frost discards all failed experiments to once again stand alone on a precipice of excellence few bands ever dare approach.\n\nAs always, Frost challenge themselves. The music recorded here is fuckin' bleak and harrowing, laced with tension and a darkened atmosphere against which few others can truly compare. This is true doom: end-of-the-world within music, despairing and transgressive at once -- catharsis through heaviness and earnest emotion, the wrestling with themes and feelings beyond oneself. Martin Ain and Tom G. Warrior have crafted lyrics resonant of poetry and philosophy without sinking into pretentious trappings of pseudo-intellectual nihilism -- there is transcendence here, a working through pain and grief via auditory incantation: an exorcism recorded. \n\nThe music is vicious and snapping. The guitars snarl like mutant hellhounds, cutting across wide swaths of aggressive, repetitive chord figures. Threading the needle of blackened textures that weave darkened beauty into dementedly heavy chugging grooves has become a Tom G. Warrior specialty. The riffing on this record is so far removed from Morbid Tales and yet it sings singularly of Frost. Martin Ain's bass is cranked deep and rumbling, his voice shading in terrified harmony behind Tom's varied vocalizing. The drums are are especially noteworthy, hitting resonant tribal rhythms akin to Goths set loose in Rome. \n\nThe songwriting is dense and complex, embracing strains of avant-garde classical, ambient, and industrial passages that sing out for a moment and then scatter, reintegrated into the moribund heaviness like the last gasp of a dying civilization under the tramping foot of an unstoppable army. Tom's duet with Lisa Middelhauve on \"Drowned In Ashes\" is hauntingly beautiful; as is the divine \"Incantation Against You,\" with its soft Gregorian choral work undergirding Simone Vollenweider's ethereal singing. Entirely acapella, this track flirts with Dead Can Dance level gothic beauty. But such beauty is fleeting beneath the punishing wrath of such tracks as \"Progeny,\" \"Ground,\" & \"Os Abysmi Vel Daath\" -- twisted compositions of charnel house horror with superbly punishing riffs and hypnotic vocal invocations. These tracks are a fresh twist on an ancient sound: Celtic Frost 2.0 and beyond.\n\nIn recognition of their own dormancy, Frost aggregates their influences as well, handing listeners a complex aural knot of mutual reciprocation: \"Temple Of Depression\" sounds almost exactly like Coroner circa Grin, just darker and heavier, like an admission to the fact that the greater Frost sound is actually a darkening strain of DNA against which few have managed to innoculate themselves. So if you hear shades of other bands on here, don't think Frost unoriginal. The mythical alchemists have returned to transmute what others have accomplished in their absence. And in doing so, they have (with one quick sweep of the hand) brushed the majority of their peers and followers aside. Monotheist is a dark masterpiece of the highest order and one of the greatest metal records of all-time.\n",
        "\nAfter experiencing their Prototype recording earlier in the 21st century, I had no hope that Celtic Frost would ever be returning to the level of artistry and quality that they once reached through their mid-80s albums To Mega Therion and Into the Pandemonium. It had become clear that 'creativity' wasn't an issue, since Warrior was experimenting with industrial/electronics, and even awful hip hop influences, but it felt wholly misguided. Imagine the surprise then, when just a few years later, after a lot of effort and hard work, the Swiss idols would release another heavy album to great praise, with worldwide distribution through Century Media. Arguably, this was the Celtic Frost record fans had been waiting on for nearly 20 years, but its uncompromising, massive sound was also welcoming towards those decades of newer fans who came up on death and black metal, extremities who in part owe their existence to this band's very legacy.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel like the huge production and overwhelming grooves on the album have gone a long way towards its popularity, and less concern seems to be placed upon the actual construction of the riffing or enduring nature of the tracks. Don't mistake me for someone who hates the album, because after a gulf of 10 years, Monotheist was a breath of relief that the band had stopped fucking around. I like it alright, and listen to it once in a great while, but there is no chance in hell that it's quite so great as many would seem to believe. Greatest comeback ever? Work of genius? Absolutely not. Celtic Frost's primal riffing was a boon in the 80s, a clever antithesis to the increasing complexity of the thrash and speed metal scenes, but there in 2006 a lot of the guitar patterns felt irritably derived, and I'm rather surprised that it took Warrior, Ain and their new band mates '4 years of songwriting' to arrive at what a group of 'core kids jamming on the corner of my street could have come up with in 15 minutes in an afternoon session.\n\nOf course, Celtic Frost are more or less cashing in debts on something they had a heavy hand in first creating. A lot of the palm muted chugging that filtered on down through thrash, hardcore and groove metal scenes first originated with bands like this who played them with muscle, and so if Monotheist often reminds me of younger acts that broke out through the 90s, then they're automatically forgiven. Some of the open, groovier low end open note rhythms in tracks like \"Ground\", \"Progeny\" or \"Ain Elohim\" remind me of the first two albums from New Yorkers Life of Agony due to that voluminous guitar tone. More surprising, the whole album reeks of a modern doom metal effort more than any other specific genre. Granted, works like Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion had a huge impact on a lot of the death/doom that originated from England like Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride, almost as much as Sabbath, but this is the first Celtic Frost record that I would classify as predominantly doom, with a hint of their formative, thrashing fervor. Not a bad thing, per se, but it certainly plays into how one experiences the album.\n\nFor any who might have worried that Frost had lost its 'worldliness', fear not. Touches of Into the Pandemonium's eclectic nature are retained here, even if they're in the minority. Examples include \"Incantation Against\", a Mesopotamian inspired guest vocal piece by featuring Simone Vollenweider's gorgeous voice against a brooding, monotonous male choir backdrop. \"Os Abysmi Vel Daath\" features alternations of crushing, simplistic riffs with some dark noise passages; while \"A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh\" opens with brooding, dark clean guitars and desolate crooning by the man himself. There are also a number of guest slots throughout the album like Satyr and Peter T\u00e4gtgren lending vocals for the 14 minute slog \"Synagoga Satanae\", or Ravn from 1349 appearing on \"Temple of Depression\". Considering how many death and black metal bands pay tribute to Frost on a normal basis, it makes a lot of sense that that various personas would have been lining up to contribute. In general, though, Monotheist is far less dynamically ranged than Into the Pandemonium, perhaps even less than To Mega Therion: as a whole it congeals into a very consistent, depressing experience.\n\nThere are two primary suspects holding me back from appreciating this comeback as fully as some of my peers. First: the guitar riffs. I like that they're crude and loud, almost as if Warrior was reaching back into the primordial ooze from which he first shaped Hellhammer for a new strain of pummeling slime to unleash upon his followers. But the actual patterns of notes are so often treacherously dull and uninspired, 'first thing that came to mind' progressions that might thrill people attuned solely to the leaden distortion and Franco Sesca's concrete foundation, but seem to lack all the charisma of their old songs. Whereas \"Return to the Eve\" or \"Circle of the Tyrants\" have survived for 20+ years in my memory, feeling fresh even today, something like \"Ground\" or \"Obscured\" is almost impossible for me to recall even a week later. The guitars were such a prominent feature of their classics, but here they might just belong to any other run of the mill doom metal band of Sabbath lineage. They are no way even nearing impressive, and this is a fault I also found with the subsequent Triptykon debut, which has an even more brazen and 'bigger budget' production sound.\n\nSince the guitars don't really stand out other than their tone, they rely all too heavily on the pacing of the beats and the lyrical narrative to fuel the album, and this leads me to my other major complaint against Monotheist: the lyrics very often suck from the same bone that they did with the Prototype demo. Lots of 'I am I am I am I am' which appears in about half the songs on the frickin' album, and far too much repetition of lines like 'Oh God, why have you forsaken me?' (\"Ground\") or 'I am a dying God, coming into human flesh' (guess the track), 'I deny my own desire' (\"Os Abysmi Vel Daath\"), etc. I realize that the actual purpose behind the lyrics is to provide a dark, hypnotic and tormented mantra alongside the simplicity of the riffing, but with so little to enjoy in the guitars themselves, I found that the lyric patterns and choruses seemed lazy and forgettable, as if partially inspired by a lot of miserable groove and nu-metal acts throughout the 90s who had the poetic eloquence of a manhole cover. It's not that what is being said is not 'important', but it's just not being said by the most interesting means.\n\nTom, on the other hand sounds pretty damn good. He had clearly aged, but his gruff bark has lost little power over the years. It even seems a little more daunting and acidic among the concrete chords that carve out \"My Domain of Decay\". His froglike gutterglam whines circa Cold Lake have been supplanted by a cleaner, wavering Gothic tone which, while not as charismatic as his lines on \"Mesmerized\" or \"Babylon Fell\" from Into the Pandemonium, is acceptable enough on a depressive, atmospheric droning cut like \"Obscured\" (on which he's joined by female vocals to provide what must be the catchiest single passage on the whole of the album). The new rhythm section seems to gel together quite nicely, granted they're not doing so much outside of accenting the guitars, but there's a more tribal nature to Sesa's performance than I can recall from Reed St. Mark or Stephen Priestly. Ain contributes backing vocals and writing, and the new guitarist Erol Unala (who had been with them since Prototype) is a fitting match for Warrior.\n\nIn the end, Monotheist overcomes my sizable gripes if only because it still provides an alluring atmosphere in which the listener can drown him or herself for 70 minutes, and has a few aural climaxes scattered about its cratered, sorrow-scarred surface that compensate for its ruddy, often overbearingly and tactless gloom. It's a good example of a cult act adapting itself to a modern environment without losing all of its identity, though as we know it was not exactly the most seamless of transitions (listen to the two prior demos, or the 'glam' phase). The cover image is great not only because it sticks with you, but it also matches the haunted aesthetics of the music. That aside, this is not an album I want to render down to its individual components very often, or I'll become too annoyed with the lackluster architecture of the riffs and the general predictability of the songs as they stray forth into the apocryphal dusk.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nPrototype is both the strangest Celtic Frost recording and what might lamentably represent the biggest identity crisis in their history, but unlike the Nemesis of Power demo 10 years earlier, I can hardly blame it for laziness or lack of trying. Self released with gimmick guitar pedal packaging and brazen album title, it looks nothing like any of the band's backlog. In fact, if not for the Cold Lake icon in the right corner, the 'CF VIII' scrawled across the bass of the pedal, and a few of Tom's vocal lines through the heavier tunes, it would be quite difficult to qualify as a true Celtic Frost release, but more of an extension of Warrior's work in the industrial metal outfit Apollyon Sun in the later 90s. That said, Tom's mainstay was no stranger to experimentation, and so I can't say I was highly surprised when I first heard this. Only that it hadn't arrived sooner.\n\nProtoype has a more sleek, modern production than anything Warrior had written to date, and the substantial track list leads me to believe that it was intended as some 'missing link' full length to fill in the gaps of the band's history. Sadly, though, it's quite thoroughly awful, despite the rather eclectic mix of ingredients. Normally I have no opposite to the inclusion of electronics, or even pop and hip hop elements to a heavier recording if they contribute to some sense of intrigue, compulsion or just some damn catchy songwriting, but here they seem misused as a tired set of cliches, a very 90s-esque 'open mindedness' that seeks to force an exhibition of the band's diversity. At its very best, the demo/album is competent and subtle with its external influences, but at worst it's a dire mockery of all good taste, tragically lame to the point that it takes on a bad, cartoon-like quality...\n\nLet's just say that, from where this demo BEGINS, you have little to no idea how it will END, but we're not talking about unexpected thrills or 'twists' that one might deem pleasurably; rather an air traffic accident that initially seems as if it will cause only minor structural damage to a craft's landing gears but then ends up on the nightly news, hundreds of dead being pulled from the still smoking wreckage. Essentially, the first two tracks are a sort of 'trance' techno, with beats that loop alongside a modicum of glitch electronics, feedback and ominous, crunchy bass against the backdrop. The cyber rendition of the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" is quite interesting, and even if I don't dig how the lyrics grind across the heavily affected guitar samples and beeping noises, it was at least worth a try. \"Totgetanzt\" is an original, with even sparser, pulsing textures, sinister breath whispers and cheesy keyboard beats, but nothing as interesting as the cover ever occurs.\n\nAnd then we come to the 'heavy' sequence of the demo, where drudging, muted guitars are affixed to drum machine and samples in a means redolent of Pitch Shifter, or maybe the late 90s Prong material with enhanced electrics. Warrior gets rather aggressive with his vocals on \"The Dying I\" or the occasional guffaw in \"Human Dirt\", but elsewhere he uses a sort of nasal, whining vocal that reminds me of Jonathan Davis from Korn. The lyrics are quite miserable through this portion of the track list, with a lot of generic call and response style chorus parts and generic 'what I am what I am what I am' (\"Human Dirt\") effortless bullshit lyrics that were a heavy symptom of bad 90s alternative rock, industrial, early metal core and groove/nu-metal. The heavily atmospheric electro rock duet \"November\" features Tom's whimpering alongside a female guest, and \"Deep Inside\" (one of two Apollyon Sun tracks that wound up here) is a passable trip hop tune with some psychedelic guitar swirl backing the chorus, but even the latter becomes incredibly cheesy when it hits the classical piano bridge with the girl whispers: 'deep inside deep inside'. Oh so sexy, guys! Not.\n\nBut, honestly, I'd take ANY OF THIS over what happens at the end of the demo, where it transforms from merely misspent creative energy into an outright abomination, as if a bunch of ICP juggalos decided to stick bananas in their wrestling thongs and then invade the recording session, bribing Tom with drugs to let them in the studio booth. \"Get Wicked (dagger and grail edit)\" is some weird interlude with a dude rapping in...French, I think? It's bad enough that we must suffer its reckless stupidity, but the guy actually has the audacity to include the phrases 'get down get down' in nearly the same breath as he cries 'procreation of the wicked'. At this point I am well on my way to caving in my face with handgun rounds, but Prototype actually gets WORSE, with the heinous and inane \"Hip Hop Jugend\", a hybrid of porn electronics, bad German Rammstein rambling, smutty 'ooh baby aah baby' female narrative and a bunch of manly Eurotrash shouts of 'Hip Hop Jugend' in the background.\n\nSeriously, I dare anyone to listen through this song and then tell me again how miserable you think Cold Lake is. If you can make it through without cracking a smile or choking on a combination of laughter (at it, not with it) and vomit, then I certainly owe you a beer. But trust me, it will haunt you forever...the final nail in the coffin of failed ideas that permeate Prototype. As we all know by now, this direction was not one Warrior and Ain pledged to continue, its awkward and unnecessary mutation silently sealed away in vaults of agonizing regret that only a handful were so unfortunate to experience. Monotheist would later steer the band back on track, an acceptable compensation for 10 years of bullshit, but personally I'm not sure it could ever outlive scars like this.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOne might expect an influential, iconic band of Celtic Frost's stature to rough out the 90s with considerable dignity, but if the Nemesis and Power demo, recorded to prod some post-Noise label interest, is any indicator, then the Swiss folded at exactly the right time to avoid humiliating themselves on a level Cold Lake could only have dreamed of. The content of this demo is hands down the most embarrassing and pedestrian songwriting I've ever heard from the band, making their glamorous 1988 faux pas seem glorious by comparison, and Hellhammer seem lucratively sophisticated. Clearly Tom and his troops had run full out of steam, and at best the material here offers a few half-assed special effects that themselves would have required heavy development to pass muster.\n\nOh, I get that it's a 'demo' recording. I get it, believe me. It was never meant to greet the ears of wriggling and opinionated scum such as myself, but let's be blunt: if the best thing your demo has going for it is a semi-industrial, dorky cover of an obvious Carmina Burana chorus, you're in a serious spot of trouble. I mean, it's not as if Celtic Frost was some heinously unknown garage band. They might have yet to become such cult figures as they are in the 21st century, but even at this point they'd already released a pair of marvelous albums and another pair of classic EPs going back almost a decade before this. Even if they were riding the misfortune of a few dud albums, record label troubles and lineup changes, the songwriting here is uninteresting, dull, and often inexcusably so. This was more or less the same lineup as Vanity/Nemesis, only with the bonus of having Reed St. Mark back on the drums, so for the songs to be THIS bad I can only surmise that: a) they were written in 15 minutes while they were showering and shaving, or b) Tom Warrior was abducted by a thrash band of 13-year olds down the street and forced to add his earnest, froglike voice to their recording. I'll go on and rule out substance abuse, because frankly, this is just not that inspired...\n\nI realize that Celtic Frost was never some bastion of riffing technicality, but their simplified palm mutes and groove rhythms were generally so well conceived that they compensated via their raw barbarity. Here, the guitars seem like the 'my first thrash riff' collection of some insipid teenager with two weeks training, only the kid in question would never have presumed that they might make for decent songs capable of generating interest. \"Devil and the Flesh\", \"The Man Who Would Weep\", \"Primeval Rapture\" and the 'untitled' track, \"Under Apollyon's Sun\" (which also appeared on the Parched With Thirst Am I and Dying compilation) all contain some of the least impressive muted noted progressions I have heard in my life, to the point that they make the infant nu- and groove-metal acts of this period seem like skilled composers. The drums are pretty simplistic, without much of the blunt force trauma Mark was meting out on the earlier recordings, and the bass is so antagonistically pathetic that it pretty much copies the worthless guitar lines.\n\nThere is still an undercurrent of eccentricity here in the choice of female vocals for \"Pearl of Love\" (which also featured the origin of a Monotheist riff), the strange vocal filter in \"Primeval Rapture\" which occasionally feels like Mustaine snarling, or the aforementioned industrialized intermission with its chants and choirs and meaty beats, but when rubbed against such a sodden and lamentable collection of riffs as, say \"Icons Alive\", any sense of fascination and wonder is immediately depleted. And, really, after hearing Into the Pandemonium, how could any of this seem even remotely exotic or avant-garde. Tom's vocals continue to strafe the border between the more aggressive grunts of his past and the febrile whining of Cold Lake, and are not once impressive, but the presence of such treacherously prosaic guitars overshadows any of the agony and regret they might otherwise impose...\n\nI cant chide the band too hard, because obviously they were well cognizant of the fact that this material wasn't going to get them anywhere. Yet the very fact that it exists in even the most amateur, covert form is sad indeed, more evidence of an 80s titan falling to the wayside. At least Celtic Frost didn't attempt to 'keep up with the times' by mutating into an all out alt rock, grunge, rap or techno industrial project, right?\n\nRig...oh...yeah.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost might have dragged their heels in an unwelcome and unwanted glam fetish for a few years, or released a few lacking short form products through their career, but one thing they could never be accused of is ripping off their fan base by capitalizing on such an enormous cult status as they've garnered these past decades. Just how many useless, redundant Best of Celtic Frost compilations might we have suffered it Tom G. Warrior and his backers turned a blind eye to their dignity and quality control and dropped to their knees to fluff the almighty dollar?\n\nIt says a lot that, when a fan collection did finally arrive in the form of Parched With Thirst Am I and Dying via Noise Records, that it was so loaded with re-recordings, rare or unreleased tracks, and other odds and ends that don't wind up feeling like a track by track repressing of studio material that they've already turned a buck off. That doesn't make all of its content invigorating, or unique to this one album, but in general this would hold a lot of appeal to an audience of the time who might not have been saturated in the CD re-releases (with bonus tracks). What's more, if you're lucky enough to have gotten the 1999 re-issue of the compilation, it features about 30% more content. This is the version I'm covering here, and the version I'd recommend you hunt down if you're in the market for the odds and ends of your Swiss heroes.\n\nThere are, of course, a few cuts here which might have been omitted in favor of other demo reels, live cuts or rarities, most of which are taken straight from the Vanity/Nemesis album: \"Wings of Solitude\", \"The Hearth Beneath\", \"The Name of My Bride\", and a couple oldies in \"Circle of the Tyrants\" (Morbid Tales) and the French version of \"Tristresses de La Lune\" which was available on the US release of Into the Pandemonium. All good or amazing choices, but not necessarily relevant to the interests of fans who already owned them. The radio edit of \"I Won't Dance (The Elders Orient)\" and \"Cherry Orchards\" are also unwarranted, neither superior or markedly different than their fuller studio incarnations. The raw studio jam of \"Return to the Eve\" with the added Reed St. Mark vocals is also here, but this too we've heard before on the Tragic Serenades EP or CD re-issue of To Mega Therion; nor do I care about the jam version of \"Mexican Radio\" much either, or \"The Usurper\" with Ain's bass that was also already on Tragic Serenades.\n\nBut the other half of the compilation is far cooler, or at the very least, it tries to be. For example of the latter: a pair of 1991 re-recordings of tunes from the ill-fated Cold Lake have been included, with a bit more aggression and better vocals. In the case of \"Downtown Hanoi\", it's not a huge difference since that was one of the heavier tracks on the album to begin with, but for \"Juices Like Wine\", the verse vocals feel stronger. The chorus is still a bit whiny, and drier than the Cold Lake rendition, but just about everything else might sate fans who hated that. It's nice that they've decided to toss \"A Descent to Babylon (Babylon Asleep)\" on here from the Wine in My Hand EP (1990), since it removes any and all impetus outside of collection to acquire that piece of crap, but it's still not one of the band's better tracks from the Vanity/Nemesis era.\n\nAnd lastly, the real 'goodies'! Or, rather, the ones you were really waiting for, even though they don't turn out to be so memorable. \"In the Chapel, in the Moonlight\" has at last been culled from the rare, limited edition Collector's Celtic Frost vinyl (1987), and while not totally impressive, the grimed out vocals, timpani and the trudge of the riffing place it firmly within the Into the Pandemonium period, though it is nowhere near good enough to have belonged on the full-length. \"The Inevitable Factor\" and \"Journey Into Fear\" are both decent tunes, the first with a nice set of grooves and Tom's Gothic grousing; the latter with a primal punk thrust and thrash breakdown circa Morbid Tales or Emperor's Return. \"Idols of Chagrin\" was a brand new piece made for this album, but I can't say it's a favorite. Lots of more generic rock grooves to the guitar riffs, and though the harsher frog vocals, plodding bass breaks and the guitar tone are all well produced, the riffs are far from standout. \"Under Apollyon's Sun\" is superior, though the primary guitar line is familiar to others they've written in the past, and the vocals are mediocre.\n\nBut at least this last pair I've mentioned give us a hint of how the band's production would have sounded with a theoretical direct followup to Vanity/Nemesis which never manifest, and they are certainly better (sounding) than what they wrote for their Nemesis of Power demo in '92. In the end, I'm not sure that the positives of Parched exceed its mediocre elements. There's a real sense of resolution and completeness here, authored by a band that cared what it was placing on the shelves for its followers to gobble up. Pieces are drawn from all over the canon. But at the same time, there are enough redundancies to drag its value down, and there's not a single track of the unreleased rarities here that deserved to be on one of the Frost full-lengths. It makes perfect sense that they'd end up here, but just because they're novel to the devoted listener does not render them into works of appreciable quality.\n\nThe new songs were, truthfully, underwhelming. Boring even. Engineering aside, if they had released a full length with such lackluster composition it would have flopped even harder than Cold Lake. They're just not memorable, an attribute critical to all of their classics. The other rarities are a mixed bag: \"Journey Into Fear\" and \"The Inevitable Factor\", the two best on this collection, are still not up to the level of album tracks. So there's a real sense of 'leftovers' which permeates the compilation, flabby non-athletics that would never have been picked for any volleyball team, and in conjunction with the cut and paste tracks or minor edits that represent about 50% of its play list, the best I could consider this is average. Not as worthless as many other collections of its type, but not all that inspired in retrospect.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWine in My Hand (Third from the Sun) is just another of the myriad 'who gives a shit' singles or EPs that have always been released near or alongside full-length albums to scam a few more bucks off a band's audience. The real attraction here is the non-album cut \"A Descent to Babylon (Babylon Asleep)\" which never made it onto the original pressing of Vanity/Nemesis, but the titular video tune and the cover of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" have no more impact than anywhere else. Coupled with the gaudy, terrible and unrelated choice in comic book cover art which looks like a mash-up of the Mighty Thor and.... well, SOMETHING riding a missile, it's value is exponentially lessened and even more questionable than the band's Tragic Serenades EP circa 1986.\n\nWas this 'fan art', submitted for the EP? Were they just smoking crack-cocaine? I'm willing to bet that both might have been involved. Anyway, \"Descend to Babylon (Babylon Asleep)\" is not a track to entirely scoff at. There's a nice thrashing mute groove in the verse and a couple slower passages over which the lead trills, but the rhythm guitar beneath the second fragment of the solo seems like a knockoff of several other mid-paced riffs from the full-length. It's pure Celtic Frost, with a mix of Warrior's gruff verbal constipation and a few of the Cold Lake whining lines, but in general I don't find it to be so memorable or interesting as several of its neighbors over on Vanity/Nemesis, and I can sympathize with the decision to leave it off. Otherwise, the other two tracks are identical to the full-length, and thus completely redundant, worthless to me here.\n\nWhat's makes this even more of an insignificant release is the fact that \"Descend to Babylon\" has been re-issued twice, through both the Parched With Thirst Am I And Dying compilation (in 1992) and the 1999 Vanity/Nemesis reissue. So, for anyone (and really, EVERYONE) who has since gotten their hands on either, owning the EP is a real non issue. Collectors might want the CD or vinyl editions for completion's sake, but I doubt even they want to stare at it very long, lest it cause cancers to grow behind their eyeballs.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nYou'll never catch me tripping over myself with ardor for the fourth Celtic Frost full-length Vanity/Nemesis, but at the very least it served as a redress or re-assessment of the tragically flawed 1988 flop Cold Lake. Shortly after that record was released, founder and vocalist Warrior performed a bit of 'housecleaning' by sending Oliver Amberg on his merry way, presumably for the betterment of all. He retained the services of drummer Stephen Priestly and guitarist Curt Victor Bryant (never trust a guy with three first names!), and also got Martin Ain involved again with the songwriting, though he only performs bass on \"The Hearth Beneath\" and contributes a few of the backing vocals throughout. A third guitarist, Ron Marks was used for session recording, and Bryant and Warrior also performed some of the bass lines, so there seemed like a real sense of collaboration and unity to the record, most of its constituents involved in multiple roles.\n\nExtraneous elements like shitty hip hop intros and glam lyricism might have been cast to the wayside here, but Vanity/Nemesis certainly preserves a few of Cold Lake's aesthetics. The band's image hadn't changed a great deal, for one, and Tom's use of the whining, frog-like vocal is still manifest on a number of the compositions. Priestly's drums are still as pop-rocky as they were on the previous album, and in truth the snare seems even tidier, polished sounding to the point that it comes off a bit sterile. Frost was not about to relapse back to the double kick beats Reed St. Mark was fond of, but Stephen is otherwise up to the task. Female vocals are featured even more prominently, from the seductive whispers of \"The Heart Beneath\" to the more soulful style in \"Wings of Solitude\" which recounts \"I Won't Dance (The Elders Orient)\" from Into the Pandemonium, but here they seem to assimilate themselves far more assertively alongside Warrior and the heavier tone of the riffs...\n\nAnd there is where the primary difference lies, the foremost reason that Vanity/Nemesis hasn't evoked such sour grapes as its predecessor, and sustains respect from many Frost fanatics even today. The heavier, chugging guitars, while not necessarily any more complex than Cold Lake's harder hitters like \"Downtown Hanoi\" or \"Roses Without Thorns\", carry a more tangible emotive power that resonates down through the years with a mystique akin to Into the Pandemonium, if glazed in the muscle enhancement of To Mega Therion. I can't be the only one who feels that this album is still a strange bastardization of glam/hard rock and thrash aesthetics, but there is a mightier furor to the chugging elements in tracks like \"The Heart Beneath\", \"The Name of the Bride\" and \"Nemesis\" that makes it all the more to take seriously. Hell, a few of the cuts like the ill-titled \"A Kiss or a Whisper\" resurrect the punkish panache that thrived on their earlier PE Morbid Tales, and here Priestly lets the double bass rip.\n\nMid-paced thrashing (\"The Restless Seas\", \"Nemesis\") is where this album seems most effective, and Frost resumes the throne of palm muted groove momentum without leaving behind the eros, eloquence and philosophical rambling of their lyrical matter. Acoustics are teased here, beneath the eaves of \"Wings of Solitude\", or just beyond the throwback \"Into the Crypts of Rays\" intro of \"Nemesis\", and they glint with appropriate sorrow, the latter dowsed in a bluesy if forgettable lead. A few tunes seem a little strange and dorky, like the hilariously named \"Phallic Tantrum\" with its goofy, happy verse thrashing and pinched, whiny Warrior pitch. \"Vanity\" and the covers of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" and Bryan Ferry's \"This Island Earth\" also seem a tad on the light side for Celtic Frost. Don't get me wrong, it was interesting to hear their muscled alterations to the source material, but they're hardly evocative of the crushing nightmares that so memorably speckled the band's morbid past.\n\nI will say that the first chunk of the album, specifically the first four songs, are very well handled and even exclusive of the rest of Vanity/Nemesis, they surpass Cold Lake with ease. The open chords, grooves and sexy whispers that permeate \"The Heart Beneath\" all ramp up to a dirty but effective lead, and the whole things sounds quite damned heavy despite the polish. \"Wine in My Hand (Third from the Sun)\" was the first 'single', given its own EP and a rather lame, largely rock star video treatment; but the song is quite cool, especially the thick verse riffing, and the chorus in which the vocals are affixed to the percussive, escalated wail of the guitar. Tom sounds a lot heavier here, returning to the harder bark he implemented on Dethroned Emperor or To Mega Therion. \"Wings of Solitude\" chugs along with confidence until the acoustic break, and I love where it opens back up to the huge chords and soulfully backed 'beauty and the beast' chorus. \"The Name of My Bride\" might occasionally sound a whole lot like a Frost take on Megadeth's \"In My Darkest Hour\", thanks to the chord progression in the verses, but it's still rock solid throughout, with a nice lead.\n\nUltimately, though, the album lacks so much of the novel, poignant menace of To Mega Therion or the breathtaking exoticism of Into the Pandemonium that it never quite launches itself to that same plane of immortality. In truth, it's more like an edit of the Cold Lake aesthetics which takes into consideration so much of the critique of that album into an account and then executes with a far more appealing savvy. Gone are the incredibly cheesy lyrics of a \"Dance Sleazy\" or \"Little Velvet\", replaced with the more apocryphal rantings of their earlier 80s fare; yet there's only a thin line which separates the pair musically. That said, Vanity/Nemesis is a vast improvement, a cognizant rebuttal to the faux pas of its predecessor that holds up a lot more strongly through the ensuing decades. Not so good that I feel often compelled to revisit it, but engaging enough to break out once in a blue moon. Ironic, then, that it would be the last 'official' record before the shit hit the fan...\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt's confusing how a band can be scaling towards the summit of its creative expression one year and then diving off a cliff the next, but in the case of the much maligned Cold Lake, that is exactly what transpired. I purchased the album when it was released in stores, with zero foreknowledge of its stylistic deviation from Into the Pandemonium, no advance screen of the \"Cherry Orchards\" video. About the only hint I had that the mighty had possibly fallen would have been the purple cover art, removal of the classic Celtic Frost logo and replacement with some iconic, chrome and cherry tinted logo against a nebulous purple haze. But frankly, this was nothing really unusual for the time. Saxon's Destiny, Van Halen's earlier output and a host of other metal and hard rock recordings used such stripped down, emblematic images to represent themselves, so it wasn't a deal breaker.\n\nHowever, I could never have expected what came next: the enormously disappointing paradigm shift in the band's songwriting, a complete antithesis to the exotic wizardry that defined Into the Pandemonium or the leaden crushing of To Mega Therion. Celtic Frost had more or less 'gone glam', its creator surrounded by a host of new (and old) musicians and perhaps too accommodating to their desires and ideas. Tom G. Warrior has since condemned this record, citing that its faults were a result of the new four piece band dynamic and his desire to let loose and have a little fun, letting guitarist Oliver Amberg (who played briefly in Hellhammer) write a chunk of the material. That after a disappointing US tour and a perhaps too hasty decision to end the band, he was only too thrilled to experience its swift resurrection and share its fate with eager band mates. But I do have to wonder, as the heart and soul of this band, if part of the change in style was due to some inner fascination the man had with glam metal or commercial hard rock...I mean, whatever the excuse, he still signed his name to it, played on the record and appeared in the video.\n\nThere were a lot of fans who crossed over between the popular MTV garbage and the heavier speed/thrash, one dominating the mainstream, the other the underground. Both had their presence in high schools, colleges, clubs and radio playlists everywhere. But it's hard to qualify Cold Lake as a pure transformation into 'glam metal', because it didn't sound a hell of a lot like what you were hearing out of the shitty party rock bands like Poison or Warrant. This is more like 'pseudo glam'. There is still an ugly, chugging monstrosity lurking somewhere under the eaves of this record, only it'd been obfuscated beneath the facade of a bunch of hair sprayed Euro-rockers who seemed more into racing Aston Martins through Alpine speedways with a martini in one hand and the lingerie of some hair sprayed groupie slut in the other, than continuing to excel and expand the boundaries of their genre like the album's predecessor. I must admit, my very first thoughts upon listening through this album were that the band was being ironic, 'trolling' the audience with some avant-garde mockery of a scene they all loathed, thinking so far outside of the box that they placed themselves back INSIDE the box.\n\nAs history reveals, though, this was clearly not what was happening. Now, before I proceed any further, let's talk about 'image'. The fact that the band were dowsing themselves in ozone depletion or dressed in tight fitting, frilly or fancy clothes was not necessarily a huge concern of mine. I get the whole 'glam' thing, as much as I rebelled against it through high school and still sneer at it to this day, it's always been a park of the rock world. Boys like to play dress up just as girls do, and while some took and still take it to broad extremes (Japan's 'visual kei'), but for many in the Sunset Strip or traditional European metal scenes, it was just how things were done, an acceptable practice in the 80s by the raving legions of drooling fangirls and by extension, all the dudes who wanted to get in their pants. For me to write off Celtic Frost's momentary lapse into vanity as a critical fumble would be hypocritical while simultaneously ignoring the dolly wardrobes of Fifth Angel, or W.A.S.P., whose dress codes were absolutely ridiculous (i.e. retarded) and almost never seem to draw ire for it; or the many other bands who felt such a superficial allure when their music and lyrics were drawn from a deeper well.\n\nSo if Celtic Frost wanted to look like a mirror image of Hanoi Rocks, so what? The real issue for me is how this image and attitude also permeated the musical content. While Into the Pandemonium was no stranger to intricate seductions through the sensual female vocals or lyrical prose, the shallower chorus sequences to \"Dance Sleazy\", \"Juices Like Wine\" or \"Tease Me\" are unquestionably lame. You're still getting a lot of mystical, oblique imagery here in lines like 'obsessed with lies, in arms of sleep' or 'masking fears of silent decline', redolent of what you might read on the prior record, but the context in which they appear feels cheesy and dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. What's worse, Tom's voice sounds like a transvestite frog with a severe hernia. We'd heard his Gothic whining in the past, and it suited the music pretty well for several of the cuts off Pandemonium, but here it becomes almost unbearable when he hocks a loogie of 'check this out' during the first riff of \"Seduce Me Tonight\", or erupts into the plaintive whimpering of the chorus to \"Juices Like Wine\" or \"Little Velvet\", the latter of which is the second most painful point to experience on the whole album.\n\nThe first, of course, is the horrendous hip hop intro \"Human\". I was more than willing to excuse the amateurish proto-industrial beats of \"One in Their Pride\" from Into the Pandemonium, because it was an interesting choice in subject matter and experimentation. Here, though, such 'open mindedness' doesn't seem even remotely like a good idea, nor does it match the tone of the remaining record, and so Cold Lake is automatically off to a terrible start. Another questionable decision was to leave in the snippets of mic chatter after the band did their takes at the ends of many of the tracks. I realize they were trying to seem all lighthearted, organic and raw, but they make the songs even more difficult to approach with any semblance of seriousness. I must also point out that there are a few riffs here which seem to have been lazily or unconsciously retread through the album: the opening guitar in \"Blood on Kisses\" sounds quite a lot like \"Seduce Me Tonight\", and the groove in \"Little Velvet\" sounds similar to the verse riffing in \"Cherry Orchards\".\n\nYet, despite its many flaws and disappointments, the sense of utter revulsion and betrayal that the album evokes in me as in many others, I cannot entirely write it off, and never have. The reason being that, for what its worth (and that's not a lot), I generally find myself nodding along to various of the riffs, digging some of the guitar progressions. In fact, had the goal of Warrior and his new crew been solely to write a raw, back to basics Celtic Frost record, I don't think it would have received such negative blowback. Tracks like \"Cherry Orchids\", with its straight and airy guitars, pumping bass, male/female vocal interchange, or \"Petty Obsession\", bristling with memorable mutes and chords in an admittedly charismatic flow, would have been more than acceptable if not for Warrior's sobbing timbre. \"Downtown Hanoi\" and \"Roses Without Thorns\" have some muscular, semi-memorable riffs as well, the latter with a cute and bluesy curve to it around 1:10. \"(Once) They Were Eagles\" and \"Juices Like Wine\" have some solid, inherent melodies in their chords which wouldn't have been out of place for a band like Queensryche or King Diamond.\n\nThat's a pretty good chunk of the album, that, handled differently, might have salvaged some dignity. Granted, even if this were recorded with a more modern Monotheist production, Tom growling throughout and far heavier drumming, it still wouldn't be as interesting as the two previous albums, but I certainly feel there's enough to the song structures that they're not a total waste, and thus I've never held this album so low as a lot of those staggering disappointments of the 90s that were foisted upon us by more popular acts. I hold Cold Lake in higher regard than, say, Load or Diabolus in Musica, The Least Successful Human Cannonball or Stomp 442, but that's not saying a lot, since these are essentially feces given musical form, so bad they stink across the decades. But then, it's not like Cold Lake is a whiff of fresh breath, either, and many of the criticisms leveled at it are all too glaring with veracity.\n\nFrom a studio standpoint, one might argue that Tony Platt's production job did the material little enough service. Quite an experienced engineer, his experience lay in a lot of NWOBHM or hard rock albums from AC/DC, Samson, Trust, Krokus, Mot\u00f6rhead and so forth, so it's not an inappropriate terrible match, but the vocals and leads feel a bit on the loud side, and though I don't have a personal problem with the airiness created through the reverb (a common trait in the 80s), it doesn't make for the most potent rhythm guitar tone which might have contributed to overall heaviness. Jan Nemec's work on Into the Pandemonium was far more impressive and refined. Stephen Priestly had previously appeared on the Morbid Tales EP, but his drumming here is little more than standard hard rock fare circa Bobby Blotzer, Tommy Lee, etc. The leads are relatively interesting, messy and wailing, yet well defined enough to shift favorably alongside the supporting rhythms. There's not a lot wrong with Michelle Villanueva's sultry guest vocals, but in the Cold Lake context (\"Cherry Orchards\", \"Little Velvet\") they come off almost as corny as Warrior himself.\n\nIn summation, this is not an album I feel so strongly against that I'll curse it to the end of my existence. Of the many thousands of metal recordings I've experienced through my years, there are a good number I find more irritating and outright offensive. But at best, the songwriting is weak and misguided, a textbook case of what NOT to do when your band is an established cult favorite, regardless of how much you're seeking acceptance after a perceived slump in momentum. What were they thinking? That their underground audience was going to somehow forget who they were, or what they represented for extreme metal? That somehow the larger glam audience was going to accept their dirty, heavier riffing and herniated toad eroticism in lieu of \"Talk Dirty to Me\", \"Smokin' in the Boys Room\" or \"Living on a Prayer\"? It boggles the mind, but more regrettably, it's a tragedy that some decent riffs were thrown to the wolves, sentenced to drown, down with the rest of the ship. I wish I had more to say in its favor, as I don't hate it down to the guts like so many others, but there's just no happy ending for Cold Lake, and there never will be.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nInto the Pandemonium is not my favorite Celtic Frost production, but it's by far their most eclectic and creative, as evidenced by the wide array of styles implemented through its course. It's not at all dismissive of the slight intervals of evolution which led to its being, but if we were to compare any two of the Swiss legends' releases side to side, it would represent the largest solitary gulf. I realize there are those who would argue that its glam infested successor, Cold Lake was their biggest deviation, but I've never thought of that as more or less than a foundation of traditional Frost grooves and riffs drowned in an unfortunate, limp wristed whining and and unwelcome change in the band's image. Into the Pandemonium, on the other hand, feels as if the trio had gone on some worldwide vacation for two years, smoked from a variety of pipes and hookahs over numerous continents, and then returned by elephant back to their native Zurich.\n\nThis was a brave album, born almost entirely of exotic, worldly compulsion and a clear desire to bend the boundaries of possibility for not only Celtic Frost alone, but the entire metal genre. There were a lot of other bands evolving and enriching their sound at this time in both the US and Europe, but where an act like Running Wild, King Diamond or Savatage was centered on shaping and refining itself in the familiar environs of its earlier albums, the Swiss trio were reaching for the stars, consuming entire outside genres of music and then forging them into an impressive armor of eccentricity. To that effect, I can certainly understand the hesitation or outright resistance some felt towards the idiosyncratic gravity of Into the Pandemonium, but it's not one I can in any good conscience share. Growth and innovation are not mandatory traits in my enjoyment of a metal recording, but if I were to ply through a database of all time favorites it would prove a component of the vast majority. Music (and by extension, much of reality) is a kinetic voice. Not static. One can expand with its near endless variations, or contract from it and seek shelter beneath its prehistoric statuary. Celtic Frost chose the former, and so did I.\n\nOf course, one of the beauties of this record is that they've done so without abandoning the backbone of their earlier works. Much of Into the Pandemonium is still comprised of the signature, sludgy thrashing rhythms they are known for circa Morbid Tales, only polished up a bit to match the hazy mystique of their neighbors. \"Inner Sanctum\", one of the most substantial 5+ minute tracks on the album is cast in the same vein as much of To Mega Therion, hook after hook of primal, pummeling goodness with Tom's traditional, constipated vocal barking. There is some slight increase of complexity from, say, a \"Jewel Throne\" in the sheer variety of riffs and the drumming, but it's not likely to offend expectations for further, mosh ready fare. \"Babylon Fell\" would have fit in perfectly with the prior album, it's huge and unforgettable palm muted grooves some of the heaviest in the Frost lexicon. Even the symphonic ingredients are not necessarily news. The beautiful \"Oriental Masquerade\" has a similar texture to the \"Innocence and Wrath\" intro, with horns, timpanis and sluggish riffing redolent of a Japanese giant monster movie from decades past...only the violins are truly top shelf here.\n\nAs much as I enjoy such songs, however, I can't help but drift towards the more extrinsic pieces that mottle the playlist. \"Tristesses de la Lune\" is perhaps the most ambitious track they've ever summoned forth, a sweeping and gorgeous string orchestration with a beautiful female guest spot in French, worthy of some of the better European composers of past centuries. The lyrics are eloquent, and the imagery evoked through the performance is like something you'd probably rent a suit for to witness at an opera hall. The Anglicized metallic version \"Sorrows of the Moon\", available on most of the CD releases, is less appealing, perhaps, but there's no doubt it was easier to pull off live and justifies inclusion. \"I Won't Dance (The Elders Orient)\" is another total standout here, a leaden rocker upon which Tom asserts a cleaner, passionate Gothic tone to his verses, returning to his usual barking temperament for the pre-chorus and chorus on which he's backed up by a 'soul' style female voice. Motown meets metallic, Mesopotamian antiquity.\n\nI would also point out \"Mesmerized\", which has a similar Warrior vocal treatment and a glint of lush acoustics threaded through the verse, and a somber melodic passage through the bridge that inspire at least two dozen Paradise Lost tunes. Or \"Rex Irae (Requiem)\" which is this exquisite, 6 minute Gothic doom operetta with more of Mark's beloved timpani strikes and yet another lovely intrusion of strings. The vocal interplay between Tom and the female opera strain is impressive, especially where he's backed up by a blaring horn note, but there's also a more intricate, percussive thrashing in there with some driving, double bass kicks and a sequence of narrative exchange which is stunningly effective. With ease one of the most intricate tunes in all of the band's litany, passing beyond the realm of mere music to that of sensory experience as the listener's imagination drifts through ancient empires, passions and ritual incense. I DARE one of this album's detractors to create something so immortal and compelling.\n\nBut then, of course, the Swiss go even further out on a limb here, with the inclusion of the proto industrial track \"One in Their Pride\". This is not the greatest cut on the album, In fact it's one of the few exceptions to its near flawless musical interior, but nonetheless it was a fascinating departure for the band, a paean to the first man on the moon (Neil Armstrong) and a testament to human achievement. Musically, though, it's completely different for Celtic Frost. Primitive electro kicks reminiscent of some missing link between Kraftwerk and early Ministry (or Nitzer Ebb). Wailing, atonal strings and myriad speech samples abound in its swirling vacuum, to the point that it seems to conjure the image of some satellite spinning off beyond the earth's atmospheric envelope. Even stranger, perhaps, was the decision to open the album with a cover of the Wall of Voodoo's \"Mexican Radio\". Don't get me wrong, the LA New Wavers' hit is in good hands here, just given the Frost 'treatment' with heavier guitars and angrier, gruff vocals in between the backing shouts of the chorus, but, really...who woulda thunk it?\n\nInto the Pandemonium trumps expectations at nearly every turn, but its decisions never feel rash or impulsive, no matter how unusual. Once again, as upon To Mega Therion, I felt that Warrior was trying to train his audience in the act of a wider, aesthetic appreciation. Take a few minutes to cross-reference the lyrics here with almost anything else in the metal spectrum in the mid 80s and you'll discover just how poetic and eloquent they are, how out of place amidst the usual volley of machine gun testosterone. These aren't mere hymns to nuclear war and TV Evangelists, but deeper reflections upon mortality, nature and the fate of archaic civilizations. Of course, as in \"Babylon Fell\", these are easy enough to relate to current events, but the prose is so simple and classy that it feels as fresh today as on its original release. What's more, the partial use of the \"Hell\" scene from Hieronymus Boschs's early 16th century triptych The Garden of Earthly Lights is perfect, its colors, structures and figures so immaculately in sync with the atmosphere of the songs that you wonder if they were written while staring at it...\n\nAll of these ingredients add up to what I'd dub the last of the 'essential Frost' recordings. Not that later albums like Vanity/Nemesis or Monotheist lack their charms, but they're nowhere near as imaginative and ageless as most of this content. \"One In Their Pride\" doesn't hold up for me in terms of quality so much as an example of experimentation gone awry, and the cover of \"Mexican Radio\" is naturally not so intriguing as the originals, but otherwise this album should be remembered as nothing less than an anomaly. A phenomenon whose alluring lyrical imagery, intricate variation and balanced production ensure that it survives as one of the finest examples of the avant-garde to arrive in heavy rock since the proggish embellishments of the 70s. Mood and inspiration, songwriting and distinction. This lacks none of it. Feast your ears.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nTragic Serenades was another of those lovely excesses of the 80s which had very little authentic justification for existence other than its commercial advantages. All three of the tracks here had already been released (\"Jewel Throne\" and \"The Usurper\" through To Mega Therion; \"Return to the Eve\" through the Morbid Tales EP), but Tom G. Warrior claims to have wanted to ramp up the production on a number of the tunes and incorporate Martin Ain's bass lines as a replacement for those Dominic Steiner recorded on the full-length. Makes sense, but then, why not just re-record the whole thing? Were the album versions of \"Jewel Throne\" and \"The Usurper\" such a legitimate cause for concern? I rather enjoyed them, and to be honest, I don't find these to be much improved...\n\nBut hey, it's got a Celtic Frost logo on it. Obscure, minimal, and pretty fascinating cover image. The market for this band was still quite young, and by '86 a lot of folks had yet to hear them, but thrash and speed metal were starting to blow up thanks to bands like Metallica, Anthrax and Slayer. So it would not have surprised me that Tragic Serenades was a first introduction for a number of their flock, and in fact experienced this first hand with a friend who called me over to listen to the 'new' Frost tape, only to then rush home and dub him the entire To Mega Therion since it was obvious that he wasn't getting the 'whole picture' (the selection here lacks some of the important, grandiose, atmospheric French horn stuff on the LP). The fact is, a ton of EPs and singles like this one, some with only the most minor of distinctions and studio tweaks, were unleashed upon a fan base that presumably would buy them for collection purposes or to shell out a few more dollars to their favorite labels and artists. A practice I didn't have a huge problem with at the time, but then...there's a reason why Eyes of Horror retains its value and Tragic Serenades does not.\n\nTo be fair, the production here of the album cuts seems even more raw and potent than it was before, and Celtic Frost at their angriest to its day. Ain's bass lines don't differ much in tone, but they feel more spacious and atmospheric and lend themselves just as well to the music as Steiner's. I like his slides and aggression in \"Jewel Throne\", and if I'm not mistaken it seems a bit more distorted in general than on the album. \"The Usurper\" comes off a fraction more groovy than the prior incarnation, but I don't really notice a gulf in quality between the two versions due to the bass or enhanced mix. The last track, an alternate studio take on \"Return to the Eve\" was included to show a lighter hearted side of the band, so you get a lot of hoarser spit and 'hngggs' from Warrior, and Reed St. Mark also adds some vocals with an even gruffer tone that...to be truthful...I wouldn't have minded on a lot more of their early tunes. That said, this incarnation of \"Return...\" seems mildly goofy in retrospect...\n\nBut the fact that it was also included on the re-release of To Mega Therion, and in fact, this whole EP has been retroactively added to subsequent issues of the album, renders it even more obsolete than it was when it first came out. Tragic Serenades is certainly the sort of product that tugs at the heartstrings of a good number of fans, and I can admire its nostalgic appeal, but I just don't see any ultimate purpose for it when I've already got Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion. I never lost any sleep thinking to myself 'hrm, what if Martin Eric Ain had re-recorded the bass parts for these tracks'. Not to downplay the guy's importance in the band's legacy (for better AND worse, down the road) but the full-length wasn't broken, and didn't need fixing. For me, this feels like thinly veiled contractual filler. And the 11 and a half minutes of redundancy and taking the piss here do nothing except occupy that Graveyard of Dusty Cassettes that I've no reason to return to...\n\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIf Celtic Frost's early EPs represented a dark dungeon of forsaken pleasures, then To Mega Therion must be the opulent obsidian stronghold which covers it; the bastion of utter darkness from which its perverse overlord metes his reign upon the surrounding realms. Heavier, more consistent and more riff laden than either of its terse predecessors, it's essentially the pinnacle of creation for one of the most innovative metal acts of the 90s, ushering in an entirely new domain of exotic atmospheres and hinting at myriad possibilities for further exploration. We know in retrospect that several of its future fluctuations would succeed more than others, but To Mega Therion added a fresh, coherent sheen of midnight to not only the band's own morbid legacy, but to extreme metal in general. An opaque veil that has yet to be lifted.\n\nBeyond this, To Mega Therion is an album I also hold dear due to its influence upon my own development on my second (and later primary) instrument, the guitar. Officially, I was studying under an instructor who thankfully customized his lessons towards my taste through a lot of hard rock tunes (Dokken, Scorpions etc), and a brief conceit to teach me \"Jump in the Fire\"; but in the company of my 13 year old thoughts, with an old Peavey amp in the basement and a mutant Kramer Striker, I was plugging away to the inspiration of Celtic Frost, among a few others. The slower chugging and expressive but simple power chord patterns used in Tom G. Warrior's composition provided the perfect initiation to novice thrashing. Simple to ascertain and execute with standard tuning, and heavier than most terrestrial planets, To Mega Therion was an infallible seduction to a darker musical sphere, and I can't be alone in thinking this: countless thrash, heavy, doom, black and death metal bands over the course of decades would use its content as an aesthetic blueprint for their varied careers.\n\nStylistically, the lion's share of the material written for the full-length does not deviate greatly from Morbid Tales and Emperor's Return. Or for that matter, Hellhammer. The focus is far greater on slower, crushing numbers in the vein of \"Procreation (of the Wicked)\", \"Return to the Eve\" and such than the hardcore-infused punk riffing prevalent on several of the EP tracks, but you can still clearly here the roots from which the Swiss legends sprung, and many of the chord patterns found on cuts like \"Jewel Throne\", \"Eternal Summer\" and \"Dawn of Megiddo\" clearly reflect the same balance of punctilious, primal composition with eloquent lyrical despair. Celtic Frost was always been a band aware of its technical boundaries, as far as musical ability. They weren't forcing the borders of the genre so much as their German and Bay Area contemporaries, but they took what they had and made it work, conjuring aggression through the atmosphere that the thick picking implied, to compensate for this general lack of speed...\n\nWhat this album might lack in machine gun drumming and complex string wizardry, it more than makes up for in its several brilliant decisions to incorporate orchestration via the use of a French horn (Wolf Bender), shrill operatic female vocals (Claudia-Maria Mokri) and Reed St. Mark banging on a timpani in addition to his normal kit. The intro piece, \"Innocence and Wrath\" feels like a European answer to the classic Godzilla theme, and it's no accident: the piece instantly sets a mood for the remainder of the track list, and when the general motif returns in \"Dawn of Megiddo\", or culminates in the operatic chorus to \"Necromantical Screams\", the whole of To Mega Therion is bound together in a pervasive, drowning and depressive atmosphere that to its day was incredibly novel and immediately unforgettable. I can't say that I love all of the sparse female shrieks throughout the album. They often grate a fraction more than intended. But how many Gothic, doom and black metal bands today rely so heavily this technique in their 'beauty and the beast' interplay?\n\nDespite its deathly demeanor, which arguably peaks in the doomed gait of \"Dawn of Megiddo\", To Mega Therion is not an album lacking in puerile, rampant energy. Tracks like \"Jewel Throne\" and \"Fainted Eyes\" are rife with primordial, thrashing energy and intense grooves anchored by St. Mark's muscular throughput. I'm not trying to advocate for the jock mosh sect, which has transformed through the decades from an innocent and mutual release of testosterone to alpha male preening, but if you can't sway your fists (or at least your head) to the riff set of \"Jewel Throne\", it's likely you just hate thrash metal. Walk away, man. Just walk away. To boot, this is one of the tracks which accelerates itself, culminating in some of the punk pacing of their earlier releases. \"Circle of the Tyrants\" was also drafted to this album from the Emperor's Return EP, and while I have maintained a slight preference towards the original, the brighter, raw treatment here fits well into its neighbors. Another example of how the album can shelf its weighty Gothic atmosphere to flex some brute strength at the audience. Yet another: Dominic Steiner's loud bass chords during \"Necromantical Screams\".\n\nTom's vocals are superb here, and arguably the best they've ever felt on any of the full-lengths. Dark, tense, and cumbersome, his accent and timbre barking out the dark prose like the noblest of savages. An exception might be the bonus studio jam \"Return of the Eve\", on which the vocals are so heavily effected that they can feel as silly as they are charming, but this was not a core component of the original album and thus easily brushed off. What's more, the lyrics retain the serious nature of the earlier works. Slayer was singing about Satan and psycho killers, Venom about Satan and cocaine, Destruction about Satan and the meat packing industry, but there was something so ominous, grandiose and mature about Celtic Frost's paeans to avarice, pride, and the lessons inherent in the occult and mythology. The sequential, conceptual bindings of \"The Usurper\", \"Jewel Throne\" are also interesting. Once again, a huge source of inspiration, this time for tens of thousands of black metal bands to follow (notably Emperor and the earlier Darkthrone canon).\n\nAll this aside, I must admit that I have never found The Mega Therion to be the most flawless of jewels. A huge part of this is that I don't really care for the instrumental \"Tears in a Prophet's Dream\", an electro/ritual/ambient track which feels even less coherent than \"Danse Macabre\" on the Morbid Tales EP. It's not that I don't appreciate Celtic Frost's desire to experiment, but the random bass chortling, percussion and goofy wails here have always conspired to take me straight out of the experience. It seems like they threw it together and placed it on the album just because 'they could' rather than to pursue an honest artistic abstraction from the metal surroundings. Thankfully, the track that follows \"Necromantical Screams\" is so damned good, or \"Tears...\" would seem even more of a souring anticlimax. Otherwise, a few of the shrill vocals and the fact that \"Circle of the Tyrants\" feels mildly redundant being here would be the only nitpicks I could launch against this timeless behemoth, and for the latter...I will begrudgingly admit that, as one of their best songs, it belonged on a full-length so more could hear it.\n\nCoverage of this staggering monstrosity could never be complete without a nod to the choice in cover art. Though Geiger's Satan I had been originally conceived in the 70s, it was the perfect match for Frost's ungodly lyrical explorations. The cynical, sacrilege of its imagery would prove iconic to generations of metal fans, atheists, occultists, and it was also nice of Warrior to 'keep it in the family' (aka country) by collaborating with the Swiss surrealist. What's more, it to me represents that Celtic Frost wanted to hint at a wider range of classicism and art beyond the metal spectrum, almost as if they were prompting the audience to smarten up, expand ourselves and look further into other fields of depth and vision (a tactic they'd repeat with the use of the Hieronymous Bosch painting for Into the Pandemonium). I'm sure for many of us, it worked. By extension, so does the album. As grim an enlightenment as nearly anything that came out of this formative, important period in aural extremes, and in my opinion, one of the best Swiss works in the entire genre (excepting only Coroner's 1988-89 masterworks and Samael's underrated Passage, all of which are of course either related to or directly inspired by this very band).\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nSnakes and ladies. When you get right down to it, they're the building block of civilizations. Morals. Faiths, or at least one faith. We might not all have lives blessed with the same caliber of coiled demons and chained, moppy headed (or bald) punk harlots who confront us from the cover of Celtic Frost's second EP, Emperor's Return, but I can't have been the only young teenager to have felt a strange seduction at the sight. Fortunately, this packs more than a mere penis pump, but a notable stride forward in the quality and style that were introduced through Hellhammer's Apocalyptic Raids and its direct precursor, the 1984 release Morbid Tales. Sharpened, polished, call it what you will, but Emperor's Return is responsible for at least one of the best cuts in this Swiss band's repertoire, and one of the grooviest, darkest hymns in all of 80s thrash.\n\nPerhaps the writing here represents one of the most marginal evolutions in the Tom G. Warrior canon, for the riffing structure is not a far cry from previous tracks like \"Return to the Eve\" or \"Procreation (Of the Wicked)\". I found the production on these five tunes to sound less ruddy, though that strangely grisly and fulfilling guitar tone remains intact. Simple and effective chord sequences which rarely deviate from the band's prior curriculum, but they seem to bear a bolder sense of darkness, an inescapable and suffocating sense of being stuffed into a crypt where the dead dance by day and necromantic rituals and forsaken eros are performed by the few traces of moonlight that filter through the stone cracks of the ceiling. What I'm trying to express in such crowded and colorful hues is that Emperor's Return rocks: pretty much from the first notes of \"Dethroned Emperor\" to the faster paced speed/dirt of \"Visual Aggression\", you are getting your ass kicked.\n\n\"Circle of the Tyrants\" is my favorite of this lot, and arguably the band's career highlight, fully cognizant of the punk and hardcore aesthetics that informed Frost's roots, with a percussive use of chorus to split the verses, and some of their most immense grooves, like the dark and potent riff that erupts about 1:40 into the tune. As usual, Tom G. Warrior places just the right amount of echo on his vocals so he seems to be drifting into your ears from the dust of decay, and there are also some garbled pitch shifted incantations here which add nicely to the context. \"Morbid Tales\" features a prominent, thudding bass courtesy of Martin Eric Ain, and another classic, unforgettable heavy palm mute in the verse riff, with some of Warrior's unmistakable rock star swagger in the 'ows' and 'yeahs' found therein. Reed St. Mark offers a more muscular double bass in the bridge of the track, and overall I'd consider the drums more consistent and rock solid than those of Morbid Tales, and Celtic Frost proves yet again why they're so influential upon the decades of extreme metal to follow.\n\nThe latter tracks on the EP like \"Suicidal Winds\" and \"Visual Aggression\" have always held a slightly less important place in my memory than the first three, though they've also got a more grimy interface and rely on some of the faster riffing that I wasn't always so thrilled with on the first EP. In a way, the grooves that often manifest in Frost tunes would not be so effective without a change up from this almost pure dirtcore momentum (the NY band Sheer Terror would later channel this into excellence on their classic LP Just Can't Hate Enough), but I just never found the note sequences to be so enduring. That said, both of the tunes are admittedly consistent in disposition to the forerunners, and they certainly don't break the 21 minutes of bludgeoning, grooving and driving momentum.\n\nHands down, Emperor's Return is the best of Celtic Frost's non full-length fare (unless you're experiencing it in conjunction with the first EP on the CD reissue), and the ramp up towards the band's most brilliant album. Normally it might lose a little luster in the fact that \"Circle of the Tyrants\" would also appear on To Mega Therion, but I honestly prefer this less atmospheric version for its earthly charms, and alongside \"Dethroned Emperor\" and \"Morbid Tales\" it belongs on any highlight reel of their stronger work. I also love the cover art, the immortal lyrics (\"are you morbid?\"), and the truly oblique atmosphere the band is able to evoke through the riffing and bare minimum of other effects: it feels tangibly, invariably evil, like the musings of a mummified despot who longs to slake his thirst on the sanguine essence of the world once more. Whether you've got an original tape or LP or picture disc or you're loving it up alongside its older sibling, it belongs wherever there is good taste. Blood and concubines optional.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nA legend like Celtic Frost could not be overlooked when after 14 long years they release an album, and what an album. Celtic Frost is widely known as a major influence for many black metal, death metal and thrash metal bands. Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion are considered classics of the early black metal movement while Into the Pandemonium and Cold Lake venture into industrial, avant-garde metal and the other one into hard rock. Vanity/Nemesis was just a reheated porridge, trying to go back to their original style. As a result, the band did not last for long, disbanding after releasing a best off.\n\nThe early 2000s brought the band back from the ashes. But what could I expect from Celtic Frost back then? I have to admit that the band surely took it's time in preparing to release this album. After all, we speak about 6 years since their re-union until Monotheist was available in stores. I remember that I went back and had a listen to their older records, out of nostalgia mostly. I placed a bet saying that the proper re-union gift would be to turn back to their roots and record a follow up for To Mega Therion but instead I received something totally unexpected and surprising, the least to say.\n\nI would not exaggerate in saying that Monotheist was by far the best album released in 2006, this coming from a band that hasn't released nor played anything for almost 14 years! While Tom G. Warrior activated in an industrial project called Apollyon Sun, the other members were completely out of the scene until the re-union. I was surprised to see the quality of this release. To be more precise, not only that the sound quality was great, but the mixture of elements, genres, influences and atmosphere were absolutely stunning.\n\nI could describe Monotheist as the peak of glory of Celtic Frost, providing a primitive sound which could be heard on the old Hellhammer songs (Apocalyptic Raids) and combining this with Gothic and doom metal elements. Closely listening this record I even managed to identify groove elements specific in songs such as Ain Elohim or the first track of this record, Progeny. It is also pretty hard to label this record as black metal. Though it has some elements of it, the fact that the tempo was slowed down to allow a more atmospheric and somber sound is also quite noticeable.\n\nA Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh is by far one of the best tracks this album could give, no wonder that this song was selected for having a music video. This album featured female vocals done by Lisa Middelhauve (ex. Xandria) in the song Drown in Ashes. Simone Vollenweider contributed with her vocals in songs such as Temple of Depression, Incantation Against and Obscured (a song which has many similarities with Drown in Ashes). The rawest song of this album is Temple of Depression which, in my opinion, is the closest to the black metal roots specific for Hellhammer or old Celtic Frost records.\n\nMonotheist stands as the most surprising 2006 record and also as one of the best material Celtic Frost ever released. For doom metal fans, this record is a must while for older fans it might be a sort of surprise, depends on their preferences if the surprise is either positive or negative. For a band that has been inactive for 14 years, I think that Monotheist is a great record which clearly signifies Celtic Frost's revival. If these arguments do not impress you, then at least give it a listen for Celtic Frost's sake a band which is noted as a major influence for a great number of metal bands.\n",
        "\nWhat I love most about the retrospective analysis of the metal music from my youth, that which I've matured alongside for decades now, is just how fascinating and divergent its evolution seems in the rear view mirror. How different nations and scenes contributed to parallel growth, structurally and lyrically. How particular releases launched a thousand ships like the fabled Helen of Troy, while others could not inspire disembarkation from even the scantest of flotilla. Funny then, that even among all of these coordinated fronts of competitive and emulous transformation, Swiss godfathers Celtic Frost stands as more or less an anomaly, an anthropological crossroads between the cultures of thrash metal, doom, hardcore punk, and the black and death metal scenes which had yet to fully embody their own identities.\n\nIt would be hard to take an accurate count of how many recordings have been directly inspired by Morbid Tales, because we're at a stage now where even its own aesthetic offspring are now at legendary status. Darkthrone is the perfect example. Both their death metal debut Soulside Journey and seminal black metal mutation Ablaze in the Norther Sky were openly, enormously inspired by Tom G. Warrior and crew, in atmosphere, attitude AND actualized riff structure; and I could name hundreds of shameless knockoffs of that enduring Norse outfit. Granted, Celtic Frost (and its prior incarnation Hellhammer) were not themselves without some precedent. Punk and hardcore music had by this point arrived and spawned a number of aggressive legends of their own (Discharge's Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing among them), while a not insignificant fraction of this band's relentlessness and filth might be attributed to UK demons Venom and Mot\u00f6rhead; lyrically the former and musically the pair. Tendrils of descent from the crushing pathos of 70s Sabbath are undeniable.\n\nEven inclusive of these considerations, though, Morbid Tails is a distinct landmark on a trail of carnage that stems from the dawn of musical extremity to the ongoing struggle for attaining that next 'level' of aggression. By comparison to faster, more lethal contemporaries of the period like Bathory's self-titled debut, Slayer's Show No Mercy or Destruction's Sentence of Death, the material here often lacks finesse or the same knack for riffing complexity. Celtic Frost had cleaned itself up from Hellhammer, and the production values are noticeably more accessible and professional than the Apocalyptic Raids EP from the same year. That's not necessarily a positive, and I might personally prefer the earlier archetype to their first two releases under the new identity, but it makes sense for a band whose intent was growth alongside the emergent and diversified European underground of extreme metal. These days it's a badge of honor in certain scenes to produce the most amateur, afflicted and unwashed material possible, but by the mid 80s, that practice generally manifest as a symptom of having little to no budget.\n\nHowever, fret not, heralds of grime, because Morbid Tales still retains the ruddy riffing texture and dynamic sensibility of its predecessors. Blazing, punk guitar passages are interspersed with slower palm muted hardcore/thrash sequences, the latter just as worthy of the primordial mosh pits as what the Stormtroopers of Death would soon start to build overseas. Of the five metal tracks on the EP (excluding \"Danse Macabre\"), there is a fairly even distribution of fast and slow material. \"Into the Crypts of Rays\", \"Visions of Mortality\" and \"Nocturnal Fear\" all feature rapt excursions into velocity, while \"Procreation (Of the Wicked)\" and \"Return to the Eve\" adhere to a plodding, crushing consistency which feels incredibly heavy despite the clarity and polish of the guitar tone. Martin Ain's low end and Stephen Priestly's drumming might not seem extravagant, but they add to the bruised ugliness of the music, in particular the syrup-thick bass which often competes with the guitar for attention, even if the notation runs a similar course.\n\nI would like to spend some time discussing the signature components and techniques that these Swiss legends brought to the table. First and foremost, the corpulent and molten 'grooves' bear some mentioning. A strong example would be the opening for \"Procreation (of the Wicked)\", with its slosh of chords against strong palm muted chugging that is pretty much the default for how thousands of bands in various genres build a riff even today. Prior to this, I think only Sabbath could crush so hard (\"Symptoms of the Universe\", etc). But Celtic Frost also evolved a rare characteristic of opening and closing off certain measures with a simple, bended note that oozed torment while giving a false sense of 'incompletion' to the overall riff, a technique that progeny like Darkthrone would recycle for decades. They also stuck to a lot of very basic ascending and descending patterns or chords that helped solidify the grooves without scattering themselves over the fret board, like the incredible mosh riff in the lead-bridge of \"Return to the Eve\".\n\nMost importantly, though, are the vocals of Tom G. Warrior, which sound like a man choking on crud while clearing his lungs, or some constipated, drunken drifter emerging from a bar in Zurich to take a squat in a dank alley of refuse. With the right amount of echo or reverb here, his bark sounds incredibly oblique, evil and memorable, and the guy's 'hoos' and 'has' and 'ooos' are just legendary, a clear remnant of his showmanlike, hard rock forebears. Surely there's a bit of Cronos and Lemmy in the 'spirit' of his delivery, but his thick accent ensures a unique quality that, to its day, I know I hadn't experienced. The lyrics are also pretty fucking impressive, paeans to the contrasted knight/serial killer Gilles de Rais (\"Into the Crypts of Rays\"), ritual magic (\"Visions of Mortality\"), the succession of original sin from the Old Testament (\"Procreation of the Wicked\"), the dreamstate (\"Return to the Eve\"), and even Lovecraft's Mythos (\"Nocturnal Fear\"). A pretty eclectic array of dark subjects delivered through thoughtful, image-thick prose that was well ahead of many of the band's metal contemporaries (internationally).\n\nDespite all of its myriad qualities, and the many distinctions I've described herein, I will admit that Morbid Tales is not quite deserving of a bust upon the pedestal of perfection that others might claim. Its primal transgressions I take no issue with: not the simplicity of the songwriting structures, nor the predictable flow of the riffing. But, for example, I don't like the lead guitars, which are fleeting and messy but lack the energetic, unhinged pizzazz that bands like Slayer and Pestilence whipped up through the 80s. While consistent with one another, and the mood of both the iconic cover art and lyrical matter, I've never found all of the rhythm guitars to be that exciting (\"Nocturnal Fear\" and \"Into the Crypts of Rays\" have a handful I could do without). And then there are the experimental flourishes, not as eclectic and variegated as those later manifest to their sophomore album Into the Pandemonium, but not very interesting either. I like the wall of tortured howls that inaugurates \"Into the Crypts...\", but the 4 minute ambient ritual \"Danse Macabre\" sacrifices a little catchiness for its creepiness.\n\nScreams, whispers, a piano here, a violin shred there, a morbid mantra. Acceptable for a Halloween evening, since it sounds like it might hail from one of those holiday CDs you buy at the grocery store; or as background noise for some obscure, Gothic seduction, but not something I would expressly seek out for its own allure... Fortunately, none of these minor mars can heavily compromise the surface area of the EP, and its importance as a cornerstone for the incessant thrash, death, doom and black metal lineage of the 90s and beyond still stands as it approaches its third decade of existence. It's not the peak of this band's repertoire (wait a year), nor a Lord of the Rings for extreme metal. I'd liken it instead to Robert Howard's original Conan stories: elegant but barbaric, crude but descriptive. But is the one really all that less influential than the other in the end? One final note: I was originally exposed to this and its successor EP (Emperor's Return) separately, so I'll review them as such. Today's crowd has the convenience of acquiring them on a single disc, which in no way decreases their individual worth, and makes for a rather consistent full length experience.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\n(A note before beginning: \"Morbid Tales\" has endured a slew of re-releases over the years and a perpetually shuffling track listing. My copy is the most commonly available one now, which features twelve tracks compiling the original \"Morbid Tales\" release mixed with the subsequent \"Emperor's Return\" EP. Without an original copy of the band's debut EP, deciding what exactly entails \"Morbid Tales\" is more a matter of what version you have than concrete fact. Considering the popularity of my version, the fact that the \"Emperor's Return\" tracks were composed alongside those on \"Morbid Tales,\" my copy's branding as \"Morbid Tales\" rather than as a compilation, and for the sake of convenience and the prevention of redundancy, I've decided to review the compiled work as \"Morbid Tales\" rather than splitting the releases apart and covering them separately.)\n\nOne of the most heated and enduring debates in the metal critic \"community\" is whether older albums reviewed in a more contemporary era should be judged in terms of their position when the album was released versus how they hold up today. This discussion seems to pop up more often in metal's critical circles than in those of other musical styles, perhaps due to the style's unusually large community of reviewers, the similarly unusual regularity in which older albums are revisited by younger writers who entered the metal scene after many older albums' heyday, or even just the genre's emphasis on the importance of a sort of historical narrative. Metalheads, it seems, purchase older albums which aren't necessarily still relevant in the strictest sense with a regularity unmatched by those in other genres; or, to be more precise, less intensely involved fans of the style seem to partake in this sort of musical necromancy more frequently than those of other styles, where the resurrection and reexamination of older albums is more often the domain of the cantankerous grognards that inhabit other scenes. To rarefy the idea even further, metalheads seem more infatuated with discovering forgotten, definitively non-canonical albums of old than fans of other styles of music. It's for some of these reasons or all of them that discussions regarding the relevance of older albums tend to erupt so violently; there tends to be an emotional investment of a deeper degree than you might see in, say, the electronic community.\n\nFortunately enough for us metal critics, it seems that the decision is often made for us. It's a rare occasion that an album of old was brilliant then but comes off as a musical failure now, and it's equally rare that the garbage of old might become an unearthed gem later. There are exceptions to each, of course (Anthrax, I'd say, for the former, and Beherit is certainly a recognizable occupant of the latter category,) but more often than not, shit is shit and gold is gold without much waffling between the two. When it comes to the primary question of the judgment of albums, though, I tend to take the South Park approach: while we can hardly lambaste albums for evidencing the inherent limitations of their era (I'm not going to dock points from \"Altars of Madness\" for the distinct lack of gravity blasts or slams,) it could be said that the benchmark of truly great art is its ability to transcend its origin and maintain relevance despite the movement of ages. Wagner's work doesn't sound dated; nor should any other piece of truly great art. Once in a while, though, even that approach fails me, and I'm confronted by an album that forces me to question that view, tearing me between both my appreciation for metal history and my personal feelings and standards when viewed today. Celtic Frost's seminal debut \"Morbid Tales\" is one such release.\n\nReviewing \"Morbid Tales\" as an album alone puts one in a similar position as one who would attempt to review one of the original \"Star Wars\" movies as a film alone: it's nearly impossible. \"Star Wars\" has become such an omnipresent part of Western culture, so inescapable and deeply entrenched in cultural consciousness, that one's personal opinions and experiences with it are rendered sort of inappropriate and bizarre. One doesn't like or dislike \"Star Wars,\" really- it simply IS. Celtic Frost occupies a similar place which makes independent appraisal difficult. With \"Morbid Tales\" (and, to a certain degree, the band's entire early discography) forming such a pivotal role in the development of metal as a musical style, a judgment of \"Morbid Tales\" is rather easily interpreted as a judgment of all its descendants as well. If one enjoys extreme metal but doesn't find Celtic Frost's work compelling, it's somewhat challenging to justify. Celtic Frost carries so much historical baggage on its shoulders that one has to tread lightly to prevent misinterpretation.\n\nAs I've stated in many other reviews of older albums, and as is obvious to those who read my reviews regularly, my taste in heavy metal tends towards the modern and extreme. While I appreciate the significance and necessity of many releases from the early '90s and before, they rarely strike me on a particularly personal level. As my primary interests in metal are rooted in subgenres and styles developed later on, older metal records tend to lack a lot of the essential qualities I look for in metal releases. Occasionally one sneaks by and I find myself greatly enjoying it, but for the most part, the more restrained nature of the music tends to leave me itching for a more extreme, updated realization. Still, my earlier question comes to roost: should these releases be judged in the appropriate context, or is viewing them without historical consideration a fair tactic for analysis.\n\nI say all this because I can't say I greatly enjoy \"Morbid Tales.\" Without a doubt I understand how seminal and crucial a release it is- without it, all of my favorite bands today probably wouldn't exist. It forms the most primordial building blocks of black and death metal, and arguable stands as the most crucial single release contributing towards the later realization of the extreme metal ideal. That being said, I can't claim to enjoy a release purely in terms of its historical relevance, nor can I ham-fistedly defend it with one of those \"Black Sabbath was the heaviest band ever\" attempts at historical revisionism. Since one of the more remarkable qualities of \"Morbid Tales\" at the time of its release was its relative extremity and heaviness, the fact that these aspects have been so thoroughly exceeded by more modern works dates it pretty intensely; it goes without saying that no one listening to this now will be in awe of it in the same manner they may have back in the '80s. Between that, the undeniably simplistic, fairly one-dimensional songwriting, and the very flat, dry production, the album comes off as something of a victim of its time- there's very little to criticize, particularly when considering what might have been had it more options to explore.\n\nOne of the problems that afflicts this album (as does, in my opinion, many of the classic albums from the pre-extreme metal area) is that it's composed of a handful of tracks which so far outstrip the rest in quality and memorability that the album ends up feeling weirdly paced and somewhat padded. Let's face it: discussions of the best tracks on \"Morbid Tales\" are nearly identical whenever they pop up. \"Into the Crypts of Rays,\" \"Procreation of the Wicked,\" and \"Circle of Tyrants\" (with maybe \"Dethroned Emperor\" as a floater) are so overwhelmingly representative of Celtic Frost's style at the time and so clearly above and beyond the remaining tracks that the rest of the album is perpetually cast in their shadow. This wouldn't ordinarily be a problem- after all, few bands manage to craft songs as enduring as \"Procreation of the Wicked\"- except for the fact that on this disc there's another 8 tracks to keep in mind. These, unfortunately, tend not to fair so well- there's not many out there who would call, say, \"Return to the Eve\" a crucial part of the Celtic Frost catalog, and for good reason: it's simply not that great.\n\nTo elaborate on that idea: Celtic Frost's role as the primordial soup from whence came black and death metal is both to the benefit and downfall of the album. Listening to music like this is somewhat refreshing, considering how relentlessly striated and fractured the different styles of extreme metal have become. To this day, Celtic Frost's music is still somewhat unquantifiable; a well-blended and homogeneous (and I mean that in a good way) combination of proto-black, death, doom, thrash, trad, and hardcore punk, it's at once a sort of crossroads for all sorts of styles and unique in its own right. However, in another example of the curse of changed impressions and expectations, the best tracks come off as stirringly independent while the others tend to sound generic and uninspired. It's more my fault than the band's; in the modern metal scene, the heightened expectations and more distinct ideas of genre in both restricted metal and refined it to a vicious point, giving it less structural depth in many cases but also more immediacy. Most of the tracks on \"Morbid Tales\" lack that immediacy, though: they trudge, they chug, they creep along, employing all these different styles in a manner that would be described as the lowest common denominator had the denominator even existed at this point.\n\nWhile \"Morbid Tales\" was an undeniably essential part of extreme metal's growth and development, calling it an extreme metal album (or even more absurdly, a proper example of death or black metal) is a stretch I simply can't agree with. Much in the vein of \"Seven Churches\" or \"Black Metal,\" the usefulness of this album, in my mind, is more in what happened when others across the world attempted to copy it and failed, resulting in more unusual ideas. Structurally, this has much more in common with the heavy metal of the '70s than the extreme metal of the '90s, and perhaps just as much with punk as the traditional strains of heavy metal. Much of the material on this disc sounds like a beefed up, dark interpretation of Mot\u00f6rhead, particularly on the more energetic tracks like \"Visions of Mortality\"; there's a certain rock and roll spirit to much of this music that would be progressively stripped away by later artists. Thrash is one of the building blocks, but even at the band's fastest and most snapping, it rarely seems to reach for the feeling that thrash did; where the best thrash comes off as a sort of dizzying array of razors slashing at the listener, \"Morbid Tales\" sounds more like a series of heavy-handed punches to the gut. It's a blunt record- an interesting change of pace, but somewhat trying after a while.\n\nI'd say the production is to blame for much of the record's lack of connection with me, which is perhaps the part of this album I feel the worst about criticizing. This was a factor almost utterly out of the band's control; the production styles of modern black or death metal weren't even a thought, and there was no reason (or ability, for that matter) to approach this album's mixing in such a manner- this isn't even taking into account the obviously slim budget the band had at their disposal. Still, it's one of the biggest hurdles to appreciating this album that I have to jump over. It's very flat, very dry, and when combined with the already very simple songwriting that dominates the record, tends to make the songs sound even more minimal than they already are. The guitar tone is very constrained and midsy, the drums are flat and lack space (particularly in the kick and snare,) and the vocals, while often doused in echo, tend to sound sort of small and unobtrusive. The sound doesn't fill the musical space in the manner the music truly needs; you're left with what sounds like a very small band playing in a very large room with their amps set to 4. Oddly enough, the exception to this is the bass tone; it's rich, smooth, and perfectly balanced against the guitars, and while it lacks the slight growl I might prefer for the style, I can't bring myself to criticize it.\n\nThe end issue, though, is that aforementioned songwriting simplicity. It's not that aspect in and of itself- with how much Von I listen to, I'd be an utter hypocrite to take issue with it in isolation- but when combined with the production and overall style of the band, the songs often sound spartan to the point of minimalism. Tracks are composed of three or four very simple riffs each, and the straightforward drumming and vocal performance hardly help to provide a great deal more variation. In some ways, it's more primitive than Hellhammer (who, all things considered, probably came closer to the end aesthetic of black and death metal than Celtic Frost ever did,) and even my favorite songs on this album feel unadorned and begging for more texture, be it from more riffs, more dynamic songwriting structures, or simply a better, more expansive sound. In the end, I'll stand by my opinion that the songs themselves on this album tend to be strong and unique- it's all the other factors involved in their display to the listener which prevent me from enjoying them fully.\n\nAmusingly enough, my feelings towards \"Morbid Tales\" (and Celtic Frost's early work in general) tend to echo those of Tom Warrior himself. I was fortunate enough to catch the band opening for Type O Negative, touring off \"Monotheist.\" In interviews and on his blog, Tom has expressed feeling as though the band's change towards a more extreme, slower, downtuned, oppressive direction with \"Monotheist\" (and the subsequent reinterpretation of their older tracks in this manner) was a sort of long-awaited perfection of the band's aesthetic, and I tend to agree. When listening to live recordings of tracks like \"Procreation of the Wicked\" after \"Monotheist,\" the songs have a gravitas and drama to them that's an exponential improvement over their original form. The denim and leather coolness of the '80s is stripped out and replaced with a decayed, filth-ridden, occult vibe that manages to instantly update the music to legitimately compete with contemporary bands but still maintain its unique sense of style. \"Procreation of the Wicked\" on \"Morbid Tales\" feels like a cool, chugging, but ultimately rather human heavy metal track; the same song post-\"Monotheist\" is a frightening, ritualistic invocation of demons from beyond the veil. It was Celtic Frost finally achieving what they were meant for from the start; it's a shame that more didn't appreciate the transformation.\n\nI think it's substantially more insulting to an album to claim it excellent merely due to its influence and historical position than to give it a realistic, honest appraisal, so I'll say that while the historical significance of \"Morbid Tales\" is undeniable, that's where my interest in it essentially begins and ends. Hearing it is a rite of passage, and owning a copy is a sacrament, so I won't discourage anyone from acquiring a copy merely to have it. Unless you were around to hear the album when it was released, though, its musical properties are likely to fall flat- doubly so for those listeners like me who already have to overcome a relative lack of extremity. \"Morbid Tales\" has become extremely dated, and the era of its greatest significance has long passed- which, it might sound odd to say, I don't really consider a failing of the album, nor a particularly heavy slam against its overall quality; there's something to be said for art designed to be experienced at a certain moment in time, intrinsically temporary and present, designed for those in the right place at the right time to experience it in its full form and no one else. I laud this release and will never deny its significance, and the fact that it's been eclipsed is, given the circumstances, a sort of wry compliment: the student has become the teacher, the son the father, and while recording this album, Celtic Frost unknowingly signed its death warrant- perhaps what they'd always intended.\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost - Vanity/Nemesis: Or How Tom Got His Groove Back.\n\nThis is probably the only overlooked CF album. Notice I said \"overlooked\". Absolutely no CF fan is able to overlook the sore thumb that was Cold Lake. Hell, not even Tom G. Warrior can, no matter how hard he tries even today. So even their worst album (and one of the most baffling moves in the history of metal) is less overlooked than this, the album that managed to concentrate the best of mid-80's CF with a slightly tame preview of the monstrous, massive Monotheist (aren't alliterations fun?). And not only that, but it also brought forth a very compelling argument against the accepted genesis of a then-brand-new subgenre in metal. What subgenre is that, you say? Worry not; an explanation will swiftly follow.\n\nThere's one word that, in my opinion, dominates the album, and that word is Groove. Now, before you spew your Mountain Dew all over your your 10-year-old Cowboys From Hell T-Shirt and scream obscenities at me, know that I am well aware that \"Groove Metal\" as it is traditionally known has its origins on the mixing of classic heavy metal and southern (U.S.) music, giving the already heavy and thick sound a jumpy, energetic/energising and almost party-approved vibe. That is Groove.\n\nBut that, also, is what this album is, essentially. So, am I saying CF are just as responsible for the birth of groove metal as Pantera is? Hell, at this stage in life labels and tags and genres/subgenres/crossovers lose meaning by the hour, so I don't really give a bloody fuck. As far as I'm concerned Godflesh is responsible for all non-doom slower-paced types of metal that made their appearance in the late 80's, like sludge, groove and even stoner, so who the fuck cares about my opinion on the genesis of a subgenre? We're here to discuss CF's most overlooked album, but I'm also taking this opportunity to conduct an experiment which is basically an excellent example of a \"what if\" situation. My hypotesis is that, had people paid as much attention to this album as they paid to CF's early works, then hey, maybe an entire generation would look back on this album as seminal in the ways of groovin' metal.\n\nFrom the moment the first guitar string is picked we get a mouthfull of trademark CF riffs as a main dish, but with a rather unexpected side: They seem to have taken some very subtle elements from the \"glam\" era and adapted them to make what could have just been a more polished and less energetic To Mega Terion into a fist-pounding, catchy, groovy and groundbreaking ablum, once again proving that every release Mr. Warrior creates is seminal (we could even agree that Cold Lake was the best Glam Metal album, since it's such a horrendous, worthless \"subgenre\"). The guitars are thick and reverbered yet well under control. This could either be a good or a bad thing whether you like feedback and amp noises in genres where it doesn't really belong.\n\nThe bass and drums play second fiddle here, if only because of the excellent and gigantic guitar work and not because of subpar execution. The bass has a very interesting spring-like sound that would become popular throughout the 90's, especially in groove, sludge and stoner bands, as well as other non-metal genres influenced by the aforementioned (*ahem*mallcore*ahem*). The drum kit chosen for this record sounds rather dull, especially the bass drum (which happens all too often in metal), but the sheer... let's say cheerfulness and variation of Mr. Priestly's style more than makes up for the lack of a more fitting (read: rawer, more aggressive, more... contusive) sound.\n\nThere is yet another blast from the past in the form of experimentation. This time less schizophrenic and more thought out, it comes in the form of sudden timing/mood changes and very Into-The-Pandemoniumesque sections of clean/acoustic guitars and female vocals. This time these elements work more as a cohesive tool that ultimately shapes the album into a concrete, palpable work of art, instead of the more surreal, chaotic and even ethereal approach of Into The Pandemonium (not that that was a bad thing, mind you).\n\nTom's vocals sound basically the same as they did back in 1983, except this time the recording quality allows us to appreciate his (cleaner) tone and personality as close as we would ever be able to get. It can get a bit tiring at times, because they were mixed a bit too loud and up front. I think his (pre-Monotheist) vocals are better enjoyed with slight feedback and halfway between the drums and the guitar, but that's just me.\n\nSo what do we make of this album, after all is said and done? Well, to finish up my Pantera-comparisons and groove-originators conspiracy, let's think about a very odd fact: Pantera started as a shitty glam band until, one day, they decided to pump aggressivity, heaviness and a rock-ish groove to their sound, leaving the glam wankery behind and, allegedly, single-handedly inventing groove metal. Now let's look at Celtic Frost: A band that, with each release, has managed to shake, break and recreate the grounds of metal, one day decided to go glam. I don't think I need to tell you how that turned out. So what happened after that mother of a failed experiment? Celtic Frost decided to bring back the aggressivity, heaviness and thrashy sound of their earlier works, and add a rock-ish groove to their sound, leaving the glam wankery behind. Coincidence? I don't even know anymore, this is just a very fun thought experiment and also a good way to ease an estranged CF fan back into the horde. As long as they like to headbang, that is.\n\nAnd the other, major conclusion to this review is the following: Every Celtic Frost album (minus Cold Lake) is unique, groundbreaking and influential*. Every release has a special, unique sound, approach and quality to it that makes it stand tall amongst other albums of the same genre. What makes this particular album special and unique is that it manages to combine elements from every single one of their previous works (yes, including the only decent aspects of Cold Lake, like sound quality and guitar solos), as well as showcase (albeit in embryonic shape) elements from future albums (or rather future album period). And the most impressive part is that this amalgamation of groundbreaking elements into one album gave as a result a cohesive and sound album instead of something more resembling an inconsistent collection of b-sides.\n\nOverall, this beast of an album is not just a \"return to form\" (I don't know about you, but I'm rather sick of that stock phrase), and it's not just an \"I'm Sorry\" gift to make up for the horrid Cold Lake. This collection of chugging, heavy, thrashy and at the same time doom-ish riffs with a strong groove, aching solos, bouncy bass, lively drums and vocals with Attitude is a testimony to the seemingly inexhaustible creativity of one Mr. Tom G. Warrior.\n\n*even if sometimes said influence takes years to kick in\n",
        "\nHow the hell does one make up for an album such as \"Cold Lake?\" Answer: You don't. Your band who was a highly revered, innovative, mega cult-like band that made such an impressionable and highly resonating mark in Metal's golden era gets the silent treatment for turning in an album that is still to this day considered one of the worst point's in the historical timeline of the musical genre. Sorry Jack, it's not going to start winning your points back from such a commercial suicide/fallout. That's just the sad truth. But all in all even if it was a rough period in one's career it's also now looked upon as a underrated album. It is, \"Vanity/Nemesis\" is a vastly underrated album, but it isn't in the fact that it's an album that is more or less considered make-up sex in the weird relationship between a band and their loyal fans. Tom G. Warrior and company got caught with their pants down and now are trying to be all \"Baby I love you, don't leave me!\" Shawanda is going to tell yo black ass off on Maury next Tuesday.\n\nLike many older interviews with Tom G. Warior, he's more than likely explained himself about the somewhat erratic/bi-polar behavior of post \"Into The Pandemonium\" era of CF, and I'll be honest I've completely forgotten those excuses not just due out of being a fan but probably because I think such trivial things are meant to be forgotten because simply put, they are purely trivial. Again, as stated this was more or less an album to make up for \"Cold Lake\". It does. Once you actually sit down and listen to this, the first thing that pops into your head is \"Holy shit! This is pretty damn good considering all things.\" I mean if the opening riff from \"The Heart Beneath\" doesn't get you playing air-guitar to that heavy-as-fuck DUN DUN DUN DUN DUNNA DUN DUN DUN DUN DUNNA riff from hell and the classic Warrior grunt then you're in denial. It's a thrashy little diddly that works like a charm in trying to get the fan to listen. Even the following song \"Wine In My Hand\" continues it and goes at a faster tempo. But that's what the big difference about \"Vanity/Nemesis\" is: another major change in the CF sound. Don't expect \"Morbid Tales\", or \"To Mega Therion\". This is a more classic 80's thrash sound based CF instead of the innovative extreme Metal sound they help created. The music is still heavy, still chunky sounding, and still evil-sounding....but \"Vanity/Nemesis\" sounds more like a Coroner album if anything.\n\nPrime examples of this new Coroner sound would be songs such as \"The Name of My Bride\", \"A Kiss Or A Whisper\"(which this actually one song that mixes CF and Coroner), so forth and so on. Which is GOOD considering everything else. Plus this new Cornoer-esque edge/sound to their brand of molten metal is somewhat expected since main man Tom G. Warrior helped catapult Coroner into the trash scene to become a generally respected technical Thrash monster when a lot of other bands who tried to be technical fell short of the promise of mind-massacring metal. You also have songs that somewhat resonate an \"Into the Pandemonium\"-vibe with \"The Wings Of Solitude\" and even a certain song that starts out with the epic screams to Morbid Tales \"Human\" intro on the song \"Nemesis\".....as a previous review said, this album is slightly inconsistent. This album is a showcase of CF trying to pull every trick from it's hat to win back fans and it shows. Again, this is by no means a bad album in the least bit. The production is excellent. The riffs are there. Everything that is Celtic Frost is there, but it's like two different albums put into one and when you combine that and the fallout from \"Cold Lake\", you're going to have an album that more or less is for serious die-hard fans only. \n\nTo sum this album up it's a bit more challenging. It's Celtic Frost that's for sure. If you were to mix it with a more thrashy Coroner-edge with certain sounds from their first 3 albums and an early 90's sound production on top of it sounding like two albums combined into one album AND it being this \"back-to-basics\" type album, you would get \"Vanity/Nemesis\"; a massively underrated mixed bag of goodies for the die-hard CF fan.\n",
        "\nAnd this is where the mighty kingdom/legacy that the mighty Celtic Frost helped created started to change. \"Into the Pandemonium\" is an album which came after two e.p.s, and one full length album that were nothing short of genius. Well guess what happens on LP number two? They threw the fucking rule book out the window and literally gave birth to more genres: most specifically goth metal and avant-garde metal while STILL being extremely influential to all of the other extreme metal genres at the time in the 80's...which blew every metal head's mind away and that was the problem. Nobody expected this radical progression/change after the monumental \"To Mega Therion\" album, and it still has people scratching their heads. Celtic Frost again goes into uncharted territories here where they start incorporating other forms of musical influences. This was right before their career suicide with \"Cold Lake\" but for 1987 \"Into the Pandemonium\", which was not really their absolute apex of their career which would go to their final album \"Monotheist\", this was definitely paintings more hues of gloom and doom in the kingdom of Celtic Frost before it went into a watery descent. \n\nCeltic Frost has always had a high priority of incorporating the right artwork for the albums. \"Morbid Tales\" had the evil heptagram signaling the beginning of it's evil incantation. \"To Mega Therion\" saw that noisy bastard child grow into a great beast of a man and \"Into the Pandemonium\" is a glimpse into it's lair of darkness. Much like Cocytus in Dante's \"Inferno\", we see and hear the river of wailing where the emperor drinks from. The painting is by none other than the great Hieronymus Bosch and is actually a tiny portion from a triptych painting called \"The Garden of Earthly Delights.\" Listening to the album, it perfectly suites the artwork where the gates to CF's domain are opened and we see what are behind those cold walls of solid stone. And yes it's shocking to say the least. \n\nProduction-wise \"ITP\" sees CF at their most professional, because everything is just clear. Most of the songs sound like they are presented in a very theatrical type way where the listener is left to shock and awe. There is a new bounce/sound to this album and it's capturing that bottom-end heaviness of the reverberation of the guitars. Not that CF's sound productions prior did not capture them, but this album is giving off just a heavy echo. A loud echo that is bouncing off the stone walls much like shown in the album cover's artwork.\n\n\"Into The Pandemonium\" starts off with....a Wall of Voodoo cover? That's a pretty huge risk for a band like CF. I am sure this confused the shit out of people back in the day, but may be they had to have something that would raise an ironic chuckle out of metal heads because after the up-beat 80's one hit wonder cover, it gets fucking depressing. It's not fast or thrashing but way more doomier and way more goth/electronic-influenced. Even the vocals are so damn morose and self-loathing you wonder if these guys were simply playing along to the likes of Christian Death and The Sisters of Mercy. Oh the riffs are still there. If that is one thing you can rely upon from Celtic Frost is that they had riffs. Heavier than a sack of donkey balls. But here we see a lot of the songs slowed-down to a Sabbath doom chugging rarely getting anywhere near the previous material from these Swiss Gods. \"Mesmerised\" is exactly what I am referring to. There are a couple of songs where it is more old-school flavored such as \"Inner Sanctum\" and \"Babylon Fell\" which I could have seen easily as part of \"To Mega Therion\" or even leftovers from the \"Tragic Serenades\" e.p., but everything else is: weird. Female vocals and classical instruments \"Tristesses de la lune\", to mini-like sonnets \"Rex Irae (Requiem: Overture)\" with what sounds like Tom G. Warrior sounding like a Rozz Williams strung out on heroin. Lyrically speaking, this goes beyond anything that Tom G. Warrior has written: \n\n\"[REMEMBRANCE I:]\n\nWe stood before the portals of Babylon\nAnd saw it's petrified fall\n... Have seen your decline's symbols\nBut carried another life\nWe tasted the wine of Persepolis,\nAs mute as our era's breath\nDeath was never a fragment of\nExalting fantasy ...\n\n[REMEMBRANCE III :]\n\nThis last region - Last of fire\nOrgasmic cries - Tears and words\nWrath and strenght - Oh, gods! For you!\nBefore the throne ... - Death\" - \"Rex Irae (Requiem: Overture)\"\n\nor another prime example:\n\n\"This evening the moon dreams more lazily\nAs some fair woman, lost in cushions deep\nWith gentle hand caresses listlessly\nThe contour of her breasts before she sleeps\nOn velvet backs of avalanches soft\nShe often lies enraptured as she dies\nAnd gazes on white visions aloft\nWhich like a blossoming to heaven rise\" - \"Tristesses de la Lune\"\n\nThen there is the one song that people cannot seem to get straight and I will defend this song because it's good; \"One In Their Pride\". This is NOT a fucking hip-hop song. Just because something had drum machine, samples, and loops does not merit it to anything dealing with rap or hip-hop. This is nothing short of what would be found on Ministry's \"Twitch\" when Al Jourgenson was making the switch from new romantic to drugged-out rivothead. There are two versions of this song and the only difference is that one isn't as multi-layered and again sounds like early Ministry. I love this song because I love 80's industrial and that cold mechanical feel of the music from that era and for Celtic Frost to have incorporated something like that into an album, this is why I love CF so much. they were not afraid to try different things. The best song on here is \"I Won't Dance\" with it's infectious jazz-like drumming and it's pop-like chorus. It's excellent in the riff department and simply sums up everything about the album: experimental, multi-layered with lyrics and themes that make you scratch your head.\n\n\"Into The Pandemonium\" is an album that signaled the end of the classic era of Celtic Frost, what happened extremely shortly afterwards is pure tragedy. Very ironic when considering this album is very much steeped into the whole theatrical sense of tragedy and the descent into sorrow afterwards. Again, with everything else up to this and \"Monothiest\" is pretty much essential to a metal head's music library because of what those albums meant at the time. And what this album represented at the time was the warrior's trip into the pandemonium...and yes I will say it.....never to be seen again.\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost's second album is nothing short of a masterpiece considering it was their first full-length LP if you don't count the fact that \"Morbid Tales\" was only an E.P. that was re-issued with the classic \"Emperor's Return\" E.P. in order to make it seem like a full-length LP. In fact it's nothing short of brilliant; the musical equivalent of Conan the Barbarian. An ancient warrior in a distant land taking everything with might, power, and projecting fear and respect to all whom cross it's path. Basically this is Celtic Frost at their finest. Yeah this may be argumented amongst other metal fans but it's almost like saying which of the first 3 Venom or Bathory albums are the best? Celtic Frost were one of those bands that gave birth to a genre and their first few burnt offerings to it's bestial summoning were nothing short of a combination of energy, youth, testosterone, and the mischievous dabblings with the dark side.\n\nFirst off: the artwork. Celtic Frost always had an eye for something that would stand-out and make their records matter in the eyes of metal heads. Regardless of what you might think of the music in it's brutal simplicity....they knew what artwork meant. I mean; heptagrams, H.R. Giger, Hieronymus Bosch, demons, skulls. \"Le childish satanic musings. You do not know art young child. Come and listen to more sophisticated modern-day music for 20-something year olds who have ironic French mustaches and smoke cheap cigarettes that your grandfather even found appalling back in the day.\" Fuck off. Go listen to Owl City or some shit like that. I say give me more heptagrams, H.R. Giger, etc.etc. A nasty looking rusted green and white demon with skull-faced snakes and black crosses surrounded it while holding the figure of Jesus in a mocking and ironic way like a slingshot? The great beast it just might not be, but the audio essence of youth gone wild and still rebelling for all it's worth. Brilliant.\n\nSound wise this is more more clearer than \"Morbid Tales\" and almost rawer than that as well. Again, there's a reason why I pick this over \"Morbid Tales\" as far as the DEFINITE Celtic Frost album to own in your music collection. Even with a clearer sound, Celtic frost have retained that rawness of their unique mid-paced Sabbath/blackened-thrashing-doom guitar tone from fucking hell, and made it much more razor sharp on \"To Mega Therion.\" For 1985, this is fucking extreme. It still IS extreme, but I'm talking specifically for that year. Yes 1985 also had \"Seven Churches\", and \"Infernal Overkill,\" but those were more based on speed. Celtic frost, again, were more about the blow behind the punch. And the blow pretty much blew every all the metal out of their fan's heads that year.....still to this day.\n\nThen there are the songs themselves. They have them. Lots of 'em. The intro \"Innocence & Wrath\" is exactly what I was saying about youth, energy, testosterone and Connan The Barbarian? Yeah, that's the epic-like intro intoducing the gladiators before they step into the ring, or announcing the Hunns coming out of the cave. You have glorious tales such as \"Jewel Throne\" wtih that main chugging downtuned riff from hell, the always classic and seizure-inducing \"Circle of The Tyrants\" which calls to the likes of Genghis Khan, and the chilling/freezing \"Necromantical Screams.\" Then there are others songs which is what made Celtic Frost such an entity in the Metal universe which what mades these songs come to life; songs like \"Eternal Summer\", \"Dawn of Meggido\", \"(Beyond) the North Winds\" where these are basic extensions and more colors to the pallet that gave their creations such a life of their own. Even though by the time their next album their music would start to reminiscent of the album artwork they put on their LP sleeves, for now this is simply one of the best examples of an album taking you out of your everyday situation and letting your mind drift to a world where it's pure dungeons and dragons in the best of ways. Even the other instrumental \"Tears In A Prophet's Eyes\" were not only what I just mentioned but also an excellent example of a band not backing down from the hunt and will to conquer uncharted territory. Even the lyrics to some of these songs are nothing short of inspiring:\n\n\"On days of northern wind, (past) illusions surround my dreams\nDrops of mute oceans breath in the palm of my hand\nThe sound of silent waves still caresses all my thoughts\nWhere warm, mystic floods dominated the upper hemisphere\" - \"(Beyond) the Northern Winds\"\n\nor this little diddy:\n\n\"Once prayed to my gods, searching for the whistled memories\nEmpty eyes are staring now, to my feet a land of sorrow\nI'm the king, sitting in the dark hiding from the shadows of the wind\nWafts of might, wine of fire, I was called to taste\" - Jewel Throne\n\nTom G. Warrior and company weren't fucking around when it came to trying to give his fans something just to listen to, but to read into and again expanding their imaginations. \n\nMuch like the great Mongolian conqueror Genghis Khan, Celtic Frost's greatest good fortune came from chasing their enemy of mediocrity and anything that did not deliver heaviness. They seized Metal's slaves and possessed their minds with tales of victory and defeat, and they also left their followers weeping and wailing in the end...\"To Mega Therion\" is still to this day is like an everlasting shadow in the Metal universe.\n",
        "\nThere are some things I don't understand in the metal world and one of those things is the popularity and the high ratings of this record. Let's say that the debut album of the Swiss metal legend is not bad at all. It has its own style but the record is far from being a legendary milestone as there are too many similar filler tracks on the record. Celtic Frost play some technically well done blackened thrash here. Even though the artwork is great, the lyrics are intriguing and the sound quality is very underground, the band fails to establish a gripping atmosphere. In the black metal scene, the first works of \"Bathory\", \"Emperor\" or \"Moonspell\" sounded way more addicting, the death metal scene had some great potential with the first releases of \"Death\", \"Therion\" or \"Amorphis\" and the world of thrash has seen the great debut records of \"Metallica\", \"Voivod\" and \"Overkill\". Every of the mentioned records has more style and charm than the first steps of Celtic Frost no matter if those records came before or after this one. There is still a lot of potential in this record that is worth your time, patience and attention. I might underline that this is a very good and interesting album and surely an influential piece of metal music. But it is no masterpiece or milestone because it has too many mediocre parts next to the pure genius that can also be found in here.\n\nWith the great instrumental \"Tears In A Prophet 's Dream\" and the closing album highlight \"Necromential Screams\", the band proves us that they had the potential to create an atmospheric and gripping milestone. The songs are filled with great sound effects and a lot of black atmosphere. They have surely influenced some of the bands mentioned above without a doubt but they copied the pioneers in a more consistent way. \nThe problems don't start in the beginnings of the record though but can rather be found in the middle of the album. \"Innocence And Wrath\" is a great instrumental introductions that leads to a great straight opener called \"The Usurper\" that has a lot of diversity and energy at the same time. \n\nBut \"Jewel Throne\" has almost the same style as this song and may be a solid banger but nothing truly addicting and outstanding. The problem is that there are at least three or four other songs of that kind on the record that somewhat destroy the efforts of the more elaborated and atmospheric tracks. I may even include the overrated and well known \"Circle Of The Tyrants\" to that same mediocre category. They are great live tracks, have a lot of energy and some riff variation plus good though not excellent guitar solos. On the other hand, they don't nearly have the same of majesty as the opening and closing tracks as well as \"Dawn of Meggido\" and remain rather one-dimensional bangers with lots of rather ridicolous signature \"Hey!\" and \"Uh!\" shouts in most of those songs. One or two of them may be acceptable but there are a too much of them on this short album. Especially as they are almost all in one row and not placed between the more epic tracks to give us a break. Their is really a heavy downfall of quality in the middle of this album.\n\nOne of the hidden highlights on this record is the following \"Dawn of Meggido\" which is an atmospheric doom metal track that adds a lot of heart and soul to the album again and is easily one of my favourite tracks in here. The orchestral middle part is innovating and reminds me of brilliant horror movie scores. That's an element that would have fit to more songs on this record and would have add something special to the album.\n\nThat's why this album seems in the end quite schizophrenic to me. It is divided into atmospheric, majestic and innovating tracks one side and straight filler songs to bang your head to on the other side in quite equal parts. I really adore the first face of the band whiel the second one is not all bad but simply not as outstanding and engaging as many fans claim. In the end, this record is still an important album for three different metal genres and the innovating parts are truly inspiring and innovating. But as this level can't be kept on the length of the entire album, I would not call this record a masterpiece as it lacks of coherence in the end and I only truly enjoy about twenty of the fourty minutes in here. That's why I think the album is slightly overrated.\n",
        "\nThere are some bands that don't even need to be uttered in the Metal universe; their name just makes mere metal maniacs tremble at their lips and go into convulsions to to extreme worship. One of those bands is Celtic Frost. Imagine a mountain somewhere in some far off land and there is an old man in a cave. Below the mountain is a thriving happy sun-filled village while the old man is in the cave covered in cobwebs, surrounded by ancient furniture from a medieval time and upon his head, a rusty crown where the diamonds have turned to brass. It's face covered in dust, grime, and streaks of blood across his mouth. He was put there for a purpose it seems. Something too fucking extreme happened to this rotting shell of a man eons ago that put him in such an extreme state of exile. That pretty much sums up Celtic frost, and for those that don't know, they have had one of the most rockiest histories in the Metal universe. Well, now that those iron chains have rusted and corroded with enough time, that same old man breaks free from them and walks out setting forth to take back the very lands beneath him he once conquered, and failed at, but now after years of silence....the old king is taking it's final war campaign against all that have shunned and forgotten him. That honery motherfucker is PISSED! \n\nCeltic Frost did no wrong with their first 3 albums. Each priceless, timeless classics inspiring and influencing thousands of endless worshippers then \"Cold Lake\" happened and the king(s) was forever vanished. Like a great hall in some castle his(their) good deeds are remembered in a golden age where everything they did was gold then something happened. Well, their final album \"Monotheist\" makes you forget that \"Cold Lake\" even happened. What makes this album so effective in the CF dischography is that it's NOT \"Morbid Tales prt. 2.\" It's not \"To Mega Therion....the continuation.\" Nor is it even the a sister to the avantgarde masterpiece of \"Into the Pandemonium.\" In fact, I'll go on to say that this album is beyond those albums. They didn't retread familiar ground. They didn't try to re-create. No, this is just a huge fucking iron fist to the face of everyone who doubted them for so long. And they took their special brand of darkness and actually modernized it to stay with the current times. Most bands cannot do that. They cannot progress THIS damn good. If they did they would have had to have written an album in the 80's and 90's when things were fresh and the future had endless possibilities. Celtic Frost had almost two decades in the darkness and absence from the modern day Metal scene and this albums shows it.\n\nTom G. Warrior. The man. The voice. The grunt. UGH! The Warrior is back with original bassist Martin Eric Ain (who btw, looks like a fucking caveman these days) and two new members; guitarist Erol Unala and drummer Franco Sesa. With new members come new sounds and the new sound is a a pitch black droning doom sounds. It's black. it's fucking metal. It's somewhere centered between all the genres they influenced. It's also much like the album that SHOULD have been written between \"To Mega Therion\" and \"Into the Pandemonium.\" but even then it's way more fucking eviler. I mean, you know the old saying you can't teach an old dog new tricks? Bullshit. Old yeller went and got rabies and slaughtered the entire fucking family on this one. Riff wise, there is no shortage of those back-breaking, soul-burning, psychotic-inducing riffs that Tom G Warrior has been known to create. He goes for broke in making his heaviest riffs ever. \n\n\"Monothiest\"....right off the bat the album again captures the idea that may be whatever god or gods the majority of human beings are praying to...simply aren't listening in the least bit. Don't give a crap and have given up on their creation once and for all. It's a bitter but truthful idea that man creates his own hell based off the mere image of his negative characteristics and there's no shortage of CF( and metal in general) holding that mirror up and showing man for the beast he can be. The album opens up with \"Progeny\"....that intro wall of guitar feedback and then you hear it...\"UGH!\" oh yes. Then for the next hour and eight minutes the heaviness does not stop. Tom G. Warrior takes you through the demented mind of that dethroned emperor I mentioned that has planned for a long time to reclaim his kingdom. It's really hard to go into vivid detail about the songs because the album as a whole is just one blackened monolith that stands alone in their discography. Again the music doesn't go into pure thrashing mode that one would expect. In fact one should remember was that CF was a band that made NO fucking promises or compromises about their music. Again, you're going to find the music mainly shifting between a funeral-like doom dirge CRAWL(\"A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh\"), some weird female vocals(\"Drown In Ashes\"), lots of \"UGH!\"(\"Ground\"), and a SHITLOAD of infernal darkness(\"Triptych\" a song trilogy containing some of the most evil-sounding music this side of the fjords of Norway.) \n\nCeltic Frost COULD have planned this. Really. Even earlier I said they never promised anything, but they could still have planned this album. For all the flak they got for so long, they came back with their final stand reminding people just who the real emperors are. Remember that village I mentioned at the beginning? Decades later, people say there was a plague of some sorts that made everything disappear. They said it became a barren wasteland where nothing grows and where even vultures do not soar into because they won't find anything......except......in the blackened land where it was once green, now is covered in the smell of smoke, where the temperature is forever deathly cold, and somewhere in that apocalyptic wasteland...the lies a rusted crown where the diamonds have turned to brass. Congratulations Celtic Frost.\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost is a band that I hold in very high regard. This bands influence on all things metal is absolutely undeniable, but in 1988 when the band released the disaster that was Cold Lake the bands future was in serious question. Vanity/Nemesis is not Cold Lake part 2, in fact it more or less is a return to the heavy inspired metal that the band churned out consistently. I find that this album is very underrated and contains some excellent songs mixed with some not so great moments. \n\nFirst things first this albums major flaw is it's inconsistency. Right out of the gate your hit with the one two punch of The Heart Beneath and Wine In My Hand. These two songs are energetic and heavy slabs of solid metal. They both are written well and contain great playing throughout. Then comes The Wings of Solitude and The Name of My Bride and it all falls apart. The riffs are weak and other than the chorus of Wings of Solitude these two songs are not worth the time. This is a recurring pattern throughout all of Vanity/Nemesis. \n\nTom Warrior's voice on this album is good at times and others he sounds like a child with down syndrome. In a driving song like Phallic Tantrum it fits well but in the song Vanity he comes across as laughable. The guitar playing is good, both Warrior and Bryant are competent and capable guitar players. The solos for the most part are well played but sometimes they dwell in wank territory (the Heart Beneath and A Kiss or a Whisper come to mind). \n\nStephen Preisty's drumming is in top form here, just listen to the thunderous double bass in Wine In My Hand it's awesome stuff. The drums also play the right beat to match the guitar riffs or keep certain songs grooving, the fills and cymbal work is well placed too. Martin's bass isn't that loud and plays a big part as too why the sound of this album is weak. \n\nThe songs on Vanity/Nemesis are a varied bunch. Most of the time the music is mid to fast paced but occasionally slows down to let the more emotional and calm tracks breathe. Celtic Frost obtains a thrashy, and traditional sound here. It works for the most part but every now and then one of those melodic riffs from Cold Lake rear their ugly head and throw the atmosphere off kilter.\n\nVanity/Nemesis sound wise, like I stated earlier is weak. The production is muffled and Martin's bass is not prominent in the mix, on albums like To Mega Therion and Morbid Tales the bass was loud and in your face, that is not the case here. Unfortunately Tom's voice is front and center along with the drums. Speaking of vocals I feel the excessive use of female vocals on this album is redundant and a bit...distracting I guess. \n\nThe female vocals in Wings of Solitude are awful. She sings the entire verse and backup on the chorus of that song and sounds ridiculous. I guess Tom wanted to increase the dramatic nature of the lyrics but it comes across as goofy honestly. Michele Amar has a good voice don't get me wrong but for god's sake she is on almost every song and kills the mood! \n\nTruth be told I do like this album and I listen to it frequently. It is not on the level of To Mega Therion or even Into the Pandemonium but does display a more emotional and mature side of Celtic Frost. I say give it a shot because that is the beauty of Celtic Frost, everything sounds different and you can experience a lot from album to album.\n",
        "\nWithin the maelstrom beyond the edge of the universe described within its lyrics, a blackened cosmic tryst between Uranus the sky god and a dark mattered succubus resulted in this illegitimate monster that no one would claim but the mighty but broken homed child Tom Warrior and his compatriots many eons later. Some even say that these two beings might be one in the same; the son without a father becomes his own father! And like the final Olympian grandchild of Uranus, they sought revenge against their ghost fathers for their sins. The beast, forced to bring itself up upon the frozen depths of starless space, eventually found its way to earth. It watched humanity devour itself and drew near the kindred darkness within our cursed hearts. Learning of what lay beyond death; it crystallized into this reminder, not unlike the golden record that sits within Voyager I and II, as something that summarizes our condemnation to the depths.\n\nThe words of Therion/Warrior speak of truly dark things, for they could know no other but such a truth. Towers fall to dust and man falls into flame. Nostalgia is erased as the deep sorrow and frailness of the old takes its place. The protagonists and antagonists both rot and tremble within their halls upon darkthrones. Even in their desire to know the unknowable and escape the endless curse of death and rebirth, they cannot resist the swiping pendulum that levels both monuments and solar bodies. Their dark armies pale and falter as the nightmares of prophets and the sorrow of dying elders reveal only approaching catastrophe. As the monster warns with staggering eloquence \u201cfor no one who knows tries to reappear\u201d and seek to take part in the horror that they left behind.\n\nThe howls of despair and anger of the forsaken sons strike with hurricane force while human allies Reed St. Mark and Dominic Steiner channel such light-bereft doom into colossal and dusty rhythms. Warrior brings the potential of the electric guitar to fruition as purely blunt rhythmic weapon of war; battering and crashing down the gates of that which came before. Like mighty hammers crashing down upon dirty helmets in its slowest and most monolithic moments, it grinds the earth and stars beneath skeleton tank treads. At times we hear the sounds of battle that echo from deep within history, drums many times the size of any modern beast are beaten upon by dark stone giants. Huge battle horns bellow, reversing the flow of the wind. When the Usurper charges all hell breaks loose and we hear every stamping footstep and galloping hoof beating musical fury unheard of before those hallowed times. Like then thousand typhoons they crash against the grain of your mind.\n\nWhen the cacophony subsides for a time to open the nightmares of aforementioned prophet, we see that under the ceaseless destruction the empathy and tears shed for the coming end. Sounds coaxed from the modern electronics gives us an idea of the horrors that drive such men to madness. The Original Child Bomb blasts while shocks of bass driven psychosis shred the minds of the survivors. Laughing human devils exceed their mythical counterparts with effortless glee. Chants of newly formed death cults bring forth hell\u2019s inhabitants. Cries of pain and ecstasy mingle until they become inseparable from one another. How can one not share tears with this poor soul? And then the finale arrives, bringing another of life\u2019s many shivers up your spine.\n\nMany young people who came across the newly fossilized remains of the creature 25 years ago tried with varying levels of success to replicate it and pay blood tribute. They tried to build upon the crumbled suits of armor and tattered flags of memory; memories before the birth of all beings who came before. All in this upstart genre of human rejects and lost children. Countless worship the sounds of this record and the other works of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost and heeded the warnings. Some sought orthodoxy while others refined and pushed the remnants of the dark spawn further and further. Those who succeeded are in turn worshiped by the new heirs to the sound. \n\nFollowing my forbearers, I, another acolyte in search of such texts and swarms of sound came to partake in its still fountain 20 years after its fossilization. It was far beyond anything my teenage ears had listened to until that time, even its precursor and herald Morbid Tales, in terms of extremity. Like those who seek out darker and deeper relics of the time before birth, I wanted to belong to something beyond what was expected of listeners of music. There would be no turning back after this point. The tides of steel are pulled by works like this one, along with the other great masters of the time. I feel moments of great joy when I hear the traces of this record in newer monuments to the sad monster and his human form, the chugging of crying battle engines and grunts of load bearing souls. True and intelligent poetry is to be found here. If you do not know, then you must.\n",
        "\nWith a career as long, influential and illustrous as that of the almighty Celtic Frost, most commercially succesful bands start churning out compilations and best-ofs at an alarming rate. Not so with Celtic Frost, they didn't release an actual best-of album before their reunion and the 2003 Are You Morbid?, and kept their original, beautiful run clean of such trivial and unnecessary cash grabs. What, then, is Parched with Thirst Am I and Dying? \n\nParched with Thirst Am I and Dying is a compilation of things in the way compilations are supposed to be made. Instead of simply skimming the cream from the top and arbitrarily choosing the \"top\" tracks for those people who are too lazy or poor to get the original albums, Celtic Frost offers some interesting stuff on the compilation. No, this is not a \"best-of\". A few unreleased tracks that were only included on re-releases of their respective albums after this compilation saw daylight, a few alternative versions of familiar tracks, and incredible honesty in the form of several Cold Lake songs.\n\nPerhaps the most rewarding part of the compilation is the fact that the songs chosen are holotypes of their respective albums, and the few previously unreleased tracks are obvious children of their recording sessions as well. \"Descent to Babylon\" and \"The Inevitable Factor\" reek of Into the Pandemonium, and the tracks chosen off Vanity/Nemesis are perfect examples of the litter they sprang from. Uniquely, this leads to a an interesting situation: the tracks recreate the band's career, excluding Morbid Tales, in an zig-zagging mess, but still keep things interesting with the previously unreleased tracks and alternative versions. \n\nEven the tracks off Cold Lake, in their re-recorded form, sound surprisingly good, and to those of us who have never heard the originals, it throws a wrench in the gears of those who thrash the album. While the originals are probably pitiful glam-drenched attempts at justifying an era of bi-curious lipstick experiments, the re-recordings are good tracks. \"Juices Like Wine\" sees Mr Warrior as his grumpy, sexy self, trying to bring a new life to an obviously lackluster song, but the rather riff-heavy production has the almost thrashy guitar drilling throughout the song's length, and whatever the original was like, this version raises the song into the \"upper mediocre\" category among Frost's catalogue. It's not a masterpiece, and remains a rather simplistic song, but offensive it is not. \"Cherry Orchards\" is even present in its original form, although as a slightly shortened radio edit. Brave honesty!\n\nAs a cross-cut of the lengthy and complex Celtic Frost history, the compilation, and especially its longer 18-track CD version, works wonders. It hauls the listener from the Emperor's Return era straightforward angry blackened thrashing, through the To Mega Therion's budding avant-garde and Into the Pandemonium's full-blown atmospheric experiments, all the way into the strange and confusing poppy alien surroundings, taking the re-recorded detour via the crater of failure known as Cold Lake. There isn't much else to say, although the lack of songs from Morbid Tales strikes a fan of the band as odd. Why by-pass such an important EP? We may never know, but if a compilation is supposed to have a \"flow\", or simply to stay together as a pleasurable listening experience, Morbid Tales' Hellhammerish and abrasive character might have interrupted the story arch, and disturbed the progression of the alien feel of Celtic Frost's later works.\n\nIt would be very interesting to see such a compilation now. How would the slow, crushing and primal despair of Monotheist fit the works of Frost's earlier career? Can the two be combined at all, with the 16 years between Vanity/Nemesis and Monotheist, or is the hidden progression that took place during the decade and a half something that can't be bridged at all? We may never know. It's quite likely that the creative restraint of the band is too perfect for a post-mortem. At least judging by the rarity of such releases so far. We may now enjoy Triptykon, and if the title track of the Shatter EP is anything to judge by, Celtic Frost didn't die due to lack of creativity. Martin Eric Ain's contributions to the world of music still remain to be seen, but the promise is there.\n\nThis compilation is definitely worth your money. There are no unnecessary pieces of blubber or song choices that reek of easy cash-grabbing. No, this is value, from the beginning to the end, and lays bare a mighty career. Get this!\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost never betrayed me. For one, I was born two years late to even be alive at the very instant this was released. However, while the band\u2019s fanbase was indeed pissed off (for the most part), it would be another seventeen or so years before I even checked out Celtic Frost for myself. I didn\u2019t really care much for them, considering that I latched onto my second wave black metal tighter than a baby and some candy. A little while later, sure, I checked them out again, but it was Vanity / Nemesis that won me over with its nasty riffs and bitter attitude. The vocals were one thing, and I never considered Tom G. that good of a vocalist \u2013 he\u2019s like Mustaine (his vocals only work for his own band). However, I will admit that I knew about Cold Lake and its notoriety and was curiously lured into it more than the famous material that legitimizes the band\u2026\n\n\u2026 and Cold Lake is indeed catchy. \u201cCherry Orchards\u201d was my introduction, and for everything negative that I will say about this in a few moments, I will say that it is pretty addicting. The rest of the album doesn\u2019t nearly hold up to the same infectious-levels of this one song because they\u2019re all disjointed. However, this one \u201chit\u201d - the incredibly simplistic riff, the hollow drumming, the lifeless persona, and the laidback vibe - all make for one easy song to be interrupted by. Once again, the whole album doesn\u2019t exactly have this taste to it, but this one song always brings me back to laugh at and cherish in my own special way.\n\nTo be the Devil\u2019s advocate, it\u2019s not really an entirely bad album at the core. It\u2019s a far shot away from 1st wave black / thrash and all that, but Vanity / Nemesis is just a 10X better version of this without all the negatives. The image is one thing that definitely lures you into the wrong direction, but the bass guitar is furious and grumbles well among the mid-paced tempo of the album as a whole. It catches your attention when the guitars move between tame-thrash and typical glam rock riffs (\u201cJuices Like Wine\u201d and \u201cDowntown Hanoi\u201d (a little, but not to say that they\u2019re good)) \u2013 straightforward, but effective in providing a memorable groove. Rarely is solo halfway decent, like with \u201c(Once) They Were Eagles\u201d where the solo bends and twists passionately before spiraling like fireworks. Production isn\u2019t too bad overall, with the bass once more the liveliest of the bunch.\n\nNow excuse me while I go do some stretches\u2026\n\nAll right, Cold Lake is a sorry excuse of an album that failed heavy metal fans, failed attracting new fans, failed music as a whole, failed attempting to be half-decent glam rock (even by piss-poor \u201890s standards, which are gutter-level), failed in it\u2019s image, and ultimately failed to have any purpose to exist any longer than one measly release day. It\u2019s such bogus, regurgitated garbage with no character except that of its infamy. It\u2019s laughable, primitive, and incredibly embarrassing to have this thing clinging to your legacy, and it\u2019s tough shit that Tom had to give up on the creative control to ease the burden with the band and the record label. \n\nMind you that I\u2019m not even that big of a Celtic Frost fan, nor was I there to be betrayed by them, but I\u2019ve heard Zarach \u2018Baal\u2019 Tharagh demos I\u2019d consider just a hair above this (I\u2019d still take this over those, though). Going back to \u201cCherry Orchards,\u201d we see everything that\u2019s wrong even for glam rock. For one, the music video is atrocious and incredibly fake \u2013 poodle-hairdos flailing from guys who look like blue-collar moms in clothes that\u2019d make Vanilla Ice turn tail and run. Tom, while never really that great of a vocalist, really sounds like a retard. I\u2019m not sorry that I have to use that word to accurately describe these vocals \u2013 he\u2019s literally eating and whining his way through the song \u2013 and he\u2019s putting effort into doing them properly like he needs to get the style down correctly. This, plus the addition of those dull, meandering, inert female vocals will make any man go limp in a second; plan backfired there, Amberg.\n\nThe riffs run together pretty quickly and no urge arises where you feel like listening to these songs again. It\u2019s catchy, I guess, but nowhere near the level of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce or most any other heavy metal / glam rock band. Warrant\u2019s \u201cCherry Pie,\u201d as much of a bullshit waste of imagination that song happens to be, stands tall and mighty over this album. These Cold Lake riffs don\u2019t have any real hook to keep you interested, and the rest of the band members don\u2019t do much to spice up the songs. Bass is one thing, but to have a piss-poor back-up plan like bashing cacophonous drums and a zombie on vocals doesn\u2019t sound like a back-up plan I\u2019d be comfortable with. The rest of the solos on the album are squeaky and too sharp compared to the dry (structure and) music, but none of them compare to \u201c(Once) They Were Eagles\u201d \u2013 the only thing all these other solos spiral like is shit spiraling down the toilet. Those drums are the real coffin-nailer, though; the hollow snares are so unbearable and similar beats constantly dominate the patterns.\n\nThe guitar tone itself gets old quickly \u2013 this dehydrated tone with no power or resonance that represents the shallow songs they serve. \u201cLittle Velvet\u201d builds up overwhelmingly at the start, but by the time Tom\u2019s vocals grovel their way into the mix the whole thing is finished. The pop structure and exact same formula for each song (except the intro, which is abysmal anyway) has no method of persuasion and bores me to death, which is odd since most pop songs following this formula end up being catchy enough to keep me interested for another ten seconds.\n\nJust stay away from this \u2013 no real good can come out of it. You might enjoy one thing from it (maybe), but it\u2019s not worth the time and energy when you can be listening to any of the band\u2019s other albums or pretty much damn near anything else. Shit, just check out early M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and W.A.S.P. for some real killer heavy metal that wipes the floor with Cold Lake.\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost has gone through a myriad transformations, and up to Into the Pandemonium, everybody seems to know their works, and have a solid opinion on every album. Cold Lake, deserved or not, seems to be the retarded little brother chained in the attic among the full-lengths, and even if it still does a lot better than the average Poison or Cinderella wannabe album, it is the universally loathed unsuccessful sell-out album. Monotheist is the ruthless and musically rather successful comeback album, and for a lot of Celtic Frost fans, the only album they have personally seen and experienced upon release. The rest is too old for an eager young metalhead to remember, and as the unnoticeable follow-up to Cold Lake, Vanity/Nemesis is easy to skip and forget. \n\nIndeed, Vanity/Nemesis is the forgotten Celtic Frost album, and it definitely needs more attention in the grand scheme of things.The music on the album is not easy to define. There are few doom or black metal elements, but simply calling it thrash or heavy metal does not work on any level, either. Perhaps slowish thrash, with the locomotive riffing underneath the rest of the music, is the closest descriptive term available, but it conveys the wrong idea on its own. There may be some gothic ingredients in the stew, but again, simply tagging the album \"gothic metal\" is completely wrong. Some parts have a barely perceptible touch of 80s progressive metal in them, but generally the music is almost impossible to categorize in simple terms. And that, people, is the magic of Celtic Frost.\n\nThe album is a good one. That much is obvious. The metal is driving like a train, and the guitar tone is a pleasant compromise between the old Celtic Frost dental drill and the definite 80s metal crunch. There are occasional female vocals by someone called Uta G\u00fcnther, and while they may well sound extremely grating, juvenile and irritatingly punkish on the first dozen or so spins of the album, they are something worth tolerating until you get used to them; once they become a part of the music in your mind, the album wouldn't work without them. People say that beer is an aquired taste, but there are those of us who would not want to be without it, either, and while an operatic voice would have been an easier and more obvious choice, the relatively boorish and unsophisticated voice might well have been a conscious detail of dissention, chosen on purpose.\n\nThere are whispers, a few scattered solid thrash parts, and Tom's trademark vocals, and if the listener sets his ears on the regrettable \"analytic\" mode upon the first track, it's simply and purely human to look for glammy parts, some contemptible carry-on luggage from the allegedly loathsome Cold Lake times. There is little of that, but it is easy to think that the sound, the easier and more comfortable listening experience than on most Celtic Frost albums, is somehow legacy from the glam abomination. Vanity/Nemesis, unlike most other Celtic Frost albums, works as background music for certain activities, and while the rest of the band's discography demands attention and breaks concentration centered on other tasks, this album has a unique character: it is simply inoffensive to a higher degree than any other Celtic Frost pieces of art. Glam this isn't, and definitely not as dissonant in nature as the average Celtic Frost album, either... that is, if there ever was an \"average\" Celtic Frost album to begin with.\n\nIn the end, the music may technically be whatever it is, but the final verdict must be based on the experience and feelings the album leaves in the mind after the final track ends. And here the almighty Celtic Frost surpasses the expectations set by the technical dissection and analytical theory of this odd album. There are undercurrents, emotions and a strange brand of grimness in the music, and the experience is certainly more than the sum of its parts... once again. This is what Celtic Frost does best, and has always done. This time, however, the tools and methods used are not simple aggression and abrasion, or reckless avant-garde reconnaissance of uncharted territories, but rather refined and even amicable metal of somewhat indeterminate brand. The precious musical steak is hidden under the combination of perfectly executed riffing, doubly crass vocals, and ingenious songwriting. There is more to this than what can be read in the guitar tabs of the songs. Vanity/Nemesis is the forgotten Celtic Frost album, and while it may be mediocre on the scale set by the band's other masterpieces, it certainly has the merits for more attention than what it gets.\n\nThis is a fine album that would have plenty of renown, had it been written by some other band. Among the works of Celtic Frost, this is just the album between Cold Lake and splitting up. Unfortunately.\n",
        "\nIf you spend more than a few seconds reading up on Celtic Frost, you'd assume Vanity/Nemesis is a return to form of Celtic Frost without hearing it. Nobody has yet bothered to explain or confirm this though. The album doesn't get much attention or discussion, and is a taboo because of it's placement in Celtic Frost's discography. Almost anyone could express their disappointment in the album prior, Cold Lake, but Vanity/Nemesis seems to have been produced at such a poor time, that both negative and positive feedback for the album was abortive. This album may have managed to exist as the prime example of neglected music. A return to form would have caused much more feedback, as would a confirmed sellout. On one note, this is not a return to form. Vanity/Nemesis does not impose the darkness and energy of previous albums, and Tom's \"whining\" vocals are still present. On two contrary notes however, Celtic Frost remains Celtic Frost, as their \"perpetual changing\" from album to album is still present, and the manner in which V/N was presented, is also not as extreme as Cold Lake. V/N is not a glam metal album, but would more properly be labeled as a progressive heavy metal album. Some would consider this as much of a sellout as glam metal, but I would not be a part of that group.\n\nAs we start spinning the album, we get one fun little tune after another. None of these come off as bad, but not the best of CF's work. Each song gets progressively slower though, but this is by no means a bad thing. Wings of Solitude for example, is a beautiful and track including female vocals and acoustics. There are two or so tracks after that that feel similar, and could be excluded though. The band picks up on this, and gives us some speed with Phallic Tantrum, and A Kiss or a Whisper. The latter track is the easiest to connect with CF's previous work. We hear d-beats in the drumming, and even the CF styled \"mini-march\" writing. The title tracks come up, Nemesis, being my favorite. It was the only long track on the album, and throws in lots of twists. Not much can be said about the rest of the album aside from the album ending well. Again, nothing bad, but nothing astounding. My conclusion was that there was no real reason to hate the album, aside from perhaps not meeting the expectations set by CF before. The only fair criticism I must give, is that 12 tracks is too much. Perhaps if this stood alone, as a debut for a progressive heavy metal band, my standards would be higher. V/N has been held back far too much for where it's been placed.\n\nI don't wish to say this is for Celtic Frost fans only, but this is by no means the proper album to be introduced to CF by. There are still plenty of new tracks to be discovered in this album, return to form or not. Most people would have preferred CF to die after releasing Cold Lake, instead of trying to recapture themselves, though I believe they succeeded in doing so. It is undeniably a work to be considered. The band wanted to release it for a reason: it's an album of much effort and should be treated as such.\n",
        "\nIt is a very sad fact that when certain non-informed metal fans are asked about Celtic Frost's second EP \"Emperor's Return\", the collective response is a very loud and infuriating \"What?\"\nWhile that response may cause true metallers to tear their hair out in frustration, cooler heads will find it quite understandable. After all, \"Emperor's Return\" was often released in tandem with \"Morbid Tales\", therefore fusing them into one album. However, it should be noted that this second EP by itself is a standout contender. While it may not have the instant classic status of \"Morbid Tales\", \"Emperor's Return\" is still able to capture its fair share of attention.\n\nThe music itself is done in the traditional early Celtic Frost style, which means a plethora of crushingly heavy riffs mixed with faster guitar work. Opener \"Dethroned Emperor\" is about as heavy as Celtic Frost ever got. From the opening riff to the guitar solo to Tom Warrior's sinister vocals, this song encapsulates Celtic Frost like few others do. \"Circle of the Tyrants\" provides a bit more variety but is ultimately eclipsed by its slightly longer (and better) version on \"To Mega Therion\". Still a good example of how songs evolve over time. \n\nIt is strange to see the song \"Morbid Tales\" on \"Emperor's Return\", especially when that song was not on the original pressing of the \"Morbid Tales\" EP. Despite this anomaly, the song rages, and includes that classic line (Are you morbid?) \"Suicidal Winds\" and \"Visual Aggression\" also follow the same blueprint of downtuned thrash with catchy riffs.\n\n\"Emperor's Return\" is essential Celtic Frost despite its obscurity when compared to titans like \"Morbid Tales\" and \"To Mega Therion\". The music is first-rate and a must have for any CF fan, whether die-hard or casual.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s often puzzling how artists are when it comes viewing their work \u2013 though, I feel for the purposes of adding to his own ever-growing headaches, I should refer to Tom as an \u201centertainer\u201d \u2013 as Mr Fischer himself feels this is merely another step-up on the career ladder for his and Martin\u2019s band. But, of course, as a fan of his perplexing body of work I feel Morbid Tales to be the peak of their achievements. It\u2019s 1984, and this mini-LP or actual LP (depending on where you\u2019re located) has just rose itself from the warm, stinky corpse of Hellhammer; it\u2019s a time when the beast and beast-man in TGW\u2019s head are still fiercely locked in combat \u2013 ferocity or avante garde? Songs built on monstrous riffs or female guest singers? Celtic Frost\u2019s future was, as of yet, uncertain and it would be a few years yet till Tom\u2019s ruthless pursuit of \u2018bettering\u2019 himself artistically would prove the band\u2019s untimely undoing. \n\nWell, the success of Morbid Tales is, in part, due to the fact that it can teeter between both. Not so much avante-garde as it is une bande petite avante-garde (please pardon my French, and I\u2019ll pardon your garlicky smell). For every obviously looped screaming intro there\u2019s still a wonderfully atonal solo that reeks of an amateur trying to extend his skills beyond what he\u2019s capable of, whilst sounding all the better for it (or is that true of both?). Whereas Tom Fischer views Hellhammer as a noisy, juvenile fumbling of some inexperienced Swiss boys \u2013 often in a wholly derogatory manner that brings to mind the time when your parents would dismiss, say, Slayer\u2019s Reign in Blood \u201cbloody awful noise\u201d \u2013 this is clearly more focused, if still completely charming in its unique construction and execution; as despite his own inferiority complex no-one plays guitar quite like Tom. In both shrouded, gloomy metal in a way Venom never imagined and the more out-there sections it\u2019s a wonderfully complete listen, which never holds back on riffs that every self-respecting metalhead would want for Christmas. \n\nIt\u2019s perhaps funny that such a seemingly primitive album (from a musical stand-point, at least) achieves far more than Tom\u2019s own self-appointed Jewelled Throne, Into the Pandemonium. \u201cHow can this be my legacy?\u201d Tom would surely say in the depths of night (in between looking for hair-restoring potions in Swiss mens\u2019 magazines). I don\u2019t know about you, but the subtle variations in mood and the obvious if completely fantastic tempo changes in the songs here are a far higher art form than the \u201csecond-head made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9\u201d add-ons of Into the Pandemonium (don\u2019t get me wrong, though, I still like that album). \n\nOf course, I don\u2019t think anyone could argue that this is a truly amateurish attempt, I must stress that the lyrics are fucking excellent; there\u2019s not all too many Satans and hex-demons from the gates of Rotherham, but Tom Warrior (who, I feel, is a separate entity to Tom Fischer) and Martin Eric Ain craft some deliciously dark images. It\u2019s occult, evil stuff \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the 31st of October and children are asking for sweets but being given apples. If you needed a more obvious note of sophistication, which this record does possess in spades, look no further. It certainly goes a little deeper than the regular interjections of \u201cugh\u201d and \u201chey\u201d, all whilst being lyrically several steps above what most, if not all, English or American bands of the time were doing. In all, as a complete artefact from metal\u2019s grim and dank past it possesses both a grandeur and intensity that few could ever match. Peerless, really! \n\nAs for a personal favourite from this heavy metal smorgasbord of metal, well, I\u2019d have to go with the title track: A one-eyed beastie, morose and stone-faced upon its throne. It\u2019s the classic Celtic Frost sound but with a deceptive chorus riff that conveys more melody than it initially seems. A monument to everything that band strove for and a stunning realisation of everything metal can be. If that\u2019s simple then the next Satyricon album is going to be called \u201cYo! Satyr Raps!\u201d\u2026 Actually, that doesn\u2019t seem too far-fetched. Perhaps I should choose a better analogy? \n\nIt\u2019s funny just how far bands could go in the early-to-mid 80s with merely the original intent of being \u201cheavier than Venom\u201d, isn\u2019t it? And they certainly weren\u2019t done just yet. But, of course, how could you relate to such a thing? Pre-internet heavy metal just isn\u2019t your thing! It\u2019s not your scene, man! It doesn\u2019t match your perfectly sculpted eyebrows! Timeless music doesn\u2019t transcend the decades, no; it simply lays in its box and rots!\n",
        "\nI'll admit right away I've yet to see the film Citizen Kane, but every way in which I've heard it described, praised and criticized - as well as it's historic significance - correlates perfectly to C.F.'s masterpiece full length. Long, boring, monotonous, excessive, innovative, original, unique, genre-defining, classic. These are all adjectives that come to mind when discussing either work. The only real difference lies in the scope of each piece's influence. But is influencing the entire extreme metal world really that far from influencing the entire world of film? I like to think not.\n\nWith this album Tom G. and friends really refined the Celtic Frost sound. With these guys every album is like a new band, and I believe that's how Tom wanted it. While Morbid Tales (which I consider more an album than an ep) showed more avant-garde tendencies and thrashing than their previous work in Hellhammer, the raw, youthful and evil energy remained. All that happened was their songs were intricately structured and their musicianship was greatly honed. On \"To Mega Therion\" they left their youthful energetics behind and concentrated on furthering their art, and hence that of every extreme metal band to follow.\n\nThe crisp, clear production on this record gives the music a cold and crushing effect. In the intro you instantly hear that every instrument has piles of reverb on it. The guitar tone is less dirty than on \"Tales\" but much thicker and damn sludgy. \n\nThe opening instrumental feels like a great weight being dropped on you, that of all the world's pain and suffering. Once you've accepted this weight \"The Usurper\" knocks you flat on your back and begins dragging you on a tour through mankind's downfalls.\n\n\"Jewel Throne\" shows the sorrow that comes with decadence and the rapid road to destruction it leads us on. The \"Dawn of Meggido\" is the apocalypse and with heavy fucking doom riffs and atmosphere the Frost paints the barren landscape for our obliteration. Flawless. \"Eternal Summer\" reminds us of buried kingdoms, one of which we've become. Top notch thrashing is had in the after-world and Tom's solo evokes the burning clouds he speaks of in the lyrics. \n\n\"Circle of Tyrants\" kicks off side two by re-iterating that all is lost (in case the first five songs didn't give you that message). However, humans go on, in total ignorance of the past and rape of the earth and each other. This song makes you wonder if this album wasn't just Tom having a \"heavy-ass song\" writing competition with himself. \"(Beyond) the North Winds\" is a personal fave for that sweet opening riff and the, perhaps, more sublime lyrical content, with just enough nihilism on top. Did Tom even know what he was saying when he wrote \"Fainted Eyes\" (\"the waters grow dumb\"!)? It's a good thing this song is heavy as fuck too.\n\n\"Tears in a Prophet's Dream\" keeps with the great tradition of freaky avant-garde ambient track right before the last song on the album. And what a song. I don't know about everyone else but the one thing that excited me most about getting this album was hearing \"Necromantical Screams\". I knew this had to contain riffs from \"Buried and Forgotten\", that crazy Hellhammer song. And this one so out does it! This was surely one of the heaviest. darkest, doom-i-est songs of '85. And just like everywhere else on the album, the use of female operatic vocals is wonderfully enhancing. \n\nC.F. really took a more unique and direct tone on this album, dropping all occult imagery for their overwhelmingly bleak apocalyptic visions. Few albums have since captured these sentiments as poetically, if any. \n\nThe true beauty of Celtic Frost lay in their other-worldliness. It's very hard to believe that this stuff wasn't written/played by some grimacing sentient beings, like Lovecraft's \"Older Ones\". Or maybe just Lovecraft himself, although I highly doubt he could touch any riff Tom G. Warrior wrote. \n\nDon't come to this looking for \"Morbid Tales II\", but DO NOT ignore this album. Thomas Gabriel Warrior was arguably the most important guitarist to extreme metal in his reign and this was his masterstroke. I'm certain that the Celts only got their Frost back on \"Monotheist\" from listening to their old records, this in particular. This album managed to write the rules for all black, death and doom metal to come without following any of them. Warrior saw heaviness as a momentous force in modern music and he never followed any trends because of this. \n\nBUY OR DIE! and give \"Into the Pandemonium\" and \"Vanity/Nemesis\" a chance too. \n\n\"THE FROST, IT BITES! YOUR INNER HEART.\"\n",
        "\nFor what it's worth...My feelings on the Frost reunion. Firstly, this is one of my favorite bands. Has been ever since I bought my vinyl copy of MORBID TALES with the lyric poster. In all frankness it was a fetish object for me in '84, as were their next few releases. As much as I loved death and thrash metal in general, CF always seemed in a state above the scene. Sodom, Kreator, Onslaught, Destruction, Possessed and many, many more were all great, but CF was something else all together. An enigma, a religion, a universe unto themselves. \n\nAnd then came the experimentation, the let-downs, the break up and the long whispered rumors of reformation. During this time we read interviews in which Tom Warrior laid himself out as an arrogant prick, pissing on the old school metal fans who supported his art, wanting to believe his work was part of some larger esoteric tradition. We absorbed this and decided that if Warrior didn't want us anymore, we certainly didn't need him. He hadn't put out anything worth getting excited about in some time, so let him disappear up his own ass for all we cared. But suddenly the Frost reunion got more serious, and the rumblings were that it was going to be something special. Warrior (and Ain) seemed to rekindle their passion for metal, even to the point of finally saying vaguely nice things about Hellhammer! You could say they were merely trying anew to curry favor among their expected buying public, and you could be right. Time will tell if their passion remains after it has ceased serving their needs. But this was the band that gave us MORBID TALES, TO MEGA THERION and INTO THE PANDEMONIUM. Whatever their reasons for being back, and whatever their motives, I had to hear their latest work. \n\nFact: this is a doom-laden, dirge ridden album. It features a lot of slow and similar material. But for me, a huge fan of Moss, Electric Wizard and Skepticsim, this is not a problem. I find it odd that in a day when ultra doom, drone doom and funeral doom ae in vogue, why Frost should get so much heat for experimenting with the style. Expect an old school thrash record (ala THERION or EMPEROR'S RETURN) and you will be let down. But Frost never promised us a thrash album, or anything else specific for that matter. The sound, captured by Peter Tagtgren, is thick and black as mud, and a worthy lesson on how to produce a modern metal metal album. Clarity is in abundance, but so are unspeakably ebony guitars, sub-sonic bass tones and thundering, booming drums. \n\nThus, this dark, cynical, intellectual and affecting record sprawls itself out over us, through fairly straight forward tracks (\"Progeny,\" \"Ground\") more ambitious but still extremely heavy work (\"A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh,\" \"Obscured\") into \"Ain Elohim,\" one of the more frankly apocalyptic lyrics and potent musics this band have ever created. Then there's the three part Triptych that closes matters, which at 23 minutes total may be seen as some sort of pinnacle to the Frost mountain. But the first part, basically Ain intoning dire words in Gollum-like accent is a waste of time. The 14 minute centerpiece is excellent though, a long, strong epic both atmospheric and brute. By the time the mournful strings that make up \"Winter\" arrive, it's hard to imagine listeners, Frost fans or not, failing to be at least somewhat moved by this album. \n\nTo say I was skeptical about this album would be a vast understatement. When most bands reform, it's not because they have anything to say to us, either lyrically or musically. But Frost do and that's why MONOTHEIST matters. But as with every Frost record, please do not go into this with any expectations. Many of the low ratings I see mention how this record wasn't what the listener had hoped for or was planning on hearing. It's not as diverse as PANDEMONIUM, it's not as \"death metal\" as THERION, and it's not the kind of commercial thrash of VANITY. Obviously it isn't even on the same planet as A COLD LAKE. If anything it recalls MORBID TALES or even APOCALYPTIC RAIDS, only this time delivered by adults with years of experience behind them and that maturity shows. And I don't believe the press is simply bending over backwards for MONOTHEIST for the sake of it. I'm a bona fide CF fan from their earliest rumblings, and despite their troubled career and our troubled relationship as fans to this legendary band, I feel it deserves all the accolades it gets. If they give us another album as good as this one, perhaps it will quite some of the naysayers down a bit. Nah...it'll probably just piss them off more. Serves 'em right.\n",
        "\nTo Mega Therion, the first full length by Celtic Frost, a band whose influence and significance in the extreme metal scene no one can question or deny. Alongside bands like Slayer and Venom, their contribution to the genre is the most notable and cardinal. \n\nIt\u2019s just amazing how anyone can come up with such acrimonious and apoplectic music and still not look dry or repetitive. Thomas Gabriel is a riff machine; he comes up with such demonic stuff and gives new tunes out like he\u2019s running a shop. Another reason why this is not like those monotonous thrash albums is the frequent tempo fluctuations and alternations which help in capturing the essence and feel of this album. Not only has this pioneered thrash, death and black, its doomy sections are worth a mention as well. \n\nThe one minute opener is like a chilly warning for the storm of madness which follows it. It gives a glimpse of the dark and gloomy nature of this release. The sheer ferocity of their relentlessly violent yet artistic music manifests and exhibits their talent & competence. Every single song following the one minute \u201cmood setter\u201d is evidence of their skills and expertise. But the last track, Necromantical Screams, is the evilest of them all. You find yourself caught in the nefarious atmosphere, possessed by its power, obeying its orders, for it is a force so divine, you are worthless in front of it. All you can do, and all you should do, is follow it.\n",
        "\nThe first full length release from the band that was formed from the ashes of the raw, part-hokey, part-disturbing Hellhammaer represents a clear shift in style and sound. Far more professional than their earlier incarnation, Tom G's trio recorded an album that has a definite focus, development and execution. Despite that it is impossible to deny a certain thematic continuity that identifies this as a successor of Apocalyptic Raids. // \n\nThe production is less raw just and that description is true for every aspect of this release when compared to Hellhammer. At the same time, it is far removed from the slick, polished finish one would expect from modern power metal bands - a grainy, muddy sound is a constant accompaniment in the background. The guitar tone is heavy, bludgeoning and dominant throughout the album. I cannot overemphasize the aggression that makes a strong presence in every song. In that regard, it has moved ahead from their previous effort where the songs were uneven and relied heavily on the eeriness and shrieks. Talking of which, this album has no dearth of atmosphere and darkness or screams and grunts. While the bizarre, unearthly bells, screeches, howling winds and various unclassifiable sounds of Danse Macabre are the most extreme in this regard, the others have a powerful, intense sense of dread, horror and primeval expression. The general pace is slower than most contemporary thrash outputs, but the most distinct moments are the bass-heavy, thick guitar-riffs in slower segments. Thrash breaks can be heard in almost all song and they are used very effectively in a manner that complements the overall mood of the album. The guitar solos are short, atmospheric and adds to the grim, bleak and hopeless aesthetics. Standing on their own, these solos would not be particularly imaginative, but they could not be more in sync with the songs. The drumming is good and maintains the pace and aggression while providing a sense of structure to the songs. // \nIt comes as little surprise in hindsight that this was an extremely influential album which eventually heralded a whole new genre that was later explored to great lengths over the next several years. It is hard to think of another band that created such a dark art with a clear, topical focus both in sound and mood and yet managed to kick-ass( in the traditional sense) and not abandon the broad framework Heavy Metal.\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost is a great band, and Tom Warrior is one of the most creative guys out there as far as songwriting goes. However, you certainly wouldn't know that by listening to this piece of garbage. Not that you would be exposed to them through Cold Lake, as it has deliberately been skipped over when Celtic Frost's albums were all remastered, thus making it hard to find. Also, with all the rave reviews of Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion, compared to all the damnation this album has received (especially by Celtic Frost themselves - it was once even listed as an \"Abomination\" on their website instead of as an \"Album\"), it is highly unlikely that anybody would buy or download this lump of shit instead of one of their other albums. It is far more likely that somebody downloaded this album out of curiosity, wanting to see if this album is really as bad as it's made out to be. Now, this isn't the worst album ever made. This isn't even the worst \"metal\" album ever made. It is better than St. Anger (though definitely not by very much). However, it's still pretty godawful and is certainly ranks very low as far as metal albums go.\n\nFor those who have heard Celtic Frost before (and who hasn't?), try to imagine Celtic Frost playing an album of covers of hair metal songs after having had their balls crushed by sledgehammers on anvils (see what I did there?). If you can comprehend that, you should have a pretty good idea of what this album sounds like. The guitar tone completely lacks power, and for every potentially decent riff played there are about 15 totally forgettable ones (there are maybe 30 riffs on the entire album of 12 songs). The bass is somewhat audible, but it might as well not be because it adds nothing to the music. The drums are very unremarkable, except for the snare drum, which sounds like St. Anger's quieter cousin. Tom's vocals, however, actually have power... the power to make you want to puke just listening to them. Instead of the signature grunt he uses for Hellhammer and the other Celtic Frost albums, he uses an unbelievably obnoxious, nasal, half-shouted whine that is about as far from metal as you can imagine. It's pretty funny to listen to for a little while, but it ultimately leaves you with a feeling that you lost brain cells from listening to them.\n\nAfter the intro passes (which happens to be called Human, just like the intro on Morbid Tales, even though the two intros couldn't sound any more different), you are greeted with the two best songs on the album: Seduce Me Tonight and Petty Obsession. Each song has a riff that isn't 100% forgettable (instead being 99% forgettable). They also have solos that, in all honesty, aren't any worse than the completely unnecessary catscratch solos that are on a couple of early Celtic Frost songs. That said, these songs are still pretty bad, and if they're the best songs on the album, that must mean that this album is going to get really awful, right?\n\nWell, the next song is Cherry Orchards, which may very well be one of the most annoying hair metal songs ever written (including songs by Poison and the like). The shit-tastic riffs almost seem good compared to Tom Warrior's \"I'm trying to impersonate a child with down syndrome\" vocals, which are at the absolute worst on this song. But wait - that's not it! Once he shuts up, you're greeted to a pathetic attempt at being \"lustful\" with a female spoken word passage. Then, you listen to Tom sing again, then the same female bit is played, then you get a really shitty solo, then the song's over. The rest of the album isn't quite this bad (though Downtown Hanoi gets pretty close), but it is entirely forgettable and is a complete waste of time to listen to. One thing to note is that, in the middle of the bonus track Tease Me, the riff for Procreation of the Wicked is played for a few seconds. I found this to be in very poor taste - what are they doing trying to shit up that riff by putting it in an album like this?\n\nAll in all, this is a really bad album, even for hair metal. If you wanted to listen to it just for shits and giggles, all you need to do is listen to Cherry Orchards. Every other song on the album sounds the same (though not QUITE as annoying, and without female vocals), and listening to just that one song should deter most from wanting to listen to the rest of the album. Plus, you would only be wasting 4 minutes and not 45 minutes by listening to it (seriously, how the fuck can they make 45 minutes of shit this bad and repetitive?)\n\n8%, because it's better than St. Anger (which would be a 6-7%) and bands too bad to mention, metal or non-metal. That doesn't mean you should listen to this album if you have ANYTHING better to do.\n",
        "\nThis album is a colossus and a monstrosity. I should start by saying this was the first album to ever truly frighten me. Everything about this album made me fear for my life and what was beyond. I hadn't heard a single track off of this, before buying it. And in my normal fashion with an album I'm anticipating, I make an evening of it. I went to my room, shut off the lights, pulled the shades, put on the album and the movie Begotten on mute. Maybe rub one out first.\n\nBut onto the album. The first two tracks were a slab of Celtic Frost's particular brand of plodding thrashy genius. But it wasn't exactly what I was expecting from the avant-garde pioneers. They were heavy, to say the least, but they seemed a little played out, and I started to get bored. It seemed almost formulaic for Celtic Frost.\n\nAnd then \"Dying God...\" hit. Oh my fuck. It crept up on me. Clean vocals from Martin Eric Ain, and a simple, slow, reverbed to hell clean guitar melody. It picked up and picked up and I started to get frightened. Then the distortion kicked in on that one HUGE chord. Let me say that this riff consists of no more than 2 chords, but it is the most abusively, crushingly heavy thing I've ever heard. It roars through the room like Cthulhu rising from the ocean. The screaming, shrieking vocals display utter angst and helplessness, something we haven't heard from the normally tyrannical vocals of Tom G. Warrior. It was almost like Celtic Frost's way of saying \"WHOOPS, GOTCHA THERE.\"\n\nNext comes the ambient, and eerie \"Drown In Ashes.\" It's slow. It's simple. It's not nice. The female vocals, while beautiful, sound like something just isn't quite right. And I fucking love it.\n\n\"Os Abysmi Vel Daath\" Perhaps one of my favorite tracks on the album. For a very simple reason. The vocals. Here, laid bare, we are given the most dead-sounding, hollow vocals I've ever encountered. Hearing him, really just speak in time with the plodding heavy riff and the bizarre wailing in the background, chilled me to the bone. He sounds, to me at least, like a rotting corpse, a ghoul, speaking of his spiritual depression from beyond. And of course, the ever-present \"UGH\" of Warrior. And, before the music comes back in at 2:36, we are treated to an almost gurgling groan. Absolutely CHILLING.\n\nObscured seemed to me to just be a continuation of Drown in Ashes, with drums. But this track is the most hopeless, desperate track on the album. With the helpless repetition of \"No\" over and over, ad nauseum, it brings to mind a man who has been so physically and emotionally scarred, that he can do nothing but hope that his begging will do something to relieve it. But it doesn't. And at around the 4 minute mark, in comes this slow, ringing, MONOLITHIC riff. 3 chords. And it is a MONSTER. It hits like a tidal wave.\n\nI'd like to say that Domain of Decay is the only problem with the album. The song itself is fantastic, but I think it gets in the way. If it had been put somewhere else on the album it would have been better.\n\nAin Elohim. Of course. The Nietzschean blasphemy with a Celtic Frost twist. The high point of the track, near the end Tom's tortured screams give way to the next track.\n\nTottengott. Celtic Frost has summoned something from the other side. After listening to this track, I had to take a break from the album, or I was going to do something very drastic. I don't even want to talk about this song other than to say that it is fucking terrifying.\n\nSynagoga Satanae. Oh boy. My favorite. 14 and a half minutes of doomy, thrashy black metal. Featuring vocals by Satyr (I believe) the song is based around the mighty heretic, Tom G. Warrior, roaring, like pharaoh at his slaves. This man's voice is tyrannical. The music is bizarre, and ever-changing. Truly an experience.\n\nWinter. The culmination and climax of Celtic Frost's career. It's simple. It's beautiful. It's melancholic. Perhaps the most melancholy track in circulation today. The dust has cleared from the battlefield of the last 2-3 tracks. And everything, and everyone, is dead. Your family, your friends, your enemies. Everyone you've ever known is dead. Think about that when you listen to this. Then you'll understand. I've always believed that to understand, you had to hate yourself.\n",
        "\nThe great inexorable lapse of time and the events contained within it can do odd things to the perception of musical craft. When one listens to \u2018Morbid Tales\u2019, the seminal release of Swiss pioneers Celtic Frost, and compares it to many of the releases than came hence from then on, the benefit of hindsight lends the milestone release an enormous degree of historical importance within metal \u2013 it\u2019s relative uniqueness and influence are absolutely irrefutable.\nThe same can be said for \u2018Monotheist\u2019, the (as of this writing) final recorded work that Celtic Frost may ever produce with Tom G. Warrior at the helm. Since the band\u2019s dissolution, listening to \u2018Monotheist\u2019 becomes a far more emotionally intense and absorbing experience. To hear it is to see within the mind\u2019s eye the band carving upon their own graves their final epitaphs, fading into the shadowed ether with the records funeral cry ringing out mournfully from the black abyss.\n\n\nBut that, be assured, is only one aspect of \u2018Monotheist\u2019, one that has only been heavily amplified by the band\u2019s own personal course. The funereal tone of the album does not hold exclusive reign, and on this, possibly Celtic Frost\u2019s most intimate and revelatory of releases, many ideas, moods, textures and feelings are presented forth to the listener, linked together by the unifying thread of the band\u2019s exploration of musical territory indebted greatly to gothic and doom metal to create a remarkably unique piece of artistry.\n\n\nTo place \u2018Monotheist\u2019 into the aforementioned genres is to do it a profound disservice \u2013 the connotations brought forth by those simple words are in this case far too restrictive to adequately describe the work showcased here. The album is indeed one virtually saturated in the melancholic gloom of gothic metal, and the many slow, protracted, lingering and purely heavy guitar parts owe everything to the schools of the very best doom metal.\nCeltic Frost\u2019s unique stamp of experimentation, however, is all over the record. Consider the twin masterstrokes of the album: the astounding \u2018A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh\u2019 and the breathtaking \u2018Synagoga Satanae.\u2019 The two pieces mix an impossibly heavy sound with an extraordinarily atmospheric one; the towering riffs on display here, despite (or perhaps because of) their hideously effective simplicity, sound something akin to the unstoppable march of some great Lovecraftian horror, and yet they are offset sublimely with introductions, interludes and concluding passages marked by strains of sinister melody and ethereal textures.\n\n\nFor those seeking a purely heavy album, \u2018Monotheist\u2019 is perhaps not the album to explore, as only the double opening assault of \u2018Progeny\u2019 and the almost anthemic \u2018Ground\u2019 even approach the traditional concepts of extreme aggression, full as they are of pounding double bass work, rapidly paced riffing and what may even be approximated to a breakdown at one point. \n\n\nElsewhere, however, it is not simply the heaviness that impresses but the consideration with which the material has been handled. Absolutely none of the experimentation found here seems to have been included simply because the option to do so was available, and as such no idea ever seems unnecessary or overextended. The grieving violins of \u2018Winter (Requiem, Chapter Three: Finale)\u2019, and the beautifully haunting female vocals of \u2018Drown In Ashes\u2019 achieve maximum effect simply because they are used appropriately and fittingly, as does the band\u2019s very own performance, with every crashing strike upon the drums and gentle, careful pluck on a resonating guitar string speaking enormous volumes to the listener.\n\n\nIf \u2018Monotheist\u2019 is to truly be the final footnote upon the indescribably significant career of Celtic Frost, then it is one of the definitive landmarks of their long journey as innovators of so many facets of extreme metal. As much of a thought-provoking experience as it is a masterwork of ambience and atmosphere, \u2018Monotheist\u2019 is nothing short of a triumph.\n",
        "\nThis review is dedicated to the memory of The Celtic Frost, one of the forerunners of basically anything metal invented since the beginning of the 80's. The band is dead, and should you see it walking around, playing gigs or simply existing, it is not the real Celtic Frost, but a zombie-like animated corpse; only the return of Tom G Warrior can bring it back to the kind of unlife today's metal needs. Rot in Pieces, oh beautiful one. \n\nWhen asked, people's opinions on the location of the low point of Celtic Frost's career point invariably at Cold Lake, but whether or not there's a wider depression around the single glammy sinkhole is a matter of serious discussion. Depending on whom you ask, the slump may contain either Into the Pandemonium, Vanity/Nemesis, or even both. There are those of us who beg to disagree, and while Vanity/Nemesis certainly has its share of fans and also more than token respect among the less-fanatic fans of the band, Into the Pandemonium is a definite opinion-splitter of epic, Opethian scale. The album is a classic, a graphite grey granite tombstone to things that once used to be avant-garde, but the teeth of time have been gnawing it like a schoonerful of black rats.\n\nThe 80's was a decade of metal, synth pop, exceptionally ugly clothes (save for stone washed jeans, of course), Miami Vice and humongous silicone tits. Since Celtic Frost is definitely metal and not synth pop, the clothes on the non-hair metal crowd have always been rather sensible, and comparing Into the Pandemonium to Miami Vice would be unfair to both sides of the equation, we are left with silicone tits. And we are not talking about any tiny, cosmetic 2 dl additions that shape the bosom to a fuller hemisphere. No, Into the Pandemonium is comparable to those enormous, 80's silicone bombs that looked like a pair of overfed spherical piglets, have probably killed a few of their owners by blunt trauma to the forehead, and are most likely called, from left to right, Misters Wilson and Spalding, respectively.\n\nThe comparison is not a bad one. The enormous silicone boobs installed on starlets of the 80's have probably gone through a process of erosion similar to Into the Pandemonium, and both were children of their times. Both took things forward (a full foot, measured from the breastbone). Both have suffered, both are out of fashion in the way they were made in the 80's, and both still have their fans despite the opinion splitting. Both have also been unsuccessfully augmented later, and the results are worth lamenting. Let us take a closer look at the analogy, and dive deeper both Into the Pandemonium and into the cleavage.\n\nTo call Into the Pandemonium avant-garde by today's standards is a stretch. Any band trying to emulate the songs found on it are followers, not the advance guard of the art as real avant-garde is supposed to be. The album is 20 years old. But it certainly was avant-garde back in 1987, and Celtic Frost, upon releasing it, slammed a bold, brave manifesto on the centerfold for everybody to see. The hindsight of two decades can be a cruel way to measure the success they had, but to really see if they were the advance guard back then, the influence of the album must be examined.\n\nWhat were the new ingredients Celtic Frost brought into the metal kitchen in 1987? Well, the most obvious one is of course the use of classical instruments and clean female vocals in their songs, both to add doomy grandeur and to bring into the mixture a measure of beauty. Rex Irae alone shows so many new elements, with the distant horns echoing in the great caverns of Hell, the violins licking their ominously devilish sharp tunes, almost like riffs from a rack-stretched guitar, and the alto voice sounding like a pissed-off, voluptuous angel of retribution hovering above a procession of doomed souls staggering into Tartarus.\n\nThe other things, the original way to compose their songs and the intentionally and arrogantly pseudo-sloppy way to play their riffs, the vocals that are either whiny or tired depending on the listener's interpretation, and the simultaneously excellent and unrefined production that has certainly had its own tiny effect on the later black metal standards, are lesser, but had they been the only items on this album, they would have been big enough details to mention. They play the second fiddle to the glorious avant-garde here, however. And of course, there's the bizarre misstep, One in Their Pride, which was probably intended as a hardcore avant-garde shock item in the same sense as Danse Macabre on Morbid Tales was, but failed in a spectacular way. But to be on the leading edge means taking risks, and sometimes it means terrific failures, be they implants so heavily encapsulated in scar tissue that the mammaries look like WWII-era naval mines, or a whopping whole of two versions of One in Their Pride on re-released versions. Trial and error, and sometimes a pair of trials and errors.\n\nIn any case, in 1987, Into the Pandemonium was a bold album. It was the biggest pair of implants ever, and boy, did it catch the eyes of a few casual passers-by! The originality was unparallelled, the music was new, and the concept arousing. The two decades since have had their effects on the album, but still, a similar work has not been released. Knowing for a fact that a huge fraction of old-school metalheads have at least heard the album, and that a considerable part of that fraction has found it enjoyable, it's unbelievable that it still inhabits the niche it carved virtually alone. \n\nBut to get back to the issue at hand, the silicone boobs. The enormous rubber udders of the 80's have most likely lost their shape, and I bet that most of them have met the scapel a second time, becoming small, scarred titties again. Alternatively, they may resemble a pair of cantaloupes packed in the legs of a pantyhose, the said pantyhose being stapled to the owner's ribcage through the crotch part. Yup, they are paired pendelums of flesh, fat and synthetic joy for the truly depraved. Is that what Into the Pandemonium has become? Have we witnessed the gradual downfall of an enormous rack over the years, until the navel is located where the cleavage is supposed to be? \n\nThe answer is a definite \"No\". Into the Pandemonium is not the end result of two decades of wrinkling, stretching and aging on an artificial pair of funbags. It's more like the forgotten pin-up calendar from the year 1987 on the back of a garage: it shows its novel dating muscles in the shape they were when they still vaguely resembled the idea the scalpel-wielding insane architect had in mind when he cut the first incision and began forcing sacks of polymers between the real thing and the ribcage. It's a frame from the year it was made, and whatever has happened to the jugs in it afterwards, the picture is still there ...and, incidentally, most probably available for download somewhere on the internet for those who wish to find it again. \n\nIs it possible to enjoy the album afterwards? Can the younger long-haired dude appreciate the still picture of what once was, the virtual boobage that was new, insane and enormous back in the day, but now, even as a frozen, preserved moment in the musical pin-up calendar, looks  so 80's? Perhaps. No one can force a young metalhead to look upon the mountains of yesteryear with appreciation, but there will always be a minority that finds audial or visual pleasure in vintage things.\n\nPerhaps the two oddities discussed here can only be enjoyed by those who were around when they were, for the lack of a better word, erected. But tits never go out of fashion, just the ways they are displayed, covered and manipulated change. The metal evolution has had its share of dead ends, but the silicone monstrosities of Tom G Warrior were not one of those; Into the Pandemonium has influenced many things from behind the curtain in the strip club: there are doom bands with strangely familiar, grandiose songs that nod humbly to Rex Irae. There are symphonic black metal bands that owe something to the arrangements found on the album. Hell, there's Therion, playing covers of both Celtic Frost and Manowar, both live and on their albums, just to show their immense respect to the great old ones. Somewhere, right now, a bedroom musician is secretly trying on a custom-made faithful copy of Tom G Warrior's EEE-cupped bra, just believe me.\n\nInto the Pandemonium was and is a classic, and a construct different from anything done before it. Enjoy it or hate it, it had an enormous influence. Those of use who enjoy it will keep on finding new angles to view it from. Those who hate it... well, you just  might  be wrong. Just avoid the re-released versions, this album is one of those that have been spoiled by later editions; the original order of the tracks is perfect, and the additions on later versions do not fit the whole.\n\nWhat about the relationship of the reviewer and the silicone wonders of the 80's, you may ask? Doesn't, in the words of Josef Stalin, \"quantity have a quality of its own?\" Well, they never were my thing. Sometimes being natural beats any artificial enhancements. And in case you haven't noticed, the letters in \"melon\" can be rearranged as \"lemon\", and organically farmed lemons can be very, very good. Just don't tell my wife I told you that on the internet, she'd kill me.\n",
        "\nIf it is, it's not a funny one. Apparently people either love or hate this album. As you can see, I don't like it... it's pretty much a textbook example of how to NOT go mix genres.\n\nThe big difference from previous CF albums is that the influences from outside rock and metal are much more prominent now, for example there's some orchestral stuff too and a track named \"One in the Pride\", which is a hip-hop INSTRUMENTAL. It's more than that, though, it's a hip-hop instrumental about the moon landing. I wish I was lying. I really do.\n\nHowever, the attempts at combining genres are just plain half-assed. The dabblings with non-metal genres found on this album don't do anything else than confuse listeners who aren't so spectacularly pseudo-intellectual they think experimental music can't possibly be bad.\n\nOh yeah, there's an exception... the Wall of Voodoo cover, which is easily the best track on the album because it appears to have been written with another purpose than impressing music critics who are extraordinarily pretentious even by their profession's standards.\n\nThen we get to the songs that stick to the old Celtic Frost style that's not quite thrash, not quite black metal and not quite death metal either. They lack any of the energy or direction that \"Morbid Tales\" or \"To Mega Therion\" had, and it doesn't help that Tom G. Warrior's vocal performance sounds like he's totally bored. \n\nWhatever happened during the making of \"Into the Pandemonium\", the end result is... a bloated waste of effort that's mostly boring save for a couple of big \"what the hell was that?\" moments, and those are more annoying than amusing, and a nifty cover song.\n",
        "\nThis album generally gets a lot of praise for being a huge influence on the death metal genre and a classic staple of early \u201cbrutal\u201d thrash, which it is for the most part. However, in reality it doesn\u2019t really hold up to similar releases such as Endless Pain or even Apocalyptic Raids, which was belched out by practically the same band (except for name and drummer) that penned this slightly more elegant, yet less exciting release. \n\nGone here is the unrivaled murky guitar tone and so-bad-it\u2019s-good drumming of the previous effort of Mr. Warrior and co., and here to stay, for good or bad, is a much crunchier guitar tone and some drumming that is at least professional. The vocals are definitely unique, rooted firmly somewhere in the evolutionary process of the death growl, though they seem to lack conviction at times. This is probably due in part to the drunkenness of the lead singer or lack of sleep or something. Either way, the vocals could be better, but the fact that he butchers nearly every other word just makes it that much more enjoyable. Another very interesting characteristic of this guy, and therefore this album, is his tendency to throw in random \u201cEUGH!\u201d\u2019s in the song that usually lend a hand in ruining the evil primordial atmosphere that issues forth from the speakers. Although sometimes it is kind of nifty, it is completely overdone here. \n\nThe riffs on this album are decent, although there are not a lot that really stand out, except the main part of \u201cCircle of the Tyrants\u201d and the ending riff-fest of \u201cVisions of Mortality.\u201d My main qualm with the music and guitar-work of this thing, though, is the sameness of it. The riffs don\u2019t just sound the same, some of them are the same exact fucking riff. I swear. I call it the Morbid Tales riff. It\u2019s at the beginning of \u201cDethroned Emperor.\u201d It\u2019s in some parts of the title track. Not that it\u2019s bad, its just like a fucking virus or something. It is funny in a way, but the music suffers from this sameness.\n\nThe solos are nothing special really. They\u2019re just way too much whammy bar stuff and squealing. Of course they do have a lot of attitude and a decidedly demented bent. It\u2019s definitely better than the next album\u2019s soloing though.\n\nIf this album gets anything right, it is definitely atmosphere. The sludgy crunch of the guitar and the strange bark/groan of Tom really project the feeling of things forgotten, things not meant to be mentioned, dare I say\u2026 things morbid? And these guys certainly do it better and with much more personality than most black metal bands do. \n\nHighlights of this album include the menacing doom anthem of \u201cProcreation of the Wicked\u201d, the time changes and aforementioned awesome ending section of \u201cVisions of Mortality\u201d that surely influenced bands such as Obituary (just listen to the song Slowly we Rot), and last but not least, the mighty \u201cCircle of the Tyrants.\u201d \n\nOverall, what this album lacks in aggression and energy compared to other pre \u201986 extreme metal releases, it makes up for in mood and the outstanding obscure lyrics that were a definite influence on later bands like My Dying Bride. So if you are looking for some good early extreme metal or want to get into Celtic Frost, Morbid Tales is good for you. So go forth and prosper and listen to Morbid Fucking Tales or forever be a poser!\n\n(And never listen to Danse Macabre late at night!)\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost and Glam Rock are both things I know next to nothing about. My knowledge of Celtic Frost begins and ends with the one Hellhammer EP that I own, and my knowledge of Glam Rock is based entirely on the annoying-but-still-catchy strains that I hear on the radio all the time. 'Cherry Pie', 'Girls, Girls, Girls' and a few random Poison ballads. \n\nSo while my opinion on these two completely different takes on music are uninformed (to say the least), I don't need to know much to realize that they're effectively incompatible. Hellhammer was trashy, dirty and rebellious, whereas Glam Rock is all about being attracting the ladies and rocking out to some MTV-approved tunes. \"Perhaps,\" I thought, \"Perhaps Celtic Frost subtly changed their style over time, so it might fit well?\"\n\nAnd that is were this album fails.\n\nBecause as far as I can tell, this is effectively Hellhammer (played by much more skilled musicians) being squeezed, forced, hammered into a Glam Rock mould. And so it's not surprising to see that it fails on both fronts. The riffs are really, really quiet, and it would be an epic understatement to say that they're 'watered down'. They've been watered down until there's almost none of the originial content left- but yet, there's enough of the old sound to give the more glammy tunes a real sour taste in your mouth.\n\nAnd this, really, is where Celtic Frost let us down. Now if they had sold out and released a decent mainstream rock album (think: Metallica's s/t), then I would've been a lot more lenient. Perhaps a 50%. Instead, though, we have one of the worst glam rock albums- one of the worst albums of any genre- ever. Let's start with the vocals. It seems pretty clear to me that for a glam album to succeed, you need a good vocalist. One with \"attitude\". Now, I'm sure Tom G has that, but there is one thing he's lacking: vocal skills. Everything is just yelled kind of awkwardly, with no consideration whatsoever to catchy melodies (or staying in key for that matter). It's one of those rare performances that is both incredibly irritating and yet instantly forgettable.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the rest of this abortion. Pointless, incredibly boring thrash/glam guitar riffs that make you want to stick steak knifes in your ears, one of the most obnoxious snare drum sounds EVER, and annoying incredibly wanky solos. Oh, and the incredibly bad attempt at sounding sexy with the spoken female word bit in 'Cherry Orchards'. Damn, this sucks balls. This was so bad that upon hearing the first song, I thought it was a joke, a parody. But it doesn't seem to be the case, which is unfortunate. Failure on an epic level, AVOID at all costs.\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost... \n\nA band that broke the boundaries of metal and helped to create both extreme metal and avant-garde metal (and 'darky' glam rock). They were a great influence also to gothic/symphonic metal. It's simple: without this band, Metal wouldn't be what it is today.\n\nSo, here is their latest release (and comeback album): Monotheist. Flamed by some people for not being \u00b4Morbid Tales Chap. 2' or 'To Mega Therion II', yet, for me, it is a fucking great album, and one of the best comeback albums I've listened to.\n\nIt starts off with 'Progeny', mid-paced, yet a little faster than other songs, with really huge riffs. It reminds of Hellhammer in the tone of the guitar and the raw distortion. Then it comes 'Ground', slower, with only 4 short riffs being repeated again and again, yet sounding great and heavy. It also has some vocals and guitars effects that add diversity to the song.\n\nThen, we have a section of almost purely atmospheric songs. The album's only single, 'A Dying God Coming into Human Flesh', has one of the most simple yet most efficient melodies Celtic Frost have ever written. It somehow reminds me of what the melodies in 'Sorrows of the Moon' where in their time: simple, beautiful, and really dark. Also, the vocals of Martin Eric Ain are truly a plus to the song. 'Drown in Ashes' is a really good song, yet it has not too much to offer. Just Lisa and Tom singing with some backing samplers. 'Os Abysmi vel Daath' is good, but kinf od misplaced in the middle of a really soft, atmospheric section. 'Obscured' is very much like 'Drown in Ashes', just longer and thousand times better in instrumentation. Here there are much more guitars and percussion, and the intensity of the track keeps growing until the end.\n\n'Domain of Decay' is another great tune. Fast and aggressive, yet again it\u2019s a couple of riffs being repeated over and over, with effects to add variety. 'Ain Elohim' is just great, faster and more complex than other songs, it evocates much more aggression. The drum work really shines here, with double-bass and some occasional blastbeats here and there. It's one of the longest songs in the album, yet it doesn't become boring. The riffs are more complex and longer, and the vocals fit perfectly.\n\nNow, the Triptych. 'Totengott' is kind of a bridge between 'Ain Elohim' and the rest of the Triptych. But what a scary bridge! It is dark as hell, with Ain's vocals sounding louder and painful. The programming and sampler effects create a dark atmosphere that may scare the grimmest 'kvlt' kid.\n\n'SYNAGOGA SATANAE!!!'... What can I say about it? It's just one of the best songs ever written in Celtic Frost's career... and maybe even in the history of extreme metal. 14 epic minutes of pure fucking blasphemy and darkness!. It starts with percussions and noise, the real song kicks in as powerful as it is. I just can't explain this song with words. You'll have to hear it to believe what I tell you. I hope you get so impressed as I got when hearing Tom and Co. screaming:\n\n\"Rise! Synagoga Satanae...\nLies! Lucifuge Rofocale\"\n\nOr in the chorus:\n\n\"In Darkness, thou art mine eternally!\"\n\nThe final track, the long awaited 'Winter (Requiem, Chapter Three: Finale) is the concluding part of 'Rex Irae' from 'Into the Pandemonium'. It is a instrumental piece that spawns from the final notes of 'Synagoga Satanae', and it's oddly beautiful; good closer. This is by all means a great album, even if you are not yet a Celtic Frost fan (which is a weird thing, per se). A must have if you like dark and heavy music.\n",
        "\nAfter a long anticipated hiatus, the legendary Celtic Frost has returned to the studio and is shattering all the limits of the heavy metal world again. Let\u2019s go back twenty years to one the band\u2019s previous full lengths, Into the Pandemonium, first of all. The album was a strong statement and change of form that managed to pin an \u2018avant-garde\u2019 tag on the grimy surface of the metal world. That peppy, balls to the wall thrash metal outlook is long since gone.\n\nIn seventeen years, headman, Tom G. Warrior has cut his hair, and ditched his stage name. Fischer has risen from the ashes of Warrior and he has brought along a completely new style to Celtic Frost\u2026 gothic metal. While gothic metal is typically noted for its beauty and usage of heavy symphonics and alluring female vocals, this is not to be seen in Monotheist. Rather, Celtic Frost has chosen to yet again reinvent a prominent genre of music and reshape metal, as we know it.\n\nThe album begins with the spine tingling screech of Fischer\u2019s severely distorted and down tuned guitar before tearing into a powerfully deceiving thrash riff. This song is Progeny and is easily the most comparable to Celtic Frost\u2019s To Mega Therion days. The fast paced thrash music quickly dissolves to expose a far colder and darker core that the legendary band has never once touched on before.\n\nThe remaining tracks take the listener on a monster of a roller coaster ride with underlying ambience and precise instrumentals that aren\u2019t made to please the common person, but to rather aid in conveying this message of isolation and depression that the band has never been daring enough to express before. The album\u2019s only single, A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh, features eerie, but beautiful vocal work by bassist, Martin Eric Ain with an underlying repetitious melody by Fischer on guitar that quickly shatters the harmony just as it sustained it and breaks into a heavy, doom track. In addition to this single and the opener, Progeny, Monotheist delivers several ambient as well as punching doom songs that could almost bring the listener to their knees in fear.\n\nThe album at last closes with the fiendish three tracks dubbed the \u201ctriptych\u201d of the album (much in the vain of macabre artist, Heironymus Bocsh). First is Tottengott, which plays on heavy distortion and almost prayer like shouts by Ain. This track plays calmly into the real beast of the album, Synagoga Satanae, a fourteen minute long ride of pure paranoia and regret accompanied by some of the heaviest riffs on the album and even some German prayer chants by Ain. This track slowly breaks down and fades into the final blow, Winter which is a soft and melodic orchestral piece that is made to place the image of the dust finally clearing on the wasteland as the chaos at last dissipates.\n\nThe simple message that the album expresses on its own, without the aid of members\u2019 explanation is this: Monotheist doesn\u2019t care about anything but itself. This is a completely new direction for Celtic Frost, a direction that has proven that texture and atmosphere speaks louder than a catchy riff. It certainly takes an acquired taste, but that\u2019s precisely what the band intended from the start.\n\nFischer has matured (which is apparent by his shortened hair and rejected stage name), as have his lyrics. Celtic Frost has always been a band in the past to incorporate dark concepts of philosophy and history into their lyrical themes, but this goes completely beyond that and emphasizes the despairing, fragile individual. Loosely a concept album, Monotheist describes the despair in losing faith and turning to what you most hate, simply out of desperation and not definite belief. \n\nTo summarize, Monotheist is not for the typical fan of Celtic Frost and certainly not for the typical listener in general. Rather, Monotheist is there to pierce through the sunny exterior of your being and it wants to linger menacingly in your mind. It is isolated and cold and it wants the listener to feel the same way. While the tracks are generally slow paced and somewhat repetitive at times, the album makes up in sheer expressive quality and in carving a new name into the stone fortress walls of gothic/doom metal\u2026 That is Celtic Frost.\n\nThe living legends that rose from the ashes of the pivotal Hellhammer are back and better than ever. They\u2019re back in a far different sense and they want to see you quiver in fear. After years of anticipation, Celtic Frost has lived up to the hype and still stands tall as a truly unique and fresh metal band that doesn\u2019t intend on throwing in the towel yet.\n",
        "\nWith the revival of the Classic Goth/Thrash metal band Celtic Frost, we here at Heavy Metal Reviews thought it would be fitting to review their finest platter of music, To Mega Therion. Here you go!\n\nTo Mega Therion is a CLASSIC album if there ever was one. Casual thrash fans might find this album repetative, but those are the shallow/shit metal fans. This album delivers on crushing Slayer-esque blows and riffs that leave you wetting yourself again and again.\n\nTom Warrior's vocals are absolutely outstanding. They're the same type you'd expect from any Slayer album, but he sounds nothing like Tom Araya, if you can make that connection.\n\nThe album is heavy on gothic overtones aswell. Plenty of heavy, and I mean HEAVY thundering drums that seem to ring out into eternity. A couple Sabbath-esque riffs and Sab speed songs also keep you interested. The guitar sound is the exact same on all of the songs, but that just adds to Frost's signature sound.\n\nHard to believe this 3-piece band could put out such killer shit! (Then again, look at Motorhead, they're no slouches either!)\n\nThis truely is a classic and if you don't pick it up, you'll be missing out on one of the greatest thrash metal albums of the 80s. It ranks right up there with Master of Puppets (Metallica), The Legacy (Testament), Fabulous Disaster (Exodus), Peace Sells (Megadeth), and Reign in Blood (Slayer).\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost is a strange creature. The constant evolution of their sound, style and image has been incredibly successful, with just the Cold Lake era glam phase being usually mentioned as a mistake. They have treaded the paths of black, thrash, doom and avant garde, usually at the forefront, scouting new territories, never settling for less than their own, extreme vision. How on earth could Monotheist, with its reported mallcore influence, fit the picture? The question is easy to answer: Monotheist could just as well be called Monolith. It's huge, unforgiving, and ruthlessly original, and does not care about its surroundings; it just is, and it's magnificient.\n\nBefore beginning to explaining the greatness of this piece of art, the most pressing question to be answered is the alleged mallcore influence. The band uses downtuned guitars, the riffs are mostly relatively simplistic, the album is \"gothic\" for the lack of a better word, and there's angst in everything on the bass-heavy, distorted album. So, we are talking about Korn's gothic little brother, right? \n\n... right?\n\n...\n\n...WRONG!\n\nMallcore, itself an ambiguous, amoeba-like term with many simple explanations but not a single dictionary-worthy one, has been defined by listing many features. There's downtuning, teenage angst, turntables, rapping, hardcore influence, simplistic riffs more centered on the sound's texture than actual riffing, breakdowns, more image than content, and other less-important things. Of those listed above, we can find downtuning, but it's just an effect used today by many credible death metal acts. We can also find angst, but not the my-girlfriend-left-me-for-this-polish-guy-I'm-gonna-cutmyself-just-to-feel-sumthin sort of teenage garbage. No, the angst on Monotheist is existential, profound, philosophical and grown up. It's the kind of  Weltschmerz  only those who think too long and too hard upon the fundamental issues of the world, religion, existence and purpose can feel.\n\nWhat we have left of the list of \"mallcore influences\" are guitars more centered on the texture, rhythm and mood than on actual technical riffing. That's a more daunting piece of evidence to topple, but it can be shown that the origin, purpose and result of those guitars differ from their n\u00fc-metal equivalents. \n\nTo take a longer detour, let us talk about food. The world's cuisines are mostly centered on tastes. Sweetness, saltiness, bitterness, sourness, and, debatably, umami, are considered the basic foundations to build on. After the basic tastes, the olfactory epithelium takes over, and expands the experience by integrating smells and flavour. The sense of smell can multiply the possible tastes by millions, and expand the horizons of the experience thousandfold. The looks of the food are another point to consider, and to a connoisseur, the surroundings, the wine served with the food, and even the company, cutlery and background music can be important parts of the experience. \n\nTo a more brutal consumer, there is another factor to be considered, however. It's even more fundamental than the basic tastes, goes deeper into the predator's evolutionary history and sometimes outweights the flavour. At its best, it gives a more profound satisfaction that the tastes alone. It's the texture. The way the teeth must work to chew the food, the feeling of the grains on the tongue, the satisfaction of finally biting through the sinewy meat. Think about it. Do you like the crunchingly palatable but virtually tasteless squid? The crunchy piece of cartilage in the top end of the barbequed chicken's leg bone? Do you prefer the chewier pomelo over the grapefruit with its similar taste? Have you enjoyed the tenderness of a good eel sashimi without even noticing that the vicious wasabi had already killed your tastebuds? Have you eaten a calf's heart and enjoyed the pleasurable stringy toughness more than the mildly liver-like taste? Or simply kept chewing the gum long after the taste has vanished? If you have, you may have an inkling of the worth of Monotheist and it's basic, feral nature. It goes deeper than just riffs, melodies or lyrics. It's there, burrowing somewhere, and while the taste is that of dirty, rusty electricity, the texture makes it worthy.\n\nWhat Celtic Frost have done is exceptional. They have taken their basic formula, the very same as found on some parts of Into the Pandemonium, and first degenerated it into the most primitive basic components, then finished the whole with a few well-chosen touches of beauty and refined spots of bleak colour. Monotheist is more of texture, emotion and atmosphere than technicality, melody or riffs. To reach the intended texture, the downtunings and occasional simplicity were neccessary. The result is rude, ugly and primitive, but like a stony desert, it contains beautiful oases, an occasional ruin of a ancient palace, or the fallen and decrepit remains of the statue of Ozymandias. The ugliness and rudeness has a majestic quality, and the beauty on the album just serves as the polar opposite of the jagged gravel desert underneath.\n\nMusically, Monotheist is based on two factors: on one hand, the downtuned guitars playing slurried riffs mix and meld with Fischer's familiar grumpy vocals. On the other hand, there are spots of very beautiful melodies, an excellent clean-voiced female vocalist, strings and tranquil stretches. Contrasts abound and the two layers of the texture create the consistency Celtic Frost strived for. Any kind of sense of humour is completely absent, and the album is as serious as they ever come. The seriousness tops even that found on Into the Pandemonium, which is not a mean feat.\n\nThe \"gothic\" aspect of the album, often quoted in various contexts, is misleading. There are no romantic stories of the undead, no erotic tales of female vampires, no haunted house horrors. The atmosphere is bleak and melancholic, but at the same time angry and aggressive. Anyone looking for the kind of gothic metal that features operatic female vocals, whitewashed faces and a trickle of blood dripping from the rosy lips of a pale temptress can go and find something else. Monotheist is about bigger issues, it's all-encompassing and philosophical. Gothic doom is a mislabel, but like so many times before, Celtic Frost's specific genre is nearly impossible to name due to their originality. This may rather be the birth of a new genre than gothic doomdeath.\n\nThis piece of art will be imitated and copied, and hundreds or thousands of bands will be influenced by it. It's quite unlikely that anyone can reach the same artistic height, however; Into the Pandemonium, with its similarly original concept and execution, remains alone in its own category, despite its advanced age of two decades. There are not even credible pastiches of it yet, and the raw emotions expressed by its refined and occasionally symphonic sounds remain as potent as ever. Monotheist will have a similar fate: few will name it among their favourite albums, but it will be secretly revered by thousands, and influence and inspiration will be drawn from it for decades to come.\n\nMonotheist is not an easy album to understand. It's even more difficult to like. But if you wish to like it, you must do it on Monotheist's own rules; the album will not yield an inch to accommodate your taste. It stands there, tall and foreboding, as a Monolith is supposed to do, and doesn't care. Worship it, loathe it or ignore it, it's all the same. Monotheist will simply ignore you.\n\nIt took just six months for the Monotheist to move from the record stores' front shelves to the bottom of the cheapest bargain bins. It just serves as evidence of a tragic truth: mankind still does not recognize its own greatest creations.\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost pisses me off. They had so much potential with their first albums \u2013 and then they went with some progressive and doom influences and ended up being a watered down version of themselves. I thought with the reunion of the band, they might \u201crestart\u201d their career, if you will. Well \u2013 I should have known better.\n\nI will say that Monotheist isn\u2019t bad. It has some very interesting and redemptive qualities to it. It wasn\u2019t a return to thrash like I was hoping it would be. In fact, there is some very interesting song-writing and music present on this album. \n\nThe first two tracks had me going\u2026they were heavy, pounding, and evil sounding. I really like the first two songs on Monotheist. The rest of the album isn\u2019t so great for me. The best part of Monotheist (as a consistent factor) is the atmosphere. If there is one thing that Celtic Frost did well on this album was create a very scary and foreboding feeling. As I was listening to the album I had a feeling of impending doom the entire time. It was a strange feeling \u2013 but very impressive at the same time.\n\nThe music is slow. Its so doom filled that it almost isn\u2019t metal. Well, it is metal \u2013 but it is very slow and ambient. The guitar work is simplistic as is the bass and drum work. Granted all of the music does work on a purpose \u2013 which is to create an atmosphere. It may not be the fastest or heaviest but it does do its job. So I can\u2019t complain all that much. I prefer faster and angrier music.\n\nThe singing is accomplished in a variety of ways, the heavy handed and rough singing of Tom G. Warrior, a female vocalist, and a soft male vocalist. These different kinds of vocals are intermixed to create a variety of sounds. This is both clever and frustrating. It creates a variety that the music doesn\u2019t really do \u2013 but it also breaks up the atmosphere so that it doesn\u2019t always hold. \n\nThe lyrics are full of controversial topics. There are some topics of religion, death, and birth\u2026these are normal metal topics but when they are presented in the manner that Monotheist does \u2013 they seem a lot more aggressive. \n\nOverall, this album does its job. It creates a frightening atmosphere. It\u2019s not catchy and it\u2019s a difficult listen. It requires a lot of concentration and if you tune out at any time then the purpose of the music is lost. I really miss the old Celtic Frost. Monotheist is a fine album for some. But I have heard better from Celtic Frost.\n\nSongs to check out: Progeny, Ground, Domain of Decay.\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost has returned in true controversial fashion.\n\nControversy appears to be part of the Frost formula and is perhaps stronger today than it was at any time in their history. If you're looking for MT, TMT, or ITP parts 2 into infinity, you will be disappointed. CF is always about doing something so radically different and pushing the boundary of the type of music they are producing. They are different today, some 14 years after the close of Celtic Frost's incomplete and jaded initial history.\n\nThis album is heavy. What it isn't is easily understood. The guitars are primitive and brutal at points, but a soundscape and texture is provided that would deliver a seemingly primitive and brutal album into a complex album that leaves the listener wondering what happened over and over. I mean this in a good way. The guitars hark back to Hellhammer. Tom's voice is different, but brutal. He infuses the music and the listener with his rage, not only in voice, but with the brutalization of his guitars. Not only is there the rage, but one can see a more vulnerable side to Tom and Martin in such songs as A Dying God... and Drown in Ashes. Franco is brilliant and infuses the music with his style of extreme drumming. In my opinion, certain elements of music can survive from the past, but the drumming is something that has evolved so far into the speed and technical realm that it can't be substituted. Fans of Reed St Mark and Stephen Priestly will be proud. Franco also co-writes several songs. Songs like Temple of Depression and Domain of Decay are straight and to the point and brutalize the listener with rage, volume, and speed, not to mention the Warrior \"UGH!\". \n\nOf most interest to my was the three part, 20+ minute \"Tryptich\", comprised of the eerie Tottengott, Synagoga Satanae, and the conclusion, Winter (Requiem Part III). Tottengott is unearthly and also used to open the live shows. It again features Martin on altered vocals (first appearance on A Dying God with clean vox). \n\nThe packaging is incredible and costly with three distinct covers, as well as a poster.\n\nIn conclusion, this is Celtic Frost's best work to date. It gains from years of rage, dormancy, better production, and the Celtic Frost fire to forge into a foreign direction fearlessly, without regret. This is the first album that was all theirs, without influence of any recording executive with a desire to have them go in a more marketable direction. This simple fact produced a brutal, textured, and complex album composed of primitive elements that will please, as well as take time to understand.\n",
        "\nListening to this album is alot similar to eating a delicious fat laden meal. After eating such a meal you'll feel full; and if you're smart you stop eating. Some of us however are not smart and we continue eating until it feels like our insides are going to explode in a glorious shower of blood and intestines.\n\nWhat does this album have to do with dietary habits? Into the Pandemonium is like that delicious meal that could make you sick if you devour too much of it. I've had this album for a year now, and until now I could only listen to it once through. It isn't because the album is horrible, but because it literaly makes me sick. The tracks are so varied that it seems like Celtic Frost couldn't decide what style they wanted to play. Thankfully for this band they're talented enough to get away with mixing several genres that make absolutely no sense. (A good example is the song: One in Their Pride.)\n\nThis band has been heralded as the inventors of Avante Garde metal. Before that they were black metal, but apparently the members decided that was much too normal. \n\nThe guitar riffs on this albums are reminiscent of thrash and prog, but much more experiemental. When I say experiemental I don't mean that they played around with their guitar pedals to create some fucked up sound. No, it's more like they knew the rules of guitar playing and then broke them, but still made it sound good. \n\nIn fact let me blunt. They did this with all of the instruments. Studied them, and then broke the rules. Amazingly it sounds good for the most part. Highlights of this album include Mexican Radio; Babylon Fell; I Won't Dance; and Rex Irae.\n\nOf course this album has it's share of \"What the fuck was that?\" moments. The first moment comes in by the song, Tristesess de la Lune. A somewhat amusing songs that sounds similar to an average highschool musical with the main female vocalist singing. Interesting, but was it really needed?\n\nThen there's the two versions of One in Their Pride. An electronic hip hop song. Come to think of it one of the members of this band, (Tom I believe) is now always shown wearing a snow cap, and some weird corpse paint. Truth be told he looks like a grim, white rapper. Perhaps that and One in Their Pride is Celtic Frost's subliminal confession that they like hip hop. Nevertheless those two songs are like those Andes Chocolate Mints. Pretty nice, but not something you'd want to eat everyday. \n\nThis album would have gotten a higher score, but unfortunately Celtic Frost broke way too many rules. It's fantastic that they played a more unique style with the four main instruments of metal, but adding in a hip hop song and a high school musical song is just too much. \n\nRecommended for abstract artists, vanilla icecream lovers; and metal heads with a secret love affair with hip hop. \n\nNot recommended for normal people.\n",
        "\nAfter several listens of the intensive variety to this album, all I can say is this; all you folks who were expecting \"Morbid Tales, Part 2\" to make up for their long absence are stupid! If you know anything about the mighty Celtic Frost, you will know that they have never done anything that was expected of them. This of course has led to disasters like \"Cold Lake\". But this is about a million miles away from that travesty, and in fact is a massive kick in the 'nads and another to the head afterward from a band who still have lots to say and play, and this album proves that and then some. \n\nFrom the opening squeal of feedback and the slamming opening guitar/drum tandem that starts \"Progeny\" to the moody atmospheric ending of the \"Tryptych\", this album sets an incredible, eerie mood that shrouds you in oppressive atmosphere. And the guitar tone from hell has RETURNED and how, aided and abetted by being severely downtuned to B, sledgehammering your ears and speakers with merciless brutality in its simple riffing approach--you were expecting maybe Yngwie? Tom's riffs on this album are simple and connect with deliberate intent to cause maximum damage, and such is the case throughout. The only thing missing is his gloriously weird, burbling, gurgling solos, but I'm over that. \n\nMartin Ain's dense, woolly bass rumbles away underneath like a bulldozer, one of the best BASS sounds I've heard in a while, adding considerable weight and heft to the proceedings at hand. Franco Sesa is the best drummer they've ever had, too, incredibly tight at every tempo and an energetic player to boot with impeccable technique driving the thundering material along with unstoppable force. Makes Reed St. Mark sound downright clunky if you listen to this alongside, say, \"To Mega Therion\", like I have. Peter Tagtgren's considerable production expertise enhances the sound in a more subtle way than usual; this is not your typical \"Abyss Studio\" production. It's sludgier and darker, yet clear enough to get the point across with more than enough force. \n\nAnd best of all, Tom's vocals! He has returned to a harsh growling style that is more coherent than the olden days, yet still menacing. And his clean vocals have improved vastly, showcased on epic doom numbers like the back to back tandem of \"A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh\" and \"Drowning In Ashes\". No more weak, pinched nasal whining for him, he sounds far better than ever before in that realm. He conveys feelings of angst, sadness and depression most convincingly when he goes into clean vocal mode. \n\nThe lyrics are depressing as hell, too, with the usual occult themes surfacing, but with a more moody, sad, and wistful feel, as though to convey a feeling of \"I've gained all this power, but to what end? The price I paid was not worth it after all!\" He conveys the feel of an ancient god yearning for death and oblivion with these lyrics beautifully, in my opinion. \n\nThe music? Wow...deep waves of dark and saturated guitars sustaining morbid bent notes and crashing chords over plodding doom beats is how this album works its Will upon you, the listener, filling you with gloom and drawing you in with barbed hooks of fraying sanity. As I mentioned earlier in the review, mood and atmosphere are paramount on this album and thrash is out of place here. Even though \"Progeny\" is the fastest song on the album, it still fits in as an aggressive opener to open your ears up to the intensely powerful beatdown that follows with the slower and more doomy and deliberate material like \"Ground\" (with its grinding bass breaks), the annihilatingly slow \"A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh\" which uses repetition to good effect near the end, and the intense treatise on depression known as \"Drowning In Ashes\". This is not a samurai's razor-sharp katana slicing your arteries open before you know it, but an ogre's thick oaken club battering you into pulp slowly but surely. \n\n\"Os Abysmi Val Daath\" speeds up slightly, but slows down into doom mode again with a catchy and simple chorus. Haunting female vocals are used to good effect here and there and work because they are not abused; she fits in well and adds to the mood of the songs she appears on with her soft and soothing soprano croons. No operatic wails here, but that would be totally out of place anyway. Have I mentioned that this album is pretty damn dreary and depressing? The bridge early on in \"A Dying God...\" conveys the feeling of utter wretchedness of a diety being forced into a slowly decaying human shell after milennia of immortality to serve a demeaning death sentence in mortal form like you won't believe. \n\nThose expecting the endearing crudeness of the early works will be disappointed with the more sophisticated approach on display here. Or maybe not...listen without prejudice to this album and let it soak into your DNA before you make a judgment. I, for one, love it and count it as one of my favorite albums of 2006 thus far.\n",
        "\nObviously, it's not easy for a band like CELTIC FROST to release a new album after all these years. With so many jaded metal fans expecting a shallow cash-in or another 'Cold Lake' and so many die-hards simply wanting 'Morbid Tales part II' it must have been difficult for Tom G. & co to go ahead and make the music that THEY wanted to make. As it happens, they have managed and 'MONOTHEIST' is all the better for it.\n\nThe album opens with howling feedback signalling a return to a much harder brand of metal and the beginning of 'Progeny'. While immediately satisfying, the track seems to drag a bit and, while very heavy, is a tad directionless. All is forgiven when 'Ground' kicks in. Many fans will have heard the demo and rehearsal versions of this track on the band's website. The finished version is the best yet; a vitriolic expression of existential angst with the most brutal blood-'n'-guts guitar tone ever heard on record.\n\n'A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh' has a much slower pace to it and is somewhat reminiscent of early MY DYING BRIDE but with a distinct twist. 'Drown In Ashes' is an altogether more atmospheric track with haunting female vocals, subtle, yet powerful electronic musical textures and Tom sounding akin to Andrew Eldritch.\n\n'Os Abysmi Vel Daath' is another crushing doomy number enhanced by the addition of a french horn and the occasional death grunt (Uhhh!) in a manner which reminds us where they came from without the band sounding like a parody of themselves. The doomy, gothic number 'Obscured' has an altogether unique feel to it and really grows on you with each listen.\n\n'Domain Of Decay' will be familiar to anyone who has heard the band's 'The Nemesis Of Power' demo. Tom has taken the riff from 'Pearl Of Love' (arguably, the best thing about 'The Nemesis Of Power') and used it seamlessly in this old-school crypt-kicker. It serves as a bridge, almost, between the band's past and present. 'Ain Elohim' is another 'speed song' in the same vein as 'Progeny'. While not remarkable, is definitely listenable.\n\nWhere 'MONOTHEIST' really shines is how the tracks seem to lead perfectly into one another and nowhere is this better illustrated by the magnificent 'triptych' of 'Totengott', 'Synagoga Satanae' and 'Winter'. 'Totengott' is a magnificently atmospheric and uncompromisingly grim soundscape with Martin Ain providing vocals that sound like an angry dalek in the depths of the abyss. 'Synagoga Satanae' is an epic number and the highlight of the album. A brooding masterpiece which flows and metamorphosises as you listen to it. 'Winter' caps off the album giving you a chance to collect your thoughts as well as being a wonderfully minimalist yet moving piece in it's own right.\n\nI couldn't help but smile after the album was over; I found it very cathartic but most of all, I was glad that CELTIC FROST had delivered everything they'd promised and more. You may well have to listen to 'MONOTHEIST' more than once to get it's full effect; it's definitely an album that grows on you. Even if you didn't like it the first time, give it a chance.\n\nRather than just caving-in to 'fan' pressure and making another 'To Mega Therion', CELTIC FROST have, once again, shown themselves to be innovators and a band who, love 'em or hate 'em, you simply can't ignore. I'm proud to call myself a fan.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the epic 'To Mega Therion' a couple of years prior, Celtic Frost\nreturn with a much different effort, the experimental metal work 'Into the Pandemonium'. Firstly, I can live without much of the melodic vocal work, especially by T.G Warrior himself. The production for the heavier songs is similar to that of the last album, if not a bit more clear. The avant-garde stuff is well produced, and such epic tracks as Rex Irae are more lisenable\nthan if they were covered in static.\n\nThe guitar tone is still fairly thick, but this time around there are not as many killer riffs to back up the definitive tone, the bass is present but lacking punch, and T.G Warrior's vocals shine on the heavier songs, but are pretty hideous when he actually tries to sing. For me, the highlights of the album are the parts which are reminiscent of their earlier work, such as the crushing 'Babylon Fell', the fast paced 'Inner Sanctum', and even 'I won't Dance' is a pretty catchy track with some decent riffs. The shit really hits the fan on some of the melodic work though, as songs like 'Sorrows of the Moon' (and its French-sung counterpart) stink up the album with their sheer lack of anything aggressive or memorable, and the cover of 'Mexican Radio' is pretty mediocre, if not somewhat listenable.\n\nRex Irae is somewhat of an operatic metal track, but Warrior's moaning hinders the listen, as do the violins, which are right up front in the production. The riffs are buried under the strings, and while it can be considred 'epic' or whatever, it really goes nowhere until the last 30 seconds of the song. Oriental Masquerade is a bit better, just because it is instrumental and shorter, and actually would suit\nas a segue piece between two heavier songs. Shame that 'One in their Pride' is on here twice, and both versions are truly horrible, notably the completely unoriginal and monontonous breakbeats. \n\nSo yeah, this album is really nowhere as good as either 'Morbid Tales' or 'To Mega Therion', both of which are 90 point albums. While certain songs (Babylon Fell, Inner Sanctum, In the Chapel, in the Moodlight) are keepers, the poor avant-garde work on this album makes it a hard listen.\n",
        "\n\u201cAlluring children for his masses \nRobbing and buying young souls \nSacrifice to morbid demons \nSatisfy his repulsive sexual lust\u201d\n\nHearing that blaring from your speakers, from the first song gives you an idea of what this album is about.\nDefinitely groundbreaking, this came out right after Hellhammer broke up and kept up the tradition. Can this be better than Apocalyptic Raids? Yes it certainly can and it is. Cleaner songwriting, production, and maybe a tad bit more professional Celtic Frost\u2019s debut blew Hellhammer out of the water. A mixture of black, death, and old school thrash and not to mention the ultimate guitar tone. Listen to that tone of Procreation of the Wicked for a taste of that. Around this time thrash was poking its way into the metal world showing a deadly increase of speed. Along with that, Venom and Mercyful Fate were still planting the seeds of black metal with Don\u2019t Break the Oath. But Celtic Frost held an original sound that was somewhere in-between, mainly leaning towards the Venom sound. Another thing to add is that this album just isn\u2019t complete without the added EP Emperor\u2019s Return. It really rounds off the album, not to mention has the best Celtic Frost song ever, Circle of Tyrants. The only thing that brings the album down is the sometimes monotone moments that you start feeling by about track 6. But don\u2019t worry it isn\u2019t that bad, its still 84. Maybe around \u201887 is when that feeling started getting annoying, but here it\u2019s still fresh and brutal.\n\nProbably a bit terrifying for back then, Human is a short little intro of moans and screams that runs right into one of the fastest songs on the album and a great little piece of old school thrash, Into the Crypts of Rays. I was surprised when I heard this because all I had heard from Celtic Frost was their slow bludgeoning songs but this had plenty of thrashy type riffs and a nice chorus and goes in-between fast thrashy to midtempo, keeping things interesting. Also note the molestation on the drums from Priestly. \u201cVisions\u2026\u201d have always been a bit boring to me for some reason and is somewhat of a throwaway track.\nDethroned Emperor is more along the lines of what I expected from Celtic Frost, midtempo heavy as fuck metal. They throw around a good riff that first comes around 1:20 throughout the song. Listen to that guitar/bass sound, its completely menacing. This sounds something that upcoming doom/death legends would sit around jamming to. Next is the classic title track, Morbid Tales. It starts off slowly put picks up with a shriek from Tom G. Warrior and keeps up the speedy pace with a nice pre-chorus and the classic \u201cAre you morbid?.\u201d And then it\u2019s over almost as soon as it starts.\nOh god, such unholy guitar tone!!! Procreation (of the Wicked) kicks so much ass with that opening OUGH from Tom to that main riff to the crushing chorus. What the fuck at 3:30 how hardcore/necro is that, some distorted vocals about killing an old man in the background. What an ending. Return to the Eve is something a bit a different, which is not a bad thing\u2026 for the most part\u2026; its still gut-busting metal. They take a different approach on the vocals especially in the verses, leaving you with a few \u201cwtf was that\u201d moments. A nice solo thrown in there as well. Speaking of \u201cwtf moments\u201d they throw in this odd female sample toward the end that\u2019s a little unnecessary. If this song didn\u2019t have nice riffs I\u2019d probably skip this song much more often.\nAll right, after listening to what we have so far, an attempt at atmosphere would end up being laughable after those Return to the Eve episodes. Well Dense Macabre has a fitting title and damn well lives up to it. With just a mixture of chimes and random effects you get a feeling of pure doom, especially 2 minutes into it when they begin adding morbid (whoops) chants and more wind effects. It begins to linger and slightly fades into calm desolate atmosphere\u2026 Holy Damn what do we have here. What a song Nocturnal Fear is. It has that slaying opening riff, the speedy kickassness, not to mention the killer solo. In Celtic Frost fashion it slows itself down a bit for some more violent midsection riffage. Everything freezes at 2:00 with just a quiet bass line and then they hit you AGAIN with that opening riff and speediness. Then they go in between midtempo and speediness until it\u2019s all over.\n\nBut wait, it isn\u2019t quite done yet. We still have Emperor\u2019s Return.\nAnd thank god we do because here it is, the most punishing Celtic Frost/ Hellhammer song around, Circle of Tyrants. Oh god what a fucking riff we have here. That trademark \u201cUUGHH\u201d kicks this thrasher off the ground and into your bleeding ears. It doesn\u2019t stop there, after this thrashing has exhausted you out for the time being there comes this BRUTAL slow section. Nice drumming and more riffs. The thrash comes back for a good solo and then at 2:55 the most tortured scream I\u2019ve heard. Visual Aggression starts out with a surprisingly more upbeat sound, sort of like Motorhead mixed with Venom but it turns into a thrasher real quick. Nothing to fantastic riff-wise or technical-wise but it has a lot of energy and a cool little break with nice drums. Then there is another gem and a perfect way to end this album, Suicidal Winds. It\u2019s got a nice pace and a crushing riff and speeds up double time for some more headbanging material.\n\nYou pretty much have to get Emperor\u2019s Return (if not just for Circle of Tyrants) for the whole sense of \u201cclassic\u201d to sink in. If you think you\u2019ve heard it all from your Hellhammer albums you\u2019re very mistaken for this is the much better logical step up from Apocalyptic Raids. They have the formula down on this record and this is the peak of the member\u2019s career. Unfortunately this formula would be exhausted to the point of plain shit after a couple albums and the experimental stuff doesn\u2019t work out either. But why dwell on what will come; this is still \u201984 when you listen to this album. So get your hands on this if you can.\n",
        "\n\u201c...innocence and wrath now lie far beyond\u2026\u201d\n\nWith To Mega Therion well into the land of the living, the three-track Tragic Serenades was released to quell the fan club hordes yet again, but this time it will be absent of new tracks. Instead, loyalists are presented with the partially remixed and re-recorded \u201cJewel Throne\u201d and \u201cThe Usurper\u201d, straight from the sophomore release as well as a \u2018party\u2019 mix of the debut\u2019s \u201cReturn to the Eve\u201d. \n\nIs it me or do the terms \u201cCeltic Frost\u201d and \u201cparty\u201d in the same sentence seem a little disparaging? \n\nWell, I enjoyed To Mega Therion like an old geezer and his Lay-Z-Boy recliner, so was I going to complain? You put your ear to the woofer to locate the shadows of change. The first clear modification is a more boisterous production. Whether it\u2019s a better production is up for grabs (and from reading many opinions on this site of what a strong production is, it\u2019s just better that you hear it for yourself), but with a more in-yer-face approach it can rattle your grandfather\u2019s teeth right out of his head. Apparently, all bass lines had been re-recorded by Martin Ain, who took a vacation from To Mega Therion, and if you can find anything else different about these tracks, let me know. \n\nThe alterations are much easier to detect in \u201cReturn to the Eve\u201d. Distortion and echo are tangible like another limb, Tom\u2019s \u2018heeeeyyyys\u2019, \u2018oooohhs,\u2019 and sabotage of inflection shine like beacons to the north, and the female narration of Claudia Maria Mokri (originally by Hertha Ohling) is no longer hauntingly monotone or creepy and is now warped with echo and swan dives to the front of the mix \u2013 give me the original any day. Reed St. Mark adds more double bass and offers some additional vocals, mostly heard in the background a.k.a. oohs, aahs, laughter (remember, it\u2019s a party mix) and such things very un-Frost-ish, but works regardless. \n\nOn the back cover, widow-peaked Martin moves more to the gothic fashion, Reed is still the girl-catcher of the group (confirmed in Tom\u2019s book) and Mr. Warrior is as metal as ever. Little did we know these were all visual messages to the future of this outfit. Just look. \n\n\u201cwafts of might, wine and fire we were called to taste\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\n\u201cWhat will the wind bring these days?\u201d\n\nThe wind? Gale force wind of a Pacific typhoon would explode with a double hernia trying to lift the cavernous, molten din of Morbid Tales, and may very well be suicidal. \n\nDuring the hiatus between the debut ep/lp and To Mega Therion, it was decided a five-song ep would stave the hunger of Frost hordlings and perhaps give their new drummer a little more time to get acquainted with an over-the-top metal clamor that was about as well-traveled as the northern most tip of Greenland. Session drummer Stephen Priestly would decline an invitation to pound skins for the band on a eternal basis, but it is said all it took was a thirty second display of Reed St. Mark\u2019s prowess for him to get the job. \n\nSo it had two tracks from Morbid Tales on it (we Americans were spoiled as we already had these songs on our Metal Blade-released version) \u2013 didn\u2019t matter, it had three new songs, and for fans who slept with Morbid Tales under their pillows, they were worth their weight in blue twisted steel. Besides, there was always hope of an unannounced difference in the original versions.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cDethroned Emperor\u201d and \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d weren\u2019t revamped, but for the tenderfoot Frost listener they are a sheer example of the trio\u2019s lust for titanic slog, bludgeoning force, and fatalistic lyrics puked forth by one of the first vocal dins resembling death metal. The diabolical Phil \u201cwhatever happened to him?\u201d Lawvere cover artwork wasn\u2019t something you were going to flip by in a yawn, either. \n\nTo Mega Therion would be a few months away from release, so \u201cCircle of the Tyrants\u201d wasn\u2019t yet the Frost national hymn it would later become, and with most notably the famous establishing riff played faster, the hellish background bellowing textured a bit differently, and a tad more echo slanting Tom\u2019s lungs, the versions are only a few nuances apart. \u201cVisual Aggression\u201d would be the trio\u2019s most rabid speed track as well as Mark\u2019s public trial by fire and the band\u2019s speed quotient for the millennium. Perhaps one of Frost\u2019s most forgotten tracks prior to Into the Pandemonium is \u201cSuicidal Winds\u201d, plugged with a slew of tactical, moderately-paced rhythms, a great discordant Tom Warrior noise solo (patent pending), and even supplies more of the anti-drone that \u201cVisual Aggression\u201d sonically paraded with. \n\nOkay, the production isn\u2019t as meaty and thick as on the debut, but it\u2019s obvious when To Mega Therion hit the racks (and God-fearing people gasped), this is the sound route the band had intended. For the avant-garde and majestic atmosphere Frost had prepared for their sophomore effort, it probably needed it.\n",
        "\n\"...could I ever return, it would be my doom...\n\nHellhammer broke up?! I can still remember my buddy telling me at the lunch table he read it in Kick Ass Monthly (RIP). Though I didn't lose my appetite, I wasn't the least bit happy about it (or to be going to dreaded Spanish class next). About a month later there are reports Hellhammer has regrouped under the obscure moniker Celtic Frost minus drummer Bruce \"Denial Fiend\" Day. The world isn't in shambles after all. \n\nAlso inflating my mood was that an indie record store opened up in town that actually carried underground metal. Life doesn't get any better, eh? I get a ride over there, at this point looking for anything that wasn't mainstream, let alone anything from Celtic Frost. Guess what I found. \n\nThe bottom line is that Hellhammer's ashes were barely cold when Frost set naysayers and their cynicism on their ear with this one. As Hellhammer, they were called sloppy, sightless, and plain bad - the sewer of metal. Now sporting real names, a hardier production, honed songwriting, and the same superior lyricism, it turned out Morbid Tales would become one of the most influential early underground metal lps...and hardly anyone saw it coming.\n\nWhile bands like Slayer, Metallica, and Anthrax were playing faster than average, Frost's tempo went against that grain and while they didn't fear the speed realm, much of their material remained lethargic to mid-pace, one of the many elements that set the trio apart from their peers. In addition, few vocalists could remotely challenge Tom Warrior's deep sepulchral delivery, a short enviable list that would include legends Cronos, Tom Araya, Angel Ripper, and evil Chuck if you want to throw his demos into the fray. Lyrically, Tom and Martin's darkly lit prose are cryptic candles illuminating a chamber shadowed with the banality and overuse of other bands' topics and have yet to be paralleled (and my old lady couldn't get on my case 'cos there was no way she was deciphering their meaning). Then there was the presentation of it all. \n\nSure, after hearing a hundred or so uneventful and overlong intros of everything from groaning organs to people throwing up to movie snippets, the overlapped vocal melange may have your head lolling back, but in '84 when there were maybe 10 actual intros roaming about, \"Human\" (unnamed on the North American lp version) was quite disturbing. \"Into Crypts of Rays\" erupts with more speed than any of the four tracks on Apocalyptic Raids, a straight shot of aggression to rip Hellhammer cynics apart, yet Tom doesn't lose the finesse of his patented noise solos. To dispel illusions Frost has transformed the murky HH resonance into aural adrenaline, \"Visions of Mortality\" hauls in the pace to showcase true Frost grit; pillars of guttural guitars downtuned to the cellar floor for the ominous plod to come. With quicker momentum the track races to a close, but is tackled by the groaning sneer of top track \"Dethroned Emperor\". DE is a beast that travels with a mid-pace churn, then stalks with a frighteningly menacing plod that creeps over into the chorus where Tom actually bellows the title about three different ways. The title cut welds unconventional riffs and even-keeled tempos to speedy, double bass driven ones, ending side one with the serenity of a gorilla attack. \n\nSide two unceremoniously collides with \"Procreation (of the Wicked)\", the red-eyed brute that revels in a riff so discordant and heavy it almost rivals Sabbath's \"Electric Funeral\". The gait never increases above a quick lumber, and Tom's low, crying solo matches its mood. \"Return to the Eve\" is the birth of the band's future-famed experimentalism. Borrowing an uncharacteristic feature in Venom's track \"Welcome to Hell\", the female-narrated and hauntingly monotone verse 'Take my soul away into the dark...' is a purveyor to what Frost will accomplish, but it is a pebble to the avalanche that is \"Danse Macabre\", a lurid soundscape comprised of tinkling chimes, disparate moaning, chill wind, and lingering gloom that is more nightmare than song. With the subtleness of a choleric boar , \"Nocturnal Fear\" closes the eight-tracker with raucous rhythms, a quick primal chorus, the fastest rate yet, and a sinister 7-second interlude that comes out of nowhere and could've easily been in the previous track. \n\nMorbid Tales was just the beginning of the eclectic and obscure nuances, the avant-garde tidbits that would warp their way into songs with seemingly little provocation. \"Danse Macabre\" drifts from a blackness only Tom and Martin had seen through. Did anyone see it coming? Was anyone ready for it? Where did that tiny burst of bass-pumping horror come from in \"Nocturnal Fear\"? I notice many seem to either downplay or just plain forget this shade of Frost's fabric, the avant-garde tinges that would infiltrate their up-coming lps to a much more prevalent degree. At least they gave us a few albums to listen to before sinking into Cold Lake.\n\n...I've killed this old man, because he limped...\"\n",
        "\nWords can\u2019t describe the importance of this album for metal. Any black metal band in existence should lick the boots of everyone that was involved with this CD, bow down to their knees whenever they see one of these guys and say \u201cHail Celtic Frost\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s really that amazing. The version I have is the reissued one, Morbid Tales/Emperor\u2019s Return from 1988. But the truth is, these songs were writeen circa 1984/1985, two years or so before the thrash explosion of 1986. This came before Darkness Descends, Reign in Blood and countless others. Damn, but even for today, it sounds still fresh and ready to kick everyone\u2019s sorry asses.\n\nThe guitarwork is so damn top-notch. The eeeevil, noisy tone really adds up to the already great riffs not that complex like Sadus or anything, but there\u2019s nothing marginal here. It\u2019s very variated, with fast riffs coexisting with some midpaced ones and even some slowish, sludgy riffs. \u201cVisions of Mortality\u201d shows their hability. The drumming is simple but precise, to the point of making me not to wish some high-end drummer of today, like Proscriptor etc etc. I want it simple, raw and heartfelt.\n\nTalk about being heartfelt. This is the best adjective you can give to Tom G. Warrior. His vocals are full of will, he\u2019s not the kind of musician that does his stuff looking at his watch, waiting for the session to end. He likes to talk within the songs: \u201cThraaash!\u201d, he has the trademark \u201cuuuh, urrrrghh! aaagh!\u201d that we all know and love. And how can we forget:\n\n\u201cAre you morbid?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also very cohesive. The faster parts and the slower ones are perfectly alternated. We start with the blazing-fast \u201cInto the Crypts of Rays\u201d, then we go into the slower one, and the we go fast again, and fast\u2026 to stop into the massive, amazing midpaced sludge of \u201cProcreation of the Wicked\u201d. This riff is among the best of the CD, and the overall atmosphere is just priceless. Sepultura made a cover of this song, even sludgier and very well executed, but I can\u2019t exchange the original for nothing. Talking about covers, Opeth made a great job with the timeless classic \u201cCircle of the Tyrants\u201d. I don\u2019t care if this is a textbook thrash song but it rules so fucking much, namely the slower riff, backed up by the thunderous drumming. \n\n\u201cDanse Macabre\u201d is a fucking nightmare recorded on a fucking CD. This is one of the few songs in metal that can REALLY create a doomy atmosphere, not those boring funeral doom bands. It\u2019s a collage of creepy effects that WILL scare the shit out of you.\n\nFrom that track on, it\u2019s just lots of great riffs, from the pumping, ultra-fast, alarm-like one from \u201cNocturnal Fear\u201d, the overcatchy \u201cSuicidal Winds\u201d and the Kreator-like thrash attack of \u201cVisual Aggression\u201d. Damn, everything is a classic.\n\nGet it. Plain and simple. Obvioulsy, every metalhead I know has this, and it should be institutionalized that this should be among the first 5 CDs a rookie metalhead should get. Absolutely mandatory.\n",
        "\nAhh, yesss, Celtic Frost! One of my very favorite bands from \"back in the day\", and this album reigns supreme like few others do. With its unique and disturbing vibe, this is Tom G. and friends at their heaviest and most uncompromisingly \"kvlt\". Before that term even came into play, even.\n\nFirst of all, this is THE most evil, ugly, saturated wall of guitar noise EVAR. Few have even come close to even *trying* to clone it, the only person I kow of successfully doing so 100% being Trevor Peres (Obituary), and Sammy Duet of Goatwhore comes mighty close, too. It is what I model my personal guitar sound after when I play guitar, second only to \"RIB\"-era Slayer. It is Death personified, and the riffage that Tom spews out from start to finish is simply godhead, from the first charging riff of \"Into The Crypts of Rays\" to the last proto-speed metal riff in the title track. \n\nHis vocals are at their most guttural and distorted on this album, too--this is long before he got it into his head he could sing (he can't; sorry, Tom, but you just can't hang). Creepy occult lyrics left and right only add to the mysterious and sinister aura surrounding this album--it's like a template for Bathory, but with far better English and a slightly more artsy slant to the proceedings to set it apart from the average bands of that era. \n\nBassist Martin Ain (who actually wrote much of the lyrics due to his superior command of the language, if memory serves correctly) has a thick, bottomy tone that underpins that guitar onslaught perfectly, and Stephen Priestly is a master drummer, playing the right parts at the right times with impeccable timing and precision. The drums are a bit muffled for my taste, however, in the mix, but what else do you expect for 1984? \n\nThis album features some of the most overcovered tunes in metal history; \"Into The Crypts of Rays\", \"Procreation Of The Wicked\" (gotta love Tom's accent and how he makes that last word sound like \"Pro-creation uv de WICK-ETT!\"), and of course \"Dethroned Emperor\". It's not Tom's fault that those songs feature some of his most amazing riffing, whether it be \"Crypts\" and its merciless speedroar, \"Procreation\" with its groaning Sabbathy verse parts, or \"Dethroned Emperor\" and its fairly obvious ripoff of Diamond Head's \"Am I Evil?\". The rest of the album holds up and how as well, with the likes of \"Morbid Tales\" (proto-speed metal, as previously mentioned) and \"Visions of Mortality\", which builds from a doomy beginning to a thrash extravaganza that devastates all in its path.\n\nIf you don't own this classic album in some form, you just are not metal. There, I said it.\n",
        "\nThe last Celtic Frost album was this: Parched With Thirst Am I And Dying. An hour and 13 minutes of a large collection of rarities. Some of these songs were on EP's and vinyls that were long out of print and most of them are available on the re-released Celtic Frost albums. Even if you have the re-released albums, this is still a great buy.\n\nThe album starts out with Idols Of Chagrin which was supposed to a song on the never released Under Apollyon's Sun album. Seems that Tom Warrior backed out on his word of returning to an Into The Pandemonium type status. This would've fitted well on Vanity/Nemesis. The vocals aren't the old school death grunts, but they are heavier than the ones on Vanity/Nemesis. This is a pretty much a groove/heavy metal song. There is a nice part around 2:30 in where the guitar plays then stops then does it again until a small bass riff comes in and finally the guitar explodes with a short but cool solo. \n\nA Descent To Babylon (Babylon Asleep) is a track from the Vanity/Nemesis sessions. Its available now on the re-released Vanity/Nemesis. And just like all the tracks from Vanity/Nemesis it has those odd clean vocals that will turn off many people. Overall it's a pretty nice thrashy song. The solo 2 minutes sounds like it belongs in Morbid Tales or To Mega Therion... Damn you Celtic Frost... why'd you guys have to change?\n\nReturn To The Eve (studio jam) was from the Tragic Serenades EP and is now available on the re-released To Mega Therion album. The studio jam is so much superior to the original version off Morbid Tales. The vocals are fantastic with some laughs and whoo's heard every now and then. The guitars are much and now have natural harmonics. Even a metal n00b will see a huge difference in the drumming from Reed St. Mark. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Steve Priestly was great for whom he was but Reed is just a better drummer.\n\nJuices Like Wine was a track originally off Cold Lake. The song has been re-recorded and is much better than the original. When hearing this, you will seriously doubt that the original version was glam. This is full on thrash with the Vanity/Nemesis vocals.\n\nThe Inevitable Factor was from the Into The Pandemonium sessions now available from the re-released ITP album. The song is totally kickass with a gloomy atmosphere featuring a magnificent performance by every band member. Tom Warrior unleashes his tragic vox (gothic moans) and delivers a fine guitar performance with a cool solo. Tom also adds keyboards from the verses. It's just 2 notes but they contribute so much to the gloomy atmosphere. The song would've been bland without it. Martin Ain's bass is cool as well. And who could forget Reed's awesome drum performance? During the first verse the drumming is a bit conservative but on every verse line, Reed delivers a barrage of drums.\n\nThe Heart Beneath is from Vanity/Nemesis. Most likely put on this album due to the low sales of Vanity/Nemesis. After all, Celtic Frost lost tons of fans from Cold Lake so many fans decided not to buy Vanity/Nemesis thinking that Celtic Frost can't make quality albums anymore. The Heart Beneath is the opener on Vanity/Nemesis and a solid track.\n\nCherry Orchards is the radio shortened version of the original Cold Lake track.\n\nTristesses De La Lune was from Into The Pandemonium. At first I hated this track but now I see the real beauty of it. It's a sad, dark, gothic song with only strings and French female vocals. \n\nWings Of Solitude is again from Vanity/Nemesis. Solid track with acoustic guitars and lead female vocals. Tom Warrior only sings during the chorus.\n\nThe Usurper is the re-recorded version originally only available on the Tragic Serenades EP but now available on the re-release of To Mega Therion. I actually enjoyed the original version more than this but this is still a great song. Tom Warrior struggles a bit with the vocals but he was having problems back in '86. I was always thinking that he had problems with his voice back then which explained the lamer death grunts on Into The Pandemonium. I recently found a German interview with Martin Ain where Martin said that Tom was having problems with his voice and strained it a few times.\n\nJourney Into Fear was from the Emperor's Return sessions. A fiery, fast-paced death/thrash track with lyrics still unknown after all these years. The scream 3:05 in and the great solo are all memorable. This song will leave you screaming JOURNEY INTO FEAR!!!\n\nDowntown Hanoi, like Juices Like Wine, is from Cold Lake but has been re-recorded in '91. Just like the re-recorded Juices Like Wine it\u2019s a solid thrash track although bits of glam can be felt from the slightly cheery atmosphere. The 2 solo's are both experimental pretty much being amp feedback and long sustains.\n\nCircle Of The Tyrants... this track is from the To Mega Therion version. Slightly re-mastered are the only changes done to this classic. It was most likely added because it's their trademark song.\n\nIn The Chapel In The Moonlight is a Dean Martin cover originally only available on a rare LP that was limited to 1000 copies. Now it's available on the re-released Into The Pandemonium album. It\u2019s a short, mid-paced thrash song with Martin Ain on backing vocals during the chorus.\n\nI Wont Dance (The Elder's Orient) is the shortened radio version from the original Into The Pandemonium classic.\n\nThe Name Of My Bride is from the Vanity/Nemesis album. A solid mid-paced thrash track that would've been perfect on Morbid Tales or To Mega Therion if Tom used death grunts.\n\nMexican Radio is a '91 studio jam. This is a decent version of this song but the original Into The Pandemonium cover was much better. It starts out with an intro solo and the bass is pretty audible throughout but the chorus is just lame. The part about the barbequed iguana is just awful and stupid. The atmosphere is just too happy.\n\nUnder Apollyon's Sun is from the never released Under Apollyon's Sun album. The song has a similar style to Idols Of Chagrin but it has a much darker atmosphere and much better in every way. Sure, Tom Warrior doesn't return to the Into The Pandemonium status but this is still a pretty damn good groove/thrash metal song. Just like Idols Of Chagrin, this track has a moment of brief silence then a brief guitar riff followed by an explosive guitar solo. For once there's a dual solo between Tom Warrior and Curt Victor Bryant but this moment is brief as the second guitar quickly returns to the rhythm riff. The song changes halfway through to an awesome riff with the cool vocal line of \"TO LIE! TO CRY! TO DIE!!!\" that I've been worshipping daily.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic album. If you love Celtic Frost, you'll love this. If you're a newcomer to this band, then this'll give you a taste of how much they changed over the years...\n",
        "\nCeltic Frost made quite the little EP with this record. While it lacks the speedy violence of the Hellhammer material, it's \"hell's furnace\" sound never worked better than it did on this record. I don't really \"like\" or \"dislike\" Celtic Frost, as I find MOST of it to be Hellhammer watered down like the beer at a terrible bar, or cocaine cut with mostly baby-ass-powder. This still manages though, in it's playing and violence...to capture a certain mood and darkness that made a large impact. The band here is thick, aggressive and on the ball! The musicianship and production are better than Hellhammer...but the mood is more relaxed and the songwriting a bit less extreme.\n\n\"Dethroned Emperor\" and all of the other tracks just clobber like a punch-drunk boxer with arms of steel. It grumbles and stumbles but does so gloriously, as if it were a machine slowly smashing steel plated together. Tom put together his best tracks post-Hellhammer here, and I can say nothing but good things about them. It's doomy, it's black...it's brutal! Tommy may not have matched the evil of Hellhammer, but he did create a mood of darkness and doom previously untouched.\n\nIf I have to tell people to buy ONE EP it's this one. It's meaty thickness and vile mood show a classier side to doom-black metal that was rarely show before, or after this release. I could honestly give a fuck about Tom G. Warriors work after this...and you'd be foolish to pass it by. It certainly works for what it is...possibly influencing more doom-black styled metal than any other band before them.\n\nYou know...that's some neato artwork there too. \n\nBUY OR DIE!!!\n",
        "\nThis video may already get people to look the other since most of the songs are off the dreaded Cold Lake album which I actually like. But that's not the biggest problem. Unfortunately being the only official Celtic Frost live release it has lousy sound quality. Tom Warrior's guitar is completely muffled out. He solo's around 4 or 5 times during the show yet you can barely hear it. If you turn the volume up very loud you may hear it slightly. \n\nStephen Priestly's drums are the only thing that sound good. Curt Victor Bryant's bass can be heard most of the time. Oliver Amberg's guitar can be heard nicely. And as I stated earlier Tom Warrior's guitar is completely muffled. Dont be thinking something stupid like Tom isnt playing his guitar because he is. Even during the encore when they play Circle Of The Tyrants, Tom and Curt switch instruments and Curt is playing the guitar you cant hear it. All you can hear is Oliver's annoying guitar. Everything sounds slightly muffled even the vocals but inbetween songs when Tom is announcing the songs those parts sound great. \n\nOliver Amberg himself is very annoying. He has by far the oddest long hair I've ever seen. Its sort of like a mullet but puffy in a hair metal/glam rock way which was the bands position then. His stage presence is completely stupid. He runs and jumps around constantly. Curt sometimes gets up near Stephen probably just to get away from Oliver. Oliver is pretty damn good lead guitarist. His solo's are pretty amazing but the way his guitar sounds gets annoying after a while. There is a moment when Tom and Curt leave the stage and Oliver is left soloing for a few minutes. I bet Tom and Curt got annoyed of him and decided to take a little break. Oliver also likes to get a little close to the other band members. \n\nOverall I like this video even with the shitty sound. I like the Cold Lake album unlike many others and if this video had better sound I'd love it...\n",
        "\nCELTIC FROST was a band WAY ahead of its time. Even the music Tom Warrior and Martin Ain released as HELLHAMMER, the precursor to CELTIC FROST, was a heavy and brutal style that had a major influence on the death, thrash and black metal to come. In 1984 CELTIC FROST released \u201cMorbid Tales,\u201d considered by most to be a true metal classic. The band were early pioneers of thrash and death and began to build a following, although they never received the fame they deserved. In 1987 the band released \u201cInto the Pandemonium,\u201d considered, depending on who you ask, as the pinnacle of their creative genius, or a giant step backward that served as the first step in the creative demise of the band. Since you\u2019re asking me\u2014hey, it\u2019s my review\u2014I\u2019ll say it definitively: not only is this CF\u2019s best album, it is one of the best metal albums of all time. There, I said it. \n\nNow, I realize that some of you are reading this and yelling at the screen \u201cHas this guy lost what little mind he had?\u201d and others are thinking that they should go out and pick this up post haste\u2014one of the best metal albums of all time, and such. A word of caution/disclaimer: this album is not for everyone. There are several songs that are consistent with CELTIC FROST\u2019s earlier work. \u201cInner Sanctum\u201d and \u201cBabylon Fell\u201d are the best examples of classic CF. However, there are several songs that demonstrate significant experimentation and development of their classic sound, and a few songs that are just plain totally different from anything they have ever done. \n\nRex Irae (Requiem) is a masterpiece that serves as a perfect example of many of these innovations. The song has booming, doom percussion, female co-lead vocals, and strings. Warrior\u2019s vocals include a combination of his usual gruff bark and a technique he uses on several tracks, a clean tortured moaning vocal. The result is magnificent. I\u2019m not sure there is even a category for this sound, the band blends sounds from several categories, many of which weren\u2019t even categories yet. Remember, this is 1987, you just didn\u2019t hear bands using operatic vocals and symphonic arrangements, much less some of the other tricks these guys had up their sleeves. Sampling--in metal--in 1987. Not that nu-metal stuff, but the track about the moon landing \u201cOne in Their Pride\u201d contains vocal samples and either a drum machine, or a drum machine impression. Contrast that with another example, the haunting \u201cTristesses de la Lune\u201d a song that contains strings and female vocals performed entirely in French. The companion track \u201cSorrows of the Moon\u201d is in English. Also exceptional are the R&B style backup vocals on the otherwise very heavy \u201cI Won\u2019t Dance (The Elders Orient)\u201d and the bizarre cover of the new wave WALL OF VODOO song \u201cMexican Radio.\u201d Including the song is strange enough, the fact that it opens the album is just plain odd. \n\nCritics claim that \u201cInto the Pandemonium\u201d tried to mix too many genres and add too many new sounds and influences, and as a result the album is just a disjointed hodge podge. No doubt, it took major cajones to release this album, especially when the band was gaining momentum with their earlier stuff. However, the talent, innovation and variation on this album make it worthy of a place in every metal head\u2019s collection and for many, a place as one of the most revered albums in that collection. Pure and simple\u2014\u201cMorbid Tales\u201d got me into CELTIC FROST, \u201cInto the Pandemonium\u201d hooked me for good.\n",
        "\nIt's very difficult to choose the best CF album, but if I had to choose one I would probably chose this one.\nIt's not their heaviest nor the fastest album, but by far the most innovative and avantgarde thing they have ever recorded. 'Into The Pandemonium' was released a decade before its time. It's easy to comprehend why many people has never understood it.\nIt still has some of the violence and the heaviness of 'To Megatherion', in fact songs like \"Inner Sanctum\" would have fit perfectly in that album, but there are a lot of innovations as well. Tom Warrior mixes his traditional screams with some melancholic vocals very much in the vein of bands like The Cure, there are lots of orchestral arrangements with violins, choruses, viola, cello and the same French horn they had already used on 'To Megatherion' (remember songs like \"The Usurper\" or \"Necromantical Screams\"?)... and perhaps the most atonishing improvement: the use of programmed drums in the remix of the instrumental song \"One In Their Pride\".\nLyirically there are some big impreovements as well, as this album is much more romantic (not in the sense of love, but in the sense of romanticism). \"Mesmerized\" is pure poetry and the same happens with \"Sorrows Of The Moon\". \"Rex Irae\", with its dialogues, is a perfect example of the influence of the so called Opera Rock in the album. Almost all lyrics deal in some way with old oriental traditions (Babylon, Carthage...) and music helps to bring to the listener this oriental feeling.\nI can't imagine modern Metal without this album. Where could be bands like My Dying Bride or Therion without 'Into The Pandemonium'?\n",
        "\nListening to this album is really hard on me. It reminds me of the time, recalling the awesomeness that was CARNIVORE, that I heard Type O Negative. I couldn't get an erection for weeks until I consulted some Death Strike.\n\nThere are a few songs that don't completely suck. They are \"Inner Sanctum\", and moments of \"Sorrows Of The Moon\" and \"Babylon Fell\"(in between all that fucking gothic remorse shit). \n\nGothic, that's the way I would describe Warrior's vocal change. Instead of kicking ass like he did before, he changed his vocal patterns and sounds more along the lines of bands like Christian Death, Sisters Of Mercy, etc. He intermixes these gothic vocals with his old school vocals which made albums like To Mega Therion and Morbid Tales, and the material by Hellhammer classic. Unfortunately, those sort of gothic vocals don't compliment this album very well. They sound good in the sort of music that bands like Bauhaus play, but not in the kind of stuff Celtic Frost do. \n\nThe worst song (and best for comedic value) is \"One In Their Pride\". This song has a fucking break beat in it: everytime I listen to this song I keep expecting to fucking see LL Cool J start rapping while some dudes are breakdancing in the background. Not exactly what I was looking for.\n\nSo to sum it up: Fuck this shit. I'll take songs like \"The Usurper\" and \"Into The Crypts Of Rays\" anyday over this garbage.\n",
        "\nAfter the classics \"Morbid Tales\" and \"To Mega Therion\" (both of which feature the ugliest, most frightening guitar tone known to man, a beautiful sound!), and the flawed-yet-still good \"Into The Pandemonium\" (I refuse to acknowledge \"Cold Lake\" and fondly remember the night they played my hometown on that tour--the fans threw lipstick at them!), Celtic Frost were at a crossroads. And they went the right way with this cruncher of a comeback effort. \n\nRoli Mosimann's production is absolutely perfect, with crunchy guitars, clanging, rumbling bass you can hear and feel, and cracking drums that really nail it down. Tom and Co. knew it was make or break on this one and you can feel it with the urgency of the new material. The following are some of the better tunes on this album.\n\n\"The Heart Beneath\" starts with a whisper, then builds to a uptempo metal number which, while not as thrashy or extreme as their earlier material, still kicks up a pretty respectable fuss. \"Wine In My Hand (Third From The Sun\" follows with a slightly faster verse bursting into a thrashing chorus and some nicely jagged and jarring riffing post chorus.\"Wings of Solitude\" changes gears into a more subdued and quiet verse with acoustic guitars and whispered female (?) vocals that erupts into a heavy chorus featuring more of the female backing vocals and Tom roaring better than he had done in a while at the time. The only real problem on this album for me is that Tom still thought he could sing instead of roar (he can't sing at all, and his weak clean vocals are the only real annoyance here), and this holds back the album some. But he does get in his classic death grunts here and there, and that makes up for it a little. \n\n\"The Name Of My Bride\" sees them heading back to heavier, doomier territory, with plaintive vocals--Tom's clean vocals actually work on this number, dare I say it, with their anguish benefitting the tune well. \"Restless Seas\" is more uptempo, more hard rock in feel, with a catchy as hell chorus that features more wailing female vocals, and even a nice little bass solo with very cool syncopations and groove from Martin Ain--his bass tone KILLS on this album! The heavy version of David Bowie's \"Heroes\" is OK at best, I see it as a curiosity more than anything else. Especially since they cut out half the song in the process of converting it to a more metallized approach.\n\nEven more of a hard rock approach was, for me anyway, a better direction for Celtic Frost to head into for this album. At least the riffs and soloing were more urgent, and far heavier than its wretched predecessor. Tom gets his mojo back for the vocals on this album (excepting most of his clean vox), and even Stephen Priestly (original Morbid Tales session drummer) had joined the band full time by this album. It's not up to the level of the first two albums, of course--what could be?--but it still is a respectable effort nonetheless. I still enjoy this album to this day.\n",
        "\nThis album just rules. It's simple, heavy, raw, primitive, dark, gloomy, but at the same time, beautiful, unique, emotional, powerful and atmospheric, thanks to experimentations with classical instruments and opera singers. These adjectives aren't seen together very often, and that right there shows how special this album is. \"Into The Pandemonium\" is the quintessential Celtic Frost album in the way that all the songs are very strong overall, but also because this is where all of the band's experimenting came together.\nThe band shows off their \"classical-meets-metal\" side with \"Tristesses de la Lune\", \"Rex Irae (Requiem)\"(both include a female singer, with the former being sung completely in french) and Oriental Masquerade. The band still keeps their primitive, heavy as hell metal songs that are comparible to getting a sledgehammer to the head in this album, but some of them have been added a little something to make it more than just simple musical sledgehammer to the head. \"Caress Into Oblivion\" has a chanting monk at the beginning and tribal instruments in the background for some of the songs. \"Mesmerized\" and especially \"Sorrows Of The Moon\" play with atmosphere to nice effect, while \"I Won't Dance(The Elder's Orient)\" includes R&B background singers to the mix. This album also includes a very heavy version of new wavers Wall Of Voodoo's \"Mexican Radio\"! But not to worry people, the no-frills,simple but sweet headbangers are here as well and very well-represented by \"Inner Sanctum\" and \"Babylon Fell\". Hell, the band even experimented with electronic influences and sampling, with \"One In Their Pride (Porthole Mix)\" and \"One In Their Pride (Extended Mix)\". \nIt's true, this album did help usher in black metal, but to me, this album is much, much more than that. Into The Pandemonium is an album full of weird, gutsy, but very sucessful experiments, and they do it without alienating their fans, which is what they would do, however, with their next album, Cold Lake, with it's more radio-friendly sound and pictures of the band all glammed up. This is a very unique and groundbreaking album that no one should miss.\n"
