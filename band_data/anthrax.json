        "\nSound of White Noise is, according to some, when Anthrax \"matured\". Replacing Joey Belladonna on vocals is the Layne Staley-like vocalist from Armored Saint, John Bush. There are many problems with this album, but John Bush isn't one of them. He's actually a great vocalist, but his tenure with the band marked a significant shift in not only style, but also quality. Sound of White Noise contains the last vestiges of what Anthrax used to be, as there are still thrash-like sections, but they are heavily neutered, becoming groovier and decidedly more rock-oriented. This album was the band's attempt at making their own Metallica black album, but it's also trying very hard to be Alice in Chains as well. Just listen to the funky riffs and look at that cover art, it all screams of Facelift to me. Anthrax tried to chase trends instead of doing what they're good at, that being intense, punky thrash.\n\nAll that being said, is it bad? No. Is it good? Also no. This album is, to me, simply mediocre on a whole. The band is so focused on making accessible music here by ironing out any sort of extremity that what we're left with is a bit of a mishmash of both bad and good, which boils down to a painfully average listening experience. It's such a simplified version of their thrash sound which often sounds like a very early template for nu metal. What really sucks about all this is that Anthrax is capable of so much more than what they do here. Persistence of Time saw them experiment with slower thrash, and that's one of their best albums. Instead of sticking to that winning hand, they folded all their cards for groovy pop metal! What a shame!\n\nI like some tracks on here, such as Room for One More, Potter's Field, Invisible, and Burst, but even this album's best stuff could have been so much better, had they just stuck to their guns instead of trying to be something they're not. Why go groovegrunge of all things? Money and record executive meddling? Probably. Every big four band tried something like this in the early 90s, but Anthrax only got it right once before descending into pure shit. At least the early '90s Metallica and Megadeth albums are enjoyable, but Sound of White Noise biggest sin is that it's quite forgettable because the band plays it so damn safe. So many sections of this album seem to be building towards a pummeling Among The Living apex, but it ultimately fizzles out time after time, with the band indulging in almost Incubus-like, by the numbers groove rock. I'm not mad at this album, I'm just thoroughly disappointed and unconvinced by it.\n",
        "\nGuitarist Scott Ian got fed up with vocalist Joey Belladonna during the recordings of previous album 'Persistence of Time' (1990); Scott didn't find Joey's style suitable for his angry lyrics. No matter how good the band was doing (pretty damn good, actually!), in 1992 Joey got kicked out. Scott wanted to move Anthrax forward.\n\nEverybody gets older and wants to try out something new. Understandable. Maybe to conquer new land and find new fans, maybe for money, but some just do not want to stagnate, simple as that. And the stagnation was a big enemy for Anthrax. Their style hadn't changed much at all since 1987's classic thrash metal album 'Among the Living'; even though they surely got way heavier and very much serious with 'Persistence of Time'. However, what was to come three years later, I don't believe anybody could have guessed how it went.\n\nNew winds were blowing in the world of heavy music at the time, and the biggest \"thanks\" goes to grunge. That said, I'd like to point out that Anthrax did not go grunge, but they certainly changed. The band's musical horizon was expanded with more rocking and catchier songwriting and the sound got less metal, but they still kept their other feet in thrash metal, at least their toes. But: Anthrax sounded new Anthrax, and many didn't like the changes that took place; not back in the day, not even today. Just like many a metal band prior to them, Anthrax downsized their sound and compositions. Think about Metallica after '...And Justice for All' (1988), Iron Maiden after 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' (1988) and Queensr\u00ffche after 'Operation: Mindcrime' (1988). There was no way the bands wanted to go even bigger with their sound. 'Persistence...' was so huge, with both the compositions and the sound. It was surely a surprise, but I didn't get heart attack. That's because there had been transitions before, for Anthrax and for many, many other bands I listened to, and I never was a purity freak: \"They can't change! They are not doing it for their fans!\" They cannot grow up? They cannot try a new sound? They have to stagnate and be totally pale imitation of themselves?\n\nSo, Anthrax's sound got stripped down a bit even though there never was anything else, or more, but just the band, really. The songs also got shorter, but not into S.O.D. lengths; the shortest one's 3:42, and the most being on both sides of 5 minutes, plus still we got three songs that went over 6-minute mark. They still had thrash metal, but the band brought back heavy metal (1985's 'Spreading the Disease' was hefty on that department, too) and presented rock into their sound. Still, it is not Judas Priest or Iron Maiden type heavy metal, but more US-styled, like it was tilted towards the rock department, and especially the groove factor that got introduced with this album. It was an unique-sounding mixture, for sure, and very much a baffling one at that for them poor old fans.\n\nThe first single cut, 'Hy Pro Glo' is a groovier number, which surely baffled people. It contains good vocal lines, but the band's thrash tightness had turned into looser groove. It is still tight as heck in rocking way, though. The next single was 'Only' (released after the album), which is straight song, and great at that. However, it was too straight for many. While there are heavier and thrashier songs like the opener 'Potter Field', '1000 Point of Hate' and 'Burst', they all have looser vibe to them, especially through the vocals, which also bring in melodiousness. 'Persistence of Time' was such a dark album, the band didn't probably want to dive than far into the abyss this time around. 'Room for One More' is this album's 'Indians' in a way, being one of the closest links to the band's past stylings. The third single, 'Black Lodge' certainly murdered the shreds of expectations of those who hadn't picked up the album with its Twin Peaks vibe. Angelo Badalamenti provided his instrumental expertise into this dark and brooding piece, which contains absolutely great feely vocal lines.\n\nThe rhythm section is as unique and adventurous as before, and even further; they really have an inimitable style and they are everywhere, all the time, really. Charlie Benante came up with new beats and bassist Frank Bello is on the loose and wild here. I've always appreciated them very high, and more so than anything else about the band, to tell the truth. The guitars aren't about Scott Ian's sharp-as-fuck riffing anymore, as there's lots of punky and rocking strumming now. Dan Spitz still had some shots left when he created those memorable solos, mostly pretty shredding, but at times, bluesy.\n\nAngrier vocalist was found in Armored Saint frontman John Bush. His raspy and dry-ish, very much belligerent style of singing was indeed perfect for the new sound of Anthrax. His voice was more about rock than metal, and a tad punk-ish. When needed, he did some ample metal singing (e.g. '1000 Points of Hate'). And to fuck things up a bit more, he sounds like rougher Layne Staley (Alice In Chains) every now and then here! Still, that does not make this grunge. Mr. Bush had at least some kind of range in his voice, but it was nothing compared to Joey's. So, he had a range and the skills, but also rather unique voice. He did fit to the band's sound perfectly. A lot of songs carry the topic of rotten relationship, and other topic are criminal minds, religious hypocrisy and other human weaknesses.\n\nThe album was produced by Dave Jerden, formerly known with his work with Jane's Addiction, Alice In Chains, and... surprise, surprise; Armored Saint! However, Alice In Chains were absolutely huge, and I guess that fact put that grunge stamp on this album. The guitar sound is dry and buzzing, non-thrash smaller than previously. Actually, the guitars sound non-metal, except during heavier riffing. But again, it does not make this album grunge. They are somewhat muddy and are drowned into everything else. The guitar production is a sort of a failure, for sure. The drums sound powerful as always, as does the pulsating bass guitar.\n\nWhen I got this album, on its release day, I remember liking it partly. It felt like a small failure. However, it did not take very long for me to start appreciating it as a whole. This is a solid album, period. It's not the biggest side step ever in metal music or for the band: This is a very tight album when compared to the band's lowest point, 'Volume 8 - The Threat Is Real' from 1998, where the band had totally lost the red thread. This sounds different to anything else the band had put out earlier, but I also feel they needed to take a side step from 'Among the Living' / State of Euphoria' (1988) / 'Persistence of Time' triplet, since it could have become totally stagnated. Well, they went further with their simplifying later on...\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nI do not think Worship Music is a 'true' comeback album. Nor do I think it even is good album. It has only two, perhaps three good songs. To me it sounds like Anthrax made a compilation of obscure B-sides from different eras and then re-recorded them with one vocalist.\n\nI'm gonna give you a lot of backstory to explain how they got to this point. So bear with me, ok?\n\nWhen your strongest point in a band is also your weakest link? It actually happens. Dave Mustaine isn't the only example. In this case it is rhythm guitarist Scott Ian, original founding member of the band and sole survivor. Here's a guy who came from money and wanted to make it in the music business instead of getting a respectable job as was expected of him. Especially after seeing Kiss live in december 1977 he became obsessed. His fanatic efforts paid off when his band got a record deal late 1983 and even more so when Among The Living landed in 1987. He was also able to keep the band alive and succesful when grunge became huge by going for a full blown Anthrax-meets-Alice In Chains approach on the Sound Of White Noise album in 1993. Yeah, Scott has done a lot of work for Anthrax. \n\nHowever: two sides of the coin; Scott Ian has always come over as someone with a borderline personality. You're either in his good book or you're out of his life, quickly. Even his dealings with fans are a mixed bag. Most of us will know the stories how he treats some like shit. It's no secret. (I have never met him by the way) This erratic behaviour also goes for his taste and direction. When he gets enthusiastic about something fresh and new, the rest just have to fall in step with this new whim or they can fuck off. In 1978 he wanted to be as cool as Ace Freyhley, in 1983 he wanted to be as cool as James Hetfield, in 1993 he wanted to be as cool as Jerry Cantrell and in 1995 he desperately wanted to be as cool as Dimebag. Being inspired is a good thing but in Scott's case if often became a huge cringeworthy fanatical mancrush. \n\nNow this comes from a combination of deeply embedded insecurity and a keen eye for marketing. A dangerous combination which can either be energising to his surroudings or burn it all down. \n\nScott Ian has created a lot of collateral damage over the decades. \nOn a personal level; just ask Neil Turbin, Greg Walls, Joey Belladonna, Dan Spitz and Billy Milano. If he needs you, you're his best buddy. If not... well. He even fired his best friend Dan Lilker. Only to feel bad about it for the rest of his life. He's damn lucky S.O.D. turned out great.\nOn a business level; just listen to the pile of garbage that was Stomp442 back in 1995, the cashgrab that was the second era of S.O.D. (It wasn't for Milano & Lilker), the Dan Nelson failure (Trying to be Pantera 2.0 two decades too late), the cashgrab 2005 reunion. And the list goes on.\n\nHow lucky for him he met Charlie Benante mid-1983 who turned out to be a fabulous drummer but also a strong riff- and songwriter. Benante turned out to become Scott's saviour on a creative level. Because without Benante, I doubt Scott would've gotten as famous as he did.\n\nIn the 2004 the ship that was Scott had gone adrift. And his band with him. Although the last album the band made with John Bush was pretty decent, the band were still playing venues only a quarter of the size they were used to in the late eighties nor did they even get back the level of popularity during Sound of White Noise. They had wandered off too much for too long. Scott wanted to take back his fame and the band reunited with Belladonna and Spitz in 2005. Just like Kiss in 1996 a profitable decision but - just like Kiss - one which would explode soon enough. And so Belladonna and Spitz were once again out somewhere in 2007.\n\nTurmoil! The band did some gigs with John Bush and got back Rob Caggiano on lead guitar. They tried yet another singer (Dan Nelson), recorded an album, fired Nelson (a lawsuit followed), tried to get John back but he declined because he didn't want to sing on an album which was written with another vocalist. This time Scott (nor Benante) could not save the band. \n\nBut a miracle happened. And the miracle was pretty much Metallica. The band who first showed Anthrax the ways of thrash metal in 1982. They now again showed Anthrax the way by inviting them to do the Big-4 concerts together in 2010. The band got back Joey Belladonna since fans coming to the shows would probably prefer songs from the Belladonna days, the most famous era. Belladonna, always being the good friendly guy, accepted to join the band for the third time.\n\nAlso Belladonna agreed to sing on the new album. Some songs were reworked and others remained as they were. And even though it is fun to finally hear him sing again on an Anthrax studio album for the first time since Attack of the Killer B's, everyone with at least one working ear can easily hear most of these new songs hardly had anything to do with the first Belladonna era. 'Crawl', 'Revolution Screams', 'I'm Alive' being the most obvious ones. They could have been on B-sides of 'We've Come For You All' singles. Heck, 'I'm Alive' was still called 'Vampyres' when Dan Nelson was still in the band and live versions can still be found online. I actually quite like 'I'm Alive' but 'Crawl' and 'Revolution Screams' are tedious filler, no matter which vocalist sings them.\n\nOk, so even though Belladonna is back, this album doesn't sound anything like the first Belladonna era at all. Is that a bad thing? Well not per say if the material was outstanding. But most of it just isn't. The majority of the material is meandering old men metal. They pick up the pace on a few songs like 'Earth on Hell', 'The Giant', 'Fight 'Em 'til You Can't' and 'The Constant' but they have been writing so much groove metal for 17 years they just don't seem to be able to contruct a thrashing song which doesn't lose its vibe or energy. \n\nThey put in these godawful breakdowns every time, it is tedious. Are Scott & co trying to appeal to the Lamb of God generation? Seems that way. They even had 'bad boy' Dan Nelson in the band for a while with his gruff vocals and wrote the majority of this album with him so it is clear they were going in that direction before they made the u-turn and got back Belladonna. \n\nThe chorus of 'The Giant' totally wrecks the song, same goes for 'Earth on Hell'. 'The Constant' tries to combine the groove of the Bush era with the melodies of the Persistence era. It all sounds so contrived and unconvincing. The quality of songwriting matched the level of indecisiveness the band have been suffering from since 2004.\n\nYes, 'Fight 'Em 'til You Can't' is a song which at least sounds a bit like the succesful Belladonna era but the band needed to plagiarise themselves to achieve it by rehashing the 'Gridlock' riff (Persistence of Time, 1990). Can they simply not come up with a flashy thrash metal riff anymore? Or is it Benante who has lost his touch? Isn't Scott able to get back his S.O.D. state of mind and push aside Benante for perhaps one or two riffs? Scott said in about every interview back in 1992 for the S.O.D. album Live at Budokan that he had pretty much written the entire Speak English Or Die album. So, what's keeping him? Are you saying Scott hasn't written a single riff since the Bigger than the Devil album. A guitarist, a professional guitarist, who hasn't written even ONE worthwhile riff in 11 years? I find that rather difficult to believe.\n\nFor years we'd been hearing how Benante comes up with riffs and songs for Anthrax and Bello (bass,backing vocals) has a say in harmonies and melodies but where's Scott's input, apart from lyrics? If he pretends to be 'so metal' why didn't he attempt to create some fucking THRASH metal again.\n\nA song like 'The Devil You Know' is just plain pathetic. Some kind of of meandering mid nineties grungemetal with a terrible cheesy chorus. It sounds like the band rehashed 'King Size' from Stomp442 with Joey on vocals this time. It's like they haven't really grown in 15 years. I cannot understand people actually and honestly like this biker music. Even the official video to the song was boring as hell. Not to mention those silly stage outfits they wear these days. They look like aged repair shop guys from a deleted Martin Scorsese scene these days. Didn't anyone tell them Metallica did that on Garage Inc back in 1998 already? And they did a better job at it? I'm not saying these guys should wear jams again at the age of 60+ but I just think they look awfully bland. There is no visual aspect to them anymore.\n\nThe only song on the entire album which I would call 'good' apart from 'I'm Alive' would be 'In The End'. It is a song which does not sound like old eighties Anthrax nor does it have anything in common with the Bush era. A doomy, atmospheric song. Great hamornies (guitarwise and vocally). And guess what, it was the only song which was finished AFTER Belladonna had rejoined. Perhaps they should've taken some time and come up with a good album, a new reborn sound. A reinvention of themselves instead of this mixed bag. At least they were smart enough to change the working title \"Worship Metal\" to \"Worship Music\". Pfew!\n\nHad Belladonna not sung on it, I am sure it would not have been received as well as it did back then. It was the \"hooray Joey is back\" euphoric vibe at the time which saved it from obscurity and made fans wet themselves. Also I have to admit Joey's voice has aged way too much for my taste. He often sings so much lower than back in the late eighties. I just don't get 'into' it at all. I've seen them live a couple of times since but they always play the same songs anyway. This band, it pains me to admit it, has gotten boring. On record as well as live.\n\nThis is such a faceless and directionless album it just hurts. On a positive note, it's at least better than Stomp 442. But that one set the bar far beyond low.\n",
        "\nIt was over. Anthrax was dead.\n\nTheir 2005 reunion with Joey Belladonna lasted about five minutes, and when they asked John Bush\u2014whom they'd just replaced with Belladonna\u2014to forget all about it and come back, Bush essentially and understandably told them to go fuck themselves.\n\nAnd let's not even talk about how they tried to solve this dilemma by hiring a random dude literally named \"Dan Nelson.\"\n\nSomehow, after the promising release of We've Come for You All in 2003, Anthrax had once again killed their momentum and found themselves back in a hole. A big hole. In fact, a hole that seemed destined to swallow the band for good. No band on Earth could bounce back from this.\n\nThat is, unless Earth is on Hell.\n\nTo put it mildly, Worship Music was an unlikely album. Not just because of the drama that preceded its release, but even more so because of its quality. That this record even exists is one thing, but Worship Music has absolutely no right to be as good as it is. For a band teetering on the edge of dissolution to somehow write some of the best songs of their career is a testament to their talent, their perseverance and of course, the unpredictability that has defined Anthrax since its inception.\n\nNow, full disclosure\u2014Worship Music isn't quite a return to the band's thrash days. It's more like a reintroduction of that sound into a more diverse palette. There are parts of Worship Music that rage with an intensity Anthrax hadn't displayed in decades, but there's also\u2014as you might expect\u2014a lot of 90s-leftover groove. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that the album was written with a different vocalist in mind. Perhaps if the re-returning Joey Belladonna had been present from the start, the album would\u2019ve been more cohesively suited to his talents, but as it stands, the more Belladonna-appropriate uptempo tracks are the highlights of the album.\n\nSpeaking of highlights, the album's first half is packed with them. Opening track \"Earth on Hell\" is a massive thrasher with a huge hook, and it's followed by the hard-rocking single \"The Devil You Know\" and the now-classic \"Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't,\" which has already become a live staple. By the time you get to \"In the End,\" an epic ballad with a devastatingly heavy mid-tempo riff, Worship Music has already solidified its place as the best Anthrax record since Sound of White Noise.\n\nUnfortunately, that's also where the album starts to dip. After \"In the End,\" which is arguably the highlight of the record, things take a turn toward the forgettable. There's nothing bad about the second half of the album, per se, but it's mostly comprised of half-thrash and groove riffs that all eventually bleed together. A particular head-scratcher is the song \"Judas Priest,\" with a dull pace that sounds absolutely nothing like said band and feels like a wasted chance at a cool tribute.\n\nStill, prior to its release, to imagine Worship Music would be half career-highlight and half generic would've seemed too good to be true. In many ways, it was too good to be true.\n\nAnd yet somehow, it's true.\n\nAfter the release of Worship Music, I attended guitarist Scott Ian's book tour and had the chance to ask him about the album. I wanted to know if, within Anthrax, the success of Worship Music felt as implausible as it felt to outside observers and if the album had extra significance to him because of the circumstances it overcame. He enthusiastically nodded before I could even finish the question, commenting that Worship Music would've been a proud moment at any time in their career, but the fact that it came when it did made it a triumph for them.\n\nAnd for a band that had been through as many ups and downs as Anthrax, Worship Music is a triumph that's hard not to celebrate.\n\nSongs to check out: Earth on Hell, Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't, In the End\n",
        "\nThe nineties and early years of the new millennium weren't particularly great for American thrash metal veterans Anthrax. The band delivered the goods throughout the eighties that cemented its status as one of the very best genre bands in the world and the band has been releasing excellent music and playing outstanding concerts again throughout the last decade. Stomp 442 however is one of the low points in Anthrax's career for numerous reasons.\n\nFirst of all, the songwriting is lacking imagination. Most of the tracks here feature down-tuned chugging guitar play, barely audible bass guitar sounds, repetitive rhythmic drum patterns and strained vocals on the thin line between aggression and melody with occasional artificial effects layered upon it. The songs are rather on the shorter side with four and a half minutes on average and lack overtures, transitions, codas or any type of intriguing solo sections. \n\nWhile tracks like aggressive opener ''Random Acts of Senseless Violence'' or the more adventurous ''In a Zone'' show some promise on their own, they cant convince in the context of the elevated number of similarly sounding tunes. The loud production might have been a good idea on paper as it fits with the band's more aggressive attitude but the final result is headache-inducing and extremely hard to sit through. The dreadful cover artwork featuring a gigantic trash ball in a desolate space describes my feelings towards the record perfectly and might also indicate that Anthrax weren't exactly in a positive state of mind when recording that output. \n\nAnthrax had been a band walking perfectly on the thin line between passionate thrash metal tunes with inspired lyrics and party anthems with memorable choruses and instrumental passages. Stomp 442 is testament to a band that has lost its identity and features a more modern sound influenced by alternative rock bands of the nineties and the rise of groove metal but it desperately lacks the enthusiasm and positivism of yore. Those who like the aforementioned influences might appreciate Stomp 442 but fans of Anthrax's first five studio albums or the band's output since reuniting with Joey Belladonna will have a hard time getting used to those dystopian soundscapes.\n",
        "\nWorship Music, before it was released, was considered by metal media to be on a level with Chinese Democracy due to its very long incubation period. The period between We\u2019ve Come For You All and Worship Music had already seen the band go through singers, with John Bush leaving, Joey Belladonna coming and going, and Dan Nelson appearing on tour before the return of Joey Belladonna, who would go on to sing on the album. The album does show some DNA similar to the Bush years, and I could imagine him crooning over a fair amount of the songs, yet it strips away some of the alt and groove influences of Bush\u2019s years (which I always felt squandered his singing skills) for something thrashy yet still modern. So how does this work? \n\nAs stated, there are some songs on here that are closer to the John Bush era structure and style with a groovy and grungy style, especially in moody ballad Crawl, which like some of the Bush era songs received its share of remixes. There are some thrashers, though, with Earth on Hell and Fight \u2018Em Til You Can\u2019t (which definitely borrows from earlier song Gridlock). There are even a few songs that seem designed to let Belladonna flex his vocal folds, as shown on I\u2019m Alive and The Devil You Know. Another interesting standout is the Dio and Dimebag tribute In the End, with it\u2019s bouncy riff and soaring vocals, along with impassioned lyrics. In both composition and variety, the songs feel much more memorable than the Bush era, where they blended together more often than not.\n\nJoey still has a bit of that punky quality to his voice from his earlier years, though with more urgency rather than playfulness, and his vocals are layered a bit more than in the past. Frank Bello\u2019s chunky bass works to support the riffs and rhythm, with Scott Ian bringing riffs that go from punchy in those faster songs to bouncy and groovy. Charlie\u2019s drumming is always a star, working in a precise and punchy manner that is fittingly fast and brutal in the thrash songs. I always feel he does best in those situations, though there are some moments like the breakdown in Devil You Know and the intro to In the End that show he has strengths in slower, more rock laden drumming as well. Rob\u2019s solos do not stand out as much to me, though they are competent and they get the job done. It makes sense that this would be his last album with Anthrax, setting up his exit that led him to joining Volbeat. The other detail of note for this album are the intros, setting up songs with some extra ambience, which they would continue on the follow up For All Kings. Admittedly I end up skipping them with them being their own tracks. I\u2019m just too impatient for them!\n\nOverall, Worship Music is a fine album, though it is definitely a transitional piece for them. Anthrax has created their own modern heavy metal and thrash mix that they work on perfecting more in For All Kings, and I think this will very much be the style they go for moving forward. It\u2019s certainly a welcome breath of fresh air after the Bush years, and a sign of exciting things to come. Let\u2019s all stand at the altar of Anthrax and prepare for worship!\n",
        "\nOut of the so-called Big Four of thrash metal, Anthrax has always been the one I am most conflicted about. Admittedly, this is at least in part due to the fact that the songs that became staples for the band generally are not their strongest material or, even worse, covers that are done well, but should really have been sacrificed in favor of original material. In all honesty, Anthrax does have its fair share of excellent songs, but a release like their sophomore album \u2018Spreading The Disease\u2019 does raise an interesting question: is Anthrax really best as a thrash metal band?\n\n\u2018Spreading The Disease\u2019 was the first album the band recorded with Joey Belladonna on vocals and probably his best recorded performance. Despite having good singers throughout their career \u2013 I personally like John Bush even better \u2013 the band hardly ever wrote material to the strengths of their singers. Belladonna\u2019s background clearly is not in thrash metal, causing him to technically over-sing some of the material in here, but that is exactly what pushes tracks that otherwise would have been dull plodders like \u2018Madhouse\u2019 towards acceptable territory. While I\u2019m still not crazy about that song due to its terrible chorus, Belladonna\u2019s performance does make the pre-chorus incredible.\n\nApparently \u2018Madhouse\u2019 was received well enough to still be on the band\u2019s setlist nearly every night, something I will never understand. The other live staple from \u2018Spreading The Disease\u2019 is opening track \u2018A.I.R.\u2019, a fairly decent thrasher which shows some of the first glimpses of what a creative drummer Charlie Benante would become. Along with \u2018Aftershock\u2019, closer \u2018Gung-Ho\u2019 is without a doubt the best thrasher on the album, having some excellent riff work as well as a pre-chorus with a fantastic build-up. \u2018Stand Or Fall\u2019 has some cool fast thrash riffs as well, though its overly melodic chorus does take the sting out a bit.\n\nNow here is where my doubt if thrash metal is Anthrax\u2019s forte comes in. The best material on \u2018Spreading The Disease\u2019 leans towards more traditional forms of heavy metal. \u2018Lone Justice\u2019 in particular is a fantastic metal song with far more open riff work than the average thrasher, really allowing Belladonna to deliver his greatest vocal performance on the record. The powerful \u2018The Enemy\u2019 is practically eighties US power metal, while \u2018Armed And Dangerous\u2019 is probably Anthrax\u2019 most sophisticated song to date with its Queensr\u00ffche-ish first half. The mid-tempo \u2018Medusa\u2019 is another highlight. A simple composition, but the riffs are great and Belladonna\u2019s vocal approach is quite creative.\n\nDespite my reservations about Anthrax as a thrash band, \u2018Spreading The Disease\u2019 is clearly an excellent metal album with some of the band\u2019s best songwriting to date. \u2018Persistence Of Time\u2019 has it beat in terms of creativity, but \u2018Spreading The Disease\u2019 definitely has the best melodies on any Anthrax album. I also really love Frank Bello\u2019s fat bass tone here. Through the years, I have had plenty of discussions whether or not Anthrax deserves the praise they get. But after hearing \u2018Spreading The Disease\u2019, my conclusion is really that they do, just not for the material that is usually praised.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Lone Justice\u2019, \u2018Medusa\u2019, \u2018Armed And Dangerous\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nChange can be beneficial or destructive, though it can be stipulated that inorganic change has a greater tendency towards the latter, at least in terms of evolution within a band's signature sound. Though few bands attempt to disguise a shift in direction, there are some that are just so clumsy in their delivery of a new sound that it literally screams desperate sellout right in your face. If there is one album that stands above the rest in how blatantly it conveys this lack of artistic integrity, it's the often dismissed but occasional defended sixth LP in Anthrax's discography Sound Of White Noise. Originally hitting the market in the still grunge-dominated landscape of 1993, it embodies one of the most bizarre compromises between the band's thrash metal past and the flavor of the moment, splashing a gallon of Seattle-colored paint on top of a canvass that still comes off as within the parameters of a New York thrash album. In some sense, it could be seen as an innovative step in metal's forward progression, but not long into its presentation it reveals itself to be one of many dead-ends in the faltering metal scene of the mid-1990s.\n\nThe mystique regarding how grunge rose from a backwater fad in the Pacific Northwest to commercial hegemony is largely dispelled when looking at the concurrent/convenient disintegration of the classic lineups of several metal mainstays such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Nevertheless, the exodus of Joey Belladonna from the fold in 1992 alone doesn't account for this auditory failure, in fact, Belladonna would have been equally up to the task of singing on a grunge album as his replacement when looking at his subsequent solo work. Likewise, while former Armored Saint front man John Bush's punishingly unoriginal amalgam of Layne Staley and Scott Weiland that graces this album reeks of a corporate boardroom decree, his performance is reasonably adequate for what it is and doesn't really serve as a detriment to the album. The true culprit behind this farce of an LP is Scott Ian, or to be more specific, his desire not to lose major label backing, which results in the construction of an album that betrays a band trying to be something that they're not, namely an Alice In Chains knockoff.\n\nFrom the very beginning of things, it's pretty clear that Anthrax was acting under some level of duress, because they display zero competency in emulating the style they are attempting to appropriate. Following just under a minute of ambient noise that is about as pleasant as a dozen tigers clawing mercilessly at a giant chalkboard, the opening riff work of \"Potters Field\" comes blaring in like a lost B-side from the Persistence Of Time recording sessions. Despite taking its time to get going, this song ends up raging with almost the same ferocity as something heard out of Cyclone Temple, though the whole thing is dreadfully hamstrung by an extremely fuzzy, muffled production that could best described as a bad attempt at aping Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger sound. It's a crying shame because this otherwise competent, albeit measured thrasher, alongside \"Room For One More\", and most of what occurs from \"Invisible\" until the end of the album could have culminated in the best thrash metal album of 1993 had it gotten a meatier drum mix and a more forceful guitar tone.\n\nYet when putting aside the horrendous production job that should have resulted in Dave Jerden and his entire crew being keelhauled alongside the jerkoffs running Electra Records, there are some objectively bad offerings on here that point towards the sad state that Anthrax would find themselves in when Stomp 442's proto-Limp Bizkit rubbish came to light. The clunky mid-paced mess that is \"Only\" is a full on Dirt ripoff, complete with Bush trying (and failing) to emulate Staley and Cantrell's signature chorus harmonies via overdubs, while the goofy rap metal joke \"Hy Pro Glo\" is so cringe-inducing that only the most insatiable of masochists need try to resist the urge to slam the skip button. \"Black Lodge\" also borrows pretty heavily from the Alice In Chains playbook with some occasional hints of STP's Core emerging here and there, and basically amounts to a 5 minutes plus snooze-fest of a ballad with Dan Spitz occasionally trying to brighten things with some minimalist lead harmonies. But the worst offender of the bunch is the lame groove metal closer \"This Is Not An Exit\", which is about 3 minutes too long and is so needlessly repetitive that it hurts.\n\nDespite how lackluster and disappointing the actual contents of this album are, it's understandable why it still has a contingent of defenders, as this was likely the most metal thing to come out of '93 that wasn't Cannibal Corpse yet was about as visible. The entire metal scene in America was basically being held hostage by a hostile recording industry and a belligerent musical competitor that had little to no respect for anything that wasn't from their depressing corner of the country. Nevertheless, there is a reason why almost none of the songs featured on this album or any other subsequent album with John Bush at the helm have been featured live since Anthrax's classic lineup reunited in 2005. It's too much of a product of its time, and that time is one that the vast majority of the metal world would rather forget, and for very good reason. Somewhere within this awkward 57 minute long album is a 38 minute long thrash metal beast trying to get out, but it's been so hopelessly muffled that absent the band rerecording this album and dropping 3 or 4 of the songs in favor of better material, it can't really be appreciated as such. Thrash metal fans who have never heard this would do well not to bother with it, while those who have would be best served by forgetting it along with everything that followed up until 2005.\n",
        "\nIt goes without saying that the 2000s was a time of rebirth for metal after having suffered for nearly the entirety of the 90s as persona non grata west of the Atlantic, but many of the old guard that originally flourished during the 80s seemed to enter this newfound era of metallic ascendance kicking and screaming. Case and point, the once commercially formidable player in thrash metal's Big 4 known as Anthrax, who went through some of the most blatant exercises in stylistic contortion in order to stay relevant through the days of grunge and groove. To be fair, the slow but steady rise of the 2000s thrash revival hadn't really made a huge impact in the continental United States by 2003, but as a band that had toured extensively through Europe and South America, these old time New York thrashers had to have been aware of it. Nevertheless, this band's final hurrah with replacement vocalist John Bush in We've Come For You All billed itself as a return to the high period of the late 80s, but sadly was far more in line with what Machine Head was doing at the same time, i.e. the opposite of the good old days.\n\nThis album is not quite a complete turkey, in fact, after some deliberation between this offering and 1993's grungy sellout album Sound Of White Noise I'd call it the least terrible of a decade long low point in Anthrax's career. For his part, Bush sounds far less like an overt clone of Layne Staley and has mercifully moved away from the lousy Phil Anselmo impersonation that he'd trotted out on Volume 8: The Threat Is Real. Whether this was a happy coincidence or the result of the brief reunion that Armored Saint had a few years prior reminding him what singing actually sounds like, Bush is mostly on point in his capacity as the band's de facto leader, even if he's still carrying some baggage from his earlier work with Anthrax for purposes of conforming himself to Scott Ian's still groove-steeped, trend-hopping songwriting of the time. Likewise, the rest of the band holds up their end of things sufficiently, with newly recruited lead guitarist Rob Caggiano, who was clearly cut from a nu-metal pedigree, also throwing in some solos that amount to a reasonably competent emulation of Dimebag Darrel's signature sound.\n\nOn the positive end of things, a duo of faster thrashing monsters in \"What Doesn't Die\" and \"Black Dahlia\" definitely throw in some hints of the more groovy thrashing days of Persistence Of Time, with the latter occasionally dabbling in some blast-happy grindcore moments. \"Any Place But Here\" takes on a mid-paced, rocking feel that's a bit closer to the better moments of Metallica's Load era and Bush's generally solid vocal presentation helps keep it from feeling too repetitive, while the title anthem \"W.C.F.Y.A.\" could be likened to a slightly overlong but mostly on point retread of territory originally explored on Machine Head's \"Davidian\". The all mixed up, jazzy groove machine \"Nobody Knows Anything\" is probably among the most overt throwbacks to the grungy Sound Of White Noise days, but Benante's insanely busy drumming basically carries the whole thing. Even the comical hard rocking vibes of \"Cadillac Rock Box\" has this sort of fun-loving charm to it that cancels out the cringe-inducing spoken intro, and Caggiano's bluesy soloing swagger meshed with a Dimebag-inspired noisy gloss shines pretty brightly.\n\nThat being said, this album's ultimately downfall is that it's utterly schizophrenic, as Ian and company can't fully commit to their older thrash style and find themselves repeatedly backsliding into the stagnant drudgery of their late 90s era. Some of the time this manifests in ridiculous fits of overt self-parody like the goofy alternative rock nightmare \"Safe Home\", which sounds like it was lifted off of Creed's Weathered during that horrendous chorus section, and never really locates anything resembling a metallic foundation. The extremely crappy nu-metal romp \"Superhero\", which was supposedly meant to be a revisiting of Anthrax's late 80s glory, sounds halfway like it wants to be a bad KoRn ripoff or an even worse Machine Head knockoff circa Supercharger, complete with the grating hip-hop moments. Even when some of these otherwise throwaway songs that occupy more than half the album start on a fairly positive note (namely \"Taking The Music Back\" and \"Strap It On\"), it ends up degenerating into modern rock mush the minute that Bush's otherwise solid vocals enter the fray, almost as if he is sucking the metal out of the instrumentation in order to strengthen his own performance.\n\nTo put it in the most condensed manner possible, this is the best of the worst in Anthrax's checkered era without Joey Belladonna or Neil Turbin at the helm. It's not without a handful of bright spots, but most of what occupies the better moments of this album were done far better on the eventual follow up and true return to thrashing form in 2011's Worship Music. Some bitter clingers out there from the days of over-priced flannels and Seattle-centric culture might object to the thought, but there is a reason why none of the songs on here or any other album going back to Sound Of White Noise have been featured in Anthrax's set since 2005. It's very much a product of its time, and it was largely a bad one at that, particularly if one wanted something resembling competent metal as the U.S.A. had provided prior to the mid-1990s. It's a cut above the competition from 2003, which was basically Machine Head's post-mallcore dud Through The Ashes Of Empires and Dime's atrocious nu-metal abortion with Damageplan New Found Power, but ultimately it's the difference between getting a Dutch oven from Honey Boo Boo's mom vs. being dropped into a lake of raw sewage.\n",
        "\nAnthrax, the masterminds behind 'Among the Living', 'State of Euphoria' and 'Spreading the Disease', have been around for over 3 decades and went through the 90s even worse than other, ekhm, 'BIG FOUR' counterparts - they basically became forgotten, releasing mediocre groove metal release one after another with vocalist that probably should stay with Armoured Saints. So I had quite high expectations for 'Worship Music' - Joey Belladonna is back, baby, to further prove he's an american's version of Bruce Dickinson. Too bad we're talking about the modern Bruce Dickinson here...\n\nHonestly, there's no other way to put it. Joey Belladonna sucks. How come a guy who was probably the most classic singer in thrash (along side with David White) could went through such a downgrade? I mean, he wasn't lazying around after leaving Anthrax, he actually had a solo career. I used to think it's because he just didn't practice singing in a long time. If you're hoping for good vocal perfomance on 'Worship Music', then don't. Joey sings like he's about to die any minute, but just like a cockroach, he refuses to go down. His perfomances that technically should sound melodic, are tiresome and in the end, not engaging. And the ones that should be aggressive, ends up being underwhelming, when you think of vocalists that can actually sound threating, like Mark Osegueda, Sy Keeler or Tom Angelripper. It's not as bad when there's good music to support it, but this album doesn't offer much to make Belladonna's dismal vocals not annoying.\n\nWe start off with intro called 'Worship', which later transitions into thrash assault 'Earth on Hell'. And there's quite a lot wrong with it. The transitions between changes in tempo are quite baffling. I heard times and times again how awesome Charlie Benante is, but if it was my first contact with Anthrax, I could never tell. This is almost like Lars Ulrich level of drumming here, and just because he does blast beats and stays in the tempo with the rest, it doesn't make him a great drummer. I wanted to say couple of words about Tom Hunting's drumming, which also seemed overrated for me, but this song alone makes me want to apologize to Tom for ever thinking about doing so. Tons of other drummers can do what Benante tried to accomplish here, so I'm really baffled so many people are giving him so much credit. And when I'm reminded of the time he covered 'Fast as a Shark' with Metal Allegiance... Oh God.\n\nLet's just say 'Earth on Hell' blows. A fairly forgettable thrash opener with baffling changes in tempo, cringy chorus and almost non-existing lead guitar. 'The Devil You Know' is actually a much better, heavy metal experience. Even Belladonna's voice isn't that painful. I can actually jam to it and not feel ashamed of doing so. And it has a quite catchy chorus! How come this song wasn't the album's opener? Even 'Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't' isn't half-bad, it nicely mixes speed with melody, although the chorus becomes a bit too cheesy, even for Anthrax's standards. Same can be said about 'I'm Alive'.\n\nBut this is where the album falls apart. I absolutely LOATHE when the metal albums can't decide if they want to be full thrash, full heavy or groove, so they just mix it all together. It almost always ends up being a failure, because there's no coherent vision for album, and we all know that appealing to everyone ends up appealing no one. So nobody is satisfied with results in the end... Speaking of it, 'In the End', how come Gary Holt contribute to Anthrax's album? I swear to God, this is like 'Funeral Hymn', if you replace the awesome riff that Exodus song had with something that's far more forgettable. And also if you would keep the song in the same, bored pace. FOR ALMOST 7 MINUTES. Is this a joke I don't get?\n\nWhat's next, 'The Giant'? My God... What am I even suppose to call it, 'nu-groove'? This stuff sounds like someone listened to way too much Linkin Park, Pantera and Limp Bizkit combined and forgot they're in goddamn Anthrax. The chorus is the thing that really kills it, I mean, Anthrax was never the most aggressive thing ever, but those melodies suck! If it wasn't for crisp and meaty production, I could probably mistake 'Crawl' for some Disney Channel TV show that has those fake-ass \"rock\" bands. 'Revolution Screams' is neither a good thrasher nor a good heavy metal song. Its shifts between slower and faster tempos are again ridiculous, and I really can't see the appeal of this.\n\n'Judas Priest', despite looking like a Judas Priest tribute (and you know how I feel about \"tributes\" from big guys like Anthrax or Metallica), isn't one, actually. Although it's definitely rooted in british heavy metal.\nEDIT: My bad, this song actually is a nod to Judas Priest, from sound to its lyrics. Which are, of course, mostly making *wink wink* references to Priest's songs as if it's a goddamn movie based on a video game. So it's not all that better.\nIt does end up being a bit repetetive, so any good intentions this song, are drowned in 6-minute runtime, which could've been easily reduced to barely over 4 and be way more impactful. I mean, this albums already has 13 songs (2 of which are some pretentious, pointless intros), was it necessary to have 10th track to be that long, with 3 more still about to happen? I begin to wonder if my joke about Holt's contribution to this album was actually a joke...\n\nOut of 9 other songs, only 'The Constant' doesn't give me a headache because of all bad decision made during songwriting process. While it still suffers from the problems that 'Earth on Hell' and 'Revolution Screams' suffers - mainly no fluid transition in tempo changes - is backed up with great riffs and nice addition of acoustic guitar in chorus. My congratulations, guys, you haven't fucked up 4 songs. OUT OF 11. Great. What the hell happened here?\n\nThis is exactly why I despise albums that try to be everything. When you try to combine few different styles into one album, it turns into a goddamn mess. There's no coherent vision for the album as a whole, is just a collection of songs from which only few (or rather one, as 'Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't' is the lucky fan favorite here) will be a concert classic. I prefer when an album feels like it had a purpose of releasing, that those songs combined together are on an album for a reason, other than to pan out its runtime and not just release EPs. But that feeling doesn't exist on 'Worship Music', is just a handful collection of songs that either don't even sound like Anthrax during any era, or it's underwhelming to say the least.\n\nAnd don't you dare pull up a \"it's an experiment\" card on this. People are criticizing the \"experimental\" stuff for a reason. Think of it as a movie director, or a video game developer, that excells at making light-hearted FPS games/action flicks. And then they decided to make a serious, and, ekhm, \"MATURE\" drama/art game. And all the flaws that people prefered to ignore in their previous movies/games (because their purpose are to entertain), are becoming way more visible in more serious material. This goes the same for a music. Certain bands just simply don't get what makes genres they experiment with compelling in the first place. Or choose genres that suck to begin with. This should have been a comeback of Anthrax in its full force, to once again become a force to be reckon with. But listening to 'Worship Music' makes me wish that Anthrax should have disbanded after 2003 and focus on Stormtroopers of Death. And have them replaced by Exodus, how come a first ever thrash metal band not be a part of Big Four?\n\nThere's a certain line in Lich King's song 'Take the Paycheck' on their 5th album 'The Omniclasm' - \"Forty minutes of you phoning it in/While the label claims \u201ca true return to form!\u201d/But you didn\u2019t try, and you won\u2019t again/Doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019ll sell like a storm\". The rest of the song makes it clear it's not only about Metallica, but other bands as well. And honestly, in case of Anthrax, no truer words have ever been said. Well, only the 'forty minutes' part doesn't match, cause this album is a hour-long travesty. And it did \"sell like a storm\", debuting at number 12 in the Billboard 200. And it was considered a \"true return to form\" by magazines and such....\n\nAnd here I thought \"I'm the Man\" or \"Bring the Noise\" were supposed to be a joke.\n",
        "\nMetallica, Slayer, Megadeth & Anthrax, the Big Four of Thrash Metal!... Ha, good one. That's the funniest shit I've seen since seeing Kong shoving a tree down Godzilla's throat (or an axe, if you've seen their latest rematch). Honestly, as of right now, only Megadeth seems to still fit the part of this whole \"idea\", as Slayer doesn't exist anymore, Metallica only scratches the surface of thrash and so does Anthrax. But hey, they apparently sell the biggest number of records, unlike other bands being much closer to thrash, like Death Angel, Overkill, Testament or Exodus, so it makes sense, I guess...? Whatever this marketing crap is, the idea of this four bands uniting for making a tour around the world was born. And it ended up in recording this DVD, which I manage to bought some long time ago. However, I feel like I could spent that money on buying an actual good DVD, if other bands like Overkill or Death Angel were more open to the idea of fucking doing them.\n\nChronologically, I should start with Anthrax, but I prefer to start from Slayer. \"Fucking Slayer\" (or \"SLAYER, kurwa!\" from where I come from), I always cringe when I hear that chant. It makes me feel like those people have no idea that thrash needs more than aggression and speed to be great. While it could seem like I hate Slayer - no, not really. When they actually put some effort, they really can produce some relatively good music, as shown with 'Show No Mercy', 'Hell Awaits' (which are two albums completely overlooked on this show - what are the odds!), 'South of Heaven', 'Seasons in the Abyss' and even 'God Hates Us All'. It's mostly the cult following of 'Reign in Blood' that really gets under my nerves, because this album only has hollow aggression and speed to offer. And nothing else. But that didin't stopped metalheads from calling it \"magnum opus\" of thrash and compare every competent album to this mediocrity. But that's a story for another time.\n\nHonestly, this show is really weak. Not only the setlist sucks, offering very little variety out of Slayer's entire catalogue (it's mostly the big hits from 'Reing In Blood', 'South of Heaven' and 'Seasons in the Abyss', with three song from then-latest release 'World Painted Blood', 'Disciple' from 'God Hates Us All' and 'Jihad' from 'Christ Illusion'), but the song performances are also lacking punch. Hannemann and King were never anything special, but now they've really set the bar to the new low. Solos feel sloppy, as if playing those songs thousand times wasn't enough. I guess it's a nice thing to see Slayer in the iconic OG line-up before Jeff passed away, but to be honest, these guys are/were past their prime. Well, most of them, because Dave Lombardo is Dave Lombardo and Dave Lombardo is fucking awesome. Even if Slayer's music doesn't give him much of a room to vary his playstyle. Arguably, the lowest point of this show is Tom Araya. His vocals are just a pain to listen to. At some moments he sound like he's struggling for breath. Maybe he should have taken some vocal lessons to learn how to utilize your energy during singing better. Hell, maybe that would let him do the proper high-pitched screams again. \n\nAnother problem is the sound, which is quite muddy. While on 'Vile' by Cannibal Corpse it works for album's atmosphere, here it's just annoying. Live perfomances for me should sound clean enough to hear every member doing their work. Only drums sounds a bit passable, while King's guitar seem to overpower Hannemann's guitar in the mix, and Tom Araya seems to be completely lost, both vocally and with bass guitar. For better or worse, it's perhaps a good thing Slayer ended their career. Araya seems happy with retirement, King can play his horrible solos elsewhere (which I pity to whoever decides to join his new pet project) and Lombardo provides his skills for Suicidal Tendencies and Philm. Overall, I rate it around 35%. Too much bullshit for me to recommend. 'Decade of Aggression' is much likely a better choice.\n\nNext in the list, Anthrax. And again, it's pretty \"meh\". The musicianship is much tighter than Slayer, though. And as long as Charlie Benante isn't allowed anywhere close to 'Fast as a Shark' by Accept, I'll take him. But there are two things dragging this show down. First, setlist. I'll just gonna ask, where is 'Among the Living' (the song)? Where's 'A.I.R.'? Or 'Gung-Ho'? Or anything from 'Persistence of Time'? You had the time to play a song from much rather despised John Bush era, but nothing from 5th album? Not even a cheesy 'Belly of the Beast'? I guess that Joe Jackson cover of 'Got the Time' is the representative of 'Persistence of Time', but I'll rather have an original song here.\n\nBut even with better setlist the show would still be disappointing, because Joey Belladonna can't sing to save his life anymore. While the band seem to have a lot of fun performing the songs, Belladona drags the entire show down. In the 80s he may seemed a little bit like Bruce Dickinson knock-off, here it's even more evident, since his vocals downgraded just as much as Bruce's. It's again painful to listen, especially during 'Heaven and Hell' cover. Sorry Joey, but Mark Osegueda is the only one who can fucking nail this song. And again, Belladonna is struggling to keep his breath during singing a lot of times. And people have balls to say they're the best of out the 4. Yeah, fuck no.\n\nOne advantage they have over the rest is sound, which is clean, and sleak, and exactly how a modern live show should fucking sound like! It's right there with first part of 'The World is Ours' by Motorhead, 'Dark Roots of Thrash' by Testament or both Metallica's DVD from year prior. The drums have enough punch in them, the bass is audible, and guitars are just perfect. The only complaint is Belladona's voice being a bit hidden in the mix, although that might be a good thing... Overall, 50%. The musicianship and sound can't save a show with this disgraceful vocal performance. And to think I used to say this show was the best. What a joke. Get yourselves a copy of 'Alive 2', it's a much better Anthrax expierience with Belladonna that doesn't sound like a watered down version of modern Bruce Dickinson. Who already is a watered down version of classic Bruce, which is... Yikes.\n\nOkay then, Metallica. The biggest out of 4, the most recongizable, and of course have to put out the biggest and longest show. Well, I'm not so sure about that. Problem one, the setlist became way too formulaic at the time. We start with 'Creeping Death', so of course it only makes sense to follow-up with 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', correct that with 'Fuel' and a forgotten gem from 'Ride the Lightning' or '...And Justice for All', a ballad (at least 'One' appears much later on), a 'Death Magnetic' song (it's not 'Broken, Beat & Scarred', thank God), followed up by 'Cyanide', 'Sad But True', another ballad, 'All Nightmare Long', ANOTHER BALLAD, 'Master of Puppets', thrashy song with intro (and it's not overlooked 'Fight Fire With Fire' or 'Battery'), duo 'Nothing Else Matters' and 'Enter Sandman', cover song, and two 'Kill 'Em All' songs, the second one being obligatory 'Seek and Destroy'.\n\nI mean, at this point Metallica released 2 official albums which have this setlist structure, and countless of bootlegs from other shows. How hard it was to do some fucking changes? It wasn't until 2014/2015 when they're finally shaken the formula up, but seeing almost exact same-y setlist for 3rd time, with few song appearing on the THIRD RELEASE IN A ROW, makes me absolutely LIVID, to put it mildly. Like, why should I buy this release over, let's say, 'Orgullo, Pasion y Gloria' or 'Francais Pour Une Nuit'? Because without it, I'm only losing Big Four's joined performance of 'Am I Evil' (and aside from Lombardo, Slayer didn't even bother to show up, so fuck'em) and other three concerts, but aside from Megadeth, I wouldn't cry over losing them. And right now, I'm kind sick to death of hearing 'Blackened' or 'Cyanide', and don't even get me started on fucking 'One'. Why not give 'My Apocalypse' or 'The Shortest Straw' some exposure? Yeah, I know they're on 'Quebec Magnetic'. But before 2012, QM was nowhere near close release, so again, what does Metallica fan gains by buying this release?\n\nProblem two, perfomances. I know it's cheap to make fun of Lars' poor drumming skills and Kirk's excessive attachment to wah pedal, but it's just too easy. Apparently, they did improve in the last few years on 'Hardwired' tours, but it's all too little, too late. And Kirk is still unable to play one solo without his livesafer. Something that was charming in the 80s, is now pathetic. Thankfully, Rob and James are league above the other half of the Metallica. I mean, Rob comes from Infectious Groove, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Label Society and played for Ozzy fucking Osbourne, so what else is there to say? Metallica always had a nose for great bassists, and Rob is no different (even if Burton's creative inputs and Newsted devilish backing vocals will always be missed). James was always a tight rhythm guitarist, sometimes even providing some great solos ('Master of Puppets' and 'Nothing Else Matters' being most prominent examples) and while his voice is rather a huge downgrade from 80s, he's nowhere near as bad as Araya or Belladonna. And he's without a doubt a great frontman, encouraging audience to sing with him, giving some peptalks and stuff.\n\nProblem three, sound. While I can compliment 'Orgullo, Pasion y Gloria' and 'Francais Pour Une Nuit' for their clean and sleak sound, this one however starts to show some cracks. The drums feel like they're trying to remind the 'And Justice for All' era, to which I say: \"STOP!\", while the bass seem to trying to find its place in the mix. That might be only complaints about the sound, cause guitars and vocals are good enough. And of course, the 'Am I Evil' with other bands is a highlight for a lot of people, but my would rather be 'All Nightmare Long' - hearing this song live every time feels great, and even with those performers this song's atmosphere is more than enough to make it worth a listen. My rating for this show is somewhere around 65%, 70% at most. I'm getting sick of hearing 'Blackened', 'One' and 'Cyanide' on each of the DVD they've released. And Lars and Kirk should really start to suck it up and practicing a lot, because if it wasn't for James and Rob, they would probably be thrown out of the band long time ago.\n\nI decided to save the best for the last, i.e. Megadeth. Hell yes, that's one show that I can't complain about much. Or rather, I'd need to resort to nitpicking to actually find flaws. Setlist is great for a show that lasts only 1 hour (although 'Holy Wars' being played twice is questionable for me), the musicianship is top notch, and the sound is great. Well, okay, now for complaints, number 1, lack of Dave's interaction with crowd. I know he's not as great of a vocalist, but as a charismatic persona, he should interact with audience more. Here he only says couple of words before 'Head Crusher' and that's it. Live performances have this advantage of interacting with the crowd, yet Mustaine didn't decided to use that. Shame, cause this show, while being fantastic, definitely needs to catch a breath. Number 2, while drums and bass sound fucking perfect ('Hook in a Mouth' opening proves that), the guitars feel muddled, and sound like they've caught a stage fright...? Although it's probably due to rain during the perfomance, and some nasty weather is not enough to spook out Megadeth, so I can forgive that. Aside from that, though, I have no complaints. 90% from me. Funnily enough, I considered the show to be the weakest out of entire 4 back in the day I bought this DVD. How the turns have tabled indeed...\n\nHonestly, 'The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria' is rather a disappointing release. 1 show is a complete disaster, other two are hampered by certain musicians, and only one actually delievers on what fans want. This is really far from what, in comparison, Testament or Motorhead can offer in terms of live perfomance, and it's definitely inferior to all of those bands' previous live recordings, 'Decade of Aggresion' and 'Live Shit' especially. I would just recommend to check out those bands' other DVDs, because it's really not worth it just for the sake of Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Dave Lombardo performing 'Am I Evil'. Well, that, and the fact that these bands aren't really the 'Big Four of Thrash'.\n",
        "\nWell, first off, Phil and Dime featuring on this album: a great addition here! Even if the listener wasn't aware of such fact, he/she could clearly spot the PanterA touch in this record: those down-tuned heavy-ass grimy screechy guitars (carrying a high dosage of gain on that amp), mixed up with those trash can-like drums \u2014plastic-thin bass drum, low-end snare tone, and okay toms\u2014 with a low-toned bass guitar underneath it and hardcore-styled vocals on top (production-wise, it sounds like Far Beyond Driven). Do not get me wrong though, it actually sounds freaking good! Crank Volume 8 up on a nice pair of speakers and you'll have some fun ( I usually have fun when I put this record on the player. Plus, the lyrics are quite catchy as well).\n\nBut yes, it is a nu metal-ish groove type of album. A subgenre that usually sucks for the most part due to the lack of ideas and creativity, bearing dumbed down staccato lyrics, monotone riffs, that pretty much tries to sound \"tuff\" and heavy for the sake of sounding tough and heavy. Groovy music isn't my cup of tea. However, the thing that distinguishes this record from the chugging trend going on at the time is that Anthrax has good riffage\u2014really, Scott Ian can deliver very decently! That dude can shred, fast pick, perform nice chord progression and he's had beefy guitar tones all Anthrax's lifetime\u2014combined with Charlie's top-notch drumming, and their musical ideas just rendered a nice-flowing groovy record. I mean, it's a speed/thrash band trying to groove and they succeeded at it. Speed and thrash metal are intrinsically full of amazing song structures and ideas. These guys plainly attempted a trendy style going on in the '90s bearing their great ideas (even though they added that chug-chug style on top, it still sounds good). All of those nu-metal '90s bands, on the other hand, are just groovy nu-metal spewing groovy nu-metal.\n\nNevertheless, I grasp everyone's rant on this album: it lacks a direction. It's a bit random. I mean, Crush is a thrashy/groovy track with unique drumming; Cupajoe and 604 are punk-ish; Toast to the Extras and Harms Away are country; Catharsis is a happy rocky song; Born Again Idiot is a groovy punk(having quite funny lyrics, I might add); Killing Box is a groovy track with a happy chorus (bearing a resemblance to Sugar Ray). So, yes, what is this record again? A hardcore country groovy album? A groovy punk-ish country record? Go figure. It definitely gets lost halfway through. It so isn't what you'd hear from old Anthrax, but NOT a throwaway! The structured riffs are there, the fat bass is there, the drum fills are there. The ideas are all scattered around there, you just need to grasp them and put them together. It flows nicely one way or another. Even though I'm not fond of country music, I still like their country attempts, simply because it's Anthrax. These fellows have a musical essence that sounds pleasing. Really nice ideas. Passionate musicians. The creativity they've put on most of their songs is deserving of awe (and headbanging). Again, it's their ESSENCE. It's the way Charlie delivers super-fast double bass and drum fills. It's the way Scott progresses on power chords while fast picking or down picking. It's how Frankie completes their songs\u2014I mostly mentioned these 3 members because they're undoubtedly the heart of the band\u2014 these guys can deliver good fucking metal (that doesn't mean I enjoy ALL of their material. No. Persistence of Time is meh\u2014 quite an odd record\u2014 albeit the majority of their full-lengths are tight). \n\nAnthrax, Sodom, and Overkill (definitely Overkill) are the only bands that I can think of succeeding at grooving their asses off. They sound metal (even having the groovy feel to it, they're still not boring). Even with a lack of direction here, it showcases what these guys are capable of without completely losing their way. A huge Anthrax fan \u2014such as myself\u2014 shouldn't avoid this release. It is an acquired taste but it grows on you.\n\nPS: Cupajoe is like revisiting S.O.D.'s Speak English or Die album.\n",
        "\nMusic of Mass Destruction is a live album recorded by American thrash metal veterans Anthrax when John Bush was still fronting the band. This package includes a DVD with the entire concert consisting of sixteen songs as well as two additional tunes and a single disc with twelve tracks. The first minor complaint I have is that it would have been amazing to have all eighteen tracks on CD or at least all sixteen songs from the show in Chicago.\n\nOn the positive side, the band's performance is celebratory, energetic and passionate from start to finish. This includes recent material such as powerful opener ''What Doesn't Die'', tracks from the middle years such as gloomy fan favourite ''Only'' and classics from the early years like the heavy ''I Am the Law''. The drum play is versatile, tight and dynamic. The bass guitar provides rhythms and energy in every single track. The lead guitar work is heavy and tight. The lead guitar and solos add memorable memories to the energetic songs and are performed skillfully. I'm not a big fan of Anthrax' studio records featuring John Bush because the songwriting is quite inconsistent but he is a variable, consistent and charismatic singer in concert and has excellent interactions with the crowd as well.\n\nThere is only one element that doesn't sit very well with me. John Bush praises the American military and claims that soldiers are fighting for American freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq as he dedicates the song ''Refuse to Be Denied'' to them. First of all, such political statements shouldn't be made during metal shows in the first place. Secondly, Anthrax has always been a band with anti-war themes as witnessed in songs like ''A Skeleton in the Closet'', so it's rather disconcerting to hear their singer speak positively about war in this case. Thirdly and lastly, this might obviously be a cultural phenomenon since North Americans regularly express pride for their veterans and speak heroically about war while Europeans rather tend to criticize armed conflicts in general and have not all supported American missions in Afghanistan and Iraq but John Bush's statement just sounds like an odd bit of patriotism to me. In my opinion, killing people in a foreign country thousands of miles away doesn't have much to do with protecting democracy and freedom at home but I can understand why people with a different culture and upbringing might disagree with me here.\n\nDespite that noteworthy awkward moment in the concert and the missed occasion to feature all live tracks on two discs, Anthrax' Music of Mass Destruction is a diversified, energetic and entertaining live album with cuts from recent releases, obscure records and classics from the early years. The production sounds organic and the crowd in Chicago is participating cheerfully. This is an excellent release for fans of old date but also an appropriate introduction to the band for newcomers who discovered thrash metal due to the genre's renaissance in the new millennium. This live album has aged very well and is still tearing heads off while the pandemic prevents us from attendings concerts and festivals these days.\n",
        "\nIn the wake of Metallica's game-changing \"Black Album,\" virtually every major thrash band toned down their music and adopted new styles, hoping to maintain relevance in a post-Sandman metal world. Megadeth conjured Countdown to Extinction, Testament practiced The Ritual, Exodus delivered us Force of Habit and the list goes on and on and on.\n\nFor some bands, the change was a disaster.\n\nFor Anthrax, it was a triumph.\n\nSound of White Noise was a pivotal record for Anthrax. Not only was it their Black Album, it was also their first album with their new singer, Armored Saint's John Bush. A transitional album is one thing, but a transitional album with a new singer? There was every chance this album would be a wreck, and for thrash purists, it was. But for those open to a band trying new things, Sound of White Noise was a creative rebirth and revitalization with songs that are just too good to deny.\n\nThe album starts with\u2014what else\u2014but some white noise and a voice preparing you for \"a journey into sound.\" The static breaks with Charlie Benante's snare as the band launches into \"Potters Field,\" and the tone is immediately set. This song has an infectious, stomping post-thrash riff that, while slower than the band's prior work, somehow sounds exactly like Anthrax. The \"darker\" vibe of Persistence of Time has also been maintained, as John Bush laments that while he \"was born to save you,\" he was also \"born to die.\"\n\nSpeaking of which, John Bush sounds phenomenal on this record. Personally, I'm a much bigger fan of the Belladonna Era, but Bush's thicker, grittier voice is a perfect match for the tone Anthrax is going for on Sound of White Noise.\n\n\"Potters Field\" goes right into \"Only,\" which Metallica's James Hetfield has described as a \"perfect song.\" It's an absolute heavy metal anthem, its driving riff giving way to one of the band's most memorable choruses. And again, as much as I love Joey Belladonna, it's hard to imagine his over-the-top voice working as well on a song as serious and heartfelt as \"Only.\" John Bush really shines here, erasing any doubts new listeners might've had about the new guy.\n\n\"Room for One More\" kicks in next, giving Sound of White Noise a nearly flawless 1-2-3 punch. And from there, the album just keeps hammering you with hook after hook. \"Hy Pro Glo\" has a fun start/stop riff that builds up to a chugging break, before \"1000 Points of Hate\" comes in with a riff that wouldn't sound out of place on Persistence of Time. This underscores something that's often overlooked about Sound of White Noise\u2014yes, it's a different sound, but it's a fairly faithful evolution of what they'd been doing for years. It's an evolved sound, but not a changed sound.\n\nWell, except for \"Black Lodge.\"\n\nAnother one of the album's highlights, this is a dark, somber ballad with a beautiful vocal performance from Bush, gradually escalating to a crescendo of chugging riffs and guitar harmonies. This is exactly the kind of material Anthrax could never pull off in the past, as their good-time thrash didn't translate to darker melodies as well as their peers. Just a beautiful song, and it's brilliantly followed by the album's fastest track in \"Burst,\" an apparent peace offering to the thrashers.\n\nSound of White Noise is a divisive album among metal fans, as most of these pseudo-Black albums are. If you're a thrash fan who only wants to hear thrash from thrash bands, you're going to hate Sound of White Noise and that's cool. You might not like the style personally, but to deny its craftsmanship would frankly be disingenuous. The songs are honed to perfection, the performances are flawless and unlike the next few Anthrax albums, the stylistic change is clearly inspired. As a mainstream heavy metal album, this is almost as good as it gets.\n\nSo jump on the Sound of White Noise bandwagon. There's always room for one more.\n\nSongs to check out: Potters Field, Only, Room for One More\n",
        "\nEvery band has like seven \"return to form\" albums that aren't quite returns to form.\n\nThis is one of those albums.\n\nOf course, in 2003, even an album like that was a godsend coming from Anthrax. These once-mighty metal legends had succumbed to bland songs (Stomp 442), stylistic confusion (Volume 8) and a long list of professional and personal setbacks, so you can imagine the reaction when the band dropped \"What Doesn't Die\" like a thrash warhead on an army of fans who expected a potato gun.\n\n\"What Doesn't Die\" is not only a tremendous opening track, but it was also a harbinger of things to come. The thrash metal revival was just around the corner in 2003, and in retrospect, perhaps songs like this were the seedlings. It kicks off\u2014in a literal sense\u2014with some double bass from Charlie Benante and a start/stop riff before launching into a completely unexpected thrash tirade. Catchy riffs, a big chorus, a trademark Anthrax mosh section...with all due respect to Sound of White Noise, this would've been a great sound to transition between the Belladonna and Bush eras.\n\nBut unfortunately, as with many of these \"return to form\" albums, the blistering opening track is sort of a false promise. Yes, We've Come for You All is the best album Anthrax had released in a decade, but it's also a far cry from throne-reconquering efforts like For All Kings.\n\nThings quickly settle back into that familiar 1990s Anthrax groove, but there's a difference on We've Come for You All\u2014its improved songwriting is largely able to compensate for its stylistic shortcomings. Even when it seems like things are heading for the mid-paced doldrums, there's usually a fun riff or hook to keep your finger off the skip button. In that sense, Anthrax's career renaissance really can be traced back, at least in part, to We've Come for You All.\n\nEven if all they did was stop the bleeding.\n\nThings pick back up with \"Safe Home,\" which was the album's big single. It's a beautiful mainstream metal song with a soaring, heartfelt chorus from John Bush, who sounds far more interested and engaged on this album. We've Come for You All hits a decent stride in its middle, as Charlie Benante steals the show on the percussive \"Nobody Knows Anything\" and the band storms back into a thrashing pace with \"Black Dahlia.\" This is a great example of how We've Come for You All differs from its two predecessors\u2014when this one jumps around stylistically, it does so with confidence and decent songs.\n\nThe album comes to a close with the surprising \"W.C.F.Y.A.,\" which is one of the band's most underrated songs. It's a simple groove/heavy metal song, but its chorus is an ultra-catchy fist-raiser that brings the album to a rousing close.\n\nDon't be mistaken. We've Come for You All is far from a perfect album, and its restraint often does keep it stuck in neutral. That's especially disappointing considering how much better the music is when it lets loose, but looking at this album in context, the marketing was at least partially accurate. We've Come for You All was a promising step forward for Anthrax.\n\nEven if that promise was still a few years away from being fully delivered.\n\nSongs to check out: What Doesn't Die, Safe Home, W.C.F.Y.A.\n",
        "\nAnthrax was a band in flux in 1998. Three years had passed since they released Stomp 442, which flopped with both consumers and critics, and they lost their record deal with Elektra. A previously stellar career was suddenly hitting some serious personal and professional potholes.\n\nAnd the road wasn't any smoother with Volume 8.\n\nTo be clear, Volume 8 is a better album than Stomp 442. Well, actually, that's a bit misleading\u2014Volume 8 has better songs than Stomp 442, but it's a far less cohesive album. At least Stomp 442 had an identity and consistent tone. Volume 8 feels more like a compilation than a studio release, a confused and unfocused effort that frankly reflects the state of the band at the time.\n\nThe album gets off to a much better start than its predecessor. \"Crush\" is one of the best songs of the Bush Era, and especially coming after Stomp 442, its faster pace and melodic chorus are a welcome change. A big single, \"Catharsis,\" is up next, and it's the kind of song that divides metal fans. You'll either love its simplicity and hooks or you'll vomit thrash purity all over the place, but for better or worse, it's another one of the better songs from the Bush Era.\n\nSo far, so decent, right? Well, this is where Volume 8 decides to have a schizophrenic breakdown.\n\nThe next song, \"Inside Out,\" is one of the grooviest groove songs any thrash band ever grooved in the 1990s. A vulgar display of Pantera worship from a band that really, really wanted to be Pantera at the time. But with the next three tracks, Volume 8 goes from uninspired groove metal to awkwardly out-of-context S.O.D. thrash to a goddamn country rock song, complete with a harmonica and a fake country accent from John Bush.\n\nI'm not making this up. I swear, this is actually, literally what's on the album.\n\nI have no fucking idea what they were thinking. Any momentum Volume 8 might've had with its earlier tracks is completely killed by the album's identity crisis. It seems like Anthrax wanted to shift their sound after Stomp 442's poor reception, but they couldn't decide which direction to go. It comes across as a jumbled mess of ideas, like Scott Ian wrote a bunch of different genres on a dartboard, blindfolded himself and just started throwing.\n\nThings continue in an unmemorable and generic fashion until Volume 8 comes to an unmemorable and generic close. More groove, more radio rock, more S.O.D. bursts, more confusion from a great band that shouldn't have to try so hard.\n\nThese days, Anthrax are putting out some of the best material of their career, but in 1998, these talented dudes were in a creative rut. And frankly, it was largely of their own making\u2014the perceived obligation to shift their sound in the Bush Era resulted in a stylistic aimlessness. In that way, this album's cover is perfectly fitting. If Charlie and Scott shook a Magic 8-Ball and played whatever the hell it said, they would've gotten a more cohesive record than Volume 8.\n\nSongs to check out: Crush, Catharsis, 604\n",
        "\nI'll say this. Stomp 442 definitely has a vibe. It's a fun record with a warm, appealing tone. The guitars are thick and crunchy, and as usual, John Bush sounds like a lion. You know that feeling of driving around blasting music on a summer day? That's the vibe of Stomp 442.\n\nUnfortunately, it starts raining as soon as you start the car.\n\nStomp 442 is a weird album. On their previous record, Sound of White Noise, Anthrax figured out how to successfully adjust their sound for the 1990s. Songs like \"Only\" and \"Potters Field\" tamed their driving thrash into something more accessible while also, you know, not sucking. So clearly, they figured out the recipe for good mainstream metal. And that makes the fact that they decided to do something altogether different on Stomp 442 even weirder.\n\nFor its many flaws, the thing that ultimately derails Stomp 442 is the songwriting. Say what you will about Anthrax, but they know how to write a memorable song. But there's only one memorable song on Stomp 442, and aside from a handful of cool moments, the rest of the album is dull and even grating at times.\n\nSeriously, the choruses in songs like \"Random Acts of Senseless Violence\" and \"Nothing\" will make you cringe.\n\nFor what it's worth, \"Fueled\" is the album's lone winner. It builds from a cool strummed riff that leads into a nice chugging verse and a big chorus. Charlie Benante also throws in a few double bass kicks, which drive up the energy, before the song ends with a modern take on Anthrax's classic mosh sections. It's one of John Bush's best songs with Anthrax and a cool slice of mainstream metal.\n\n\"King Size\" is also a cut above the rest. \"In a Zone\" is often pointed out as another highlight, but I've always been more fond of \"Tester.\" It has the same kind of infectious groove, but with a catchier chorus and a more dynamic structure\u2014at least by this album's standards. In fact, its lack of dynamics is the other major issue with Stomp 442, because the rest of the album bleeds together into a long blur of choked riffs, mid-tempo beats and hooks that fall flat.\n\nStill, as I mentioned, there's definitely a vibe. The album's general direction and tone at least give Stomp 442 an identity. They may have blown it with the songwriting, but it seems like Anthrax had an idea for the sound they wanted, and that at least gives the album something to lean on. Stomp 442 is best used as background music, when you can enjoy its rocking tone without focusing on the fact that it all sounds the same.\n\nI often hear Scott Ian talk about how their record label, Elektra, dropped the ball with Anthrax. Perhaps there's some truth to that, but Anthrax themselves own some of the blame, too. The band's Bush Era was off to the races with Sound of White Noise, but instead of fueling that momentum, Anthrax crashed it into a ditch with Stomp 442.\n\nSongs to check out: Fueled, King Size, Tester\n",
        "\nFor All Kings is one of Anthrax's best albums.\n\nNo qualifiers. No addendums. No bullshit. This is a classy, powerful release from a veteran band who, after a long drought, are experiencing a genuine career resurgence. For All Kings incorporates elements from their entire musical history into a perfectly balanced version of their sound, and the fact that it has some of their best songwriting only solidifies its place near the top of their catalog.\n\nSo what's so good about it? A few specific things, but also something general\u2014the record has an intangibly large feeling. It feels big. It feels grandiose. It feels supremely confident, which is especially gratifying coming from Anthrax. After years of unsure releases in which they seemed to be trying to sound like other bands, it feels like Anthrax has rediscovered themselves. It feels like they've finally embraced who they are and their place in the history of metal. And that's a good thing, because few bands do this particular style as well as Anthrax.\n\nFor All Kings begins with a fury in \"You Gotta Believe,\" a blistering thrasher in which we're treated to Scott Ian's tight riffing and Charlie Benante's driving rhythms. When these two lock in, it's thrash perfection. From there, the pace slows down a bit, but the songwriting is strong enough to maintain the momentum. The title track \"For All Kings\" is a gorgeous metal song, with escalating thrash riffs that build up to one of the biggest choruses Anthrax has ever written. \"Breathing Lightning\" comes in next as the clear \"single\" and centerpiece of the album. Often in thrash, the \"single\" just means \"the boring money-grabbing song,\" but again, the songwriting here is good enough to more than carry the load. It's a perfectly catchy and classy kind of accessible metal single.\n\nThe second half of the record is where things get more interesting musically. \"Suzerain\" features a chugging riff that feels more \"modern metal\" than the rest of the record, but things storm back into more familiar territory with \"Evil Twin.\" Anthrax's years of writing more melodic music really benefit their return to thrasher material, as they can apply those melodic sensibilities to that old thrash template. The result is songs like \"Evil Twin\" and the aforementioned \"You Gotta Believe,\" vicious thrashers that include enormous hooks. It's a beautiful thing.\n\n\"Blood Eagle Wings\" is a massive, sprawling song that explores a lot of different dynamics, and later, the album closes with a pair of gems. \"This Battle Chose Us\" features a huge chorus that's impossible to NOT sing at the top of your lungs, and \"Zero Tolerance\" closes things with some of the album's thrashiest riffs.\n\nIf you're able to sideline your nostalgia and judge it based on its merits, For All Kings easily tops records like State of Euphoria and Persistence of Time. No kidding. The songs are more memorable, the music is more ambitious, the performances are tighter and the skippable tracks that interrupted the flow of their earlier records are largely absent here. It's not quite at the level of Among the Living or Spreading the Disease, but For All Kings is shockingly good for a band this late in their career. Bravo, Anthrax, and congrats on taking back the throne.\n\nSongs to check out: You Gotta Believe, For All Kings, Evil Twin\n",
        "\nMost of us will now the story. Anthrax bombarded Jon Zazula (Megaforce Records) with demos and tapes until they finally got that album deal. Scott Ian, Jon Zazula as well as early Anthrax guitarist Greg Walls have mentioned Anthrax recording a LOT of demos in their early days. Yet only two demos are listed on Metal Archives. So I assume a lot of those demos were never intended for fans to buy but recorded only to persuade Zazula and therefor lost in history as being 'non-official'.\n\nAccording to the line-up, this demo features Greg D'Angelo (drums) and Dan Spitz (lead guitar). Seeing how lead guitarist Greg Walls left the band in the summer of 1983 and Benante joined in september 1983, a demo in that line-up would probably have been recorded around august 1983 when Spitz had only just joined. \n\nBut then again, recently the band claimed Greg D'Angelo didn't play on all the songs on this demo and some were actually recorded with Benante. Which means it was recorded in a transitional period around augustus/september/october 1983. Who played on which song is still not entirely clear. Being 'murky' about certain aspects of their past seems to be a thing for Anthrax, especially in more recent years. For whatever reason.\n\nThis is probably the final demo to persuade Zazula to sign the band and had them release the 'Soldiers of Metal' 7 inch later in november 1983.\n\nAll in all this demo is that part of history where you can clearly hear Anthrax in their phase between more traditional heavy metal and thrash metal and you can understand why the band replaced Greg D'Angelo (of later White Lion fame) with Charlie Benante if they wanted to be faster and more thrashy just like their friends in Metallica who were rehearsing in the same building at that time. 'Panic' being the most obvious song on which you can hear Anthrax going toward a more speedy direction. Also this is the best and most powerful song on the demo. \n\nIn retrospect, just like the 'actual line-up' murkiness, also a lot of discussion has started on the actual song writing credits. After years of silence Greg Walls (the lead guitarist until shortly before this demo was recorded) said in an 2016 interview it still hurts him how the band used his songs and riffs but never gave him credit. Walls said he had written several songs including 'Panic' and 'Metal Thrashing Mad' but his name was nowhere to be found in the credits on the eventual Fistful Of Metal album. \n\nNow it can be said that listening to a 'disgruntled ex employee' always paints a very emotional, biased picture. But over the years Scott Ian and Charlie Benante have become the Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons of thrash metal when it comes to dealing with (ex-)members and finance. The way they can discard people from their lives and band, how they treat ex-members and how they try to make money from just about anything, does make me suspect a lot has also happened which we, the fans, don't know much about. And where there's smoke.... \n\nFor instance: Seeing how 'Metal Thrashing Mad' (not on this demo though!) was written when Greg Walls was still in the band and Benante didn't join until months after Walls had left, it seems very dubious Benante was all of a sudden mentioned as a co-songwriter of this song on the backsleeve of the Fistful album. \n\nMost hilarious moment was when in a 'Guitar.com' interview it was said that \"Benante writes many of the group's heaviest riffs and plays lead guitar on all of the albums\". This made Dan Spitz so mad somewhere in 2015, he'll probably never, ever return to the band now. And sorry Charlie but you can't pull off 'SSC/Stand Or Fall' even if you practiced for months. From this songwriting/credits point of view it becomes even more desireable to hear that 'lot' of obscure Anthrax demos from the 1982-1983 period which seem to have been lost in time. I wonder what is written on those tapes concerning recording dates and credits. Let's hope someone, someday, finds them in Zazula's attic!\n\nWhy all this talk about songwriting credits and the 'Revolving Door Band' vibe? Well, because Anthrax' attitude regarding bandmembers, music and getting that record deal, by all means necessary, is what made them record this & other demos and bombard Zazula with them. It's that attitude which made this demo. Even getting Neil Turbin in the band, despite the fact that Scott Ian couldn't stand him at all. And knowing the whole story is important for understanding the historical value of this tape!\n\nThis demo, musically, is only interesting for Anthrax collectors as being a short part of their history. The rare song here is 'Hellfire' but it is obvious why this song is 'rare'. Because it pretty much sucks. A midpaced rock song with \"She's burning with desire. Setting me on fire\" as a chorus. Yeah...it's that bad!. Also Neil Turbin sounds a bit more melodic and less raw than he would on the eventual first album 'Fistful of Metal'\n\nSo, an important demo, historically, as this is pretty much the point where Anthrax got their record deal but apart from that, just get the Fistful album for more powerful / better produced versions of these songs.\n",
        "\nWell, it's weird to say considering this is a compilation album of various Anthrax hits, but this is the first metal album I ever listened to. And, frankly, it's not entirely metal. Between the first rap metal song ever made, \"Bring the Noise\", the groove metal/hard rock songs featuring John Bush as vocalist, and the thrash metal classics, this album is more of a conglomeration of thrash metal, groove metal, and rock, putting the rock/groove metal tracks on the first half and the thrash metal songs on the second half. I was 9 when I got this album, and let me tell you, it changed my entire life. I wouldn't be here writing reviews for metal albums if it wasn't for it. I remember it like yesterday- walking into a public library, going through cd's that they had, and finding this. The cover of a massive bug with its giant eyes and the \"mad man\" face in its pupils just drew me in. I had to get it.\n\nAnd boy, did I love it. I kept the album locked up in my cd player way past the time it needed to be returned. And, when I returned it, I immediately bought the album from a CD store- in fact, this was definitely one of my first albums I ever purchased. I still own the fuckin' thing, and jam it to this day.\n\nSo, is this album good? Well, I mean, for me, it's a fucking gold mine of tunes. Frankly, as you get older, good music is just as much about reminiscing on the time you first heard it as much as it is about whether the songs are quality compared to other material out there. For practically every song on this album, I have a distinct memory that goes with it. I can't hate any song. But putting that aside, yes, Anthrax put a number of solid tracks on here, and the band's overall talent throughout the years really shines through.\n\nStarting with the more hard rock/groove metal material, I think it's fair to say that Anthrax did a great job creating some groovy and heavy pieces of work with John Bush as the vocalist. It all sounds like a 10x better version of Pantera, without the disgusting redneck personalities and country influence. John's got a great dirty singing voice while the riffs are catchy and remain stuck in your head for hours. Charlie Benante's drumming give an incredibly vibrancy to a lot of it, making songs like \"Only\" or \"Crush\" really come to life. The remix of \"Potters Field\" is an absolute mind fuck, arguably better than the original by incorporating very intense explosion samples. And, of course, there's \"Bring The Noise\", which is probably the best rap-metal song that will ever exist. Seriously, Public Enemy with Anthrax puts the entire Nu Metal genre to fucking shame. The thrashy guitar tone of Scott Ian's guitar mixed with Chuck D's rapping is like peanut butter and jelly, and no one has ever been able to make a rap metal song better than this. \n\nThe second half features the thrash metal classics that Anthrax is best known for, everything from \"Among the Living\" to \"Madhouse\" to \"Antisocial\". Admittedly, the change up of vocals from the first to second half of the album (switching from John Bush to Joey Belladonna) used to really throw me off, because they certainly do feel like two completely different bands. However, that doesn't mean either version of Anthrax is better or worse than the other, just different. As any Anthrax fan would know, Joey brings a cleaner voice to the table, which means more of an overall \"punch\" in the sound is given by the guitars and drums. As always, Charlie brings an incredible amount of groove to the band through his drumming, but his performance really sticks out on both \"Indians\" and \"I Am the Law\u201d. The sudden slow down of tempo during \u201cIndians\u201d and the beginning two-step during \u201cI Am the Law\u201d still make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. The mix during this half of the compilation is more reminiscent of 80\u2019s thrash metal (obviously), allowing the guitar tones to breathe through a bit more than they do with their groove metal material. The drums are mixed to be a little bit more in the background, while the bass guitar is mixed with substantially less bass in the EQ.\n\nI definitely recommend anyone trying to get into Anthrax to start with this compilation. This album gives a great synopsis of where the band came from and where they went. Of course, since this release, they have gone back to their thrash roots and reunited with Joey. Nevertheless, both styles that Anthrax developed shine through really well on this release.\n",
        "\nFive years ago, Anthrax released the great Anthems EP. It included one original song from the outstanding Worship Music comeback record in its regular album version and a different version with more dominant orchestral sounds. The other six tracks were cover songs, varying from commercial hard rock to ambitious progressive rock. The release was available in seven different versions with seven different cover artworks, one for each different song included on the release. The band said that it would like to release similar records between regular studio albums in the future. \n\nThat's why Leftoverthrax is a missed occasion. Instead of eight songs, it only includes two cover tracks. Kansas' ''Carry on Wayward Son'' has been covered way too many times and Anthrax' version doesn't add anything new to the original song. The White Stripes' ''Black Math'' is a much more original choice and underlines Anthrax' many different inspirations. This record was released as a limited vinyl version and a lame digital release only which is a shame since the funny cover artwork inspired by Kansas' Leftoverture would make for a cool collector's item.\n\nThe two songs on this release aren't bad but this release feels rushed and must be considered a missed occasion to come around with an interesting extended play. Leftoverthrax is at least an honest title for such a release that might only be interesting to the most faithful collectors and fans of the sympathetic American East Coast thrash metal quintet.\n",
        "\nAnthrax has been on an impressive streak since singer Joey Belladonna rejoined the band eight years ago. The band didn't only release two incredible comeback records with Worship Music and For All Kings but also delivered incredibly energetic live shows. The aptly titled Chile on Hell might be one of the very best live records ever released. Having attended two concerts of the band over the past few years, I can only confirm the band's incredible chemistry and will always remember these shows as some of the best I have ever attended. Kings Among Scotland doesn't disappoint in that regard either. The band is in great form. The drums sound dynamic, heavy and versatile. The bass guitar is the band sound's solid backbone. The guitar work is incredible, regarding both the fast thrash metal riffs and the heartfelt melodic passages. Joey Belladonna sings as if he were thirty years younger than he actually is and underlines his status as the genre's best vocalist. The crowd is great as well, sings and cheers along loudly to tracks like the hard rocking ''Madhouse'' and the atmospheric epic ''Be All, End All''. The production is crisp, direct and organic and makes you feel as if you were rocking Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow with the five lads from the American East Coast.\n\nObviously, one might debate whether it's necessary to purchase a live record less than four years after the legendary Chile On Hell. The track lists have quite a few similarities. Chile on Hell featured six songs from Among the Living, Kings Among Scotland includes the entire record consisting of nine songs. Classics like ''Madhouse'', ''Antisocial'' and ''Medusa'' are included on both releases. At least, the new release includes three great renditions taken from Anthrax's last high-quality studio record For All Kings with the powerful ''Evil Twin'', the epic ''Blood Eagle Wins'' and the wonderfully melodic power ballad ''Breathing Lightning''. Still, the track lists of the two releases are too similar in my opinion. If you are a casual fan, you could just purchase the slightly better Chile On Hell because of its incredible crowd. Fans of Anthrax's records with Joey Belladonna will certainly purchase both records and enjoy the hell out of both.\n\nKings Among Scotland simply underlines Anthrax's status as one of the best live bands in the world and offers a generous eighteen tracks with a running time just above two hours. The video version of this release additionally features a few video clips, behind-the-scenes footage and gear rundown with each band member. The only downside is that there seems to be no release that combines the two CD version and the live DVD. Since I purchased the video version of Chile on Hell three and a half years ago, I will go for the double-disc release this time around. I can't wait to blast this excellent release in my car this summer.\n",
        "\nAny self-respecting thrasher has certainly heard of Anthrax. We all heard the story, two classmates form a band named after a disease they read about in a textbook in their biology class. Neil Turbin, Scott Ian, Dan Lilker, Charlie Benante and Dan Spitz was the original Anthrax, and after the \"Soldiers Of Metal\" single was recorded, Jon Zazula signed the band. \"Fistful Of Metal\" was the 3rd Big Four debut to come out, after Metallica's \"Kill Em All\" and Slayer's \"Show No Mercy\". The record had some killer tracks here and there, but ultimately fell flat due to hollow production. This is a classic however, and would be the only Anthrax album to feature Lilker and Turbin before both got fired. \n\nNow before I mention the songs, I would just like to go on record by saying the production is extremely dry and hollow, and lacks any real punch. There is a reverb that I don't like about this, they could of done better. Anyways, the record begins with \"Deathrider\", which has some good riffs. To be honest, I'm not as crazy about Scott Ian as many thrashers seem to be. He is certainly a great rhythm guitarist, but he never impressed me as much as Hetfield, Mustaine or Hanneman. The vocals of Neil Turbin are pretty decent, but he clearly doesn't match the greatness of Joey Belladonna that would follow on the next record \"Spreading The Disease\". Dan Lilker is an incredible bassist, he is the standout performer here. I prefer his work with Nuclear Assault however, I just don't think he belonged in Anthrax despite the fact he pretty much founded the band along with Ian. Dan Spitz's solos are damn good, they are probably the best solos he has done along with the solos on \"Spreading The Disease\" and \"Among The Living\". Charlie Benante as we all know is one of the greatest thrash drummers on the planet, but I feel like his talents aren't showcased here as much as his later work. \n\n\"Metal Thrashing Mad\" is basically the song that helped coin the term \"thrash\", after Kerrang! referred to the song as \"thrash metal\". This song shows off the impressive vocal range of Turbin, this is undoubtedly his best performance. The next track bemused me however. No disrespect to Mr. Alice Cooper, the guy is certainly talented, but which person at Megaforce Records thought it was a good idea to add a cover of \"I'm Eighteen\"? They must have been smoking something, because this is totally out of place and doesn't fit well on here at all. Hell, even Scott Ian himself refused to take part in the recording of the cover from what I read. This deducts points off the overall score of this review. \"Panic\" is easily the highlight, the awesome drum work from Benante is remarkable, and the main guitar riff is a classic. Don't forget that guitar solo! This one is a must listen. Most of the rest of the record however is pretty disposable unfortunately, there are some filler tracks which put me to sleep on occasion. This overall drains the life out of the listener, where did the exciting, vibrant thrashing madness go? Hmmm....\n\nWell my question was answered with the redeeming last 2 tracks, \"Across The River\" and \"Howling Furies\". \"Across The River\" is a neat little instrumental which contains some sick shredding and \"Howling Furies\" brings some much needed life back into the whole listening experience. I love the guitar harmony near the middle of this track, it sounds metal as fuck! This is how you redeem yourself and save your record from falling completely flat!\n\n\"Fistful Of Metal\" is definitely essential listening for any thrash fan, I mean come on, it's fucking Anthrax! However, I rarely find myself listening to this record, because there are a lot better debut thrash records out there. I have to admit that Turbin was an awesome vocalist on this album, but I feel like he wouldn't of fit on later Anthrax albums. So my overall verdict? Buy this and add it to your collection. Listen to it once or twice, then place it on the shelf to collect dust. I recommend this for fans of Judas Priest, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Saxon, Motorhead and Diamond Head.\n\nHighlights: \"Metal Thrashing Mad\", \"Panic\", \"Across The River\" and \"Howling Furies\n",
        "\nThis little gem hasn't been touched since 2011 here on the archives, and much to my surprise, a large number of people hate it?! What the actual hell? I'm usually less than surprised when the typical user likes to hate on anything glam or fun related, but this? To those unfamiliar, Armed And Dangerous is a fun little EP that came shortly before Spreading The Disease. To summarize, it's basically that song, an unreleased track, a Sex Pistols cover, and two live cuts from Fistful Of Metal, but with Joey on vocals. Yeah, why in God's name would anyone want to own this piece of shit, right?\n\nThe only variation of the title track that differentiates it from the song on the sophomore album is that it has a longer fade in for the intro; ya know, that acoustic little piece that precedes the beef of the track? Nothing to get too excited about, but regardless of which release you're listening from, it's still a killer track. However, the other song on this side \"Raise Hell\" is a gem that you can't get on the full lengths, and it pretty much sticks to the early Belladonna era that most are familiar with. Definitely a quick but solid track.\n\nEntering side B is where it gets truly interesting. The first song is a cover of \"God Save The Queen\" by The Sex Pistols. Never mind the fact that I'm a huge Sex Pistols fan getting way too excited upon discovering this, I would have loved it even if I weren't. This is a killer rendition of a punk classic that gives a new level of energy, replacing the attitude that Johnny Rotten and co. laid down eight years prior. Those riffs could not be more defining of thrash, and are a great way to showcase the influence that punk had on the genre as a whole (as if everyone didn't already know that anyway). Lastly, we get \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" and \"Panic\" from the debut album, performed with Joey. It's always neat to find stuff like this, as it adds a different twists to existing songs by the band itself. Nothing too special, but there certainly isn't anything to complain about. \n\nSo uh, yeah, why a large number of people shit all over this, I'll never come close to knowing. It certainly isn't \"pointless\", it certainly isn't a waste of time (it's nineteen minutes long for fucks sake, get over yourselves), and it's just a fun, honest little collection of Anthrax tunes from a time when they weren't known as the American thrash legends we would come to know and love. I'm unsure of how hard this is to come across, as I bought the LP for cheap off a highschool friend, but if you come across it, it's certainly worth picking up.\n",
        "\nFor All Kings is the second new studio album from Anthrax since re-uniting with singer Joey Belladonna. The last album, Worship Music, was written with a different vocalist in mind and Belladonna had to come in and work around the songs that weren't written for his voice and style. However, he did a great job and the album was very good so it was with much anticipation we all waited for For All Kings. This was the album written with and for Belladonna and come a long five years after Worship Music. The question is, can this album surpass Worship Music, or for that matter can it live up to their legendary past catalog? For the most part For All Kings follows in the footsteps of Worship Music. The album is heavy but melodic and built around Charlie Benante and Scott Ian\u2019s melodic and thick riffing driven by Benante\u2019s inspiring drumming. After a quick intro, You Gotta Believe rips through the speakers with a classic sounding Anthrax riff that could have been taken right from their classic 80's catalog. The song is fast and furious, which is not the norm for the album. For the most part the band avoids the speed of thrash metal and keeps things more mid-paced. However, there are exceptions such as Evil Twin and the closing song Zero Tolerance where Anthrax revisits the speed and aggression that made them one of the Big 4 back in the early 80's. These three tracks are three of my favorites on the album and should please any longtime Anthrax fan. \n\nWith above average songs like Breathing Lightning the band shows off their more accessible side, not unlike the hooky The Devil You Know on Worship Music. Likewise Monster At The End and Suzerain contain solid hooks and remind me of the John Bush-era of the band. Perhaps one of the best tracks on the album is buried at the end of the album. The Battle Chose Us is a driving song with a big groove and monstrous, head-banging vibe and memorable chorus. However, what really makes the song one of the best is the last half of the song which is a smattering of the glorious thrash metal of the past with Benante\u2019s controlled chaotic drumming driving the song without forsaking the melody. Vocalist Joey Belladonna is back and his clean mid-range vocals fit the material ever so perfectly. He's not forcing out the high notes as he once did, but his voice is strong and aggressive. New lead guitarist Jon Donais of Shadows Fall fame replaces longtime guitarist Rob Caggiano. His leads throughout the record blend seamlessly with the songs. \n\nOverall Anthrax captures the same blend of melodic heavy metal and thrash metal leanings that were present on Worship Music. No, nothing they do now will be able to overtake the raw, youthful energy of their early catalog or even Worship Music for that matter. The nostalgia most fans hold alone would never allow it. However, they deliver a diverse selection of songs that is easily one of the best in years.\n",
        "\n'Persistence of Time' was released is August 1990, two years after its predecessor 'State of Euphoria'. Entering the new decade, Anthrax surprised many of their fans and released their heaviest and darkest effort to date. Now where had a lot of humouristic traits of the band's music gone, many were asking. Well, people get older, and they learn more about this world. The band had got deeper into business and there was always tomorrow to think about. Time ticking away, tic-toc-tic-toc... So it was goodbye to sappy bermuda shorts, comic book shirts and Beavis & Butt-Head antics (well, that \"Married With Children\" scene did happen, though). Just look at that fine cover art...\n\nOkay, 'Persistence of Time' isn't most aggressive thrash metal (or generally, metal music) out there, but in 1990 this sounded HEAVY. And it still does. The lower end might not be of nowadays' standards, but still this is loud! Compact disc was a rather new thing back then, and vinyl always sounded heftier. The guitars are ripping, to say the least, the bass is pounding, and the drums are both ringing and devastating. The vocals are lightweight compared to everything else, but they fit in perfectly. However, the mix sounds very clear, finely bringing forth everything between trebly and bassy levels. What a fantastic production by the band with Mark Dodson (who also produced Suicidal Tendencies, Metal Church, Judas Priest and U.D.O. among others)!\n\nThe production alone does not an album make. What we need are good songs! Music-wise, this album is one of the best sets of the songs from Anthrax. Anyway, by putting four longest songs at the beginning of the album (from 6 and a half minutes to over seven minutes in length) the band took a brave step. While maintaining sharp and thrashy sound, it's also more heavier and more oppressive. The tempos are more middle ground this time around. However, this way the band had more space to add more meat on the bones, from tiny details to major song-smithing. Surely there are some rather slow and simple, in Anthrax's terms, parts. This isn't pure thrash metal like the previous two albums, but more varying like 1985's 'Spreading the Disease' is. This is Anthrax putting in some hard-hitting heavy metal again, in their own, unique way.\n\nThe rhythm guitarist Scott Ian does have fast, precise and heavy hand and has created his own style, but he's not overtly technically skilled otherwise. In a way, he reminds me of James Hetfield and Max Cavalera with his style: A bloody ace rhythm guitarist who does nail his bit without fucking around! The drummer Charlie Benante is a real powerhouse yet very much a detail-squeezer; very much with a unique style. These two fellas are the masterminds behind the band and the music, even though the songwriting credits go to the whole band. This is why Anthrax sound so distinct. Add to that formula the adept guitarist Dan Spitz, who is fast and clockwork-sharp, and adds melodiousness into this album that isn't particularly melodic guitar-wise.\n\nThis takes us to Joey Belladonna, whose vocals are clean, light and melodic compared to other elements. He wields his part surprisigly well, when thinking about general murkiness. He was able to incorporate some angst, vehemence and spite (lyrics include topics about holocaust, racism, rough childhood and greedy leaders). His voice isn't overlapped like on newer albums from the band, but on a few occasions; he's backed by the band. Generally, I feel that some of the vocal lines could have been more massive, more epic, because now it feels a bit too simple. On 'Got the Time' he sounds very similar as the next Anthrax vocalist John Bush (of Armored Saint fame). Last but not least comes the bass player extraordinaire, Frank Bello with his clanking finger-played. He's fucking everywhere, even though isn't soloing but on that cover song. All-important, hard-workng piece of machinery. I play both drums and bass, and Charlie and Frank are some of the best artists, not just mere players, with their instruments I've ever heard. It's not merely about backing the guitars.\n\nSo, this is still Anthrax from two previous albums, but heavier, darker and generally a bit slower. 'Keep It in the Family' starts as the slowest Anthrax stomper up to date, but even it picks up pace at some point. These longer song kind of build up a momentum, being like advancing tanks. Everything is in motion all the time.. Then again, 'Gridlock' begins basically with grinding. The band was on their way towards groove metal, and it can be heard here and there during these 60 minutes. Well, this packs more groove than actual groove metal albums often do, to tell the truth! There are no funny melodies or vibes, and melodiousness is at times missing ('Gridlock' being the clearest example, and also the only throw-away track); this also happens with Joey's vocals, as he was instructed to sound more angry or whatever, hence giving us less melodies. 'Belly of the Beast' contains some early Iron Maiden style riffing. Music-wise, 'Discharge' is the most related to earlier Anthrax. The Joe Jackson cover 'Got the Time... The band really made it their own, even though it's way punky than anything else here. The outcome, as a whole album, is a very organic-sounding thing packed with extremely explosive energy.\n\nGrunge and overtly polished thrash, or more like \"thrash\" metal, hadn't as yet hit the music world as hard as they would later. 'Persistence of Time' is a fine artifact of its turbulent time before the collapse that many a band, even Anthrax, fell victim to. This is thrash with seriousness, kind of Anthrax's '..And Justice for All', 'Twisted into Form' or 'Oppressing the Masses'. This would be one of my \"desert island\" albums!\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nThe history of thrash metal is arguably one of the most blatant paradoxes within the broader metal world. While many would assert that the sub-genre hit its apex in the mid-80s, with a highly varied spectrum of expressions ranging from mainline melodic fair of Megadeth's Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? and the punk-infused Game Over courtesy of Nuclear Assault, to the extreme darkness and fury of Slayer's Reign In Blood and Dark Angel's Darkness Descends making 1986 the year of thrash for many, there is an alternative view that is equally plausible that involves putting the climax of the style near the end of its original run in the early 90s. Though the progression in style that thrash underwent at this time was predicted to an extent by Metallica's Master Of Puppets in 1986, it wasn't until the follow up effort ...And Justice For All that things truly started to change, and barring the inherent flaws in said records due to internal politics and Lars Urlich's douche-baggery, provided an archetype that would be followed to masterful effect by several prominent players.\n\nThough usually overshadowed by the catchy and speedy showmanship of Among The Living, the fifth and final classic Anthrax album Persistence Of Time marks the point where the SRB rockets have been dropped and the real space travel begins. Drawing upon the same gradualism and longer songwriting that typified Heathen's Victims Of Deception, Megadeth's Rust In Peace and Forbidden's Twisted Into Form, they provided a New York answer to the Bay Area question, all the while maintaining their generally punk-infused, gang-chorus happy format. It doesn't go to the point of becoming an entirely different band playing in a style that was not part of them to begin with, but expands upon and exaggerates the technical prowess and infectious hooks that have arguably made Anthrax the most accessible member of the Big 4. But even more so than this album's lack of inhibition in showcasing the talents of all persons involved, it is an album that is highly measured and effective in its approach, allowing each transition to flow smoothly and for each idea to be given its proper emphasis.\n\nAs a band, Anthrax has never been wholly averse to writing longer songs, but they've generally compensated for a fairly repetitive approach to progression with either an exaggerated level of speed or a comical angle to the lyrics and vocal presentation to provide a needed degree of distraction. However, the elongated epics that round out the bulk of the first half of this album opt not so much to distract or accent good ideas with additional toppings, but rather to present a greater multiplicity of ideas and progressing from a chugging groove or atmospheric starting point to a faster destination. Indeed, the seven minute long mid-paced crusher \"Keep It In The Family\" is more in line with the sort of ground pounding heaviness that Metallica rolled out on \"The Frayed Ends Of Sanity\" and \"The Shortest Straw\", and apart from Joey Belladonna's lighter and less gritty vocal approach could pass for a Metallica song. The same story holds true for the faster-paced cruisers \"Blood\" and \"Time\", though Scott Ian's riff work gets quite busy and even presents a less redundant version of Metallica's 1988 handiwork.\n\nWhile this isn't an album that lives by speed alone, it is important to note that Anthrax by no means forgot how to cook or pretended that they did in the name of fitting in with the crowd here. This becomes immediately apparent with the blurring riff work and rapid fire drumming heard on \"Gridlock\" and this opus' highly frenetic closer \"Discharge\", both of which would have rivaled the most intense moments heard on Among The Living while also benefiting from a heavier and more polished production. Likewise, the gag-based sense of comedy makes a brief appearance with the Joe Jackson cover \"Got The Time\", which is presented in its original punk rock format, save a bit faster and with a heavier guitar tone, but nevertheless sticks out like a sore thumb next to the longer and far more complex original work. Truth be told, Dan Spitz's guitar soloing proves to be the most unchanging element in this band's first decade of existence, and his generally reserved and expressive playing sees the usual share of spotlight as any previous LP, whereas Scott Ian's riff work invariably steals the entire show.\n\nIn a sense, this is Anthrax's finest hour as a thrash metal band, namely if one discounts the first two albums as being more of a speed metal affair despite being a bit more memorable and captivating song for song. One might even call Persistence Of Time the ultimate middle of the road thrash metal album where heaviness is emphasized and speed is used a bit more sparingly. It's not quite as technically amazing as Rust In Peace, nor does it succeed in cycling through as many different changes and ideas as Time Does Not Heal or Twisted Into Form, but it does something a bit more inviting for those looking for something closer to a straight up thrashing experience, namely taking the road that ...And Justice For All would have there been any noticeable degree of bass presence in the mix. It's an undeniable swansong from a band that would probably suffer the worst downturn in musical direction thanks to the ascendancy of grunge a few years later, and an essential offering for any fan of thrash metal.\n",
        "\nRe-recording your greatest hits is rarely a good idea. The only positive exception I could think of is Aria's incredibly dynamic Live in Studio album that revamps the group's heavy metal classics in an energizing fashion. In the case of The Greater of Two Evils, the final result is a mixed bag.\n\nOn the positive side, the record has a vivid live atmosphere and especially the instrumentation sounds crunchier than on the band's first five records. The band sounds hungry and clearly performs with passion. John Bush's powerful and throaty vocals sound slightly better than what Neil Turpin had to offer on Anthrax's debut release. Therefore, the vivid reinterpretations of ''Deathrider'', ''Metal Thrashing Mad'', ''Panic'' and ''Anthrax'' on some editions can be considered highlights of this release.\n\nOn the negative side, fans have become comfortable with the original versions. The overall sound of the reinterpretations is a little bit darker and the guitar solos aren't as enthusiastic, fast and high-pitched as back in the band's early years. Obviously, this instrumentation suits John Bush's vocals very well. It's always recommendable to adapt the sound of a band to its vocalist. If you don't do that, you will witness a result similar to the stressful live concerts with Blaze Bayley when he was in Iron Maiden. It's not necessarily a bad thing that Anthrax tries to give its new songs a slightly new identity. However, John Bush's vocals aren't as energizing, free-spirited and juvenile as Joey Belladonna's unique vocal skills back then. The revamped versions of the songs from Joey Belladonna's first stint with the band simply can't mess with the original versions.\n\nI've never understood why some fans defend John Bush and even consider him Anthrax's best vocalist. In my opinion, those people must be tone deaf because Joey Belladonna's vocals are an essential part of Anthrax's vivid spirit and indentity. I also can't find many positive things to say about the failed grunge album Sound of White Noise, the uninspired groove metal releases Stomp 442 and Volume 8 - The Threat Is Real and finally the tiresome alternative metal record We've Come for You All. To be honest with you, I wouldn't miss any of those four records if they had never been released. Anthrax should just have gone on hiatus after Joey Belladonna left in my humble opinion and focus on several of its side projects such as Stormtroopers of Death.\n\nListening to The Greater of Two Evils is nowhere near as exciting as listening to any of Anthrax's first five albums. Even the weakest of the bunch, namely Fistful of Metal, with all its obvious flaws was more convincing than The Greater of Two Evils because of its juvenile pioneer spirit. It would have been acceptable to release another live album where John Bush performs old and new songs of the band but the release of The Greater of Two Evils is completely pointless in my opinion. It's not a bad record because the song material still remains great and John Bush isn't a bad singer technically speaking but this release is missing the spirit from the band's early years that made Anthrax stand out among the gros of thrash metal bands. The Greater of Two Evils is only for collectors and the surprisingly elevated number of John Bush fanboys that I won't ever understand.\n",
        "\nWith Anthrax being my favourite act of the Big Four, I have to admit I was a bit apprehended about the album reviewed here. The wave of adjustment efforts which The Black Album unleashed in 1991 was a hit-and-miss affair with some supposed highs (Kreator, Flotsam & Jetsam, Xentrix) and some undisputable lows (Overkill, Exodus, Testament,) all released in 1992, seeing the old timers trying to adapt to the new vogues any which they seemed fit, sacrificing a lot of their previous swagger and quite a bit of their principles and values. Anthrax were wise to wait a bit, and see how this whole aggro/groovy/post-thrashy carnival would turn out; besides, they also had to deal with the blow that was Joey Belladonna\u2019s departure, and although Armored Saint\u2019s John Bush seemed like an able replacement, no one knew how the audience would react to the loss of such an emblematic figure\u2026\n\nwell, the audience reacted quite positively, to be honest, and this opus is one of the very few that managed to ensure another resounding, both commercial and critical, success for its creators although the numbers achieved by the Metallica black saga remained a very wishful thinking. I\u2019m sure the Anthrax team never wasted precious time in such illusions to begin with, and this is the reason why they managed one more fairly decent showing before sinking\u2026\n\nsinking is not on the list here, though, and \u201cPotters Field\u201d is a squashing steam-roller, after overcoming the static white noise at the beginning, which even holds a few surprises for the headbangers with impetuous speedy escapades. Bush acquits himself in a splendid way holding his melodic, not very attached clean timbre unerringly throughout, taking the lead on the more laid-back material (\u201cOnly\u201d, \u201cRoom for One More\u201d), and not only because of the memorable choruses on those. The post-thrashy fiesta is in full swing here, but the guys still manage to pull it off in their own way like on the more engaging, more versatile progressiver \u201cPackaged Rebellion\u201d which would make the B-side of \u201cPersistence of Time\u201d any time, and a template the band still follow as evident from a couple of tracks after Belladonna\u2019s return. Pleasant groovy fillers are mandatory if a band wanted to gain the audience\u2019s attention during those times, and \u201cHy Pro Glo\u201d can pass for one with its friendly bouncy rhythm and the relatively more relaxed attitude although more than just a few will jump around on the jarring hectic riffage. \n\n\u201cInvisible\u201d epitomizes the groove whole-heartedly stretching it to over 6-min without doing much with it except leadening the environment to doomy proportions. \u201c1000 Points of Hate\u201d could be considered a revelation with its livelier thrashy guitars, dramatic accumulations and more dynamic leaps and bounds, arguably the highlight here. \u201cBlack Lodge\u201d is a perfectly acceptable ballad with a great chorus and a few edgier moments the latter increased exponentially for \u201cC11 H17\u2026\u201d where more aggressive proto-thrashing \u201cfights\u201d with abrasive groovy additives. The thrashing eventually lives to see its day in the form of \u201cBurst\u201d, a very appropriately-titled piece, a momentary dash of old school speed/thrash, the needed doze of vitality before the sombre clumsy groover that is \u201cThis is Not an Exit\u201d. Well, it\u2019s an exit, actually, but not the most dignified one\u2026\n\nthe American scene invented the groove, and it subjected the majority of its practitioners to it, the latter more or less willingly following down this new, but hardly more exciting path. Although Megadeth, and later Slayer, showed their middle finger to it, keeping it raised for another couple of years, the others surrendered to the \u201cadapt or die\u201d setting largely in order to mimic Metallica\u2019s success. Again, the album reviewed here came the closest to it, and kept the Anthrax name unstained\u2026 \n\nwell, not for long. I\u2019ve listened to \u201cStomp 442\u201d and \u201cLoad\u201d back to back several times, and haven\u2019t been able to figure why the former sounds so much worse than the latter; I by no means like \u201cLoad\u201d; in fact, I consider it the lowest point in Metallica\u2019s career, way lower than \u201cSt. Anger\u201d even\u2026 it\u2019s just that this \u201cstomp\u201d is so awful by any conceivable criterion that it can\u2019t help but easily find its rightful pace beside the biggest flops in metal history like Helloween\u2019s \u201cChameleon\u201d, Megadeth\u2019s \u201cRisk\u201d, Celtic Frost\u2019s \u201cCold Lake\u201d, Destruction\u2019s mid-90\u2019s period, and Kreator\u2019s \u201cEndorama\u201d. I naturally lost interest in any subsequent effort the band made, and only started paying attention to the guys\u2019 endeavours after Belladonna rejoined the team. The music on the last two has come close to worshipping on the best moments, but the sound of this white noise made in the distant 1993 still makes the rounds more convincingly, if only as a capable adaptation stint.\n",
        "\nSo, let's just get this out of the way now. nu metal is an abomination known to man. With the exception of Korn (EARLY KORN MIND YOU), Deftones, Early Linkin Park, Soulfly, and the occasional spin of The Burning Red by Machine Head, nu metal was a shit-stain best left behind in the late 90's and early 2000's. Whiny vocals, laughable lyrics that would make try hard grunge bands cringe, and simplistic structures and song arrangements, it was everything that us metal-heads hated, except this was marketed as the future of metal by TRL and record companies. I'd much rather listen to metal-core and death-core, than to EVER have to listen to a nu metal album again. (end of rant) \n\nWith that said, Anthrax basically laid the blueprint for the genre in 1987 when they decided to throw in their own take on the comedic rap formula that the Beastie Boys helped pioneer, with the release of their single I'm The Man. At the time, the idea of rap and metal merging together seemed impossible, and probably wasn't even thought of. Well, I'm proud to say that Anthrax created a song that's very comedic and self aware of this ridiculous idea, and decided to run with it. \n\nI gotta hand it to the boys, the first time I heard this song, I laughed my ass off. The lyrics on this song are just pure gold that add to the overall stupidity (a good kind of stupidity mind you) and make the song even more enjoyable than it already was. Seriously the first time I heard the lyrics, \"They say rap and metal can never mix,well all of them can suck a sexual organ located in the lower abdominal area! No man, it's dick!\" I nearly fell out of my seat in 6th period history class. The music is very well written too, I really enjoy the beat provided by Joey Belladonna on this song (he's pretty good), and the riff-age provided by Dan Spitz and Scott Ian. It meshes very well with the song, providing a very hard edge to an otherwise goofy song. Also, major respect to the hilarity that Frank Bello provides me. Scott and Charlie do very well with they're parts too, but holy shit is Frank hysterical. His corrections to Scott's mistakes are what make this track to me, not to say that Scott and Charlie don't do a fine job, they do, it's just that Frank is defiantly the final piece to this song, and without his contributions, the song wouldn't feel as complete, and it might've even been a little awkward sounding to be honest. \n\nAs for the rest of the tracks on this EP, they're mostly okay. The cover of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is okay, but it could've benefited from just a little more speed. Because as it stands, it's more or less a by the numbers cover, with the only difference being that Joey is singing this instead of Ozzy. Also, what the hell happened to the crazy little tribal intro found on the original version of the song boys? The live version of I'm The Man is ass, don't even bother with it. It's a fucking mess to put it lightly. It's a shame that the song doesn't really translate all that well live, because it could've been a concert staple if done right. The live version of Caught In A Mosh is very energetic for sure, and has a little more of a faster tempo than the studio version, which is always a good thing in my books, and I've never listened to the live version of I'm The Law because eh? \n\nOther than a few duds found within the extra tracks, this little EP is definitely worth listening to for sure. I wouldn't buy it per say, but I would recommend streaming it off of Spotify because it's a good EP. I just wish that nu metal was much better than it was. Seriously guys, Anthrax and Faith No More both showed you how to do it right, so what went wrong? I guess one will never know.\n",
        "\nIf you read some of my other reviews, you\u2019ll see that I can be a very, very vicious critic. But I\u2019m probably not going to be that vicious here. I love this album. And now, after an extended hiatus, I\u2019m back to make fun of albums that I both love and hate. \n\nState of Euphoria is an underrated album. Not just for Anthrax, but probably the most underrated album of the Big Four\u2019s entire catalog. Yes, it\u2019s not quite as good as the \u2018Thrax albums it\u2019s sandwiched between, but outside of \u201cAntisocial\u201d, nothing on SOE generally gets much love or respect, which is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad thing. This album boasts some of Anthrax\u2019s best riffs, catchiest hooks, and showcases Joey Belladonna\u2019s vocals at, arguably, their very best. SOE isn\u2019t riddled with masterpieces like the previous couple Anthrax records, but the good songs on here are extremely good.\n\nThe album opens with the stompy-as-fuck \u201cBe All, End All,\u201d which is a perfect microcosm of this album. Just listen to that riff (but ignore the weirdly out-of-place cello intro). Listen to that melodic crunchiness. Terrific. \u201cAntisocial\u201d is a great cover of what was originally a pretty softcore song, and makes us all remember what punky East Coast thrash is all about. The riff for \u201cMisery Loves Company\u201d is OK, but the song is really all about the vocals. The melodies are the most memorable on the whole album. Listen to that chorus! Total earworm. \u201cFinale\u201d is just that: all the best riffs Anthrax had on this album are right there in all their majestic load-blowing glory. \n\nThere are a few square wheels here as well, but nothing deal breaking. \u201cOut of Sight, Out of Mind\u201d might be the most by-the-numbers Anthrax song they ever wrote. It feels forced and generic and just a whole big pile of other \u201cblah\u201d words. \u201cNow It\u2019s Dark\u201d is a pretty mediocre song, but the lyrics were inspired by Blue Velvet, which is one of my favorite (and one of my wife\u2019s least favorite) movies. So, SOE earned an extra point or two out of me just for that. \n\nAnthrax\u2019s classic albums haven\u2019t really been known for having the best production values, but SOE manages to finally hit that sweet spot, making it the overall best-sounding classic \u2018Thrax album. \n\nI was watching Caddyshack when I wrote this review and this album gets no respect. No respect at all, I tell ya! If you don\u2019t think this album is underrated and secretly great, you\u2019re entitled to your opinion, but fuck you because you\u2019re wrong.\n",
        "\nFollowing the years of tribulations together, New York thrash legends Anthrax have soldiered on despite the constant line-up shuffling and uncertainty to come back recharged, refocused and more intent on providing the type of thrashing material from their heyday. Coming back together with Megaforce Records once again, the groups\u2019 eleventh full-length of original material and first with new guitarist Jonathan Donais was originally released February 26, 2016 after a five-year gap between releases.\n\nBeing around for as long as they have, this here is pretty similar to what\u2019s been apart of their sound for the majority of their career which focuses on the tight, melodic twin guitar-based thrashing that\u2019s featured here. The riffing is highly melodic and makes for quite a rousing series of high-energy riffing that\u2019s quite heavy while also bringing along plenty of melodic harmonies in the vocals as well as the strong leads throughout here create a strong sense of surging melody that compliments the varied heavier riffing throughout here. That comes from a selection of pieces that range from hard rock-inspired numbers mixed with some mid-tempo groove to their traditional stomp-style thrashing that raises the energy considerably and even drops the energy level down into a more slower-paced crawl with the addition of ballad-esque numbers that occur here which are also quite evenly mixed into the album as a whole. This is quite a dramatic variety that delivers on a dynamic level quite readily with this one having such a varied yet still contained feel and tone that carries throughout the album as a proper whole which makes for a highly-appealing time here that offers up enough sections from each part of their career that it readily allows for anyone to get into it. The only real breaking point is the ballad which some would claim might not really belong on the album but for the most part it\u2019s still a great listen on the whole.\n\nWith plenty of variety to get any fan of any point of their career covered which makes this one of their brightest and most enjoyable releases in their vast catalog and ranks as one of the better releases of the year which makes this an easy choice for fans of the band\u2019s more recent output or the group in general as well as the old-school thrash scene overall.\n",
        "\n'Bordello of Blood' was a song written for Tales from the Crypt's soundtrack. A lot of these film/show-music crossovers from the time were never all that good to begin with, at least when they don't make a studio album from said artist and are specifically made for a soundtrack. They tend towards being overly simplistic and bland songs where the only thing of note comes in the form of aesthetic elements like vague references to the film/show in the lyrics or a somewhat thematic or otherwise expensive music video ('I Disappear' being the archetype) and this is no exception. This should come as no surprise to anyone; Anthrax's work during John Bush's stint with the band was terrible. The song isn't dark in the way the show was, instead it listens like an outtake from Anthrax's most recent album at the time, Stomp 442.\n\nThat album's style of slightly fuzzy, hard rocking groove metal riffs and chugging is used here, though the song leans a little more on the alternative rock side of things with the guitarwork being more melodic and less trying-to-be-aggressive than a lot of material on there; it's more 'Nothing' than 'Fueled'. Nevertheless just like Stomp everything played by the guitarists is tedious and boring 'in one ear, out the other' material that listens like watered down, bad Pantera cast-off material. There is at least a (very) brief lead section at the end; it's a drop of water to a weary traveller in the desert but it's something to break the song up; which is needed as the riffs are repeated throughout the song. As they were never interesting enough to even make the cut of a decent song they wear out their welcome as soon as they are played, so the song gets tiresome very quickly. \n\nThe same can be said of the hook, which consists of the annoying repetition of samey sounding lines like 'On my own', 'I gotta go, I gotta go home' and 'I'm home'; the only reason the song is really memorable is how annoyingly basic the hook is. John Bush's vocals are as bad as they've always been at this point; he sings like a bargain basement grunge/post-grunge singer (a really bad Scott Weiland, say) with some rasp and a lot of semi-tuneful hollering that sounds off and bad. There are no real emotive qualities to his voice so he doesn't really shoot for anything - despite what the lyrics convey there's no sense of fear or dread in his voice (and even if there was it's not like the instruments would match that anyway) and whatever attempt at aggression the band are going for, he still fails at since his voice isn't at all aggressive. The entire song is so bland; it sounds like a piece of filler that conveys and achieves nothing beyond making noise.\n\nThat's 'Bordello of Blood' everyone; another in a long line of bad heavy rock songs, courtesy of Anthrax with John Bush at the helm. What a surprise.\n",
        "\nJoey Belladonna's return and the subsequent release of Worship Music in 2011 put Anthrax in a pretty good place, but it seems like they didn't keep a high momentum going for long. Releasing the Anthems cover EP and switching lead guitarists may have spiced things up but they didn't exactly strike while the iron was hot. Fortunately For All Kings comes through as a solid addition to the band's discography, even if it took its sweet time getting here.\n\nIn the grand tradition of The Last In Line and Defenders Of The Faith, For All Kings feels like an extension of Worship Music and features many of the same elements. The style still compromises the melodic thrash of the classic era with the grunge metal outlook of the band's stint with John Bush. The production also leans in favor of the rather chunky guitar tone but it is Belladonna's persisting vocal talents that continue to lead the charge. They even kept a couple orchestral interludes around though they may actually be more properly composed this time.\n\nSpeaking of which, the vocal hooks in particular keep this album from feeling like a tired retread. While songs like \"The Devil You Know\" and \"The Giant\" had plenty of infectious choruses, there seems to be an even greater emphasis on catchiness here. Despite seeming like an odd single choice before the album's release, \"Breathing Lightning\" is a strong example of this as the catchy as hell vocal line works well with the more rock approach. In addition, songs like \"Monster At The End\" and \"Defend/Avenge\" are guaranteed to be stuck in your head for days while the vocal layering on \"Blood Eagle Wings\" makes the near eight minute long track even more inspiring.\n\nIt also helps that the styles are a little more jumbled here. In comparison to the fast to slow song progression on Worship Music, For All Kings is rather unpredictable and seems to jump styles between songs. While \"You Gotta Believe\" starts the album off on an upbeat note similar to \"Earth On Hell,\" the following tracks opt for a mid-tempo approach and songs like \"Zero Tolerance\" bring some speed toward the album's end.\n\nOverall, For All Kings is a good addition to Anthrax's discography, even if it does often feel like more of the same. It'd arguably leave more of an impact if it had come out a couple years ago, but it still manages to be pretty enjoyable on its own terms thanks to its earworm quality. Megadeth may be back on top as the most relevant part of the Big 4 but Anthrax shouldn't be reaching the Slayer levels of stagnancy anytime soon...\n\nHighlights:\n\"Monster At The End\"\n\"Breathing Lightning\"\n\"Blood Eagle Wings\"\n\"Defend/Avenge\"\n",
        "\nAnthrax can easily be considered the smallest of the big four of thrash metal. After the heyday of the genre, people were paying less attention to them than the other three, even more so than Slayer. However, it would seem that with the exception of Metallica, who have released nothing, they have all released their best works in years. The most recent has been Anthrax. Megadeth has released \"Dystopia\", which was a great album that was not a completely flawless effort by any means, but still very enjoyable. Slayer had released \"Repentless\", in 2015, which was not amazing, but exceptional when compared to their past works after the pinnacle of their career. I have now listened to the most recent, which is Anthrax's \"For All Kings\". The question that was circling around in my head was, \"Will this be the thrash-terpeice that we all need?\"...\n\nThis album is not a masterpiece. There are flaws with it that can be easily be pointed out. While the songwriting steers clear of predictability, it just doesn't seem all that captivating, or at least not as much as Megadeth's recorded greatness that had broken free in February. Although the music can be tedious at times, for the most part, it is quite enjoyable. Far superior to the album that was released five years prior to it. The straightforward, yet complex songwriting could not be complemented more that it is by the insanely heavy production. This is the finest production that I have ever witnessed on an Anthrax album. When I listen to the classics by this band, the thing that comes out most as a negative is the fact that the production should be a bit thicker. I would also say that \"Spreading the Disease\" could turn the volume up on the drums. This fixes that with ease, despite the lack of grittiness that we found on previous works.\n\nAlthough some of the music is opposing captivation, there are some truly great songs here. The title track is an anthem, yet it remains with sincerity. There is a lot of sincerity within the lyrics, but I feel as though this is one of the more thought-provoking ones. The melodic riffs complement this. Anthrax is a band that is known for being more melodic that the majority of their counterparts. However, I feel as though this album focuses more on heaviness than a big deal of aggression. I feel as though this song has more of that than other tracks. This is also present in tracks such as \"Evil Twin\", or \"Zero Tolerance\", which is the closing track of the album. It is enjoyable, music-wise, but lyrically, it is ridiculously cliche. Maybe a cover of Death would have been better. If they could make Joey's vocals work in some way.\n\nThe real star of the album is \"Blood Eagle Wings\". This is a thrash metal ballad, which is not easy to make. They did it right. This song has a very well-crafted structure and melody, as well as very inventive lyrics which cover a topic that many others have not covered in such a way, which is the fact that many of the great city's of the world were built from bloodshed and death. I first listened to this while watching the video of it, which definitely gets its moral across in a grotesque way. I do not enjoy this as much as a classic such as \"Madhouse\" or \"Caught in a Mosh\", but it is still my favorite heavy metal song to come out this year. It does not get the praise that it deserves, as it is definitely a song that does what a lot of others fail to do. It makes me feel.\n\nThis as a whole is similar to the rest of the music and lyrics on here. It is taking itself much more seriously than the past works in Anthrax's discography. This does not make it the best in their discography, but it was probably needed of them in modern times. They were in need of more focus and quality on an album. The lyrics go away from the celebration of the genre that they belong to and go into social/political commentary. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I would like to, but I still enjoy the various statements that are made.\n\nAnother standout that I must mention is the solo from \"Zero Tolerance\", which is easily one of the most chaotic and energetic that the band has ever given. It works well with the very punk-ish nature of the song, as well as the very fast tempo. Some of the other solos on the album are a bit forgettable. The solo on \"Blood Eagle Wings\" is definitely one that provokes a lot of emotion, just like the rest of the track, but this is where the lead guitar work is better than the rest, in terms of technicality and memorability.\n\nJoey's vocals are the final aspect that I feel the need to cover, as they could not fit in further than this, which is definitely a major surprise, considering that harsher vocals usually give a lot more charisma to music like this. This band has been doing this for years, but even with the increased heaviness that is present here, it still perfectly works. They just had to raise the vocals up in the mix. If there is one thing about this album that is consistently genius, it's the production. Definitely something that I can commend it for.\n\nFor All Kings is a truly good album. It has generally fine songwriting, enjoyable edgy lyrics, great vocals and phenomenal production. It showcases the maturity that this band is going through with very solid music that has sincerity, but with fun. You can't have an album done by this band, absent of that. Can this compete with their classics? No. Can it be placed on a higher platform than anything that followed? Absolutely. This is something that I'd started to doubt that Anthrax still had the ability to release anymore. Now, they did just that, but in a more serious way.\n",
        "\nFirst off, I write this review as someone who has listened to classic Anthrax albums always seemingly unable to get into the dated sound, excluding heavy metal classics such as \"Among the Living\", \"Madhouse\", \"Indians\", \"I Am The Law\" I found the majority of their tracks somewhat unmemorable. However this album has completely changed my perception of a classic heavy metal band.\n\nFor All Kings throughout seems to have been gifted with near perfect production, with the drums, rhythm guitar, and vocals all grabbing you from the balls. The bass compliments each and every song comfortably, where I find the only disappointment in the production scheme of things are the guitar solos. Don't get me wrong, throughout the album, newbie guitarist Jonathan Donais brings surprisingly fantastic fret work, but as the producer has decided to tone the sound down, it unjustly causes the listener to sometimes almost forget the solos, and never truly appreciate them as they should be in their glory.\n\nThe tracks on the album all vary from short to long lengths, with two instrumentals hidden in the first and fourth track on the album respectively, both enhancing the album as a listen. Scott Ian has provided some fantastic riffs in the album, most notably in album opener \"You Gotta Believe\" and other tracks such as the crushing \"Suzerain\" and also previously released single \"Evil Twin\" which has a humdinger of a intro riff. However the true essence of this album is not in what could've been a nostalgic failure of the band trying to recreate their 80's thundering thrash which was so popular in that era and is still revisited by many metal heads today. The true essence of this album is the melody Anthrax have implemented in this modern metal creation. Anthrax have gone the opposite direction of trying to please fans with the intention of creating a 'new Among The Living' and ending up making a poor thrash album like so many of their 80's thrash counterparts. Instead they have created catchy, melodic choruses with a lead guitar that at times instills a slower feeling into fantastic songs like \"Breathing Lightning\" and \"Blood Eagle Wings\" side by side with mouthwatering metal chunky riffs to the credit of Ian.\n\nThe true highlights in the creative side of Anthrax's \"For All Kings\" lie within the diversity of the first seven songs. Although the latter end of the album includes some decent songs such as \"This Battle Chose Us\" which includes attractive choruses from Joey Belladonna and a strong lyrical performance of the anti extremist song \"Zero Tolerance\". However the way in which the end of the album somewhat peters off, doesn't pay enough respect to the rest of the album, which truly is a great listen.\n",
        "\nHard though it is for me to act abrasive towards my favourite band ever, the 21st century has not been a generous era for Anthrax. Two great albums simply cannot eclipse the years of patience us die-hard fans have had to endure whilst tumultuous changes occurred within the quintet. It's safe to say the majority of us are ecstatic that Joey Belladonna has settled back into the frontman's position with ease. Also, the rock-solid pillar of Scott, Frank and Charlie remains confident and unmoved. It's only new arrival Jon Donais whose talents remain to be seen, but 2016's hugely anticipated \"For All Kings\" will reveal all...\n\nThe bottom line? It's fucking brilliant. Stop expecting a second \"Spreading The Disease\" or \"Among The Living\", because it's not 1986 anymore. This is melodic thrash metal for the 21st century, for now - and boy are New York's finest leading the way! This current effort is a whole hour of varied, dynamic, progressively-tinged gems which seem to echo the mammoth musical journey Anthrax have made over the past 35 years. It's got the stomping groove, it's got the full-tilt thrash, it's got the mellow soothers, it's got the theatrical atmosphere, it's got irregular rhythms - but most importantly - it's got a fistful of metal.\n\nAs in the equally varied \"Worship Music\", \"For All Kings\" sucks the audience in with a swelling, orchestral intro (featuring that cello the band seem to be so fond of!) before the slamming opening half of \"You Gotta Believe\" knocks them on their asses with a megaton of thrash metal goodness. If lyrics like \"you can die screaming\" and \"viciously impaled\" don't convince you that this is still the 'Thrax we know and love, then the monstrous groove at 2:12 sure as hell will. This is an excellent opener which will surely go down a storm in a live setting.\n\n\"For All Kings\" is wonderfully structured. Each track has had its position carefully selected so the listener is treated to a multi-dimensional mix of experiences. It allows the individual songs to stand out from each other with ease, each bringing something fresh to the table. The first half is a mixture of broad melodic tracks like \"Breathing Lightning\" and \"Monster At The End\" which wouldn't have sounded out of place on \"The Sound of White Noise\" - thrown in with the up-tempo thrashers like \"Evil Twin\" and the title-track. The title-track is a particular highlight, with its dramatic chorus and vicious main riff. \n\nAll band members are on top form this time round. Charlie's lightning-fast double-kick attacks are a welcome, familiar sound - complementing the crunchy production perfectly. Scott brought a plentiful bag o' riffs to this recording session, ensuring that there's never a creative slump. You only need to hear the first 20 seconds of \"Suzerain\" to be assured of his credentials as a riff-writer. Frankie's bass clangs away, reliable as ever, whilst Jon Donais' fresh leads bring a youthful vibrancy to the table. Not to mention the inimitable Joey Belladonna...yup, he's still got it! We'll have no naysayers here! It's only when a band is at their peak should they be comfortable enough to write shockers like \"Blood Eagle Wings\" - which WILL divide fans, no question!\n\nThe final third of \"For All Kings\" is sheer magic. \"Defend/Avenge\" is an uproarious thrash anthem (a thranthem, if you will) containing joyous riffage and barking, shout-along choruses straight out of \"Among The Living\". The hammering menace of \"All of Them Thieves\" paves the way for the perfect closer: \"Zero Tolerance\". It feels like the whole album was building up to this finale. Four minutes of non-stop, frenzied thrash metal with a generous dose of that classic East Coast sarcastic humour we've missed so much from Joey: \"What would your God say to that, motherfuckers?\", \"I am fire, I am death...I'm out!\". Where has this Anthrax been for the past 25 years?! Welcome back, boys!\n\nWith Slayer's disappointing \"Repentless\" flying their flag, and Metallica still doing absolutely fuck all worth mentioning - the 'big four' is currently half as iterated. But it's being fired up again thanks to Megadeth's awesome \"Dystopia\"...and now Anthrax's \"For All Kings\". The NOT man can bare his cheeky grin once more and all die-hard fans can breathe an enormous sigh of relief. \"Worship Music\" may have been a commercial success, but now the 'Thrax have really tapped in to their inner thrash metal vein, and are ready to take on the world once more.\n\n\"For all kings committed!\nFor all kings old and new!\nYoung blood of the old blood,\nFor all kings are through!\"\n",
        "\n''For All Kings'' is Anthrax's newest studio release and it is very similar to its predecessor ''Worship Music''. This album is very diversified, melodic and modern. Let me explain what that actually means. From melodic alternative rock anthems over instrumental interludes to mean thrash metal stompers with a solid dose of punk spirit both musically and lyrically, this album summarizes almost everything the band has tried out in its career but adds some fresh enthusiasm and consistent high quality song writing. This is also the band's most melodic album. Especially new guitarist Jonathan Donais really shines here and adds a more modern and quite catchy tone to the thrash metal legend. I must also point out Joey Belladonna's energizing, juvenile and melodic vocal performance. He has always been my favourite singer of this band and his gifted vocals distinguish this band from other genre bands who might have charismatic but ultimately technically less talented performers. Our Native American frontman really delivers his best career performance so far on this output. This new album can be called modern because the production is precise but not polished. The rhythm section is the powerful backbone of this record while vocals and guitar sounds have a few efficient sound effects here and there. Some songs on this album have traditional heavy and thrash metal sounds that should please the more conservative fans. Those who liked the band's more experimental phase during the nineties might also find a few interesting passages here and there even though this is only a subcategory on this record. The album offers a lot more catchier, shorter and more modern alternative rock and metal passages that could actually get some mainstream radio airplay if the band really tried to become more popular. ''For All Kings'' would actually be an appropriate album for younger audiences to discover the world of metal music. To all open-minded teenagers with a weakness for rock music out there: go ahead and try this record out!\n\nEven though some band members described this album as a heavier output that goes back to the band's earlier albums, I would rather disagree. If you liked ''Worship Music'', you will equally fall in love with ''For All Kings'' but if you are expecting a youthful thrash metal revival, you should look elsewhere. Since I admired the predecessor, I'm also satisfied with this album even though some of the new material needs a few more spins to open up if compared to the infectious previous strike. The most accessible songs can be found in the strong middle section of this album. ''Breathing Lightning'' is a very melodic and uplifting song that you won't get out of your mind. The guitar melodies sound harmonious and positive and the vocals are refreshingly liberating. The track has both a proper introduction and an instrumental coda as a short separated track. The songs builds up a majestic yet honest atmosphere that is crowned by an efficient chorus. It's one of the band's mellowest yet one of their best songs ever.\n\nThe coda entitled ''Breathing Out'' leads to my personal highlight ''Suzerain'' that starts with heavier guitar work and an energizing rhythm section. The song then gets a more mysterious and sinister tone just to surprise you with a catchy, melodic and positive chorus which is simply unforgettable. The hypnotizing vocal performance is spot on and I feel like singing along to this track all the time these days.\n\n''Evil Twin'' is one of the straightest tunes on here and mixes vivid heavy and thrash metal elements in equal parts. The lyrics are very interesting and comment on the events that shook up France last year, especially the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Since thrash metal is closely inspired by hardcore punk music which is a genre that regularly comments political and social events, the combination of meaningful lyrics and a meaner sound works perfectly. Especially the chorus with lyrics such as \"You represent your discontent slaughtering the innocent - Insolence, you're no martyrs - The arrogance to reinvent - The holy words their meanings bent - Evil twins, you're no martyrs!\" offers some food for thought, remembrance and debates. \n\nThe album closer ''Zero Tolerance'' has a very similar tone and is the band's most vivid album closer since the unchained anti-conformist statement ''Imitation of Life'' twenty-nine years earlier on the legendary ''Among the Living'' album. ''Zero Tolerance'' starts as a focused heavy metal tune before it turns into a fast thrash metal anthem. The band makes a very important statement in the middle part of this track: ''Zero tolerance for extremism - in the name of religion - zero tolerance for racial hate - no police state - zero tolerance for politicians - on the left and the right - zero tolerance for killing children'' before adding the pissed off question ''What would your God say to that, motherfuckers?\". Usually, I don't like profanity in lyrics but in this case, the angry attitude is spot on and offers once again some food for thought, remembrance and debates. \n\nIn conclusion, Anthrax offers a diversified, melodic and modern output with lyrics on the pulse of time. This logical sequel to ''Worship Music'' proves that Anthrax is back for good and offers the most consistent present day efforts among their genre colleagues. This one hour of positive power might reunite traditional heavy metal fans, thrash metal maniacs and younger audiences with a weakness for modern metal. ''For All Kings'' might have a couple of average tunes but the greatest tracks are so close to perfection that this album can already be considered a serious candidate for album of the year. If the American quintet comes close to your town for a show with this new material, you know what you have to do.\n",
        "\nI am completely new to the new Anthrax, I haven't heard even one song off of Worship Music (I did hear the little cover EP and it wasn't bad) and I haven't heard anything from John Bush except for Sound of White Noise (that album can suck it) so this has been an interesting listen for me. Anthrax is one of the thrash bands that I have the most respect for, they have always been Anthrax, they aren't cocky sellouts and they don't beat the same formula into the dirt like some other bands do. They also aren't conforming to that atrocious \"new\" age of production in which the guitars sound like shit and the focal point of everything is the double bass. I honestly didn't know what to expect in listening to this, but I must say, this is good. Actually, I'm surprised, this is very good. I was not expecting anything like this, 'Thrax have proven once again that they rule with another great album. This is really refreshing to listen to, I see it as a continuation of what Persistence of Time was doing, which is a good thing; the goofy Anthrax is totally gone in favor of the heavier, more focused Anthrax. These guys will never, ever, best what they did on some of their older albums, but with this collection of fresh and creative metal songs they are only adding more and more to what makes Anthrax awesome. \n\nThe songs on \"For All Kings\" are pretty diverse, with each containing different songwriting elements that keep everything fresh. Most of these are adhering to a more mid-paced formula full of more melodic and catchy chorus' and musical sections. Some of these riffs and ideas are downright spectacular and I have got to give Scott some props for continuing what he does best. The more simplistic riffs are reinforced by some spectacular drumming by charlie. He really has always been one of my favorite metal drummers, and he is fantastic on this album. It sounds like I could be talking about any of the old Anthrax albums with descriptions like that, but this is definitely not the case. The talent of these guys is still refreshing and full of energy and ideas. Most of the modern thrash that I hear is just a try-hard attempt at being brutal or being heavier then the last album or whatever, but For All Kings actually sounds like Anthrax were full of ideas and had the will power to actually put together a good album. Tracks like \"Evil Twin\", \"Suzerain\", \"Defend/Avenge\", \"This Battle Chose Us\", and the best on the album, \"Breathing Lightning\" are all spectacular showcases of a band that definitely still has the stuff. The most striking thing about this album is by far its very melodic and atmospheric tendency. This is very obvious in the title track and \"Breathing Lightning\", and also in \"Suzerain\". A great example of what I mean is on the track \"Breathing Lightning\", which begins with a soft, and quite beautiful clean intro before blasting off into some wicked riffs until the awesome chorus. The \"Angels sing\" section of this song is one of my favorite moments on the album, it's beautiful, and after that part ends you get a taste of how wicked the new guy is with some awesome leads. Using words like \"Beautiful\" when describing a metal album might sound a bit weird, but it's a refreshing and exhilarating experience to hear some modern metal that actually steps outside the box to do something creative. It really does get annoying hearing the same thing re-hashed over and over again, and that is something that I think most of the newer metal bands can't wrap their head around, i'm glad Anthrax realizes this. Don't get me wrong, this album is still a heavy freaking metal album all the way, with burly riffs and thrashy drums, but It's nice to see that these guys are still exploring and experimenting as a band, and I gotta say, it paid off. \n\nSo while the songwriting is totally new and refreshing, the instrumentation is on par with the usual Anthrax that I'm used to. Scott still riffs like a beast, Charlie is still playing some of the very best drums out there too. Good 'ol Injun Joe has definitely still got it, even though he can't still hit those crazy highs. He doesn't try to push his voice too far at all though, he knows his limits and he makes sure to make the most and then some out of his voice, props to you Joey. Frank is a beast on this album, as always. He is playing with a heavier, more thicker bass tone that fits the album wonderfully. I have to give some major props to the new guy: Jon Donais, this guy is awesome! I have no idea where this dude came from but damn he is great. His solos are all fantastic. He is not an all out shredder, but he has some wicked chops and I really appreciate his melodic take on the leads, it works great. The production is some of the best I've ever heard. Everything is balanced perfectly, and when I crank the volume, everything has this badass punch that a lot of modern metal albums don't have. I don't know how Anthrax did it, but I'm impressed, it is almost as if they are a completely rejuvenated band. \n\nI have been listening to this album nonstop for a while now, it is honestly fantastic. Some people are probably thinking that I'm just sucking up to this because I am an Anthrax fan, but I'll have you know, I hate modern thrash almost completely, that includes the stuff by the old bands. So when my sis told me that this album was amazing, I was super skeptical until I popped it into the player. While the first track, \"You Gotta Believe\" is by far the weakest on the album, the album just gets better and better. I still can't get over how good \"Breathing Lightning\" alone is, definitely my favorite on the album. Overall, this is outstandingly consistent and fresh. I didn't want to give this album a good score at first, because new metal doesn't really hold up to the classic stuff, I was wrong to expect mediocrity from this record, it's fantastic. I highly recommend this to any other skeptics out there, and all fans of all kinds of metal should definitely pick this up. I am so pleasantly surprised by this album, and I'll probably listen to this one as much as I do the others, I've been listening non-stop since its release and it keeps getting better. Bravo Anthrax. \n\n\"You always have the chance to do the right thing \nUntil the right thing comes undone\nAnd with a thunderclap I\u2019m breathing lightning\nAnd this world has moved on\nI look inside myself is this the right thing?\nIs this the right thing, I don\u2019t know\"\n",
        "\nt\u2019s 2016, bands that were in their twenties during the eighties and released youthful energetic albums, have aged, just like us. No one in his right mind expects a new Peace Sells, Reign In Blood or Master Of Puppets. Impossible. So the main question here is not have Anthrax gone back in time and done another Spreading The Disease or Among The Living but have they made a worthy follow\u2013up to Worship Music.\n\nWell; to put my conclusion here: For All Kings (4AK from now on) is simply better than Worship Music. Worship was an album I gave 70 points here because it was very unbalanced and trying to please fans from different eras just too much. And that\u2019s still how I feel about it all these years later.\n\n4AK is a lot more cohesive than Worship was. Worship was mostly written in a period when Anthrax were clearly unsure who they actually were or planned to become and the album sounded like it. A mixed bag with, honestly, only a handful of stand-out songs that stood the test of time like \u2018Fight \u2019Em\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m Alive\u2019 and \u2018In The End\u2019. 4AK has more in common with the principle idea behind Spreading The Disease when it comes to combining faster material with more slower and melodic material. However the songs here sound nothing like that era. Anthrax sound much poppier and darker at the same time. Again they have presented us with an album that could be placed, stylewise, between Persistence of Time and Sound Of White Noise but with even more melody. Much more melody than they ever had really. The pace is just not as high anymore as on their first 4 studio albums although a few thrashers are present.\n\nIf you like Anthrax a bit more old school, with more speed and energy, then you can\u2019t go wrong with these four songs: \u201cYou Gotta Believe\u201d, \u201cFor All Kings\u201d, \u201cEvil Twin\u201d and especially \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d, the fastest song they\u2019ve done with Joey since\u2026 well, since \u2018Discharge\u2019 on Persistence albeit far more melodic, vocally. I am sure these 4 songs will please Anthrax fans from all eras.\n\nIt\u2019s the rest of the album that\u2019s a mixed bag. \u2018Monster at the End\u2019 could\u2019ve come straight from Worship. It\u2019s in the same vein as \u2018I\u2019m Alive\u2019, a simple midpaced tune that misses real stand-out riffs and balls but somehow grows on you because it\u2019s so damn catchy! \u2018Defend / Avenge\u2019 at first might come over as more of the same un-fast grooving material the band has filled several of their less classic albums with, but turns out to grow on the listener. There are great tempo changes to be found, catchy riffs and Belladonna really makes it shine!\n\n\u2018Breathing Lightning\u2019 is interesting. It\u2019s a poppy tune. Before releasing the single the band claimed it had an epic chorus. When it finally came out, it was underwhelming and not everybody was equally enthusiastic. In official publications on social media the band still claim they only get positive responses to the song but my experience, in Europe, has been rather different. A lot of folks just find it way too cheesy and poppy. I must say it\u2019s not among my faves on the album but it has grown on me as part of the album. It\u2019s not one of those song I \u2018skip\u2019. The verses contain a riff that could\u2019ve come straight from any Megadeth album in the 1992-1997 period (don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t hear it! It has \u2018Mustaine\u2019 all over it) and if you imagine John Bush singing it, it wouldn\u2019t have sounded out of place on \u2018We\u2019ve come For You All\u2019 yet on 4AK it\u2019s a fun moment of relative relaxation.\n\nHowever, like on most Anthrax albums since 1990, it\u2019s the amount of filler that once again tempers the enthusiasm. Best of the rest is \u2018Blood Eagle Wings\u2019 which is only damaged by it\u2019s very, very poor chorus but apart from that is a pretty great song. Especially after the 3:15 minute mark the song really comes to life with a beautiful riff and great vocal melody.\n\n\u2018Suzerain\u2019 has a great opening riff and throughout the song a few good variations on it. But the song as a whole never erupts and has pretty much one of the dullest choruses on the album. \u2018All of Them Thieves\u2019 and \u2018This Battle Chose Us\u2019 are utter filler. Even more obvious because the band contrived an upbeat part for both songs to give\u2019m more \u2018edge\u2019. Fun parts, maybe, but they just can\u2019t save mediocre songs.\n\nShould I say something about new lead guitarist Jonathan Donais? Well, I shall. I love his leads! He might be a salt pillar on stage but his leads are awesome. He does, what I call, \u2018an Adrian Smith\u2019 here. Catchy leads which also shred. My favorite stuff on lead guitar since Sound Of White Noise!\n\nThe artwork and title of the album? Well, it\u2019s Manowar-like tongue-in-cheek humor. You either like it or don\u2019t. I personally feel the majority of songs is not as epic as the cover implies. But I like it nonetheless. It\u2019s pretty iconic and I love the colours.\n\n59 minutes of music with about 20 minutes of it rather useless. They could\u2019ve left out 3 or maybe even 4 of the worst tracks and this album could\u2019ve gotten a 90-95 point review from me, being hailed as the best BigFour album in about, uhm, 22 years. In it\u2019s current form with much filler, I\u2019ll stick to 80 points.\n\nStand-out songs: \u201cYou Gotta Believe\u201d, \u201cFor All Kings\u201d, \u201cEvil Twin\u201d and \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d.\nTurds: \u201cAll of Them Thieves\u201d and \u201cThis Battle Chose Us\u201d\n",
        "\nAnthrax has been something of a wild card in recent years, both in relation to the media manufactured \"Big 4\", as well as with the broader school of thrash, be it the modern subset or the revivalist throwback crowd. They arguably ended up falling the hardest and losing their identity the quickest in the carnage of the American rock scene of the 90s, largely due to an artificial and jolting set of evolutionary shifts in style to try and placate covetous record labels and fickle fans, but also in part due to an inability to gel with Joey Belladonna's replacement John Bush. But with a slow and methodical recovery of their brand after some sizable bumps in the road in the mid 2000s, they managed a respectable offering in Worship Music, which while not a complete throwback to the glory days, was nevertheless a needed shot in the arm of a band that had been comatose for the better part of 20 years. Almost exactly five years to the date of the release of said album, and with minimal disruption to their lineup, For All Kings continues and expands upon the ground broken by its predecessor and leans a bit closer to where they left off with Persistence Of Time.\n\nAlong with other Big 4 mainstay Megadeth, Anthrax has decided to pull in some younger blood for their lead guitar wizardry, though in this case taking in a metalcore ax-man in Jonathan Donais rather than a power metal virtuoso from Brazil. While Anthrax has always been more recognizable for Scott Ian's riff work, Charlie B's insane drumming and a smoother and more melodically tinged vocal performance, Donais' fancy lead guitar input is a welcome addition and puts this album in similar territory in terms of technical detailing to where Metallica was at the height of their popularity in the 80s. But in contrast to Megadeth's recent turn towards a streamlined thrashing formula that reflects their 80s sound on Dystopia, For All Kings is not quite as steeped in guitar shredding and functions more as one of those longer winded, progressive-leaning albums that was being explored by the thrash world in the early 1990s just before the groove sound took over. It's been taken a step further with a heavy degree of orchestration and atmospheric ballad elements that give things more of an epic feel and a stylistic tinge more common to a power/thrash sound, but this album could be chalked up to the long awaited successor to Persistence Of Time that many Anthrax band has been hoping for since Belladonna returned to the fold.\n\nThough the songs are a bit on the longer side for the style and the pacing is a bit more moderated compared to the mayhem that typified Among The Living and pretty much everything Anthrax put out before that, the energy and infectious hooks are by no means in short supply. Chasing a fully orchestrated and dramatic sounding instrumental \"Impaled\" and building gradually from a mid-paced crunch to an up tempo cruiser, \"You Gotta Believe\" brings a strong sense of nostalgia for the more commercially viable and stripped down character of State Of Euphoria, embodying something of a more elaborate version of \"Be All, End All\". This sort of measured, tactical employment of speed with a greater degree of mid-paced build up is generally echoed through most of the longer offerings on here, particularly \"Breathing Lightning\" and \"Blood Eagle Wings\", incorporating a heavy degree of atmospheric elements to complement the sparing use of sheer impact-based riffing and shred-happy solo work, and coming off almost like a power metal oriented approach similar to what Megadeth was toying with in the mid-1990s. But bringing up the opposite end of the spectrum are a couple of truly riveting speed thrashers in \"Evil Twin\" and \"Zero Tolerance\", followed by with a slightly less overt shot of intensity out of the title song \"For All Kings\".\n\nAs with any recent outing by one of the original stalwarts of the style, it's important to approach an album like this with a reasonable expectation that it won't be an exact replica of what came out of this band's golden era (1984-1990), though it gets a hell of a lot closer to that than any recent Metallica offers or the last Slayer debacle. Thankfully Anthrax was forthcoming in the generally mixed stylistic character of this album, opting to lead it off with something representing their 80s efforts in their first single and a more laid back, rocking and melodic number in \"Breathing Lightning\" for their second. It's a slightly more polished and engaging improvement over Worship Music, but generally has a similar composition of old and new, with maybe a slight bit more of their pre-Bush influences and arguably the fanciest assortment of lead guitar breaks in this band's 30 years plus history. The only thing that hopefully doesn't happen in the future is for it to take another five long years for this band to do this again.\n",
        "\nAnthrax is one of thrash metal's \"big 4\", together with Metallica, Slayer and Megadeth. Anthrax was always most playful of them all already in 1980s, best known from their flirtation with (gasp!) rap music. In 1990 the band had released their most mature, and slower, thrash metal album, 'Persistence of Time'. And then Joey Belladonna left...\n\nWith new vocalist John Bush came another change: Anthrax took more and more steps towards more groovy presentation with fine 1993 album 'Sound of White Noise'. Then Dan Spitz left, who played most of the lead guitar parts. Maybe it means something, that Mr. Spitz didn't write anything for 'Sound...' album any more, even though he never was a main writer for the band. Maybe he didn't want the band to get too groovy, rocking?\n\nSo, welcome to the first Anthrax album, that can be said to contain groove metal, and nothing else. Back when it was released, it might have sounded heavy as the ball of metal junk (no pun intended) on the cover. On the other hand, it looks more like a rock album artwork. Guys were around 30 years old, and new winds were blowing. So many bands tried to survive the attack of grunge rock by making changes in their sound and songwriting in early 1990s. The album is rocking and at times, punky, and those nu-metal whiffs featured aren't so much of killjoy as they could have been! Anthrax, generally, still did things by their own book.\n\nScott Ian's guitar riffing is heavy-handed. He does hammering palm-muted stuff, plays a lot with open strings and generally keeps things pretty simple. Some are simple as heck, hence the punk vibe here and there around the album. Anyway, it can be heard, that Scott's fingers must have been mash after recording sessions... Surely you hear heavy metal here, and 'American Pompeii's Black Sabbath influenced riffing that starts just before 3-minute mark is one shining example of that! Then again, there's not much of memorable stuff happening in lead and solo guitar departments. Paul Crook was enlisted as the lead guitarist, but his work was to throw in some noisy leads and solos ('In a Zone' features one of the more memorable ones, and surely there are a few more). Dimebag Darrell of Pantera fame guested on two songs, but he didn't conjure anything that could be called as legendary here. The guitars sound live.\n\nMelodies are brought in by vocals by John Bush (Armored Saint). His lines are memorable, but again, rather simplistic. I like his rough-ish voice; you can hear he has lived. And not too strictly. This can be sensed from the lyrics, too, which are very streetwise. Fighting, drinking, anxiety, fucking society. Mr. Bush also does more clean vocals on 'Nothing', which is one of the catchiest songs on offer. Also so on 'Bare', which is a bit surprising semi-acoustic closer, where Bush manages to sound somewhat similar to Kurt Cobain. Generally, his vocals are raw, without much, if any, effects and such. The vocals sound live.\n\nThe rhythm section in Anthrax have always been more or less vivid. No lack of ideas in bass and drums departments! Charlie Benante is one of my favourite drummers ever. He just lives the beat. His simpler stuff always contains some tasty small tricks to enjoy about, and dan he is a real octopus is he wants to be. And you can bet he does! All of the music was written by drummer him, so that probably explains why it is so very rhythm-based. Frank Bello's bass is one of the funkiest in metal without being any lame. The rhythm section is, n a word, versatile. The bass and drums sound live.\n\nSo, the album sounds live! It sounds raw. It's not a presentation of balanced and clean production job, but while it's full, it's not clogged by any means. No, even though a lot of musical elements stay on lower levels.\n\n'Stomp 442' is definitely better than the next one, 'Volume 8 - The Threat Is Real!', which was released as late as 1998. Here, the variety isn't so big, but on the other hand it could have been better in general songwriting; this is quite unvaried. However, the songs have their own vibes mostly for sure. I've managed to find something good in each of them, and the years do not seem to corrode them. Still, 'Stomp 442' is a remnant of mid-90s. It feels it has some similarities with early Machine Head, The Almighty's 'Crank' (1994) and even Helmet, just to name a few. This is a party record or one I love to listen to while driving my automobile.\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nAnthrax has always seemed the smallest of the Big 4, however recently you could argue that they\u2019ve certainly been the best. While Metallica bask in their own popularity and constantly postpone any work towards recording new material, while Megadeth are recovering from their \u201cSuper Collider\u201d flop in 2013 and while everyone\u2019s throats become sore from shouting \"SLAYERRRR\" so much to distract themselves from the fact they haven\u2019t actually done anything daring in 10 years, Anthrax have been rising in leaps and bounds.\n\nIf you need another reason to suspect that Anthrax are back on track from their lengthy hiatus, other than 2011\u2019s \u201cWorship Music\u201d, then \u201cFor All Kings\u201d will certainly convince you. They still prove that they are metal thrashing mad fanatics of the genre with tracks such as \u2018Defend Avenge\u2019 and \u2018This Battle Chose Us\u2019 where strong riffs trample through with no finesse and crazy solos spring out from nowhere. \u2018You Gotta Believe\u2019 displays their melodious side with airy harmonies that become potent hooks to thrash metal however it still delivers a fine dish of (albeit slow) cat-and-mouse rhythms from guitars and drums alike.\n\nThe talent behind the instrumentation of Anthrax is showcased equally between all members on \u201cFor All Kings\u201d. On \u2018Suzerain\u2019 founding members Scott Ian and Charlie Benante show no signs of aging despite it being 35 years since Anthrax\u2019s conception. Whenever a blast beat explodes into action, Banante particularly exhibits his percussion precision as if he still maintains his youthfulness of the 80\u2019s that will give any fan of metal a good ol\u2019 thrashgasm. New to the band is former Shadows Fall guitarist, Jon Donias. While his predecessor Rob Caggiano was a great ingredient to Anthrax, his absence is barely noticeable as the melodies and solos in \u2018All Of Them Thieves\u2019 proves that Donias is a worthy replacement and has clear respect for the role of being a guitarist for one of the most popular thrash bands around. Frank Bello is an effective bass where he provides bounciness rather than solemnity to the downbeat bass however on the animated \u2018Blood Eagle Wings\u2019 his bass is shrouded behind his energetic band members by unfocused production.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the hardcore punk aspect of Anthrax then Joey Belladonna is the place to start. The radicalising and condemning lyrics in \u2018Evil Twin\u2019 depict the vicious French Charlie Hebdo shootings in 2015 where Joey describes the evil twin as the person behind the savage massacre of the innocent compared to their humane twin. With a lyrical theme as strong as this his snarling performance is just as powerful. Furthermore, the satirical quality of hardcore and punk is mimicked on \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 where Joey describes terrorism in lyrics such as \u201czero tolerance for extremism/racial hate/killing children\u201d and the brief cry of \u201cWhat have you got to say to that mother fuckers?!\u201d before a tirade of Scott\u2019s furious solos symbolise their lividness with a -quite literal- zero tolerance attitude.\n\nScott Ian described \"For All Kings\" as \u201cthe most metal album they have recorded in years.\u201d As clich\u00e9d as this statement is, he\u2019s not lying. Anthrax out do themselves once more with another album that, in recent times, puts their esteemed colleagues to shame-again.\n",
        "\nAnthrax is known for a somewhat humorous flavor of thrash, they unleashed a streak of very awesome albums in the 80's that were all creative and unique, making quite a name for themselves; thus earning them a spot in the so-called \"Big Four\". But in 1990, a new breed of Anthrax was born. Persistence of Time was much darker and heavier both musically and lyrically. These riffs are Scott's downright most heavy and menacing, Joey sounds angry and evil at times, Charlie and Frank even adopt a wicked, heavy as fudge take to the rhythm section. Generally this album doesn't get nearly as much recognition as the first four, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Persistence of Time is a very good record, and their new formula works quite well. Much to my surprise, this definitely stands up to their earlier material. \n\nThe first thing you'll notice about the songs on this album is that they are all pretty dang long, especially for an Anthrax release. Right from the get-go the album features three seven minute tracks, followed by a six and a half minute number. Dang. These guys mean business, I bought the album only knowing \"Got the Time\", and I'll admit I had no idea what to expect from this CD. Turns out, their new approach works extremely well for them. Anthrax had released only two similar songs, \"Horror of it All\", which is like my second favorite Anthrax song, and \"Who Cares Wins\", which was terrible and boring. But here, all of the long and more involved tracks work excellently. In my opinion, \"Time\" is one of the weakest on the album, but it's a fan favorite, so I guess it wasn't a miss. \"Blood\" and \"Keep it in the Family\" both rule for a combined heavy as hell 14 minutes. \"Keep it in the Family\" is without a doubt my favorite on the album, and in my opinion the best. It has the most crushing riffs and bassline, and Joey knocks it out of the park on this one. The rest of the album, while a tad shorter, is just as heavy and dark. The only fast song on the entire album is \"Got the Time\", which is a cover anyway. \"Got the Time\" is aggressive, fast, and features some brilliant bass work by Frank. The entire last half of the album is awesome, and is reminiscent of some of the older Anthrax. My biggest problem with this otherwise outstanding release, are \"Time\" and \"Gridlock\". \"Gridlock\" is painfully weak, and it sounds awkward and forced. All in all though, Persistence of Time is an hour of heavy, dark, and crushing heavy metal that is done very well. It feels like this was an experiment for Anthrax, and it was quite risky, but they pulled it off in a magnificent way. \n\nThe instrumentation on Persistence of Time is quite different from the earlier albums, like I said. The quick riffs are scrapped in favor of a heavier and chuggier riffing structure. Everything is slowed down significantly, but that doesn't mean the playing is bad. Everyone is top notch as usually here. Dan's leads are more structured and less frenetic, and are all strong and creative. Joey's vocals, like I said earlier, are a lot more dark and evil sounding. He manages to avoid sounding funny or goofy here, and he does a great job fitting the more somber tone of a lot of the music. Charlie has always been an amazing drummer, and he is top notch as usual here. Frank has always been one of my favorite bass players, and here he is loud, aggressive, and his basslines chug along awesomely. His performance on \"Got the Time\" deserves a freakin' medal, his bass solo in the middle is very creative and it rocks. The whole band has a very solid performance here, and generally all of the songs are well put together and interesting, whether or not I like them all.\n\nOverall, Persistence of Time is a great album, a little overrated by a few Anthrax fans, but definitely an excellent release. I really dig the atmosphere the album has looming over it, and these riffs are sometimes crushingly badass. \"Keep it in the Family\" is one of my all-time favorite Anthrax tracks, and is one of the best slower paced thrash songs I have ever heard. This album took a while to grow on me, I only picked it up because I saw it was cheap, but honestly this is well worth any kind of money, and I gotta thank my friend for telling me to check this out. I recommend this to all heavy and thrash metal fans, and those who are looking for more great Anthrax besides Among the Living. Check this out, it's worth your time.\n",
        "\nAfter the awesomeness that was Spreading the Disease and Among the effing Living, Anthrax really set the bar pretty darn high. They had established a unique, heavy, and humorous thrash formula that they used to put out some of the best songs of the genre. Among the Living is a classic to this day and is a nearly flawless thrash album, and while it was an absolutely outstanding record, it left a shadow looming down over the band: how the fudge were they going to put together another batch of thrash cookies that could stand up to Among the Living? Well they did with State of Euphoria. While it is not nearly as fantastic as Among the Living, it is indeed a very solid album with some awesome tracks and moments. \n\nState of Euphoria is both similar and different to Among the Living in a couple of ways. The classic Anthrax sound we all know and love is definitely here and the humor and quirkiness is also back. It is different in that there is a definite darker feel to the music (You would not expect that from the goofy bright yellow album art). The riffs are sometimes more menacing and heavier, while those from Among the Living and Spreading the Disease especially were much faster and not nearly as dark. Nearly all of the tracks are mid-paced in tempo, and if your an Anthrax fan, you know what to expect from the song layout on nearly all of these. All of the songs are very similar, yet just different enough to make it a good album rather than a bland collection of the same song over and over. The only exceptions are \"Who Cares Wins\", the weakest song on the album by far, and \"Finale\", which is one of the more enjoyable tracks that features a unique and badass riff. \"Who Cares Wins\" is quite meh, it starts off like it might be decent, but it turns out to be quite the bland number. It is also far too long and it really drags on, unlike \"Horror of it All\" (a similarly constructed song of a similar length) from the last album which was absolutely amazing and probably being their best song. One thing I will criticize is that a lot of the verses on the album are kinda weak. Its not like they are bad its just that they seem a little uninspired, especially when compared to the verses of great Anthrax songs from \"Indians\" or \"Lone Justice\", and I take a few points off of the album because of this. \n\nMy favorite songs on State of Euphoria, and which are in my opinion the best songs on the record are \"Now it's Dark\", \"Schism\", \"Finale\", and the Trust cover \"Antisocial\". They do an excellent job on the Trust cover, especially taking into account that it was originally sung in French. \"Schism\" is a classic 'Thrax track, and \"Now It's Dark\" has a very cool intro, a really awesome chorus, and the best riff on the album towards the middle. The rest of the songs, with the exception of the bland \"Who Cares Wins\" and the weird little \"13\", are all really good songs as well. \n\nThe musicianship and instrumentation on here is pretty good. It is not nearly as tight and fast as some of Anthrax's earlier stuff but it is still decent. It is almost as if Anthrax are taking a more simplistic approach to the riffs and songwriting, its not laziness (cough cough Metallica cough cough) but more of a straightforward approach. The riffs Scott pumps out are all great, but not amazing. This is probably my favorite album for Dan Spitz though, his soloing is actually really good here, it is not nearly as frenetic, but more melodic and I have to give him props for that. Charlie Benante's drumming is fantastic as usual with lots of tasteful yet powerful drum lines backing up the songs. He is one of my favorite thrash drummers for sure. Frank Bello is one of my favorite bass players of all time, he is an absolute beast of bassist fusing the techniques of two of the greatest bass players of all time: heaviness of Geezer Butler and the fills and precision of Steve Harris. All that being said, his bass playing is great here, but not nearly as great as the other three records from this lineup and time period. Joey is one of thrash's best vocalists as well, but in my opinion this is his weakest vocal performance. It is definitely good, but kinda washed up sounding. This would change for Persistence of Time, he ruled on that one just as he did on Among the Living. Overall the musicianship is great, but definitely could be better, and I deduct a little more from the score due to that. \n\nOverall, State of Euphoria is a great release and it does stand up to Among the Living. It is not nearly as great as its predecessor or the beast to come after it. It is full of great thrash tracks and it is a really enjoyable listen. I recommend this to fans of heavy and thrash metal and to Anthrax fans who are unsure whether to get this album. It is definitely worth adding to the collection, I was definitely surprised with the quality, as I heard it was mediocre. It is not at all mediocre, but it is not quite excellent either. All in all, a very solid album that won't disappoint if you check it out. \"Over, Finished, Gone, Done, Out!\"\n",
        "\nAnthrax's foray into commercial alternative rock in the early to mid '90s yielded mixed results. At worst, you got garbage like practically everything from Stomp 442 and forgettable grunge like '1000 Points Of Hate'. At best, you got the rather catchy and pleasing 'Only' and the little gem that is this single's title track. 'Black Lodge' is a soothing and laid back experimental song, driven largely by a melancholic keyboard line, with the simple grunge guitar riff coming through in the memorable chorus. A small, formulaic but nice solo is found within, and all is well. It is a highly atmospheric yet distinctly commercial song that summons up the best possible aspects of '90s commercial rock with its fuzzy guitars and Layne Staley worship vocals.\n\nClearly the band knew that this was their best song, because the single features not one, but TWO versions of the same fucking song consecutively. The difference, as a descriptor like 'Black Strings Mix' would suggest, is that the keyboards have been replaced by a strings section following the same notes and melody as before. The intro has been changed up for a fade in, and overall the song possesses a better sense of dynamics as the strings are far quieter than the keyboards. It merely accentuates the atmosphere found in the normal track, and why on earth they couldn't make this the title track is beyond me. \n\nAll is well so far then, right? Just an issue of redundancy, right? Uh, no, because this single features two completely worthless b-sides after those. The first is a quirky, trippy and absolutely shite electronic remix of one of the band's better '90s tracks, 'Potters Field'. Al Jourgensen did it, and it just places these shitty electronic effects over the original song and makes it all juddery in places, as well as making it overly loud or quiet, removing any sense of dynamics. The solid groove thrasher that once was has turned into some electro-plonking piece of shit that no one would ever want to listen to. Why bands did this in the '90s I will never know, though at least they didn't do this to a classic track (*cough*MEGADETH*cough*) and forever pissed on their legacy!\n\nAnd the last song is a KISS cover. I have never heard the original version of this, but I can tell you now that the vocals sound really sloppy and awkward; no way the original was that bad. The instruments are decent enough, though the fuzzy guitars don't suit the happy rock riffs of this, they go better with darker things like that riff to 'Only'. Nothing else of note here though, I don't hear anything out of the ordinary (which suggests a faithfulness to the original), it is just going through the motions, being boring filler.\n\nLooking at the contents of this, I can see why the digital equivalent of the B-side never took hold. Most of them were pure garbage, hence why they weren't found anywhere else. If you really are an Anthrax completionist like myself, a 16-track Japanese version of Sound of White Noise exists, featuring all but the strings mix from this (and a bit more) - and that strings mix can be found on other versions of said album. Don't bother with this shit, because look at what it boils down to: TWO fucking versions of the same song that are really similar, one boring cover and one GODAWFUL electro remix of a track we have already heard. \n\nNeedless to say: FUCKING AVOID!\n",
        "\nThe road to Anthrax's recovery from the great tragedy that befell thrash metal otherwise known as the 1990s has been a slow and painful one, perhaps eclipsed only by Metallica's, which has yet to start. Nevertheless, it can be rightly argued that the New York standard bearers of thrash eliminated the principle problem a little over 10 years ago, namely John Bush. This association is not itself a reflection of John being a poor vocalist given his respectable work with Armored Saint, but nothing he put out when working with Anthrax is really worth a tankard of piss, and the greatest thing that this band did in the first decade of the new millennium will remain the seminal live album that was put together in 2005 during the all too brief reunion with Joey Belladonna. But following the passing of metal legend Ronnie James Dio, this band finally decided to bury the hatchet with Belladonna and along came a solid yet somewhat inconsistent return to form in Worship Music, an album that was preceded by an extremely tight and together throwback to the 80s in \"Fight Em' Till You Can't\" that renewed my long forgotten faith in Scott Ian and company.\n\nIn a similar respect, Evil Twin is the high powered single that will hopefully precede an even better and more consistently thrashing album in For All Kings, which will hit the market in a couple short months. This is grade A, high octane thrashing with a straightforward yet crushing riff set as only Scott Ian could deliver, and closely resembles the punchy character of Among The Living with a slight helping of the more measured and grooving character of Persistence Of Time, particularly during the stop and start approach of the verse riff. The vocal work generally sits on an upper-mid range tuneful yell that was this band's signature throughout the later 80s, though occasionally jumps down into lower territory and has a slight modern quirk to it. The recent recruiting of Shadows Fall shredder Jonathan Donais proves to complement the band about as well as Megadeth has been since taking on Angra's Kiko Loureiro as lead guitarist, as Donais puts forth a memorable solo that is largely indicative of Dan Spitz's classic sound, but with a bit more bite and a slight bit busier, definitely a step up from what Rob Caggiano brought to the band.\n\nIt might be a tad bit premature to say that Anthrax has completely cast off all the flaws of their past following the dismissal of Joey Belladonna soon after the dawn of the 1990s, but if the rest of the upcoming album sticks to and expands upon the formula at play here, it will be a complete certainty. With the sad slump that Slayer has found themselves in of late and the continued refusal of Metallica to get back to what works, Anthrax and Megadeth may have to be considered the Big Two of thrash metal, or we could perhaps keep it a group of four and simply place Overkill and Exodus into the fold to better reflect the current significance of the earlier prime movers of the style. If thrash metal holds any degree of significance for those of you reading this, get over to the nearest streaming site and check this song out, and join me in hoping for a whole album of this.\n",
        "\nAnthrax's first album holds an unusual place in the band's discography, owing to the sound, production, and the distinctive vocal performance. It is simple and amateur in every regard, and is often shelved by fans in favour of their later, more complex works that define the signature Anthrax sound. However, this is far from a generic throwaway, and is in fact a pioneering album of the thrash movement.\n\nThe sound featured is not pure thrash metal, instead featuring heavy doses of speed metal from the likes of Judas Priest's albums Screaming For Vengeance and Defenders Of The Faith, or Raven's first 3 albums. There are some more mid-tempo tracks on here that take from other members of the NWOBHM, most notably... you guessed it, Iron Maiden. The result of this heavy British influence, combined with increased muscle that was inspired from label mate Metallica and Metal Blade's Slayer, is a beefed up version of a characteristically 80's heavy metal sound, which proves to be part of this album's charm. It is one of the few instances where sounding dated works in the album's favour.\n\nDespite the NWOBHM leanings, this sound almost nothing like their similarly 80's sounding follow-up Spreading the Disease, on account of two things, one of which is the production. It is a rather unbalanced mix that heavily focuses on the low end of the album. Sometimes the bass guitar and the drums drown out the guitars and vocals, which are relegated to fight for 3rd. They aren't inaudible however, and this odd mix actually made this the heaviest album in Anthrax's discography until their 1990 masterpiece Persistence of Time. Some songs on here, dare I say it, are heavier than what was presented on the masterful debut of Slayer. Yes, there was a time when Anthrax could be heavier than Slayer. Sadly, they were not as aggressive. No matter how crushing this mix is, the guitars sound quite soft, but they aren't warm or fuzzy, let alone muddy. They just lack the bite that contemporary thrash pioneers Metallica and Slayer had.\n\nThe other reason for this album being so distinctive and different to their 1985 sophomore effort is the insane vocal work of Neil Turbin. His voice can be described as a ludicrous, flamboyant caricature of the NWOBHM vocal style, which entails wailing, screaming and gritty mid-range work. That description sounds bad, but it isn't. His screams are some the most remarkable in the genre, his wails surpass even Joey Belladonna in power and duration, and as 'Subjugator' proves, he is capable of some menacing mid-range vocals too. Sadly the rest of the band can't match this level of distinctiveness. Dan Lilker holds a favourable position here, what with the mix, and provides an extremely prominent and powerful low end. Charlie shows some signs of what he would become, with smatterings of double bass and fills here and there, but is mostly keeping time. Dan Spitz rips some excellent speed metal solos; see the ones on 'Panic' and 'Howling Furies' for evidence of that. Scott Ian writes some fairly aggressive, though very NWOBHM sounding, riffs on here. This album doesn't have quite so many of those as the songs are short. What little there is though rivals most of the riffs featured on other speed and thrash metal albums of the day.\n\nThe songwriting is nothing amazing, mostly simple and short songs that never progress too much. But they are certainly driven and passionate, never getting repetitious or dull. The sole exception is 'Death From Above', which is too long for its own good, and 'Soldiers of Metal' is a tad clich\u00e9 and uninspired. They aren't terrible though, and are still enough to make one headbang and air guitar. Also, who can forget the chorus of the former (Jet Fighter! Jet Fighter!) or the ending shriek of the latter? Some very thrash orientated songs are found here, such as 'Deathrider', 'Metal Thrashing Mad' and 'Howling Furies', which are the highlights of the album. Others, like 'Subjugator' and 'Panic' represent the sound of Overkill's debut a bit more, teetering on thrash while still being heavily rooted in the traditions of old.\n\nThis is one of weaker albums of Anthrax's 80's discography, but that is more of a statement of this band's progression throughout the decade. It also isn't saying much, given the quality of what would follow. It isn't thrash in the purest sense, and those that prefer the sound seen on the debuts of Metallica, Megadeth or Overkill are advised not to pick this album up unless you are getting it only due to its historical value. Fans of Spreading the Disease, Slayer's debut or the more aggressive songs of Judas Priest or Raven are encouraged to pick this up regardless.\n",
        "\nThis album is almost as forgotten as Anthrax's preceding release, State Of Euphoria. While regarded by metal fans as Anthrax's peak, this is often shelved by the mainstream in favour of 1987's Among the Living. Given the sound on here, this is rather confusing. However, a somewhat radical aesthetic shift makes this album's neglected status a bit more understandable.\n\nThe sound on display is very much thrash metal, akin to the previous 2 albums, but they are not one and the same. The songs here are considerably slower, even more so than State Of Euphoria. They are notably heavier and far more crushing in nature, and have been lengthened by a large amount. Though Among The Living and State Of Euphoria both feature one song that is longer than any single track here, the average song length is higher. The result is a much heavier, slower and more epic extension to the State Of Euphoria sound, which in turn was a heavier, slower and more epic extension to the Among The Living sound. Think of it as Anthrax's ...And Justice For All.\n\nThe result is an album which is very far removed from the light of heart sound featured previously featured. The production, unlike the aforementioned Metallica album, is a very full and heavy sound, with an extremely prominent bass. This in fact, one of the heaviest albums I have ever heard outside of doom metal or derived genres. The low end of the album is even more pronounced than before, which makes the thrashers on this album some of the most powerful Anthrax will ever write. The longer tracks, such as the first 4 tracks, become some of the most epic pure thrash songs of all time, giving them an extreme presence. Try leaving this album on in the background- you will stop what you are doing after 2 minutes and listen.\n\nAnd what you will find is 5 musicians in top form. Scott Ian writes some incredible riffs for this album, meaning the long mid-tempo songs never get boring (looking at you, Time Does Not Heal!). These are helped by a properly meaty and loud guitar tone, which gives these riffs an incredible amount of force behind them. Dan Spitz has always played a secondary role in Anthrax, as solos were never the thing anyone cared about when listening to Anthrax. However, he is very talented, and delivers yet more melodic genius. The finest examples would be the solos found during 'In My World' and 'Time'. Meanwhile, I don't know what was biting Charlie at the time, but he seems quite incredibly pissed off here. He delivers a very, very forceful performance, throwing in many, many technically accomplished fills and tasteful use of extended double bass on this album. Frank Bello continues to provide a strong low end, but mostly follows the guitars, save for the Joe Jackson cover, where he throws in a nice little bass solo. Joey sounds rather annoyed here too, probably not helped by the rising tensions between him and the rest of the band. His voice is just as melodic and powerful as usual, but at the same he time sticks to a lower register and doesn't pull off any extended wails. His voice is also dirtier and rougher than usual, though not enough to be unrecognisable. He doesn't quite fit in with the more serious and heavier, less melodic sound, but he still does a good job.\n\nAnd the result of their efforts is a usual blend of longer, drawn out, heavier and more epic songs and shorter thrashers. Most of the faster songs are still notably long and slow, save for the Joe Jackson cover. No song ever gets dull, whether it be the 8 minute 'Intro to Reality/Belly of the Beast' combo or the 4 towering monoliths at the beginning of the album. Possibly the only exception is 'H8 Red'. While far from terrible, it is a bit too slow and dull, and never really progresses. But this can't be said of any other song here, and for a(n) eleven/twelve track album, that is a good track record.\n\nOne thing to note, and the main reason several Anthrax fans reject this record, is the marked aesthetic shift on this album. In addition to heavier, slower and more crushing songs, the lyrics have changed drastically. Serious topics have been dealt with by Anthrax in the past ('The Enemy', 'One World', and 'Who Cares Wins') but they never presented themselves like this. One of the most biting examples is the opening lyrics to 'In My World:\n\n\n'I'll bite the hand that feeds me\nAnd I could give a damn if that hand needs me\nWhy can't you leave me alone?\nA lie may fool someone else\nBut it tells you the truth\nYou're weak, just another clone'\n\n\nNever has Anthrax penned such powerful and violent lyrics. They aren't violent in the way Slayer's lyrics were at the time, but they are shouted forth with such conviction that you have to take them seriously. You don't sing along, you listen and think. This can prove to be off putting for some, including me. I used to hate this album for being 'dull and overlong'. It is a bit of a slow grower, but eventually a prospective listener starts to realise the true nature of this album. It is intense, ferocious, nihilistic and cathartic. One look at that excellent cover art pretty much sums it up.\n\nThis is the absolute peak of Anthrax, and one of the greatest thrash metal albums of all time. Nothing at the time was so crushing, so aggressive, so incredibly powerful and intense as this album. Even the unholy trinity of 1986 could never leave such a lasting impression as this album did, and continues to do for just shy of 25 years now. The only thing a listener could miss is the sing-along factor that Anthrax albums generally have, but there is even a bit of that with the Joe Jackson cover of 'Got the Time'. Sure, 'H8 Red' is a bit weak, but it is still excellent, and the other near perfect 10 tracks surrounding it make up for it. I absolutely recommend this to fans of Anthrax, especially their 80's material. However, I also recommend this to those that hate the upbeat side of this band, for there is little of that here.\n",
        "\nI'd be willing to bet that when I first saw the case and liner notes for this CD, I made a weird face. The track listing was diverse and showed just how eclectic the band was at this point in their career. I was both skeptical and excited. After listening to the whole thing a few times I thought that this EP was genius. I remember laughing till I cried over the anti-PMRC song \"Startin' Up a Posse,\" and just thinking that the whole album was fantastic. There wasn't quite enough pure Anthrax songs, but other than that there weren't that many problems. \n\nOne thing that I really enjoyed here was the revamped version of \"I'm the Man.\" With the newer 1991 lyrics added to it, along with better production, I really liked it. I'm not a huge rap fan, but this song is just too good. So was the Public Enemy and Anthrax collaboration \"Bring the Noise,\" that features Scott Ian doing some rapping and holding his own with rap legend Chuck D. If anything is going to make this EP polarizing, it's this \"rapcore-like\" duo that garners a lot of attention. \n\nThe mix of music in Attack of the Killer B's was perfect. The fact that a Discharged cover and the song \"Pipeline\" can be on the same record and still work is very cool. However, neither of these songs was my favorite cover. Being a Kiss fan, when I saw \"Parasite\" listed here I knew I was in for a treat. I loved the way Charlie Benante played the drum part of the song. The song seemed more frantic compared to its original, but that's what I love about Anthrax. They always add their edge to everything they play. Belladonna and Co. really knew what they were doing here. \n\nThere was one song that did not work for me: \"The Belly of the Beast.\" Sure, it was a live version, but the live recording wasn't too good. The overall sound seemed washed out and muddy. \"Keep It In the Family\" wasn't too nice either. Had those two songs been taken out, I would be giving this a higher rating, but who cares about that? Attack of the Killer B's production as a whole was hard to rate, mainly because each song was so different. However most songs had a decent production quality and the tone of each instrument was crisp and clear. Even the bass sound was nice. \n\nThis album was a transitional album of sorts and it shows. As Anthrax moved into Island Records, and was evolving musically. Unlike previous records such as Among the Living, State of Euphoria, and especially Spreading the Disease, the band seem to be slowing down both literally and figuratively. This album sounds like something that was more than nine years in the making. Attack of the Killer B's sounds like something that has been pieced together bit by bit over more than just a decade, but at least twenty years. It's a culmination of Anthrax's talent, and it deserves to be listened to. So give it a shot. I think you will like it. Just don't let \"Startin' Up a Posse\" play out loud at your work. Trust me.\n",
        "\nThe year was 1988 and Anthrax had just released Among the Living, arguably their best album. But lest we not forget the great album that came soon after: State of Euphoria. It's a collection of riff after riff, vocals to rival many other Anthrax releases, and some frantic drumming that commands attention. Despite its somewhat iffy production and monotonous subjects, Anthrax proves that they can follow up any album they produce while still making music that can stand on its own. \n\nThe vocals of Joey Belladonna always seem to be getting better on each release that sings on, and State of Euphoria is no exception. There seemed to be a more sensitive nature to his mighty voice here, but I liked this. It fits in with the many personal subjects that get discussed on this record. The rest of the band seemed to be much tighter and in sync. Charlie Benante was the stand out musician on this album. He just continued to amaze here, with a more methodical approach to his blistering drumming. \n\nThe whole band however, was beginning to make a drastic change to their sound and songs as a whole. The songs were starting to become longer and less frantic. At the time, that was unusual for Anthrax. The lyrical subjects in State of Euphoria were also about personal issues. Belladonna seems to singing to an invisible person, considering that eight of these ten songs' lyrics are all written in the third person. It's as if the songs here were like a therapy session for him. This was one of the odd things on this album that will always stand out to me. \n\nMy favorite song here was \"Misery Loves Company.\" The catchy hooks in the chorus are so much fun to play along to or simply mosh to. The solo was ripping and the riffs were innovative. It's a wonderful musical version of the book Misery by Stephen King. Other highlights were \"Be All, End All\" with its haunting cello intro and \"Make Me Laugh.\" The latter of these two has some of Dan Spitz's most soulful playing I have heard in any Anthrax album. \n\nThere are a few filler songs on this album, and this just put a huge damper in the great vibe that I was getting from State of Euphoria. \"Schism\" along with \"Now It's Dark\" and \"Who Cares Wins\" didn't show many redeeming qualities in terms of riffs, melodies, and licks. The lyrics were okay, but the songs themselves did not work for me at all. They tended to drag along and leave very little pleasing musical substance. \n\nI think that this album would have been a ridiculously good EP if all of the fluff was trimmed off of it, but I guess that Anthrax thought different. But errors must be made to ensure the success of future works and State of Euphoria is not an exception to this. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to some B level thrash metal. For those of you looking to complete your Anthrax discography, this is a must. But if you don't feel like doing the above, then don't worry. This album isn't mandatory.\n",
        "\nThis album is easily the most forgotten of the Belladonna years of Anthrax, and one of their most forgotten albums in general. I find this very puzzling, given the nature of this album in respect to the much more well received 1987 blockbuster, Among The Living.\n\nOne of this release's main strengths is its production job. Whereas Among The Living sounds quite flat, this has a very pronounced low end, most notable with Benante's bass drums during the faster sections. However, it still retains a higher end to the sound, much like the previous effort. This has the effect of a better balance between all the instruments, as opposed to having the drums dominate everything. Faster tracks like 'Make Me Laugh', 'Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind' and closing thrasher 'Finale' all have their intensity levels accentuated as a result. Similarly, slower tracks like the incredible opener 'Be All, End All' and 'Who Cares Wins' take on an epic feel, much akin to what would be heard on their 1990 follow-up.\n\nAnother key strength to this album is that all artists involved are on form. Though the band has stated that they wished they could have spent more time on this album, I reckon they spent enough time. Belladonna gives his finest performance since Spreading the Disease, the main reason for this being the NWOBHM leanings of both that and this album. His vocals never worked too well on Among The Living as his voice is not suited to high intensity hardcore thrashing. Scott Ian produces doesn't produce quite as many riffs here as he did with their 1987 effort, but the riffs he does make are far more memorable and quite a bit more melodic, helping to fit in with Belladonna's voice. Frank Bello doesn't do much with the bass, but then these guys never played funk music. He does what he has always been doing (when you could hear him, that is), which is providing a much needed low end to the album's sound. Similarly, Dan Spitz pulls out some very melodic but quite modes solos, but Anthrax are not about solos in the way Slayer or old Testament are. Benante mixes it up between simple rock beats and intense double bass passages, complete with several fills thrown in like nobody's business, though not quite the fill-happy sound he would achieve on Persistence Of Time two years later.\n\nEven so, how the band members perform is one thing. How the songs turn out is quite another. Fortunately, Anthrax delivers with the number of classic tracks that sadly never made it onto the live setlists. The Antisocial cover is the one every fan knows, but most will never be exposed to the greatness that is 'Be All, End All'. This is one of the 10 greatest Anthrax tracks ever. It sums up this band's main strengths, that being memorability, and measuring out each aspect of a song perfectly. That main riff is among the most memorable in their discography, second only to 'Medusa'. The chorus is incredibly catchy, the solo is one of sheer melodic inspiration... it all fits together perfectly into one six and a half minute anthem. This applies to a lot of other tracks on the album, where everything just fits together perfectly. Some may have weaker choruses than others (SCHIIIIIIIISM! SCHISM, SC-SC-SC-SCHISM!) and there will always be '13', but those are small faults, really.\n\nI think the main reason this album would be forgotten is that it functions as a bridge between Among the Living and Persistence Of Time. To some, it is too slow to replace the former, while not quite living up to the incredibly gloomy and angry lyrics and atmosphere of the latter. However, I feel that this album is the best compromise between the two styles, not sacrificing the fun of listening to Anthrax that was lost on the latter, while building upon the established thrash sound of the former. This shouldn't put you off either of those two aforementioned albums however, those are essential to anyone calling themselves an Anthrax fan.\n\nWhile this isn't the culmination of their thrash sound, that being the follow-up, this is a swansong for Anthrax is one essential way: this is the last time their music is fun. Persistence of Time is even better musically, extending their epic thrash sound to its logical conclusion, but at no point do you want to sing along. This album embodies the spirit of the band, one of the most distinctive sounds in the thrash scene. I wholeheartedly recommend this to any fan of Anthrax, particularly their 80's material.\n",
        "\n\"Disease! Disease! Spreading the disease!\" The opening lines of Anthrax' third studio full length record aren't only a reference to the vivid predecessor, they also indicate the addicting strength of this thrash metal milestone. On its third output, the band has finally found its very own style. The East Coast quintet has moved away from its original New Wave of British Heavy Metal sound, several classic rock influences and even most of their hardcore punk touch inspirations. \"Among the Living\" is the band's rawest, fastest and angriest release and it defines the thrash metal genre better than any other album ever done. \n\nOver the next fifty minutes, Anthrax is offering nine pitiless tracks filled with fast riffs and unchained guitar solos, angrily pumping bass guitar licks, ferocious yet versatile high-speed drumming and breathless yet powerful vocals that are emotionally over the top but manage to remain catchy and melodic as they are constantly supported by energizing and angry gang shouts. The lyrics vary between angry yet intelligent social criticism and unchained fun anthems inspired by popular culture. The more serious lyrics are related to contemporary issues back in the days such as the outrageous fate of Native Americans, an ongoing Cold War despite a desire for peace and unity from younger generations and a warning that the horrors of war shouldn't be downplayed, forgotten or neglected. The more carefree texts feature ironic statements about complicated interpersonal relationships, unbound lust for life or are simply inspired by fictitious characters from different art media such as Judge Dredd, Randall Flagg or Reverend Henry Kane. Lyrically, this release is an incredibly authentic time document from the mid-eighties but I can still relate to most of the texts three decades later due to their timeless and youthful spirit.\n\nThis mixture of mature and juvenile lyrics would become a trademark for the band that was also a guiding line for the next three studio albums. Even though the band found its own musical style on this release, the quintet opted for less urgent variations of that style on the next three records. Anthrax have never been that poignant again as on \"Among the Living\". Some of their other albums might be more courageous, diversified or intellectual but this release is probably their best due to its emotions, energy and honesty. In my opinion, this is the best thrash metal album of all times.\n\nApart of one or two less intense minutes in \"A.D.I. / Horror of It All\" that sounds alien to this release due to its calmer and sluggish approach and an almost epic length of nearly eight minutes, every track on here is an instant hit and still relevant almost thirty years later. Just like a disease, this album makes you sing along, raise your fists in the air and get crazy in a mosh pit. If you want to see what this kind of music can do to an adrenalized crowd, go watch the first thirty minutes of the incredible live release \"Chile on Hell\" where the band plays the five opening tracks of this milestone in a row more than twenty-six years later. From the first epic and melodic seconds of the atmospheric, pace-shifting and pitiless opener \"Among the Living\" to the angry message against media creation of plastic people in the album closer \"Imitation of Life\" that ends this milestone with heavy and low bass play, brutal mid-tempo riffs and some dystopian distortion, the intensity of this album is indeed spreading like a disease. If you like metal music, no matter what genre might be your favourite, this is an absolutely essential record to add to your collection or to quote singer Joey Belladonna: \"Among the living - follow me or die!\"\n",
        "\nThis album was hyped by the label and stated by the music critics to be a 'return to form' for Anthrax, a return to the melodic, wonderful style with comical lyrics, flying vocals and a solid rhythm section. This couldn't be further from the truth; it is merely a continuation of what the band have been doing with vocalist John Bush since 1993, with Sound of White Noise. However, rather than tastefully incorporating the grunge-tinged grooves of that album, the outright groove metal of Volume 8, or not so tastefully incorporating the generic hard rock of Stomp, they have added in some modern (for the time) nu 'metal' garbage.\n\nUpon getting past the pretty cool, if not essential, intro 'Contact' this album once again roars in with the strong opener 'What Doesn't Die'. It brings to mind 'Potters Field' with the high speed pounding from Charlie. The song thrashes along very well, with some solid and aggressive riffs, and despite a solo that sounds like a slightly worse version of Dimebag Darrell, this is most certainly a highlight, not just of Bush-fronted Anthrax, but of their discography as a whole.\n\nBut then, well, it all falls apart from here. 'Superhero', 'Strap It On' and especially 'Taking the Music Back' are a few examples of the bulk of this album's material. They are about as close to the nu as Anthrax have gotten (at the time of writing this- given the past this lineup could break up any day). They all have sizable sections that are based upon vocals with mute, chugging guitars, with a worrying return to a rapped vocal style in some places, that puts me in mind of Stomp 442 That weird guitar noise floating upon an entirely generic chug riff in 'Superhero', this does not sound good at all, far too much like Korn, as well as being very grating on its own. Let\u2019s not talk about the 'jumpdafuckup' section of 'Strap It On', either. 'Taking The Music Back' was made specifically for the radio and MTV play; it features really dumb guitar parts and lyrics pandering to the crowds. This song puts me in mind of 'Nothing' from 1995, only a bit less catchy. Radio oriented songs like these are not inherently awful ('Only' and 'Black Lodge' were excellent singles, for instance) but this is just bad. It is unintelligent and very cheesy, even for this album. 'Nobody Knows Anything' and especially 'Cadillac Rock Box' sound like an alternative tinged Volume 8. However, a lack of Dimebag Darrell, the guitar tone, and the vocal performance of most alt rock bands of time, prevent this from sounding like the better moments of said preceding album. However, they do at least sound a bit like Anthrax, and refrain from the Korn staples for their runtimes. The former in particular is oddly appealing, being a light, air-headed rocker, like a less aggressive 'Fueled' from Stomp. Though not quite as good as 'What Doesn't Die', and still not good by Bush era standards, it is at least listenable. The whole stop - start nonsense in the former song's riffs and the effect in the background is a bit irritating, especially since said riff is decent, but these tracks are better than the nu 'metal' songs overall, for featuring actual riffs, a lack of a grating rapped vocal style, and not coughing up some awful guitar effects or other ideas from the 'modern' bag.\n\nThis leaves the few stylistic outliers. 'Crash' is a pointless one minute interlude, trying to serving the same roles as 'Contact' by being atmospheric, an interlude and filler all in one. However, fails all of these; being not very atmospheric, and too short to effectively pad out the running time or serve as a rest stop. Also, and I hate to parrot on about this, but this is far too nu 'metal': very reminiscent of the likes of 'The Burning Red's' title track by Machine Head, but not quite as ridiculous. A vocal performance that is drenched in effects and no real instruments to be heard. 'Safe Home' is a radio ballad in the vein of 'Black Lodge', 'Bare' or 'Pieces'. While the song is cheesy, it manages to be more powerful than 'Bare', as well as not merging into a 'groove rock' song later on. However, it never rekindles the magic seen in 'Pieces' or 'Black Lodge' though, by a long shot. Sounds way too much like certain alt radio rock bands that polluted the airwaves in the late \u201890s and were still trendy at this point, and thus fail to have any emotional effects upon the listener, other than severe cringing or outright laughter from the corniness.\n\n'Black Dahlia' was quite a surprise to be honest. It\u2019s a very short song that features a really driven verse section and a very intense interlude. The chorus is non-grating, and catchy too, the former being a rarity for this album's pansy sounding nu styled choruses. The blasting and tremolo riffing is a nice touch too, but this certainly isn't the 'death metal' song people claimed it to be, even if it does transport you away from the awfulness of this album. It is still great nonetheless, a highlight of the Bush era and Anthrax in general.\n\nWell, that just leaves the production really. It kind of sounds like how not to fix the issues with Sound of White Noise's production. The guitars sound about as muddy as said album, but of a deeper nature, and doesn't give this 90's feel I always harp on about. The drums, though very heavy, are too damn high in the mix, meaning moments like 'What Doesn't Die' or 'Black Dahlia' are drowned out by the thundering skins. As stated earlier, many of these songs have overly loud vocals that drown out the guitars too, when the drums aren't doing the same. This is probably the worst production job of any Bush era album, as it really grates on the ears at times. This might actually be worse than the production of their debut 'Fistful of Metal', and that is saying something.\n\nAnd that is that really; upon the closing of the unbearably dull and nu title track, with its alternating quiet verses and loud climactic choruses (that aren't climactic at all), that is Anthrax's return to form. Two great songs and one other decent rocker is an appalling hit rate in album with 12 full length songs. This is not a return to form, and actually strays further from metal than before. While this is more captivating than Stomp 442, not sounding as forced, 'samey' and at least with some true highlights, this is still one of Anthrax's worst. For those who enjoy the likes of Volume 8 and to a lesser extent, White Noise, just download 'Black Dahlia', 'What Doesn't Die' and maybe 'Cadillac Rock Box'. Else, stay the hell away.\n\nThe cover art is quite something surreal; it shows people going along with what these guys play on here!\n",
        "\nThe circus of trends that is Anthrax's John Bush-fronted era continues with this waste of plastic. On the one hand they do actually manage to write a few promising if flawed tracks and even a genuinely good song, which is a massive step up from Stomp 442 which had two pretty decent songs surrounded by garbage. On the other hand this album is more stylistically confused than anything else in their catalogue; while this does lead to a bit more variation it throws off any semblance of consistency and flow as they jump between a style they can pull off and other styles that they can't.\n\nUnlike the two albums before it there are actually 3 styles of music at work here: groove metal that draws very heavily from Pantera, a return to the heavy, muddy alternative rock that was present in spades on Stomp and Sound of White Noise and a few unfunny joke songs along the way. The first of these is by far the strongest - it isn't clear who's writing the riffs this time round (Charlie did so on the last album) but whoever did can write much stronger material than what was present on that release. The riffs and solos still aren't good but they're at least functional, and still far above the dregs of the genre, i.e. Machine Head. Dimebag once again plays lead on a couple of songs here ('Inside Out' and 'Born Again Idiot'), and puts on a good show as ever. As for the rock songs, the guitar tone helps them along a little but songs like 'Catharsis' or 'Piss'n'Vinegar' are made up of shallow and redundant chord strums and sloppy, dime-a-dozen grunge/alternative rock riffs that go nowhere. The songs are so generic and dull that they go in one ear and out the other and are completely unmemorable. The novelty songs are either short groovy throwaways like '604' that try to shoot for S.O.D.'s Speak English or Die but fall well short of even Bigger than the Devil or sappy, insincere acoustic nonsense like Anthrax's own 'Mama Said' in 'Toast to the Extras'. There's nothing else to be said about these songs as they have no musical substance or humour to them at all. The closing acoustic ballad 'Pieces' is about Frank Bello's dead brother and thus isn't really a novelty, and whilst there is some poignancy to the track it's still an overly long, flat and dull song that is a largely weak ending to the album.\n\nThere are also some general flaws of the album that need to be addressed: the first of which is John Bush's vocal performance. Admittedly he sounds less douche-y and more tuneful than on the last two albums, and doesn't try quite as hard to sound tough. That said he still sounds bad; most of his vocal melodies are flat and awkward and put the brakes on any momentum the instruments might generate. He still can't carry a tune all that well and his attempts at aggression are still weak. I think the real problem though is that like before he has no memorable identity of his own, and prefers to be a third-rate imitation of more popular rock and metal vocalists. On the less aggressive tracks for example he still comes across like a poor man's Scott Weiland, while on the more aggressive tracks he sounds like a bad rock singer trying to do metal.\n\nThe second general flaw is that the songwriting is lacklustre - as ever, the band has a tendency to repeat riffs too much and nothing in the way of a bridge or contrasting section is attempted as a general rule. Riffs are run into the ground and in doing so songs with a lot of promise like the aptly-titled 'Crush' have their momentum run into the ground. The less than stellar tracks such as 'Catharsis' or 'Toast to the Extras' are even harder hit as they never had any good ideas to begin with, so their bad ideas get repeated ad infinitum. This is a bigger problem than it may seem; it turns this hour long, 15 track album into a tedious slog that becomes unbearably dull and uninteresting as it wears on and on. Only the aforementioned 'Inside Out' really manages not to overstay its welcome: the vocals are tolerable if unremarkable, it doesn't repeat itself too much as it cycles between some solid groove riffs and dark acoustic work, and has a good solo from Dimebag to boot.\n\nHad they stuck to the groove metal or even alternative rock styles and wrote about 8 songs instead of 15 this could have simply been below average or kind of bad as opposed to really awful and tiresome. This thing is too long and too inconsistent to ever get going in any sense, and the lazy writing further compounds that. As ever, don't bother seeking this out; if you want the only good thing about it go and download 'Inside Out' and let the rest rot, along with nearly everything else Anthrax was doing around this time. It would make more sense to listen to Pantera instead.\n",
        "\nEven though Sound of White Noise saw Anthrax totally fall flat as they tried to hop on the grunge trend, they managed to fall even harder with their second stab at rock music. The stupid cover art and lame album title should give a good indication of what level we're on here - this tedious, dated and awkward music that sounded bad in the '90s and hasn't aged well at all. There are almost no redeeming qualities to this album at all, with even fewer good tracks and even less effort put into it than before. Barring the likes of The Least Successful Human Cannonball and Out for Blood I can't think of an album this bad that was released by a great thrash band.\n\nThe grunge tendencies of the last album have been ditched, giving way to a really, *really* bad take on a hard/alternative rock and groove metal hybrid. The band attempt to don a Pantera-like 'tough guy' attitude with the songs here, leading to an emphasis on chugging and simplistic, hard hitting grooves but it doesn't work, largely because Charlie Benante is no Dimebag Darrell when it comes to writing memorable, pugilistic groove riffs. The music is about as bland and redundant as can be, with the every last song consisting of turgid stop-start groovy riffs that are forgotten as soon as they leave, while Charlie and Frank play equally repetitive parts on their respective instruments. They occasionally pull it out of the bag with the music: 'Fueled' and 'In A Zone' clearly stand out as having a decent amount of thought put into their composition compared to the rest of the rubbish on here, moving along at a decent clip and having solid riffing to boot. Another relative positive is that the multiple lead guitarists on this album (Paul Crook, Charlie and the aforementioned Dimebag Darrell) put on a solid show on the soloing front.\n\nThe biggest issue with this album is that apart from throwing in some high-end noise from the guitars on songs like 'Riding Shotgun' there is no real way to tell apart most of the songs from each other. The closer 'Bare' amounts to a half ballad, with the second half being taken up by yet more awful grooving, and 'Nothing' throws that sound away entirely in favour of some dreadful buttrock nonsense that manages to be even less aggressive or energetic and even more dated than everything else here. Apart from these outliers however every last song sounds almost exactly the same, with the band rehashing the same boring verse-chorus structures and finding different ways to arrange the same 4 notes into more same-y ho-hum groove riffs. Songs are uniform in tempo (not quite mid-tempo but not brisk either) and never throw any surprises on that front, or indeed any way at all. They all ride one or two of those terrible riffs into the ground, with only 'In A Zone' managing to keep things vaguely interesting by changing up enough between sections and having some decent riffs. Other than this however it's all 'in one ear, out the other' garbage.\n\nThe vocals are pretty awful too, as John Bush has decided to throw in a pseudo-rapping cadence to some of his work ('Random Acts of Senseless Violence') and throw out most of the tune and melody from his singing, perhaps the closest comparison I could give is that he sounds like a weak Scott Weiland. He couldn't sound aggressive or sing in tune if his life depended on it, and it makes the album even worse than it otherwise would have been; even if you like this sort of music there is no way to enjoy this album with these vocals all over it. This is easily Anthrax's worst album, and makes other failures like St. Anger seem positively wonderful in comparison. For everyone's sake don't buy this or seek it out in any way, shape or form; it's a dreadful album that deserves to be derided and forgotten.\n",
        "\nSound of White Noise is a classic example of what happened to so many fantastic '80s metal bands by start of the '90s - they lost all of their identity and were swallowed into the corporate machinery of commercial rock. Some bands managed a weakened but still decent effort that signalled their entry into the decade, but others fell completely flat, and few bands fell harder than Anthrax. Their work from the era was marked by the perpetual stench of mediocrity as they traded in any and all artistic principle in the name of monetary gain. While this particular album isn't quite as awful as what would follow it is still a weak effort, either when viewed as an individual piece or when compared to other albums of its type from the period.\n\nBy far the most baffling thing about this album is its sound; it is for all intents and purposes a grunge album. The biggest influence on the guitar work is Stone Temple Pilots, whose muddy guitar tone and hard rock tendencies have had a profound influence on this album's riffs, particularly the highly simplistic numbers such as 'Hy Pro Glo' or '1000 Points of Hate'. There are also a few nods to Alice in Chains, or at least some attempts to interpret grunge through a heavy metal lens, which leads to the slower, more doom-infused numbers such as 'This Is Not an Exit'. In spite of the overt grunge/alt rock tendencies of the album however it still carries a strong influence from Pantera and perhaps even Helmet, which takes the form of very simplistic and repetitious groove metal riffing that occasionally arises between the more rock influenced riffs.\n\nIn spite of the simplification from previous efforts the band were drawing from good influences - the problem is simply that the riffs are woefully uninspired. The music is very generic, and it isn't even a very remarkable or interesting take on the standard grunge template. It's what happens when a band suddenly changes style after developing a previous sound, where they don't do enough to put their own spin on an established set of tropes because the style wasn't their own to begin with. This shows, as virtually none of the riffing on this album is particularly memorable or inspiring. The more metallic moments see the band return to something a little more familiar and hence they pull it off better but for the most part the band don't really do a whole lot to develop the sounds or ideas they employ, being quite content to play a dull and unmemorable groove/grunge hybrid. Sure the drumming can be a bit overactive and the lead work can actually be quite impressive - but for every aggressive drum pattern or excellent bit of shredding there's a boring straight beat or a dry, short solo, and good drumming or lead guitar work can't make up for lazy riffs.\n\nThis era of Anthrax's output coincided with John Bush's stint with the band, and his performance borders on being terrible, as well as disappointing given his work with Armored Saint. He spends most of his time badly copying tortured croons of Layne Staley, and he's also taken on a substantial gravelly rock inflection akin to Eddie Vedder and Scott Weiland. While there are worse vocalists he could have copied the same problem as the music applies here - he's not putting his own memorable spin on the style and instead reverts to a weak take on genre tropes. He can't really carry a tune and several of the vocal lines and hooks are flat and unmemorable, while others are tuneless and grating. He generally sounds bad in one way or another, especially when he tries yelling and simply sounds weak.\n\nThe structuring of the songs is incredibly flat and redundant. None of the progressive writing from the last two albums is present, as the band elect to stick to very basic verse-hook structures that never excite or interest. Riffs are run into the ground, ruining the energy of potentially decent songs such as 'Potters Field' or 'Room for One More' with their surprisingly solid main riffs. Songs don't vary in terms of energy or tempo, though there are a few faster sections such as the ending of 'This Is Not an Exit' or the entirety of 'Burst' - these tend to be the exception rather than the rule though, with most songs sticking to an upper mid-tempo and not doing enough to keep the listener interested in general. Overlong songs such as 'Packaged Rebellion' are incredibly dull; as the band doesn\u2019t have enough ideas to keep a 6 minute song interesting beyond a solo. As a result of these issues few winners emerge from this album - the main one is \u2018Only\u2019 with its simple but memorable melodies and catchy vocal lines, as well as its relatively aggressive verse riff. The laid back keyboard piece \u2018Black Lodge\u2019 is another highlight, largely due to the more inspired music and its flowing nature, as well as the fact that there is a discernible melody to John Bush\u2019s singing. \u2018Sodium Pentathol\u2019 and \u2018Burst\u2019 represent more aggressive groove metal infused takes on the grunge sound, with both moving along at a reasonable pace and staying short and to the point.\n\nHowever, 4 out of 11 is an incredibly poor hit rate regardless of the band, made even worse when you consider who is behind this. This is an incredibly uninspired, dull and in some cases downright bad effort from a band that were out of their depth. They didn\u2019t try to make it interesting, instead choosing to ride on the coattails of much better artists from the time in order to push more albums. The band would somehow get worse as they weathered the decade, and this is blatantly the start of that tragic decline. Needless to say, don't seek this out; its highlights aren't enough to make up for the rest of the album or what it represents for the band.\n",
        "\nThis one reminds me a lot of the older days when the band put out 'Persistence of Time' and 'State of Euphoria'. There still is that tint of thrash metal to the core of their sound, but now with more groove along with it. Joey still sounds the same on vocals and the guitars throw out some strong rhythms/leads. I'd say the blend of thrash/groove metal definitely does apply. Great album here, This one you can't really get tired of. The band has been around for so long and pretty much (for the most part) have the same line-up they've had for years. What's most striking here is the music and vocals. Joey sings great on here and the guitars have some awesome riffs! You have to hear it!\n\nDoes this album go along well the whole way through? My answer is yes, it never gets boring. What's different? The ingenuity in the songwriting flat-out, the musical compositions are strong on every song and that groove is thick, not just thrash metal. It's not a musically fast album though the leads are. They are quite technical, the leads that is. The main guitar riffs are solid, going on strong for every track. They mix exquisitely with the vocals as do the drums. It sounds like they tune down a little bit, making the music a little heavier then mix in that groove laden style in there. The bar chords and tremolo picked riffs are all quite well played and thought out. Very good songwriting! \n\nWhat's to be expected in the production quality is the fact that the guitars are well heard, vocals don't drown out the music, drums are well heard on here too, so overall a solid album sound-wise. Nothing really very wrong about how this album sounds production-quality speaking, I think it's really solid. The guitars hit home with me on here. They really did a good job at piecing everything together. You don't just hear groove guitar, you hear quality in some of its' thrash stricken style, but it isn't an album that's really overly aggressive. Now that they've turned on the groove to their sound, they've made their metal sound quote like that to the likes of Soulfly's 'Savages' release.\n\nTheir clean sounding music isn't for the whole of the album. It's just a part of their diversity. It really is an overall album that is something that any metalhead could get into because the music is so well pieced together. It fluctuates, but not in severity. It's really a mild metal album. Some darn good lead work as well! i think Joey sounds awesome as usual on here. His voice makes Anthrax unique in the metal community. It's what sets them aside from bands like Exodus, Slayer, Testament, et al. Even though their aggression isn't as prominent than is on their earlier days, they are still making quality metal. This one is probably one of their better ones in their discography.\n\nStill skeptical? Well you shouldn't be because 'Worship Music' hits home with each and every track. They dig deep in creativity and hit home with all outputs. Don't expect anything extremely fast or thrash laden. Even though the crunch tone on the guitar is still there, the intensity has backed down and they're playing more groove than thrash. The thrash elements are still apart of this album, but the music aims more at a groove to it. It really is diverse, but yeah, it is definitely one that's entirely likeable. If you haven't liked more recent Anthrax releases, this one you'd be surprised that you'll like and is well better than just an average metal release. These guys are still going on strong! They own!\n",
        "\nOverall this is great, but there certainly are some big questions here, so may as well get them on the table. First off, why the hell does Metallica get their own disc, and all three of the others have to share one? That doesn't seem like it should matter, until you find out that their setlist is way longer than the other bands. I get it, their the big guys, the popular ones, but come on man, they gotta all be even. Another thing, at the end when all four bands were out to play \"Am I Evil?\", why were there hardly any Slayer members out there? Granted, the others came out for the big picture at the end of it. Those are my only questions with the DVD as a whole, but note that for the rest of this, I will break it into one part for each band's performance.\n\nBeing chronological here, I will start with the performance of Anthrax. This one was probably actually my second least favorite of the four bands to play. I love Anthrax, but Joey Belladonna's voice just doesn't seem to do it for my live anymore or at least not as well. If this was made in the year 1989 or something along those lines, it would probably be pretty solid. His voice just seems to be out of range a lot and there's hardly any power there anymore. Thankfully the rest of the band does pretty well, but then again you usually don't lose instrument skills because of age, and that's all this really seems to be from. I like the setlist they picked, all of the songs on here are classics, however I probably would have replaced \"Only\" with something else. John Bush was not made for this band, and Joey singing his songs doesn't change anything. Scott Ian, I will say, seems to play just as well if not better than back in the heyday. Something that is evident in slowing down is \"Got The Time\". That's one of the fastest Anthrax songs that I know, but on here they could not quite keep up the pace anymore. No shame in that, they have had an incredible career and I am glad the boys were able to re-unite to do something like this. To sum it up though, I'd say it's good, but just not the same as what it could have been years ago. Granted I wasn't alive all of those years ago, but you get the point. My total scoring for this one would probably be 67%.\n\nMegadave, I mean, excuse me, Megadeth is next. Anymore the band lineup means nothing to me because it always seems to change. However Nick Menza on drums is the exception. He is the one drummer that is superior to the others. That means nothing since he is not on here. Regardless of that though, this was probably the best performance of the four bands. Dave Mustaine, although getting old and certainly showing age, does a pretty great job on this. His solos and playing techniques did not go down at all since the '80s, and even after his issue with his hand, he still kills it. Same goes for his vocals, if anything, they sound a little quieter, but I wouldn't say weaker. Hardly ever in metal is the bass ever that significant to me, simply because a lot of times I can't even hear it. David Ellefson is an exception, because his playing is very audible and sounds great on almost all of the tracks. Megadeth still has it in them for this performance. I also love how he takes one break in all of the songs. While the other bands stop and talk to the audience, he does that one time very briefly before the track \"Head Crusher\". And that's it! No more do you hear them stop and do anything like that. It just plays straight through til the end, with the Holy Wars Reprise that they seem to end every concert with. They did something similar when I saw Megadeth live in 2013 with Black Label Society, Device, Hellyeah!, and Newsted. Great performace, and overall get's an 89%.\n\nSLAYER! You'll hear that a lot at metal concerts in general. However I can't say at this one I would do the same. I was greatly disappointed by this performance, and would definitely say that this was the worst one. For years Slayer were great live performers, but like Anthrax I think the age is finally getting to them. Other live DVDs of theirs such as \"War At The Warfield\" or \"Live Intrusion\" are spectacular. But this one, definitely is a let down. I'd like to see Slayer soon so I can say I've seen them, before they completely die out. Anyways, Tom Araya has lost all sense of power in his voice. Take \"Angel Of Death\" and \"War Ensemble\". Both of those songs have long, loud, beastly screams. He either doesn't do them or does it very weakly in this. He also doesn't sound like he always has his breath for some parts, and overall just sounds weak. The rest of the band did pretty well, but that isn't enough to balance it out to me. Jeff Hannemen has always been my guitarist of choice for this band. His was pretty up to par, however Kerry King seems to only care about how mean he looks and the playing sounds a little slowed down. Then again, so does the whole band. It's the age, I'm telling you. Something else, I thought that the setlist was rather mediocre. There was too much new stuff and not enough classic. They played nothing from the first two albums, but then again, I'm not sure if they even could at this point. Yet they could do \"Chemical Warfare\", so I don't understand. Also, like I said, almost none of the guys joined at the end for the \"Am I Evil?\" performance. Come on guys, get off your asses and get out there. You're legendary! Slayer certainly went below their standards, and receive a 50%.\n\nLastly, the band absorbing the most fame, Metallica. Their performance was incredible too, almost as good as Megadeth's. Metallica have always seemed to be ageless when it comes to playing live. Sure, they aren't the long haired aggressive maniacs that we all know of and loved in the '80s, but they still certainly aren't bad. The only thing is, I don't really see why they get to play so much more just because they're more popular. Regardless, most of it was pretty good. James still sings his heart out, and gives off that vibe of just wanting to have fun. Lars is still a freak, not the best drummer, but still the same guy he always was. The instruments are top notch as always. Really, there's no disappointments on this. They probably could have cut out some of the newer stuff as well, much like Slayer needed to do. But they make up for it by at least doing everything well and having plenty of classics on here to balance it out. While most people get annoyed by bands that talk a lot, Metallica is fine by doing so. Like I said, James always wants to just put up a good show, so him talking to the audience a lot is not a problem at all. Something else that I never quite understood was why they always throw the tracks from \"Kill 'Em All\" at the very end. They did that here too. Perhaps they just like to close on an energetic note? Hey, at least they did a great job with it, like I said. Certainly nothing like it was but at least they can adapt their old stuff well. I give this one an 88%.\n\nIf you like all of the bands, I suggest getting this regardless of some of the flaws, just because it is something that every fan should see at least ones. It has it's good, bad, and ugly (definitely not talking about some of the band members at all there....). It's also good for background if you have people over and just want a concert on TV. Mostly good performances with some weak parts, that's all I've got to say.\n",
        "\n\"Young and free, something you'll never be!\". The first lines of Anthrax's sophomore output resume the band's spirit back in the days very well. The East Coast thrash metal legend performs carefree songs full of enthusiasm without any compromises. Stylistically, the band sounds still much closer to the New Wave of British Heavy Metal than to the pitiless thrash metal between liberatingly humorous lyrics and socially critical statements on later outputs. The cool main riff of \"Madhouse\" could be taken from a Judas Priest record of the early eighties while the harmonious guitar play and the high pitched chorus of \"S.S.C./Stand or Fall\" have obvious Iron Maiden influences. New singer Joey Belladonna offers his most enthusiastic performance and isn't afraid of high notes or fast passages. His technical struggles here and there are outpowered by his charming juvenile spirit. The tight rhythm section of bass guitar and drums harmonizes well and grooves, pushes and rushes us through nine vivid tracks. The guitar work is extraordinary as one can hear both tight heavy metal riffs and orgasmic melodic high-speed guitar solos in all tracks of this fun ride. \n\nDespite numerous influences from other bands, Anthrax always manages to add a surprising note to each song and keeps a high degree of original diversity without losing the carefree guiding line. Especially the opening moments of most tracks are courageous, entertaining and original. The humorous radioplay overture of the charismatic \"Madhouse\" reminds me of the thought provoking drama One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The acoustic guitar opening of \"S.S.C./Stand or Fall\" almost recalls traditional flamenco influences. The drum play and sound effects in the beginning of \"The Enemy\" make almost any metal fan play air drums and bang his head. The folk infused sounds in the beginning of \"Armed and Dangerous\" that are carried on by appeasing acoustic guitars and heartbreaking electric guitar solos are atmospheric and progressive but nevertheless related to classic heavy metal. This is one of the most melodic and also outthought tracks ever written by the band. On the other side, Anthrax closes the record with its fastest song ever which is the chaotic and humorous \"Gung Ho\" where all instruments break loose towards the intentionally random ending.\n\nThere are only two songs I enjoy a little bit less on an otherwise incredibly strong output somewhere between classic heavy metal, American power and thrash metal and a small dose of hardcore punk. \"Aftershock\" has some interesting lyrics and can be seen as a hint at more politically inspired texts to come from the band but the chorus lacks energy and originality and the usually emotional guitar solos on this record are missing on this tune. \"Medusa\" is slightly better because of a solid heavy metal main riff and a great melodic vocal performance in the verses but the slightly psychedelic and noisy chorus is rather off-putting and plain weird as it doesn't fit at all to the rest of the song. If these two tracks weren't on the record, it would maybe be the best American heavy and power metal album of all times. Despite these two average tunes, this album still is a classic must have for fans of the aforementioned genres.\n\nThere is only one thing left to talk about. I would like to know what happened to Mister Brown. The mentally disabled patient welcomes his medicine with hysterical laughter in the beginning of \"Madhouse\" and one can hear him again during the chaotic and liberating party that is going on during \"Gung Ho\". Maybe he was able to escape from the madhouse as one can hear him again in another crowd during the performance of \"Bud E Luv Bomb and Satan's Lounge Band\", a b-side of the band's third record. As far as I know, he was never heard of again after his appearance during this crazy concert with a couple of drunkards in a social club. What happened to Mister Brown? I hope this secret will get revealed one day and that we might hear of him again on Anthrax's next studio record.\n",
        "\nIn the interest of full disclosure, let me explain why I'm reviewing this album. To be honest, I have never really listened to Anthrax all that much; I don't know why, but as far as the \"Big 4\" thrash bands are concerned, I always found Anthrax the least interesting. I remember hearing \"Bring the Noise\" in the 90s and being kind of unimpressed: it didn't strike me as very good metal or rap. However, today I decided to fill in some of the gaps in my \"thrash education,\" and give Anthrax a listen. I figured I could start with Among the Living, widely acknowledged to be one of their classic albums. Instead, I decided on a whim to go in a different direction, and listen to one of their most reviled albums. And I'm glad I did, because I am actually enjoying the hell out of this record!\n\nI know, Volume 8-The Threat Is Real is not really thrash, strictly speaking. It's certainly not 80s thrash, and you know what? That's okay with me. 80s thrash is gone, and it's never coming back. Metallica isn't that young group of metalheads that recorded Ride the Lightning, and even the mighty Slayer aren't what they once were. And Megadeth hasn't really been great ever since Mustaine gave up on heroin... \n\nSo let's look at Volume 8 for what it IS, instead of what it is not. And what it is, as far as I'm concerned, is a very solid record with some varied musical influences that come from well outside the world of thrash. \"Crush,\" the opening track, with its tom-heavy drum sound grabbed my interest right away. There was a headlong momentum to the track that brought a smile to my face. It's really too bad that Anthrax would eventually part ways with John Bush, because his robust voice really brings a lot of depth to the band's sound that is missing from the records that feature Belladonna.\n\nI mentioned the drums above, and I'd like to spend a little more time on that subject. Even though I like Scott Ian, and I think he's an energetic guitarist with a lot of spunk, I don't think he's a great guitarist. Charlie Benante, though, really impresses me. He's not a one trick pony, like a lot of metal drummers. He can lay down a mellow groove (as he does on much of \"Inside Out\") or he can let it rip with thundering, up-tempo assaults (I think \"604\" is a good, albeit brief example).\n\nVolume 8 is not perfect, of course. \"Toast to the Extras\" is an incredibly lame, Aerosmith-flavored country rock track that is just silly. Even Metallica has mostly avoided sounding this twangy! And \"Cupajoe\" is a complete waste of time. Mercifully brief, it's sounds like one of those tongue twisters that theatre majors do to warm up their voices (as Jack Black does in the movie School of Rock: \"Lips, teeth, tip of the tongue\"). No doubt, many thrash fans hate the Poison-ish ballad \"Pieces.\" But c'mon, bassist Frankie Bello had just lost his brother, who was shot dead in New York. I am impressed by a musician who can turn pain into heartfelt music, even if that music falls outside of their usual purview. The big difference between something like \"Pieces\" is as great as the difference between losing a beloved family member and losing a stripper/girlfriend to another rock star. (Which was reportedly the inspiration for Poison's \"Every Rose Has its Thorn.\")\n\nVolume 8-The Threat Is Real is not going to be to every metal fan's liking. That much is obvious from reading many of the reviews of the record, here and elsewhere. But I try to judge every album on its own merits, as much as possible. And I found the album to be an enjoyable listen. Not a metal classic, but worth my time.\n",
        "\nWe, Anthrax fans, all know the long story behind the Worship Music album. The album which was finally released without Dan Nelson (thank god!) and without John Bush (I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve sounded great on at least half the songs) but with the returning Joey Belladonna!\n\nTo emphasize the sheer pleasure Anthrax are having to be working again with Joey, there is this little EP to make it all the more obvious to the fans. We have a song from Scott\u2019s favorites AC-DC but also a moment for Charlie to shine on a Rush cover. But to be honest, all the songs on Anthems in the first place show how diverse Joey can actually sing. He is the biggest revelation here. He makes all these songs work. He can do Bon Scott AND Geddy Lee. So what is YOUR argument for not liking Joey Belladonna?\n\n'Anthems' is an EP from an eighties metal band sounding like a seventies rock group. The band sticks to the originals. They don\u2019t make these songs sound too heavy or too metal. What we hear is a band covering songs by trying to come as close as they can to the original. Even \u2018Smokin\u2019 features a really superb keyboard solo. I am NOT going to describe all songs here. Saying the band chose to stay close to the originals and Joey performing better than ever should be enough for you to get a general idea. However since this is Anthrax and we all know their Penikufesin EP and the many covers they have played on their albums, b-sides and live, we are used to something heavier (remember their version of Twisted Sister\u2019s \u2018Destroyer\u2019?) but that should not put you off. This EP is a fun little addition to an Anthrax collection for anyone.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard this EP was initially a vessel to promote their song \u2018Crawl\u2019 from the Worship album but honestly that song is the only one that feels out of place. Sorry to say it also is one of my least favorite songs they ever recorded with Joey. A rather cheesy grungy song which also was one of the worst songs on Worship Music. Their ballad-ish songs can't all be Black Lodges or Safe Homes of course. (I LOVE those two by the way)\n\nThe only downside, apart from \u2018Crawl\u2019, coming from this EP is not even (on) the EP itself but is its apparent consequence in general. Anthrax quite often fill their live set with many covers. I am starting to find it rather dull hearing them play Got The Time and Antisocial over and over again and this little EP, even though it\u2019s excellent, has led Anthrax to also put TNT in their set. When I go out to watch a classic Big4 band that only has a set of 45 minutes, I expect to hear as many of their own classic originals as possible put within that limited amount of time with maybe, possibly, one cover if they feel like it. But not three\u2026If they enjoy playing covers so much, maybe a hobby band under a different name would be a good idea. \u2018The entire population of Hackney\u2019 might be a good name. No, wait\u2026I meant \u2018Basket full of Puppies\u2019.\n",
        "\nLike the image of the album is showing, we are treated with real garbage music here. I am the first to accept or like change, but this is just painful to listen to. The sarcastic album cover is showing us a man who\u2019s watching a big garbage ball passing by. I can imagine seeing Anthrax looking at the result of this album and even thinking themselves that the quality is similar to what we dispose of. So Anthrax is the man looking to his own \"creative\" trash ball. I will explain in all the means necessary why this album is the worst thing Anthrax has ever done.\n\nFirst of all, I liked Sound of White Noise. I think this album had a certain charm with its own atmosphere and with enough variety to rival the first two albums of the band. This variety is exactly what is missing on Stomp 442. The drums seem to repeat indefinitely the same exact rhythm that sounds way too generic for the style in use. The style is way more generic than on the last album. This time, we don't have any external influence in hard rock or their metal roots. What we get is an exclusively grunge rock album with little variety. The guitars are just there but don't really add any substantial melodies or riffs that can keep the attention of the listener. All the songs are written in the same mould with little passages that really stand out. Only one song named \"Bare\" sounds different and is actually more interesting than the rest here. It's in fact a little rock ballad at the end of the album, but even then, the last part of this song is returning to the general sound of the album and is overall not even good.\n\nThe production is also another disappointing aspect of this release. The guitar is at the forefront without letting us hearing anything else. The different solos on the album seem forced into each song. The band seemed to try desperately to add some much needed variety but it still sounds forced upon the listener because the solos just don't fit at all the style they are put in. The bass is tuned down way too much. The drums have a quite unimpressive sound and the general mix seems to miss guts. The vocals on this release also sound different from the last release as they don't keep that little groove present in general over the course of Sound of White Noise.\n\nOn an emotional level, this album just doesn't seem to get anything straight either. It sounds again quite generic and way too unoriginal to evoke any feeling on the listener. The singer is not really at fault here because the lackluster production doesn't help him expressing his emotions. \n\nAbout this grunge album, there are much better albums of this same style that were already out at this moment that sound way less generic and give us many more memorable moments than on this release. Even past and future albums of the same band included more positive moments in the genre forecast on Stomp 442. So this is another reason to skip this release entirely.\n\nFinally, I just don't understand this missed opportunity. After a very good effort in creating something similar to this in form of Sounds of White Noise, I was stunned to see this band sounding so uninspiring this time around. With only half a good song there with the rest being a complete letdown, what we have left is only a garbage ball that stinks to an unimaginable degree.\n",
        "\nAnthrax's \"Chile on Hell\" is not only the best live release so far this year but also the best show of the band that was captured by cameras and microphones. The Chilean crowd is simply out of this world. Right from the opening riffs of \"Among the Living\", the entire crowd is singing along to the melodies and lyrics of this track, is getting involved into a giant circle pit with some fans sitting on the shoulders of others and some devotees are even enlightening a big red Bengal fire. This incredible crowd never gets tired throughout the entire show and is celebrating classics, cover songs and new material alike. The enthusiastic admirers are contributing to several intense goosebump moments. It's incredible to hear them singing the entire pre-chorus and chorus of \"Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)\" before the song even gets started, to watch them doing Dio's famous horns sign during the intense rendition of \"In the End\", to see them doing an unchained wardance to \"Indians\", to hear them yelling out the chorus with Joey Belladonna during \"In My World\", to see them doing a big mosh pit during the Slayer cover \"Raining Blood\" which was dedicated to late Jeff Hanneman who died only days before this show and finally to see them celebrating enthusiastically to the closing Trust cover \"Antisocial\". I've never ever seen such a great crowd as they even beat several one hundred thousand unchained Brazilians celebrating Iron Maiden on their \"Rock In Rio\" record. Every single fan seems to get involved in passionate and yet respectful hysteria for two unforgettable hours. I've never wished that much that I had been at a concert than when I first watched this.\n\nIt's not only the amazing crowd that makes this release so memorable. I've seen several Anthrax shows and while they always perform with passion, I've never seen them so vivid as on this output. The amazing crowd reactions must have been contagious. Joey Belladonna is doing one of his finest vocal performances in a long time. I was surprised how clean his voice sounds on this release and how he even hits the high notes while running around and interacting constantly with the crowd. Hands down, this man is a gifted front man and entertainer and this is why I'm so glad he's back with Anthrax as nobody else compares to him. Scott Ian is constantly jumping and running around with a big smile on his face. His angry backing vocals are extremely solid and he even hits some higher notes in the opening of \"In My World\" that impressed me quite a lot. In addition to this, his killer riffs are still performed with passion and precision. Frank Bello is walking, headbanging and dancing around the stage and never ever stands still. His extremely enthusiastic vocal performance during \"I'm The Man\" is absolutely contagious and his bass play is very powerful. Charlie Benante's drumming is as tight as it can be and still looks effortless because he is having so much fun on stage. He keeps smiling and making funny faces throughout the entire show. He even gets to play a short drum solo right before \"I'm the Man\". It's just long enough to show his great talent and short enough to get the crowd moving for the energizing encore. Fellow drummers, please take notes on this essential, precise and short performance as nobody wants to listen to drum solos over six minutes or so. New guitarist Jonathan Donais plays very well but looks a little bit shier and more introspective than the other members. He's got his own personality I guess but he slightly feels out of place. I guess he simply needs some more time with the band to get used to this new situation. From a purely technical point of view, his performance is spot on though.\n\nThe set list of this concert is phenomenal. It contains the three best songs from the band's amazing last effort \"Worship Music\", the greatest classics including the six thrash metal milestones that open the legendary \"Among The Living\" release and a bunch of amazing cover tracks from AC/DC, Joe Jackson, Slayer, Stormtroopers Of Death and Trust. Some people keep complaining about the high number of cover songs during Anthrax' shows. If you take a look at the incendiary crowd reactions to these tracks and the way Anthrax performs these renditions, you do realize why these guys are still including so many of them and I don't want to miss these tracks. Anthrax' cover tracks have always been amazing in my opinion. On a side note, the DVD version of this release seems to omit two tracks from the original concert which are the Joe Jackson cover \"Got The Time\" as well as \"Deathrider\". It's possible that these tracks are included on the BluRay release though as I've read other reviews where analysts would talk about these songs as well. If you can choose between both versions, you should go for the BluRay variant.\n\nFrom time to time, the outstanding concert is interrupted by very short sequences showing other Anthrax shows, the band backstage, fellow musicians commenting on thirty years of Anthrax, fans praising the band or Scott Ian on the set of a TV show. A couple of snippets from the band's last studio album are played during these sequences, for example \"The Devil You Know\", \"The Giant\" and \"Judas Priest\". These breaks are very short and only about one to two minutes long each and really don't bother the enjoyment of the energizing concert at all. It would have been interesting if the band had included a little documentary about its career as a bonus but that's not the case and this release only focuses on the music and a few short additional gimmicks.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the sound is crystal clear and yet absolutely authentic. One can hear the crowd very well but the vocals and the instruments also sound very sharp. It's definitely an honest live release as one can still hear a couple of small technical mistakes here and there. The image is perfect as well but some people might not like several quick cuts, shaky camera passages when Joey Belladonna is running around with a camera on stage and a few split-screen passages. I think these little technical elements make the whole release even more diverting, energizing and original. These elements are not overused as on Iron Maiden's \"Death on the Road\" release for example. If these elements bother you, I guess you're really just nitpicking.\n\nIn the end, this concert and release come extremely close to perfection. If the DVD release had included the two missing tracks and if Jonathan Donais' performance had been a little bit more enthusiastic, I would have given the perfect score to this output. Still, this is an absolutely essential release for any Anthrax fan, any thrash metal maniac and anyone who cares about authentic, energizing and original rock or metal music in general. Believe me, you won't regret anything if you purchased this release as soon as you possibly can. For me, this is by far the best metal release in the year 2014 and already my very favourite live record ever. You may argue that I shouldn't judge this output shortly after its initial release but this is one of these few and special releases that simply blow you away from the very first second and I couldn't stop celebrating this masterpiece. If you listen and watch this release, just make sure you don't destroy your home by getting caught in a giant Chilean mosh.\n",
        "\nSpreading The Disease, Anthrax's sophomore release, is their first album with Belladonna on vocals. He is much better than his predecessor, or his successor. The music at play here is somewhat improved over the debut, but it would improve greatly moving to the next album. On this, they still had plenty of kinks to work out.\n\nThe vocals on here are great, and he apparently won some awards for his performance on this album. On songs like A.I.R., he adds a great amount by the way he sings. On that song in particular, he hits a level of clean vocals that very few have hit. Most of the time, I just think of Joey as good, but he's great on that song. He gives an epic feel to that song that would rival some of Dickinson's better work. If you don't believe me, listen to the song again. This album is designed where he can more easily showcase his good range and much less of the grit seen on Among and Persistence.\n\nThe drumming is as good as expected as Benante puts up a reasonably good performance. A track like Madhouse features some excellent double bass. He is pretty easily the most interesting instrumentalist. The bass player on this album is new, Frank Bello. He is the nephew of the drummer and he had been a roadie for them. Lilker would go on to form Nuclear Assault and also worked on a few other bands. Frank here is fairly audible, but he really doesn't do much for my liking. \n\nThe guitars on here are fairly mediocre. These are just not very good, varied, technical, or interesting in any way riffs. They are big and sometimes fast. This is enough for me to enjoy a handful of tracks, but the playing is just plain meh. The soloing as well is rather odd. Some people enjoy Spitz's solos, but for me they're just weird. They aren't very aggressive, melodic, or technical. They are also rather similar after awhile. Ian is on TV a great deal these days and I wonder if he isn't being used as a sort of obligatory metal opinion/aficionado. I find this rather bizarre as Joey and Charlie are far more enjoyable than Ian has ever been, and there have been many metal bands to chose a voice. I suspect that the force of the east coast media (yeah, I went there) has helped him out in terms of staying relevant.\n\nThe direction on here is not focused. Most of the reason Joey can show off his range is the fact that much of this is USPM. I enjoy early Fates Warning and several others, but they made whole, quality albums off of it. This is a power/thrash mix that alternates at times and just doesn't work very well for me. It might have also helped had the album been consistent in quality. There are a few gems here, but most of these are just uninteresting. One positive I will note is the difference between Madhouse and (Welcome Home) Sanitarium. The former works better as a song because Anthrax understand what kind of subject matter they're dealing with. Escaping from or living in an asylum is not deep or heavy. It's just either sad or funny. Anthrax carefully made it into the latter and it works very well. Metallica chose to try to make it heavy and they failed.\n\nThis was just not a very cohesive or, at the end of the day, a good album. It isn't unlistenable, but I wouldn't want to go start to finish either. A. I. R., Madhouse, and Aftershock are the songs that I enjoy. For as much love as this album often gets by old school thrash fans, I just don't really get it. Anthrax did much better on Among and Persistence. I suspect it's a built-up love from nwobhm. This still had many of those elements of simple catchiness, among others. I'm not much a fan of that style, so an album that was hearkening back when it was new does little for me and I doubt it will do anything for a younger listener.\n\nI recommend a fan of early, power, or thrash to grab the songs I mentioned. A fan of nwobhm could perhaps enjoy the whole thing.\n",
        "\nThis is probably the strongest classic Anthrax release. It is also likely their strangest. This is a fairly consistent album with very little that I would dump. This is also pretty different from their previous albums. The artwork is my favorite of their catalog.\n\nOn the consistency, most of these songs are pretty good. Got the Time had to grow on me, but the first three in a row is one of the better starts to an album any thrash band has had. The songs do drop a smidgen, but H8 Red is the only real stinker. It seems too slow, and the feel of the song is just very meh. This is one song though, so all is still well, and a full entire listen is still enjoyable. This is a rare statement for Anthrax. Euphoria was a weak and odd album, and most of the first two were mediocre USPM. This and Among are the only reasonably consistent albums out of their classic period.\n\nThis is different from their previous works in two ways. The first are the lyrics. The previous albums may have been cynical, but not in a dark way. They gave a feel of \"street-wise\" more than anything else. This has much more of a condemnation of society feel than the previous ones did. Among and State had toyed with this idea, but it actually comes across well here. The odd swearing is rather needless, but at least their not obsessed with it. The other is the atmosphere to the album. This is several times heavier than anything on State and most of Among. This is a mixture of the new production and their new ability to actually write a good, serious song. I do miss songs like I Am the Law, but these are about as good, and more consistent.\n\nThe drumming on this album is pretty good, Benante didn't disappoint. His double-bass is quite strong, and after Lombardo, he was probably the strongest drummer of the big four. For that matter, he is probably the strongest member of this band instrumentally. I've heard that Benante wrote much of Anthrax's music, which wouldn't surprise me. Anthrax always struck me as very rhythmic-centered album. Bello on bass is loud, but he isn't very interesting. I would liken hearing him to hearing Araya on the second half of Hell Awaits. Is he audible, yes, but is he doing anything worth hearing, not really. He isn't poor, but I expect something more when the bass is this audible.\n\nThe vocals are as good as to be expected. Joey has a good deal of range, but he also has a certain grit that I think draws many in. On this album, the focus is more on the grit. His shrieks are still there, but they are not as prominent. This was his last album with Anthrax, until recently, and I believe it a testament to him how much better this and Worship Music is to anything they've done in the meantime.\n\nThe guitar playing on this album is very rhythmic. These are some of the best riffs Ian and Spitz played, but their not awesome. To be honest, Anthrax's riffing was what turned me off of them for a while. Most metal bands, I go straight for the riffs. With Anthrax, the riffs are more of the fast or big than anything else. There isn't a ton of variety or technicality, and focusing on them is not the way to go. These are better, but many albums of lower quality had better riffs than this. Since I've also heard that Ian wrote most of the lyrics, he does deserve some congrats, these are the best he's ever done there as well. As for Spitz, I'm honestly not sure what real purpose he serves. His solos are just weird and don't fit the songs. He does thicken the sound during the rhythms, but I feel like you could just double Ian in the studio for that.\n\nSome of this probably comes off as complaining, but I do enjoy this record. Joey and Charlie were amongst the best in thrash at what they did. I have no idea what the politics were that got Joey kicked out, but their follow-ups were the poorer for it. I docked points for the aforementioned weak song and for the relatively weak guitar playing. If you enjoy thrash and don't hate Anthrax, then I'd say that you need this album.\n",
        "\nLess than two years after their diversified party album \u201cWorship Music\u201d, the sympathetic American East Coast thrash metal institution Anthrax comes along with a new fun ride in form of the EP \u201cAnthems\u201d. This release includes six cover songs plus a song from the last album in form of the modern and slightly alternative rock or grunge influenced \u201cCrawl\u201d. This song also comes along in an alternative version that has already been included on the Japanese version of the last full length release and that surprises with more experimental orchestral parts. The remix happens to be as great as or even more interesting than the original which doesn\u2019t happen so often.\n\nConcerning the cover songs, Anthrax chose six classic tracks from quite well known Western hard rock bands. Even though the songs are well done, I miss a few experimental choices and a truly courageous cover of the six well known tracks. Another mellow version of AC/DC\u2019s \u201cTNT\u201d simply wasn\u2019t necessary for me for example. Honestly said I even prefer Puddle Of Mudd's version of that song.\n\nOn the other side, the challenging Rush classic \u201cAnthem\u201d was covered in a great way and is almost on the same level as the progressive original version. This is by far the best song on this EP. It didn\u2019t only give this release its name but opens the record with a lot of positive energy.\n\nThe new versions stick all very close to the originals and don\u2019t really have their own note. Thanks to a good production, a solid instrumental work and last but not least a very convincing job by singer Joey Belladonna, the songs though still work well enough.\n\nFaithful Anthrax fans should get this EP if it\u2019s offered at a low price. Add to this that the simplistic but very fitting vintage cover art is also very appealing for collectors in my opinion. There are six different versions of it, so you can really waste your money on that. Those who usually listen to hard rock and don't like heavy metal, should also give this record a try because Aanthrax indeed delivers some energizing hard rock music on here without making it sounding all too metal orientated. The cover songs are also be included on a new edition of \u201cWorship Music\u201d. The metal fans in the world who haven\u2019t bought this vivid record yet have one more big reason to do so by now. Anybody else could though also skip this release as it\u2019s just an entertaining gimmick but far from being outstanding. Let's hope that this band soon comes around with some new material after this swansong by Rob Caggiano who left the band after the recording session and finally joined Volbeat.\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Observer\n",
        "\nFistful of Metal and Overkill's debut Feel the Fire go hand in hand to my ears. Both are energetically delivered, sonically flawed slabs of speed/thrash architecture. However, while Feel the Fire contained multiple indisputable classics like \"Rotten to the Core\" and \"Hammerhead\", Fistful of Metal can't necessarily boast the same. The one true trump card that Anthrax has in their deck here is Turbin's air-raid siren of a voice, which is far and away more impressive than any other vocal effort the New Yorkers have committed to disc. I'm personally a big fan of John Bush (mainly in Armored Saint) and Belladonna is a functional-enough front man, but both lack the unhinged decadence present in Turbin's sound barrier-breaching screeches.\n\nThat said, a more interesting observation is that Fistful of Metal actually thrives when it slows down ever so slightly, allowing the atmosphere to accrue behind the spirited performances. As such, \"Howling Furies\" and \"Anthrax\" are two of the highlights, the former introducing a more controlled, perfunctory assault on Turbin's part alongside more well-planned songwriting. The band's namesake piece \"Anthrax\" features more of a dissonant atmosphere, and the main riff that the song revolves is murky and potent, definitely a step in the right direction. The hit \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" is a bit more mid-paced as well, and features a more anthemic slant and some great singalong lyrics.\n\nOtherwise, Fistful of Metal is decidedly hit-or-miss at times. Spitz's proclivity to bust out a wailing solo at any (and nearly every) time is a nice touch, but after a while it starts to become too expected and loses some of it's slicing edge. The production is honestly a bit of a mess, with individual songs sounding entirely different regarding the mix along with uneven delivery on Turbin's part. The short instrumental \"Across the River\" and the opener \"Deathrider\" sound entirely different and more uneven than the rest of the record. The leads are sharp and biting, but Ian's rhythm is almost universally buried. It doesn't necessarily matter a whole lot, as Turbin is usually hogging the spotlight, but there are some decent riffs buried beneath the excess that deserve to be heard.\n\nThe entire middle section of the album does little for me, with only \"Soldiers of Metal\" making a strong case for it's existence. The rest is delivered with conviction, but not very well written or memorable. Being a debut, Fistful of Metal naturally gets a pass on many of these fronts, but it still damages the ability to tackle the album in a single sitting. The only other notable track is the Alice Cooper cover \"I'm Eighteen\", which is one of the highlights and a great transposition of a true classic.\n\nTo bring up the Overkill comparison again, they were wise enough to include a few doomy dirges into their early material like \"Overkill\" and the latter half of \"Kill at Command\". This added a decent counterpoint to the more blistering numbers and cumulatively added to the lasting power of the material. Either through lack of songwriting ability or desire to rock as hard as possible, Anthrax falls slightly short of the same prize on Fistful of Metal. The dismissal of Turbin due to tension within the band's ranks shortly after was one one the biggest mistakes Anthrax ever committed (and trust me, there are many). Regardless, as it stands, Fistful of Metal is decent and worth a listen - even if for historical significance alone.\n",
        "\nThis is the album that people know as the last with singer Joey Belladonna until 2011's Worship Music. Belladonna stuck around for another year or two after, but didn't seem to have as much input on the band's later releases, particularly Attack of the Killer Bs, where he is absent on a fair few tracks, suggesting that there was tension in the band. In 1992, he was fired and in came John Bush. So, how does the final full length album with Joey Belladonna in his initial run measure up to everything that came before? Well the short answer is: it's fantastic, and it's the best Anthrax album to date. However, I must give a longer answer for the sake of this review.\n\nThe most important factor about this particular album is that although it still has an unmistakably thrash metal sound, it has a much more angry feel than any of the band's previous albums, and also abandons the use of humour that was a large part of the previous two albums specifically, Among the Living and State of Euphoria. Therefore, the subject matter is much darker and more serious, covering themes such as paranoia (\"Time\"), isolation (\"In My World\"), and intolerance (\"Keep it in the Family\"). Joey's vocal delivery is often quite vicious, often using his low register, such as in the beginning of \"In My World\" in which he sings \"I'll bite the hand that feeds me, and I could give a damn if that hand needs me\", which is particularly effective in setting the album's overall atmosphere. The band had lost a lot of their gear in a fire whilst the album was in its early stages, and it certainly seems to have influenced the band member's moods and attitudes, and as a result, greatly influenced the album.\n\nMany of the songs last at least 5 minutes, with the first four all lasting 6-7 minutes each. There are plenty of instrumental elements with solos galore, characteristic of the thrash genre to be heard and enjoyed, in which Scott Ian and co. play their instruments like the end of the world is nigh and it's the last thing they'll ever do. The passion and overall emotion is to be admired. The songs get shorter further on in the album but there are still plenty of excellent twists and turns crammed into the songs. \"Intro to Reality\" and \"Belly of the Beast\" form a single piece of music, though the split into two is appropriate due to the intro lasting 3 minutes, and some listeners may instead choose to cut to the chase. The intro is worth praising, however, as it utilises a harmony guitar, played by Charlie Benante, which gives him a good opportunity to show that he is not just musically talented in the drumming department. It is worth mentioning that Benante has always played a large role in the composition of the band's music, and he certainly excels on this release.\n\nThere are a small number of songs that remind me of the kind of Anthrax song you might expect to hear on ATL or SOE. These are songs that either contain lyrics that still have a small level of humour in them, or just sound similar musically to a typical track from those albums. \"Discharge\", for example, is a solid thrash number that contains the lyric \"Life? What life? What's the difference between you and death?\" which is a personal favourite lyric of mine. Another example is the cover of Joe Jackson's \"Got the Time\" which the band speeds through in under 3 minutes. Quite an appropriate choice of song to cover, too, as it is in keeping with the album's loose concept of time.\n\nThe album cover itself features a clock with skulls in place of numbers, and skeleton arms in place of the regular \"hands\" on a clock. The artwork, as well as some of the lyrics, seem to carry the message that we need to stop hating one another and learn tolerance before, basically, it is too late and we all die (or rather, run out of time). We must act now or else we will just watch that time ticking away.\n\nThis is by far one of the band's most serious efforts, but it's also their best. Although songs like \"Caught in a Mosh\" and \"Madhouse\" are classics that helped Anthrax rise to fame, they are little more than headbanging anthems, which is fine, but Persistence of Time shows that they can go beyond that and tackle more serious subject matter, and put together a damn solid release based around it. It also serves as a swan song of thrash metal, as the next few years would see several thrash bands, including Anthrax, changing their musical styles in order to survive in a decade of changing tastes with grunge being a prominent genre, but at the time, Anthrax seemed to be on top of their game, and today Persistence of Time should still stand as an essential metal album that served as a great final chapter to both their first run with Joey, and the dominance of thrash in the rock/metal world.\n",
        "\nWith Joey Belladonna deciding not to stick around after the band's 2005-2007 reunion tour, most fans were left in doubt as to whether he would record an album with Anthrax again. This album began life in 2008 when the band had new vocalist Dan Nelson in their ranks. However, there were obviously problems between Nelson and the rest of the band and by the next year, he was out. They went back to their other old singer, John Bush, and together they carried on touring, and it made fans speculate as to whether he would be the singer for Worship Music. However, Bush simply didn't want to commit to it and decided to leave again, which opened the door for Belladonna to return. Soon, it became pretty clear that Belladonna would be the singer, and this decision was certainly no mis-step.\n\n\nThis albums finds the bands revisiting their old thrash metal roots, yet does not sound like a rip-off of their classic albums. However, the band sounds more metal here than they had in many years, with their Bush albums generally having more of a straightforward rock feel. I'm a fan of Bush-era Anthrax and did appreciate those albums, but it's great to see Belladonna reunited with his old bandmates and making some great, heavy music together. It's a reunion album that sure doesn't suck.\n\n\nThe album's lyrical themes vary, but there's still definitely a theme running across: a celebration of metal. The album title and artwork alone strongly alludes to it, as well as references to metal bands in some song lyrics. \"In The End\" is an emotional tribute to fallen rockers Dimebag Darrell and Ronnie James Dio - now the band were especially affected by Dimebag's loss due to his work with the band on previous albums, providing additional solos, and was even referred to by band members as the sixth member of the group. The song is one of the best on the album. Belladonna's vocals are melodic and strong, and the band are tight. \"Judas Priest\" is...well, it's kind of obvious from the title - a tribute to the metal band Judas Priest! There are references to several Priest songs throughout. Another epic. In keeping with the metal celebration, there is an instrumental intro titled \"Worship\" and two \"Hymns\" that serve as musical interludes. When the track listing was revealed, I was a little worried that the band would be going overboard with the whole worship music theme with these tracks and that they would resemble a church meeting, but with heavy metal as the religion. Thankfully, when I listened to the album upon its release, I was proved wrong. This instrumentals serve as nice introductions for the track that follows.\n\n\nThe band's general attitude shines through well throughout. \"Fight 'Em Til' You Can't\" on the surface is a song about killing zombies, but is also, in Scott Ian's own words \"a metaphor for out attitude\" and that sounds just about right. The band has had to fight through a lot of obstacles in their career such as lineup changes and record label shutdowns, and they've sure come out on top. Many great metal songs are about protests and taking back what's yours, and Anthrax has songs like that on here, too. \"Earth on Hell\" and \"Revolution Screams\" are anthems that have apocalyptic undertones; they speak of the fall of empires and oppressive powers and the rise of a free world. And of course, Anthrax were inspired by books, films, and TV back in the day, and this tradition is carried on in \"The Constant\", which was inspired by the TV show \"Lost\". I'm sure \"Lost\" fans will certainly appreciate the lyrics on this one.\n\n\nStepping away from the faster songs (\"Earth on Hell\", \"Fight 'Em\", \"The Giant\") is the slow moving, menacing \"Crawl\". It's the first time we've really heard Belladonna sing a downbeat Anthrax song, and it's quite new to hear him sing in a lower register like he does here for some parts, but also rather refreshing.\n\n\nOverall, fans should not feel much disappointment from Worship Music, if any. The band play very well and are just as fast, heavy and full of attitude as they always have been. Belladonna's voice has become a little deeper with age but if anything, this fits in well with the material on the album, perhaps more so than if his voice sounded exactly the same as it did in the 80s, yet it's still undeniably Belladonna's voice. The album has so many memorable moments and it does heavy metal a lot of justice, giving us a reminder that there are great things still to come from Anthrax.\n",
        "\nFirst of all: if you're new to Anthrax and you want to listen to a good variety of their hits and the fan favourites first, do yourself a big favour and avoid this compilation. This is not an ideal starting point.\n\nFirst of all, it's seriously lacking. 11 tracks can't cover all of the band's best stuff, and some of the song choices don't help either. I mean, where's \"Caught In A Mosh\"? Where's \"Be All, End All\"? Yet this album features songs like \"Belly of the Beast\" that are nowhere near as popular. Another horrible thing is that the album lacks their first rap metal song \"I'm the Man\", which is a crucial part of the band's general influence on music, yet they decided to include the lacklustre '91 version instead? Whoever was putting the track list together clearly didn't do his/ her homework very well. You really think the band managed to influence anyone by repeating samples of \"Fuck that shit!\" one after the other? No, neither did I.\n\nAnd of course, there's the absence of any Neil Turbin or John Bush material. Hello! Joey Belladonna isn't the only singer the band has ever had. I know the Turbin and Bush eras are not as popular, but it wouldn't have hurt to at least throw \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" and \"Only\" into the mix.\n\nIt's no wonder this album flopped. Not only are there enough Anthrax compilations out there that are far better, but this album really doesn't give you all of the best stuff. Please ignore this failed attempt at a \"greatest hits\" collection.\n",
        "\nStale bread works. It's fine. Put a little mayonnaise and some deli meat and cheese and you have a decent lunch. Anthrax's stale songwriting is made stronger by record company muscle. That muscle makes this album widely available to the masses for cheap consumption. Much like stale bread.\n\nThat cheapness is the very reason I got this album. I remember sampling a trough of Anthrax on the internet a long time ago, and even then thinking that it sounded pretty boring. But I saw this new, not even used, at a fye for like 6 bucks, so I snatched it up. Now it\u2019s nigh impossible to make me regret a purchase so cheap, but thank goodness it is cheap.\n\nThe songwriting here is very boring. The only parts that separate the songs in my memory are the vocal lines, which are delivered with gusto by Belladonna. He doesn't have the most powerful voice, but his enthusiasm comes through, even if he sometimes sounds pretty flat and flawed. The chorus of Lone Justice is a great example of his voice just not being strong enough to achieve what I think they wanted to achieve. \"...stubbled chin, he rides through historeeeeeee!\" Listen to it, it falls so flat of the power it should have had. Which makes the cheesiness of the lyrics that more obvious.\n\nHe fares better and tracks like Madhouse and Armed and Dangerous, where his wonky delivery fits perfectly with the music. Like the weird inflection used when belting out \"Armed and DANGER-US!\u201d I find his best performance vocally here is on Medusa, my personal favorite here, because the vocal lines are the most memorable.\n\nFor musically this album struggles to hold my attention. For one, the guitar tone is like the tinny sound on ...And Justice for All but without the concussive power to them. Though unlike Justice this album actually has a great bass tone albeit it just follows the rhythm guitar. And the guitars are so uneventful; it drives me crazy thinking how and why this band got signed to a big label.\n\nAfter repeated listens, almost no sections are in my memory. I just fucking listened to it two minutes ago and I don't know how the hell I'm going to finish this review! Grasping at straws, the main riff of A.I.R. is nice and bouncy, with a good groove to it. And it's no surprise that I remember that riff, since it is repeated through the entire song....\n\nBut really that\u2019s all I can remember. The songs do not progress in a memorable fashion. There are no great bridges, or solos that stick out at all. Just decent rhythmic chugging for every song. Only a few decent choruses. Madhouse comes to mind immediately, and the delivery is one of the more solid of the album, though still lacking a lot of the power I wanna hear from my metal vocalists. \n\nThe few chorus sections that aren't decent are downright grating. If gang shouts are your thing then pick this up, but holy shit it annoys me. I was gonna count how many times STAND OR FALL is shouted in that damn song to illustrate my point, but I can't put myself through it. Armed and Dangerous would have been a highlight if it wasn't for the freaking gang shouts. And Gung-Ho is downright annoying for the same reason. Some albums gang shouts sound a little off (like The New Order) but here the tone is actually pretty good, but that does not mean it should be flaunted 3000 times in the 45 minute run time.\n\nThe Enemy is a nice moodier track and, along with live staple Madhouse, has a very good use of gang shouts. But the album definitely suffers from an over-saturation of them, and even the more effective ones aren't as powerful as heard on \"In Union We Stand\" or \"Wake up Dead.\" In fact on every level this album isn't as effective as a slew of other thrash bands. The riffs go in circles, the drumming is hardly noticeable, forget about memorable, the bass is there which I suppose makes it better then on some albums, and the vocalist sounds less like a singer and more like a guy with a high pitched voice. But, as stated before, this album can be found very easily, and for cheap. \n\nAnd that is my verdict and tip of the day for you. This is not horrendous or revolting. It's pretty effective in some respects. It\u2019s got a decent bass tone, a respectable vocalist though his range and dynamics are not top quality, and a nice lightheartedness to it that makes it pretty charming. But if you really want some good early east coast thrash, Overkill is a much better option. So grocery customer, will you grab the stale bread that\u2019s readily available or dig a little deeper and find some fresh baked honey-wheat?\n\nFor lacking a lot of substance to every aspect of the album, Anthrax's Spreading the Disease gets 45 out of 100 or 2 out of five.\nHighlights:\nMedusa\nMadhouse\n",
        "\nThere are four albums I think of when I think of great thrash metal. Metallica's Ride the Lightning, Slayer's Reign in Blood, Megadeth's Rust in Peace, and Anthrax's Among the Living. These albums make up what I call the Thrash Starter Kit. You want to get into metal's most rewarding subgenre, you better do your homework. This album takes what makes those other three great and amalgamates them into a perfect example of how the fastest, heaviest, and finest thrash metal is created, but without being inaccessible to a non-thrasher. So, just how good IS Among the Living, and what's so good about it? Where do I even begin? \n\nInstrumentation is incredibly tight here. This is one of those albums where every single note played feels important, and not a single one out of place, which is an impressive feat for an album that moves at such breakneck speed. Scott Ian's riffs are complex but still memorable, Charlie Benante's drums are so tight and fast, you'd think he would have gotten advanced Carpal Tunnel after just a few takes, and Frank Bello's bass is not only layered and proficient but actually audible, something that you almost never hear in thrash metal. I have always believed and will always believe that Anthrax with Joey Belladonna is the only Anthrax there is, and his presence is invaluable on this album. His voice is both melodic and aggressive, something that can only be accredited to such legends as Rob Halford or Dio. \n\nThe writing is downright fantastic. There's a perfect balance between dark humor and unrelenting social and political commentary, sometimes both at once. Two tracks stand out to me lyrically; Efilnukefesin and Indians. The former I should mention because it is handled strangely. The song is famously about Jon Belushi, but it's hard to tell if it's a tribute, a scold, or if they're cracking jokes about his death. In any case, despite the poor taste in which it's handled, the track rocks and is still very well written at its core (with another of the album's always-memorable chant choruses). The latter track, Indians, merits mention again, not for its subject matter, but the way it's handled. Countless artists have written about the plight of the Native Americans, and the \"Evil white man comes and takes our land\" narrative. While I understand the gravity of the atrocities committed during that tragic period in American history, Anthrax is the only artist who's ever handled that much-hackneyed material in in effective way (at least for me). You will indeed cry for the Indians.\n\nThe production is a bit fuzzy in spots, but still just as sharp as it needs to be. I'd like it to be just a bit better, especially considering that the brilliantly-produced Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? had been released the previous year (on a shoestring budget, no less), but I can't complain. If I needed an exact comparison point, I'd say this sounds about as good as Ride the Lightning. It's still pretty stellar when you consider the circumstances, and the contrast is very even, something Reign In Blood didn't handle nearly as well. \n\nAmong the Living, and Anthrax in general, manage something that few thrash bands (especially in the Big Four) have ever done-they actually have a little fun, and deal with some less serious subject matter. They balance the deadly seriousness of tracks like Indians or Skeletons in the Closet with tracks like I Am the Law, a tribute to the classic comic book Judge Dredd. The acoustic intro to Horror of It All, cryptically titled A.D.I., actually stands for \"Arabian Douchebag Intro\", poking fun at the Bay Area thrash cliche of acoustic intros to \"epic\" tracks (someone really should have told that to Testament...but that's another story.) \n\nI would say Among the Living's strongest link is also its greatest downfall-it hits its peak way too early, with the incredible, breathtaking title track. Everything that is great about this album, about Anthrax, and about thrash in general is put on showcase perfectly here. The band works tightly and perfectly as a unit rather than just the sum of its parts, no one steals the spotlight, and best of all, it blends both the hardcore influence of East Coast thrash with the unrelenting technicality of Bay Area thrash. Among the Living by Anthrax is one of the greatest anthems in all of thrash, and one of my favorite metal songs of all time. Every track on this album is great, but none quite live up to the opener.\n\nSo, that's Among the Living. If you haven't heard it, you shouldn't even be on the Archives right now. When an album's biggest flaws are some ever-so-slightly fuzzy production and having a track that is literally TOO GOOD, it has to be worth your money. I recommend it to absolutely any metal fan.\n",
        "\nFew thrash acts could ever claim to be as diverse or as flat-out fun as Anthrax were throughout the 1980's. This was the band that released such songs as the great cover of Got The Time and the entirety of Spreading The Disease. However, the band were at their most enjoyable period, in my opinion, upon the release of Among The Living. During a period where bands such as Slayer and Kreator were playing as fast as humanly possible and Megadeth were experimenting with odd structures and a more technical side of thrash metal, Anthrax were busy reinventing their own brand of thrash.\n\nThis was the band's breakthrough album, containing some of their most well known songs such as fan favorite Caught In A Mosh, anthem N.F.L, the thundering anthem Indians and the incredible title track. This was where Scott Ian, Frank Bello, Charlie Benante, Dan Spitz and Joey Belladonna managed to revolutionize the thrash scene with one of the most bizarre albums of its day, an album that has stood the test of time and remains a classic to this day, although often overshadowed by Spreading The Disease.\n\nThis album was the last album to feature any form of credit given to Danny Lilker, the bassist of Anthrax throughout Fistful Of Metal, who left shortly after that album. His contributions stretch to having written a small amount of the songs I Am the Law and Imitation Of Life. Among The Living was dedicated to Metallica's bassist, Cliff Burton, who had passed away prior to the release of the album, and was a major influence on Frank Bello's style of play, and the album was the band's major breakthrough, with the video for Indians having had a large amount of airplay on MTV.\n\nThe sound for this album is a large change from what was found on Spreading The Disease, being a little more fun and relaxed, with not as serious an overtone. Whilst Spreading The Disease still carried Anthrax's stamp, the band had clearly matured a lot as musicians over the thirteen months that separated the two releases. Here we have a slightly more progressive nature to the songs, with some of them having rather unconventional structures and numerous riff changes in the space of a short amount of time, whilst still being crushingly heavy and maintaining a speedy pace to much of it.\n\nThis truly is a cracking album to just put on and get dragged into the signature Anthrax sound, maintaining a completely light hearted sound to it throughout much of the record. I Am The Law and N.F.L. stand out as being the best of the bunch, with the latter being a speedy thrash number with thoroughly enjoyable and yet incredibly sarcastic lyrics, coupled with that amazing voice that Joey possesses to make for a great listen. However, it is the former that takes the belt as the standout song of the album. It is a song about Judge Dredd, with brilliant lyrics about the comic book legend himself, and one of the most progressive feels to it of any song of the album. In the first minute alone, we are showcased Anthrax at their riff-happy best, with six fantastic riffs strung together in such a way that it flows perfectly, and containing a number of tempo changes. This is how classic thrash metal should be crafted.\n\nCaught In A Mosh, the title track, Indians and Imitation Of Life take the styles already outlined and showcase them all to a near perfect degree. Indians contains the infamous shout of \"WAR DANCE\" and an absolutely killer drum beat, possibly the finest drum song of the album. It has a stomping feel to it, and thunders along with breath taking confidence. Imitation Of Life is a perfect closer, after the long predecessor A.D.I./Horror Of It All, being fast and to the point. Caught In A Mosh, however, is the real winner of these four songs, with the marvelous bass intro that shows off Frank Bello's style really well, before launching into a straight forward thrasher.\n\nOne World and A Skeleton In The Closet, in my opinion, are not quite as good as the other songs found on this album. A.D.I/Horror Of It All may suffer from being too drawn out, but it does not detract from the album itself, merely slowing up the pace a little. One World really does come across as a song that is just there to bridge the gap between Indians and A.D.I, whereas A Skeleton In The Closet just never clicks together, feeling like a half finished song. Despite the clever lyrics and the above average vocals from Belladonna, this just felt like a song where the band had not got enough ideas for the song.\n\nThis album is undoubtedly one of the finest releases thrash metal has to offer, but is still not quite the band's best. Whereas this had a couple of filler songs, the band managed to iron that crease out over the album that would follow, ready for their masterpiece, The Persistence Of Time. However, if you really want straightforward thrash with a lot of utterly hilarious and yet completely thought provoking lyrics and instrumentals that leave many bands standing throughout, this is definitely an album to purchase.\n",
        "\nThis album is Anthrax's own 'Load'. Man (or should I say Not Man), this is a broad take on modern metal and rock. And yes, country music too, just what Metallica did two years earlier. So, no thrash metal mentioned yet, but hey, you won't find it here anyways. I understand if a band stagnates and wants to do something different, but for fuck's sake, this is not-so-few steps over that border, that changing the band's name would have been a must, not just \"in order\".\n\n'Crush' is like a Kiss song played with almost constant multilayered tom drum beats and modern downtuned guitars. It is far from crushing, because downtuned isn't a synonym of \"heavy\". 'Catharsis' is the band's most mainstream song ever together with last album's 'Nothing', but if it works, then it works! A fine, hellishly rolling good song, if you don't wait for thrash metal, which you shouldn't be doing at all. Nu-yet-good 'Inside Out' goes a bit too Fugazi at times, but John Bush's catchy vocal lines keep it over the surface. 'Piss n Vinegar' is a stomping rocker, similar to those that 1998's 'Stomp 442' was filled with. '604' is a \"funny\" fastie, in S.O.D. way, but... And then it comes; the fucking country song 'Toast to the Extras'. It has a true redneck vibe to it, but this is a fucking Anthrax song?! Man... I mean Not Man.... 'Born Again Idiot' is a Pantera style piece, and definitely the harshest of the album's songs. But harsh isn't a synonym of \"good\". Hey, it is the half-way point now, and what the hell is going on on this album? Exactly.\n\n'Killing Box' is like Anthrax going Primus or something, but in a totally torpid way. 'Harms Way', a slow rocker, gets the album rolling after a long period. Or does it really? Nope, as 'Hog Tied', with Kiss riff played in nu-style, does its best to drop the level of quality again. And it does, with a big thank to the use of guitar talk box, reminding me of Richie Sambora. Thanks for that, heh. With 'Big Fat', the album goes to Corrosion Of Conformity style stuff and really rocking again. 'Cupajoe', another S.O.D. thingy, cuts the flow before it has even started. 'Alpha Male' is a bland rocker, followed by another slower song, 'Stealing from a Thief', which is another good slow song on the album! Not Man, there's something weird here, right? I mean slow songs work better than the majority of faster pieces. Anyways there is a hidden bonus track, which is extremely soft. The songwriting is bloody broad, but partly so bloody boring. I would have waited something like these songs on Anthrax's mini-albums or b-sides.\n\nDuring the album, there's a lot of various instruments used, that feel more like curiosities: Theremin, blues harp and slide guitar. But then again, this is more of a rock album than a metal album. Pantera's Dimebag Darrell and Phil Anselmo make appearances on a couple of songs, but also these are more like curiosities. Sound-wise this is on heavy and organic side, but the downtuned guitars have never been my favorite thing, and they aren't particularly heavy either. The band aren't on their best here, not even close. The rhythm section is the element that works the best here. Actually there's quite big chunks of groove on some of the songs. And so work John Bush's vocals, I've always liked his characteristic and a bit harsh voice. The cover art is a small part of astonishing painting printed on the opening lyrics sheet. The lyrics are very streetwise.\n\nWhen picking out the truly good songs, I can count them with one hand's fingers. So, there's EP's worth of good music on this album. Surely, it is all listenable, but just scarcely so at times. In my opinion, this is the worst Anthrax album ever, but only their second bad one (the predecessor, 'Stomp 442', was plagued by the same problem; just a few goodies). This just does not feel like it was Anthrax. The album's name proved to be ill-boding.\n\n(originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2009)\n",
        "\nOriginally published at http://suite101.com\n\nNo one can agree on how long it\u2019s been, but it\u2019s generally accepted that the Anthrax camp has been in an awkward spot for quite some time. Ever since classic vocalist Joey Belladonna left the band in the early 90s, they\u2019ve gone through a long wave of commercial obscurity and confusingly constant lead singer switches. Originally intended for a 2009 release, Worship Music is the band\u2019s first album since We\u2019ve Come For You All came out in 2003. It is also the first Anthrax release to feature Belladonna since 1990\u2019s Persistence of Time due to the rather random sacking of touring vocalist Dan Nelson and noncommittal stance of other iconic singer John Bush.\n\nFans who are expecting the second coming of Spreading the Disease or Among the Living are sure to be disappointed for this effort has very little in common with either of those classics. Instead we\u2019ve got a release that probably wouldn\u2019t have sounded too out of place if it had come out between Persistence of Time and Sound of White Noise. As someone who is only familiar with a handful of the songs Anthrax released with Bush, the rather modern production and larger focus on grooves do give this effort a rather similar feel to that era. Fortunately there are a few old elements such as the signature gang vocals ensuring that no one will confuse this for being some other band.\n\nAnd with all of the history there is to consider, it is nice to see the band showcase some solid chemistry. The guitars in particular are aided by the production and have a sharp and dark tone that recalls the previously mentioned Persistence of Time. Despite Belladonna still feeling like the odd one out in terms of the overall band dynamic, his vocal contributions are quite strong and fit in well with the songs on display. He has inevitably lost a bit of his upper range with age but makes up for it with some impressive harmonies and contrasts. In a way, he brings to mind a less tired Geoff Tate and may be one of the best vocalists left from the old thrash era!\n\nUnfortunately, the rhythm section doesn\u2019t stand out quite as often as before and seems to get caught in the mix throughout. Fortunately there are some exceptions as drummer Charlie Benante provides some amazing blasting on \u201cEarth On Hell\u201d and \u201cRevolution Screams\u201d while bassist Frank Bello has a brief solo on \u201cJudas Priest\u201d and gives \u201cI\u2019m Alive\u201d a particularly heavy feel.\n\nWhen taking out the random interludes and looking at the album on a songwriting basis, it appears to have a set cycle of sorts as it starts out fast and then goes into more mid-tempo tracks. This move seems to work in the album\u2019s favor as it shows off the band\u2019s various styles while making sure everything fits in and demonstrating an eye for memorable hooks.\n\nIt goes without saying that the opening three songs were among the first singles released for they do provide some great bursts of energy. \u201cEarth On Hell\u201d features some powerful drumming and strong verse/chorus transitions, \u201cThe Devil You Know\u201d works as a rocking cross between \u201cKeep It In The Family\u201d and \"Caught In A Mosh\u201d while \u201cFight \u2018Em Til You Can\u2019t\u201d recycles the old \u201cGridlock\u201d riff to surprisingly great effect.\n\nFrom there, the pace goes a bit more mid-tempo though the next few songs show some nice variety in themselves. \u201cI\u2019m Alive\u201d serves as a catchy anthem, \u201cIn The End\u201d is a dramatic tribute to Ronnie James Dio and Dimebag Darrell, and \u201cThe Giant\u201d is a catchy number with some solid vocal trade-offs in the verses and some infectious layering in the chorus.\n\nThe last four original songs seem to be a mix between the first five while not fully committing to either side. A song called \u201cJudas Priest\u201d would suggest a much faster tempo than the one on here, but it and \u201cCrawl\u201d do feature more excellent vocal acrobatics. In addition, \u201cThe Constant\u201d seems to hint at a faster tempo while \u201cRevolution Screams\u201d features some solid groove-influence riffs.\n\nClosing things out is a cover version of \u201cNew Noise\u201d by the Refused. While I've only heard the original once or twice at the moment, this does manage to be another solid Anthrax cover thanks to more great transitions and vocal work. In this sense, it isn\u2019t too out of place with everything else on here though one does wonder why they decided to make it a hidden track. At least they didn\u2019t go with the cover of Alice in Chains\u2019 \u201cWe Die Young\u201d that was rumored at one point. That just sounds wrong on so many levels\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to hear a thrash metal group from the old guard put on a brutal show that rivals the material from their younger days, then you might want to look into Overkill\u2019s \u201cIronbound.\u201d Some may continue to hope for a more old school sounding record but this release seems to serve as a compromise of sorts between those days and more recent material. In this sense, Worship Music is a pretty successful effort as it employs some strong songwriting techniques and great musical performances. And if this effort and the recent performances of \u201cOnly\u201d are anything to go by, things might not have been too different if Belladonna had just stuck around the entire time. It\u2019s certainly hard to imagine what this would\u2019ve sounded like if Nelson had been on it\u2026\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\u201cThe Devil You Know\u201d\n\u201cFight \u2018Em Til You Can\u2019t\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Alive\u201d\n\u201cThe Giant\u201d\n\u201cCrawl\u201d\n",
        "\nUSA's Anthrax, a legendary band, pioneers of the East Coast thrash movement in the early 80's and part of the \"Big 4\", which also includes three other legendary bands Megadeth, Slayer and Metallica. While maybe not as huge today as they were back in the 80's and 90's, Anthrax rose to metal stardom early with albums such as 'Spreading the Disease' and 'Among the Living'.\n\nVocalist Joey Belladonna, who joined the band in 1984, became the face of Anthrax (as well as guitarist Scott Ian) and enjoyed the band's more fruitful years before being unexpectedly fired from the band in 1992.\n\nAnthrax recruited John Bush from Armored Saint and then began the second evolution of the band; moving away from the shrinking thrash metal scene and delving into a more groove/heavy metal style. Albums of note include 'Sound of White Noise' (1993) and 'Volume 8- The Threat is Real' (1998), Anthrax really re-invented themselves during that period.\n\nThe band had numerous label problems in the mid to late 90's which ultimately took a toll on everyone involved. By 2001 Anthrax found a new home with Nuclear Blast (Europe) and released 'We've Come for You All' in 2003. From there came instability in the line-up (that I like to call the Van Halen syndrome) which saw both bassist Frank Bello and guitarist Rob Caggiano leave the band (Bello returned the following year), while John Bush was ousted in favour of a reunion with Joey Belladonna and guitarist Dan Spitz. For the next few years this revolving door continued between the abovementioned members - Belladonna out, Bush back in, Spitz out and Caggiano back in; and in between a new vocalist Dan Nelson would come and go and still no new material produced in almost seven years. The sad soap opera had one final twist in 2010, when once again Belladonna reunited with Anthrax and John Bush was again shown the exit.\n\nThat brings us to now and finally after eight years of instability, playing favourites and other bullshit, Anthrax have released a new album, entitled 'Worship Music'. Firstly there's a bit of nostalgia in the air, hearing Joey Belladonna's untarnished voice on an Anthrax album for the first time in 21 years and I must say that he's still got it after all this time. The main difference between Joey and John Bush is that Belladonna is far more melodic and sings at a higher pitch. On 'Worship Music', Belladonna's vocals are quite melodic, more matured but overall much like where he left off from 'Persistence of Time'; and some of the songs are a reflection of his vocals, containing more melody than ever before.\n\nSound-wise, Anthrax have quite a different mix thrown to please the fans of both their 80's thrash and 90's groove/traditional metal eras. While they still have their goofy side incorporated somewhat into their music and lyrics, for the most part the song-writing and perception is fairly serious, much like how they performed on 1993's 'Sound Of White Noise' album. The opening speedy and gritty track \"Earth on Hell\" is very much old school Anthrax, in which the song could have slotted in easily on their 'State of Euphoria' album, while the impressive \"Fight 'Em Til You Can't\" could have come from either 'Spreading The Disease' or 'Fistful of Metal'.\n\nAs usual we get nothing short of greatness from versatile rhythm guitarist and original member Scott Ian, and arguably one of the best drummers in the world, Charlie Benante. Anthrax's next current member after Belladonna, guitarist Rob Caggiano also proves to be worth his weight in gold, with a very solid, energetic and professional performance that is full of hard groove and thrash-esque riffs and excellent solos.\n\nThe remainder of the album sits somewhere between the sounds delivered from albums such as 'Stomp 442' up to their previous effort (which seems like an eternity ago) 'We've Come for You All', but in a far more matured and polished fashion. Those jam shorts and the antics the guys used to wear and get up to have finally been locked away and burned on the pyre; this is Anthrax all grown up and it sounds good. By far the best track on the CD has to be the brilliant and infectious \"The Devil You Know\", just for its supreme guitar riffs and creativeness; overall it's almost the perfect metal song and easily one of Anthrax's best in their entire discography. Other tracks that makes 'Worship Music' a very good but not utterly fantastic album would be the bold and purposeful \"I'm Alive\", the melodic and emotional \"In the End\", the respectable homage to \"Judas Priest\" and the groove-infused head beater \"The Constant\".\n\nHas 'Worship Music' been worth the 8 year wait? Well to die hard Anthrax fans, the answer would be a strong hell yes, as the album is very solid and for the most part quite entertaining and diverse. Any fans from the beginning who have since moved on should find that this release may rekindle their interest in the 'Thrax, while thrashheads of old will also find it hard to resist the new album. So for the moment, Anthrax have a stable line up, so let's hope it stays that way and another album finds its way to our ears in the next few years. A great, matured and honourable effort from the boys that I personally thought they could not achieve, but have been pleasantly surprised.\n\nOriginally written for www.themetalforge.com\n",
        "\nFor the better part of 20 years, from the end of their 80s era and early 90s stint with Belladonna still in the fold up until just recently, Anthrax had solidified their status as the ultimate example of how far a band can tumble down the nu-metal ravine. After the somewhat commercialized yet still hard thrashing goodness that were \u201cState Of Euphoria\u201d and \u201cPersistence Of Time\u201d, this band was eventually relegated to a Scott Ian solo project with John Bush and the rest along for the ride, hopping onto every stupid trend with legs in the billboard charts. Coherence was not to be found, as former Armored Saint vocalist John Bush went back and forth between being a lackluster Layne Staley impersonator to a god awful Phil Anselmo knockoff, surrounded by a barrage of dumbass ideas that were more suited to the likes of Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, two horrid abominations that Anthrax themselves had unintentionally influenced years prior through a handful of joke songs mixing metal and rap music.\n\nTo sum it all up, Anthrax took the biggest plunge of all the Big 4 (excluding Metallica\u2019s post 2001 debacles and present insult to art \u201cLulu\u201d), thus making any chance at metallic relevance almost 100% contingent on a complete reversal of their recent style choices. The beginnings of this were moving into the realm of possibility during a short-lived reunion with Belladonna back in 2005 that managed to treat the fans to a powerhouse of a live album and DVD. But alas, like a bad habit, the band split with their 80s mainstay vocalist and were ready to plunge back into marketable mediocrity by recruiting a hack, nobody, generic screamer in Dan Nelson, who few in the metal world probably ever have heard of, let alone accept. While it was during this time period that much of what became \u201cWorship Music\u201d was composed, the live renditions of these songs were utter garbage that even Trivium would be apt to avoid releasing, and it does speak a little bit to the slightly confused tendencies of some of the music found on here.\n\nBut after the unfortunate passing of metal god and legend Ronnie James Dio and a corresponding memorial concert, Belladonna found himself back in the fold and suddenly Scott Ian found the discipline to actually get his ass into the studio and put out an album. With this came the 2011 reunion album \u201cWorship Music\u201d, perhaps one of better genre confused thrash metal albums to ever be released. Its contents can be likened to a number of albums put out both by Anthrax during their latter 80s period, as well as a few numbers from the forgettable 90s Anthrax era and Belladonna\u2019s slightly better solo work. And yet it finds itself working well, in spite of some modern groove metal pitfalls, because of the superior musicianship of the collective whole. Joey\u2019s vocals and Scott\u2019s riffs have a natural synchronicity to them that was never achieved after the former was kicked out of the band, and this endures despite Dan Spitz not being present (though Rob Caggiano sounds remarkably similar to the band\u2019s original fret board speeder).\n\nThe initial impression left by this album seems to lend itself to a return to the \u201cPersistence Of Time\u201d paradigm, with occasional instrumental interludes somewhat resembling classical music ditties the band occasionally played around with around the same time (the cello intro of \u201cBe All, End All\u201d comes to mind). The three lead off songs (two of which were singles) play up the thrash element something fierce and in the usual, streamlined fashion Anthrax has always dealt in, with \u201cEarth On Hell\u201d being the most vicious and chaotic (though \u201cFight \u2018Em Till You Can\u2019t\u201d rides close behind). All of these songs feature punishing riffs, fancy lead work, soaring vocal brilliance and gang choruses aplenty, all but forcing the listener to acknowledge the inevitable resurgence to greatness going on.\n\nBe all this as it may, some pretty obvious deviations in style loom soon after this initial trilogy of thrash ownage, ranging from slowed down metal to semi-Pantera infused fluff that hints back to some of this band\u2019s 90s disasters. The only outright instance of failure is the hypnotic, dumbed down ode to \u201cFar Beyond Driven\u201d with a hint of Alice In Chains that is \u201cCrawl\u201d, which sounds like it came right off of Belladonna\u2019s throw away 2nd solo album meets a really poor version of something from \u201cSound Of White Noise\u201d with a decent guitar solo as the only saving grace. A few other songs such as \u201cI\u2019m Alive\u201d and \u201cThe Constant\u201d are markedly better, playing up more of a modern sound with a slight USPM character to the riff work. None of it quite breaks back into thrash metal territory, but it\u2019s still quite good and showcases the raw talent of Belladonna to add luster to what is otherwise tainted ore.\n\nWhile \u201cWorship Music\u201d may not be fully passable as a pure thrash metal album, it is such a long overdue change in direction for the better that it\u2019s hard to really care. Suffice to say, aside from Slayer, who have remained pretty loyal to their root style (though with mixed results at times), the media created Big 4 have never really been the most stylistically consistent examples of thrash metal, especially when compared to bands that didn\u2019t last long past the 80s such as Dark Angel and Vio-Lence. Truth be told, it could be argued that \u201cAmong The Living\u201d, which was Anthrax\u2019s purest thrash album, was hampered by the utter sameness of its contents. There\u2019s a sort of happy middle ground that Anthrax had going after said 1987 breakthrough album, and this is closer to it than not. If nothing else, this band is poised to do better still on future albums should they happen, especially if this lineup can stand to keep itself together, lord willing.\n",
        "\nFistful of Metal is the first studio album by the east coast thrash metal veterans Anthrax. Since the beginning, Anthrax has being a very unique case within the borders of thrash. They would draw great influences from the NWOBHM scene, have a vocalist who could actually sing (in this case, Neil Turbin, and in later albums, Joe Belladonna) and yet incorporate elements of hardcore punk, especially in terms of harsh sound and fast tempo.\n\nIn this album yet, the punk influences are present, but they only function in such a way as to support the main structure of the songs where structure, as I mentioned before, is mainly consisted of NWOBHM influences (should I mention the twin lead harmony after the guitar solo in \u201cPanic\u201d that instantly brings to mind Iron Maiden?). Also, Neil Turbin performs high-pitched screams that are instantly reminding of Halford and Dickinson, although his voice is quite harsh and better described as a punkish tone sung in a heavy metal range. \n\nSo what makes this album a \u201cspeedy\u201d thrash metal record and not a \u201cthrashy\u201d speed metal record? As I said before, although the function of punk influences is to support the main NWOBHM structure, they consist of a key element. This support is what identifies the band's tune. Anthrax are filtering Judas Priest and Iron Maiden through punk simplicity as someone could figure out in songs like \u201cMetal Thrashing Mad\u201d and \u201cPanic\u201d (that, by the way, are the catchier of the whole album). \n\nGenerally speaking, Anthrax are actually quite good heavy metal musicians (the vast majority of all those who passed from the band), but Anthrax doesn\u2019t waste the meaning of their music in terms of \u201cextraordinary\u201d technique exposure (this doesn\u2019t mean that there are no bands that play \u201ccrazy\u201d stuff with passion and joy). They build their own trademark sound through harsh and fast riffs, blistering solos, a solid and simple, yet effective rhythm section, and a crazed singer on the microphone, highly energized and obsessed with a vision of demolition. They don\u2019t rely on using chromatic scales in order to make them sound \u201cevil\u201d (a key element for many thrash bands). The way they play their compositions charge the songs and the album in general with adrenaline and power, yet there are some melodic moments that seem like an explosion of gathered feelings.\n\nThe song structures are typical for heavy metal, being quite nice and straight, indeed. They don\u2019t play complicated progressive stuff; their music is made to be an instant heart attack to anyone who tries it. The sound quality of the recording is harsh and tough, transpiring the feeling of teenage spontaneity and anger. Anthrax play through the whole album living the very last word of their lyrics, banging to the very last note, and to the very last drumbeat.\n\nFistful of Metal is no Spreading the Disease and no Among the Living. Fistful of Metal is not Anthrax\u2019s best album. It is a monument of speed/thrash, a monument of what teenage hormones and the will to do something that counts can do. Along with Kill \u2019Em All, Show No Mercy, Heavy Metal Maniac, Skeptics Apocalypse, Feel the Fire, and many others, it sets the tune for the great thrash metal and speed metal explosion in the mid '80s. Fistful of Metal is classic among these great albums. No, it\u2019s not the best of them, but it is an excellent piece of speed/thrash history, essential not only for the fans of Anthrax, but also for anyone who likes this particular genre, this particular sound, and this particular feeling. The feeling of fast and angry heavy metal.\n\nGeorge ManoSwaR 08/12/11\n",
        "\nAlbum number four for New York metal thrashing extraordinaire's Anthrax. Persistence of Time used to be my favorite Anthrax album, and even though I give the edge to Spreading the Disease I still rate this one highly, and I prefer it to the likes of Among the Living.\n\nPersistence of Time has the distinction of being Anthrax's most accomplished release, well, as far as musicianship and performances go. The band decided to take themselves seriously here and this album feels right at home amongst the Victims of Deception, Years of Decay, Twisted Into Form crowd. A lot of the bands slight crossover element is largely missing, with the exception of the \"Got The Time\" cover, which serves as highly beneficial to the release.\n\nThe tracks are quite a bit longer than usual here, with the opening four numbers swimming a see of six - seven minute tracks. Anthrax really deliver over the longer time periods and the songs are given a lot more room to grow. When concerning production I feel that by todays standards Persistence of Time happens to stand up the best amongst the bands work with Joey Belladonna. The mix is fantastic, and the bass has a great prominent sound which as a result leaves this album sounding the heaviest of the Anthrax backlog. \n\n\"Time\", \"Blood\" and \"Keep it in the Family\" are all massive in scope as far as Anthrax goes, and these songs are among some of the best the band have done. From the darker edged riffs, to the build up and dynamics this is all good. \"Keep it in the Family\" is a particularly awesome example of Anthrax ala Persistence of Time. Not to blow their wad in the first half of the album we have the awesome \"Gridlock\" which houses some of Anthrax's most menacing work, and the bad-ass \"Belly of the Beast\". Proabably the catchiest track on the album (not including the cover), this was actually the first Anthrax song I ever heard, and has some fond memories attached to it.\n\nPersistence of Time is a really cool release, and is reflective of its given genre at the time. Thrash was pushing forward in quite an exciting way, yet somehow it all went wrong. Even now when we have a fuck load of caricature thrash bands, none of them try to progress like Anthrax did here. Despite the niggling \"Got The Time\" the rest of the album is awesome and is of interest of any thrash fan, especially those with interest in the later releases around the late 80's early 90's.\n",
        "\nI'm sure Among The Living isn't really desperate for yet another review, but what the hell; I'll bite. Two years after their excellent sophomore Spreading the Disease Anthrax lynched us with their thrashiest offering to date.\n\nScott Ian was obviously feeling the pressure of having to live up to the likes of Peace Sells and a whole host of other incredible thrash albums that were released in 1986. As a result Anthrax threw caution to the wind and aimed straight for the throat. This both served as a positive and negative, positive in the sense that this was awesome balls out thrash metal, negative in the sense that Joey's vocals took a back seat and in turn ended up sounding a little stifled.\n\nOf course this features some of Anthrax's best know tunes, live staples such as \"Caught in a Mosh\", \"Indians\", \"Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)\", \"I Am the Law\" and of course the title track are all decidedly awesome tracks, most of which I've seen live myself so I can testify to their bad-assery. There album is equipped with a boat load of quality thrash riffs, there are some excellent breaks, leads, Charlie Benante is on stupendous form, in fact with the exception of Belladonna the whole band are on great form. Which is by far the albums biggest draw back, what a waste of the man's talent.\n\nDespite the obvious standouts we still have ass-kickers such as \"A Skeleton in the Closet\" and \"A.D.I./Horror of it All\" shows Anthrax can keep it up over a longer track length (we would see more of this on Persistence of Time) For the most part Among the Living is a really cool album, although I don't feel it is up to the standard of their sophomore release. Still, this is mandatory for any thrasher.\n",
        "\nI used to always say  Persistence of Time was my favorite Anthrax release, however over the years I've come to land on the side of Spreading the Disease as both my favorite Anthrax album, as well as feeling it is their finest offering.\n\nThis was 1985 and thrash was really starting to take off, Ride the Lightning and Bonded By Blood were out tearing their fair share of heads, doing their bit for the Bay Area scene. Anthrax along with Overkill and their awesome debut Feel The Fire proudly flew the flag for the New York scene. Whilst Anthrax would later come to blend crossover with their thrash Spreading the Disease was pure heavy/speed/thrash.\n\nI can't stress how much of an asset Joey Belladonna was and is to Anthrax, as some people have of course mentioned he was given somewhat the short end of the stick as far as vocal lines went, I feel that on their debut and Spreading the Disease his vocal lines were really great, and he had plenty of room to do what he does best.\n\nRounding out the line up we had guitarists Scott Ian and Dan Spitz, the former delivering the kind of riffs he would be famed for, and the latter delivering some really cool and interesting leads, quite the underrated player when compared with some of the more flamboyant lead guitarists ala Megadeth, and bands such as Toxik or Heathen. The rhythm section was great, Frank Bello is as reliable as ever, and his bass is perfect in the mix, locked in with the drums provided by Charlie Benate who was at his best in the 80's. \n\nSpreading the Disease is home to some of the very best Anthrax numbers, \"Madhouse\" is both catchy and heavy, a live favorite that never fails to get the blood pumping. \"A.I.R.\" is the glorious album opener, reeking of 1985, an excellent exercise in thrashing brilliance. Other standouts would include the final double punch of \"Medusa\" and \"Gung-Ho\". The former is one of my very favorite Anthrax songs, with a certain degree of heavy/power metal to it. \n\nAnthrax often get a fair bit of flack, especially due to them be considered part of the media machine that is the \"big four\". I never bought into the whole \"big four\" thing, but that isn't to detract from what Anthrax were doing in the 80's. Spreading the Disease is right up there with the finer releases from 1985, and is a no brainer for any thrash metal fan worth his kutte.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m a bit biased when it comes to Anthrax. I was thirteen years old when the John Bush-fronted Sound of White Noise came out, and to this day it remains one of my all time favorite metal albums. While that recording marked a darker, more serious turn for the New York-based quintet, I still began to think of them as the \u201cfun\u201d thrash band as I explored their back catalogue. Here was a band that penned odes to Judge Dredd (\u201cI Am the Law\u201d) and Randall Flagg (\u201cAmong the Living\u201d), covered new waver Joe Jackson (\u201cGot the Time\u201d), duetted with Chuck D (\u201cBring the Noise\u201d) and even penned their own humorous take on rap metal (\u201cI\u2019m the Man\u201d). Can you imagine those stuffed shirts in Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer doing anything like that? More than the other members of The Big Four, Anthrax struck me as the band that wasn\u2019t afraid to follow their own muse and give the heavy metal rule book the finger. There was (and still is) something genuinely endearing about their approach.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to keep up with Anthrax after Sound of White Noise. Stomp 442 and Volume 8 \u2013 The Threat is Real came and went, causing nary a blip on my metal radar, and I didn\u2019t catch back up with the band until 2003\u2032s We\u2019ve Come for You All, a respectable album that seemed to signal a return to prominence. What followed instead was an album of rushed sounding re-recordings (The Greater of Two Evils) and a slew of live and compilation releases, not exactly the best way to capitalize on a five year layoff between albums. Then there was the infamous singer fiasco involving Bush, Joey Belladonna, Dan Nelson even Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor\u2026 it\u2019s a wonder Neil Turbin didn\u2019t get thrown in the mix at some point. This, combined with a dearth of new material put Anthrax in danger of turning into a joke.\n\nFast forward to 2011 and Anthrax is anything but a punch-line. Fully reunited with definitive vocalist Belladonna and riding a wave of renewed interest thanks to a slew of Big Four shows at various enormo-domes around the world, the band has unleashed Worship Music, their strongest album since Sound of White Noise and a damn fine slab of molten metal that recalls the strongest aspects of each era of the band while at the same time ushering the next phase of Anthrax\u2019s musical evolution.\n\nNevermind the cello intro, because \u201cEarth on Hell\u201d is Worship Music\u2018s real opening track, a hammering declaration of badass-ness if ever there was one in the mold of classic Anthrax. The band grabs you by the throat from the get-go and doesn\u2019t let up for the song\u2019s ferocious three minute and ten second duration. Up next is \u201cThe Devil You Know\u201d, another out-and-out banger that keeps the momentum going and is one of the catchiest tunes the band has ever written. I was skeptical of \u201cFight \u2018Em \u2018Til You Can\u2019t\u201d when I first heard it, but I must say that the the band\u2019s ode to the zombie apocalypse works great in the context of the album and sounds a hell of a lot better on CD than on the crappy YouTube clip that was making the rounds earlier this year. After this trifecta of ripping tunes, Worship Music delves into groove-laden, mid-paced territory that recalls the John Bush era. Many of these tracks, such as the epic \u201cJudas Priest\u201d the catchy/moody \u201cCrawl\u201d and the thrashy \u201cThe Giant\u201d work extremely well, while \u201cIn The End\u201d and \u201cThe Constant\u201d come off as enjoyable but ultimately skippable filler. The good on Worship Music far outweighs the bad and the album as a whole sounds surprisingly fresh in spite of its long gestation period.\n\nAs to be expected the musicianship throughout the album is top notch. Charlie Benante has always been one of my favorite drummers, and he certainly doesn\u2019t disappoint here, anchoring Anthrax\u2019s rhythm section with the same pounding authority he has brought to the band since \u201983. Scott Ian\u2019s ultra-crunchy rhythm guitar is still the defining characteristic at the band\u2019s core and if anything it sounds that much more crushing on Worship Music thanks to co-guitarist Rob Caggiano\u2019s thoroughly modern but not overly slick production job. Of course, the wild card in the Anthrax equation is Joey Belladonna, who hadn\u2019t recorded with the band since 1990 prior to Worship Music. Belladonna\u2019s vocals sound fantastic here and although he doesn\u2019t hit the piercing highs of the band\u2019s back catalogue, it\u2019s obvious that he hasn\u2019t lost a bit of his range. In fact, I\u2019d argue that his voice is more full and commanding now than it was a decade ago.\n\nAnd so there you have it. Anthrax has returned to the fold with an album they can be proud of, an album that largely shits all over anything the other members of The Big Four have released in the past several years, and most importantly an album that long suffering fans such as myself can revel in. By making the album they wanted to make and demonstrating full commitment to moving their music forward instead of pandering to Big Four/retro thrash nostalgia, they\u2019ve proven that they\u2019re still the band I loved as a teenager, marching to beat of their own slightly warped drummer. With Worship Music, Anthrax are back, bad and metal thrashing mad.\n\noriginally written for http://thatshowkidsdie.com\n",
        "\nWith the now well defined thrash scene, Anthrax was just another thrash band. Yes, they help invent the genre, and were the among the first thrashers out of New York, but they needed a masterpiece to secure their spot as one of the best and most influential and defining thrash metal bands. This masterpiece was called Among the Living.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Anthrax's material before Among the Living wasn't bad, but it wasn't nearly as mature, or as good, as anything from Among. Among the Living was where everything just came together. Joey Belladonna was at the highpoint of his career, Dan Spitz and Scott Ian were filled with memorable and thrashy riffs, Frank Bello was thinking up some unique things, and Charlie Benante was on fire with fast, thrashy drumming. Like I said, everything just came together.\n\nJoey is fantastic throughout the record. On the title track, Indians, and Caught in a Mosh, he hits insanely high notes absolutely perfectly (Example: Fire! Hot fire! Purge the world with fire!!) and doesn't sound strained at all, which is a big problem on their newest record. He's still young, and this is really where he shines. Unlike a lot of thrash singers, he actually uses his pipes instead of yelling or growling or things of that nature, and it really makes Anthrax the band that they are. His singing is really great.\n\nDan Spitz is an awesome guitar player. His solos on this record are really good. A lot of people don't like them, and I get where they're coming from, but they honestly are good. He uses the B and E strings along with the whammy bar to create really fast, thrashy solos. It's not clean or technical, but it sounds great and gets the job done.\n\nScott Ian also does a fine job on this record. His rhythm playing is great, especially in \"I Am the Law\", and \"One World\". And who can forget his yells? I know a lot of people bash Scott because they don't think he's that great, but the riffs he thinks up are out of this world, and he's wrote so many songs that nobody can doubt that he's a very talented musician. Also, the energy Scott Ian has live is unmatchable. Seeing Scott Ian live is a treat, to say the least.\n\nThe bass doesn't play a huge part in this album, but it does have really nice parts, like the beginning of Caught in a Mosh. Frank had some nice bass lines and provided a solid background to everything. He also had some cool parts in caught in a mosh and I am the Law. I think they could have let him do some more things, because he mostly followed the guitar, but he stood out and the bass playing was solid.\n\nCharlie Benante was just a beast on this record. His drum work on the title track, I am the Law, really every song was just fantastic. He was playing at really fast, aggressive speeds, and he used the crash cymbol A LOT. The energy is just really high, and the drumming is top notch. Everything is played cleanly and skillfully. The drumming is definately a highlight of this album.\n\nAs you all know, Anthrax is in the big 4, so Among the Living is one of the easiest metal albums to get ahold of, and it's a true classic. Get it. It's well worth the money. m/\n",
        "\nThe day I saw Anthrax's logo had reverted to it's old style (where the 'r' covers the 'n', 't' and 'h'), I spent the week trying to convince my friends that this was the sign we'd been waiting for: Joey Belladonna had returned. Of course, they dismissed it as merely a resurrection of their classic logo for the upcoming Big Four shows, and with good reason too: John Bush had only just finished touring with the band less than a year before, which came just after Dan Nelson (who?) was kicked from the band for yet unexplained reasons (apparently Scott and Charlie made up a rumour that he was ill, but who knows?). Regardless, I bought my Sonisphere ticket, knowing I'd end up seeing Bush. They'd play a set of songs not designed for Bush's vocals, and I'd have to live with that. But then the announcement came. Belladonna was back. Belladonna would be singing for the band during the Big Four shows, at the UK Sonisphere festival. The irony of it all was that a month before the announcement, a friend and I had written a list of bands we'd want to see before we die, and a smaller list of bands we could only dream of seeing. The second list - amongst 'The Doors with Jim Morrison' and 'Jello Biafra fronting Dead Kennedys' - included 'Anthrax with Joey Belladonna'.\n\nAnd so, 3 years after it was supposed to come out, 'Worship Music' is unleashed on the world. Ever since Joey was announced as the singer, most of us were expecting the band to return to thrash metal and all it's glory. But hearing the two singles, 'Fight Em Till You Can't and 'The Devil You Know', I realised the band is attempting something different. And are succeeding at it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is how easily I got hooked on the songs. Much like when I listened to 'Rust In Peace' or 'South of Heaven' for the first time, everything just flows, just makes sense. Almost all the songs have terrific, memorable choruses, to a point where I can't really name any stand outs. Stylistically each track seems to pick up from where that brilliant second half of 'Think About An End' and 1991's 'Belly Of The Beast' left off. Chugging rhythms and hooky melodies are the name of the game, and god does it sound good.\n\n'Worship Music' combines elements of thrash, groove, feel good heavy metal and modern metal in to a colourful pot of headbanging honey. 'Earth On Hell' is the only pure bred thrasher on here, with lyrics spat out with confidence by Belladonna, complex drumming by Charlie and a short but electric solo from Rob. 'I'm Alive' is a fun, headbanging comic book tale of vengence, with a Dropkick Murphys-esque intro and perfectly matched vocals, making it probably the crowning moment of side one. It combines the great digestibility of 'The Devil You Know' and the raw energy of 'Fight'em 'Til You Can't' to produce a vibrant classic, and definately something to look forward to live. 'Judas Priest' is perhaps the heaviest song on here, and definately Charlie Benante's best performance of the album. 'Judas...' is loaded with melody, driven by a typical Anthrax groove, and features this intense breakdown which a few of us first heard briefly on the band's Facebook page many months ago. It crushes rhythms that the band hasn't crushed before, and stands as a fitting tribute to the Metal Gods themselves better than any cover could do. 'The Constant' and 'The Giant' have been called filler, but blow me down if those songs are any less catchy, any less satisfying than the other songs. Both choruses got stuck in my head since I first gave the album a spin, and out of sheer melody too rather than because of a cheap vocal hook. Anthrax are unlikely to perform them live, but for the time being they sound perfect in my car.\n\nScott's riffs are these fairly simple but effective: grooving here, thrashing there, overdubbing some extra guitars to add extra flavour (the intro of Dimebag and Dio tribute 'In The End', the harpsichord sounding guitars of 'The Constant'). Rob's solos are the most 'Anthrax' sounding solos since 'Persistence of Time', combining fast tremelo picking, tapping and more as the best showcase of his talents to date. Frankie gives a modest performance, rarely given any limelight besides the breakdowns of 'Judas Priest' and 'Earth On Hell'. Charlie rips the drumming up, doing a better job than ever before, with 'Judas Priest' being one of my favourite performances by the guy, especially considering the previously mentioned breakdown. \n\nAnd finally, the big one. Belladonna adds an extra energy to the songs, such extra bite, I couldn't ever imagine these songs being sung by anyone else. He might not sound like his 80's self, but he hasn't changed much since that awesome 'Ball of Confusion' cover in 1999. At this point, I'm not sure Bush (much love and respect to the man) could hold all the melodies Joey presents us with here, and I doubt Dan Nelson's pub thug vocals could do much better. He even makes the Refused hardcore classic 'New Noise' his own, the song's usual screaming replaced with the warmth of his melodic voice. And even if Scott and Charlie's lyrics don't always do Joey favours ('In The End' 's second half is weak in my opinion), I really can't wait see these songs live with Belladonna at the front of the band, where he belongs.\n\nThis is instantly listenable stuff, which doesn't slack on instrumentation or heaviness. It is pure party-appropriate heavy metal, with tongue in cheek lyrics just like the old days, and their best effort since 'Sound of White Noise' and 'Persistence of Time'. This is a great album to play in the car or at metal clubs, and in my opinion, even if it lacks on thrash, the best of the Big Four's newest offerings by far ('Death Magnetic', 'Endgame' and 'World Painted Blood'). Worship metal? Worship Anthrax? Worship Music.\n",
        "\nEight years after their last output and after several strange line-up changes, Anthrax are finally back and underline their reputation and status as one of the big four of the American thrash metal bands. Worship Music sounds fresh and diversified and mixes the band's thrash roots with some modern influences and experiments.\n\nOne of the main strengths of the band is that they deliver many great anthems on this record that might as well kill it on stage. Two perfect examples are the already published energizing singles \"Fight'Em Til You Can't\" as well as \"The Devil You Know\" that mix thrash influenced verses with catchy, modern and melodic choruses. These two tracks are though probably the heaviest ones apart of the opener \u201cEarth On Hell\u201d. The rest of the album looks a little bit different.\n\nAnthrax also deliver some great epic experiments as the slow and atmospheric grower \"In The End\" that convinces with its melancholic bell sounds. One might also mention the epic \"Judas Priest\" where not only the vocals and guitars can convince but even the bass and drums that get some more space to breathe here. There are also the calm and modern sounds of \"Crawl\" that has some acoustic guitar and string passages and could also play on the radio along with bands like Nickelback, Godsmack or Puddle Of Mudd but has more depth and atmosphere than any of the mentioned bands. Even if this fact might not please to closed minded metal maniacs, many songs here have some great commercial potential with several addicting choruses like the radio friendly rocker \"I'm Alive\" that could have found its place on the last Avenged Sevenfold album. The musically traditional melodic thrash monster \"The Giant\" with its almost rap-like vocals in the verses versus a melodic and hypnotizing chorus is also a great potential single output and a quite interesting track. This modern catchiness includes even the weirder tracks like the numb groove rocker \"The Constant\" that is filled with subtle changes and many musical details that grow over and over after a first impression of a rather mellow kind. Many fans may now be afraid when I compare Anthrax to those bands but this mixture of modern radio friendly elements, commercial rock and roll approaches and some gripping thrash metal parts have distinguished the sound of this band for years now but this time they execute it even better than before with more gripping riffs, more memorable choruses and more courage to head for the unexpected even if this might not please to every fan out there.\n\nA third point I liked about the album are the orchestral interludes that are short and sweet but fit to the songs surrounding them and add a new touch and influence to the sound of Anthrax. Even though the band sounds quite diversified and slightly progressive on some tracks, they could though have worked even more with those ideas and might create some even more epic experiments for an upcoming record if they don't split apart once again.\n\nEven though there are a couple of weaker tracks like the too generic opening thrash track \"Earth On Hell\" that might though be worshipped by the more conservative fans or the pointless and slightly overlong album closer \"Revolution Screams\" (the hidden Refused cover \"New Noise\" (a Swedish hardcore punk band as far as I am informed) sounds much more energizing, diversified and has some modern approaches that make me think of early Linkin Park), this record is a stunning comeback for the metal legend and more than just a positive surprise. The album is easily in my personal top ten of the year and a relief after several weaker releases and eight years that have though been worth the wait after all. Overall, I really like this record and think that there is still more to come from this band once again.\n\nI would though be surprised if the popular reception of this record was positive as Morbid Angel got recently heavily bashed for their modern sound influences on their latest output that may be comparable to the new album of Anthrax with the exception that this one hear is less radical. That's why I would like warn you and suggest you to check this album out with an open mind for modern metal music before you might blindly buy it instead of hoping for a time warp back to the late eighties.\n",
        "\nThis album is being touted as Joey Belladonna\u2019s triumphant return to the Anthrax vocal helm. Also, based on the singles that have been released, \u201cThe Devil You Know\u201d and \u201cFight \u2018Em Till You Can\u2019t\u201d, the album seems to be being promoted as a return to the roots of Anthrax, namely thrash.\n\nIn listening to the album, it begins promisingly enough. (Not including the wasted 1:40 for the intro. GET TO THE MUSIC ALREADY!) \u201cEarth on Hell\u201d and the two singles begin the album. We already know about how good the two singles are, especially \u201cFight \u2018Em Till You Can\u2019t\u201d. \u201cEarth on Hell\u201d is a pretty heavy thrasher in the vein of old school Anthrax, with a nice tritone-based riff beginning the song.\n\nHowever, after the first three songs, the album starts to go a bit south. They have shown that they are capable of some nice thrash in the modern day. But it was too good to be true. Once \u201cIt\u2019s Alive\u201d comes around, the thrash comes in only through a handful of riffs. Other than that, it\u2019s the same hard rock-tinged Anthrax that we\u2019ve come to expect from the John Bush-fronted edition of the band.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that this is a bad thing. These songs, despite sounding like the John Bush era band, still sound inspired, which is really more than one could say about some of the other efforts on, say, \u201cWe\u2019ve Come for You All\u201d.\n\nSpeaking of inspiration, it clearly does show in the playing and riffing\u2014even the hard rock riffing\u2014as a direct influence of the resurrection of Belladonna. So how are his vocals? They\u2019re very good. They don\u2019t have the same youthfulness of the Belladonna of old. (Of course it wouldn\u2019t, it\u2019s been 21 years!) Belladonna, though, still sounds like he\u2019s having a blast singing these songs. The comparison I kept going back to, though, was Marco Hietala from Nightwish and Tarot. On this record, there are many points where he sounds JUST like Marco. I definitely enjoy his return and look forward to another album with him at the helm.\n\nA juicy surprise comes in the form of the hidden track. At 11:07, a cover of \u201cNew Noise\u201d by Refused starts. I\u2019m not going to lie, I was surprised to hear that Anthrax would cover this. It\u2019s a very well-done cover. Belladonna\u2019s vocals, though, don\u2019t quite fit the song as the original Refused vocalist\u2019s did. I still enjoyed the cover.\n\nAll in all, this album, like Metallica\u2019s so-called return to form, \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d, is a step in the right direction. However, it\u2019s not the full return to form that some might expect.\n",
        "\nAfter the astonishing Anthrax performance in Moscow in 2010 I was 100% sure that they are back in good shape after years of... well, let's say, uncertainty. So I was really looking forward to the release of this album. But when I finally managed to listen to it, I felt confused and disappointed... After a while I understood that the record is actually good and WAY better than any of their 90s stuff. \n\nFirst of all, it's metal. Neither grunge nor alternative, but heavy goddamn metal. So it's definitely pleasing for the fans of classic Anthrax, and I'm one of them (I spin my Among the Living LP quite often, huh). But... the real problem with this record is it's tempo. Most of the songs are mid-paced, and that makes them quite boring. The second problem is kinda connected with the first one - some songs are too stretched. I have nothing against a 6- or even a 20-minute track as long as it really keeps the listener's attention, but here... hell, it's the same trouble that Metallica had on their 2008 record (IMHO).\n\nOn the other hand, we have wonderful Joey Belladonna singing, his performance is probably the best part of the album. Another positive thing is the variety - they inserted some unusual sounds here and there (bells, for example). Also the album contains some killer riffs (Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't is one example) - however, they are often blended with quite bleak ones, and that makes them less \"tasty\". Once these guys were gods of the riff - when I was hearing those glimpses of good old Anthrax, I remembered songs like N.F.L. and sighed.\n\nSo, what's the summary? I was expecting killer Anthrax-brand thrash and instead I got a good heavy metal album, which is perfectly recorded but a bit too long, a bit too slow and has not so many remarkable hits. Still it gave me hope. Hope for more classic albums from this band which I was about to give up on, say, 7 years ago.\n\nP.S.: Russian edition of the album (which I listened to) has a separate bonus track New Noise (Refused cover), but I believe that the international edition has this track as well - only as a hidden one.\n",
        "\nMuch like the rest of the 'Big Four' (whether you subscribe to that idiom or not), Anthrax took quite a beating throughout the 90s, mutating their thrash sound to remain current with the perceived modernization of 'cool'. In other words, bigger and friendly rock radio chorus parts, traces of nu-metal replacing a lot of the band's meaty NY riffing, and a lot more 'diversification'. I'm going to level with you: I loathed John Bush as a replacement for Joey Belladonna to begin with, and Dan Nelson even more so. Not because John Bush is bad, mind you, but his deeper, smokey style was (and remains) such a far better fit to Armored Saint. Outside of \"Only\" and a small handful of other tracks, his tenure with the band was admittedly terrible.\n\nWhen they finally got their shit together and brought Belladonna back into the lineup, I admit to being excited, but also skeptical of what would manifest on the studio side. The drama was over, at last. It's almost like the two camps were halves of a sandwich: slap them together and they make for a delightful meal, but separate them and your tummy remains unfulfilled. So I had hoped that this next lunch would return the New Yorkers to the level of writing that made records like Among the Living and Persistence of Time such fun standouts in the Golden Age of the genre. And then I heard some of the 'Big Four' live performances...and Belladonna sounded atrocious on much of the material. So, yes, I feared greatly for Worship Music, not only because of the awful (and not even remotely as profound as the band likely thinks) album title and pretty bland looking song titles and lyrics, but because I was worried about the vocals falling apart.\n\nI'm very happy to report, then, that Joey is actually in quite good form here. He sounds almost as if he never left Anthrax, and what's more, the band's continued application of the big rock chorus allows him to stretch his chords even further (for better or worse). Worship Music is pretty much 65% Persistence of Time-era Anthrax, 25% modernized groove metal, and 10% safe to bring home to momma hard rock; and even though this is probably not the ideal revenge or 'comeback' effort, I admit that it's about the best I could have hoped for. The album is about 56 minutes of material (more songs than initially speculated), and although the last 11 minutes should have been snipped entirely, namely the shitty groove-rock song \"The Constant\", and the wholly underwhelming \"Revolution Screams\", it's quite consistently entertaining throughout, even with the baggage of the 90s and earlier 21st century in tow.\n\nThe strong points: Belladonna's vocals, which I mentioned, and the solid, pumping bass guitar performance by Frank Bello. Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano are also on fire here, but more for the taut and meaty tone and percussive riffing than for stepping up past their prior output. Tunes like \"Earth on Hell\" and the singles \"The Devil You Know\" and \"Fight 'Em Til You Can't\" were wisely placed at the fore of the album; and though I don't quite care for \"Devil\", which sounds like \"Caught in a Mosh\" made for prime time radio airplay; the other two are quite exciting with their balance of pulverizing muted speed and Belladonna's highly melodic arsenal. Others that stand out are \"The Giant\", despite the slightly corny lyrical scheme, and the bluesy, burning swagger of \"Judas Priest\", despite the oddity of its title and the far too serious seeming lyrics (for Anthrax, at least). In general, though, the first 40 minutes of the record are pretty much what we might have wanted (and deserved) as a follow up to Persistence of Time. If this had been dropped in, say, 1995 or 96, I think a lot of faith would have been restored.\n\nSo, yet another decent comeback from one of the 'contenders' in the US scene. Three for Four isn't bad (I enjoyed Death Magnetic and Endgame but am still waiting for a post-Seasons Slayer record with more than 1-2 good tracks on it). With its modern, bolstered production and largely even balance of melody and aggression, it's quite possible that Worship Music will place the old timers back in the graces of many who have turned their backs and lost interest. Mind you, anyone who completely hates the notion of Anthrax writing choruses in the vein of popular hard rock or punk is probably going to find a chunk of the album irritating. They haven't just written a retro 'return to form' record here. But there's enough of that authentic Anthrax to break out the tight jeans, hi-tops and that 'Not Man' tee you've been embarrassed about for the past 21 years.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMost will know the story behind Worship Music. It basically was the album they recorded with Dan Nelson, you know, Mr. Anselmo imitator Nr.1. But in the end we have the first regular full length studio album with Joey Belladonna since 1990\u2019s Persistence of time. With a release such as this we can ask ourselves two questions: As an entity on its own, is the album worthwhile? And secondly, is it a great Anthrax album? \nLet\u2019s elaborate.\n\nOn its own we have a fascinating, dynamic, diverse and mature metal album. There\u2019s no style taking the upper hand here since musically it\u2019s all over the place. Could be a mess but they\u2019ve kept it in the family. We have a few sparse moments referring to the thrash of old happening in Earth on Hell, Fight 'Em Til You Can't and The Giant. But most of the time it\u2019s mid paced metal, groovy riffs and catchy chorusses. I\u2019m Alive is a metal sing-a-long which could suit probably any band with an old school metal vocalist. It\u2019s entertaining. \u2018Judas Priest\u2019 is a bit of a mess melodically and compositionally. It feels like it\u2019s all over the place and has some nice heavy metal details but it\u2019s not a song that\u2019ll make history. A song that will make history is the tragic \u2018In The End\u2019. It\u2019s epic, melodic and it will move you.\nWorst moment on the album is \u2018Crawl\u2019. This has hardly anything to do with metal and is too cheesy to be true. A radio friendly emo tune which ought to be forgotten quickly. \u2018The Constant\u2019 has trouble make decisions. A Pantera clone in the verses or light-thrash? Not a bad song but since it has a hard time picking sides it can\u2019t entirely convince the listener. So all in all it\u2019s a rather messy album but has enough catchy moments and good tunes to be considered a fun release.\n\nAs an anthrax release we\u2019re faced with a bigger problem. This is NOT an album that\u2019ll bring back the days of Among The Living nor Persistence of Time. The presence of Joey after all this time almost feels coincidental as this album in a way sounds like a natural follow up to WCFYA with only a few hints to the old days. \n\nI played Among & State out loud in my car today and immediately played this album afterwards. When you do it like that it\u2019s like listening to another band with the exception of one song: Fight 'Em Til You Can't. That\u2019s about the only song which has that eighties Thrax vibe. Others might mention \u2018The Giant\u2019 but that\u2019s mostly because the pace is slightly higher than the rest of the album. When playing The Giant right after \u2018Finale\u2019 from State of Euphoria it becomes obvious it\u2019s more of a groove metal song on acid than old thrash. But I must say, it\u2019s a very enjoyable tune. Since I have my fair share of Bushthrax songs I really enjoy, this can\u2019t be a complaint. \u2018The Constant \u2019 tries to combine Bushthrax grooves with Joey-thrash and results in a somewhat contorted faceless composition which fortunately has a few good riffs in the faster parts and memorable vocal lines to keep one entertained. \u2018Earth on Hell\u2019 feels like a follow up mixture of What doesn\u2019t Die and Black Dahlia from the previous album and with Joey on vocals it feels like all era\u2019s of Anthrax coming together into one song. Highly enjoyable!\n\nAnother highlight is the epic \u2018In the End\u2019. It\u2019s not a thrash epic like Who Cares Wins or The Horror Of It All but a mostly slow and pounding metal tune with a melancholic atmosphere really suiting the autumn weather we\u2019re already experiencing. This is a daring track which will surely convince a lot of metal heads including non-Anthrax fans. It\u2019s just too good to ignore.\n\nIn a way Worship Music finally reveals what WCFYA would\u2019ve sounded like if Joey had returned earlier but fortunately adds some extra\u2019s like Fight \u2018Em, Earth on Hell and The Giant to please fans of old as well. One could say they might be making the same mistake as Kiss on their Psycho Circus album, namely trying to please everyone but time will tell how the metal community will look back on Worship Music in a few years.\n",
        "\nAnthrax has made their mark as one of the greatest thrash metal bands ever and their new single, \u201cFight \u2019em \u2018Til You Can\u2019t\u201d, further proves that title. This is the first single to be released for their long running upcoming album \u201cWorship Music\u201d which has had many re-writes and re-recordings over the 3 year production period, but has finally seen the light of day. \u201cFight \u2019em 'Til You Can\u2019t\u201d is basically Anthrax\u2019s wake up call to their fans yelling, \u201cHEY, WE ARE BACK! OUR GRUNGY GROOVE METAL DAYS ARE OVER!\u201d But most importantly, let\u2019s get to the details of the song. \n\nThe lyrics have a simple, but very entertaining theme\u2026.killing zombies. With the song starting with a fake radio broadcast talking about, \u201cbody\u2019s rising from the grave and attacking the living\u201d. The song itself contains very catchy riffs and great drumming from Charlie and when listened through a good sound system, some well-placed bass slides delivered by my buddy Frankie! Like I\u2019ve stated, this is a great song, one of the best Anthrax has written in years and even if you\u2019re not interested in the new album, punch this song in on Google and download it for free off of Anthrax\u2019s website. You won\u2019t regret it!!!\n",
        "\nRiding on a chugging, back and forth riff which is impossible not to fist pump/head bang to, Joey gives a stellar performance on vocal duties unlike anything he's done before. He's sounds young and optimistic, but also channels the likes of the late Dio (The title itself is most likely a dedication to Ronnie's last album wth Heaven & Hell), combining it with the grittiness he showed he had in his solo stuff. He's definately the main attraction here, as the backing music is easily digestible, slimline modern metal, only better produced than 'We've Come For You All' and more energetic than your usual throwaway radio tracks. The breakdown begins a little to plain for my liking, but once Joey re-enters in a positively epic fashion, all is forgiven.\n\nSome of the lyrics can be bad ('It's just the devil in me/there's no hypocrisy/what you see is what you see/what you get is what you get!), but Scott and Charlie's lyrics have never been quite the same after 'Persistence of Time'. Thankfully, those kind of lyrics sort of just fit the song, and are sung with believable passion by Joey.\n\n'The Devil You Know' is pure party metal. Easy to listen to but melodically more interesting (that riff!) than anything since 'Stomp 442', as chantable as any of their classics (this will no doubt be a blast live) and it has totally changed what I want from 'Worship Music'. You see, for the past year, a lot of us wanted the band to return to their thrash roots, but you only need to look at the Big 4's latest releases to know it isn't always a great idea. Production has changed dramatically - no one can quite agree on the right sound ('Death Magnetic' was too loud, 'World Painted Blood' is rough in the wrong places), and the amount of riffs and talent left is thinning ('Endgame', or any of Megadeth's last four albums). So I'm almost glad Anthrax seem to have made it a priority to try and marry their classic sound with a more easy going heavy metal approach. 'The Devil You Know' adds buckets of colour where World Painted Blood' seemed bland, better production when 'Death Magnetic' rears it's ugly face and doesn't make my ears sick like 'Endgame'.\n\nI've heard a heavily censored 'I'm Alive' (another track set to appear on 'Worship Music') on the NHL12 soundtrack and that follows the same pattern. A cool riff, catchy melodies and vocals courtesy of Belladonna and a real sense of enjoyment. We just need to face the fact that 'Worship Music' isn't going to be 100% old school thrash, but rather a modern, feel-good heavy metal record, which could be the most enjoyable thing the band has done since 'Sound of White Noise'. You can sit there and blame Rob and Scott's involvement in 'The Damned Things' (with members of Fall Out Boy and Everytime I Die), but personally this is the right direction for Anthrax. Things are fun again in the Thrax camp!\n",
        "\nSay what you like about Anthrax, but it must have been the coolest thing to see them live with legendary rap group Public Enemy, whilst touring the 'Persistence of Time' album. I knew of Public Enemy long before I'd even heard of Anthrax, even before I'd heard of thrash metal, and I've always had a soft spot for them. A lot of fans of guitar based music tend to dismiss rap as artless music. 'It doesn't take any effort!', 'It's just talking in to a microphone!', 'Where are the instruments?' they'll no doubt say, ignoring lyrical subjects, and disregarding how much a rapper has to perfect the art of delivery, how much effort the sound engineers put in to make the genre sound as clean and professional as possible, and how good an ear the artists and their DJs have for samples and drum loops. I'd much rather listen to a cleanly recorded rap album by the likes of Public Enemy or Ice-T (of the most ironic 'Cop Killer' & Law and Order: SVU fame) than some poorly recorded metal album, clung to like winnets by the most unlovable of metalheads. Anyway, back to 'Attack of the Killer B's', which features covers, remakes, unreleased and live tracks, released shortly after the tour.\n\nThe covers can be awesome - There's 'Parasite', (one of Anthrax's many Kiss covers) which is suitably sped up to a grooving thrasher. The story goes that after hearing Anthrax's version, Gene Simmons believed the band had hired a new singer, and couldn't believe it was Joey after all. He does a sterling job. Then there's surf anthem 'Pipeline' (originally by The Chantays), which is covered with such intensity, it's hard to imagine someone surfing to it. It's more... jet-ski appropriate. But the others aren't quite as worthy as the originals, 'Sects' is a little weak compared to Trust's original and the cover of Discharge's 'Protest and Survive' (featuring Scott on vocals) isn't particularly exciting.\n\nMy opinions on the S.O.D. tracks are based on the fact I know the originals. Most fans tend to write them off, and I definately prefer the original 'Chromatic Death', and I don't think 'Milk' needed the extra length, but both are well executed (whilst not a shining example, Joey doesn't sound too out of place singing crossover, something I'm always quick to point out).\n\nThe reworked version of Public Enemy's 'Bring the Noise' is, quite possibly, Anthrax's crowning moment of coolness. Channeling the fury of the original perfectly, Anthrax turn up the tempo and the gain, introducing heavy guitars and a live drumkit. It features the obvious suspects: Chuck D and Flava Flav, but Scott Ian also fills on vocal duties (and doesn't sound half bad!) on a verse or two! A remake better than an original classic? How I wish I could see this live!\n\n'Keep It In The Family' and 'Belly of the Beast' translate very well to the live setting, as Anthrax speed them up, giving them a heightened sense of urgency and emotion. I've always found it strange why they put these songs on here, as Joey is literally untouchable in bringing a real energy to the songs. Since the band were no doubt planning to kick him before their final decision, it feels like their trying to say... 'Here's Joey. He's great right? But we can do so much better!'. Whether or not they did do any better, will be covered in my 'Sound of White Noise' review.\n\nThe original tracks, 'Startin' Up A Posse' and 'N.F.B.' are generally nothing to write home about. 'Startin'...' is a trying-to-be-funny anti-censorship song, full of swearing and sound samples of porn which just seems a bit cheap in my opinion. 'N.F.B.' or 'Dallabnukifesin' is a dumbass parody of metal ballads, sung rather effectively by Belladonna, but totally ruined by the fact Anthrax (without Joey or Dan Spitz) would record one for real not long after.\n\nAnd then there's the trash. A few things about 'I'm the Man': it was one of the earliest rap-metal songs, the EP went platinum (!) and it was generally intended as a joke. A joke. 'I'm the Man '91' exists to piss on Anthrax's legacy as fun and goofy by taking the innocent, light-hearted original and making it serious! It ruins the whole point of the song! What you end up with is a stale, bitter end of an era. Anthrax aren't fun anymore. What's most depressing about this remake, is that the line mentioning Joey ('Joey mailed the mail, the mail he mailed!') is cut completely, so you can't even enjoy it as some cheap nostalgia, purely because the band refuses to acknowledge their soon-to-be-kicked 5th member.\n\nAll in all, an essential purchase for Anthrax fans ('Attack...' went gold too!), even if two or three songs are amongst the band's worst. If you're a fan desperate for some more Joey-era Anthrax beyond the four studio albums, here's something worthwhile, if you can stand the foreshadowing atmosphere.\n",
        "\nPulling themselves up off the ground after the critics slated 'State of Euphoria' (although their fanbase pushed sales to gold!), Anthrax released an even darker, but musically superior album in 'Persistence of Time'. As much as I like 'State...', I feel as though carrying on with the sound they developed on that album would have led to an even drier, simpler album that fans would find even easier to dislike. But thankfully that wasn't the case.\n\nBecause... the guitars are back! After being pushed to the sidelines on the last album, Scotty and Dan emerge to drive this album with a tone that is literally one of the heaviest I've heard in all my metal listening years. It's an insane crunch, which provides a thick layer of groove on lower strings but sounds straight up evil on higher strings. But tone means nothing without riffs, and considering the band didn't give us any particularly special ones on the last album (Finale excluded), is there any hope for 'Persistence...'? What can I say? This is a collection of some of thrash metal's meanest riffs! From the groove-thrash of that wicked descending intro/chorus riff in 'Blood', to the moshable breakdown of 'Discharge', these riffs are yet again rhythmically engaging as much as they are melodically! The intro for 'Time' is just one note, hammered repeatedly in 7/4 time, but is so damn catchy that I'll be darned if you don't find holes in the floor or family members after beating out the rhythm with your feet/fist/head! You know that cool circular dance Scott Ian does onstage, where he spins around and stomps whilst still managing to keep hold of his guitar? 'Time' is the perfect soundtrack for that.\n\nIt really has to be heard to be believed. Seven of these 11 tracks are amongst thrash's most glorious moments, and the biggest surprise is how stylistically dissimilar some of these songs are. 'Blood' features rapping in the pre-chorus, and Joey doesn't sound half bad doing it either! 'Keep It In The Family' is a slow, progressive piece, where the sharp rhythms and vicious riffs seem to transcend ordinary thrash, making a song that goes on for just over 7 minutes leave you wanting more. I usually dislike long songs, but the song is driven by such a dark intensity, it's impossible to turn it off. It effortlessly combines about 8 different riffs, each one so wonderfully catchy, so impressively heavy, so goddamn engaging I might just declare it Anthrax's best song!\n\n'Belly of the Beast' is introduced by the epic instrumental 'Intro to Reality', which beings a calm, warm daydream, slowly increasing in intensity as the layers of guitars multiply, before a storm-like climax and a drop. The subsequent riff is amongst my favourite, to listen to and to play. It has an Irish Jig-like quality, only played by Dan Spitz backed by a chugging rhythm guitar making sure it doesn't sound as corny as you might think. The motiff (originally ascending and descending on the G string with B-C-Db-D) then gets used as the middle-eight, adequately transposed for the E string using the chromatic run of Ab-A-Bb-B. This is just about the most melodic Anthrax has ever gotten, and I sort of wish they'd released more stuff like this, because I really enjoy it. They use this riff alone to introduce 'Belly...' live (one of the best versions can be heard on 'Attack of the Killer B's') which I hope to see them play someday. 'Belly...' itself is a brooding piece calling out those countless Nazi soliders that were 'just following orders' (orders, which included having Jews murdered in gas chambers) as heartless cowards, who chose their own safety over what their conscience was telling them, choosing to kill innocent people rather than fight the madness that engulfed them. It's basically a metal companion to the Ramones' anti-Reagan anthem 'Bonzo Goes to Bitburg', also despairing over the rising number of apologetics that pollute our air even to this day (search Nizkor Project for the ultimate rebuttal if you ever encounter such vermin).\n\nJoey Belladonna delivers a fiery and diverse vocal performance on 'Persistence...'. You'll find him rapping on 'Discharge' and 'Blood', sounding like a young punk on the Joe Jackson cover 'Got The Time' (my friends didn't believe it was the same singer) or supplying some of his more familiar melodic harmonies on songs like 'One Man Stands' (a tribute to 'Tank Man', the man standing in front of the tanks in that famous picture from the Tiananmen Square protests) and 'Keep It In The Family' (apparently based on the racial tension in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, which escalated after the tragic murders of three black teenagers during the 80's). He makes the best of some quite terrible lyrics too:\n\n'Raging like a bull inside a cage,\nJust give me a stage,\nWhere this bull can rage!'\n\nBut thankfully his voice doesn't punctuate them the way John Bush's would (and does), and they're easily swept away with the next riff or the chorus. I particularly like the way Joey's accent is allowed to bleed through his vocals, resulting in an almost urban-like fury, which I feel strengthens the lyrics and themes we're presented with. Unfortunately, the growing tension inside the band gives the bitter but seemingly harmless songs 'H8 Red' and 'Gridlock' a depressing hidden meaning. The second verse of 'Gridlock' is most telling:\n\n'I like to keep my friends around me close,\nBut my enemies closer,\nFriends accept me for just who I am,\nNot someone I'm supposed to be,\nOr something they expect for free.'\n\nAfter all the conflicts these guys have had over the years, that verse sounds more than ever as though Joey, with foresight, knew he was going to be kicked out, even before he got the call. Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention. This is Joey Belladonna's last Anthrax album. [Edit: he's since rejoined for the band's latest: 'Worship Music']\n\nScott and Charlie always chalk it up to the fact that their label didn't want a thrash band anymore, and getting rid of him was a step towards pleasing 'the man'. Fans saw it as the ultimate betrayal, removing one of the most recognisable singers in thrash metal all for the sake of popularity. Others saw it as necessary, a step into the right direction. It's still a major talking point when debating the decline of thrash metal in the early 90's. Ironically for the band, they've never been as popular since Joey left, almost sinking in to total obscurity at the turn of the millenium.\n\nPutting these things aside, the only other criticism I have relates purely to a recording error. The first time I heard 'Time' with headphones on, I heard a strange whistling in one of the verses, which was so unexpected and freaky, I looked around the empty room for the trespassing culprit. At first I assumed it was Charlie accidentally whistling the vocal line when recording the drum track, but I'm told it's a fairly common mistake and a result of the vocal reverb. Hopefully if they ever decide to remaster 'P.o.T.', they'll attempt to remove it.\n\nSo that's 'Persistence of Time'. A shining example of how serious Anthrax could be, without sacrificing interesting melodies (the biggest fault of 'State of Euphoria'). Dan Spitz's solos are better than ever (see 'Time', 'Keep It In The Family', Frankie's bass is much missed (check out his solo in 'Got The Time'), Scott's riffs are without fault, Charlie's drumming is impressive yet again and Joey's vocals fits so well amongst all this, which makes it all the worse that it's his last appearance. The amount of riffs, song lengths and variety encorporated on this album seem to have earned it acceptance by fans of progressive metal, who hail it as Anthrax's most technically satisfying album to date. To the average fan, the band were merely back at the top of their game, especially with now classics like 'Time', 'Keep It In The Family', 'In My World' & 'Got the Time'. They believed the only way was up. Then Joey got kicked.\n",
        "\nHere it is, the least liked of all albums Anthrax released during their 'classic' line-up. I can definately see why - that cover is a bit... trippy, the music seems simplified, isn't as fast and doesn't seem to have any real winners on it after 'Antisocial'. It didn't exactly split fans, hell, this went gold just like the last album and the next, but it will probably never be considered to be their best. Personally, I find this album is a blast once you adjust to the tweaks Anthrax made to their sound.\n\nStraight off, the opener, 'Be All, End All', is introduced with a freaking cello! Who do they think they are? They call themselves thrash? (blah blah blah). It's a nice (if a little strange) addition to an already brilliant song, and when I first picked up this album, I honestly thought they'd be incorporating the cello into every song on the album. But don't expect anything else like that on 'State...'.\n\nThe music on this album is often called 'boring', but I think it's just the step down to simpler riffs & song structures that put a few people off. Here the band stripped down their sound to rely on pounding rhythms and percussion, whilst the guitars take a more conservative role in the overall makeup of the album. This means the production had to change too, to focus on the energy of the drums rather than the bite of the guitars. And there is TONS of energy here - the drums are masterfully produced, and could be my favourite of any 80's thrash. The dryness can make the album a little tiring at times, because there isn't as much brightness (the cymbals & hi-hats are less prominant) to counteract the low end (something I think they get right on their next effort, 'Persistence of Time'), but it's still an interesting listening experience. I sometimes feel Metallica could have learnt a few things from Anthrax at the time, and an album like '...And Justice For All' could've been much more listenable, but I'll cover that band's problems elsewhere.\n\nThe drumming is thrash heaven, up there with the best of Gary Samuelson & Nick Menza for Megadeth and Dave Lombardo of Slayer. I don't know who had most control over the album in the songwriting department (it just says 'Anthrax'), but it's so drum-centric that it almost totally overshadows the rest of the instruments. But I honestly don't know enough about drumming to comment further, although I still think this impressive stuff - it would keep most metal drummers captivated I'm sure.\n\nJoey Belladonna actually sounds very comfortable providing the vocals here. He's forced to sing lower than on previous albums, but his voice doesn't become goofy or weak like you'd expect. In fact, he sings with a lot of heart, making musically unimpressive songs like 'Who Cares Wins' and 'Out of Sight, Out of Mind' truly kick ass. It's actually one of his strongest vocal performances, despite the pressure drumer Charlie and guitarist Scott were putting him under at the time (those guys were dicks, let's face it).\n\nThis album is let down by Anthrax's uncharacteristically bitter tone. I appreciate they integrated more 'Indians' like social commentary in to their lyrics - a true sign of their punk roots - but the darker subjects covered here seem to detract from their ability to create pleasing music. 'Indians' had that riff, those drums, those vocals, and seems to offer a simple solution to the issues raised in the lyrics: mosh. But 'Schism', for example, doesn't even have a chorus...?! Or is that what 'Schism!... Schism! Ska ska ska schism!' is supposed to be? There's virtually no climax before this faux-chorus, and it just seems like a different section of another verse. This problem isn't uncommon on this album. Thankfully they strike a better balance on their next album, 'Persistence...', in particular with winners like 'Keep It In The Family' and 'One Man Stands'.\n\nThe guitars are mere rhythmic support on 'State...', as the album is mostly a tug of war between bitter vocals and pumping drums. 'Be All, End All', 'Antisocial' (everyones heard this one) and 'Finale' stand tall as crowd favourites, the former two songs appearing in Anthrax's setlist more often than not, whilst hardcore fans will be pleased by darker songs like the Stephen King-inspired 'Misery Loves Company' and anti-televangelist 'Make Me Laugh'. In my personal opinion, whilst this album is a overloaded with its dry and gloomy songs, I feel this was a neccessary and interesting step from the lighthearted thrash of 'Among the Living' to the darker still (but musically superior) 'Persistence of Time'. In short: I enjoy the heck out of 'State of Euphoria', but only when I'm in the mood.\n",
        "\nI can imagine a lot of people hearing this song in combination with the name \u2018Anthrax\u2019 throwing away their headphones in horror. This ain\u2019t no Gung Ho nor Panic obviously. But try listening to the best of the Bush era without thinking about the glorious eighties. That\u2019s the only way it worked for me. 1993-2003 Bushthrax is just a different entity. \n\nI\u2019ve said it before in my WCFYA review, Safe Home is Bushthrax\u2019 second best \u2018ballad\u2019. Had it not had that marvellous harmony in the middle it would\u2019ve only been just slightly better than Harm\u2019s Way but that harmony, that\u2019s one of those things I love about metal and rock. Sheer beauty. Also I love the lyrics and chord progression. Simply put, I like this song no matter how much I claim to be an old school thrasher. \n\nWhat makes this single obsolete is that it includes two versions of the same song and one of their worst songs from the WCFYA album (\u2018Taking the Music Back\u2019) so there\u2019s no use to go looking for this if you have WCFYA unless you just wanna collect everything.\n\nSo 80 points for their second best Bushthrax ballad but 0 points for the obsoleteness of this release. 40 it is.\n",
        "\nAfter the very enjoyably \u2018Fight em till you can\u2019t\u2019 Anthrax now release a second tune to warm up things for the upcoming Worship Music album. Honesty compels me to say this second song doesn\u2019t live up to the previous one. Scott already spoke of an AC-DC inspired song in several interviews and here we have it.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun song. It\u2019s a song which would do nicely on an EP. I love Thrax, love Joey and I love Bon Scott era AC-DC but it\u2019s average as best. It could\u2019ve been written shortly after WCFYA since it had a certain Bushthrax rock feeling surrounding it. Not saying this is a bad thing since I love a fair share of Bushtrax songs throughout the years but one would expect something a bit more either classic speed, thrash or even traditional metal from the boys returning to the front with Joey to be on a regular full length.\n\nAll in all this song, Fight \u2019Em and the description of other ones promise a very varied album coming up. Let\u2019s just hope \u2018The Devil You Know\u2019 isn\u2019t one of the better tracks. That\u2019d mean a pretty mediocre album\u2026\n",
        "\nBasically, half way through the 'Among the Living' tour, Anthrax (kitted out in Adidas tracksuits) decided to give their fans an EP as a small thank you for their support during the year of 1987. Since its release, this fun little disc has raised many a metalhead's eyebrow. People who didn't really get Anthrax hated it, saw it as selling out... just couldn't tell it was a joke. The previous review (by morbert) has summed that kind of person up perfectly, so I won't waste space saying virtually the same thing.\n\nWhat you get is 3 different versions of the rap metal song 'I'm The Man' - the originial, a censored version and a live performance. 'I'm The Man' is basically a light-hearted band biography, but the rappers constantly get the words wrong (\"This sound you hear is what we like/and I'll steal your pop tarts like I stole your...\" \"socks!\" \"Yo man what's the matter with you?\" \"I'll get it the next time I promise!\"), with a crazy chorus of 'I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm so bad I should be in detention, I'm the maaan!!' all backed by Dan Spitz playing 'Hava Nagila'. The live performance is just as hilarious, and you really get a sense of the connection between Anthrax and their fans: having the fans scream 'JOEY FUCKED UP!!' halfway through the song, and then call them mean for saying so. The censored version is really unnecessary, but makes sense to have played on the radio or at clubs.\n\nConsidering it's just a quickly recorded EP, the cover of 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' is really good, and it makes me think how awesome it would have been to hear Anthrax do a 'Garage Days' type covers album. With a bit more money and longer time in the studio, they could have made atleast a kickass EP of great covers.\n\nThe live tracks are great, 'Caught In A Mosh' being the best. It is definately one of my favourite live versions of the song, because it really demonstrates their energy and tightness live, fronted by an on-top-form Joey. I think I find the snare too distracting in 'I Am The Law', but that's down to the recording, and it is still a fine performance.\n\nIt's essential for a true Anthrax fan to get this EP, even if just for the title track and the Sabbath cover, even if to prove to you that rap metal can be good. This was an awesome statement to make in a time when rap and metal seemed destined to hate eachother, and for that Anthrax deserve much respect from both sides.\n",
        "\nAs a big fan of the legendary and unforgettable Twin Peaks series by David Lynch, there were two main reasons why I wanted to check this album out. My first contact with Anthrax was in fact the video clip for \"Only\" where I recognized the actor Frank Silva which gave me a big jolt and made me remember my childhood nightmares and appreciation of the best evil personality ever portrayed on television which was BOB from Twin Peaks. When I further checked out this album, I learned that the band collaborated with the composer of the series' brilliant soundtrack which is Angelo Badalamenti fr the song \"Black Lodge\" which had another Twin Peaks' influenced title and clip. That's when I decided to check the entire album out.\n\nWhat I quickly realized is that the two first songs I checked out are easily the best on the record. \"Only\" is described as the perfect song by Metallica's James Hetfield. I wouldn't go as far but it's a truly catchy track with great vocals, a dark grunge riff and a nice short and sweet guitar solo. \"Black Lodge\" is a smooth and experimental track that sounds very slow and lazy and needs some time to grow but it surely is an interesting experiment without having the magic of the composition that were made for Twin Peaks.\n\nThe rest of the record falls off the edge. Anthrax play mostly the same dark grunge riffs on the entire record and goes away from the thrash and heavy metal roots of the band. Tracks such as \"Hy Pro Glo\" or \"Burst\" remind of a weird mixture of influences such as White Zombie and Metallica with some Voivod, Alice In Chains Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers sounds. The band even used the same producer as Alice In Chains did at the time. The final result is quite close to the grunge and crossover genre where only the dark vibes of some weird intros remind of a slightly progressive thrash style. As many big names of the metal industry, Anthrax also changed their style and tried out something new to go with the time and gather a certain popularity. Back in the years, Twin Peaks and grunge music were two important parts of a barnd new cultural phenomenon in the United States of America and Anthrax worked with them and used them. The band even went further. The bad single choice \"Hy Pro Glo\" is influenced by a television commercial and the experimental and slightly interesting album closer \"This Is Not An Exit\" is a tribute to the \"American Psycho\" novel that came out around the same time. That's maybe not extremely entertaining and courageous but it worked back then as the album got the highest American chart position ever for any Anthrax release.\n\nThe album didn\u2019t age very well though and feels a little bit too nostalgic and assimilated to the trends of the early nineties today. Most of the songs sound worn out and closed minded today. I could only cite \"Only\" as a great song that still works well in the present time and one hit out of eleven tries is not a great average at all. Even if like Twin Peaks and crossover music, this album deserves a rather low rating from an objective point of view and is a popular and sad example for the downfall and the assimilation of the metal genre in the nineties.\n",
        "\nAnthrax. One of those love hate bands. I know people who worship Anthrax and others who think Anthrax are the worse \"thrash\" band to walk the earth. I happen to be a big fan of Anthrax, and, as all Anthrax fans, have been waiting for them to put out new songs FOREVER. Their first song released from Worship Music was Fight Em Till You Can't, which is a good song, but uses the exact same riffs as Gridlock. It's basically Gridlock with better sound quality, so it didn't impress me. \n\nI just listened to The Devil You Know this morning, and I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised. Joey didn't sound strained at all, and the riffs were great. There's also a solo a little past the middle of the song that's great as well. The lyrics are ok, although a bit cheesy. Unfortunately, the bass goes along with the guitar, but still adds a nice background to the whole thing. Charlie is very solid on the drums as usual. \n\nWith that said, this song does have some faults. The chorus is good, but it's been done a million times. It sounds almost mainstream, and it's extremely generic. The lyrics are also generic. The riffs aren't very creative either. It can get boring after a while.\n\nOverall, I liked the song, although they could have been more creative with it. I also like the Dio support as well m/ honoring the vocal god is great. I think Anthrax's new album is going to be really solid, so I can't wait for September\n",
        "\nAfter being lifted to cloud 9 to the sweet sounds of Anthrax\u2019s undeniable return to form \u201cFight \u2018Em Till You Can\u2019t\u201d, I decided to come back down to earth when approaching the second single of the soon to be unleashed \u201cWorship Music\u201d. My return to a more measured composure turned out to be warranted, though the results are not by any means a dismissal of this song as a remnant of the band\u2019s less than spectacular run with John Bush. \u201cThe Devil You Know\u201d is definitely cut from a slightly different grain than the first single, but it is not entirely out of character for a band that is rediscovering their lost thrash roots.\n\nWhile slower and definitely of a more groovy persuasion, this is a song that could have been heard on \u201cState Of Euphoria\u201d or \u201cPersistence Of Time\u201d. The principle riff contains a similar simplicity to that of a number of albums that were leading the pack between 1988-1991, perhaps most resembling a couple of the better songs on Metallica\u2019s infamous 1991 commercial breakthrough album such as \u201cHolier Than Thou\u201d and \u201cThrough The Never\u201d. It\u2019s mid-tempo, it has a fair amount of fancy drum work surrounding a fairly basic guitar and bass progression, but this is definitely not a full out regression into the horrid world of \u201cStomp 442\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019ve Come For You All\u201d.\n\nPerhaps the key player in this song making all the needed waves to keep expectations of the soon coming return album optimistic is the vocal presence of Joey Belladonna. Possessing a clean cut and fairly predictable range, he does a decent job of injecting just the right amount of grit and attitude to keep this song from sounding too tame and the occasional gang chorus chime-ins definitely keep the Anthrax signature fully displayed. One shouldn\u2019t be too quick to dismiss the lead work of Rob Caggiano either, as the lead display on here is about as polished and flashy as can be for a song that hearkens to a time in thrash where simplicity and accessibility was becoming more fundamental.\n\nIn short, definitely not the best song I\u2019ve heard out of this band, but worthy of the name and the perceived trend back towards a worthiness for inclusion in the media creation known as the Big 4. There is still always the possibility that \u201cWorship Music\u201d will turn out to be a dud with a couple of decent songs on it, but the likelihood of it is diminishing bit by bit with every released bit and piece. Now the question becomes, if Scott Ian can make time to break from the MTV interviews and excessive touring on past glory to write some solid material, what the hell is preventing James Hetfield from getting his act together?\n",
        "\nThat artwork. Is there anything more metal than that? This is Anthrax's reply to Metallica's 'Kill 'Em All' and Slayer's 'Show No Mercy', and so you'd expect it to be full of dirty, thrash metal gems that still find their way into the band's setlist now and again. Unfortunately you'd be wrong, and whilst the music is pretty kicking, 'Fistful of Metal' is on the whole a forgettable little thing, outclassed by pretty much everything the band ever did afterwards.\n\nThe problem with this album exists purely with the singer. Neil Turbin certainly has a set of lungs on him, and his range is almost worthy of Rob Halford himself, but he lacks any character whatsoever. For instance, a song as simple as 'I'm Eighteen' (a cover of a great Alice Cooper song) needs the vocals to shine, to make the lyrics reach out to the listener. Whilst the rest of the band have interpretated the music quite well, Turbin supplies zero life to it, and the song ends up feeling as faceless as a bad Kiss song.\n\nAnd as for his screaming... well. Screaming should be used sparingly and only when neccessary, to emphasize a climax, or punctuate a verse or chorus. But Turbin's constantly screaming (he can really scream) throughout the album, and I always finish listening to the album thinking there were more screams than actual singing. Again, this is down to the fact that when Turbin isn't screaming, his voice is so frustratingly boring and generic that apart from the simple and silly verses of 'Metal Thrashing Mad' and a chorus or two ('Jet FIGHTER!! Jet FIGHTER!'), you won't remember a damn thing he's sung.\n\nIn all fairness, the rest of the band can sink into sheer mediocrity at times, and is only ever saved by Dan Spitz. 'Panic' is a good example, a fairly standard speed metal track, transformed in the second half to a melodic-as-dick-catchy-as-a-pokeball joyride. Spitz is let totally loose on 'Fistful...', without the apparent parameters of later albums. Whilst he's still piddling about with pentatonics and stuff (the kind that just kill an atmosphere of a song, see 'Damage Inc.'), to someone used to hearing Danny's later more melodic/vicious/Judas Priest-type solos, it's a real nice to hear that he could do wankery-ass Hammett stuff if he wanted, but that just wasn't his style.\n\nSadly, the production really doesn't hold up well, and there's an unnatural amount of reverb on here that really amplifies the drums (which didn't need anymore encouragment to get louder), so the snare is insanely tight and loud throughout, and the symbols never seem to stop crashing. It's quite an unpleasant sharp sound which just soaks through the rest of the instruments as though the band recorded the thing live in studio and didn't take any care in adjusting the bleed through each microphone.\n\nSo the album doesn't ever really live up to its cover. Yes it's primitive, very very fast & heavy, and those solos are a blast, but 'Fistful of Metal' is let down by what now seems like amateur production and some soulless vocals. Besides the essential crowd favourites, 'Metal Thrashing Mad' and 'Deathrider', the rest is take it or leave it.\n",
        "\n'Armed and Dangerous' is a genuine classic. It marries melody, vicious riffs & damn fine singing resulting in the earliest example of Anthrax breaking away from the speed metal silliness of Fistful of Metal and creating a name for themselves with thrash. Unfortunately, just like the rest of this EP, this recording is washed over with too much reverb, making it much less enjoyable than the version on the 'Spreading the Disease'. Oops, I just left slip this EP's biggest flaw. Unless you live in 1985, this release is worthless to you: the best song on this thing would appear on their next album. You're best off spending money on the essential 'Spreading the Disease'.\n\nBasically, there's not much here that'll excite you. 'Raise Hell' is by far Anthrax's worst song with Joey. It's the lowest of the low in terms of riffs and lyrics ('I'm on fire, can't hold back my desireeee!') and Joey's vocal melodies are so overdone it sounds like he's warming up for a better songs (but then perhaps that's the analogy). To clarify, if 'Raise Hell' had been the title track, fans would've been crapping their leather pants over what 'Spreading the Disease' would sound like. The cover 'God Save the Queen' isn't too bad, and it's better than Megadeth's Sex Pistols cover because a) the lyrics are actually right and b) it's not useless filler on an otherwise great album. It doesn't really suit the band (especially Kiss/Rush influenced Joey) but it's cool to hear a band's influences, and Dan Spitz's weird ass solo is umm... interesting.\n\nThe live tracks are okay although I they're definately live in the studio rather than live at a show, and those rare tracks are basically slower, poorly recorded versions of mediocre songs from 'Fistful of Metal' from a 1983 7\".\n\nI'd rate the EP higher if it wasn't for that huge amount of reverb all over it - it dates the music terribly.\n",
        "\nI don't want to mention any of the band's recent history. Look it up yourself, formulate your own opinions. All I can say is Belladonna is the classic singer, and after all the shit that gone flying around in the last few years I'm glad something good came out of it all. Specifically, this song.\n\nFirst of all, the production is huge. The drums are full of that all important energy, and the hi hats and crash cymbals give the song that great high-end that would seem at home on a Dead Kennedys album. The EQ has most in common with Megadeth's 'Endgame', which, whilst not my favourite release by them, was in my opnion the better produced of the newest Big Four albums. However, two things set Fight'em 'til you Can't apart from 'Endgame': the range of frequencies and the clarity of the instruments. Listening to the song through studio headphones, it has captured a wider sound - the kick drum sits as a clear foundation of low-end for which the guitars, snare and vocals can occupy their own small, but snug section of lowish-mid frequencies. The cymbals and hi-hat provide just the right amount of bright high frequencies, stopping you from feeling overpowered. One aspect of Megadeth's latest release that I had a minor gripe with was the squeezing of all instruments into the mid frequencies, with minimal low end, and a toned down high end. I remember it left me feeling a little underwhelmed. I did not feel that way here, as my heart was literally left pumping with the energy of the song, I felt like I could listen to it again and again. The clarity of the guitar is a nice improvement over the cloudy guitars I felt let down Anthrax's previous album 'We've Come For You All' and the above mentioned 'Endgame'. The riffs are better defined and have a more satisfying crunch, similar to older Thrax tunes like 'A Skeleton In The Closet' or 'Hy Pro Glo'.\n\nLyric-wise, the song is a nice nod to what made Anthrax so fun back in the 80's... it's about killing zombies.\nThe way the vocals have been arranged makes me visualize vocalist Belladonna being the world weary but determined protagonist of a zombie comic book, with guitarist Scott Ian's bellowing passages offering some sort of narration, whilst bassist Frankie Bello provides the vocal harmonies to add flavour to the story and makes it catchy as heck. Speaking of catchiness, I'll be singing Joey's 'I'll End You!!!!' section of the pre-chorus for weeks.\n\nIn terms of style, this is quite clearly a marriage of old school Anthrax thrash (think 'Among the Living' or 'Persistence of Time'), with the newer, more modern approach ('We've Come for You All'). Thanks to this new production, the drums are pounding like never before, with those brilliant Benante-trademark blast beats and double bass pedalling. The bass guitar is rather quiet throughout the song, but can be heard just below the other guitars, thundering out the rhythm. As previously mentioned, the guitars have a wicked crunching tone that as a guitarist I really envy - that's exactly the kind of sound I want to produce. The solo, whilst not groundbreaking, provides that little bit of hope: what all good zombie stories must have. (Except in reality, the hope has been that Anthrax can succeed with their next album. It's looking good so far).\n\nIt has been said that the chorus is a little bit too 'pop' for some peoples tastes, but I think it's optimism contrasts nicely with the bleak verses/pre-choruses. I think it's a nod to what I mentioned above, the marriage of two styles of Anthrax. No doubt I'll have this blasting out loud in my car, or at home when it arrives physically, it's just such a great for the summer.\n\nFinally, the artwork is just awesome: the five members of the band attacking their zombified versions of themselves. Drummer Charlie Benante stabbing his zombie with his drum sticks, Bello's trying to pull his blood covered arm out of the torso of his, Scott Ian punching his zombified self through the throat, lead guitarist Rob locked in a choking wrestle with his undead copy, and my favourite: Joey busting his zombie's jaw wide open and aiming another punch. Like the front of a grusome comic book, it is perfect for the theme of the song.\n\nJust as I do in this review, this single is already being compared to the newest offerings of Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer. And why not? Anthrax are a part of the Big Four and have just as much to live up to. Thankfully, this single proves they can do it. And do it very, very well.\n",
        "\nI have never been that much into Anthrax. Maybe because I just got into metal music around 2005 when they were less popular and faced many complicated struggles. Maybe because I just adored thrash metal bands like \"Overkill\" and \"Voivod\" and from time to time some \"Metallica\" so that I didn't feel the need to look further. I never really understood why Anthrax was part of the so called \"Big Four\" and not \"Overkill\" or \"Exodus\" for example. Now those guys are back and I begin to understand why.\n\nThere were many strong thrash metal records in the last years coming from established acts such as \"Heathen\" or \"Overkill\" and also more recent bands like \"Acrassicauda\" but \"Anthrax\" show us here with their first single in years that they are back and can deliver something as strong as the bands mentioned above. I'm beginning to get slowly into their music and I'm looking forward for the new album right now.\n\nThe song has everything a great thrash metal track needs. We have a few sharp guitar riffs, a tight drumming and a solid bass guitar that fuses and supports the whole structure and also great aggressive but still melodic shouts and vocals in here. A great sample introduction and many changes of pace and style including a really catchy chorus are also included. Some vocal and sound effects as well as the commercial chorus give a fresh and modern sound to the band. The cover artwork fits perfectly to the song and pleases much more to me than the actual album artwork for \u201cWorship Music\u201d. Some people might judge this sound too trendy and not edgy enough, but I'm happy that the band tries out something different and has arrived in the year 2011 instead of just copying their old standards. The song is a truly diversified and yet catchy grower and probably the best song and single of its kind in the year of our Lord 2011. But it still simply doesn't beat the classics and some recent works of the concurrency again. But this time at least, \"Anthrax\" justifies its status and actually gets quite close.\n\n\"Anthrax\" is still not amongst my favourite bands but with this comeback they have surely risen in my estimation and overall surprised me with this solid new single. It's a wonder that the phoenix has come back from its ashes and I hope watching him fly high.\n",
        "\nAfter over 20 years of being pissed off at how the entire Big 4 all but totally crashed and burned after 1990, taking most of the great world of thrash metal with them, I can say with full confidence now that 3 out 4 are back on their game. I\u2019m not sure if it was the recent death of the iconic metal god Ronnie James Dio that inspired it, or just a sudden realization that Anthrax needs to do something meaningful before all is said and done, but it is now official. Joey Belladonna is back, completely on his game, and with him is the original powerhouse that gave us \u201cPersistence Of Time\u201d, literally as if \u201cSound Of White Noise\u201d and the rest of the musical abortions that followed it never occurred. The presence of Dan Spitz is missed a little, but ultimately Rob Caggiano is a competent enough to act as stand in, though to be frank, this band\u2019s power was always more in their songwriting and vocal delivery than any sort of signature shredding routine more suited to Megadeth or Slayer.\n\nThe long and short of it is, \u201cFight\u2019em \u2018Til You Can\u2019t\u201d is a nasty riff monster that keeps it simple, invoking a sound reminiscent both of Belladonna\u2019s traditional rock/metal roots and the hardcore/punk aspects that fed into the early thrash scene. Scott Ian all but shares lead vocal duties with Joey during the chorus, putting the emphasis on a gritty, punchy gang chorus sound that provides the perfect foil for Belladonna\u2019s cleaner, tuneful vocals. The riff set is somewhat restrained and slowed down, reminding heavily of the well renowned \u201cPersistence Of Time\u201d tune \u201cGridlock\u201d, but with a few more fancy drum tricks and a somewhat fancier guitar solo. In fact, I\u2019d venture to argue that Benante all but pushes himself into equal prominence with Ian\u2019s riffs and the vocals. But more than anything, this song just succeeds on being catchy as hell and a partial throwback to a time in Anthrax\u2019s history much better than what took place after Belladonna left.\n\nThis is the Anthrax that everybody knew and loved, a band that showcased the compatibility between being heavy as a 10 ton tractor trailer without having to completely leave the realm of accessibility. They\u2019re not going to win any awards for piling on the speed and stacking up a massive quantity of riffs the way Sepultura did on \u201cBeneath The Remains\u201d or Vio-Lence did on \u201cEternal Nightmare\u201d, but that\u2019s never what this band has been about. It\u2019s a bit of a bittersweet reunion from the standpoint that Scott Ian has always been capable of creating masterworks like this, but has largely avoided doing so in order to cater to a generation of brain dead MTV drones, but since most of those dumb shits are strung out on shows like Jersey Shore now, it\u2019s safe to say that the incentive is back to get more of where this came from. If this song is any indication of the total contents of \u201cWorship Music\u201d, then we\u2019re all in for a real treat, and hopefully one that will convince Metallica to get off their asses and put out something worthy of their name.\n",
        "\nOf course, Fight \u2018Em isn\u2019t exactly a new song anymore. It was one of the three or four tunes with Dan Nelson on vocals which could be found on youtube and possible a few other places. Since the Big 4 concerts and the return of Joey the band have been playing it live and various live versions have reached the public.\n\nMost notable, apart from the old school feeling, are the elaborate backing vocals by Scott. Good to hear him stompin\u2019 and shouting. In fact, they\u2019re so elaborate they can\u2019t be considered backing anymore. Furthermore the main riff is a bit borrowed from their earlier tune Gridlock but it doesn\u2019t damage the enjoyment. Memorable as well is the good solo/lead by Rob Caggiano which sounds more Anthrax proof than a lot he did on previous Thrax albums.\n\nMusically we hear a lot of old Thrax again. A Euphoria/Persistence atmosphere. This together with the melodic chorus makes it sound like the missing link between Persistence Of Time and, yes, Sound Of White Noise. Indeed they were telling the truth when they said it would be old Anthrax in the 21st century. This is exactly that.\n\nNow what can be said about this new studioversion? Well it\u2019s a bit slower than the versions we already knew and I honestly don\u2019t really like that. Don\u2019t worry, it hasn\u2019t become a bad song all of a sudden but the faster live versions just sound slightly more energetic. Still beats the shit out of the old live versions with Dan Nelson. And that has of course a lot do to with The Return Of The Injun. Welcome back. And he sounds great!\n\nThe artwork is just great. Alex Ross did a superb job and this is the kind of cover that would end up between favourite metal posters and vinyl.\n\nWhat else is there left to say? Here\u2019s hoping the rest of the album will be at least just as good as this. Welcome back boys\n",
        "\nI have never been a huge Anthrax fan, although I always respected them for their impact on the thrash metal genre. That being said, I'm really impressed by this new song. I was curious to hear what these legends had to offer after so many years. Luckily, they still can deliver. This song is enjoyable and is really energetic. It has everything you'd want from your thrash song; thrashing riffs, pounding drumming, furious and angry vocals, an angry chorus and lastly a rather melodic solo. I have to mention the awesome backing vocals; they sound so angry! The guitar work is punishing and the drums sound really decent. The solo is melodic and memorable. The riffs are also quite memorable. The bass is hard to hear, they should turn Frank Bello's bass louder in the mix. That would help the upcoming album sound really better. Joey sounds really good and I must say he sounds better than his live performances. He has probably been taking care of his voice, and that's good for him as he sounds awesomely angry on this one! A special note goes to the radio part at the beginning; it really sets the atmosphere and sounds great just before the galloping riffs that follow it!\n\nThis has raised the expectation bar for the new album really high and I only hope that it will live up to this song and the hype that is being created. This is really solid and promising and I hope the band continues delivering through the years. On top of this, the artwork is really cool; it pictures the band members struggling with their selves. This is just awesome!\n",
        "\nAnd with their new album they're gonna kick your ass, and hard. Not since Belly of the Beast have I enjoyed an Anthrax song so much. After so many delays and not knowing who was going to record the vocals for the damn thing, Scott, Frank, Charlie, Rob and Joey have decided to let us get a tiny glimpse of what is to come on September 13th.\n\nFuck.\n\nThe new song begins with a man talking over the radio, saying \".. the bodies of the dead are rising from their graves and attacking the living\" before Charlie begins pounding away on the drums while Scott and Rob riff away. The intro riff reminds me of the Time riff, but it fits the song perfectly before breaking into the main riff, which sounds slightly less harsher to make way for Joey's voice \"When the dust breaks in!\". it has been a while since I've heard this man sing so angrily. In the chorus we get the single best weapon Anthrax has in their arsenal, one that was kept in check during the John Bush era, waiting to be released for this album. The brutal and angry backing vocals that complement Joey's voice so fucking perfectly! Scott growls away in a very crossover thrash way before Joey comes in to deliver a finishing \"I'll end you!\". Then comes the solo, a very melodic and pumping attack that gives the song a unique sound among the extensive Anthrax discography. The song then ends with that crossover influence chorus one last time.\n\nFight 'Em 'Til You Can't is yet another track that proves that Anthrax was and is still at the top of the thrash food chain, near Sadus, Overkill, Megadeth and Morbid Saint and above Exodus, Slayer, Artillery and Agent Steel.\n\nOh and the single's cover, just click on it... need I say more :D?\n",
        "\nSo as to reduce any suggestion of impropriety, I'll come out and say it immediately: I still have yet to find any work by Anthrax that I can find tolerable, much less 'good.' They are without a doubt my least favorite of the big 4 of thrash (and since I only like one of them anyway, that does mean something) and throughout their career do nothing but release album after album which I find either interminably boring at best or actively offensive to my senses at worst. I have a horrible relationship with the band and I'm still to this day incredulous that people actually enjoy them unironically.\n\nI can't even pinpoint what it is about Anthrax that I viciously hate so much apart from how feeble and also-ran all of their material is. Of the big 4, I enjoy Slayer but basically dislike everything by Megadeth and Metallica, but at the same time, it's very easy for me to see how horrifically outclassed Anthrax is by the double Ms. Does anyone really make the argument that Anthrax can stand up to any other major thrash band from the '80s on a musical level? Slayer obliterates all of Anthrax's attempts at heaviness, Megadeth murders them on a technical level, and even Metallica robs them of the crown of pure songwriting capability. So what does that leave Anthrax with? A ton of irritating ninth-string thrash albums solely remembered and listened to by the same sort of people who are convinced Exodus will turn it around one day? They do nothing, the only thing they ever influenced were the worst and dumbest parts of thrash, and they've contributed nothing to the metal scene today apart from Scott Ian chewing the scenery on VH1 specials.\n\nWith that out of the way: 'Fistful of Metal.' I guess the most important thing to state about this is really that it's more of a power/thrash album than a straight thrash record; the influence from NWOBHM and oldschool speed metal is palpable, with Judas Priest a clearly relevant part of the whole package. With riffs that sound carved from the fastest parts of Iron Maiden's early, punk-influenced catalog, 'Fistful of Metal' is the most overtly traditional of Anthrax's discography, setting it far apart from contemporaries like Slayer who were busy pushing the boundaries of speed and aggression. Anthrax, on the other hand, seemed more inclined to simply rock out with oldschool heavy metal heavily influenced by both rock and NWOBHM. Apart from some concessions to double bass and slightly more intense tracks like 'Metal Thrashing Mad,' arguing this album as an instrumental one in the establishment of thrash would definitely be a hard sell. For the most part, the material on this disc is softer than anything on 'Kill 'Em All' or any other heavy hitter from the same era.\n\nIt's probably due to this that, rather unsurprisingly, 'Fistful of Metal' has aged worse than the debut albums of any others in the big 4. A primary offender are the vocals of Neil Turbin, who apes the big vocal names of NWOBHM but without the necessary power or natural talent to successfully replicate the style, making them come off as whiny, mush-mouthed, and ragged (and not in a good way.) Of course, the rest of the package doesn't exactly stand the test of time either- the instrumentation tends to be sluggish, lazy, and relatively unadorned, with long stretches of unbroken instrumental repetition padding out the running time excessively, 'Death From Above' being a prime example. For the most part it just sounds juvenile and easily outclassed by just about any other record from the same time. I'm really at a loss as to how Anthrax managed to keep momentum after this release when more obviously skilled members of the same scene might have floundered for a few years before consolidating their grip on the underground. These guys should have been the first to bow out of the race, but somehow, thirty years later, they're still around.\n\nMy interest in this is purely historical and my prejudices against this style of happy thrash are well known, so don't take my opinions as anything reasonable. Still, though, I can only guess as to what others hear in stuff like this- maybe this was good enough back in '84 (though I doubt it,) but we're definitely past this now. Just about anything from the same era was better from this, but I have no doubt a copy of this resides in your collection like a canker sore even then.\n",
        "\nHaving decided to travel to Warsaw, Poland, to be at the inaugural \u2018Big 4\u2019 event I was eagerly anticipating the release of this boxset, not least because as a vertically challenged individual I was able to see very little from my position 300 yards back at Bemowo Airport on that historic day in mid-2010.\n\nThis release, the deluxe boxset which includes CD and DVD recordings of all four bands, would enable me to watch the show in Sofia in sharp detail which I had no hope of when in a crowd of near 100,000 in Warsaw.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t disappoint. The item itself is nicely put together, although I would have been happy to pay \u00a320 ($31) for the CDs and DVDs without the poster, guitar pick, photos, booklet etc for which I ended up paying \u00a345 ($70). Sturdy, well made and a good piece of metal memorabilia.\n\nBut what about the performances? Well first up is Anthrax, the band which, arguably, held onto their spot in the Big 4 by the skin of their teeth throughout the mid-80s. Some would argue for Exodus, though on the strength of five great albums from 1985 to 1990 I would have chosen Kreator but then a European band would never make the Big 4!\n\nAnthrax\u2019s rough and ready debut, Fistful Of Metal lead on to two great albums \u2013 the ground breaking Spreading The Disease, and the hyperspeed/mosh orgy of Among The Living. These were the albums that Anthrax secured their place in the Big 4 with. Of course, they released two more well respected, if not particularly well received, albums after these. So this leads to a fundamental question \u2013 why, in a set of ten songs, do Anthrax choose to play two covers - Joe Jackson\u2019s \u2018Got The Time\u2019 and Trust\u2019s \u2018Antisocial\u2019? Plus a shortened cover of \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019 by the band of the same name?\n\nWhile Anthrax are fun to watch onstage and put in a good performance musically and physically (including Joey Belladonna\u2019s strained vocals) to play two full covers in a ten song set is unforgiveable when tracks like \u2018Among The Living\u2019 and \u2018Gung Ho\u2019 were overlooked. Add to this the addition of \u2018Only\u2019, a song from an era of Anthrax that most grunge fans will enjoy and most thrash fans cringe at, and \u2018Medusa\u2019, one of the weakest, most commercial tracks from Spreading... and you have the makings of a poor set.\n\nAnthrax\u2019s enthusiasm cannot be questioned here, but their set list raises big questions for me as to whether they really understood the significance of this occasion.\n\nNext up \u2013 Megadeth. Put simply, on this performance and that in Poland, Megadeth are THE band to see at the moment. Very, very well produced sound, maybe the best sound I have ever heard on a live recording. Incredible musicianship. Mustaine and Broderick are tight as fuck on guitar duty; Newly, and rightfully, reinstated Dave Ellefson is excellent on bass guitar with his tight picked rhythms nicely high in the mix. Shawn Drover\u2019s drumming is flawless, and while you won\u2019t hear Nick Menza\u2019s powerhouse beats or Gar Samuelson\u2019s (RIP) syncopated jazz-influenced flamboyancy, what you do get is a totally heavy bass-drum driven barrage.\n\nThe set is just what was needed after Anthrax\u2019s weak start \u2013 opener \u2018Holy Wars...\u2019 giving way to \u2018Hangar 18\u2019, followed by \u2018Peace Sells...\u2019. After that comes nine more great songs, including a rousing rendition of \u2018A Tout le Monde\u2019. Absolutely fucking brilliant performance from a great band.\n\nSo how do you follow that? One word. Slayer.\n\nShould Slayer have played after Megadeth? It\u2019s arguable. On album performance over the last 27 years, yes. On their respective performances on the night, no, Megadeth ruled. But Slayer is Slayer. What you see is what you get. If, like me, Slayer is your favourite band ever and you have seen Slayer play on any number of occasions (last count maybe 15 times) then you know what you\u2019re in for, and this was no different. Pure fucking heads down aggression from start to finish.\n\nSlayer regularly mix their set up show by show and this one, sadly, contained nothing from Show No Mercy or Hell Awaits. However, \u2018War Ensemble\u2019, \u2018Hate Worldwide\u2019, \u2018Chemical Warfare\u2019 and the obligatory \u2018Raining Blood\u2019 will surely have given many of the newbie Metallica kids a headache.\n\nAs always, Hanneman and King are solid but raw and somewhat sloppy. The sound and mix are unforgiving on this recording for the guitar duo. Tom\u2019s vocals are good but still show signs of inexorable decline. On a couple of occasions he misses lyrics having invited the crowd to sing them. James Hetfield can do this in an arena this size, Tom can\u2019t, the response isn\u2019t loud enough. If you\u2019re watching the DVD it is apparent why there\u2019s no vocals but if you\u2019re listening to the CD then it sounds a little lame.\n\nThe stand out performance with Slayer is Dave Lombardo. He is superb, an absolute wall of unrelenting aggression played from the heart and with absolute conviction. For a 45 year old man this is utterly awesome.\n\nSo with Slayer bowing out with a brutal \u2018Raining Blood\u2019 the crowd eagerly awaits the main event \u2013 Metallica.\n\nOk, Metallica shows have been reviewed a million times, and by far more accomplished writers than me, so I am not going to give the typical critique, but I will give some observations.\n\nFirstly the set. Really good mix of old and new. They kick off with the all-time classic \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 which is followed by \u2018For Whom The Bell Tolls\u2019. After these come tracks from every Metallica album except Load and St Anger.\n\nAnd Metallica kick ass. As usual. They put on a great show with great crowd interaction, great visuals, great songs, just... great. But for me there\u2019s one thing which means I cannot listen to this show \u2013 Lars Ulrich.\n\nFrom the very start with \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 Lars lets the side down. Ulrich hasn\u2019t used a ride cymbal for over 20 years. He has a 5-piece drum kit. He simply cannot provide the percussion which a band of Metallica\u2019s standard and stature needs. His drumming makes a mockery of it all. That may sound harsh, but as a drummer I know what is required and he cannot provide it.\n\nHis drumming on \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 is horrible. He can\u2019t play tom rolls \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have the toms. His playing is too fast, too frantic. Metallica sound so lightweight, even on their heavier tracks, that I have to switch off. I will stick to recordings I have from the early- and mid-80s. This is Metallica \u2018lite\u2019, and while I think they do put on a great show, they are in danger of becoming an exhibition band.\n\nListen to Megadeth and Shawn Drover, and Slayer and Dave Lombardo, then listen to Lars Ulrich. Sorry Lars but....\n\nSo, the Big 4 Sofia boxset \u2013 a superb memento of a great event. Megadeth win this one hands down. In fact hands anywhere. They rule this show and they ruled the tour. If you can get your hands on this limited edition version then do, it is well worth it. \n\nIf not then seek out the DVD only version \u2013 you can still annoy your neighbours, just turn your TV the fuck up.\n\n(Originally reviewed for www.braingell.com)\n",
        "\nBack in 2004, Anthrax was celebrating the 20 year anniversary of the release of their debut album \"Fistful of Metal.\" The anniversary celebration included the release of the \"Music of Mass Destruction\" live album, and this album \"The Greater of Two Evils\": a live in the studio re-recording of many of Anthrax's most famous songs from their classic thrash era.\n\nI have read a number of reviews of this album over the years and the general consensus has been the same since this album came out. The John Bush fans like this album and the Joey Belladonna fans slam it and call it pointless. Being a fan of both singers and both eras of Anthrax, I feel this album is almost a best of both worlds...\n\nWith \"The Greater of Two Evils\" (referred to as TGOTE from here on) the songs stay relatively faithful to the original versions. The only differences are that the verse sections of Deathrider are slowed down to half tempo and songs such as \"I Am The Law\" and \"Caught in a Mosh\" are very slightly slowed down (albeit still very thrashy and certainly not overly slow). However, a few songs including \"Panic\" and \"Gung Ho\" manage to bring the intensity to a much higher level than the original versions ever were. Thus, I feel that in terms of speed, heaviness, and other musical/instrumental factors, many song differences tend to even each other out as the album plays it itself through.\n\nSong differences aside, this album was obviously meant to showcase the best of Anthrax's early material with a more updated modern production. The result is highly successful as the songs recorded for this album sound extremely punchy, defined, clear, and thick. In my opinion, this is possibly the best production job of any Anthrax album to date. The guitars are powerful, the bass guitar is mixed well and audible, the drums are not overly powerful but still solid, and the vocals fit nicely among all the instruments. \n\nThis album was also meant to give Anthrax fans of the 90's and 2000's period a chance to hear studio renditions of the older songs with John Bush on vocals. Again, I feel the result is successful as John makes the songs almost sound like they were wrote with his voice in mind. His voice is melodic, but in deeper, more baritone fashion, which lends a more unique and different character each and every song recorded for this album in comparison to their original versions.\n\nIn terms of the other members, I feel they put in a strong performance as well considering that these tracks were recorded in live takes with likely few to no overdubs. Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano tear through each song adequately and even though one can hear a few hiccups, string noises, and other sounds associated with live metal, it all only adds to organic feel of this recording. Though some of Rob's solos do not follow the exact template of Dan Spitz's solos on the original versions of the songs, I feel that Rob's improvisation is very tasteful and executed quite convincingly. Elsewhere, Frank Bello and Charlie Benante do not miss a beat on the bass guitar and drums respectively. Charlie in particular puts in a stunning performance on the drums and proves that he is still one of metal's elite drummers even in the present day.\n\nStill, the majority of old school Anthrax fans do not seem to enjoy this album one bit. I'm not one to push my opinions or say that others opinions are wrong. Instead I will say that as a 14 year old youngster just beginning the journey of learning to play metal guitar when TGOTE was released, I was inspired to play faster, heavier, and more aggressively after just one listen to this album. Yes, I already knew a few of the songs from their previous versions and respected them for what they were, but when I heard these versions, I knew that I needed to practice my playing for a long time to match the performances on this album. Years later, I appreciate the original versions of these songs much more and have come to like and admire them very much. To this day however, when I pop in TGOTE, I still get that feeling I had as a 14 year old hearing this album for the first time. \n\nSo overall, my opinion on this album is that is a classic, even if it is only re-recordings of old songs. TGOTE does not replace the original song versions recorded in the late 80's and early 90's, but I believe the versions here stand on their own and are great in their own right. So for anyone on the fence about checking out this album if you have heard the original versions, keep an open mind about this record. Yes, it sounds different and maybe very different at times, especially vocally. However, if you are a general metal fan with an interest in thrash metal, I think you will like this album. Scott Ian's linear notes in the album indicate that this album was released to give older ears a reminder of the golden age of thrash as well as give newer ears a chance to hear it for the first time. Figuratively for this reviewer, I'd say that this album did just that!\n\nSo, in closing I give this album a 95 rating. The only -5 about it comes from the production end. Yes, I said the production is well done. However, some static and clipping is audible on TGOTE due the loud mastering that has become all too common in modern metal releases. I'm hoping to someday hear a version of this album mastered with a lower volume in order to hear more dynamics and rich sound quality. Otherwise, this album is rock solid in my opinion!\n",
        "\nMuch has been said down the years about the scales that metal, and in particular thrash, rose to but there has been little in the name of collective footage to actually bring to life this fact for all to see. Until now. \"The Big Four: Live From Sofia, Bulgaria\" does exactly what it says on the tin and it does it so well I can hereby classify it as an essential purchase for anyone who a) likes any combination of Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth or Anthrax, b) is curious to see why these bands got so popular and c) like to have quality metal DVDs to stick on at a party. Clocking it at around 6 hours in total the Big Four play more bonafide classics in one performance than is likely to ever be caught on such a release and with a great 45 minute behind-the-scenes documentary capturing the thoughts of the band members on this celebratory occasion last summer it is not lacking in punches to entice the parting of you and your money.\n\nBill-openers for surely the first time in some years, Anthrax plough through the classics their early albums possess in number - \"Caught In A Mosh\", \"I Am The Law\", \"Madhouse\" and \"Antisocial\" among others - with decent, if fairly under-stated, gusto. If you would ask me Testament better deserve to have Anthrax's place in this hallowed club on both past and recent merits, a theory which holds water when looking at the current standards of the bands. Setting a precedence for which Megadeth and Slayer were soon to follow, the vocals of Joey Belladonna lack much of the prowess his 80's wailing held while the quality of Anthrax's 'recent' (8 years and counting now since a studio release) output is upheld by the appearance of just two songs post-1988 included in their 'best of' set (and one, \"Got The Time\" is a cover). To say Anthrax have been treading water for sometime would serve as a major understatement. However as an opening act their stage performance has been honed incalculably over the years to set the mood adequately for the bigger and better acts that were hot on their heels on a balmy summer\u2019s evening in Bulgaria.\n\nAfter years of public and no doubt private squabbles to see Dave Mustaine sharing a stage with his erstwhile Metallica colleagues must register as a very good day in the history of metal. Unfortunately the weather gods decided otherwise as Megadeth's set in Sofia was somewhat tempered the thunderstorm which blew almost from the moment they hit to the stage to leaving it an hour later. As the strongest candidate for best musician across the four bands Mustaine needs no introduction and his honour is held in the timeless quality of those five songs: \"Holy Wars\", \"Hangar 18\", \"Sweating Bullets\", \"Symphony Of Destruction\" and \"Peace Sells\". Utterly superb. With Dave Ellefson now back as a full-time member and rock solid accompaniment from Chris Broderick and Shawn Drover this is as strong a line-up seen in Megadeth for some years and is recognised in the quality reproduction of all 12 songs played. Whether due to sound problems or general decline with age Mustaine's vocals unfortunately feel weak at times across the set while the rain does it's best to dampen the spirited throngs before them but more is required to hold back a band like Megadeth, whose recent resurgence cannot have gone unnoticed by many.\n\nEasily the act who stuck closest to their guns through the 90's wilderness years Slayer remain, and forever will do, a religion to many of their devoted fans; a religion however that is beginning to look as flaky as some of those absconded in these legends lyrical past. With Tom Araya's vocals lacking all the menace of their classic period and a back injury preventing headbanging or any serious movement from him, Jeff Hanneman apparently adhering to the American cheeseburger diet and his and Kerry King's soloing sounding amateur when in competition with Mustaine, Broderick and Hammett, Slayer have, to these jaded ears, lost so much of what defined their untouchable brilliance of the 80s as to be heavily reliant on the continued brilliance of Dave Lombardo behind the kit. No doubt first-time listeners will continue to be blown away by the destructive power of \"Angel Of Death\", \"Reign In Blood\" et al as I was 10 years ago but having seen it all live many a time from a leaner, fitter Slayer it's hard to subscribe to the devotion many others seem intent on showing. Without having had to stand all day however to catch the multiple classics that a Slayer show is rammed full of their current status is better served as home viewing for this particular set of veterans show why they were only the second biggest band to emerge from the thrash scene\u2026\n\nHowever there can only be one winner in this contest and whom that is can leave no doubt. Metallica are, with good reason if \"The Big Four\" is anything to go by, one of the biggest live draws in all of music today and such a set as played here explains why - even before considering the 'Big Four Jam' cover of Diamond Head's classic \"Am I Evil?\". Spreading their setlist right across their classic first five albums with a small handful from 2008's return to form \"Death Magnetic\" highlights emerge from all songs, notably in my personal favourite \"One\" with its accompanying firework and pryo explosions setting the tone for that grimmest of lyrical subjects. Utilising every inch of the stage to it's full potential messrs. Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett and Trujillo give their typical studious best through classic after classic until the Big Four big event happens: a multi-band jam of \"Am I Evil?\" that resonates through the ages \u2013 cult NWoBHM classic transported to a modern-day stadium anthem, with passion throughout. Needless to say the crowd reaction is enthralling and if any further confirmation was needed, a glorious celebration of the power, and history, of these four bands and with it, heavy metal. A celebratory peak of a great genre as it now reaches into its fourth decade of existence: a true story of gritty perseverance getting it\u2019s just deserves.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nThis album came out at the height of the thrash metal movement in the 1980's, alongside bands like Testament, Overkill and others, but Anthrax were surely different from the likes, injecting more of a punk sound, don't get me wrong, all metal is punk influenced, but Anthrax really showed it more.\n\nThis masterpiece opens with the title track 'Among the Living' beginning with a creepy acoustic lead which works it's way into a heavy as fuck sludgy riff, not headbanging is NOT an option, and then, man this thing speeds up, you might as well set your neck on auto-pilot here, because the riffs, the drumming, the vocals just make you thrash around, cool lyrics, and an awesome solo too 'Caught in a Mosh' is next, and opens with a catchy mid-paced riff, then a nice little bass solo leading into a main riff that just beckons thrash, this song is really catchy, featuring a great pre-chorus 'can't stand it for another day, I ain't gonna live my life this way, cold sweat, my fists are clenching, stomp stomp stomp the idiot convention!' Yes, Anthrax tells it like it is, and don't give a fuck.\n\n'I Am The Law' follows, and slows the album down to a bludgeoning pace, this song is so slow and heavy that it could break glass, with a main riff that is really fun, and the lyrics are fun as well, all you have to do is listen to them, that is another fact about this album, Joey Belladonna's vocals are precise, understandable, but not weak, a little less powerful than it's predecessor 'Spreading the Disease' but the band matured in the couple years in between, Anthrax? mature? well you know what I mean.\n\nI'm going to skip down to 'Indians' which is one of Anthrax's most popular along with Caught in a Mosh, and with good reason, this song is AWESOME, opening with a nifty Iron Maiden-esque riff, moving into a total thrasher, awesome verse, awesome pre-chorus, awesome chorus, yeah, it all works, and then you get to the break, oh man, the break, which slows it down to a stomping halt with Belladonna saying \"WARDANCE\", man this sure is mosh worthy to the fullest, so fucking heavy and intense, this song features more great vocals by Belladonna too, sometimes sounding a bit like Bruce Dickinson, no problem here, throw in an excellent solo, and you have one of the best thrash songs ever.\n\n'One World' follows, this song is really catchy, and it will grow on you, it may not sound good at first listen, but keep on listening, because it's a full speed thrasher that will be stuck in your head after a while, trust me, I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me, the same is true for the next track which is 'A.D.I./Horror of it All' which begins with a beautiful acoustic intro, and then the guitar fades it's way into a stomping sludgy riff and then goes into a nice mid-paced song with catchy vocal lines and catchy riffs all throughout, I believe this to be a very underrated song in the Anthrax catalog.\n\nThe album closes with 'Imitation of Life' which is another mid-paced number pretty much, but closes the album off in a strong way, it does speed up at times as well, but this is certainly the way to close off a great album, not much else to say about it though.\n\nThis is the album that got me into Anthrax, I was weary because of the rap-metal thing, but this was before all that, and I'm glad I didn't hold the rap-metal thing against them, because all their stuff before that is pure unadulterated thrash metal, so in the end, if you're a thrasher, you NEED this album or should already have it, so take your head out from your ass (that was from another song from a different album) and get this album!\n",
        "\nI'm never sure why this album is constantly labeled as Anthrax's worst album. In my opinion, it is John Bush's best album with Anthrax, next to Sound of White Noise. True, this album, and John Bush, did take a while to grow on me. I thought Among the Living was Anthrax's last excellent album. State of Euphoria was dull, Persistence of Time was tl;dl (too long; don't listen), Sound of White Noise was okay, and Stomp 442 was just shit.\n\nAfter a while of only cycling through three Anthrax albums, curiosity got the best of me and I decided to listen to the other ones. Except, once again, Stomp 442. And for a while, I thought Sound of White Noise was John Bush's only great album with Anthrax. I had no intention of ever listening to Stomp 442 in its entirety. \n\nUntil one day, \"Riding Shotgun\" came on while I was asleep. I woke up right when it started and listened thoroughly. I was impressed by Scott Ian and Dimebag Darrell's guitar playing, and was even more impressed at Frank Bello and Charlie Benante. And then came John Bush, who I was still warming up to. And this album broke, or should I say, fucking destroyed the ice. \n\nWhile not as \"friendly\" as Sound of White Noise, Stomp 442 is just as heavy, if not heavier. Stomp 442 is much more experimental than \"Sound O' \" and seems to be a logical step forward for Anthrax, with Dan Spitz having left the band after Sound O'.\n\nTo wrap up, I thought this album is Anthrax's most underrated album to date. It proves Anthrax can do just fine without their traditional sound, Joey, and Dan Spitz. It starts off strong with the five tracks, but really falls short after \"In a Zone\". Recommended tracks include \"Random Acts of Senseless Violence\", \"Fueled\", \"King Size\", and \"Riding Shotgun\". Although I wouldn't hang it as high as I would Sound O', it's definitely a fun one to listen to and a nice album to own.\n",
        "\nOne of the more visible and unfortunate shifts in mainstream music belongs squarely on the shoulders of the grunge movement. Grunge within itself is a wide assortment of musical styles ranging from the dark, Black Sabbath worship of bands Alice In Chains and Soundgarden to the muddy hard rock tendencies of Stone Temple Pilots. Although some of these bands were good, even exceptional in some cases, their rise to the limelight opened the floodgates for many respected 80's outfits to follow suit.\n\nIn the 1990's, just about all of America's more famous thrash acts began collapsing underneath their own weight of trying to keep up with modern times. Metallica is probably the most famous example of this, but even while that band was hell bent on destroying their credibility as a reliable metal outfit, Anthrax topped even them in this contest. Much of the crap this band released between the mid 90's to the end of the decade flirted dangerously with all out mallcore territory and bottom rung groove metal.\n\nHowever, Anthrax's first conformity to mainstream trends wasn't quite as abominable, but I can't say it was delightfully good. \"Sound of White Noise\" was an album I picked up early on in my music purchasing days, and at the time I got immense enjoyment out of it. Needless to say, with age comes maturity and realization that conforming to trends in the name of survival as an artist is hardly a respectable reason for recording and promoting anything below what your band is capable of.\n\nWhat we hear on \"Sound of White Noise\" is the sound of Anthrax abdicating their throne of 80's satrical thrash metal for darker pastures. The first recognizable new element to this group is John Bush, former Armored Saint frontman. Bush isn't a terrible vocalist for this style of music, coming out remarkably better than grunge's false icons like Eddie Vedder. Bush reminds me more of Scott Weiland off STP's earlier days, minus the horribly incoherent lyrics and with a more melodic tinge to his voice. Truth be told, I don't mind John Bush all that much on this release, but he's far from what he is capable of, as his pre-Anthrax contributions to music have proven.\n\nAmongst this initiation into grunge discipleship, we have a one song that pass for decent. \"Only\" is probably the most notable song here, and honestly the only 90's Anthrax song I consider a keeper. It fuses what positive things Anthrax's new sound has going for it and creates a decent song. Beyond that, we have a collection of songs that try desperately to bring in some of the magic that Alice In Chains had going for them. This tends to fall flat, since Anthrax ends up emulating a variety of bands from the era particularly a muddier, heavier version of what was heard on \"Core.\" If this weren't bad enough, Anthrax seems to have donned a Metallica attitude towards songwriting, in that they write songs that are far too long with ideas that are far too few to make those songs interesting. What you then end up with is a collection of grunge rock tributes with a halfway decent vocal job, but obviously nothing any 80's Anthrax fan should ever be caught with.\n\nFor what it is, a grunge rock record, \"Sound of White Noise\" comes out considerably well. Compared to previous material and heavy metal in general, this album succeeds on a few levels but misses out entirely on the more important ones. Ultimately, this album was the beginning of the slippery slope for Anthrax who, like Metallica, ended up ruining most of their credibility by the time the 90's ended. I can't really recommend this album to anyone except maybe grunge enthuaists, but for everyone else avoid it entirely or seek it out second hand.\n",
        "\nWhile Fistful of Metal and Spreading the Disease were both great in their own right, it wasn't until their third album Among the Living that New York's Anthrax embraced the crunchy thrash of their prime. Packed full of memorable lyrics and more riffs than you can shake Scott Ian's goatee-thing at, it was easily one of the better thrash albums of 1987.\n\n\"Among the Living\" begins with a creepy whimper, a simple acoustic line doused in reverb, while feedback resonates. The bang comes in the form of a slowly chugging thrash gallop notable for the bouncing bass, like a pair of breasts wobbling out of a tube top. I've always considered Anthrax a unique band because of their ability to match a fairly weak vocal style with some powerful riffing. This isn't to say I think Joey Belladonna has a bad voice by any means; but it's always struck me as very thin by comparison to the powerful weight of the guitars. This is balanced with backups and gang shouts. \"Caught in a Mosh\" is a catchier song than it has any right to be with such a stupid title, with a nice groove to the chorus guitars and some pretty irresistable gang shouts. \"I Am the Law\" improves the album considerably, a choppy thrasher based on the Judge Dredd comic (yes, that's fucking awesome).\n\n\"Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)\" is a perky thrasher that opens with a nice melodic hook, obviously about some beef the band members had with some suckas. Get it, you say the song title backwards...\"Nice Fuckin' Life\". So clever...and it would inspire the band to create other classic titles like Penikufesin. Despite itself, the song is still pretty good. \"Skeletons in the Closet\" is another of the better tracks on the album, with a catchy Belladonna vocal hook in the chorus and a slew of anthemic thrashing rhythms and bass flair. It's based on the Apt Pupil short story by Steven King which was later made into a decent film. I never quite got into \"Indians\" when I was younger, but the track has aged decently and accumulated on me, especially I like the build-up to the charge riff in the middle of the verse.\n\nThe album closes out with three of its strongest. \"One World\" opens with an almost gladiatoral feel, erupting into a hammering thrash rhythm which would sound fresh if it came out yesterday. The vocals sound great on this track, their level in the mix is just low enough that Joey can go a little crazy and create this desperate, powerful thrust over the guitars. \"A.D.I./The Horror of It All\" begins with some nice acoustics and a lengthy heavy intro. Once again the riffs in this song are great and Belladonna has some memorable vocal lines here, making 'whoah eh ohs' officially cool in thrash metal. \"Imitation of Life\" is perhaps the most mature track on the album, with an unforgettable volley of precision riffing and one of the meanest New York grooves this side of old Biohazard. And what disaffected youth could resist the lyrics?\n\n'There's nothing I hate more, than all these plastic people\nWith all their plastic promises, and all there plastic deals\nThey just can't be themselves, and live their own lives out\nThey're just an imitation of what life's all about'\n\nAmong the Living brings back a lot of nostalgia, years of skateboarding and chumming around with a half dozen guys who would wear their various 'Not Man' t-shirts for half of every week. Though I truly adored this album when it was released, I do not feel it has aged quite as well as Persistence of Time, which I consider the strongest of the Anthrax catalog. Crank the volume and this remains just as head banging as ever, but the drumming is rather dull by today's standards and a few of the songs' lyrics are quite goofy. At any rate, this is still a great album to rock out to with some dark, memorable riffing.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThere were but a few concert videos around in the eighties from thrash metal bands. Most actually had hardly two or three music videos even. But then there were those Combat vids, 3-Way-Thrash, US Speed Metal Attack, Metal Hammer Roadshow, etcetera, containing a few songs from each band live and that was the stuff! Therefore having this Anthrax concert was a bliss. Good setlist, damn good sound and of course, a great visual performance.\n\nNow, this is not for the weak hearted. This video may even cause damage to heavy metal fundamentalists! Parental advisory. Apart from brilliant music, this video contains bermudas, humour, an a cappella version of the classic Blues Brothers tune and even rap. Those not interested or highly sensitive, leave immediately! Ohw, and stop trying to bash Anthrax\u2019 obvious musical and compositional qualities during the Joey-era because of their looks, antics, jokes and rap EP\u2019s or even calling it the rear end of thrash simply because they were not The Evil Boys nor sounded like Kreator and Slayer but, aside from their marvellous regular studio albums, made fun of dogmas which have only grown stronger throughout the years. If you cannot handle the fact that this band made a few rap songs, you mustn\u2019t look at this video because they\u2019re performing one live, acting strangely pubescent, dressing up even more and are deliberately making a mess of it.\n\nI will keep this review as short as possible. All those people who like Anthrax in their speed and thrash metal prime would like this video. It\u2019s the best from Spreading The Disease and Among The Living with a few extras thrown in. And since most sane people value those Anthrax album the highest, you do the math. Of course, one would like to see songs like Imitation Of Life, Panic, Aftershock and One World as well, but that\u2019s a minor complaint. There is not a single bad song to be found here for the Anthrax fans of old.\n\nAt this point in time Anthrax were trendsetting. And to be trendsetting implies disregarding dogma, interpret worn out paths your own way, just do something which feels right and see where it leads you. In Anthrax\u2019 case: world fame.\nI will leave you all with a quote. If you get it, this video is for you. If not, you\u2019ll probably never get it.\n'We need to get it together if we're going to wow them at the Festival'\n'What, you mean ... like ... learn to play?'\n'No! Music With Rocks In just happens. If you go around learning you'll never get anywhere.'\n",
        "\nFor those of you wondering what the title of my reviews means. Just dive into the history of The Sex Pistols. Yes, a band that had been covered by Anthrax on two occasions earlier. Well, feeling cheated is exactly what happens after spending money on \u2018Live (The Island Years)\u2019.\n\nJust like with Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth etcetera etcetera, the Anthrax fans would never see a regular full length live album during the eighties. Thrash bands just didn\u2019t do that yet. Vinyl bootlegs were all around of course but you never knew what they\u2019d sound like and from time to time you just tried one or two, just to have some live stuff and more than half the time you'd be utterly disappointed by the quality of such things. But releasing this officially, two years after Belladonna had left Anthrax, was flogging a dead horse. Cheap cashing in even, since the sound quality of this release is hardly acceptable.\n\nWe have 8 songs from a regular concert but with a muddy wall of sound, bereft of all dynamics. The sound is flooded by the guitars which often lack sharpness. It sounds like not much effort has been made to clean up these recordings to make them an acceptable official release and worthy of spending your hard earned money. No, if you wanted the full enjoyment of Anthrax in their prime live with Joey, your best bet around the time of this release would still be getting your hands on the 1987 Oidivnikufesin video.\n\nNow 8 songs with a highly debatable sound is one thing, but filling up the album with alleged live songs with a studio audience wrecks the last credibility. Yes, the songs are performed live and one can hear some audience. However this time the production is thin, flat, lacks energy and aggression. So this time it\u2019s too tame and not really \u2018live\u2019 as we would like it, again a setback.\n\nI\u2019ve seen Anthrax live in those days and this album doesn\u2019t do them any justice whereas a lot of live records from other artists were polished up, even had some parts re-recorded, giving the impression a band was even better than it actually was. Nah, the label just had some stuff laying around. Didn\u2019t bother to clean it up or at least boost it up a little and just threw it in the faces of those remembering the days of Anthrax with Joey or even those who had missed them and could finally get a change to hear them perform live. \n\nHistory was blemished. This hasn\u2019t been set straight until 2007, when finally \u2018Caught in a Mosh: BBC Live in Concert\u2019 was released with two recordings from 1987. Although they had been around on bootlegs already for many years of course. Don\u2019t waste your cash on this release but look for those others I mentioned in my review. Apart from that, yes it\u2019s rare to hear a live version of \u2018Now It's Dark\u2019 so for the real collectors there\u2019s always a reason to buy just about everything. A large part of the setlists here is such a reason. So at least some points for that.\n",
        "\nAnthrax had released EP\u2019s earlier also featuring obscure stuff and covers, and those were either good or great, this time however they released a full length full of it and it was just too much as well as lacking cohesion this time. Why on earth a full length release? Possibly because of the upcoming tour with Public Enemy and their label wanting something new on the market.\n\nNow, the remakes of the S.O.D. songs are utterly useless. I still don\u2019t know why they felt the need to bring songs from a side-project back to \u2018Thrax and in fact weakening the legacy. Same could be said about \u2018I'm the Man '91\u2019 which is just a horrible unlistenable remix. Also the presence of two live songs, \u2018Keep It in the Family\u2019 and \u2018Belly of the Beast\u2019, seems rather redundant on a full length album even though the performance and sound are pretty good. And more so because everything is scattered on the album.\n\n\u2018N.F.B. (Dallabnikufesin)\u2019 feels like an answer to M.O.D.\u2019s Ode To Harry. A joke can\u2019t always be funny, especially when you think Scott Ian actually wrote a lot of stuff for the USA For MOD album. Secondly GangGreen had released the ultimate metal ballad parody on their \u201989 album \u2019Older Budweiser\u2019 and this ballad doesn\u2019t even come close to either the MOD nor GangGreen efforts.\n\nWhat makes this album actually worth purchasing are two songs in particular. \u2018Bring the Noise\u2019 and \u2018Startin' Up a Posse\u2019. Bring The Noise is a remake of an old Public Enemy song and as it is performed by both bands, it sounds convincing in both the metal as well as rap department. And yes, it is catchy as hell! \u2018Startin' Up a Posse\u2019 is a joke, but unlike the ballad it\u2019s a joke which is also funny the second time around. A great foul mouthed happy tune against censorship with Scott Ian taking the mike. Well, actually there\u2019s a third song for those who hadn\u2019t gotten their hands on it already: \u2018Protest & Survive\u2019 is just great, good heavy sound and Scott does a great job on vocals. It sounds raw and aggressive, exactly what a Discharge song needs. Great effort.\n\nAm I not forgetting anything? Well, yes I am . An Anthrax collector in \u201992 would\u2019ve gotten his/her hands on the 1989 Penikufesin EP already. So either don\u2019t use those songs here or include the whole damn thing, including Friggin\u2019 In The Riggin\u2019 and not just 3 songs. Why on earth did they do this?\n\nWell, at least I give the band some credit for trying to create some stuff especially for this release but it still suffers immensely from having \u201870% filler\u2019 written all over it. And the mistake of not including the entire Penikufesin EP is pretty unforgivable. So, 3 out of 12 songs making this release really worthwhile and then of course two good live versions of great songs. Just get your hands on the Penikufesin, I\u2019m The Man and Armed&Dangerous EP\u2019s first!\n",
        "\nSecond half of the nineties, a lot of thrash metal acts were releasing EP\u2019s around this time. Most filled with obscure versions of songs, covers, live versions, all that kind of stuff. Penikufesin is one of the best EP\u2019s from that era, coming from a thrash metal act.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the worst then. The only failed experiment here. The alleged French version of \u2018Antisocial\u2019. I do know the original, which has it\u2019s own specific charm with even an early eighties \u2018industrial\u2019 punk touch and of course, sung in French with a punk sneer. \nAnthrax\u2019 \u2018State Of Euphoria\u2019 version emphasised on everything \u2018metal\u2019 about the song, trimming it, tightening it. A lot of obvious differences between both versions and both worked perfectly the way they were. However, on this Penikufesin-version (only the vocals were re-done, the instrumental State Of Euphoria version was used) Trust vocalist Bernie Bonvoisin sings along, in French, and Joey Belladonna has trouble pronouncing and more important, keeping up. The idea was nice but the performance really lacking and sloppy.\n\nFriggin\u2019 In The Riggin\u2019 is nicely done. Anthrax managed to make the song sound more metal, only due to the production and heavy guitars obviously but without losing the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the original. They did this by singing all together. And yes, the song is funny. And Anthrax were good at being funny.\n\n\u2018Parasite\u2019 is amazing. Obviously the production here is much better and more clear than the original 1974 Kiss version but the performance here is energetic and especially Joey Belladonna does a marvellous job on vocals. This song really suits him. Speaking of performance, the swing and ease with which the band works its way through \u2018Sects\u2019 is undeniably superb. Once again Anthrax prove to have top musicians in their midst. They also manage to create surf-metal by covering the Ventures song \u2018Pipeline\u2019. Funny that M.O.D. had a go at surf as well only a few months earlier. And once again, Anthrax made it work.\n\nThe brilliance here is that Anthrax shovels up a mixed bag of bands and influences and make it work. Making it sound logical and cohesive. The production, performance and especially the understanding and feeling of the original music which they needed to create their own interpretation, all fall into place here. Possibly unconsciously but successful nevertheless.\n",
        "\nYes, two reasons. And the first half of this EP isn\u2019t one of them. Since the title track comes straight from Spreading The Disease and \u2018Raise Hell\u2019 can be considered an obvious generic leftover, this EP has trouble warming up.\n\nNo, one of the main reasons for getting this EP if you already own Fistful Of Metal and Spreading The Disease, are the (live?) versions of \u2018Metal Thrashing Mad\u2019 and \u2018Panic\u2019 with Joey Belladonna on vocals. Not only is the sound slightly more aggressive than on the Fistful of Metal album but with Joeys vocals these songs finally really come to life. Especially \u2018Panic\u2019 turns out to be a fantastic proto-thrashing speed metal tune which takes Judas Priest\u2019s Exciter into Metal Militia territory. Simple in your face riffs, fabulous harmonies and leads and, as said, marvellous vocals.\n\nSecondly the addition of the \u2018Soldiers Of Metal\u2019 single is pretty sweet and even though the production already very sounded dated in \u201985, especially the version of \u2018Howling Furies\u2019 is convincing performance-wise. Although I would have preferred the band to have re-recorded the entire Fistful Of Metal album with Joey on vocals and with the Spreading The Disease production obviously. Instead, some of the guys recorded the S.O.D. album, so who am I to complain.\n\nLeaves us with the Sex Pistols cover \u2018God Save The Queen\u2019 which sounds rather flat and Joey doesn\u2019t give it his best or just doesn\u2019t \u2018feel\u2019 this song. No, with Joey on vocals, classic metal and rock songs are a wiser choice, as the band would prove later with Black Sabbath en Kiss material. When playing punk, just let Scott do the vocals or everyone in the band, like Friggin\u2019 In The Riggin\u2019. Anyone remember their version of Protest & Survive? That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nQualitatively speaking, only point deduction for Raise Hell and God Save The Queen. Apart from that, just a great collection of stuff.\n",
        "\nRebirth? Rebirth of what exactly? Compared to their previous two studio efforts, \u2018We've Come for You All\u2019 was indeed a rebirth of inspiration for Anthrax. It was, however, not the promised rebirth of their eighties sound. But did they actually promise that? I can hardly remember. It probably was their label and such who did that. \u2018We've Come for You All\u2019 just simply perfects and crystallises the path already set in by their earlier Volume8 album on which the band had regained their humour, dynamics and, most of all, willingness to just try some stuff.\n\nThe metal side of the album delivers most of the time in terms of quality groove metal material. The strong opener \u2018What Doesn\u2019t Die\u2019 is heavy. Not as good as the openers on Sound Of White Noise nor Volume8, but very good indeed. Good drive, catchy enough chorus. \u2018Superhero\u2019 has that violent-video-game kind of catchy riffing with a stompin\u2019 midpaced drive and the main riff from 'Any Place But Here' could have come straight from Metallica\u2019s black album or even Load, thus being very catchy and nineties-proof. Nice waltzing on 'Refuse To Be Denied' by the way. It\u2019s post-thrash or groove metal or whatever you want to call it, but these are some good songs simply because the band does deliver in the riff and performance departments. Best metal song here, performance wise, is 'Nobody Knows Anything', a showcase for Charlie Benante to just funk it out!\n\nJust like 'Black Lodge' and 'Harms Way' on earlier Bush-era releases this album delivers another (semi) ballad, 'Safe Home'. Not as good as Black Lodge but much better than Harms Way and especially the guitars during the middle section are sheer beauty!\n\nThe rest of the album however truly fails to deliver. Even though 'Black Dahlia' is possibly the most aggressive song on the album, that black metal riff and blast speed drums make the song sound like a parody. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant that way but it just feels like a collection of leftovers from SOD\u2019s Bigger Than The Devil sessions. A failure, just like that other joke, 'Cadillac Rock Box', a very generic rock tune which goes in one ear and out the other. Other songs like 'Taking the Music Back', 'Thinking about an End' and the title track only have a few good ideas hidden within the composition but just don\u2019t impress nor even convince as a whole. Worthless fillers.\n\nYes, indeed this was once again a small step forward for Anthrax. But because of the large amount of fillers, they still did not come close to their best effort with Bush, The Sound Of White Noise. However it does come in second place from the 1992-2003 era. But to those, craving something even remotely similar to the Belladonna days, stay clear.\n",
        "\nI hardly ever see the use of re-recording old material which was already perfect as it was. In the case of Anthrax the only exception I ever made were the songs \u2018Metal Thrashing Mad\u2019 and \u2018Panic\u2019 on the 1985 \u2018Armed&Dangerous\u2019 EP where Joey Belladonna and the boys totally shattered the short existence of Neil Turbin. Which in turn made me realise how mediocre Anthrax\u2019 first album actually was mostly because of Turbin. I wished they\u2019d re-recorded the whole damn Fistful album with Belladonna back then really. And of course with the Spreading or even the Among production. Anyway\u2026\n\nWhen Anthrax went into the nineties and changed their style to fit the era, they also got a vocalist to go with the new sound. John Bush is perfect for the material on Sound Of White Noise and such but his \u2018grungy\u2019 rock radio sound never really suited the old songs live. It was adequate. His did his best, but he just isn\u2019t a classic (epic) metal vocalist. He\u2019s the quintessential modern rock vocalist. Joey was metal, John simply rocked. This says nothing about quality or integrity but just the specific sound and techniques.\n\nThe second aspect which often damages re-recording of eighties material in the 21st century is the production. It\u2019s mostly digital these days and everything\u2019s become so transparent and lifeless, most modern metal records have lost rawness, character and sparkle at the same time. Walls of guitars and in-your-face drums blur each possibility of dynamics. However, on \u2018The Greater of Two Evils\u2019 the whole damn sound is flat. Monotone and dull. Hell, even the guitars aren\u2019t loud enough! Because of its flatness, the production, or whatever you want to call it, is worse than your average modern day demo (which are often home recordings even)\n\nBush\u2019s voice and the flat sound just don\u2019t do justice to energetic stuff like \u2018Gung Ho\u2019 and \u2018Caught In A Mosh\u2019 let alone relive or revive that youthful enthusiastic and eager feeling the original versions did have. It\u2019s just dull. Sounds like a bunch of lame covers from an obscure band. You know, one of those millions of \u2018tribute\u2019 albums out there these days, filled with unknown crap acts you don\u2019t give a shit about from Poland, Italy and Sweden or whatever country. The fact that Spitz\u2019 leads often aren\u2019t played right makes things even worse. And when you change a historical landmark, ouch, who needs that?\n\nI don\u2019t see it. I just don\u2019t. What is the use of this release other than for the band themselves? To get an idea themselves what old Anthrax sounds like in 2004. This album gives me exactly the same feeling as those \u2018official bootlegs\u2019 by Dream Theater, covering the entire Master Of Puppets and Number Of The Beast albums, or the infamous \u2018Let There Be Blood\u2019. I just don\u2019t see it.\n\nNow, I can go on and give this album just an average rating. 50 or 60 points or whatever since the album didn\u2019t hurt anyone and leaves me almost emotionless. But the utter uselessness of it forces me to discard it.\n",
        "\nTwo years after the successful crossover album with their side project S.O.D., Ian & Benante released another outing for their own fun without even thinking about the consequences. This time they mixed metal with rap. Over the years this funny EP has become one of the focal points of Anthrax-bashers or should I say excuse? Well, some just bash \u2018Thrax for the weak regular studio albums they released during the nineties with John Bush on vocals but most trolls focus on this little EP trying to point out that anthrax have always sucked. Even if this EP had really been bad, this would not have had any influences on the majesty of their Spreading & Living albums.\n\nNo, there was nothing commercial about the I\u2019m The Man EP. Only a true idiot could think Anthrax would release a joke like this for world fame. This was pure for the fun. We have a simple beat, one guitar playing Hava Nagila and the rest of the band rapping juvenile rhymes. On top of that a band picture which points out clearly that posing in a sport outfit with long hair makes you look like members of the Andre Agassi fanclub. Yeah, they really made this EP to sell out. Right\u2026\n\nHow do you take your heavy metal? \nBlack as midnight on a moonless night. \nPretty black.\n\nDuring the second half of the eighties and also now in the 21st century there are (thrash) metal fundamentalists. People who are convinced a real thrash metal band should wear leather, spikes and sing about either Satan, Nuclear Holocausts, Violence or just beer and women. Often these are the people who are also complaining when a retro band brings nothing new to the table. These people were often born without humour and especially shat onto this earth just to remain unhappy. It\u2019s exactly for that kind of people an EP like this is the ultimate statement. A big fuck you! to all middleclass \u2018keep-metal-brutal\u2019 preachers out there who take themselves to seriously and persist in projecting their own dogma\u2019s on others.\n\nThis is Anthrax, eager for fun. They wear a smile. Everybody run! Now, to make this EP worth getting, apart from the three version of the title track, are the Black Sabbath cover \u2018Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\u2019 which is surprisingly brilliant, heavy and features a top performance by Joey Belladonna and possibly the best live version ever of \u2018Caught in a Mosh\u2019.\n",
        "\nSecond half of the nineties. The era when thrash was truly dead and even death metal became a bland and generic imitation of itself. The second half of the nineties, when power metal was starting to make a comeback but the scene was dominated by the upcoming gothic metal scene with tarts in dresses, Gothenburg hippies and of course the third wave of black metal. All in all, the most boring era ever within the metal scene.\n\nEither thrash bands were gone during these days or they were releasing mediocre albums with modern influences just to stay alive for a while. Anthrax were no exception. The band had killed themselves and their credibility when they released Stomp442 in 1995. Now fortunately this implied that anything new they\u2019d release afterwards, would be better no matter what. And so it was! Volume 8 is a nice little album. Far from classic, but a nice groovy album nonetheless if you\u2019d be able to forget the name Anthrax being on the cover.\n\nNow I know many people claim Anthrax\u2019 best Bush-era songs would be Room For One More, Potters Field or What Doesn\u2019t Die, but each and everyone keeps forgetting Crush. The opening song on this album probably is their heaviest non-thrash song with John Bush up until now (2009 that is). And apart from that it features a massive main riff, catchy rhythm and excellent chorus. With a song like this I do not care this is not a classic speed or thrash metal album. This is the kind of quality heavy post-thrash song Anthrax used on half the Sound Of White Noise album and maybe even better at that.\n\nAnother big difference with Stomp442 is the fact that Volume 8 sounds more laid back, more at ease. Not just the performance but the production as well. Stomp442 was overly organised and too straight forward. Volume 8 is not. The band tries different stuff like the country song 'Toast to the Extras' which actually is great with John Bush on vocals. The groove-metal songs on the album have gotten more space to breathe and are, as said, played more laid back and less neurotic that before. Best songs, apart from the earlier mentioned masterpiece Crush, are 'Catharsis', 'Inside Out', 'Born Again Idiot' and 'Killing Box'.\n\nThe two SOD-ish joke songs \u2018604\u2019 and \u2018Cupajoe\u2019 are funny but nowhere as good as any real SOD joke and they obviously don\u2019t fit a regular Anthrax album that well. But it\u2019s good to hear the band having fun again and doing whatever they want, shaking off the chains which earlier forced them to make Stomp442. And that attitude and atmosphere is exactly what makes this album decent.\n\nEven though this album will never be in anyone\u2019s list of favourite/best Anthrax albums, it\u2019s good to hear the band we\u2019re slowly getting human again after the forced and neurotic 1995 debacle. Volume 8 is a laid back album from the hibernation-era, revealing a band at least having fun with each other again. And that was more than enough for me.\n",
        "\nIt's not too surprising that my feelings about \"We've Come For You All\" after the first few listens were mainly of disappointment. During the period that this album was released, as well in smaller amounts in the years after, this was labeled as a true return to form; a return to the thrash days of yore. Of course these days it seems like every time a band from the 80s releases an album, people are jumping all over it as a \"return to form,\" which in reality is true only 30% of the time, if that. At that time, however, I was more naive to those sorts of claims.\n\nAfter a year or two of being banished underneath my bed to collect dust, I pulled out the album again and listened to it one last time to determine whether I should get a small return by selling the album to a local music store. When I listened this time, I was able to appreciate \"We've Come For You All\" a bit more. This is because my expectations for this album were different. I knew that I was getting an album that was quite different from their releases from the 80s.\n\nFor the record, there is no thrash to be found here. A couple of songs could be classified as metal, but most of the material is hard rock with a metal influence. The songs are mostly mid-paced with simple riffs and most of the songs focusing on the vocals, especially on creating a platform for a catchy chorus. This will obviously turn many Anthrax and metal fans off because one of the things that made Anthrax so great in their heyday was Scott Ian's furious thrash riffs. \n\nThe main reason that this album is worth listening to is because of John Bush. He gives his best performance with Anthrax and you can tell he's giving 110%. His choruses are memorable and he sings the faster songs really well too. He takes otherwise mediocre songs such as \"Refuse To Be Denied\" and \"Superhero.\" He does his best to salvage \"Safe Home,\" but that song was pretty much DOA from the beginning. \"Any Place But Here\" would have been a much better choice for a single because of its catchy theme and excellent chorus. \n\nThe best song on this recording is probably \"What Doesn't Die.\" It's certainly a fast song (not thrash) and Bush again gives a great performance. Lead guitarist Rob Caggiano plays one of his only solos on the record which also happens to be one of the only decent solos on the album. Scott Ian and Charlie Benante play the rest of the solos and while Benante is STILL a better lead guitarist than Ian even after all these years (he had the better solos on \"Speak English or Die\" also), but neither are able to do anything especially interesting as far as leads go. Charlie Benante has always been an amazing drummer and he has done a fine job filling many of the songs with insane hyper-speed drumming; it's a shame that he couldn't write better music to go with it. \n\nOverall this is certainly no return to form, but it's far better than anything Anthrax has done since \"The Sound of White Noise.\" Once one gets past the fact that this isn't a thrash album, (I had high hopes for \"W.C.F.Y.A.\" but it's just a lousy mid-paced song), then one can appreciate it for the decent hard rock album that it is. Obviously this is far from essential, but John Bush's vocal performance makes this album worth owning, especially for those who are fans of his singing. I've seen several copies of this in local bargain bins, so at that price this is definitely worth it.\n",
        "\nThe Greater of Two Evils is a compilation album of re-recorded songs from Anthrax\u2019s first five albums from their thrash metal period. While the re-recorded versions are solid only a few actually live up to the originals. The track listing is well set up containing most of Anthrax\u2019s classic songs and a few surprises. One main difference is that these versions are sung by John Bush instead of Neil Turbin and Joey Belladonna on the originals.\n\nMost of the songs themselves are very close to the originals considering that they were recorded in a live studio. Most of the songs are longer than their original forms like I Am the Law, Belly of the Beast, Among the Living, and Indians. The Greater of Two Evils is just as thrash based as the original versions considering that this line up has never released a thrash metal album. The production is top notch really giving a cleaner heavier punch to most of the tracks. Surprisingly John Bush\u2019s mid- range grungy vocals work really well with the three cuts from Fistful of Metal, I can even say that these three songs are better than the originals.\n\nThe bands performance sounds much more solid than they have for years you can hear that they are really enjoying recording these classics again. John Bush\u2019s voice fits well with the Turbin era songs but not nearly as well as on the Joey era since he can\u2019t do the very melodic high pitch range at all. Dan Spitz and Scott Ian play most of the songs even faster than on the original\u2019s which is quite a feat considering the originals were pretty fast. Frank Bello\u2019s bass unlike the originals is unfortunately inaudible though I pin that blame on the album\u2019s production. Charlie Benante\u2019s drumming is awesome he doesn\u2019t sound nearly this good on the originals (just listen to Panic its drum intro is much better here).\n\nUnfortunately the songs are usually longer than the originals, making many of them lag especially since they are performed at higher speeds on this compilation. Some great songs are not present like Anthrax\u2019s cover of Got the Time, Blood, Time, Armed and Dangerous, Finale and S.S.C/ Stand or Fall. The production while clean and much higher in volume lacks the killer rawness of the originals. Finally the album length is much too long clocking in at just under 75 minutes, if Anthrax added some more songs they could have made a great 2 disc compilation instead.\n\nThe Greater of Two Evils is overall a solid compilation of re-recorded Anthrax classics. The Best songs are Deathrider, Madhouse, Panic, and Gung-Ho (which also features Lone Justice on the second half of the song). I recommend this album to Anthrax fans and thrash metal enthusiasts only.\n\n-5 points John Bush fails on vocals for the Joey Belladonna period\n-5 points many of the songs lag because of length\n-5 points some great Anthrax songs are not present\n-5 points album is too long\n-2 points production lacks the rawness of the originals\n",
        "\nState of Euphoria was a major disappointment the first time I listened to it and it doesn\u2019t get better with time. Anthrax started to dabble in progressive thrash on this release and unlike on Persistence of Time it does not work well. The band members seem to have been stuck in a rut on State of Euphoria in terms of the songwriting. I would have to say this is Anthrax\u2019s weakest album of the 80\u2019s hands down. \n\nMost of the songs on State of Euphoria are either in the vein of Among the Living or Persistence of Time meaning fast or mid-tempo thrashers. Leading the way for Persistence of Time this album starts to introduce longer songs more complex riffing and more melodic solos. Unfortunately the quality and entertainment value is much lower than on those above mentioned albums. Not unusual for Anthrax a cover is present Antisocial originally done by Trust, fortunately I have heard the original and can say this version is much better. Two songs on State of Euphoria can be mentioned in the same breath as Anthrax\u2019s classics namely Be All, End All with it infectious melodic intro and equally interesting lead riff and chorus. Also the album highlight/closer aptly titled Finale with its heavy stop start opening riff and equally pummeling main riff. The albums production values are higher and mixes each instrument well so you can hear them individually.\n\nThe band\u2019s performance is not as solid as on other releases but still showcase\u2019s their skills. Joey Belladonna vocals seem to be far less passionate than on any other Anthrax album with him at the helm. He sticks far more to his mid-range and doesn\u2019t use his high pitch falsettos as often. Scott Ian and Dan Spitz are the weakest link on Euphoria displaying their most uninspired riffs, leads, and solos in their career up to this point. Frank Bello\u2019s bass like on Persistence of Time is more audible unfortunately it doesn\u2019t forge its own path as much like on Persistence. Charlie Benante\u2019s drum work is great showcasing his skills as a formidable double kick bass king and a fill master. \n\nState of Euphoria is usually seen as the black spot of Anthrax\u2019s 80\u2019s albums and unfortunately it rightly deserves that title. The album standouts are Be All, End All, Antisocial, Schism, and Finale. I recommend this album only to fans of Anthrax and more mid-tempo thrashers.\n\n-10 points lower quality than on earlier releases\n-10 points uninspired riffs, leads, and solos\n-10 points less passion and cohesiveness than on earlier releases\n-4 points change of musical direction didn\u2019t affectively work\n",
        "\nPersistence of Time Anthrax\u2019s last album with Joey Belladonna always seems to be overlooked when people acknowledge Anthrax\u2019s best releases. Anthrax\u2019s style change was already noticeable on State of Euphoria but it really comes into being on Persistence of Time. Persistence of Time mixes the old Anthrax trademark of a very punk influenced thrash metal style with a more mid tempo Progressive style. It work\u2019s remarkably well since the songs are more complex, longer, and contain some really inspiring riff work.\n\nThe songs themselves can be divided into three categories mid-tempo progressive thrash, epic mid-tempo progressive thrash, and the more strait forward thrashers. Persistence of Time is much longer than other Anthrax albums clocking in at just under and hour and fortunately it works well (anthrax was always good at writing longer songs). The complexity has increased relying much more on alternating lead/riff work than the trademark thrashy speed metal riffs of Anthrax\u2019s older material. Persistence of Time is also far more melodic than on any Anthrax release before or after. Persistence of Time\u2019s production is great mixing ever instrument just write.\n\nThe band\u2019s performance is top notch on Persistence of Time especially Joey Belladonna\u2019s. Joey as usual pulls of his high pitch classic metal styled vocals but this time around he uses more mid-range and thrash shouts than on any Anthrax release before. Dan Spitz and Scott Ian trade off some of their best lead and riff work throughout Persistence of Time. Charlie Benante pulls off his tightest performance of his career filling Persistence with great double kick bass, fills, and hand drumming. Finally Frank Bello\u2019s bass guitar is more audible than on any other Anthrax release and provides some interesting bass solos on some of the songs.\n\nUnfortunately the quality doesn\u2019t hold for the entire duration of Persistence of Time mainly the last three songs which overstay their welcome. Joey Belladonna does utilize some rap type gang vocals on Time and Blood fortunately they are used rarely. Too many songs also clutter Persistence of Time Anthrax should have shaved the album down a couple of songs for momentums sake. Finally the solos are far more melodic and they do fit each song but they just don\u2019t entertain like they used to. \n\nOverall I would rate Persistence of Time on an equal footing as Among the Living. If Anthrax worked on Persistence of Time a bit more it could have easily been their magnum opus. Best songs are Time, Blood, Belly Of The Beast, and Got the Time (anthrax\u2019s best cover song). I highly recommend this album to any fans of Anthrax and Progressive thrash.\n\n-4 points album quality doesn\u2019t hold for the entire album\n-4 points rap elements in the vocals are present on Time and Blood\n-4 points solos are less entertaining than on previous Anthrax offerings\n-4 points a few too many songs are present on this album\n",
        "\nAnthrax the thrash band that experimented into the realms of rap-metal, mainly as a joke, which is quite an amusing one. \n\nWell there\u2019s no doubt that this would be well produced, but the mix is nice and clear everything is heard at decent levels. But the S.O.D. cover is a little troubling, with the down tuning, being quite portent of things to come for these guys. Musicianship is the same for these guys, with Scott & Dan playing some great energy pumped guitar riffs & a decent solo on Milk, and the odd outro on that very song is amusing as well. The rhythm section is good, Charlie does some intriguing fills on Bring the Noise. Frank\u2019s bass fills are well heard and lively to boot, Milk\u2019s pretty much where you\u2019ll hear most of the bass though. But Joey does quite a good job on the S.O.D. cover showing how truly fast he can go. But the Bring the Noise featuring the entire Anthrax crew plus Public Enemy is an entertaining endeavor, fusing thrash\u2019s gang shouts with Flava\u2019s \u201cYaaaaaaBoi\u201ds is somewhat odd. But it\u2019s even more amusing that Scott gets some limelight on the Public Enemy cover as the vocalist for verses three & four.\n\nWell this is an amusing experience, if you don\u2019t take it seriously, but it\u2019s good for a few laughs-75%\n\n[note: this review was for the Promo-disk version with two tracks]\n",
        "\nIn probably one of the most surreal moments in my life, I walked home with my copy of this, the promise of new life being breathed into a band that I\u2019d love for more than 10 years and had hoped would return to its original form. Everything was in its perfect order as I placed this DVD into the drive and began watching a historical moment in thrash metal history, the reformation of the classic Anthrax lineup. As the opening part of \u201cAmong The Living\u201d began ringing out through the speaker system in a pre-recorded fashion as the band took the stage, the New York audience that these 5 musicians were once a part of decades back gave a roar comparable to what occurs at Iron Maiden concerts, and thus began the grand endeavor of reliving the glory of the past and playing songs that they had not played together as a complete band in just under 15 years.\n\nFrom start to finish, this concert is an epic win, even if it wasn\u2019t a permanent occurrence. There\u2019s nothing half assed about what occurs, everybody puts their all into what they\u2019re doing and expresses their love for the audience in a tasteful manner in between songs, rather than going off for 5 minutes on some rant about the past. The highlight moment is when Scott Ian temporarily sheds his commercialist sensibilities and introduces the lone song from the debut album \u201cFistful Of Metal\u201d to appear on this set \u201cDeathrider\u201d with a resounding \u201cthis is fucking thrash metal!\u201d. Although Belladonna has to sing underneath the volley of excessive Halford worship that went on when Neil Turbin coined the original studio version, he holds his own and gets the job done nicely, though the fans seem too busy banging their heads right off of their shoulders to notice.\n\nHighlight performances on here are many, most of them realized by Belladonna, Benante and Spitz, but the collective success of the whole is present throughout. Things really come together on \u201cMedusa\u201d, where Belladonna doesn\u2019t miss a note and screams his soul out to the audience in a purely methodical fashion. \u201cTime\u201d comes out as it\u2019s supposed to, not having it\u2019s tempo rushed by the human drum machine behind the kit, and Spitz lays down the wicked leads that can occasionally be sun along with like a true master. Things just become spellbinding when the audience joins in singing the chorus of \u201cMadhouse\u201d, as if this classic song were equally as important as all the fanfare the band is playing from \u201cAmong The Living\u201d. And to top it all off, Belladonna throws on a baseball cap on top of his still 80s era hair and joins the rest in some good run with the immortalized rap/metal parody \u201cI\u2019m The Man\u201d.\n\nUltimately, there\u2019s never a dull moment to be found on here, every moment of music and all of the time in between have transferred perfectly from the concert to the television screen. It\u2019s extremely sad that this was to be the only offering in an extremely short rise to former glory, but this performance stands tall as the greatest live offering that the band has ever committed to DVD. If you like Anthrax, if you have the albums, and if you\u2019re still not satisfied and want a live version of these classics, this is the thing to get. The DVD has some extra songs that the CD does not, so you may want to get this one over the other if you\u2019re forced to choose. But if you want this for both your living room and your daily commutes, then get them both, and relive the brief but triumphant rebirth yet again.\n",
        "\nIn later 2005 I was suddenly filled with a sense of hope for the future. No, it wasn\u2019t because world peace was finally in our grasp, nor that aliens had landed and promised to teach us all the secrets of the universe. No it was something much greater than all of the trivial stuff, and that something was the reformation of the classic lineup of Anthrax. This was the same group of musicians that gave us the insurmountable classic speed metal magnum opus \u201cSpreading The Disease\u201d, the famed and well respected \u201cAmong The Living\u201d, and the progressive and forward looking \u201cPersistence Of Time\u201d, thus we come to further understand the trivial nature of all that other stuff that people hope for. And in true, original lineup fashion, they deliver all of the original goods with the same caliber that they did 18 years prior.\n\nFrom the first riff of \u201cAmong The Living\u201d, the signature epic thrash song that they are most recognized for, until the end of the punk inspired rocker and cover \u201cAntisocial\u201d, everything just pummels the airwaves like a ton of metallic mayhem. Belladonna hits all of the notes, usually sticking to the original melodies with little breakage, and occasionally throwing out those high end vocal gymnastics that he mostly utilized exclusively on \u201cSpreading The Disease\u201d. The monster Dan Spitz is back as well with his impressive yet high structured and memorable solos, further contemplating the retro nature of this concert. With the exceptions of Ian and Benante, everybody\u2019s hair is long, but only Belladonna has retained the exceptionally long 80s hair. But rest assured that none of these guys play or slay with their hair.\n\nFor all of the euphoria that was likely in the air the night this was filmed, both on account of the band and the fans, it is surprising that the band didn\u2019t engage in any long diatribes about this or that, and stick to getting the songs going with a few nice words in between. Audience participation is encouraged here and there, but for the most part this show is played as if it\u2019s being recorded. The set list is definitely constructed for audience approval with a disproportionate amount of songs from \u201cAmong The Living\u201d being present, but surprisingly enough the band does make a good amount of time for the other albums, including one of their earliest songs \u201cDeathrider\u201d, which is the only song on here where Belladonna seems to struggle a bit, which was the case when they played this song back in the 80s. There\u2019s very few people who can sing as ridiculously high and over the top as Neil Turbin could, but Belladonna\u2019s performance is adequate and the song kicks ass.\n\nThere are several points on this album where everything is just so together that it really stands out, though this is a solid performance all around. The first of these is \u201cNFL\u201d, where the most audience participation can be heard, and where Belladonna really comes into his own. Consistently throughout all of this band\u2019s live performances, the vocals always tend to be the best towards the middle of the show, perhaps because it takes Joey a little while to really get warmed up or maybe they put most of their best songs in the middle of the concert. Another is \u201cTime\u201d, more so because of how different it is from everything else, and how together it stays despite being a bit slower than everything else. But the pinnacle of the whole concert is \u201cMedusa\u201d, as it leaves the thrash metal realm completely and just reaches back to that early NWOBHM style that spawned the band\u2019s genre. The melodic material is extremely conducive to Belladonna\u2019s range, and also gives him an opportunity to demonstrate just how large it is.\n\nThe fact that this concert didn\u2019t lead to a studio album by this lineup was a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. Rumor has it that Scott and a couple of the others wanted to stay on tour for an extra year or so rather than record, while Belladonna was ready for a new album. Just as they did in the early 90s, things self-destructed and now essentially Anthrax is back to square one, looking to like jump on board with the modern groove/metalcore craze given the talent that they\u2019ve recruited to replace Belladonna and Spitz. Fate is a cruel thing, but thankfully this was allowed to happen before the end came yet again, and given the lack of DVD re-releases of the band\u2019s 80s concert VHS offerings, this is the album to get if you have all of the studio albums and want a true quality live performance to go with them.\n",
        "\nAlthough I am among the harshest of Anthrax\u2019s critics when it comes to the John Bush years of the band, I do have to give a level of credit where credit is due. For all of the problems that the band has had in the studio since 1993, they still get the job done on stage when it comes time to bring their music back to the masses. It\u2019s where they earned their keep as a band, and it\u2019s ultimately where they are the most at home. They repeatedly victimized themselves by bringing out lousy songs from lousy albums, but whenever the band sticks to the classics, even in the absence of a vocalist who can hit all of Belladonna\u2019s high notes, they consistently shine.\n\nThe weak link in this chain is definitely John Bush, not merely because of the self-imposed limitations that the style he\u2019s adopted sets, but also because he is not a commanding stage presence. Some of the time I have a hard time figuring out whether he, Scott Ian, or Frank Bello is actually leading the band considering all the times that the latter two come in and act like a crutch on the old material when there\u2019s something that Bush can\u2019t adequately pull off. Most of the older stuff is taken from the albums that Belladonna complains about being controlled by Ian\u2019s desire for a certain style, yet even despite the lack of classic high tenor wails in line with the earlier metal styles, Bello has to repeatedly come in to provide the top end on songs such as \u201cCaught In A Mosh\u201d, \u201cI Am The Law\u201d and \u201cIndians\u201d. To this day I still can\u2019t believe that this is the same guy who did those amazing vocals on \u201cMarch Of The Saint\u201d.\n\nFor the most part, everything else is on point, in fact in some cases when dealing with the music by itself it\u2019s exceptional. I think that the guitarist on this DVD is Robb Caggiano, but whoever it is (I just refer to him as that guy with the Mohawk); he does an excellent job emulating both Dan Spitz\u2019s idiomatic and Dimebag Darrel\u2019s wildly expressive lead contributions to these songs. Particular lead highlights can be heard on \u201cI Am The Law\u201d, \u201cRoom For One More\u201d and \u201cAnti-social\u201d. Likewise, Charlie Benante is up to his usual routine, providing a rock solid foundation to every slow groove and hyper speed thrash song with the precision of a machine and the aggression of a rabid wolverine. The only thing that can really distract from his amazing drumming is that ridiculous coon tail that Scott Ian has hanging out of his chin. Nonetheless, Ian pulls his share as well, and does a particularly nice job on that solo to \u201cGot The Time\u201d that he always loves to show off.\n\nIf you get any live offerings or anything else in either audio or video format from this era of Anthrax, this is the only one that is really worth the money, and that\u2019s only if the price is reduced to about $8 for the DVD. Most of the older stuff is worthy, though extremely flawed, while a lot of the new stuff is well performed but suffers just from being in a really boring, repetitive format. It is titled \u201cMusic Of Mass Destruction\u201d, but in truth it\u2019s more like a precision nuke, reaping havoc in a controlled manner at a few targeted points, but is otherwise not killer or even remotely close to fatal.\n",
        "\nThe gang rape of heavy and thrash metal was by no standard a pretty scene, but like any horrible occurrence of this nature, there is a moment where the terribleness of it subsides and something slightly better than what\u2019s around it emerges, almost like a temporary flight from the horrid reality that is taking place. That is basically how I\u2019d sum up the title track of this single, as \u201cOnly\u201d is pretty much the only song on \u201cSound Of White Noise\u201d to not either induce boredom or revulsion. This by no means is meant to suggest that the song is good by metal standards, only that it is not terrible by groove/grunge standards.\n\nThe riff approach is largely in line with the repetitive chord strum style that was popular among bands such as Alice In Chains and Stone Temple Pilots at this time, although occasionally a remnant of heavy metal will pop out of the verse riff and a couple of bluesy lead fills will break up the soft monotony. The guitar work could be described as Sabbath influenced in some respects, though this mostly the repetitive and extremely basic ones that manifested itself on the famous \u201cVol. 4\u201d songs \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Dream\u201d and \u201cSnowblind\u201d. The guitar solo follows a specific pattern, but cuts loose pretty well and shows Dan Spitz still has the ability to pull off something memorable when Scott Ian allows it. Bush\u2019s performance is pure Layne Staley worship, but works reasonably well here and doesn\u2019t sound forced.\n\nThe b-sides are a bit less encouraging to anyone who is hoping for a lone diamond release in the post-Belladonna era of the band. \u201cCowboy Song\u201d is basically a joke pop song that\u2019s been adapted to the sound that Anthrax has adopted here, ergo it\u2019s really sloppy, the vocal lines sound like the spiritual ancestor to Creed\u2019s Scott Stapp, and the comical nature of the melody renders the whole thing basically unworthy of listening to by anyone who likes metal. The other song \u201cSodium Pentathol\u201d sounds a bit closer to a \u201cVulgar Display Of Power\u201d interpretation of grunge, as it tries to pump a couple of repetitive, slower thrash ideas into a really muddy style, resulting in something that sounds sloppy, in much the same way that Tony Iommi\u2019s riffs would if he applied the sound he used on \u201cSabotage\u201d to a song like \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d or \u201cRattlehead\u201d.\n\nBottom line, one fairly decent groovy grunge song and not much else to show for it is how I\u2019d define this sing, and with the exception of one or two other songs, the entire \u201cSound Of White Noise\u201d album. Not to mention that everything good that came out of this era is good really only based on a limited scene of sub-par music where diamonds were few and shit was aplenty. People credit Nirvana alone with killing metal, but the truth is that it was a collective part, and to this day Scott Ian and the others still in the band seem all to willing to try and kill it again, though nowadays they can\u2019t seem to hold a consistent enough lineup to do so.\n",
        "\nAnthrax Live ( The Island Years) is a live album featuring tracks from two different Anthrax performances, with tracks 1-8 from a performance in California in 1991 and 9-12 from a performance at a New York radio station. Both are good performances by the band which features the Among The Living/Persistence of Time lineup, despite the fact that the Cd was released during the John Bush Anthrax era. \n\nThe first 8 tracks feature a good set list consisting of Anthrax's most popular songs ( Caught in a Mosh, AIR, Keep It in the Family), and some less played songs ( Parasite which is a Kiss cover, and Bring the Noise, which feature Public Enemy with Anthrax). During the concert, the band plays very well, with Joey hitting all of his notes. Also, as I am a Kiss fan I really liked the Parasite cover, which is not something regularly played by Anthrax. As always, the rhythm section of Charlie Benante, Scott Ian, and Frank Bello are flawless and really create that signature Anthrax sound. Dan Spitz plays all of the solos well, however his performance doesn't really have any great solos that stick out as being far superior to the album version solos.\n\nThe last four tracks are from the live show at the Radio station which is great. This portion of the cd is great because they play Metal Thrashing Mad, which isn't played too frequently and Now it's Dark, my favorite song off of State of Euphoria, which is also a rare song live. The only mistake on this show is about two minutes into I am the law one of the guitars stops playing, I assume due to technical difficulties. However, this just gives it a good live feel and makes the song better in the end.\n\nWhile much has been said about the production of the album being subpar, it sounds fine to me. Both shows have all of the instruments mixed well and the crowd isn't too quiet or too loud on the first 8 songs. \n\nI would recommend this album to serious Anthrax fans or any Anthrax fan looking for a good live Anthrax album. I would recommend this to serious Anthrax fans due to the performances of some less played songs like Now It's Dark and Parasite. Also, this album is good for a casual fan looking for Anthrax live album because it features alot of the most popular Anthrax songs like Caught In a Mosh and Keep It In The Family.\n",
        "\nOf the so called \"big four\" of thrash, Anthrax has always seemed to have been the underdog. While they have one of the most distinctive and most immediately recognizable sounds of the whole thrash movement, it can be difficult to pinpoint their niche. Slayer was the fastest, Megadeth was the most technical, and Metallica was the smartest (that's a rant for another day), so where does Anthrax sit? I'd say they're actually the catchiest of the four, but it seems odd that a band whose main talent is hooky writing would be so relatively forgotten in the shadow of the other three behemoths. All this pondering is moot point when one just shuts up and listens to any of the stellar Belladonna era albums though, and 1988's State of Euphoria is no exception.\n\nThe riffing style primarily on showcase here is less of the speed and quick palm muting of the previous album and more focused on memorability and weight. The riffs seem to be heavier and feature more of a weighty crush to them this time around. This kind of stomping quality has always been present thanks to Scott Ian, but this is the first time it seems to take center stage, as the three previous albums had either focused on speed or melody. I guess I'm saying there is more riffing ala \"Caught in a Mosh\" as opposed to \"Gung Ho\". The production is, thankfully, a huge step up from Among the Living. I spent the majority of my review for that album fanboyishly slurping on Benante's sugary schlong and therefore completely forgot to mention how awful the production was. There, the only the astute listener could properly dissect Bello's bass or Benante's drumwork, while here both are turned up and Charlie's bass drums and toms are as powerful as I could have ever hoped for. This most likely adds to the crunch of the riffs now that the rhythm section actually has some audible balls. The album is on the whole around the same speed as the previous, and could be seen as a logical continuation.\n\nI think the main reason that State of Euphoria is so overlooked in Anthrax's discography is the lack of classics that this record spawned. This is bullshit, but it's the way it happened. Think about it, an Anthrax show wouldn't be complete without \"Caught in a Mosh\", \"Metal Thrashing Mad\", \"Indians\", \"A.I.R.\", or any other classics from the first three albums. Hell, even the next album gave us \"Got the Time\" and \"Keep it in the Family\", but what did this spawn? \"Antisocial\"... that's it. One song, and a cover at that, seems to be what is recalled in the casual fan's mind when SoE is mentioned. Looking through their live catalog, it also seems to be the only consistent cut from this record. It's a shame that fantastic songs like \"Now it's Dark\", \"Schism\", and \"Finale\" have been so shut out to the likes of newer listeners, because they rank up there with their best. So since there aren't many live staples at work here, the album is thankfully consistently great the whole way through. This should logically help it hold up against Among the Living, but it has instead washed away as the forgotten Belladonna album.\n\nThis is just as great as any of the \"[blank] of/the [blank]\" albums, and is worthy of any Anthrax fan's attention. Despite what others say, this is only a minor step down from the previous album, and shouldn't be as overlooked as it is. There is no logical end to this review, so I shall simply take a small bow.\n",
        "\nAnybody who was listening to heavy music is the early 00\u2019s cannot deny the phenomenon of that\u2026thing\u2026they called numetal. Everybody and their mother was listening to Linkin Park, every new band on the local scenes was adding rapped lyrics to their mindless chugging, and a lot of the old-guard extreme metal bands unfortunately got on the bandwagon. But now with a lot of the genre\u2019s mainstay acts enjoying greatly diminished popularity, a lot of people think the whole thing is dead and gone. Well I got some bad news kids, numetal ain\u2019t dead. New bands spring up all of the time, but since their albums don\u2019t have \u201cLimp Bizkit\u201d or \u201cSlipknot\u201d plastered on the cover, it seems some people have deemed it groove metal or some other erroneous shitdick tag to mask its true nature. Five Finger Death Punch, for instance, is complete and total fucking mallcore shielded behind the groove tag. In fact, so is Anthrax of late. Have people completely forgotten what numetal sounds like, or are they just unwilling to admit it when one of their beloved acts starts playing it?\n\nWe\u2019ve Come For You All is the ninth Anthrax studio album and it is just as utterly terrible as one might expect by their late 90\u2019s offerings. Just as with the two abortions that preceded it, what we get with WCFYA is another blending of the groovy psuedo-thrash of late-period Pantera (\u201cWhat Doesn\u2019t Die) with vocal-oriented numetal like Puddle of Mudd (\u201cSafe Home\u201d) and the alt. rock of the Foo Fighters (\u201cTaking the Music Back\u201d). This from the band that brought us balls-out fucking thrash like that found on Spreading the Disease. There\u2019s nothing remotely similar to that album here, nor is there anything to redeem it musically. Charlie Benante is the only member with a shred of talent and he keeps all his emphasis on his double bass technique. The riffs suck, the \u2018solos\u2019 suck, the bass sucks, the lyrics suck, Scott Weiland\u2026I mean John Bush\u2019s vocals suck; the whole thing is just grating. At its best, it wishes it was Reload (the verses of \u201cAny Place But Here\u201d) and at worst\u2026.well\u2026.listen to \u201cSuperhero.\u201d Listen to that riff and the noisy guitar thing floating above it: this is something Korn would do. There\u2019s lots of distorted vocals and uninspired clean riffs too, because these are things that the mallcore crowd enjoys. And apparently Anthrax enjoys them too, because there really is a boatload of crappy gimmicks like this.\n\nThere aren\u2019t any highlights to albums like this, but how about some lowlights? \u201cWhat Doesn\u2019t Die\u201d lampoons thrash metal with low-tuned guitars and plain-Jane Pantera riffs, the kind that you can\u2019t pay attention to anyway because the vocals are so loud. And then the chorus drops all pretenses of metal for what is THE mallcore chorus of the album. Similarly, \u201cBlack Dahlia\u201d has a mock extreme metal chorus: it combines a blast beat, a generic tremolo picked riff, and distorted vocals. No thanks. \u201cTaking the Music Back\u201d has that Puddle of Mudd chorus, while \u201cThink About An End\u201d wins the \u201cmost ironic title\u201d award. I\u2019ve been thinking about an end to this shitstorm since I started playing it. And if fifty minutes of aural torment is not enough, some versions have bonus tracks\u2026\n\nThe only debatable quality to the album is as to whether or not it\u2019s really worse than Stomp 442 and Volume 8. And that, unlike \u201cthis album really fucking blows,\u201d is hard to say. It\u2019s probably just a case of whichever album you\u2019ve had to suffer through most recently. But anyway you slice it, it ain\u2019t pretty. It\u2019s numetal through and through and that\u2019s reason enough to avoid it. Add in the fact that it\u2019s Anthrax at their most embarrassing and you should be petitioning your local music stores to burn all their copies of it.\n",
        "\nThis is one of those albums that is just difficult to fully wrap yourself around. It isn\u2019t really good by any standard of an entire album, but individually there are snippets of pretty good embodiments of groove metal as first espoused by Pantera. To be fully forthcoming, I don\u2019t like this style of metal as a whole because of its tedious nature, but there are naturally some exceptions here and there. \u201cVolume 8 \u2013 The Threat Is Real\u201d puts off some pleasing musical vibes from time to time, but ultimately fails as a whole due to a complete utter lack of direction and a really jaded duality of comedy and seriousness. What manifests as a result are 3 completely unrelated approaches to songwriting, all of which clash with each other.\n\nThe first of these 3 directions, also being the strongest, is the Pantera inspired groove metal that dominates the most musically serious songs on here. John Bush\u2019s vocals sound a little closer to a Scott Weiland trying to sound like Phil Anselmo than an authentic version of said vocalist, but aside from that, songs like \u201cCrush\u201d, \u201cBorn Again Idiot\u201d and \u201cStealing From A Thief\u201d are pretty clear representations of a \u201cFar Beyond Driven\u201d approach to 90s Metal. Filling the lead guitar vacuum still being felt by Dan Spitz\u2019s absence is Dimebag, further pushing a good number of these songs in a Pantera direction. The standout song in this sort of sub-album within the album is \u201cInside Out\u201d, which basically pulls out a few interesting acoustic and clean guitar ballad ideas from \u201cThe Great Southern Trendkill\u201d and combining it with the dark and mechanical groove style dominating this album and some hard core styled vocal work that succeeds in not being completely grating.\n\nThough the generally dark and groovy guitar tone remains constant throughout the album, a lot of what is on here reverts back to the trendy alternative rock/grunge sound heard on the previous two albums, thus giving us the 2nd direction. \u201cCatharsis\u201d and \u201cPiss N\u2019 Vinegar\u201d are the worst offenders in combining lazy rock riffs, constant and repetitive amateur straight beats that Benante used to use as rest periods between thrashing and blasting, and plenty of crappy baritone yells that predict a world dominated by the mediocrity of Godsmack. \u201cAlpha Male\u201d actually combines groove metal with this shallow form of hard rock, and somehow manages to sneak in a little 7/8 meter section that goes completely unnoticed between all of the hypnotic and repetitious idea fragments.\n\nAnd then to finish off any chance of this being a consistent listen, we are offered an overlarge helping of novelty songs that makes one wonder if this is actually a Metal band trying to emulate Weird Al Yankovic. The highlights in this department are two really half-assed attempts at reviving the spirit of S.O.D. in \u201c604\u201d and \u201cCupajoe\u201d, the latter of which features Scott Ian doing the vocals. When you think about it, this sort of 30-40 second duration Hard Core style is the ideal alternative to Groove Metal because it also features 1-3 riffs yet won\u2019t waste 4 or 5 minutes of your day. \u201cToast To The Extras\u201d is a really bad Country Rock song, probably inspired by Metallica\u2019s equally terrible \u201cMomma Said\u201d, definitely something that would have been better off not being released at all, not even as a b-side to a single. Then things just sort of die off at the end with a hidden ballad dubbed \u201cPieces\u201d, basically another pop acoustic ballad in the vain of Radiohead and Goo Goo Dolls that isn\u2019t worth anyone\u2019s time.\n\nWhen all is said and done, though this doesn\u2019t quite suck as much as a lot of stuff coming out at this time, it still basically sucks. I could maybe rationalize a fan of Pantera spending 4 or 5 dollars for this in a bargain bin, but really you might as well just pick up one of their albums if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. If you are someone who is just discovering Anthrax through their early material, this is something that should not be looked into at all, nor is that the case with any other album they\u2019ve put out with John Bush. Just let these musical abortions decay away into dust and remember this band for what they contributed to the glorious time period that the 80s were for heavy metal.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on February 28, 2009.\n",
        "\nIt can be plainly stated that although Anthrax lost most of their viability when Joey Belladonna was out of the picture, that the band didn\u2019t completely die until they lost Dan Spitz and the subsequent release of this utter travesty. At this point basically anything that even resembles the good aspects of grunge and hard rock were ejected from their sound and what is left is probably the blandest and most redundant pile of groove feces possible while still just barely missing all out Mallcore territory. The Limp Bizkit tendencies are definitely here, but it still retains just enough elements of the early 90s Pantera sound to qualify as Metal in some respects.\n\nThere are actually two aspects of this album that make it superior, in a relative sense, than \u201cSound Of White Noise\u201d. The first is that the guitar tone has been cleaned up a bit so as not to sound like the mud butt soaked mess that was present before, resulting in a sound that is somewhat closer to what was heard on \u201cPersistence Of Time\u201d, though the boring as hell guitar grooves that are being used do not bring it anywhere near being enjoyable. The second being that Dimebag Darrel has been tapped to fill Spitz\u2019s shoes, and being the crazed fret board blazer that he is, actually upstages his predecessor in the technical department. \n\nMake no mistake though, what is heard on here is absolute garbage, albeit fairly well sugarcoated garbage when you account for the production quality and the improved guitar sound. Picture two nice big pieces of savory cheesecake floating in a toilet full of runny excrement and you\u2019ll have what these positive elements amount to. Each one of these songs is an exercise in sheer droning, repetitive boredom with really annoying Scott Weiland meets Fred Durst vocals. Sometimes the grooves are semi-tolerable like in the case of \u201cFueled\u201d and \u201cIn A Zone\u201d, and at other times they throw in some really ear piercing high end dissonant guitar noise like in \u201cDrop The Ball\u201d and \u201cRiding Shotgun\u201d which grates in a way that makes some of the crap on \u201cThrough The Ashes Of Empires\u201d sound pleasant by comparison.\n\nOne thing that can be said about this album which pretty well separates it from a lot of others by Anthrax\u2019s half-thrash contemporaries is that it\u2019s consistent. There isn\u2019t really a whole lot that separates one song from the next in terms of quality, baring the incorporation or removal of certain annoying guitar and vocal effects. One exception is the famed radio oriented single \u201cNothing\u201d, which drops the groove metal and hard core influences for an even duller and lamer brand of pseudo-heavy alternative rock. Picture something by Eve 6 or Sponge and then throw in a little lead guitar slot and you\u2019ve got it. The other exception is \u201cBare\u201d, which actually comes off as a joke considering that it\u2019s a poorly sung rehash of what Gin Blossoms had been doing on their acoustic music for a couple years on an album populated with bad mallcore.\n\nIf you wanted to point to a single song on here that really stands out as being good in any respect, the winner would be \u201cIn A Zone\u201d, which ventures the closest towards the \u201cSound Of White Noise\u201d character of sound. The chorus riff actually sounds pretty similar to the interlude riff heard after the guitar solo on Guns N\u2019 Roses \u201cWelcome To The Jungle\u201d, while the rest of it sounds like a fairly consistent worship session of Alice In Chains\u2019 \u201cDirt\u201d. Bush\u2019s vocals are also free of most of that really grating quasi-rapped version of vocalizing that dominates this style of music.\n\nNo self-respecting thrash band would put out something like this at all, let alone put it out and then complain in interviews later on that your labels wanted nothing to do with you because you\u2019re an old thrash metal band, because this is not thrash metal. In fact, most of it isn\u2019t even heavy metal if you\u2019re relying on standards of the genre aside from heaviness, which would qualify every single nu-metal band for the category. If you liked any of Anthrax\u2019s previous works, including the lackluster \u201cSound Of White Noise\u201d, avoid this like crazy. There are better things to do with your time, like analyzing the ass end of a cow with a really bad case of gas.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on February 28, 2009.\n",
        "\nI was reading an article on the \u201cThrash Revival\u201d the other day. It was pretty interesting, featuring interviews with a lot of the scene\u2019s key players (band members, producers, label owners). One thing in particular that caught my eye was the part of the article discussing the downfall of thrash in the 90\u2019s, in wake of grunge and numetal. Scott Ian was particularly bitter about how the labels rejected Anthrax, writing them off as a spent 80\u2019s metal band playing outdated crap. Of course, I found Scotty\u2019s woes hilarious. While I certainly feel for his plight (and all the other competent thrashers that got ousted back then), it doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that they weren\u2019t playing outdated thrash metal in the 90\u2019s: Anthrax was playing the same bullshit groove metal/modern rock that was oh-so-popular at the end of the decade (see: Pantera, Prong, Godsmack, Pro-Pain). Perhaps the mean \u2018ol labels weren\u2019t just being dicks. Perhaps they recognized that Anthrax of the 90\u2019s just plain fucking sucked. For example, their eighth album Vol. 8: The Threat is Real.\n\nThe album opens with one of those Pantera-inspired one-riff wonders that just drag their ass around without getting anything done. This one happens to be called \u201cCrush,\u201d not that it\u2019s any different than countless other \u201cWalk\u201d clones. It\u2019s shit like that this that really makes me reanalyze other 90\u2019s \u2018thrash\u2019 albums like Annihilator\u2019s King of the Kill or Sacred Reich\u2019s Heal and realize that they really weren\u2019t that bad in comparison. And when that track is finally over\u2026.Jesus, is that the Foo Fighters? No, it\u2019s track two, \u201cCatharsis,\u201d which embodies about half of the songs on this album. The other half are like track three, \u201cInside Out,\u201d i.e. shitty nu-metal. This includes track four, \u201cPiss N Vinegar.\u201d Wait a minute, is that the \u201cLocomotive Breath\u201d riff? Pretty much, buried in modern corporate \u2018metal\u2019 backwash. Track five is a flaccid attempt at recalling the good old SOD days, without either the humor or the good taste in riffage.\n\nI\u2019d have liked to criticize all of the tracks on this album like I did for Stomp 442, but this time around, it\u2019s been just too damn tiring. It\u2019s usually about track six (the hokey country-rocker \u201cToast to the Extras\u201d) that I mentally clock out of this album. The rest is basically the same bullshit from the album\u2019s beginning. Anthrax may take this material seriously, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just too fucking horrible. There\u2019s yet another hopeless SOD parody (\u201cCupajoe\u201d), one that sounds like a Rob Zombie reject (\u201cKilling Box\u201d), and a boatload of half-Pantera, half-Stone Temple Pilots backwash. Feel free to cringe at the hidden ballad too.\n\nIf Scotty is still wondering why Anthrax isn\u2019t catching on, he should know that they brought it on themselves. They still aren\u2019t playing thrash, as evidenced by a \u201905 re-recording of \u201cDeathrider\u201d that\u2019s fucking atrocious (it\u2019s played in half-time, with John Bush on vocals. Why would Charlie Benante need to play in half-time?). As of this writing they\u2019re working on a new release with a new singer, but with garbage like this and WCFYA not that far behind them, I fear for the worst. As usual, the final word here is AVOID. I know I\u2019ll never listen to this again. And you shouldn\u2019t either.\n",
        "\nThe material on this album is killer. Sadly, the album isn't. The material is that of classic Anthrax from the best known eras of the band, which happens to be 1984-1990. Yet this isn't classic Anthrax. With this album, the band at the time which consists of Benante, Bello, Ian, Caggiano, and Bush plays all the classics of the older era live.This is what you hear on the album, just covers.\n\nPlaying your own covers isn't a crime, It can actually be a good thing sometimes. Yet it just doesn't sound good. This is due to the fact that this era just DOES NOT sound like the classic Anthrax which also consists of Benante, Bello, Ian with Dan Spitz on lead guitar and Joey Belladonna on Lead Vocals. John Bush can't pull off Joey Belladonna's vocals. John Bush has a more raw voice that is better put with other thrash acts. Yet, what made this material unique was Joey Belladonna's melodic, high-pitched, powerful vocals.\n\nJohn Bush just sounds like a guy in an another metal band doing a one-off cover of Anthrax and continuing it out for 14 songs. Another element of the album that doesn't live up to the fans expectations is Rob Caggiano's leads.\nDan Spitz was a guitar player that didn't make all his guitar solos sound the same. What happened here sounds like a frustrated Caggiano who couldn't learn Dan Spitz solos, so he played random notes fast with the addition of a wah-wah pedal (i.e. Kirk Hammet). \n\nThis sounds like the late 90's era band just slaughtering the classic Anthrax material that made the band famous. It just doesn't live up to the standards that the classic line-up had left for the fans to hear and adore. To anyone who is considering buying this album, I just think it isn't worth it. Why listen to badly played classic songs like 'Deathrider', 'Indians', and 'Caught in a Mosh', when you can listen to the outstanding original versions of all these songs. \nI reccommend you buy the classic albums like anything from 'Fistful of Metal' up to 1990's 'Persistance of Time'. If you happen to see this album, just skip it. It isn't worth the time.\n",
        "\nBeing different is not something that should be done for its own sake, but when it comes to the conventional wisdom regarding the Belladonna years of Anthrax, it is something that more people ought to start doing. The fact that people who laud the decent though fairly standard \u201cAmong The Living\u201d to no end can call this bland or merely going through the motions is really perplexing, almost as perplexing as any self-respecting fan of this band\u2019s pre-90s material liking \u201cStomp 442\u201d. It might be understandable to want more development out of this album, as it does listen a little similar to the previous one, but given all the improvements and expansion of sound going on here, calling it a weak version of its predecessor just doesn\u2019t fit what I hear.\n\nAlthough we start off with a cello playing the intro riff to this album\u2019s opening song, rather than a reverb steeped group of electric guitar tracks, \u201cBe All, End All\u201d proves to be a much more epic and interesting answer to the \u201cAmong The Living\u201d question. The main riff is more memorable, Belladonna\u2019s vocals don\u2019t sound quite as forced, and things just seem to move along a lot quicker despite the longer time duration. In fact, throughout the whole album Belladonna and Spitz seem to have upped the ante in terms of quality, while Scott Ian\u2019s riff ideas just come off as much more polished and powerful.\n\nThe album\u2019s biggest strength is that despite the fact that it resembles the last one a little in throwing out some similar ideas in differing songs, the ideas are better and the mix of instruments just meld together perfectly. Benante\u2019s kit is still fairly heavy on the high end, but there is just enough more punch to the bass and snare drum on here to properly unite with the bass and give this album the bottom end that many otherwise great thrash albums seem to come up short on. It\u2019s particularly noticeable on straight up, thrashing riff monsters like \u201cOut Of Sight, Out Of Mine\u201d, \u201cSchism\u201d and \u201cMisery Loves Company\u201d. It should probably also be mentioned that this album, unlike the last one, doesn\u2019t force you to listen to a mediocre obligatory ballad and sticks to what the band does best, blazing forward at full speed.\n\nThe album does start to lag a little during the 2nd half, as the songs start to lose their epic feel and sound a bit similar to each other, but nothing on here really qualifies as filler. Sure, \u201cNow It\u2019s Dark\u201d and \u201cWho Cares Wins\u201d have some noticeable similarities in structure and feel, particularly during the verses and intros, but the band does a better job of throwing in some contrasting sections and doesn\u2019t limit their options. The only song on here that really seems to truly fall a little short of the mark is the last one \u201cFinale\u201d, which reverts back to the throw in 2 or 3 good ideas and run with them for 5 or 6 minutes trap that the last album fell into. The intro riff kicks some major league ass in a way that force-feeding Big Macs to a vegan would, but it gets itself into a really formulaic groove for most of its duration and doesn\u2019t really cook as well as the others.\n\nBut even if all of this isn\u2019t enough to convince you that this isn\u2019t the weakest Belladonna album, I\u2019ll simply refer you to \u201cMake Me Laugh\u201d, one of the top 5 songs put out by this band and better than anything on \u201cAmong The Living\u201d. Although perhaps not as witty a polemic against the abomination of televangelism as Sabbath\u2019s \u201cT.V. Crimes\u201d, the lyrics are still really hilarious. The song actually shapes itself like a conversation between one of these bible thumping profiteers and someone who\u2019s privy to their joke of a profession, switching from a happy to quasi-comical verse that parodies a church hymn to a jeering shout of the chorus over a pair of pummeling guitars. There\u2019s also that signature rapid stop start riff that Metallica basically milked for 1/3 of their hit single from \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d otherwise known as \u201cOne\u201d, but put forth in a more tasteful manner that knows the value of brevity.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t quite the melodic fit of sheer speed metal genius that \u201cSpreading The Disease\u201d was, or the classic angry epic that \u201cPersistence Of Time\u201d, this is definitely essential listening for any fan of thrash metal. The only thing that is radio-oriented about this album is the \u201cTrust\u201d cover and the fact that Belladonna\u2019s voice isn\u2019t as menacing as what you\u2019d hear on a Morbid Saint or Possessed album, but the latter applies to any album this band has ever put out. Many minds may push this to the bottom of the band\u2019s 80s albums, but such minds are best when changed.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on November 13, 2008.\n",
        "\nAfter discovering that Anthrax has done a song in which they rap, I immediately began to look for it. After finding it I expected a boring song full with rap cliches. I was wrong. This song is very fun. The guitars are heavy and the lyrics are just hilarious. This is the direction \"nu metal\" should have taken. The drums are very good (like in any Anthrax song) and the bassline is very catchy. The vocals are very strange for a metal song (yes, they are rapped) though very good. I do not know why people hate this song. The other song is Caught in a Mosh (live). I do not like this version. I can not hear the vocals and drums well, and it is something that piss me off. Another negative about this live version is that I feel that Dan Spitz and Scott Ian messed up too much in this recording. I am giving this single 75 percent because of the Caught in a Mosh live version. I recommend you to get this single instead of buying the ep because I'm The Man is repeated three times in th ep so you are not getting enough music for what you are paying.\n\nFinally, if you hate rap but are curious to see how rap and metal can mix well, get this song!\n",
        "\nIf there is one thing that albums like this one do not deserve, it is to be shelved as some sort of Solid Rocket Booster that ran its course the minute something different and more definitive was put out by the band in question. Fortunately, throughout Anthrax\u2019s career in the 80s they didn\u2019t pull a Def Leppard and disowned what got them to where they were, although much of this album was not proportionally represented on their set lists during the later 80s and then completely stripped from their live shows when Belladonna left as some sort of obsolete software program. \n\nThe label generic, when applied to this album, is extremely unfair considering that the most thrash-oriented song on here, \u201cHowling Furies\u201d, was recorded in demo format a mere matter of months after the first recording of \u201cHit the Lights\u201d, all the way the hell over in New York. Granted, the principle riff of the most popular song on here \u201cMetal Thrashing Mad\u201d is cut from the same speedier format of a NWOBHM riff that can be found on the opening thrasher from Metallica\u2019s debut and Riot\u2019s \u201cSwords and Tequilla\u201d, something of a proto-speed/thrash song from 2 years before this album was recorded, also in their native New York. But there is nothing on here that is any more or less derivative than Metallica\u2019s \u201cKill Em\u2019 All\u201d is, and this one proves to be a lot more fun.\n\n\u201cFistful of Metal\u201d listens very much like a 1983 proto-thrash album, very similar to Slayer\u2019s \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d, but without all of the occult oriented lyrics and a very different vocal approach. Neil Turbin\u2019s vocal delivery is nothing short of amazing. Even when compared against the most ridiculously flamboyant voices of the NWOBHM, the amount of rawness combined with solidly executed, glass shattering high notes dwarfs them all. The vocal delivery is not really in line with anything put out by the others in the Big 4, and even dwarfs the vocal acrobatics Blitz put forth on Overkill\u2019s first two albums. One listen to the opening blazer \u201cDeathrider\u201d, with its vintage speed riffs and endless high end siren wails, and Belladonna and company struggling in recreating what is on here live is to be expected.\n\nThe band also proves capable of slowing it down a little, though there isn\u2019t anything that comes close to being slow or subdued. The Alice Cooper cover is a fairly typical blend of faithful reproduction and an extra bit of speed and aggression to give it a metal edge that Anthrax is known for, not to mention a good display of Turbin\u2019s ability to sing in a normal ranged voice without sounding garbled or gritty like Dave Mustaine. The band\u2019s self-titled song presents an early version of the mid-tempo thrasher, kicking off with an evil slower intro that sounds quite similar to the louder part of the beginning of \u201cAmong the Living\u201d. Some of it also features ideas similar to \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d; it\u2019s something of a brainchild of their own evolving thrash formula and the time they spent with Metallica.\n\nAside from the aforementioned exceptions to the rule, the bulk of the material on here heavily resembles early Overkill speed metal. \u201cPanic\u201d, \u201cSubjugator\u201d and \u201cDeath from Above\u201d all follow simplistic structures, featuring a singular driving riff with a few variations, a singular guitar solo and repetitive vocal sections. They are all extremely memorable and fun, but they tend to lag behind the sheer intensity of \u201cDemonrider\u201d and the heavy edged \u201cHowling Furies\u201d, which is proceeded by one of Dan Spitz\u2019s finest moments as a lead guitarist \u201cAcross the River\u201d.\n\nAlthough a pretty unpopular viewpoint in thrash circles, I\u2019d put this one slightly above \u201cKill Em\u2019 All\u201d, \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d, \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d and only slightly behind Overkill\u2019s debut. It really captures that raw, unadulterated love of excessive speed and crushing guitar riff goodness that typified the early speed/thrash scene in America. It heavily resembles NWOBHM and the early German speed metal of Helloween and Running Wild, but the level of intensity sets it and the genre the band helped pioneered in a different realm. I often wonder how \u201cSpreading the Disease\u201d, the one album by Anthrax I like better than this one, would have sounded like with Turbin at the helm. The only reason why Belladonna remains the top Anthrax singer, in my personal opinion, is because he lasted longer than one album; as I am sure is the case with the question of Di\u2019anno versus Dickinson in Iron Maiden circles.\n",
        "\nNo matter what genre of music you\u2019re in, you can tell when someone is running out of ideas the minute they start reaching back to what they think are the best moments of their career. This holds true for Anthrax\u2019s last work with John Bush, which was largely a return to the \u201cSound of White Noise\u201d style of semi-metallic grunge with early signs of groove metal. Of course, this is not the best era for them musically, it\u2019s simply the best they can hope for inside the massive hole they\u2019d been digging for themselves in the previous 10 years before this.\n\n\u201cSafe Home\u201d is not metal in any way shape or form, nor is it consistently grunge if you take into account the adult alternative rock chorus and the shitty Goo Goo Dolls sounding intro. This is the kind of garbage that Jerry Cantrell would probably laugh at and whisper to a friend \u201clook at those 3 Doors Down sounding kids trying to play metal\u201d. All you would need is a few girlie sounding metalcore shouts and this could have been a ballad on the latest In Flames album. But alas, this joke would only be funny if like In Flames, Anthrax hadn\u2019t actually contributed something amazing to metal\u2019s lengthy history.\n\n\u201cTaking the Music Back\u201d is a musical confession of idea bankruptcy in both its title and its sound. It is a pure fit of self-plagiarism from their 1993 descent from metal prominence with maybe a little bit of a Velvet Revolver\u201d feel. Apparently the only thing Scott Ian and company are good at doing is ripping off ideas from the latest flavor of the month, which itself was a product of trying to bring back the supposedly better alternative rock of the early 90s (for any Atheists reading this, apply your views concerning God to this concept). \n\nWhen all is said and done, these two songs are the purest examples of what was wrong with \u201cWe\u2019ve come for you all\u201d, and why the band basically broke with John Bush afterwards. This version of Anthrax lasted for more than 10 years, as terrible as that sounds, and in that time they took four full length occasions to contradict the very meaning of their name and genre. Anthrax is not a bunch of whinny, flannel wearing, hip-hop culture zombie cunts that are perpetually pissed at the world and unable to express it in a coherent manner, it\u2019s a damned biological weapon that wipes out entire villages, ergo something that was as metal as you can get. That was what Anthrax started out as in 1982 with Neil Turbin and continued to be with Belladonna, and what they successfully killed off in one pass with the album that this single has stolen ideas from. Why should anyone like this better than even \u201cStomp 442\u201d? As utterly terrible as it was, at least it had some kind of a point aside from a trip to the musical recycling bin.\n",
        "\nAs much as I hate to say it, the title song on here is actually pretty good, in spite of its being in the worst genre of metal imaginable. Picture some of the better Pantera moments on \u201cThe Great Southern Trendkill\u201d and you\u2019ll have a good sense of how it listens. The groove section where Bush starts screaming out a slightly weaker version of Phil Anselmo\u2019s is pretty muddy and crappy, but the rest of the song is pretty tight and together. I don\u2019t know if Scott Ian is the one who plays the solo or not, but whoever it was, it\u2019s a solid rendition of some of Dimebag\u2019s early 90s material, something otherwise unheard of from a band that grooves to the beat of the all mighty core.\n\nThe rest of what is on here though, which is either more crappy groove core or absolute fucking elevator rock. \u201cGiving the Horns\u201d is a mango sized shit right on the head of the entire concept, mocking the metal genre with its primitive tribal grooves and loose assed guitar tone. One riff on here sounds close to \u201cVulgar Display of Power\u201d style Pantera, but not the positive aspects of the album, and has similarly stupid lyrics. The Radiohead cover is an absolute joke, they literally didn\u2019t do anything different with the song at all. Scott Ian basically mimics their dry rock guitar tone perfectly, Benante does the same with his snare drum, and John Bush succeeds in being a slightly manlier yet equally as out of tune version of Thom Yorke. Whether it\u2019s this version of the original, 30 minutes later I wake up, clean the drool from my chin and wonder what the hell I was doing earlier.\n\nAnthrax\u2019s utter hatred for metal may have subsided a little on \u201cVolume 8: The Threat is Real\u201d when compared to the abominable \u201cStomp 442\u201d, but their still stuck in groove land, completely under the oppressive thumb of Scott Ian\u2019s all commercialism, zero principles, sensibilities. I could maybe see downloading \u201cInside Out\u201d by itself, but I\u2019d only recommend picking up the rest of this if your planning on using it to aid in child delivery, since some anecdotal testimony suggest that the amount of sheer pain listening to \u201cGiving the Horns\u201d can make a woman in child labor forget about the pain being caused by her present condition.\n",
        "\nEvery time I hear this damned song I can\u2019t help but see that gimpy, ginger, read headed singer from Eve 6 moving his mouth to the retarded ramblings that are guising as lyrics on here. It might be because although John Bush\u2019s vocals now sound half like Scott Weiland and the rest Fred Durst, everything else around him musically is as comically shallow as that band\u2019s hit single \u201cBeautiful Oblivion\u201d or a whole bunch of other generic rock fecal matter that was steeping the radio waves with its auditory stench. We don\u2019t have riffs here, nor do we have grooves, but instead we have chords that are just strummed over and over with no fucking variation to speak of. Even third rate alternative rock knockoffs like Sponge and Tonic could do better than this.\n\nThe rest of what is on here is either only slightly better or a hell of a lot worse, if that\u2019s even possible. \u201cFueled\u201d is a huge pile of groove metal douche water fresh out of the putrid vagina of the Limp Bizkit carcass. What else can you say, half of the time Bush is rapping, and the rest of the time he sounds like a bad version of Godsmack\u2019s singer, an otherwise redundant statement. The riffs, *cough*, I mean grooves are the same sloppy 2 chord goodness that we can expect from Durst\u2019s crew of brain dead suburban gangstas. \n\nThe Iron Maiden cover goes through the motions, not adding anything new to the song other than one sloppy as hell vocal performance from John Bush, who apparently seems to be able to even fuck up a cup of coffee at this point in his career considering that \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d is probably the easiest Maiden song to sing off any album. And as for the final track (I have the European Part 1 version), more mud butt sounding down tuned guitar slop and more wildebeest mating calls from our esteemed former Armored Saint front man (god damn the mid-90s sucked in America). \n\nThe truly amazing thing is that this came out about 1 year before Freddy and da boyz actually began peddling their hot dog flavored feces to the slaves of the groove on a record label. I\u2019m not sure who I should be more pissed at for this, Scott Ian, Sepultura, Korn or Durst, but in any case this is the absolute pits if you want metal in your ears. Maybe if enough people avoid this era of Anthrax altogether, Scott Ian won\u2019t re-release any of it. We can only hope.\n",
        "\nIt can\u2019t be stated plainly enough how putrid and horrible a creature the whole grunge craze was. Everybody and their fucking mother wanted to be from Seattle at this point in history, like it was Beverly Hills or something. You had a couple of token bands who essentially embodied the best elements of what the whole scene was trying to emulate (Black Sabbath), and both of them have been included here on the archives, but even with them you didn\u2019t have any of the charm that defined the 80s metal scene at all. So the idea of a well respected thrash album imitating something so devoid of musical direction or originality seems unthinkable, unless it\u2019s 1993 and your name is Scott Ian.\n\nLeaving aside what the hell a \u201cHy Pro Glo\u201d actually is, the song itself is an up tempo rock homage to Stone Temple Pilots, and an extremely poor one at that. Picture a comical 3 note, pentatonic based, rock groove and you have about half of this song figured out already. We\u2019ve got a really dry, weak, and short as hell guitar solo that sounds like Scott Ian specifically wrote it out for Dan Spitz to play note for note; man do I feel bad for him having his good name as a guitar soloist tarnished by this piece of shit song. And as for the vocals, let\u2019s just say that if John Bush is planning on taking this horrid Layne Staley meets Scott Weiland imitation to either Broadway or Las Vegas, he would do well to make sure that all of the audience\u2019s margaritas are spiked with some pretty concentrated LSD before turning the microphone on.\n\nThe Smith\u2019s cover would be a pretty damn awesome remake if it weren\u2019t for that thin guitar tone, but even then it sounds pretty cool until John Bush\u2019s goofy vocal farts mess everything up. The live version of \u201cRoom for One More\u201d is just as groovy and muddy as the original, only Bush\u2019s vocals are hoarse and crackly, in addition to sounding like a dying cow. At least the guitar solo on here is half decent, although it sounds extremely tame compared to well conceived epic solos like on \u201cI am the Law\u201d, and uninspired when compared to the melodic sweetness heard on \u201cMedusa\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say what the bigger tragedy is here; the fact that one of the forefathers of thrash metal has been morphed into a half assed version of the now defunct STP, or that the vocalist who put his all into 4 solid Armored Saint albums ended up singing in a voice that only a rabid, nymphomaniac goat could appreciate. Avoid this at all costs, lest its poisonous sound will work it\u2019s way into your brain and transform you into a mind dead douche with a goatee, flannels, a jumbo sized inferiority complex, and a general hostility towards good music.\n",
        "\nJust when we thought that Anthrax couldn\u2019t get more neck deep in the rap metal monster they created years before, the New York based thrash pioneers throw this little curiosity our way. It seems a little odd that Chuck D and his gang of black panther uniform wearing homeboys would be down for the struggle with a band that personifies whiteness. Although this was around the time that Scott Ian was sporting his new pharaoh beard, so I guess the appearance of one band member possibly being from the Northeastern African nation was close enough to taking it to the man without Public Enemy losing any of their street cred.\n\n\u201cBring the Noise\u201d reminds us that occasionally rap can be fun, but as always it\u2019s dependent upon what is going on with the background music. The riffs are pretty repetitive and primitive sounding, and most likely leftovers from the \u201cPersistence of Time\u201d writing sessions. It\u2019s a little bit more varied than the classic Run DMC song \u201cKing of Rock\u201d, although we aren\u2019t treated to any kind of lead guitar work. Basically, as is often the case whenever Scott Ian has a limited riff well to draw from, Benante ends up carrying the song, and that\u2019s the case here as well. Nevertheless, despite this being pretty predictable, it\u2019s miles ahead of any of the garbage that Kid Rock has ever put out.\n\nThe B-sides are a slight step up, but aren\u2019t really anything that screams \u201cthis is something that I absolutely need to hear\u201d. We have a live version of \u201cKeep it in the family\u201d, which is very competently pulled off, but as a whole doesn\u2019t really showcases any wild differences from the studio version. The re-recording of \u201cI am the Law\u201d is basically the same story; we\u2019re treated to the same exact song with a crisper drum production and a heavier guitar tone. You literally can not hear any difference in Belladonna\u2019s vocal performance, which is pretty impressive considering all the abuse his voice has probably taken while on tour on and off for the past 6 years.\n\nBasically, this is adequate and pretty enjoyable, but this isn\u2019t something that is as humorous as \u201cI am the man\u201d, nor does it have a signature part that sticks in the memory. Everything just goes through the motions, sounding good when it\u2019s on, but leaving you with very little to hold onto. This material has been dispersed amongst a couple of different compilations, all of which have their fair share of crap on them as Anthrax loves their genre-bending gimmick songs and covers more than their classics, so go for the download option on this one.\n",
        "\nAnyone who tells you that thrash metal only sounds good when it clocks in at 200 plus clicks on the metronome never heard \u201cPersistence of Time\u201d. Like almost every other genre of metal, the style does not ride simply upon the tempo, but on the overall attitude of the sound. If you bring the right amount of heaviness, angst and riffs, you\u2019ll have thrash metal even when you\u2019re flirting with traditional doom metal tempos. Granted, this single doesn\u2019t slow things down that much, but this could technically be considered Anthrax\u2019s answer to \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn my world\u201d sees the perfection of the epic thrash formula that was first established on \u201cAmong the Living\u201d. Instead of simply providing a single minute intro to preface what is mostly a speed thriller, the song gradually builds from a mid tempo heavy ended rocker to a point of climax somewhere between the 4 and 5 minute mark. Dan Spitz spares no amount of intrigue during his lead break, but ultimately the punchy, gradually developed riff progressions drive this from start to finish. Anthrax has also succeeded on here in doing what Megadeth has repeatedly failed at on most of their material, which is put in a spoken narrative that doesn\u2019t sound extremely hokey.\n\nThe B-side, which also appears as a featured track on the epic 5th album, takes a peak and valley approach to the longer thrash model. Benante eases up a little on the double bass work until called for during what is assumedly the pre-chorus section, but for the most part this switches back and forth between being slow and being mid-tempo. The guitar tone and riff sets are extremely heavy, being somewhat reminiscent of Metallica\u2019s slower \u201cAnd Justice for All\u201d work, but with a solid bottom end. Belladonna\u2019s vocals are mostly in a subdued mid range shout, occasionally getting rough edged, but avoiding any of the higher vocal acrobatics of the band\u2019s mid-80s work.\n\nThis is the best of what you can expect out of the latter half of the band\u2019s tenure with this line-up. Sure it might not be as fast as what you got on the last 2 albums, but it has far more variety and staying power than most of what they offer. This is basically just one more good reason to pick up the full length album, as you don\u2019t really get much out of this that isn\u2019t there aside from the album art, which is actually pretty bland compared to most of their other singles. But if you\u2019re a rabid completist, happy hunting, as this is probably not very easy to find now.\n",
        "\nAnthrax has a unique flair for combining their finest musical moments on the album following a given single with some inspired slapstick comedy. Sadly in the case of \u201cGot the Time\u201d, the traditionally funny as hell antics accompanying the A-side have morphed into textbook buffoonery, resulting in some stuff that is basically devoid of any punch-line. I guess there is such a thing as poking too much fun at Rap and its rather unique ability to marry snippets of sampled music with babbled nonsense, because that is the only way I can explain \u201cWho put this together\u201d.\n\nOur esteemed A-side is a nice little thrashed up Joe Jackson cover that lets the genre\u2019s punk rock roots show like a thousand crazed streakers. The guitars step aside to make room for some wild and raunchy bass work, not to mention the best bass solo offering ever put forth by the band. Scott Ian also sees fit to take the soloing duties on here, as what he plays is a note for note rehash of the original version. Truth be told, although this remake really listens well, it\u2019s a pretty safe rehash with very few changes other than a heavier guitar tone and a slightly more aggressive vocal delivery.\n\nThe rest of what is on here, however, gets a little bit awkward after repeated listens. The live in Japan version of \u201cI\u2019m the Man\u201d somehow manages to drag itself out from normally being a three minute song to six minutes of ad lib antics. It\u2019s pretty funny the first couple listens, but a lot of the lengthy pauses and dialogues between the 3 mock-Beastie Boys just throw off the flow of the song. \u201cWho put this together\u201d is utterly pointless, be it when first hearing it or however many times you can stand it. It\u2019s just a bunch of sampled sounds all spliced together like a nightmare at Stockhausen\u2019s studio. A few Anthrax riffs, a lot of random voice samples, and even a few Zepplin fragments are all basically pasted together in some sort of pointless six minute joke. Picture Ice-T and Kool Moe Dee getting together for a blaze on the wacky weed and then just throwing crap together on the home studio sampler and you\u2019ll get an idea of what you can expect from this.\n\nSo all in all, great A-side and crappy B-sides are the final assessment here. You can only get away with making the same comedy routine so many times before people in the audience start to doze off and have dreams of hearing some damned thrash metal for a change. But don\u2019t let this review dissuade you from getting the absolutely essential 5th and final great album a la Anthrax \u201cPersistence of Time\u201d. The fun as hell title track on here is just a brief taste of what you\u2019ll be in store for.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s a foregone conclusion that Anthrax\u2019s \u201cState of Euphoria\u201d doesn\u2019t get as much respect as its predecessor. But regardless to the various arguments for or against the album as a whole, \u201cMake me Laugh\u201d is definitely a thrashing bad ass of a song that rivals anything that the band has done beforehand. Like most of this band\u2019s other singles, they take the opportunity during the B-sides to clown around and remind us of the satirical punk rock origins that the thrash genre takes much of its character from.\n\nOur featured A-side is definitely a force to be reckoned with, bring out most of the Anthrax arsenal in full force. It\u2019s structured in the similar thrash epic style of \u201cAmong the Living\u201d, but ratchets up the riff machine significantly. There are a couple of moments where a close variation of that crazy dual triplet riff at lightning speed that made up the faster half of Metallica\u2019s \u201cOne\u201d. Benante\u2019s drum work dwarfs anything that Lars Urlich has ever done, no pun intended, and delivers the rapid paced double bass goods with frightful precision. The only thing negative I can say about this amazing work of thrash art is that the reverb on the vocal track is way too high, and every tiny little imperfection in Belladonna\u2019s otherwise solid vocal performance sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nAs far as the other two songs on here, it can be plainly said that 1988 was the year for thrash to start covering classic 1977 punk rock. The sex pistols was probably meant as a sort of profane satire in it\u2019s original version rather than mindless slapstick, but it can\u2019t help but sound that way with all of the goofy attempts at matching Johnny Rotten\u2019s accent. Much of the song uses the same tune as that of the American patriotic song Yankee Doodle, only to some damn filthy lyrics, even by the standards of the roughest pubs in Soho. The \u201cTrust\u201d cover listens a little less like a goofy British drinking song and more like classic, fast paced, angst driven hard rock. The guitar solo is probably a little fancier than what was on the original, and the song likely didn\u2019t sound this heavy, but judging from Ian\u2019s sensibilities towards the old guard rock scene (punk or not), this is something that would be well received by the pre-Thrash crowd.\n\nThis is definitely a worthy collection of songs that did well to advertise what would become Anthrax\u2019s 4th and most underrated album. Two of these can be found on the \u201cState of Euphoria\u201d release, while the Sex Pistols remake will probably require a download. It could be argued that this was the beginning of the era where a rift was beginning to form between Ian and Belladonna, as the direction of the vocal work was drifting away from what Joey did best on \u201cSpreading the Disease\u201d, which was 80s style power metal vocals. But although his work gets a little rough, the entire package is definitely something that the band could be proud of, which is more than I can say for where they ended up after Belladonna left.\n",
        "\nFor all the cheapskates of the late 80s who didn\u2019t want to spend a few extra dollars for the extended version of this goofy rap/metal parody before there was such a thing, \u201cI\u2019m the Man\u201d also came in this fun sized version. In some respects you could say that this was the preferable version since it got rid of a pointless live version of the title track and a horrid censored version which provoked images of Tipper Gore chopping the balls off of the 1st Amendment. But unfortunately it also omitted a decent live version of \u201cI am the Law\u201d and a pretty solid remake of \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d.\n\nThere isn\u2019t really any other way to describe the title track of this single than as a cult classic amongst thrash fans. Sure, maybe it aided Faith No More in bringing about the precedent that led to nu-metal, but at least we can take comfort in knowing that abomination of a genre is literally the offspring of a complete joke, only in the case of the later crop they are trying to be serious while doing so, which doubles the laugh factor. Between the Twisted Sister sounding guitar riffs, the fairly decent Beastie Boys imitations, and the really heavily overdubbed production what comes out is quite amusing to the ears. Next to it, the \u201cCaught in a Mosh\u201d live track functions as sort of a decent after thought. It\u2019s as well executed as the studio version, with the human metronome Charlie Benante giving his usual flawless performance and Belladonna sounding a little bit hoarse, but still mostly on his game.\n\nFinding this single anywhere today would likely be next to impossible unless you combine dumb luck with a library auction or pawnshop. You will still occasionally find versions of the EP floating around, which has more goodies to offer, but also a bit of unnecessary stuff. Sadly about 10 years after Scott Ian and company conceived of this parody, they decided to morph their entire sound into it, but without the sarcasm or the slapstick. It\u2019s tough to know how to feel about the trend that this may well have started, but the song itself is all in good fun, and unlike Limp Bizkit, is executed by a band that actually knows what the hell they\u2019re doing.\n",
        "\nA good sense of humor is often an endearing trait in a thrash metal band because it helps to cancel out some of the excessive negativity that dominates the lyrics of the genre. Granted, the world itself can be a pretty negative place most of the time so you can\u2019t fault any rock or metal band for being honest, but without a little bit of laughter and a break from all of the seriousness we don\u2019t get past age 40 without a couple of strokes and a lot of happy pills. Anthrax\u2019s first single from their widely acclaimed \u201cAmong the Living\u201d album definitely provides a healthier alternative to overdosing on prescription anti-depressants, giving us a break from all the social commentary and delivering some solid entertainment.\n\nThe title track is definitely not comical in the sense that the other songs on here are, but is a very entertaining musical retelling of the Judge Dredd comic series. The principle riff that dominates the song is quite simple and repeated often, but it\u2019s always the simple parts of any song that stick in your memory. While Scott Ian and the rest of the ballsy rhythm section of this outfit provide a solid backdrop, we are also treated to one of Dan Spitz\u2019s crazier and more technically ambitious lead breaks. He has always maintained his own identity by relying more on melodic devices rather than shred up the whole time like Kirk Hammet and several others tended to at the time. And Joey Belladonna provides his best vocal performance of anything from the \u201cAmong the Living\u201d here, as he wasn\u2019t fully subjected to Scott Ian\u2019s desire for a less melodic and more shout oriented punk style at this point.\n\nThe rest of what is on here is an all out laugh fest. We are treated to a rather brilliant parody of the Beastie Boys sound in \u201cI\u2019m the Man\u201d, complete with plenty of intentionally screwed up beats, off the cuff vocal track mixing, and some of the goofiest lyrics ever put to the metal style. I don\u2019t know what is funnier; hearing Frank Bello shouting \u201cI\u2019m the Man\u201d over and over in a geeky voice or Joey constantly messing up the words and being called an idiot by Scott. \u201cBud E. Luvbomb and Satan\u2019s Lounge Band\u201d gets even more ridiculous as the band gets itself into the murky world of Lounge Swing Jazz music, among 3 or 4 other randomly selected genres. I think somewhere towards the end Charlie Benante actually plays part of the closing drum solo to Zepplins\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll\u201d. Combine all this with a really weird spoken diatribe and you end up with something not too far from Frank Zappa\u2019s timeless classic \u201cTitties and Beer\u201d.\n\nSingles and EPs are usually the place where bands get all the clowning around out of their system, and you can\u2019t really complain in Anthrax\u2019s case since they are actually pretty damn funny. Unfortunately, like even the best comedy routines, there is a limit to the amount of staying power upon repeated listens. This would definitely be worth tracking down, although the best route would be finding a place to download it since singles seem to become extremely rare after 20 years, especially if the band has subsequently released most of this stuff on a couple of compilations instead of as a box set containing all the original singles the way Helloween did.\n",
        "\nReleased to coincide with the Reunion of the \"Classic\" line-up from the Among The Living days of Belladonna, Ian, Spitz, Bello and Benante. Anthrology is a collection of all the \"greatest hits\" from the Belladonna years. Many will regard this as a poor cash-in, but is it really? On the whole, no.\n\nFirst of all, the tracklisting is stellar. To choose a greatest hits compilation from a band who had 6 unbelievably good records is no mean feat, but they've done it perfectly on here. They've chosen to focus on 2 albums per disc, Among The Living/Spreading The Disease on Disc 1, and State of Euphoria/Persistence of Time on Disc 2, and basically taken a major chunk of each album, leaving out the filler material, and then added some B-Sides and EP Tracks. The best thing about this is that you get practically all the good stuff from each album, without the rubbish tracks, and I don't mean 2 singles per album and that's it. Each album has 6 or 7 songs each, and given that most Anthrax albums are about 9-11 songs long, you can see that the bulk of each album is represented. The additional rarities are welcomed, although the French Version is not exactly necessary Anthrax listening, but enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nBut it's the songs themselves that are the best bit about the album. This album reminds you just how many good songs Anthrax have. I Am The Law, Indians, N.F.L., Got The Time, Antisocial, Madhouse, Caught In A Mosh, A.I.R., Armed And Dangerous, I'm The Man, Bring The Noize. They're all instantly recognizable to any Thrash fan, but you never really notice that they're ALL Anthrax songs until they're all together. And together they are on this compilation. Also, there's a few hidden, unappreciated gems such as Gung-Ho and Skeletons In The Closet which will just floor you.\n\nThe only complaint would be the limit of the Belladonna-only policy of the CD. There's many great Anthrax songs from the Turbin (Deathrider and Metal Thrashing Mad) and Bush eras (Only, What Doesn't Die) which are excluded, but this would mean that there'd be less Belladonna stuff and I wouldn't want to lose a single track on this compilation. All of the stuff on the disc is top class as it is, and doesn't need altering at all.\n\nAlso, the packaging is top notch. The nod to The Beatles' Anthology is a great touch and the inclusion of the band themselves in the Artwork process as well as getting them to write Liner notes is a welcome effort, after the whole \"Madhouse\" debacle where Scott Ian pubicly denounced the record label's last compilation, criticizing the crappy, half-assed artwork and scalding the laziness of the company when they got their own tracklisting wrong. It certainly beats every single official Anthrax compilation and all the cheap cash-ins you can find anywhere and everywhere.\n\nIn conclusion, this Compilation is fantastic. It is by far, the single best Anthrax compilation yet, official and unofficial. It is one of the best Thrash metal compilations ever with dozens of great songs (The scary thing is tat there's just as many great songs left off the compilation). It could be seen as an attempt to get some money out of the Belladonna reunion in the absence of any New album, but it is done with finesse and most importantly, with the band's input. It deserves to be released and to be bought because, quite simply, it's a great package. For any new Anthrax fans looking for an Introduction, buy this and Among The Living, then work your way through the albums (Especially Fistful of Metal, Persistence of Time and Sound of White Noise). At the time of the tour, this was the perfect way to get ready for the tour, as this was basically the entire setlist covered. Every song which featured on the setlist was here. In retrospect though, with no album from Belladonna before the line-up's fragmentation (Possibly a good thing? Would it have lived-up to our expectations?), this will do just fine in showing how awesome Anthrax were with Belladonna, and how fantastic the reunion was, and how they didn't potentially ruin it with new Material.\n",
        "\nAnthrax made five excellent full-lenght albums in the 80's and a couple of nice EP's as well. This was their second masterpiece that shows the classic Anthrax sound but at the same time as this one is regarded as their best album by the fans, I find this album to be the weakest with Joey Belladonna even though it's still awesome. Compared to it's predecessor \"Spreading The Disease\", this is a little more punk influenced and doesn't hold the same quality as that one either.\n\nThe opening track \"Among The Living\" is a special track with an absolutely awesome guitar intro and some great thrashin' metal afterwards. This is the best song on here and one of Anthrax' best as well. \"Caught In A Most\" and \"I Am The Law\" are probably the most famous tunes on here and they're good, there's no doubt 'bout that but they're somewhat booring compared to classics like \"Madhouse\" and \"Armed & Dangerous\" from \"S.T.D.\". \"Indians\" was another single from the album and is defenitely a better song than the previous two I mentioned. It features some killer riffing and a great guitar solo by the excellent Dan Spitz. \"One World\" is one of the best remaining tunes on here and I just totally love the riffing on that one. The last remaining tracks are all good but I can't really find anything to say 'bout 'em.\n\nThe production is good but also the worst on a Antrax w/ Joey Belladonna album. It sounds a little dry but at the same time it doesn't. The guitar sound is the main thing that irritates me. There's where the possible weakness is 'cause the drums and the bass sounds, as always, awesome. The vocals are perfect too. They've really found the perfect sound for Joey's vocals.\n\nThe cast are great. When the production let you down a bit it feels safe to know that the band doesn't. Anthrax' member are all great and highly experienced musicians. Scott and Dan's massive riffing and soloing are awesome while Frank and Charlie are building a massive ground with the drums and the bass. On top of all that, we've got one of metal's finest singers - Joey Belladonna. That man's voice is incredible and even though I used to hate it, I can tell ya that I love it know.\n\nSo finally to my last comments on \"Among The Living\"...\n\nThis album is in my opinion a little bit overrated but it's still very good and defenitely a legendary album. It defenitely hold a bag full of perfection in those tunes and I recommend this album for fans of heavy, thrash and speed metal. It's a great album and it's defenitely worth checking out.\n",
        "\nEven if Anthrax were included in the thrash metal founder\u2019s group back at the beginning of the 80s, their debut was yet in pure speed metal style and even if, from Spreading The Disease, they began to fill their sound with heavier parts, here we couldn\u2019t find them. Exodus, Slayer, Megadeth and Metallica were far more thrasher. \n\nTheir way of playing speed metal was quite particular with the good use of fast double kicks, as we can find in the opener \u201cDeathrider\u201d. The rhythms are always fast with catchy melodies and fast guitars. We can find also some hardcore influences in the riffage of a song like \u201cMetal Thrashing Mad\u201d. This is a true hymn for the first generation of thrashers and metalheads in general. Here we can find also some more thrash metal parts but everything sounds very melodic and a bit sugary if we want. \n\nThe Alice Cooper cover song \u201cI\u2019m Eighteen\u201d is perfectly done and that original atmosphere has been conserved during each and every note. The group\u2019s skills are always well visible, especially during the melodic/fast guitars solos. Neil Turbin has the classic speed metal voice, that sometimes is NWOBHM influenced, especially when it doesn\u2019t go so high in the tonality. It\u2019s good but surely not so personal and powerful. \u201cPanic is remarkable for the great Iron maiden style solos and for Benante\u2019s way of playing the drums: he\u2019s always excellent, precise and restless.\n\nThe other songs are always quite enjoyable but they cannot compete with the goodness of the first three ones. Sometimes there is some filler parts in some songs that could be perfect without even just one minute of music. It\u2019s the case of \u201cSubjugator\u201d or \u201cDeath From Above\u201d. \u201cSoldiers of Metal\u201d is quite funny for the childish lyrics and it\u2019s understandable for the period. Anyway, it seems to me that going on, the album loses in impact and ideas, becoming a bit too monotonous and boring.\n\nThe only remarkable song is \u201cHowling Furies\u201d for the apocalyptic, murky atmosphere. The riffs here are better structured and less impulsive, re-conquering some good ideas. At the end, this Fistful Of Metal presented us a young band that was growing musically and technically; a band that was more speed metal oriented than thrash but everything already sounds quite good. It\u2019s difficult to put out a masterpiece for a debut and surely Anthrax didn\u2019t do it but it\u2019s a good way of discovering early 80s sonorities.\n",
        "\nOkay, so the album does have new vocalist, John Bush, and the album has some very 'soft' or over-melodic radio friendly sections, there is still plenty of material to be found here that is a logical follow up to \"Persistence Of Time\". Their last album with Joey Belladonna already was an album with not much fast or thrashing songs but still remakably excellent. And that line is proceeded right here.\n\nIf you listen to \"Potters Field\", \"Room For One More\" and \"Burst\" and try to image Joey Belladonna singing these songs it becomes obvious these songs are pretty much a continuation of the slower and dark style of their previous album \"Persistence of Time\". These songs would easily get 90-95 points from me. \"Invisble\" follows closely and is a pretty good song but is a further step away from their previous effort.\n\nIt's with songs like \"HyProGlo\", \"1000 Points Of Hate\" and especially \"Packaged Rebellion\" that the band starts to sound like a loud grunge collective playing along with John Bush instead of the mighty Anthrax with a new vocalist. Closing song \"This Is Not An Exit\" is simply extremely dull and has too much of a doomy Alice In Chains feeling surrounding it. Songs like these really damage the album. \"Only\" and \"Sodium Pentathol\" are better and build a bridge between the grungy songs and earlier Anthrax. \n\nThen there is a personal favorite. Despite the fact that it didn't sound anything like Anthrax, the dark ballad \"Black Lodge\" simply is too good to be ignored here. As said it has the atmosphere of a ballad but the verses sound dark enough not to become cheesy. Furthermore the guitar harmony in the middle is beautiful.\n\nSo, apart from four bad songs and a production that should have been a lot heavier (especially guitarwise) there is still plenty quality stuff to be found here making it worth owning this album if you're an Anthrax fan.\n",
        "\nAs whole I like \u201cPersistence of Time\u201d better than \u201cState Of Euphoria\u201d but I prefer my favorite songs on \u201cState Of Euphoria\u201d to my favorites on \u201cPersistence of Time\u201d. Are you still with me? What I\u2019m trying to say is that I find \u201cPersistence\u2026\u201d more consistent a but lacking some real individual classics.\n\nI always has a soft spot for the opening track \u201cTime\u201d but the song was never quite as good in the live environment. This song is also a fan favorite and the way the intro processes into the song in simple but effective and very memorable. Other highlights include the catchy \u201cIn My World\u201d and \u201cBelly Of The Beast\u201d (including the beautiful intro \u201cIntro To Reality\u201d). Both these songs are never really fast raging thrash metal but they are incredibly catchy and feature some great riffs and a superb vocal performance. The groovy song \u201cBlood\u201d is long but never gets boring and has plenty of dynamics and changes in pace. The \u201cImagine, Imagine\u201d prechorus is simply outstanding!\n\nWith the duo \u201cGridlock\u201d (great intro riff though) and \u201cOne Man Stands\u201d (great chorus) the band delivers two good songs but not brilliant. \u201cH8tred\u201d and \u201cDischarge\u201d are decent but to be honest can be considered fillers. Whereas \u201cDischarge\u201d has plenty of power it can not compete with the best songs on this album. \u201cH8tred\u201d compositionally sounds a lot already like the kind of material the band would start writing with John Bush.\n\nThe production was close to flawless and sounds pretty heavy and tight. The lyrics continue the path of seriousness set in by a lot of songs on \u201cState Of Euphoria\u201d and also the album art has a darker image making it easier for some of the more conservative metal fans to get into this album. \n\nPersonally I prefer an album with some more up tempo material (you won\u2019t find a Gung Ho, Finale or Imitation Of Life here) but the whole concept of this album came really close to the quality of their \u201cSpreading\u2026\u201d and \u201cAmong\u2026\u201d albums, therefor becoming the third best Anthrax album ever. And that is saying a lot of coure.\n",
        "\nNothing spectacular about this debut by Anthrax except for four very good songs. Most of this album is still build around NWOBHM riffs and melodies (and even an Alice Cooper cover) and some up tempo speed metal material comparible to early Metallica. But still a far cry from the type of music we\u2019d now like to call thrash metal. \u201cFistful Of Metal\u201d is a decent album with a few highlights.\n\nThere are two songs here that are an omen of the thrash metal side of Anthrax. Ultimately these songs are also two of the best songs on the album. I am talking about \u201cDeathrider\u201dand \u201cPanic\u201d. These songs are very similar to the song \u201cGung Ho\u201d on the next Anthrax album. Up tempo, faily simple, cathcy vocal lines and especially \u201cPanic\u201d has a brilliant solo section in the middle.\n\nThen there is of course the anthem \u201cMetal Thrashing Mad\u201d which also is a step ahead of the rest of the album in terms of being more speed metal already and reminiscent of their next album. Last but not least I must mention \u201cHowling Furies\u201d which is in fact more NWOBHM than later Anthrax but simply a very good song with a catchy opening riff.\n\nNeil Turbin is an adequate vocalist. But as we all know his successor Joey Belladonna focussed more on the melodies which proved very successful for Anthrax in years to come. Neil balances between some melody and standard raw metal vocals and sounds decent but never stands out.\n\nDan Lilker co-wrote some material but he still has a serving role on these recordings. Nothing spectacular about his parts here. I\u2019m glad he, Scott and Charlie later on (after Dan had left Anthrax) did something else which suited them so much better (S.O.D.).\n\nI do not dislike this album but I obviously prefer the next 5 Anthrax albums. The earlier mentioned four songs however are the kind of songs we\u2019ve all been hoping Anthrax would once again start to writing after they musically crashed on Stomp442! Ohw, and just like the debut albums by Metallica, Slayer and Megadeth, the Anthrax debut also features one of the worst album covers in thrash metal history. Something they all got right the second time!\n",
        "\nThe best argument against \u201cState of Euphoria\u201d is that it\u2019s the worst studio album with Joey Belladonna. Having said that I must add that this by no means suggests that it also is a bad album. It simply is good but not brilliant. And we, the Anthrax fans, want brilliant albums. Unfortunately only half of this album was worthy of their legacy and the rest were fillers.\n\nOpener \u201cBe All, End All\u201d simply continues where Among The Living had ended. A mixture of stomping thrash metal with some crossover riffs and highly melodic and catchy vocal lines. Another highlight is the epic \u201cWho Cares Wins\u201d which followes the path of earlier classic \u201cADI/The Horror Of It All\u201d and incorporates a wide spectrum of thrash metal paces and atmospheres. Third brilliant song is closing tune \u201cFinale\u201d which is up tempo, catchy, powerful and has some of the best riff on the entire album but has become somewhat of a forgotten classic.\n\nJust behind these three mighty songs there are two very good songs. I\u2019m talking about \u201cOut Of Sight, Out Of Mind\u201d and \u201cNow It's Dark\u201d here. Which both have excellent riffs, great dynamics and an excellent chorus.\n\nThen we have the rest of the album. The threesome \u201cMake Me Laugh\u201d, \u201cSchism\u201d and \u201cMisery Loves Company\u201d are fillers. There are some enjoyable moments but compositionally these songs simply are not impressive enough for Anthrax standards. I\u2019ve never had a problem with the short joke \u201c13\u201d because it\u2019s so short and \u201cAntisocial\u201d is way better than the original by French band Trust but most of the time I skip this song. I guess I heard it too many times.\n\nSo you see, 5 out of ten songs are very good or genius and the rest are just okay. There\u2019s not a song here that\u2019s I\u2019d call really bad or horrible. Just adequate fillers. As a whole, good album, not great.\n",
        "\nTogether with \u201cSpreading The Disease\u201d this album has gone into history as being an ultimate Anthrax album. Once again this is an album, worshipped by many and incidentally trivialised by a small group calling themselves thrashers but who were between 0 and 5 years old when this came out. Fortunately most younger thrashers eventually learn to appreciate this masterpiece. \n\nOkay, just brainstorming for a second. What if Charlie and Scott never did S.O.D.? If one listens to Among The Living unbiased (or at least without emotions) and keeps in mind the period in which it was written, the elements of crossover and speed metal, it becomes so clear that Among The Living was simply the ultimate mix of \u201cSpeak English Or Die\u201d and \u201cSpreading The Disease\u201d. Speed Metal played with crossover riffs and intensity, resulting in that typical Anthrax form of stomping thrash metal.\n\nThis new found style aka symbiosis on itself is of course not enough to create a classic album. The time in which this was done as well as the quality of the individual songs and performance are also important conditions. In 1987 thrash metal was out of the underground dungeons and bands started develloping the style even further. Metallica was getting more epic and melodic, Slayer had just made a point with a short and fast album that oozed a hardcore punk attitude etcetera etcetera. Anthrax re-invented themselves on this album and went beyong their earliest form of NWOBHM influenced speed metal. \n\nSecondly as said the individual songs are varying from good to genius here. There is not a single bad song or filler here. \u201cSkeleton in the Closet\u201d is a forgotten classic because they other songs are simply better. But if this song had been on any other Anthrax album it would have been one of the better or even best songs. In the live environment however this song was a little too long.\n\nThe two most famous songs are \u201cIndians\u201d and \u201cI Am The Law\u201d. \u201cIndians\u201d starts off with a great native american beat and harmony before plunging into raging thrash metal with a great catchy chorus and a fabulous stomping bridge in the middle (\u201cWardance!!!\u201d). \u201cI am the Law\u201d is mostly mid paced but speeds up near the end, which is exactly what the song needs at that point. A classic example of effective songwriting.\n\nThird place must be \u201cCaught In A Mosh\u201d which is a personal favorite and one of the most aggressive songs on the album together with \u201cImitation Of Life\u201d. These two songs are not as straight forward as \u201cGung Ho\u201d or \u201cPanic\u201d on earlier albums but just as strong and actually even more impressive because of the variation within these songs without losing power.\n\nThe title track \u201cAmong The Living\u201d and \u201cEfilnikufesin (N.F.L.)\u201d are catchy, powerful and have a good balance between a sense of eeriness, melodic vocals and moshing power. The title of the last mentioned song has become somewhat of a running gag on later releases. So what about \u201cOne World \u201d and \u201cA.D.I. / Horror of It All\u201d? Well \u201cOne World\u201d has great riffs and a mighty chorus (also the \u201cOne, Two - NOT! Three, Four - DIE! \u201d is a brilliant catchy highlight on the album) and \u201cA.D.I. / Horror of It All\u201d is simply a lengthy thrashing monster of epic proportions!\n\nSo much for the songs. Now for the perfomance and sound. The performance is great. Anthrax did consist of some of the best musicians in thrash metal at that time so not much to complain there. Scott and Charlie were two of the tightest playing thrashers around and Dan Spitz puts just enough melody in his leads to make them stand out and still sound powerful. Frank Bello, playing with fingers and not a pick, has a typical plucking sound and can easily be heard through the guitar assault. He also really adds something to the music. Last but not least there was Joey. One of the most melodic vocalist in thrash metal and the finishing touch to their mighty sound.\n\nThe production balanced between \u2018suiting\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019 for 1987 standards. It\u2019s very organic and honest and none of the instruments have the upper hand. The only production I know of that was beter than this one was Persistence Of Time and I wonder what Among would have sounded like with that sound.\n\nSimply said there is nothing here to complain about. All things fell into place on \u201cAmong The Living\u201d and Anthrax (unfortunately) never equalled this masterpiece. Mosh It Up!\n",
        "\nANTHRAX - FISTFUL OF METAL\n\nAnthrax were well known in their time for being one of the more distinctive and unique thrash bands of their day despite never touching on much new ground as far as influence or innovation was concerned. Even to this day Anthrax's main legacy was influence on mallcore, stemming from their cover/remix of Public Enemy's \"Bring The Noise\". However Anthrax did not know this when starting out, and they were simply a band trying to make a name for themselves. \n\nThe music presented on this release isn't completely thrash, it has alot of traditional heavy metal influence on it still and at times even sounds like a more aggressive/souped up version of Judas Priest crossed with Iron Maiden. Most of the guitar solos here are harmonic heavy, and Neil Turban sounds like a stereotypical traditional metal vocalist almost entirely. Only \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" and \"Howling Furies\" have distinctive thrash elements, with the first of them being the direct border between speed and thrash. The rest is pure Speed Metal for the most part. The riffs aren't particularly fast or grabbing save for a few great riffs such as the opening riff for \"Panic\". The drum work sounds bland and pretty uninspired for the most part. The guitar work turned in here is more then solid although not really anthrax. \n\nSome highlights include \"Metal Thrashing Mad\", \"Deathrider\", \"Howling Furies\" and the cheesy and fun \"Soldiers of Metal\". All of these songs are executed well to enough of an extent that they ought to be on Anthrax's setlist from time to time. \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" is a true speed/thrash metal anthem and combines the best elements of both genres into some catchy vox and catchy riffs. Easily a must-own song for any thrasher. \"Deathrider\" is a nice opening to the album, and has possibly the coolest riffs on here. \"Howling Furies\" wouldn't be out of place on a later Anthrax album such as \"Spreading the Disease\" if it wasn't for the vocals. Easily the thrashiest song on here, and easily worthy of a highlight spot. \"Soldiers of Metal\" has cool drumming, and a really nice chugging riff. Its just a general metal anthem that is executed well by the band. \n\nThe lowlights are the recurring feelings or oddness on alot of these tracks. Alot of solo's sound almost like deja vu from a Judas Priest album, not to mention that the vocals just sound downright repetitive half the time. The riffs aren't that amazing, and while their solidly memorable their is too much chugging even for a speed metal album. In general this album provides primitive, fun and occasionally catchy speed metal. Its not that its not worth listening to, its that its downright weak compared to other Anthrax releases from later in their career. Of course it still has value and deserves a listen every once in a while for sure. I'll admit it took me a while to really appreciate this one, but having listened to alot more traditional heavy metal/NWOBHM made me appreciate this a lot more. So in the end, while not Anthrax's best, Fistful of Metal is not that bad a album after all. It may be one step away from thrash, but its a downright competent debut.\n\nConclusion: Pretty much an average album of Speed Metal, but worth getting easily. One step away from thrash and being truly good, but definitly an average album in the genre its in.\n",
        "\nAnthrax have made a bunch of excellent thrash metal albums over their exsistence. Some have been more succeeded and some less. Anthrax most famous albums were done in the second half of the 80's and early 90's with singer Joey Belladonna but still it was \"Spreading The Disease\" and \"Among The Living\" that got really big. \"State Of Euphoria\" and this one, \"Persistence Of Time\" was successes but not as big as the other two... They should've been that! I usually rate \"Among The Living\" as the weakest Anthrax-w/Joey album and \"Persistence Of Time\" is actually their second best album of all time. Why? Well, that what I'm gonna explain right here, right now...\n\nAnthrax always had great subjects with their albums that featured Joey Belladonna, and so has this album. Time is something that's involving everyone in the whole world and time can be really interesting depending on what the subject is about. I like their direction of making an album about time. It's interesting. This album's filled with a lot of lengthy songs without getting dry and the whole album is kinda dark and epic sometimes.\n\nThe opening track is called \"Time\" and it's a really heavy track that immediately show you that Anthrax still got it and it's also a little reminding of the whole \"State Of Euphoria\" thing. \"Blood\" sounds like there's war in hell and Satan takes his troops to destroy the attacking enemy. This albums heaviest track is defenitely \"Keep It In The Family\". It's so heavy that you just bang your head while it feels like you get your ass kicked by a giant boot. \"In My World\" is probably the biggest highlight here. It's just so perfect with some perfect riffs to a great and catchy chorus while Dan's solo is awesome. The fastest song is \"Gridlock\", not the best one but still a killer. \"Intro To Reality / Belly Of The Best\" are probably my favorite next after \"In My World\". \"Intro To Reality\" is a pretty little acoustic guitar track that later goes into the catchy hell of \"Belly Of The Beast\" which has Joey Belladonna on top. The cover of Joe Jackson's \"Got The Time\" is really catchy while \"H8 Red\" is probably the most booring song here even though it's still good. \"One Man Stands\" and \"Discharge\" are two heavy tracks that can spell \"perfection\", they're both awesome.\n\nThe production is really nice. Like the other Anthrax albums this one has a different sound but it still sounds like good ole Anthrax. The whole thing is as I mentioned before, darker and a little epic. The drums is just breaking. They just blasts out some thrashin' madness which is followed by crushing guitars and a crushing bass. Joey Belladonna's vocals sounds (as usual) awesome. A lot of the perfection on Anthrax's albums are the vocals.\n\nThe cast is doing great. These five guys are some of the best musicians in the metal business. Joey Belladonna has one of the absolutely greatest voices in metal history while Scott Ian is a fantastic rhythm guitarist. Dan Spitz's doing a whole bunch of insane solos here while Frank Bello and Charlie Benante are two of the most insane musicians ever. Everyone's great and the only time it's been better (in my opinion) is on \"Spreading The Disease\".\n\nSo finally to my last comments on \"Persistence Of Time\".....\n\nEvery track is awesome. This album's almost perfect, the only thing is that not all tracks are 11 out of 10 but just 10 out of 10. My personal recommendations would be: In My World, Belly Of The Beast, Time and Keep It In The Family. All tracks are awesome though. I really recommend this album, it's great in any way. You can bang your head, swing along or just relax to it. There's eleven of the finest thrash pieces you can find on one CD and Anthrax is the author of them. If you find this album then I strongly sugest that you check it out 'cause it's worth it. Believe me! This was the very last masterpiece they did. They will probably never come up to this quality again so let's keep the memory of the classics alive by listening to them. Anthrax forever!\n",
        "\nOf the Big Four of thrash metal, Anthrax is always the most overlooked. Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer have legions of fans across countries yet undiscovered, while Anthrax has to make do with the smaller, yet entirely more rabid, fanbase they currently have. How it was in1987? I'll never know, I'm a young'un, I wasn't around then. But as of now, they are the least appreciated of the Big Four.\n\nAmong the Living is their most popular of the 80s material right next to Spreading the Disease, and it is easy to see why. Among the Living stands as my favorite Anthrax release, as it is the perfect blend of the New York style thrash and hardcore punk tinges they've always had. This has far more thrash than punk though, but the blend is still there. Scott Ian is one of the \"faces\" of metal. He's the guy who's always on TV, always promoting, always giving 130% on stage, and always being the center of energy and attention with the band. He's not the most impressive guitarist in terms of technicality, but he is one hell of a riff writer. In fact, the entire band was almost perfect around this time, barring Joey Belladonna. I've never been a huge fan of his voice, it fits fine, but it just isn't very good for the most part. Listen to that scream around three minutes into Caught in a Mosh..... that's right, he's not very good. Dan Spitz plays good leads on the rare occasion they show up, and Frank Bello is a competent bassist, although he doesn't get too many standout part. Then there is Charlie Benante, one of my favorite thrash drummers of all time. Really the only people he's behind are absolute gods (Gene Hoglan, Dave Lombardo), so it's should be a testament to how great he really is. He keeps in time greatly and has some spectacular fills. Not to mention he is extremely fast as well as he is precise, almost on a Hoglan-esque level, just not quite.\n\nThe production is nothing to shout about. Clean, yet thrash-like. Nothing super spectacular, but nothing shitty either, so not much can be said.\n\nThe last three songs aren't as great as the first six, as they kind of run together and are a tad overlong, which is bad considering Imitation of Life is the shortest song on the album. The last three just get kind of boring, whereas the first six are astounding and you are honestly upset when they are over. None of the songs are overtly megafast, but none of them really plod barring the final triad (in case you can't tell, those are the only bad parts of the album). The lyrical themes are pretty diverse, ranging from disrespectful fools (Caught in a Mosh), comic book characters (I am the Law), Stephen King (A Skeleton in the Closet), history (Indians), and even John Belushi (Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)).\n\nI'll start with the positives this review, and that is the first six tracks. Among the Living takes a little bit to start, but once Benante's pounding rolls around the 1:30 mark thunder through, the song picks up with his awesome double bass and a fast as fuck thrash riff. Most of the album you'll find yourself noticing the drum patterns above the riffs, which really shouldn't happen in thrash, much less NY thrash where the riffs take prevalence over most everything else, but that's just what happens when you have Benante on the kit. Despite that observation, this is actually almost the epitome of NY thrash, with only Overkill doing better. The mosh riffs, the shouted gang choruses, it's all here, and it's here in fucking force.\n\nEfilnikufesin is easily the greatest thrash song about a dead comedian, hands down. Do you hear any Bill Hicks or Mitch Hedburg tributes? No? Well then I guess this wins by default, but that doesn't stop if from ruling. It's got one catchy fucking chorus, as does the rest of the whole album really. Try not to sing along to A Skeleton in the Closet, it's a physical impossibility, they proved it on Mythbusters. Actually, the aforementioned song ranks as one of my favorites because it's a song based on literature that doesn't drag itself out over the course of a whole album like certain power and prog bands tend to do (it's based off Stephen King's short story Apt Pupil from A Change of Seasons), not to mention the drumming is, once again, phenomenal.\n\nAlright, that paragraph would be a tedious and redundant read if I said what was great about each song, because, while indeed different, I had to delete a large chunk of that paragraph after realizing how much I repeated myself. One World has a pretty boring chorus, but I will say that The Horror of it All would be perfect if it weren't for that intro. And that's about all there is to be said about the negative aspect.\n\nSo what I'm trying to say is that this is a great album and shouldn't be missed by any thrash maniacs. Anthrax remains the most underrated of the Big Four and this album deserves a fuckload more respect than it actually gets. An A- for Anthrax. I'd love to give it higher, because the first two thirds are nuts, but the end kind of kills it a bit. Otherwise it's a great NY thrash record on par with some of Overkill's best, albeit a slightly different style.\n\nAnd oh yeah, Charlie Benante.\n",
        "\nThe question of how one ends up being \u201cTHE MAN!!\u201d all boils down to one\u2019s superior mastery of the fine art of novelty. In this respect, one has to hand the cheese wiz award to Anthrax for successfully parodying the novelty of rap as embodied in Run D MC\u2019s \u201cKing of Rock\u201d and the rock/rap party-till-you-puke craziness of the Beastie Boys. So now that all the homeboys are down with the plan, let\u2019s get right to analyzing this collection of beats and bangs.\n\nThe boys give us 3 versions of the same jam, the only one being worth your time being the uncensored version as one hardly needs to be bothered with all of that Tipper Gore bleep out action going on in the censored version, let alone the needless crowd noise accompanying the live one. Suffice to say, this song is pretty damned funny, particularly if you keep the subject of parody at the time in context. The overly reverb drenched \u201cOw, Ows\u201d and the kooky verses somehow manage to mesh themselves with the irregular beat changeups that synthesize the record scratches peculiar to the Old School rap sound and the happy mid tempo punk riffs. The real punch line in this epic joke of a song is that 10 years or so after this was concocted empty headed dumb asses like Kid Rock and Fred Durst thought they were being original by creating the same thing, only actually being serious in the process, which is doubly amusing.\n\nBut the joke doesn\u2019t end with these 5 New York thrashers shouting from a mountain top that they are the man. Oh no, it\u2019s time we cover some poor hapless Black Sabbath tunes, craft them in a fairly original and quality fashion, and then fart ourselves another greasy, queef loving joke to try and get the listener back in stitches. Unfortunately, in the case of \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d, which is actually pretty well done considering they turned it into a slightly faster, all electric rocker; the joke leaves the realms of good taste. I mean putting in a little fade out reference to \u2018Sweet Leaf\u201d is one thing, but then just blasting out a bunch of random profanity and essentially goofing up a decent cover is the equivalent of prescribing a used douche as a treatment. I\u2019m not talking about simply putting new water into an already discharged unit, but actually taking the time to collect all the spilled water from the previous douching and somehow putting it back in the same unit, which would likely not be funny to whoever was your next hapless patient. Thankfully we have some decent live versions of two classics from \u201cAmong the Living\u201d to make up for it, but I nearly was of a mind to yank Anthrax\u2019s hard won cheese wiz award after that one.\n\nIf you like your metal/rap hilariously funny and pure 100% original grade, I say it\u2019s time to part with some of those portraits of long since deceased presidents in the name of being the man. And if you really want to be the man, break the truth to all of your Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit worshipping friends that the music they love is an unoriginal attempt at turning an obvious spoof into a style of music. You may find that the nu-metal poser spirit that has possessed them will die away, shrieking in agony and a true metal newbie could well emerge in its absence.\n",
        "\nBy the time that \u201cAmong the Living\u201d hit the stores, Thrash metal was out of the hellish underground and in the faces of everyone with eardrums in need of a good busting. With all the competition that this entailed, Anthrax was sort of pushed off to the side by more extreme acts such as Slayer in terms of being a revolutionary force, though they did maintain a large following and Scott Ian was wherever the cameras were. In some respects it is unfortunate that this ended up happening to the band, but it\u2019s hard to compete with something as brutal as Reign in Blood and the emerging death metal scene it helped inspire without sounding light in comparison.\n\nUnlike its two predecessors, both of which were timeless masterpieces, this album is mired by too much standardization and not enough risk taking. It tends more towards the punk side of the thrash coin, complete with loads of minimalist riffs and shouted backup vocal slots. Ultimately this format works well for everyone in Anthrax except for Joey Belladonna, whose voice bears more similarity to the original NWOBHM singers rather than gritty shouters like Tom Araya and Billy Milano, who would fit in quite well in the underground punk scene. He does the best he can, but you can tell that his voice doesn\u2019t naturally do what Scott Ian was likely demanding of it.\n\nAll things considered, this album is well realized, but sort of tapers off in the second half due to some recycled ideas. The first half of the album is amazing, trading blows between raucous mosh pit riff monsters like \u201cCaught in a Mosh\u201d and the politically conscious thrash epic title track. Up until the end of \u201cSkeletons in the Closet\u201d, which sports a solid gallop riff, the pit brutality and melodically inspired solos of Dan Spitz don\u2019t relent for a second. Everything just makes you want to throw your fist in the air and shout chant-like praises to the gods of thrash.\n\nAfter that, things sort of gradually die down and resolve on a somewhat unresolved note. \u201cIndians\u201d and \u201cOne World\u201d are both solid thrashers with interesting intros, but you can\u2019t help but pick out bits and pieces from early songs. \u201cA.D.I./Horror of it all\u201d is a little too long for its own good, as the kind of simple thrash Anthrax deals in is not as conducive to the 7 minute plus epic the way Metallica\u2019s early stuff was. \u201cImitation of Life\u201d starts off slow and tired sounding, then picks up to rocket speed with Belladonna shrieking away as best he can. It\u2019s not bad, but I wouldn\u2019t quite put it up to the same caliber as \u201cGung Ho\u201d was.\n\nObviously this album would fit in well in any metal head\u2019s collection, but I think it gets a bit too much credit when shacked up against \u201cFistful of Metal\u201d and \u201cSpreading the Disease\u201d. It cooks with the best of them, although sometimes the drums upstage the guitars and Belladonna\u2019s voice clashes with the arrangement. This is still Anthrax before Scott Ian established himself as one of many heavy metal weathervanes who would twist with the winds of public opinion on what was considered good music, rather than sticking to what actually was good music.\n",
        "\nI really don't know why people don't like this album as much as the others. I think it's great. Sure it has some weaker moments but it has some of Anthrax' highest and best moments too.\n\nThe albums starts off with an excellent track called \"Be All, End All\". It starts off with a pretty anoying intro made on a violin (or something like that) but then it goes into Anthrax perfection all the way. Next track is \"Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind\". A track based on a cool guitar riff which screams Anthrax. Track 3 and 4 are the best here, it's \"Make Me Laugh\" and \"Now It's Dark\". It was those two tracks that got me interested in this album. Some other killers here are \"Final\u00e9\" and \"Who Cares Wins\" while there's the weaker \"Misery Loves Company\" and the totally unnecessary \"13\".\n\nThe production is great. Maybe a little dry but still awesome. I like the drum sounds very much and the guitar solos got a nice tone aswell. The vocals are mixed nice as usual and the bass aswell as the rhythm guitars sounds great too.\n\nThe cast is doing great, maybe their greatest performances ever. I don't know but they're really good on this album. I think the greatest performance here are made by either Charlie or Joey. They are on top here!\n\nSo what's my last comments about \"State Of Euphoria\". Well, it's a great album and a Anthrax classic that every fan should have. It's heavily underrated too. It deserves a lot more appreciasion that it has.\n\nI think you should dig it up, it's defenitely worth a purchase!\n",
        "\nThis might be my personal favorite by Anthrax but it's still hard to say since all of their albums with Joey Belladonna are great. Anyway, I'm gonna try to get me feelings about this masterpiece into this review so you can get a clue about the greatness of this album... So here we go!\n\nThe first song I ever heard by Anthrax was \"Madhouse\" and I had a really hard time to accept Joey Belladonna's voice. Actually, it took me maybe 2-3 years but now I love it and even though \"Madhouse\" probably is their biggest hit and a real \"headbanger's ball\" classic, it's still not much of what this album's about. Actually, it doesn't have much at all to tell about this album. There are several tunes that could have been \"headbanger's ball\" classics. Take \"Medusa\" for example, it's a great and really catchy tune which happens to be a classic today. It could have been maybe just as big as \"Madhouse\" and it's not even like that one. Some other classics that also could have made it big are \"A.I.R.\", \"Armed And Dangerous\" and \"Gung-Ho\". \"Armed And Dangerous\" is maybe the best tune on this album. It has everything. Great acoustic opening with some whisteling before the vocals and drums comes in and it's so beautiful that I almost want to cry. It then explodes into a thrash metal masterpiece, just awesome and so are the most of the album.\n\nThe production is weird. I love the guitar sound but then somehow I feel like everything sounds like it was recorded from an old radio and put on vinyl. It's like I'm having a hate / love relationship to the production. I like it but at the same time I think it's sounds like I playing it through a bad radio. I still have to admit that the production is pretty cheap but still awesome. It's just the way it is. Another great thing here is that all the instruments are balanced unlike \"Fistful Of Metal\" where the drums and the bass was pretty much dominating through the whole album.\n\nThe cast is doing a great job. I thought Charlie Benante was fabulous on \"Fistful Of Metal\" but here he's even more experienced and better. Blowing fast and great as hell on the drums. Scott Ian and Dan Spitz are both doing a great job with the rhythm guitar parts and there are some really nice guitar solos by Dan aswell. Frank Bello don't really need any further description, he's one of the best bassists of all time, there's no doubt about that. Joey Belladonna is as usual fantastic and I can't understand why I didn't like his singing before...\n\nSo what's my final comments on this masterpiece. Well, it truly is a masterpiece. It might be Anthrax' best or at least it's splitting the 1st place with some of the other albums. Every track is a classic somehow and I recommend \"Madhouse\", \"Medusa\", \"Armed And Dangerous\" and \"A.I.R.\". It's probably the best tracks on here.\n\nSo right now I think you should check out this album if you haven't. Enjoy \"Spreading The Decease\".\n",
        "\nThis is the Anthrax true masterpiece to me. Even if they didn\u2019t miss a shoot \u2018till 1993, this is one of those thrash metal albums you must own if you are a true thrasher. The ironic behaviour (with great lyrics about politics and society) and the sonic violence are the most important characteristics of their sound and here we have the maximum expression of them. Those years were great for thrash and I can only imagine it because I\u2019m too young\u2026\n\nThe title track is truly great with up tempos, great bass drum work and the Belladonna vocals so scratchy in some parts while a bit childish in others. The bass is always pounding, in Overkill style for example. \u201cCaught In A Mosh\u201d is another classic with the funny, moshing refrain. What a song. The melody is always a very, very important characteristic in the music. The natural ability in creating always extremely catchy tracks without losing anything in impact is unbelievable.\n\nCheck out the main riff on \u201cI Am The Law\u201d. Amazing. The tempos are for pure headbanging. The riff on \u201cEfilnikufesin\u201d gets stuck in your head along with the more melodic refrain. Devastating the drum work on \u201cA Skeleton In The Closet\u201d; one of the heaviest tracks here. The riffs are so fast and quite technical too.\n\nThe massive, gloom riff on \u201cOne World\u201d is followed by great thrash assault. Hammering drums and fast riffs. \u201cHorror Of It All\u201d is the main introverted song here, with an obscure beginning followed by some mid tempos. Not the greatest song here in my opinion. Only the beginning of it is remarkable, while the rest is a bit weak. To close this album we have the famous riff of \u201cImitation Of Life\u201d. This song is one of the best ones here. Pure fucking fast thrash with one of the most strange solos I\u2019ve ever heard!\n\nA very good album, in my opinion the best from Anthrax. The first 5 tracks are awesome but some of the following are a bit lower in terms of songwriting and catchiness. Except for the last one obviously. Anyway you can\u2019t go wrong with this if you like thrash.\n",
        "\nAs probably all of you Anthrax fans out there know their singer of this era, Neil Turbin, wasn't too great for them. I find this album great in many ways but there's no doubt on who's the better singer, Neil or Joey Belladonna... It's defenitely Joey. This is a typical 80's Metal album with raw production, great guitar solos & the vocals are very 80's too.\n\nIt seems like many people like this album except for the vocals & well, it's true that these guys would find their singer later in 1984 but if we just focus on this release right now & we'll see what's good with this album....\n\nIt starts with a great opening track called \"Deathrider\", a classic then & still a classic today. It's a great example of how good thrash metal is supposed to be played. Track #2 might be an even bigger classic & it's called \"Metal Thrasin' Mad\". The title has become a description of how thrash metal is, it's simply heavy metal that goes thrashin' mad (fast of course). The first more lacker track is \"I'm 18\", an Alice Cooper cover that isn't any special. The next 2 tracks are classics aswell & is still loved by many Anthrax fans but then the rest is pretty much average due to the fans but not for me. I like every track on this release & I don't really understand why there isn't more fans that like \"Howling Furies\"... I mean, it's a great tune but the production drags it down.\n\nWell, the production is in my opinion both pretty good & really bad. The good things is that you can hear anything but the bad thing is that nothing's stabilized. The raw guitars drowns in a sea of bass & drums & that can really get you on your nervs sometimes. Except for that thing it's pretty good, not expensive but probably the best production of the big fours diverse debut albums.\n\nThe cast performs great, although they would become better... Especially Charlie. Dan Spitz performs some really nice guitar solos while Scott Ian & Dan Lilker is steady as rocks in the background of it all. Neil Turbin is an OK singer but not the right one for Anthrax, I wouldn't say that he drags this album down in the dirt but he didn't really lift it to the stars either. He was OK but it became better with Joey Belladonna as their singer.\n\nI strongly recomend this release for any fan of Metal music. Love it, hate it, I don't care!\n",
        "\nThe first time I heard Anthrax was while I played the game \"GTA: Vice CIty\" which has \"Madhouse\" featured on the radio channel \"VROCK\". It was hard for me to accept Joey Belladonna\u00b4s voice but I took the time to listen to their music over & over again until I finally started to love it all. I like all of their albums from \"Fistful Of Metal\" through \"Persistence Of Time\" & after that one it all started to go downhill.\n\nWith 6 great full lenght albums & 3 EP:s it's pretty hard to pick a couple of pieces from each one of them & put it on a compilaton album, but in this case they've actually made a great job with that. Since this is the only double disc compilation I've found by them it's of course the one I check out first too. I find this compilation very good & they've picked almost exactly my favorite tracks from each album with Joey Belladonna. All of the tracks has also been remastered & they all sound great.\n\nThe things that takes some of the quality from this compilation is the missing of \"Raise Hell\", \"Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind\" & a couple of tracks from \"Fistful Of Metal\". Yeah I know this was released due to the reunion & Joey didn't sing on \"Fistful...\" but it's the only album I like besides the Belladonna-albums. Except for these little notes it's an excellent compilation.\n\nIf you're new to Anthrax' music & want it to be a great start then this is a strongly recomended package that won't make you dissapointed. This is also for you old fans who wants these old classics remastered. A perfect buy for any fan of Anthrax or Thrash Metal...\n",
        "\nAnthrax represents a sort of \u201croad not taken\u201d in the thrash metal genre, as they are considered the least influential of the founding fathers of the genre that made playing faster than one thought possible a staple of greatness. While Slayer was obsessed with evil and aggression, MegaDeth with writing songs too complex to be easily ripped off, and Metallica with wowing the masses with their slick production work; Anthrax elected to stick the closest to the NWOBHM side of the thrash coin and consequently came off as a bit more conservative.\n\nOne of the reasons why so many disown the 80s era of Anthrax is because it doesn\u2019t conform to the stereotypical thrash sound of ugly as hell vocals, overbearing pentatonic shred solos that can not be recalled after hearing (MegaDeth is an exception in this department as well), and cramming 9 or 10 riffs into a song with long ass interludes and instrumental breaks. Charlie Banante can go an hour straight at the double bass pedal with the best of them, but is equally adept at playing a nice simple 4/4 rock beat, and makes that quasi-punk snare sound sing like few others can. Dan Spitz\u2019s solos are well conceived and sing as well as shred; Kirk Hammet could definitely learn a thing or two from his approach.\n\nThe big minus in the eyes of most from the 80s era is Joey Belladonna, who\u2019s voice is more indicative of early power metal vocalists like John Arch and Harry Conklin than the ugly barks of Tom Araya or James Hetfield. Say what you will about Belladonna\u2019s quasi-glam 80s image, the guy sings his ass off and rivals many of the early 80s NWOBHM singers. I challenge Araya or any of the other so-called true thrash vocalists to hit the high note during the chorus of \u201cMedusa\u201d and have it sound remotely as somber and neurotic as it sounds on here. Although I\u2019m a pretty avid fan of Neil Turbin as a singer, as far as Anthrax goes, I\u2019d say Belladonna takes the lead for top vocalist in this outfit.\n\n\u201cSpreading the Disease\u201d is the best representation I\u2019ve heard of the eclectic musical direction that the mid-80s exhibited. You get some pretty solid speed/thrash in the classic album opener \u201cA.I.R\u201d, which is still a favorite amongst fans, as well as the post-apocalyptic politically charged cooker \u201cAftershock\u201d, a song that is as fast and intricate as anything Metallica did during their better days. \u201cThe Enemy\u201d is a solid upper mid-tempo melodic rocker that has a slight Manowar tinge to it. Spitz\u2019s lead work on this one, as well as the crazy ass intro to \u201cStand or Fall\u201d (after the mid-east sounding stuff) are particularly exceptional. The NWOBHM inspired homage to Clint Eastwood \u201cLone Justice\u201d is a nice lyrical change of pace from the politically charged stuff that dominates much of this release.\n\n\u201cArmed and Dangerous\u201d has a beautifully serene acoustic intro, followed by a fast swinging riff fest and mostly listens like something Accept or Judas Priest might have come up with at around the same time. Likewise, \u201cMadhouse\u201d has some strong Iron Maiden influences at play, although it\u2019s a little bit faster than the bulk of their work. \u201cMedusa\u201d gets my pick for the most memorable song on here as well as the best vocal performance out of Belladonna. I defy anyone to listen to this song once and then tell me that they haven\u2019t got that catchy as hell main riff stuck in their head. The album\u2019s closer \u201cGung Ho\u201d was a co-write with Neil Turbin that is a better produced version of what the all speed no compromise sound heard on \u201cFistful of Metal\u201d. That funny as hell ending with the military theme in the lead guitar cracks me up every time. \n\nDespite being released in a year where such amazing releases as Slayer\u2019s \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, Maiden\u2019s \u201cPowerslave\u201d, Dio\u2019s \u201cSacred Heart\u201d and Accept\u2019s \u201cMetal Heart\u201d; I\u2019d argue this is the best album of 1985. It embodies all of the best elements of power, thrash and NWOBHM in one compact 44 minute package. If you want a taste of the real Anthrax, the one before all the extra punk influences, grunge, and then rapped/groove metalcore crap started worming its way into their sound, this is definitely the first one to look for. Most would point to \u201cAmong the Living\u201d as a better thrash release, and from a purely thrash point of view that opinion is correct, but there is more to life than thrash alone, and \u201cSpreading the Disease\u201d has it all.\n",
        "\nIf there's one band's decline that truly saddens me, it would have to be the tragic downfall of Anthrax. Even more so than that of Metallica or even Sepultura, Anthrax plummeted from the heights of thrash near-perfection to the cruelly paired depths of mainstream rock and groove metal. This single, taken from their most recent shitfest, is a perfect display of everything that is wrong with this band right now and as much as it pains me to bash these once-greats, material like this leaves me no other choice.\n\nTrack one is \"Taking the Music Back\" from their We've Come for You All album. I know there's a tendency to associate unpleasant \"metal\" with a Korn/Limp Bizkit/Linkin Park sound without any real grounds other than disappointment, but the best comparison I can think of for this song is Puddle of Mudd. Seriously, John Bush sounds just like the guy and the riffs are limp enough to fit right into their catalog. Nevermind the assertation made in the lyrics, listen to the music: this song was tailored for MTV playability. This is followed by the \"previously unreleased\" mid-paced chugger \"Ghost,\" which while inifinitely less terrible than the first track, is rendered similarly by the annoying recurring siren sound, one of the worst Anthrax solos ever penned (well, at least it has a solo, I guess), and an unnerving Butthole Surfers/Monster Magnet vibe.\n\nBut then comes the promise of cover tracks. To an Anthrax fan, this should bring back warm, fuzzy memories of past covers the band has done. Alice Cooper......S.O.D......the Sex Pistols......wonder what fresh and interesting stuff they'll deliver in the new millennium? Prepare to be monstrously disappointed as the boys kick out the jams with renditions of U2 and the Police. \"Exit,\" the former, is unbearably mellow and uninteresting, while \"Next to You\" is punky but harmless. They might as well have covered Jewel and Blink 182, respectively.\n\nDon't let the allure of video clips entice you into acquiring this little tidbit of Anthrax's shameful modern state. Aside from the only mostly horrid \"Ghost,\" this is sonic excrement, condemned to the deepest, dustiest reaches of bargain bins worldwide. If you're unfortunate enough to welcome it into your home and into your stereo, I promise you'll be quick to welcome it into your garbage can shortly thereafter.\n",
        "\nThis is no doubt (at least in my mind) one of Anthrax's best album. It takes the more serious approach of their prevous album, State of Euphoria, and raises the bar several notches in terms of heaviness and overall songwrting. This also has to be the most lyrically consistent thrash album I've ever heard touching up on things such as hatred, depression, anger, loneliness, and other negative issues without sounding whiny. The tone an atmosphere here is also very dark setting up a very serious album. Joey Belladona also performs at his best here, his voice sounds almost perfect for the mood that this album puts off. Another thing to note is that the songs tend to be much longer, excluding Got the Time.\n\nI really can't pick out any stand out tracks here, because every song on here is executed flawlessly, but if I had to go with highlights, I'd go with Time, Blood, In My World, and Got the Time. Blood and Got the Time have to be the most catchy songs off this album, and I love the chorus fror Blood. I can listen to song about ten times in a row and I can't get sick of it. It's so catchy and memorable, yet so heavy and dark. This is easily the best song on this album. In My World also is quite memorable. It sounds very dark and depressing with lyrics that match the mood as well. Other worthy tracks are Belly of the Beast, H8 Red, and Discharge. All of these songs are memorable and contribute to the album in their own little way. The intro (Intro to Reality) sets up one hell of a thrasher which is Belly of the Beast. Dischrge is the perfect album closer. It's sort of similar to Finale off of their last album, as it is probably the fastest and heaviest track on the album.\n\nThey're really aren't any below spectacular moments on this album, but Keep It in the Family is probably the weakest song on the album, probably because it's a bit overlong, but it's still a great song in it's own right. About the only reason why I did not give this a 100% is because some of the songs are a bit too long, and some songs end up sounding pretty similar to each other. Oh well, small price to pay considering. This and Spreading the Disease are Anthrax's best albums. Yes, this is certainly better than the overrated Among the Living, and is also quite overlooked and underrated. It's ashamed that Anthrax will never make another album like this again, because this is epic and classic thrash. This is an essential for anyone that's a fan of either Anthrax or thrash metal in general. If you do not like this album, then you are truly a poser. nuff said.\n",
        "\nWhat a fun single we've got here! Two intense tracks from 'Spreading The Disease' to be found here, with a well done cover for the punk band 'Sex Pistols'. This comes from the bright era of 'Anthrax', before 'Belladonna' left the band and before Ian began to suck Kinder balls while writing riffs.\n\n'Madhouse' begins with one of the more freaked out introductions I've heard: \"It's time for you medications Mr.Brown/ Moahahahahahah!\". Quite mad doesn't it? Then comes a simple, catchy main riff which continue to flows with background guitar which diving insanely. Nice melodic verses and chorus which flowing pretty well and quite good bridge. Pretty nice song, not neck breaking, but one which can hits the radio for sure. 'A.I.R' is the highlight here. Everything is just wonderful, the fun vocals, the powerful drumming, the dominant bass, the cool guitar leads and the marvelous riffing. It has pretty good structure which progress well, nice moshing and catchy riffage, and awesome verses with fucking groove! The cover is alright, nothing special with covers usually, and so now, but it's a good filler for this single I guess.\n\nOverall, a decent single. Two kicks asses songs and one average cover. Worthy for diehard Anthrax fans!\n",
        "\nPeople love to hit a band while they're down. Sometimes they deserve the onslaught of criticisms, such as in the case of Metallica's infamous failure with St. Anger. Other times the critics are just opposed to change and judge the new style accordingly. This distinction is the reason that an album cannot be judged on bad press alone. One must actually hear the bullshit for themselves before they can be assured that they could not possibly grow to enjoy it. It is precisely for this reason that I obtained Anthrax's Stomp 442, even after immensely disliking their previous album Sound of White Noise. Stakes were high, but I might not hate it at best and I'd only be wasting a few minutes of my life at worst. And you know what, the critics were pretty damn right. This blows hard.\n\nWhoever thinks that Anthrax was still a metal band at this point in their career has lost their ability to distinguish heavy metal from modern hard rock. Whereas Sound of White Noise maintained a pretty heavy grunge vibe, this exudes Foo Fighters and mainstream Soundgarden. There's also an occasional (but noticible) attempt at putting forth a Pantera-esque aggro sound, but it fails completely. This is limp-dicked late 90's radio rock covered in a thin, crunchy, tough-guy exterior and to suggest otherwise is absolutely preposterous.\n\nIt'd be easy to jump on the bandwagon of blaming John Bush as the reason all the albums he's on suck ass, but he's only providing the vocals. Even if he was the worst vocalist/lyricist on the planet, there would have to be a horde of fundamental flaws in the instrumental performances to allow an album to be as piss poor as this album is. Who to blame? Probably Scott Ian. [UPDATE 11/20/07: It has come to my attention that it was actually beloved drummer Charlie Benante who wrote all of the horrendous riffing on this album, not Scott Ian (I had heard a rumor that such was true, but had no proof. Thanks to Durandal1717 for confirming it). So do I owe Scotty an apology? No, because he still agreed to record Charlie's shitty material rather than write his own.] As the only guitarist left in the band, the riffing is all on him. Rather than attempting to write anything remotely thrashy, he sticks to shitty groove riffs (the kind that were exhausted by Pantera and Prong years earlier) and generic chord progressions designed to highlight Bush's vocals, as tough and menacing as they are(n't). Seriously, John Bush sounds about as intimidating on here as Zakk Wylde is on his solo album. But it's made all the worse by a noticible lack of quality riffage and an abundance of shitty guitar effects. His lead work also fails, serving as a fine example of predictable textbook hard rock guitar solos. I can't hear Frank Bello anywhere on here, so I'm going to assume he's just following the guitar and allowing himself to be mixed out, the acceptable norm for bassists of the 90's. Charlie Benante is still pulling his weight, providing as much of a backbone to this garbage as he possibly can, but his efforts are in vain, as all the fantastic double-pedal stomping in the world couldn't make this palatable.\n\nBy the second song on here, you'll have a pretty good idea of how the album is going to sound from beginning to end. \"Random Acts of Senseless Violence\" with its poorly thought out title and \"Fueled\" with its lackluster rehashing of the former's structure. Most of the song on here stick to this format: predictable song formats, embarrasing downtuned riffage, angry (but unintimidating) lyrics and vocals, and a general lack of balls. John Bush provides a saving grace at points, because if you listen closely, you can hear him actually warning the listener of how much this fucking sucks.\n\n\"Two steps forward\none hundred steps back\nwe're going the wrong way.\nIt's backwards, it's backwards\nCuffed and branded\nI can't stand it.\"\n\nHoly shit! John Bush was forced to sing on an atrocious album that he figured would ruin his reputation, so he managed to squeeze this little acknowledgment into \"Riding Shotgun\" to wash his hands of the whole thing. At least that's how I look at it. \"In a Zone\" is the only song on here that is borderline metal, but it's Pantera worship at best. This is followed by more radio-friendly bullshit that the radio never bothered to play. \"Nothing\" is a perfect example of what is wrong with this band. They wanted to appeal to the masses, only to find that the masses are fickle, leaving only old-school fans to disappoint. \"American Pompeii\" is kind of heavy, but reeks of the same mainstreamisms. Then we get some half-groove half-numetal with \"Drop the Ball\" along with another admission of guilt by Bush. Yes, John, you guys dropped the ball with this one. \"Tester\" is another generic number and is entirely forgettable.\n\nBut all of these bullshit songs climax with the last song, \"Bare.\" Hey Anthrax, nice fucking ballad, hypocrites. It picks up near the end with one of those rejected Zakk Wylde-esque groove riffs (with the acoustic and electric guitars doing the same thing), but that isn't really any better. Besides it's the principle of the whole thing that cements this as fecal matter.\n\nFinally, for those of us unfortunate enough to have the rerelease, we get treated to some bonus songs. For a quick summary of the quality of these tracks, replace \"treated to\" with \"assraped by\" and you'll have a fairly appropriate idea of their merit. \"Grunt and Click\" is as dumb as it sounds, another filler that deserved not to make it onto the album (just as many of the songs that did make the album didn't deserve to be there). Then a hideous Celtic Frost cover that the Anthrax of the 90's should have just left alone. Not sure who did the original \"Celebrated Summer,\" but this version is lame, so enough said. And of course, every shitty album cannot end without a Kiss cover. (Okay so Hammerfall's Crimson Thunder is the only other album I know that ends that way, that album sucks too.) \"Watchin' You\" sucks as hard as the original, Anthrax finally doing a song justice for once. Think Blue Oyster Cult had an annoying cowbell sound? Just listen to this track and be convinced otherwise.\n\nI love Fistful of Metal. I love Spreading the Disease. I fucking hate this. I definitely jumped the gun declaring Sound of White Noise as Anthrax's worst album, so I'm not going to do it again until I've listened to the ones that follow this. This is bad, but clearly Anthrax are capable of pushing their boundaries far below what anyone would expect of them. As long as Scott Ian is on his groove-core high, Anthrax is dead. The critics were right. Judge this accordingly.\n",
        "\nThe main problem of this album, is that it isn't consistent. The first half of this album is awesome, there are so many great hits in a row which keeps on very high level. But then it just falls down and gives you the feel like there are too many fucking fillers here.\n\nWe start off with 'Be All, End All'. It begins with a pretty catchy main riff which is played by a silent violin, then the guitars and drums explodes in and the song gets a speed ahead. The main riff repeats itself a bit and then the first verse comes in. The riffing follows the vocals consistently and sounds pretty heavy but still has some melodic sense. The chorus is amazing, 'Belladonna' sings the opener main riff and the lyrics fits perfectly to the riffing. The lead guitar also doing a pretty good job here and this song continues to build up for the whole six minute of it with a bunch of heavy riffs and catchy melodies. Very intense track, and a great opener. 'Out Of Sight Out Of Mind' is another highlight of this album. It opens with a kickass catchy riff and has another melodic yet thrashy chorus. The c-part is also pretty badass and this song flows pretty well with it's great riffing and intensive drumming. 'Make Me Laugh' opens with pretty heavy and moderate riff and then it settled down. The verses sounds a bit weird at the first listening, but they are pretty sweeping and has very well melody and again, another topnotched chorus which steps up this incredible song. The lead guitar sounds a bit rushed, but overall it's fits alright in the middle. 'Antisocial' is a cover for the french band 'Trust'. Pretty punkish rifffing and very flowing verses. The chorus is awesome and very catchy, I thought firstly that Anthrax wrote that song becasue it sounds very natural for them.\n\nNow the B-Side of this album is pretty mediocre, or even boring at some points. Tracks like 'Schism' and 'Misery Loves Company' are alright, sounds okay, but they don't have even a bit of the intensity and catchiness of the first tracks. There is simply nothing which makes you headbang, nothing which punch at your face and gets you into the same mood of the first side. But the worst part here is '13' which is utterly crap, no need to explain, just a mix of farfetched voices and boirng bass riffing.\n\nOverall, you can't ignore the highs of this albums, but you also can't ignore the fillers. Half of this album is just great, pretty catchy and intensive thrash, but there are some tracks which just fall between and don't reach the level of the good ones.\nIf you like thrash, get it even only for the first side of this album. It isn't bad album, it's a mediocre one, but you just can't miss tracks like these mentioned below.\n\nHighlights: 'Be All, End All', 'Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind', 'Make Me Laugh' and 'Antisocial'.\n",
        "\nAnthrax has had a tough time the last few years. Their change from thrash metal to a more straightforward plain metal sound hasn't gone over well with fans of Anthrax. Fans of Anthrax have been divided with Joey supporters and John supporters. It's been a tough time for Anthrax and this long awaited \nalbum needed to come eventually. What we all received was We've Come For You All, an eclectic mix of the newer \n\nAnthrax sound and a more aggressive approach to the music. Where the other John Bush era albums fail, We've Come For You All picks up the slack and gives us the best Bush era album. \n\nThe guitar work has increased in aggressiveness and complexity and rather than focusing solely on heavy riffs, this album takes that sound and adds a bit more complexity and interplay between the guitars. The riffs are still heavy and the slight distortion is still present but there are more leads and solos present on the album as a whole. There are some interesting guitar tones they use on the album (including some that sound relatively industrial) so expect a mix of guitar styles overall. There are some great melodic (sometimes acoustic) passages too - including the intro to \"Any Place But Here\" that give the album something for everyone. None of it is too spectacular in the guitar area but none of it is bad either. A lot of catchy guitar work that I'm sure works very well in a live setting. It helps that Dimebag Darrel (of Pantera fame) contributes a few guitar parts (including some amazing solos) to the record to help them out.\n\nThe bass parts play a kind of ghost role on the album. They disappear and reappear at times. For most of the faster pace songs the bass lines completely meld in with the guitars or drums but at other times it's a main focus point for the song as a whole. \"Black Dahlia\" has a massive bass guitar part on it that, had this been used the entire album, would have made the album soun VERY modern.\n\nThe drum parts on We've Come For You All represent some of the best variety in an album I've heard. There are blast beats (\"Black Dahlia\") to progressive lines (\"Nobody Knows Anything\") and pretty much everything in between. This is a controversial topic because of his massive variety. I found the drums to be one of my favorite parts of the album and are something you can listen to over and over again.\n\nJohn Bush delivers a massive album on his part. His vocals, although not very thrash, do fit very well with the music. Whether you love the man or hate him he presents damn catchy vocal melodies on this album. More sing a long material than anything but it helps when he has help from a lot of vocal layering and some great back up vocals from the band. Some of the distortions on his voice get a tad annoying and I'm still not sure what is being said on the track \"Crash\"...overall I really like the vocals though. \n\nThis album is not for everyone. This is a very modern approach to metal. This is not the Anthrax from 1986 and they haven't been since 1993. Personally this is the best the band has given us since Joey was fired and I'm not going to complain about it. We've Come For You All is one of the best albums Anthrax has done in a long time.\n\nSongs to check out: What Doesn't Die, Superhero, Nobody Knows Anything.\n",
        "\nAs much as I love the carefree wailing of Neil Turbin, it was Anthrax\u2019s decision to fire him and recruit Joey Belladonna that resulted in their best material. Spreading the Disease is one of the finest examples of melodic thrash metal in any book, and just because it\u2019s not as heavy, fast, or as unrelenting as what would follow it (Among the Living, for instance), doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s chump change either.\n\n\u201cA.I.R.\u201d starts this album out fantastically and serves as an archetype for the remaining songs. The riffage is mighty, the drumming is fierce, and Belladonna has got to be heard to be believed. His melodic singing, along with Anthrax\u2019s generally upbeat rhythm guitar, tends to get them written off as less thrash and more power metal, but a quick listen to this song quickly wipes away any such allegations. This album is all riffs all the time, up until the final seconds of the explosive \u201cGung-ho,\u201d which would\u2019ve fit on Among the Living quite nicely. The only breather here is \u201cArmed and Dangerous,\u201d which opens with a fantastic clean passage, with Joey interpreting the vocals as Halford might have done it, before transitioning into a much heavier norm. His finest moment, however, is the soaring lyrics over the mid-paced riffing of \u201cMedusa,\u201d another legendary tune from this album. Overall, not a single song that sucks or is out of place, with quite a few that would be requirements for making a greatest hits album. Sure, some of this is mid-paced and a bit too upbeat for fans of darker thrash metal, but what it lacks in brutality it makes up for in heaps of catchiness and classic riffing.\n\nThe band is also at their best as far as instrumental prowess is concerned. The Ian/Spitz rhythm tagteam produces nary a poor riff, expertly complemented by Charlie Benante\u2019s increasingly powerful drumming. Danny Lilker is a good bass player, but Frank Bello kicks his ass here, interweaving some memorable lines amidst the guitar madness. Guitar solos are nice as well.\n\nHmm\u2026 there\u2019s not much more to say about this one. It\u2019s just a prime example of Anthrax\u2019s powerhouse songwriting and catchy riffery. So get it, it\u2019s great!\n",
        "\nAfter the mightily heavy, though generally unremarkable, Among the Living, Anthrax were in position to push their own boundaries and release something truly impressive. Unfortunately, they released State of Euphoria. Riding the coattails of their previous album, SoE just goes through the motions, doing little to expand the band's established formula and only providing us with a handful of classics.\n\nI can't count how many times I've attempted to listen to this album in its entirety only to be literally thwarted by the unavoidable compulsion to fall asleep. At the time of this review, I've owned this album for over two years, and this is the first time I've heard the whole thing at once. And for the most part, I've been justified in my unintentional napping. This is Among the Living pt. 2. On one hand, that's a good thing, as Charlie Benante's drumming is even more ferocious and Dan Spitz's (or are they Scott Ian's?) guitar solos have improved dramatically. But for the most part, this is pretty generic. The riffage is heavy of course, and at times pretty fucking fast, but nothing is really remarkable. Joey's voice isn't as good as it was, either that or he's not being utilized to his full potential. Lyrics....are lyrics, nothing sticking out in that department either. The overall tone of this album is darker than Among the Living and the songs are a bit longer, but aside from the punky \"Antisocial\" and the stupid filler track \"13,\" this album sounds just like it, though not quite as good.\n\nBut it's still thrash metal, meaning it owns the shit out of their post-Persistence material with John Bush. It's not as fun as Spreading the Disease, but it's good for fans that wish Anthrax was a darker, heavier band.\n\nHighlights: \"Be All, End All,\" \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind,\" \"Finale\"\n",
        "\nThis is when Anthrax picked up the pace, dropped the mediocre-ism and began to develop their own sound (though they seem to have shifted from Priest to Maiden in terms of inspiration this time around). The songwriting is MUCH more memorable and the re-recordings of a few older songs are vastly superior. They have a lot more BITE to them.\n\nThe title track, Armed And Dangerous is one of my all time favorite Anthrax numbers. It starts out subdued with an acoustic intro and soulful vocals, before building up into a fast paced speed metal attack. There is a harmony solo in the middle very reminiscent of Maiden and a very good drum performance from Charlie Benante. Raise Hell brings us back to the mediocre songwriting that was on hand for Fistful of Metal with a very annoying chorus. The verses and riffs both sound good though, so not all is lost. The Sex Pistols cover is okay, nothing great about it, just a song to play for fun. Which brings us to the two re recordings. Metal Thrashing Mad and Panic are both made better, tighter, heavier, beefier and so much more forceful this time around without a sucky vocalist holding them back. Belladonna sings this song the way it SHOULD be sung.\n\nAfter this, Anthrax proved to the world that they were one of the few thrash bands to beat in terms of good, memorable songwriting and letting their inspirations help them to develop their own sound (Spreading the Disease would still have the Maiden influence, but was much harder, thrashier and more aggressive, and they'd move away from it tenfold by the time Among the Living came around).\n",
        "\nYou can tell this was released by Island to make some quick cash, there is just something missing from the recording. It\u2019s flat and at times it feels uninspired, but that\u2019s not to say it not worth picking if you see it for a decent price. Although the recording is bad there are moments were things come together and the band shines through.\n\nThere is a good overall selection of songs from Anthrax\u2019s discography, some things shouldn\u2019t be on here, Bring the Noise for one, which sounds very out of place on the album and the crowd is just not into it at all. In fact one of the more annoying things about the recording is the interaction with the crowd, a good crowd can make or break a live album, this is also a sore point for the Island Years. Joey tries to interact with the crowd is clumsy matter that is an annoyance throughout.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve went over that\u2019s bad, I should point out some good things. First of all, the band is tight, there aren\u2019t any glaring mistakes and the bass is high in the mix, something I enjoy about Anthrax. Joey pulls of a decent performance, and certainly doesn\u2019t ruin any of the songs.\n\nOverall there is nothing that\u2019s make this worth owning, but there\u2019s nothing that makes it a pile of crap, it\u2019s just sort of there.\n",
        "\n'Among The Living' is absolutely the best album from Anthrax. There isn't even one song which is below awesomeness or pure fun, the riffs are top-notched in each song, the lyrics quite interesting, the vocals amazing in their catchiness and overall this album is very enjoyable and you can listen to it a lot times and still like it each time.\n\nThe opener track begins with an epic riff which repeats himself in different variations with 3 guitars till it reach the main riff and then the drums becomes much more sharp and the first verse begins. \"Disease! Disease! Spreading The Disease!\" this is such a mooshing part that your neck is gonna break off and your eyes will fly away from their holes. The verses are amazingly catchy and so is the chorus which is a great example for a Thrash hymn. Seriously, this is such a killer song that no one can stand of and it's really enjoyable one that you'll dig off for a long time once you are into it. \"Caught In A Mosh\" is one of Anthrax most well known hits. It's fast, intense, catchy and has very varied vocals. There are the rapid singing in the verses, the shouting back vocals in the bridge and the softer in the chorus. It keeps on interest for each second and it has a blowing mind riffs and it's an unparalleled hit. \"I Am The Law\" has an overwhelming guitar riffs and a lot of groove and it's a bit slower track then the former tracks. The chorus is a bit aggressive in it's lyrics and vocals and there is a fast headbanging section which begins in 3:30. It's a blazing track and awesome as all the tracks in this album.\n\"Indians\" is the most epic song here and very memorable one. It begins in mid tempo drumming and then dual guitar riffing and when it's all balanced together (in 0:21) it's sounds just perfect! The verses has a load of killer riffs and the chorus is amazing one with the best vocals ever of Joey Belladonna which sounds perfect here.\n\nThe only reason why I didn't gave this album 100 [and this album is really close to it!] is because there aren't enough leading guitar here, and there are some which sounds pretty mediocre for such flawless songs. If it had an exciting solos or something which gets a bit close I could give it 100 without hesitate.\n\nIn conclusion: this is a very enjoyable album without even a single weak or average track. This is definitely one of the best and the most memorable Thrash albums of all time and if you call yourself a metalhead, then you MUST buy this flawless classic. Easily one of the best albums ever and Anthrax at their highest peak.\n",
        "\nWith the end of the reunion recently (and the controversy that seems to be following it) I revisited this collection of re-recorded classics with John Bush on the vocals. I realized how much I enjoy John Bush\u2019s chemistry with Anthrax. The Greater of Two Evils is literally (at least in my opinion) the best of both worlds for Anthrax.\n\nThe Greater of Two Evils consists of classic tracks (as chosen by fans on Anthrax\u2019s website) from the pre-Bush era. They then took this list of songs and went into the studio to re-record these songs with the at-the-time current singer, John Bush. No new original material is present on the album, just a very original and fun vibe (that Anthrax usually has live.)\n\nMusically, the album is only made up with tracks from the \u201cthrash era\u201d of Anthrax. Thusly, you are going to be listening to heightened speed and heaviness. In fact, with the updated production, it\u2019s almost heavier than the previous recordings of the songs. The guitar tones are definitely cleaned up (20 some odd years of touring will do that to a song) and the bass and drums finally are relevant as compared to some earlier versions of the songs. The songs are tight and well performed with a few differences in them timing wise. If you are a fan of the original versions, these are going to sound overproduced. I know that\u2019s what I thought when I first heard this collection. I missed the \u201craw\u201d sound of some of the older tracks and the lack of characteristic pops and scratches also brought a tear to my eye. \n\nSo how does John Bush fit in with the \u201cold\u201d material? Quite well, surprisingly. He has a voice that fits the music very well. I was cautious coming into the collection \u2013 John Bush era music was groove oriented and rather \u201cgrunge\u201d inspired metal. He does a fine job (I wouldn\u2019t say he was better than Belladonna) but he doesn\u2019t slaughter the material in any means. There are even a couple of songs from the Turbin era (one album really). In fact, there are a couple songs that sound even better with Bush singing. One of those tracks includes the opening track, Deathrider. Granted, that\u2019s a matter of opinion not so much fact.\n\nIn essence, this album isn\u2019t for old school Anthrax fans. If you truly love the old recordings then this isn\u2019t a great buy for you \u2013 unless you want a way to start to get into the Bush era material \u2013 for which this is the perfect album to which do so. I personally, loved this collection. It\u2019s really for fans of the entire Anthrax discography though. So keep that in mind.\n\nSongs to check out: Deathrider, Belly of the Beast, I Am the Law.\n",
        "\nThe first time I heard Anthrax it was with their 3rd full length album \"Among The Living\" and in my opinion is the second best thrash metal album ever written. I really got into Anthrax and decided to find all their stuff, and there isn't a better way to get to know a band than by starting with their first album, right?\n\nAt first, I noticed the different vocals. It's Neil Turbin who sings here, and although Belladonna was the best Anthrax vocalist, Turbin may be the second. He actually screams the lyrics instead of singing them and it really fits the songs well. \"Fistful Of Metal\" is maybe the most aggressive and the dirtiest album by Anthrax. The lyrics usually have to do with violence, death, driving fast and other pretty cool stuff.\n\nThe music itself has fast guitar riffs and really cool solos. \"Deathrider\" has such a kick ass main riff that will really get you into a headbanging mood 'til your neck breaks, and with insane high pitched screams and a catchy chorus, this is definitely the best song here and one of Anthrax's greatest hits. \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" is a totally amazing classic with a simple and great guitar riff and outstanding bass line during the solo. The Alice Cooper cover is much better than the original version, but it isn't of the level of the original songs here because it's maybe a little bit slower and less interesting. Another outstanding song is the closing track \"Howling Furies\". Here Turbin really sings calmly and doesn't scream. The riffs are just wonderful, the second solo is the best one in the whole album, and it's just an amazing way to close such a great album.\n\nThis album is, without a doubt, one of the best albums in the 80's thrash scene. Each song here is good in its own way and you won't get bored of this album easily. I have heard it so many times that I can't remember exactly how many times I've enjoyed this goddamn album.\n\nHighly recommended for all the \"metal thrashing mads\" out there.\n",
        "\nLooking for a high quality, full-speed, brute force slice of An-thrash? Well look no further, because Among the Living will satisfy your every need. The album is not without faults, but it does more than enough in the \"Right\" department to make up for them. \n\nThis is easily Anthrax's heaviest and most intense album to date. The band has never thrashed harder than on here, and actually, few other bands have either. Among the Living is all about particularly crushing thrash metal. The Spitz/Ian riff tagteam doesn't fail to deliver, with a shitload of memorable riffs of varying degrees of speed and awesomeness throughout the album, but it's the drums that send this into hyperdrive. Charlie Benante is always insane, but on here, he's otherworldly. His drumming style, as mentioned in some of the other reviews, might take a bit of getting used to (he likes to do snare/bass double time beats as opposed to always using bass/snare ones), but it's that uniqueness that adds charm to his performance. Add Frank Bello's interesting bass lines and the soaring vocal delivery of Joey Belladonna and you've got yourself one hell of an instrumental powerhouse. The lyrics are quite well done also, touching on everything from the Cold War, to Native Americans, to Judge Dredd. And did I mention there's plenty of nice guitar solos? \n\nOn paper, this album rules without question. Unfortunately, some problems arise in the songwriting. Though there's plenty of Anthrax's catchy riff progressions and plenty of catchy Belladonna lines, somehow much of this tends not to stick with the listener. The only memorable lines I can usually recall are limited to choruses, namely the classic chorus of \"Caught in a Mosh.\" Maybe my memory is failing me, but most of the riffs and lyrics on this are lost to me as soon as the album is over. I don't have this problem with Fistful of Metal or Spreading the Disease, where every song is just as killer as the previous one. Somehow Among the Living comes off as unremarkable, even though it absolutely rules while it's playing. The other problem I've found with this is similarities in riffing. That first riff from \"I am the Law\" is too damn similar to the first riff of Slayer's \"Tormentor\" and that detracts from the song every time I hear it. That main riff from \"Indians\" sounds a lot like Rush's \"A Passage to Bangkok\" too. I'm sure there's more, I just haven't found them yet. But hearing riffs like that just remind me that I could be listening to the other songs rather than these ones that sound ripped off. \n\nEven though there's some shit in here that bugs me personally, I still must recommend it to fans of thrash metal for the sheer intensity of the music and quality of muscianship. The lack of memorability that I've noticed might be just me.\n",
        "\nThis release is by no means essential, however I got it with Fistful of Metal for pretty cheap so it was sort of a bonus. The EP contains two studio tracks, two live tracks, a cover and Anthrax's first single. \n\nThe music is a mixed bag. On one hand you have the awesome song 'Armed and Dangerous, which starts off like an acoustic ballad before erupting into some damn nice speed metal. The two live tracks are excellent, with Joey Belladonna pulling off the vocals flawlessly. Then on the other hand you have the throwaway tracks, which consist of 'Raise Hell', and 'God Save the Queen'. 'Raise Hell' is a boring repetitive track which fails to keep me interested enough to listen to the whole song, while 'God Save the Queen' features badly done vocals and sounds half assed.\n\nThe last two tracks are pretty much the same as their later versions on 'Fistful of Metal', except with a greater NWOBHM influence and less speed. They're alright tracks I suppose, but the versions of them on 'Fistful of Metal' kill them.\n\nIn conclusion, this EP is somewhat of a mixed bag. There is virtually no reason to get it unless you're a collector, but alongside 'Fistful of Metal' it's a good deal. Although it would've had it's value in 1985, nowadays it is just an average EP which fails to stick out of the crowd in any way or have much historical importance.\n",
        "\nI really shouldn't like Anthrax, they consist of pretty much every element of music I hate. On this album they use these elements more than usual, and I almost think this is their best effort. There are heaps of elements that usually relate to \"fun\" music, which I generally see as lame and irritating. The vocals are high, I mean extremely high, the guitar tone isn't overly fierce, the lyrics are often about 'being metal' and other stupid shit, The cover is stupidly over the top, and finally, you have the look that they sported, not just long hair, they were full out glam frizzy hair, but still this album just kicks so much ass.\n\nHowever, this album is fun, not stupid power metal shit that most people pass off as fun, this is actually fun to listen to. The tones of the band are not overly aggressive, but the riffs are fast and are generally as good thrash riffs as you can find. Despite being fast, their are so many headbangable grooves through here you can't help but get sucked into this.\n\nMost of the songs are in the fast to very fast range, with the exception of the Alice Cooper cover, in fact, this is probably the fastest of the big four debuts. Helping this speedy approach to metal is the quality production this album has. Note that I have the re-release with the Armed and Dangerous EP, and it seems as if the production has been massively improved since it's original release. Anyway, people looking to buy this at this stage probably aren't going to find it on vinyl. Back to the production... It's clear and allows the fast guitarwork and drumming to sound fantastic and easily discernible from each other. Also the crisp sounding guitars avoids 'muddiness' which could easily cause the riffs to run together and loose some of that groove.\n\nThis album also has a surprisingly strong drum sound, which is extremely rare for thrash albums, with an almost modern level of dominance. This leads to the music having that irresistible groove due to the catchy drumwork. Not overly polished, or difficult, but damn it emphasises the sheer amounts groove on this album.\n\nIt's this simultaneous mix of groove and thrash metal (Which doesn't happen much, most bands generally just do one or the other. And yes, I know groove metal wasn\u2019t around yet) which actually makes the high pitched vocals of Neil Turbin actually seem like they fit. He actually does come across as fun and enjoyable. Turbin is about as enjoyable as Belladonna. Both have their advantages and drawbacks. Turbin has a little bit of a rougher sound on his lower vocals, which I enjoy as it makes the sound a little harsher, and avoids making the album becoming too fun and cheesy, maintaining the album's serious respectability. However, He has an awful high squeal, he just vibratos the note like 7 times a second and it kind of sounds like high pitched controlled gargling.\n\nThis really hurts other wise solid, catchy fun songs such as \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" and \"Panic\", as they have too much emphasis on these notes that are executed so poorly.\n\nThe song writing on the album isn't overly amazing, most songs have a verse which flies along at insane speeds, before going into a chorus which generally involves one guitar playing heavier chords in a simple, but effective manner, while the other continues the lower fast as hell rhythm. Then there's generally a solo after that and another chorus. There you go, you have how all the songs are written, luckily the riffing and rhythm sections flow along with enough originality and catchiness make this not a problem.\n\nThe songs have one last element which makes them stand out. The Soloing. This is sheer catchy, musical soloing at it's finest, they're very fast and don't really deviate from the tempo of the song, allowing the solos to fit into the songs perfectly, again, making the album more concise and enjoyable, but restricting the number of major tempo changes.\n\nAs for best songs, I'd have to say the opener \"Deathrider\" is the best song on here for the \"High pitched haters\" like my self, as there are really no notes out of place, and it's verse riff is probably the most fun riff ever written, \"Howling Furies\" has pretty much the same riff, and also a little bit more variation to the old layout. \n\nThere aren't any bad songs as such to be found, \"Panic\" has some annoying vocals, and the cover of Alice Cooper\u2019s \"I'm Eighteen\" is average, but even then, those aren\u2019t bad songs, only average ones.\n\nIn conclusion, every thrash fan should have this, and even if you're not a thrash fan this album deserves to be in your collection, if only for something to throw on every now and then for some actually fun music.\n",
        "\nOh man, this album just gets me up in arms. Sure it's not the most refined thrash album, nor is it the most technical, but by God, it may just be one of the most fun, enjoyable listening experiences in the entire genre. One can't help but headbang to every single glorious moment of it.\n\nLooking at the cover image, you know this album is going to rule. Yeah, I've said it before, and I'll probably say it again. But the image of some guy getting his face destroyed by a chainmail-clad fist just screams heavy fucking metal to me. I first discovered Anthrax during the John Bush era and almost completely disregarded them as utter crap. Thankfully, I stumbled upon this prime example of classic thrash metal and was forever converted to the Anthrax fanbase.\n\nI actually prefer this to all the other Big Four debut albums. Not to slight any of them, but their debuts cannot top this. I think it's due in part to the magnificently over the top vocal performance of Neil Turbin. Holy shit, that guy can wail like no one else.His first line on \"Soldiers of Metal\" is downright amazing. Very reminiscent of Manowar's own Eric Adams. I can only imagine Neil's solo stuff to be equally impressive. The lyrics he delivers aren't bad either, even if they don't stray from early thrash's typical subject matter.\n\nThe guitarwork here is phenomenal. Maybe it's the killer quality of the riffing throughout or the solid production, but the guitarwork sounds amazing. The lead guitar work is quite impressive as well, accentuating the rhythm guitar parts it happens to appear over. Lots of memorable solo/riff combinations here, namely the intros to \"Death from Above\" and \"Anthrax.\" Legendary heavy metal, my friends.\n\nCharlie Benante's drumming is clearly heads and tails over just about everybody else at the time of this album's release. His intricate playing coupled with Danny Lilker's sweet bass work make for a rock solid rhythm section.\n\nIf you're any kind of metal fan, you should be able to appreciate the glorious thrash metal presented here. The only song I don't really care for is the instrumental \"Across the River,\" mainly because I enjoy Neil's vocal work so much. I might even argue this as Anthrax's best album simply because of Turbin's presence. A good vocalist can make all the difference sometimes. But anyway, this is a solid, powerful, creative, and yes, a glorious thrash metal masterpiece that should garner far more respect and admiration than it generally does. Highly recommended.\n",
        "\nThis is the first Anthrax album I'd ever listened to, and it would have been the last if I hadn't been informed that their older material was purist thrash metal. Basically, this album delayed my love of Anthrax's old albums by like two years and for that I can never forgive it. It sucks ass and should be avoided. \n\nThe first song is \"Potter's Field.\" Before you even get to hear new singer John Bush, you get a solid minute of static for an intro, and then a cool riff. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the only cool riff on the entire album. Most of the riffs are midpaced and generic, as are most of the leads. Worse still is the guitar sound. Shitty production combined with a grungy ass tone makes for fucking bad guitar sound. All this is evident before you even hear Bush sing. Bush himself isn't a bad singer necessarily, but his style of singing only reinforces the impression that this is album is just heavy grunge. He sounds quite reminiscent of the guy from Stone Temple Pilots, if that helps cast some light on his voice. \n\nGrungy vocals, grungy lyrics, grungy riffs, grungy guitar tone....the album is pretty much grunge. The only thing that keeps this remotely metal is the powerful (but poorly mixed) drumming and the occasional too heavy for grunge riffs. Seriously, this is basically STP Vol. 4 if it was heavier and had only one ballad. Alice in Chains kicks the shit out of this nonsense. \n\nOther demerits are deserved for the stupid song title of \"Sodium Pentathol,\" spelled out in its chemical formula. Okay, you guys looked up a little chemistry. Here's a gold star, but nobody gives a shit. \n\nThis might be the worst thing Anthrax has ever done, but I haven't listened to the other John Bush albums to compare. It's hard to believe this is the same band that recorded Fistful of Metal. This album makes Load and Reload look like Ride the Lightning. Shitty sell-out grunge metal. If you really like grunge, fine, you'll love this, but don't dare confuse this with real metal, it's not even close.\n",
        "\nAs the majority of the main american Thrash acts slipped into the different style of 90's Thrashing, so did Anthrax, beginning with 1993's \"Sound of White Noise.\" Stomp 442 isn't at all a bad album, it's just not up to par with their original material, as is usually the case. \n\nCharlie's drumming didn't particularly blow me away on this one. It wasn't bad, pretty solid, but it was just a bunch of modern-rockish beats that any one of a million drummers could have done just as well. \n\nLet's do the riffs and songs all in one swoop. As was to be expected, 'thrax ditched their fast-picking again and went deeper into the slowly, more groove-based, mainstream rifing of the 'Sound of...' record. That being said, the songs themselves were obviously geared more toward a 90's radio audience, with almost all of them coming in at a convenient 3:30-4:00 minutes. \n\nThere's not too much to say about this one. It's what you would expect from a 90's Thrasher. All in all, it's not bad, just kinda predictable and bland and makes you kinda wish they had stuck to their style. It's still a fun, mindless listen now and then, though\n",
        "\nThere's no doubt that this release is not among the finest to come from Anthrax, and it is good to see reviewers viewing it in it's historical context. But I, for one, do enjoy it and see it as a decent warm-up for Joey Belladonna, and a slight shift in sound for Anthrax. FISTFUL OF METAL, their first album, was a very straight-forward aggressive metal/bordering on thrash release with few frills and a lack of technical wizardry. But clearly the band's skills were improving and a desire to write more complex and skill-dependent material clearly arose. Not to mention the more acrobatic vocal style that Belladonna brings to the picture. The title cut packs some glorious riffing into it's chorus, and the intro is a pretty damn memorable piece of writing. \"Raise Hell\" on the other hand, is overall a waste of time. When Anthrax write filler material, MAN do they write filler! Now the cover of the Sex Pistols \"God Save The Queen\" is decent, but as Belldonna has NO believable vocal snottiness, their version lacks the bile of the original. However both new versions of \"Panic\" and \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" are slightly improved from the debut album. Not because of the vocals mind you, but because the band perform them with greater tightness and authority. So yeah, not an amazing release, and not one of this band's premiere moments, but still not bad or even average all the same.\n",
        "\nI think this record had an important purpose in 1985. Thrash metal was on the rise and Anthrax was about to release their 2nd LP. However, they'd changed singers, and this can be a mortal blow for many bands. How do they entice new fans while calming the fears of old fans? By releasing a moderately priced EP with a couple songs destined for the new LP, plus re-recorded versions of older songs with the new singer. Good thinking. This record starts off with \"Armed & Dangerous\", one of Anthrax's best tunes. From the acoustic intro to the raging body of the song, this one is a total classic. Next comes \"Raise Hell\", which was going to be on \"Spreading The Disease\" but ultimately wasn't. Its not really a great song, but not horrible, either. Anthrax's cover of \"God Save The Queen\" is pretty awful. Joey really doesn't have the voice for it. Follow that up with a couple of \"live\" performances of old songs with the new singer. Joey proves he can handle it (and really, his isn't so drastically different from Neil Turbin's that he would completely alter the vibe of the songs).\n\nFast forward a few years and one can see that this record has outlived its usefulness. The best song on here is available on another album. The Belladonna-fronted line up got so popular that many newer fans by-passed the Turbin-era entirely, so fewer people are curious to see how Joey might handle the Neil Turbin songs. The 2 tracks exclusive to this disc are mediocre at best. The only other thing a record label can do to entice buyers is tack on the band's first (and very rare) single so that diehards who have everything else have something new to buy, since that single is not available anywhere else. Thus, if you are a completeist or diehard fan of either the Belladonna or Turbin-eras, you might want to look into this one. Casual fans probably won't be impressed.\n",
        "\nMan, Anthrax is one hell of a fun and heavy rock band. On this album Scott Ian really comes into his own as an immaculate writer and performer of brain-meltingly awesome riffs. I mean, sure you have your Exodus and Testament and Overkill and whatever but whenever I listen to them I'm all like \"argh\" and then \"zzz\", because unlike Anthrax those bands piss me off with their incredible stupidity and dorkiness. Yeah sure, the 'Thrax can be pretty stupid too but at least they don't take themselves that seriously as \"thrashers\", preferring instead to write fun, catchy songs instead of trying to construct the longest sequence of boring chugga-chugga riffage this side of... well, another generic thrash-for-thrashers band I guess.\n\nWow, got off to a ranting start there sorta. Well anyway Among The Living is a pretty damn great marriage between ridiculously gleeful guitar brutality and fun hardcore-style SHOUTING CHORUSES!!!. There are nine songs here and they are all amusing in some way. For example, you might think there's not much entertainment to be had in overlong clunker Horror of it All, but even that song, the crappiest on here, has a cool breakneck-style blitzkrieg ending. And the lyrics on here are pretty satisfying, at least by metal standards; they are self-conscious and silly yet somehow manage to avoid total obnoxiousness.\n\nJoey Belladonna is a cool vocalist, too. Sure, he sounds rather wimpy without his pals backing him up with hardcore SHOUTING!!!, but when it all comes together, the grinding riffage, the back-up vocals and Joey's kiddy singing, like on the choruses, the effect is positively anthemic. And starting from this album on to Persistence of Time, Scott Ian get the perfect guitar tone. It's loud and suffocating and tight as hell. And it never feels out of place, unlike say \"hey we're fucking Symphony X and WE KICK ASS!!!\". Too bad lead gitaroo man Dan Spitz sounds like he's high, what's with those grating psychedelic solos of his...\n\nBut really, the main reason why I like this so much and prefer it to less-mainstream thrashers is that it feels so classy. It's like, the ultimate tribute to skateboarding and comic books, it's not just thrash for thrash's sake. And as such, you should be able to enjoy it even if you ain't so hot on metal as a whole.\n",
        "\nI had read a short article on Anthrax prior to Fistful of Metal\u2019s release that described the band\u2019s sound as akin to sticking a Black & Decker in your ear. For many fans at the time, the initial din heard by the band erupted from its debut, more than likely the airborne ruthlessness of \u201cDeathrider\u201d. Now, Black & Decker manufactures lots of items, highly noted for its array of power tools, and with \u201cDeathrider\u201d it\u2019s easy for pictures of radial arm saws and lawnmowers to flood the mind, but for the more melodic and even bashful \u201cSoldiers of Metal\u201d and \u201cHowling Furies\u201d, I\u2019d have to go with maybe a can opener or an electric tea kettle. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that these are bad songs, just not their best pieces. Both tracks use some of the most conventional main rhythms to grace wax, revamped to some degree and variation by many before them (even at the tale end of \u201983). High points are the brisk energy of \u201cSoldiers of Metal\u201d that coalesces into a thudding cessation and the solo in \u201cHowling Furies\u201d, a song with an ending that won\u2019t rumble with double bass until its placement as finale on Fistful of Metal. In addition, the gravity garnered by Turpin\u2019s fervent shrills is a premonition to their future efforts that is already announced on the disc's back cover. \n\nThe production on this and Fistful of Metal have their problems, of course. The malnourished mix value on the full-lengther is fairly renown, while the 7\u201d\u2019s via Ross the Boss is a tad louder and top-heavy, but still basement level. \n\nIn addition to being the band\u2019s first label-backed effort, Soldiers of Metal is also the first 7\u201d pressed by Megaforce Records. But the bright side was that 7\u201d records were only a few bucks and though Anthrax wouldn\u2019t really show anyone not privy to their demos what they\u2019re made of until \u201cDeathrider\u201d, \u201cMetal Thrashing Mad\u201d and \u2018Panic\u201d, it\u2019s still halfway decent for the time. Plus now it\u2019s a fair collector\u2019s item.\n",
        "\nWhat can you say about Anthrax that hasn\u2019t been already said? These guys reunited the 1985 line-up a number of months ago and took part in the closing dates of Gigantour this summer with Megadeth. The Belladonna era has been the most popular of the line-ups among the fans, it\u2019s the band that they could relate with and grew up with. Now they are back and are gaining new fans and exciting their existing fan base. Anthrax has had it\u2019s fair share of best of collections, like with many bands there were always tracks that were bumped because of time constraints. Not the case with Anthrology, with two discs, there is room to please. Each disc includes 15 tracks a piece, disc one starts with Spreading the Disease to the I\u2019m the Man E.P., disc two picks up with State of Euphoria to Killer B\u2019s. There\u2019s no exclusive new material to Anthrology, there is however, a French version of Antisocial, which can be found as an import single. None the less, it\u2019s a great introduction to the kids that caught them on tour this summer and the old fans that haven\u2019t replaced the cassettes with cd\u2019s. Island Records have done a wonderful job with the packaging and gave the band input into this collection, it wasn\u2019t a mad dash for your cash, they took their time. Dust off the Bermuda shorts and the Looney toones t-shirts, the boys are back in town.\n\nRuben Mosqueda\n",
        "\nYou could look at this album in two ways. It could be seen as the first step towards Anthrax abandoning their 1990s output and reverting back to what they did best when Joey Belladonna was around in the glory years: write great songs. After Belladonna left at the end Comparisons to the Belladonna years are inevitable and the band\u2019s most critically acclaimed albums, \u201cAmong the Living\u201d and \u201cSpreading the Disease\u201d, when Belladonna found his feet as a vocalist, contribute more than half the tracks.\n\nThis release is the best thing the band could have ever done. It\u2019s a greatest hits record for those of us who\u2019ve worn out the grooves of Among the Living and Spreading the Disease. \n\nThe songs were chosen by a poll of which classic tracks fans would like to hear covered by a John Bush fronted Anthrax and the best Anthrax songs are naturally here. It provides new interpretations of the Anthrax metal classics we love so much; it\u2019s really a covers album featuring members of Anthrax. Highlights include \u201cMetal Thrashing Mad\u201d, where Bush\u2019s voice sounds most at home and \u201cEfilniklufesin (N.F.L.)\u201d where Benate actually improves on the drumming of the original recording adding to the intensity Bush brings to the track. \n\nOn the other hand, \u201cThe Greater of Two Evils\u201d feels a bit like Belladonna\u2019s last album, 1991\u2019s overblown \u201cAttack of the Killer B\u201d. That album, complete with re-recordings of \u201cI\u2019m the Man\u201d (1987) and a version of Public Enemy\u2019s \u201cBring the Noise\u201d ended the creative vitality of Anthrax. They have not put out an album of original material to stand beside \u201cAmong the Living\u201d or even the lesser \u201cState of Eurphoria\u201d. But, \u201cThe Greater of Two Evils\u201d is a worthy release and is very much worth your time, if only to hear Bush and band rip through what must certainly rate in the upper echelons of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nAnthrax certainly made an interesting step after the alarmingly brilliant \"Sound of White Noise\" release. This compact hardcore-meets-Anthrax mix certainly entertains but is lacking in much of the brilliance the predating album possessed. The production is about the same, (despite the bands protests to the opposite) the performances are also in line with the previous - the only weak link is the songwriting. Be it the label politics distracting them, or the unsure nature of a new line-up...the band dropped the ball in coming with a consistantly brilliant album in the same vibe of \"Sound of White Noise\". \n\nDespite this drop in overall quality, the album still manages a few fun driving tunes that any fan of Bush-era Anthrax will want to own. The opening grind of \"Random Acts of Senseless Violence\" and the ultra-catchy \"Nothing\" stand out as great middle-of-the-road of modern metal tunes. \"Riding Shotgun\" and \"Fueled\" also have some classy Pantera-wannable riff-hooks as well. The rest goes from good to pointless, the band can claim they've stepped up lyrically but it matters little when the songs are only half-baked all around.\n\nAnthrax burrow on with some great moments and some poor. Sadly, the band never recaptured the brilliance of \"Sound of White Noise\" and this record seems to function as the \"lost child\" of the Anthrax catalog.\n",
        "\nWith Among The Living, Anthrax moved from the more or less traditional heavy metal influenced sound of their first two records to their trademark style of thrash metal, with lots of one note mosh riffs, thrash breaks and humorous lyrics. Eventually, this slight change probably also led to the rap thing couple of records later. This is a full-out thrash record, though. And a good one too.\n\nThe LP has a great overall feel to it. While being really thrashy and aggressive in a way, it also stays melodic and really fun to listen to. The production is very satisfying, although rhythm guitar gets a bit drowned in the mix at certain times. Otherwise, the guitar tone is nice and heavy. The palm muted riffs sound great and the tone for the solos is outstanding. Bass is very audible as it also should be, since Frank Bello is a great bassist and he doesn't dissapoint here. His lines diverse and well played.\n\nI really wonder why Dan Spitz and Scott Ian aren't a bit more appreciated in metal circles, because they mastered their instruments extremely well over the years. And their performance on Among The Living is one of the best if not the best in their career. Ian's playing is the tightest EVER. He plays every single triplet or palm muted riff on this one perfectly, like he is some kind of a machine. Dan's solos and leads are again great. He still has that middle-eastern feel to his playing which actually works out really fine. Some of the best solos in thrash metal are his, and most of them are on this record.\n\nThe riff work here is good, the main thing about it is that the riffs are really memorable and great to headbang to. There are also some great thrash breaks and sudden tempo changes on here. Not to mention some awkard time marks which end up being really good for the overall song feel. You probably all know Joey Belladonna. He doesn't dissapoint here, no way. His specific voice suits great in the 'Thrax music. He isn't as menacing as let's say Blitz or Ballof, but he can still sound thrashy. He's also one of those thrash singers who can sing some high pitched vocals. There aren't much true high screams on here and he's no Russ Anderson, but it's all OK. Charlie handles the drums nicely, he plays some nice fills and his rhythms throughout the songs are diverse and well played.\n\nThe lyrics are one of the best thing of the release and a high water mark for all other thrash metal bands. I don't know who came up with this, but it's intellegent, funny and right to the point. |Wake up dead in a plywood bed/talking to you is clapping with one hand/stomp, stomp, stomp the idiot convention| are just few of those great verses.\n\nThere aren't any real downers on Among The Living, but there certainly are some great classics. Everybody knows ''Indians'' with that great epic feel to it, ''Caught In A Mosh'' which is actually not about the metal mosh but about mosh in the classic meaning of the word. N.F.L. is funny as hell, and I Am The Law is the crazy riff monster.\n\nHell, I think I made my point. Get it! (the point and the record ;))\n",
        "\n(note: this is a resubmission. My old review was worked up to this album being a 5 star classic, but after a few recent listens, I realized it really isnt)\n\nI dont mean to be an ass, but this really isnt a great album. It has a few songs that are absoloutley great, and when they are good, they are smoking! But there is a lot of filler on this. Examples are Soldiers of Metal, Death From Above and Across the River. I'm also not keen on Deathrider, but its still an alright song to listen to. \n\nBut man oh man, the rest of the album is collosal. Metal Thrashing Mad, Panic, Subjugator, Anthrax, Howling Furies. All of these mentioned songs are absoloutley great. Anthrax has a heavy intro which shortly speeds up and Panic has a very nice Maiden worship \"speed harmony\" in the middle which makes the song all the more better. Subjugator is a personal favorite of mine, due to its different shades and colors. Its filled to the brim with solos and riffs, and the vocals are also great. It's probably my personal favorite on the album. Death From Above tries to be this song, but fails horribly because of its repetitive and annoying chorus. \n\nI guess there are a few things that make this album less than it could be. First off is the annoying vocals of singer Neil Turbin. No doubt, the guy can wail, he can shout, and he has lots of conviction behind his voice, but I find it annoying, over the top, and clownlike. Now hearing this from a guy who enjoys Joey Belladonna, Bobby Blitz and Rob Halford, obviously cant be a good thing.\n\nAnother thing is the sub par production. The guitars are very low in the mix, and the bass and drums overpower it. I think they perfected this sound on the Spreading the Disease album, where they struck a balance of all the instruments without them overshadowing one another. The songwriting could also be better. It doesnt have a shortage of good riffs, but the songs themselves are hardly memorable, with the exception of the ones I praised above. Of course, they were pretty much a Judas Priest clone in these days, but even Slayer did the NWOBHM type sound better, while maintaining originality. \n\nLuckily, Anthrax sacked neil Turbin after this album and the production quality went up a few notches after this one. This is not a horrible album, just nothing outstanding or noteworthy. Still, for die hard Anthrax albums, its something worth hearing, because even if the listening experience isnt good, seeing the progress from this album to Among the Living will be.\n",
        "\nThis is one of those albums I own that stands out in my collection--as nothing else I own sounds quite like it or makes me feel in a similar way to the way this makes me feel.... and that feeling... is called \"happy.\"\n\nIn Anthrax's usual way, the music is rather peppy and upbeat--though probably more so than usual. Now, I usually despise really happy crap, but the music itself isn't what's so happy--it's the idea that I've used the CD as a mood lightener from time to time, now about that music...\n\nThere are two extremely short tracks written, apparently for fun that I actually enjoy. \"604\" and \"Cupajoe\"--the former being written about a fat girl the band viewed in a tabloid who weighed 604 pounds, the latter about Anthrax's apparent addiction to coffee. Both of these tracks make up for their awkward shortness with about the heaviest riffing on the album.\n\nMy personal favorites are (yeah, in this order) Catharsis, Inside Out, Crush, Toast to the Extras, Born Again Idiot, and the secret track, Pieces, that starts at the 8-minute mark after Stealing From A Thief. Toast to the Extras opens with acoustic guitar, then dives headlong ... into... a mild melodic track that is strangely compelling. Pieces is entirely acoustic and (I believe) sung by bassist Frank Bello, as the song is about his brother who was murdered in New York. Yes, people apparently get killed there. Dimebag Darrel and Vinnie Paul make a guest appearance on the album, and that appearance is in Inside Out, which varies wildly from softly played guitar verses to rampaging, thrashy choruses. Catharsis, I guess I like, most of all because of the lyrics which include the line \"Angels in my heart, devils in my eyes\" which I've often equated to myself (I give off that \"do not touch\" vibe all to often, but treat people pretty well). The chorus, like many on the album, is pretty catchy, and the song has a feeling of standard Heavy Metal spliced with Thrash's energy.\n\nOverall the record does a good job of reminding of \"Sound of White Noise,\" but gives off the impression of a band that has grown musically and mellowed out a tad--as though they're finally accepting that Metal is no longer the king in more popular music, and went back to doing what they like. Unlike \"Stomp 442\" this doesn't occasionally reek of \"trying to maintain a presence in an Alternative world.\" Everything here is Metal, even if the thrash has calmed a little. It's guitar-heavy, rather the way Metal should be, not bass-heavy like a lot of crap coming out around the time this album was released (or like now for that matter). \n\nNo Anthrax/John Bush fan should miss, especially as his vocals sound better than ever and run a frantic gamut from fierce yelling to passive singing (Inside Out is a good example). To me it's a step up from arguably the best John Bush-led Anthrax, SoWN, making this one just as good if not better.\n",
        "\nThis is the best live album from Anthrax. The Island Years is tough to beat and Music Of Mass Destruction is certainly one or the best live album of the year. Everything is perfect; the guitars, the bass, the drums and... well the vocals aren't like Belladonna but it's alright, after listening to We've Come For You All many times it doesn't do a big difference. But I think that Anthrax fans from the 80's will have a different point of view of John Bush vocals perfomed live.\n\nAll the songs were great, like a best of but perfomed with a crazy crowd! Bello and Ian seem to never get old. You got to admit that this was an amazing perfomance for a 20 years band! \n\nFrom the first track to the eleventh it's nice but listening to Fueled, a song from the dark ages of Anthrax, is awful. Metal Thrasing Mad was there to finish the album on a good note.\n\nIf you buy Music Mass Destruction, you got to heard Caught In A Mosh and What Doesn't Die to get a good taste of what to come.\n",
        "\nBack in 1987 Anthrax was still hailed as a speed metal band. They had just released their swansong Among the Living. The tour was obviously long, because the band released this during it. But what the hell? Rap? On Anthrax record? Vital for these fellas, the history has shown it, but was this completely necessary? I mean, should the metal band go to the rap territory, where it doesn't belong?\n\nI don't mind rap, to some point at least. So I consider half of ep's material pure crap. The title is here three times! We have censored radio version, uncensored version and the live version. \"I'm the man\" two times in a row starts this ep. The distorted guitar(s) is/are still here, but it/they could have been louder. These tracks are not a full torment, they/it dont't fit into Top 20 Anthrax songs. There are no differences between the tracks, expects few words. Every band has covered Black Sabbath, and here's the Anthrax's performance. \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" is chosen to be the song. The song is a bit modified by the band. Joey Belladonna's vocals sound rather funny here, they don't fit. It seems that Anthrax wanted to do second cover, because the track ends with the \"Sweet Leaf\" guitar riff.\n\nWhat about the \"I'm the Man\"'s live version. I better say nothing. Except that you might get sick of \"I'm the Man\" even before the ep ends. Three times playing it will ensure it. I personally think that the highlights of the ep are still ahead. \"Caught in a Mosh\" is so funny as always. The song hasn't suffered too much in live conditions, but it still sounds a bit anonymous compared with studio version. The Judge Dredd tribute \"I am the Law\" suffers from the same problems. Guitar riff demolished as always, but it would crush better if it wouldn't sound like it's buried six feet under.\n\nThis ep gives very inconsistent feelings. You can't listen some of the ep's material no more than three times at maximum. \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" is average cover and the live versions of \"Caught in a Mosh\" and \"I am the Law\" are good songs, but with some technical problems. Anthrax has made much better cross-over songs (eg \"Bring the Noize\") than this. This is strange.\n",
        "\nThis album kind of reminded me of Persistence of Time, not in the speed and intensity as much as in the melody. This album is filled with melodious tunes and I could swear that it also reminds me of Armored Saint\u2019s Symbol of Salvation at times, especially the third track, \u201cRoom For One More.\u201d This is a fine occurrence as I have enjoyed Armored Saint\u2019s album very much. The characteristic, which is most similar to Armored Saint, is the vocals. They have almost a raspy sound in certain parts of the album. As opposed to some of the other albums by Anthrax where the music is heavy, while the vocals do not coincide very well with it, as they are sung in a very non-aggressive manner. The relatively aggressive sound of this album corresponds with the matching vocals very sufficiently.\n\nThe album offers some aggressive songs, with catchy and violent riffs, and some songs that are more melodic in nature. Some of the songs, such as the highlight, \u201cHy Pro Glo,\u201d combine the two different styles to make one killer song. Going from more mellow vocals, to a full drum beat and vocal assault within a few seconds. I do not understand why people overlook this album, it offers such high-quality and head-banging songs, yet is an underrated album in the Anthrax discography.\n\nSome of the tracks, such as \u201c1000 Points of Hate\u201d and \u201cThis is not an Exit,\u201d do get a bit repetitive due to the non-changing riffs or bland choruses. These are the only songs that do not stand out on the album. Every other song stands out, since each one offers something new and exciting, such as \u201cBlack Lodge,\u201d which is a softer song and uses a more melodic approach. Variety is almost excessive on this album, which is an excellent trait for an album to possess.\n\nThis album offers very memorable choruses and melodies, and is a sound addition in the Anthrax discography. Songs such as \u201cC11 H17 N2 O2 S Na,\u201d offer an aggressive drum and guitar solo approach, \u201cBlack Lodge.\u201d offers a softer, more melodic approach, and \u201cHy Pro Glo,\u201d mixes the two techniques to make this album well rounded. Sound of White Noise is a fine Traditional Melodic Thrash Metal album.\n",
        "\nThis was my first Anthrax album and it blew me away. The intensity of the songs, the wild riffs, the memorable lyrics and choruses are what make this album a reliable listen. This album is very different in comparison to other Anthrax albums. For example, this album is more concentrated on constant melodies and contains a more intense drum performance as opposed to some of the other album in the discography, such as Spreading the Disease, which is more centered on guitar performance. The guitars and bass are also heavier on this album as opposed to some of the other albums, which have a higher pitched sound. The vocals are also more melodic in nature as opposed to short, almost monotonous vocals in Spreading the Disease. This is very apparent in songs such as \u201cBlood,\u201d where the vocals are very tuneful.\n\nThe album opens up with a ticking clock, cleverly so, as the album is called Persistence of Time, and the song is titled \u201cTime.\u201d Once the guitars and vocals come in, it\u2019s a full on assault on your ears. The intensity of the guitar riffs is prevalent throughout the entire album, as are the melodic vocals. \u201cBlood,\u201d which is the second track is also one of the highlights of the album with its memorable chorus and catchy riffs. \n\n\"Blood on Your Hands, Blood in My Eyes \nBlood I Can't Keep, Blood Circumscribes \nBlood on Your Hands Turns into Blood in My Eyes \nAnd with the Blood I Can't Keep \nOur Lives, Blood Circumscribes\"\n\nThese are some of the captivating lyrics that the album is packed with. Pleasurable lyrics to sing along to are a strong point of this album.\n\nThe songs that don\u2019t have equivalent liveliness to the other songs are the third and ninth tracks, \u201cKeep it in the Family\u201d and \u2018H8 Red,\u2019 respectively. They\u2019re a bit dull at times, perhaps due to a lack of the speed of the previous songs. Certain parts demonstrate the excellent guitar riffs and solos of the previous songs, but it does not have the same memorable sound. This is not a big deal as the fourth and tenth tracks, respectively, redeem your interest in the album.\n\n\u201cIn My World\u201d is another highlight due to the heavy riffs and extremely catchy lyrics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid, I\u2019m not afraid,\nNothing touches me; I\u2019m a walking razorblade,\nFace the face of fear; face the face of death,\nLaugh when other tears, Hate when others laugh\u2026\u201d\n\nThese lyrics are one of the most enjoyable lyrics I have sung in some time. The guitar riffs and drum work coincide with the melodic vocals very adequately. The Speed Metal characteristic is very prevalent in this song, especially towards the end, where the guitar sound gets much higher and faster as opposed to most of the rest of the album\u2019s guitar work.\n\nThe best genre that fits this album would be \u201cmelodic thrash metal.\u201d Songs such as \u201cGridlock\u201d and \u201cGot the Time,\u201d are great examples of the superfluous melody contained in this album, changing from song to song, you never get bored, as most of the melody is not recycled over and over again. The riffs in each song are, overall, pretty different and offer variety to the album. Hearing the same riff over and over again gets stale very fast, even if the melody and originality are present.\n\nThe sixth track, \u201cIntro to Reality,\u201d is a suitable instrumental track. It is a calmer song containing simple drum and guitar work and the bass is constant and holds the melody stable. It gets relatively faster towards the end of the song and goes right into the best song on the album, \u201cBelly of the Beast.\u201d \u201cBelly of the Beast,\u201d contains all of the traits that make this album one of the best Anthrax albums. Melody, riffs, memorable and original lyrics, excellent background drum work and did I say melody? Holy shit this song makes me want to listen to the album over again. Such strong listens as \u201cTime,\u201d \u201cBlood,\u201d \u201cIn My World\u201d and \u201cBelly of the Beast,\u201d make this album a pleasurable listening experience.\n\n\u201cGot the Time,\u201d the Joe Jackson cover offers a rapid head banging good time. It is a faster paced Anthrax song, and is another highlight on the album. Intensity and speed are the best words to describe this album. This song illustrates the passion that Anthrax demonstrates throughout most of this album.\n\n\u201cOne Man Stands,\u201d and \u201cDischarge\u201d are decent listens, although the riffs and melody start to get recycled, especially on the last track which, at the beginning, sounds like parts of \u201cBlood.\u201d They\u2019re still strong additions to the album, even though they\u2019re not the best songs.\n\nIf you call yourself an Anthrax fan you should definitely get this album, as it is one of their best, right along with Spreading the Disease. If you want a fun album to listen to, pick up Persistence of Time. It is unquestionably a superior Anthrax release.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the heavier albums by Anthrax, but it is also a bit unexciting. There are only a few good songs that I can recall that have some sort of replay value. \u201cAmong The Living,\u201d \u201cCaught in a Mosh,\u201d and \u201cIndians,\u201d are the only songs that stand out in this album. What they achieve in heaviness they lose in lyrical catchiness as opposed to other albums in their discography such as Spreading the Disease or Persistence of Time.\n\nThis album is definitely heavy, as can be heard on songs such as \u201cI am the Law\u201d and \u201cOne World.\u201d These songs are as, or even more so, aggressive like the highlight songs I have mentioned before, but they lack the memorable choruses and melodies, which make the other songs superior. The deficiency of this album is definitely the lack of compatibility between the heaviness of the riffs and vocals and the overall structural melodies and lyrics. Persistence of Time had its heavy songs, but each of those songs had something to offer. Heaviness is not the most important object a band such as this should aspire for, it is how a listener will remember the album. If one can only recall three or four tracks that they enjoyed the objective has not been achieved, in my opinion anyway.\n\nAnthrax has put out an album that, although was heavy and had some great riffs, was not very memorable. This aspect, which they failed to attain, is an important portion of a thrash album. The highlighted songs, especially \u201cIndians,\u201d was relatively softer than the other songs, yet was better overall because of the catchy choruses and melodic riffs.\n\nOn the whole, this album is moderate. It does offer some excellent tracks, yet comes up short with such songs as, \u201cEfilnikufesin (N.F.L.). This shouldn\u2019t be the first Anthrax album in one\u2019s collection as it is a bit lackluster compared to the other Anthrax albums. The best place to get introduced to Anthrax would be, Persistence of Time, Spreading the Disease or Fistful of Metal, among others. Overall this is a 2nd rank Anthrax album.\n",
        "\nAfter hearing some of the later albums by Anthrax, I was a bit skeptical when it came to giving this album a listen. I was never a huge Anthrax fan, mostly because of the vocals on some of the albums that I have listened to. This album changed my whole view of the band, proving thus again, that when it comes to being introduced to a band it is usually wise to start towards the beginning of their careers. \n\nThe first three songs of the album are mediocre, as compared to the rest of the album, with \u201cMadhouse\u201d being the best. The next three are better, but \u201cThe Enemy\u201d was practically a filler in my opinion. It could almost pass of as a Power Metal or Traditional Metal song in the vein of Armored Saint. \u201cAftershock\u201d and \u201cS.S.C./Stand Or Fall\u201d are the thrashier songs on the album, the latter being the better track, both in composition and overall structure.\n\nThis album is truly great, mainly due to a bit of a NWOBHM influence in the songwriting and sound of some of the songs. One instance of this is the song \u201cMedusa\u201d, which is also one of the highlights of the album. The first time I heard it, I could have swore I was listening to Grim Reaper. Sort of reminded me of \u201cNight of the Vampire\u201d for some reason. Although \u201cMedusa\u201d is thrashier, it does have a heavy metal sound to it. If Anthrax continued with this sound throughout their career they would have easily been one of my more listened bands. Along with \u201cArmed and Dangerous\u201d and \u201cGung-Ho,\u201d the last three songs are what the album should have sounded like.\n\nAlthough I have no actual problems with this album, I would have enjoyed it much more if it had more thrash. More songs like \u201cGung-Ho\u201d would have been nice, along with a \u201cMedusa\u201d here and there. The overall mood of this album is satisfying, as it gets better the more you progress into the album. In the end I was satisfied, but if you are looking for thrash do not come here, but pick up a Kreator or Sodom album instead. If you are looking for a great metal album or if you want to introduce yourself or someone else to Anthrax this album will surely suffice.\n",
        "\nNice to have you back, guys. After a couple of disappointing albums - Stomp 442 and Volume 8: The Threat Is Real (I was far less impressed with Stomp than the tracks I heard from Volume 8, for anyone wondering), Anthrax have roared back with their best album with John Bush at frontman. This album isn't exactly thrash, but it is music we all know they are capable of making.\n\nThe music and rhythm is more groove based and the production is surprisingly good, considering how Anthrax is given credit as the main producers on this album. Almost every song is a highlight in some way, as most of the songs here are either excellent or very good. There is only one totally throwaway track (\"Black Dahlia\"), which lacks inspiration and direction, but that cannot be said about the rest of the tracks here. For anybody wondering, there are no collaborations with rappers, which in my opinion, is a good thing. \"Contact/What Doesn't Die\" greets us first, with the stutter riffing in the beginning of \"What Doesn't Die\" being very good. John Bush sounds incredibly inspired in the chorus of this song, and the rest of the band backs him very well with just as much inspiration. \"Superhero\" has a nice groove in the chorus, and \"Refuse To Be Denied\" does as well. The guitar playing is somewhat slower than the norm though.\n\n\"Safe Home\" is a ballad, and got some airtime on my local active rock station, as this is probably as close to radio-safe as they get on WCFYA. It sounds a lot like \"Black Lodge\" (from The Sound Of White Noise). Charlie Benante's drumming in \"Nobody Knows Anything\" is some of the best I've heard from him since the Among The Living album, and check out the tribute to Judas Priest at the end of \"Strap It On\". It sounds a little like \"Love Bites\" (from Defenders Of The Faith). \"Cadillac Rock Box\" has a nice winding chorus, as well as some good rhythm guitar playing, while \"Think About An End\" and \"W.C.F.Y.A\" end the disc with a slight thrash edge. Two fairly unique songs, and a great way to end the album. Both tracks would also make a great ending to an Anthrax show, now that I think of it.\n\nOne of the best CD's of 2003, and a keeper at that!\n",
        "\nWow, Anthrax created a real barnstormer of a record here, abandoning the rather stilted and predictable(albeit entertaining) sound of the past few releases to create a new sound full of electric hardcore, the goofy tude and punked-out speed of the S.O.D, with a hint of the Bay Area Thrash discipline, the sound that would make Anthrax famous, and in the process one of thrash's Big Four.\n\nAnd man, what a calling card! Among the Living is a non-stop, relentless, freak out of an album, rendering Spreading the Disease plodding, showing us another way to blitzkrieg besides the Reign in Blood/Darkness Descends wall o' insanity. Blistering tempo's, stumbling vocals (check Joey trying to keep up on the \"Indians\" chorus), and ballsy NYC attitude. Anthrax was probably more influential than say, Megadeth, because of how many elements of the band's sound ended up in other places. That big bellowing army of back-up singers was everywhere in the second-tier thrashers(granted, Exodus had it too, but never as well or as famously), the goofy acronym titles(\"N.F.L\" \"A.D.I\", etc.), and even the high-pitched Halford-wannabe on the stick(with more witless charm than the technically superb Metal Church singers), which by it's very contrariness to the Hetfield/Araya vocal style must have stuck out like a sore thumb, giving us bands like Flotsam and Jetsam in the process.\n\nAnyway, the album. \"Among the Living\" is actually one of the tracks I'm not such a huge fan of, but it's an excellent showcase for those off-kilter song structures and frankly bizarre Belladonna vocal melodies, allowing us to watch the skinny little bastard trying to come up with something that follows a song that winds like a broken-backed snake. Plus, I dig the newfound belligerence and anger, even if it is on a Stephen King tribute song/album.\n\n\"Caught in a Mosh\" is just brilliant, up there with \"Whiplash\" and \"The Toxic Waltz\" on the thrash anthems chart, probably beating them with it's ludicrous ludicrous-speed (Spaceballs!) speed, headbanging moshpit-ready breakdown, and truly hilarious lyrics. \"Stomp stomp stomp/The idiot convention/ Which one of these words don't you understand?\" Comedic genius, with a shout along chorus that ranks as the best in their impressive catalogue. This song probably makes me look like I'm having a seizure, what with the thrashing being so hardkore. \n\n\"I Am the Law\" is a 'Thrax classic, again I mysteriously don't enjoy it that much. Still, fun riffery, yet another moshtastic break, and some dopey sing-alongs. DROK IT!\n\n\"N.F.L\" is a great tune, spinning a vitriolic and rather effective tale of woe, the first hint of seriousness of any substance on the album. The riffs are pretty loose too, but still more focused than the almost wobbly title track with its occasionally mystifying melodies and tempo changes. Nice solo too. I believe this is about comedian John Belushi's tragic death, which Anthrax seems somewhat ticked about. Anyway, it's just another example of a band going completely off the wall and writing outside the box, although I doubt that Anthrax was going about it with the focused intention to reshape the boundaries of metal like an Anacrusis or a Watchtower.\n\n\"Skeleton in the Closet\" is based on the Stephen King story \"Apt Pupil\", good material for metal, even if Anthrax is too over-the-top mosh-pit ready for themes this deep, and they don't exactly spend much time trying to really get a message out of it. Still, love that chorus, Joey hammering the listener with repetitive questions, not that many cared back in '87 when they were trying to learn all the patterns to headbang properly.\n\nNow here's a fun one, \"Indians\" being a total Maiden tribute, while in my eyes beating the high holy hell out of \"Run to the Hills\". Check that steely twin lead intro, Joey's Bruce-alike phrasing and soaring high notes, hell even that break seems spiritually Maiden-esque, although it's really just a standard mosher with an atonal solo, albeit an atonal solo full of attitude. That's one thing about 'Thrax, they can fuck up a lot, but who cares when they have such a great attitude? It's one of the things that really hobbled the more recent material in my view. Also, special notice to that chorus, a jumbled mass of speed-reading that you helplessly try to sing along too despite its difficulty. Great, great stuff.\n\nNow, my personal favourites on the album back to back. \"One World\" ditches the scrambling structures for some bolted down Metallica-esque aggression, this song being a lean mean thrashin' machine. That riff is loud and hard, Belladonna screaming (for vengeance?) like he rarely can (or bothers to), and man, nice Benante drumming and vicious dual axework from Ian and Spitz. Just an unsung classic, check it out folks.\n\n\"A.D.I/The Horror of it All\" is the serious epic, sort of along the lines of \"Like Father, Like Son\" from Exodus's Fabulous Disaster, but better. All mid-tempo venom, with a number of strong strong leads, a reserved yet powerful Belladonna, and man, I love that little riff that transitions the verse and chorus under the \"saaaaaay goooodbye...\" bit. Mesmerizing, and also a fair argument to include Anthrax in the same artistic breath as Metallica and Megadeth, trumping every effort at the epic the band had tried thus far (sorry \"Armed and Dangerous\"), as well as pointing the crooked finger towards the titanic Persistence of Time.\n\nAs such, \"Imitation of Life\" comes off as a little tossed off, a little forced, a bit of a letdown after the preceding three tracks. But man, lyrically it's a ball, Joey Belladonna going all comedic again for a hilarious send-up of record/TV execs, describing a battle Anthrax would win after this release because of its platinum-certified success that allowed them to do more or less whatever they wanted.\n\nAll in all, the high water mark in the Anthrax catalogue, and their most indelible contribution to metal, even if their most influential was probably the I'm the Man EP.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Caught in a Mosh\", \"The Horror of it All\", \"One World\"\n",
        "\nAnthrax had all but descended back into relative obscurity. They had just released 1998's Volume 8 through Ignition Records, when said label went bankrupt, which effectively left Anthrax without a label and without distribution of volume 8. More turmoil followed, with the departure of longtime touring guitarist Paul Crook (quite possibly frustrated with never being asked to join as a full-time member), the Maximum Rock And Roll tour fiasco, and the public outcry over their name due to the anthrax scare (in which they apparently temporarily changed their name to Basket Full Of Puppies). Five years later, Anthrax finally released their new full-length album We've Come For You All.\n\nThis album is essentially a continuation of their work since the arrival of John Bush. The songs are more vocal-based, which to me isn't really a problem given John Bush's voice, with the guitars supplying a more groove-based rhythm as opposed to the ripping thrash tunes of the Belladonna era. However, this album sees a small incorporation of their older thrash-style, most notably in Charlie Benante's drumming. The combination of the straightforward rock along with the thrash influences makes this Anthrax's strongest album in years. \n\nThe Cast\n\nJohn Bush (vocals) - I swear, this guy consistently improves with each recording that he does. For the most part he seems to stay in a lower range through most of the album, preferring to use a powerful throaty delivery. However, some of the range that he used in Armored Saint (which for the most part has been absent since he joined Anthrax) is employed fleetingly in\ncertain tracks.\n\nScott Ian (guitars) - Scott Ian's guitar attack is tight as usual, although mostly taking on a groove-based feel. A few of his rhythm tricks show up in areas, such as the blastbeat sections of Black Dahlia and some areas of What Doesn't Die, but for the most part he favours a pulsating down-picked rhythm. \n\nRob Caggiano (lead guitars) - Caggiano's role in Anthrax is mainly being a touring guitarist, and as such doesn't contribute much to the album. His lead style seems rather conventional, as seen on Nobody Knows Anything and What Doesn't Die. Special mention goes to his work on Safe Home, which is melodic and quick without being too sloppy. \n\nFrank Bello (bass, vocals) - Frank is still continuing with his trademark style, holding down the bottom-end and locking in tight with Benante, while adding licks in here and there to keep it interesting. \n\nCharlie Benante (drums, guitars) - The other member of Anthrax that seems to consistently be improving with every album, Charlie Benante supplies most of the power to this album, with some of his craziest work showing up here. Top spots include the blastbeats in Black Dahlia, the incessant double-bass towards the end of What Doesn't Die, and Nobody Knows Anything, which is more like an extended drum solo underneath the song. Benante also continues laying down guitar tracks as he has been since Persistence Of Time, contributing the bulk of the leadwork. His style seems to be more understated. Overall, an excellent performance from Benante.\n\nProduction was handled by Scrap 60 (Caggiano, Eddie Wohl and Steve Regina) in conjunction with Anthrax, and the result is one of the best mixes achieved by Anthrax. The guitars are processed clearer than in the past, and the drums are perfectly mixed, sounding better than any of Anthrax's previous mixes. Bush's voice is pushed to the front, keeping with the more rock oriented feel of the album. The overall feel is quite bass-heavy, due to the detuned guitars and a good bass presence. \n\nChoice Cuts\n\nWhat Doesn't Die - This one starts with a staccato guitar section before going into an uptempo verse reminiscent of some of their early work (Be All, End All in particular) before descending into a slow funky chorus. It also features a trademark Anthrax midsection featuring one of the few leads from Caggiano, before picking up into a double-bass drenched outro. Good way to kick off the album (if you don't count Contact). \n\nSafe Home - Seems to be the closest thing to a ballad that I've ever heard out of Anthrax, and it features a tightly played verse section from Ian, and a chorus that shows off John Bush's vocal talents. This cut speeds up toward the end and features another lead from Caggiano (who is tremendously under-utilised given he's the new lead guitarist), which turns out to be the best lead on the album. \n\nAny Place But Here - Although not being all that heavy, this is a really catchy tune with a tightly played verse featuring trademark work by Ian, and an uptempo chorus featuring a catchy vocal harmony. This also features another lead from Caggiano (bringing up the total lead count to 3 so far).\n\nNobody Knows Anything - I never really understood why Lar$ Ulrich got all the recognition that Benante should get, as Benante is ten times (at least) the drummer Ulrich is, with only 10% of the recognition. This song, which is more of an extended drum solo, shows exactly why I believe this is so. This song shows Benante working a basic beat and gradually building on it with some insane double bass and snare work. This is perhaps the track that bares the most resemblance to Anthrax's early days.\n\nBlack Dahlia - This one seems more than a little out of place here, but is quite enjoyable if you like blastbeats. The song starts out with a pulsating midtempo section which moves along nicely, until out of nowhere it morphs temporarily into a grindcore-esque section punctuated with blastbeats and tremolo-picked riffing before returning to the midtempo feel of the previous section.\n\nOff Cuts\n\nContact and Crash - These two tracks are complete filler and serve no useful purpose whatsoever. \n\nRaw Sewage\n\nN/A.\n\nClosing Comments\n\nThose still hoping for a return to the thrash sound of their earlier days can pretty much give up now, but if you don't mind a more hard-rock style infused with some thrash elements, then this is for you. Definitely the best effort they've made since Persistence Of Time.\n",
        "\nAnthrax had taken themselves to a new level with the release of 1988's State Of Euphoria, with the singles Antisocial and Make Me Laugh gaining them much recognition. However, internal difficulties within the band resulted in the temporary departure of Joey Belladonna (although that could have been before the recording of State Of Euphoria, I'm not really sure). This recording was not without difficulties, with an earthquake and a fire in band's house occurring during the recording of the basic tracks in Hollywood, destroying $100,000+ worth of equipment. In 1990, Persistence Of Time was recieved with great anticipation from metalheads everywhere. This was also the last full-length featuring Joey Belladonna, who only stayed on for the EP before being fired in 1992 due to personal differences and an apparent drinking problem.\n\nI guess the infighting and the troublesome recording of the basic tracks really pissed them off, because this is far and away their most intense and darkest record they have ever done. Early Anthrax always had this light-hearted edge that seemed to make their music a little more enjoyable while still sounding heavy. That light-hearted edge is DEAD AND BURIED and never to rise again on this album, and the album is all the better for it. All participants on this album have taken their individual performances to yet another level. Never before has Scott Ian's rhythm guitar been more punishing. Never before has Dan Spitz's leads been more impeccable. Never before has Frank Bello's bass work been more pulsating or Charlie Benante's drumming been so totally over-the-top and awe-inspiring, or Joey Belladonna's voice been more emotive. Never before have they written a meaner riff or a more aggressive song. Never before had Anthrax reached this peak, and as time would tell, they would never reach it again.\n\nThe Cast\n\nJoey Belladonna (vocals) - Joey gives in a similar performance to his work on State Of Euphoria, with perhaps a little lower choice of notes. His voice also retains some the fire it had in areas of State Of Euphoria and intensifies it, and uses it more often. Great swansong from Joey.\n\nScott Ian (guitar) - It was difficult for just about anyone to top his prior performances. However, Scott Ian has stepped up to the crease and done just that. Not only that, he somehow manages to hit said prior performances for six! His rhythm playing seems to have become even tighter, and his riffing has taken on an even more oppressive feel than before. Far and away his best performance. This is evident on the hyper-speed track Gridlock, which features a faster and yet tighter display of speed picking. \n\nDan Spitz (guitar) - Another one who has improved on all past performances, Spitz takes the style he was working on in State Of Euphoria and takes it to a new level. This album features his most stunning leadwork to date. Of particular note are his leads on Time and One Man Stands. Melodic, concise, and with just the right amount of shredding interspersed within the lead.\n\nFrank Bello (bass) - This is where Bello shows what an underrated bassist he really is. I remember reading an interview where he said he wanted to keep the rhythm steady, but throw some licks in here and there to keep things interesting. In that quote he has summed up his performance here to a T. Of particular note is his bass solo in the Joe Jackson cover Got The Time, where he plays a few taseful lines, being careful not to overdo it.\n\nCharlie Benante (drums) - If there was any one member who was the most pissed off during the recording sessions, it would be Charlie himself. Like Scott Ian, he not only manages to match his past performances, but surpass them too. He is at his most fill-happy here, and throws them in with an alarming nonchailance as if this sort of thing is far too easy for him. Of particular note in this regard is in Discharge, where he regularly pulls off fills that will make your jaw drop, not only because of the fills played, but because of the frightening ease at which he pulls them off. His double bass is also used to great effect here too, pulled out quite regularly to enhance particularly punishing sections but without overdoing it. This is the first album where Charlie tries his hand at guitar, playing harmony lines with Scott Ian on Intro To Reality, doing a competent job. \n\nProduction was once again handled by Mark Dodson, this time in conjunction with Anthrax. Anthrax's input here is obvious, with the clear, yet lighter mix of State Of Euphoria replaced with a production that is dark, ominous and obscenely heavy. The guitars are much more crushing than usual, and Spitz's lead tone is similar to the previous album. Joey Belladonna is mixed to the front as per usual (given his voice, they'd be stupid not to). Frank Bello has some real presence here, and Charlie's kit has never sounded better. \n\nChoice Cuts\n\nTime - One listen to this and you know you're in for one hell of a dark and intense ride. An odd-timed riff here carries most of the song, which is an excercise in violence to say the least. This song features an emotive performance from Belladonna, some absolutely suffocating rhythm playing, and perhaps the best lead Dan Spitz has ever put to tape. Great way to start off.\n\nIn My World - The intensity shown in this track is downright frightening. Although a great deal slower than some of the other cuts, this is the most oppressive and darkest track on the album. An exceptionally tight performance from Ian and some incredible fills from Benante, capped off by an emotive lead from Spitz.\n\nGridlock - Perhaps the most up-tempo song on the disc, Gridlock starts off with a riff that seems esceptionally fast, even for Scott Ian, and some nice tom-work from Benante. This cut slows down in the verse sections and allows Belladonna to give an uncharacteristically aggressive vocal performance. \n\nIntro To Reality/Belly Of The Beast - This track starts off with a pretty clean guitar line, which is gradually built upon with harmony guitar lines. The song then gives way to Belly Of The Beast, which has such a compelling rhythm and exceptionally tight rhythm work, it is impossible NOT to try to eject your brain through your eyesocket through headbanging. Excellent song.\n\nOne Man Stands - THE best song on the album, this carries one nasty oppressive riff, and an aggression and intensity only surpassed by In My World. The lyrical topic here deals with the oppression of people by the powers that be, which explains the intimidating nature of the song. The chorus is exceptionally catchy, especially the last time that it's done. Of \nparticular note is the lead from Spitz, which rivals Time as his best lead, and a chilling vocal performance from Belladonna that rates as one of his best.\n\nDischarge - An exceptionally violent closing cut featuring impressive rhythm work, a hair-raising performance from Benante and one of Belladonna's angriest vocal performances. Perhaps their most violent closing cut since Imitation Of Life. \n\nClosing Comments\n\nThe mindset of the band around the time of the recording must have been beyond vile, because this is easily their most pissed-off recording and one of the most vicious thrash LP's I've ever heard. Do not hesitate to buy this. Sell your dog if you have to.\n",
        "\nContrary to what many believe, I feel this is a very good effort from Anthrax that is a step above Sound of White Noise.\n\nTheir sound has definately changed a lot since the thrash days. Here they rely more on vocal melodies and commercial sounds, but the riffs are still important enough to keep things from faltering, unlike on their later efforts. The guitar uses drop D tuning that combines with a good production to give the guitars a somewhat modern, heavy effect, but that effect is not over the top. \n\nHighlights of the album include the first 3 tracks (\"Random Acts of Senseless Violence\", \"Fueled\", and \"King Size\"), \"Nothing\", and \"Bare\". Unlike most albums in which the strongest material is centered at the beginning, this album never feels like it drops off too much, which is a testament to its strength. \"Nothing\" relies heavily on vocal melodies, but in this case it just fucking works. \"Bare\" is a very interesting track. It is a ballad, and I very rarely consider a ballad to be one of the better tracks on an album, but I really enjoy this song. It is quite different from a normal ballad and sounds nothing like Anthrax have ever done, before or after Stomp 442. \n\nI wouldn't consider anything on this album to be bad. The worst song is probably \"In a Zone\", but it is just kind of boring, and there is nothing especially wrong with it. Another drop in quality can be found in the pseudo-thrash break/middle section of \"American Pompeii\". For some reason, the pseudo-thrash break in \"Drop the Ball\" is quite a bit better.\n\nThis is a consistent, original, and interesting album from Anthrax. It is not very similar to anything they (or any other bands for that matter) have ever done. The only thing keeping this album from receiving a very high rating is the lack of any truly amazing tracks.\n",
        "\nBeing the first Anthrax album I owned, I used to play this an awful lot, along with the next album \"Among The Living\" which I got a short while after. Both those albums were just gradually left to gather dust as many new and interesting bands started to come by me thick and fast. But looking back on them, at first this one and realising it's not an album destined for the title of \"got bored by it\", as it still very much kicks my ass! It's a good starting point for getting into the band, and a thrash newbie should make this one of his/her early pickups. It's a very fun and lively power flavoured thrash album with plenty of those \"mosh\" moments! We get treated to that Anthrax crunching rhythm guitar, squealing lead guitar, and the soaring vocals of then new frontman Joey Belladonna, with a perfect singing voice, he'll always be a rather unique figure in thrash. The catchy and energetic songs are a fullproof trap for a potential fan, and even for hardened thrashers as well (but then again it's quite likely they will already own this album!). The songs are pretty standard in the school of thrash songwriting, not meaning to indicate any averageness but as in they are the general standard! A complete defiance of mainstream structures and techniques, but never becoming oversaturated in complexity. Each song is written this way, aside from perhaps the slightly more adventurous \"Armed And Dangerous\", though each is its own distinct slice of the whole, and when it starts good, it stays good! The fantastic metal feast of \"A.I.R.\" (with that unforgettable bridge riff that still makes me go crazy), the album's \"hit\" \"Madhouse\", \"The Enemy\" and \"Armed And Dangerous\" could each contend very strongly for my top 10 favourite thrash songs. (Though the start of \"Armed And Dangerous\" is just a little bit too loud... hehe).\n\nThe standard occassionally drops a notch from excellent to very good on \"Aftershock\", \"Medusa\" and the fast but slightly faltering \"Gung-Ho\", though there's nothing on this album that approaches the category of \"skippable\" or \"filler\". The songs jump between teenage and social themes, along with military satire with \"Armed And Dangerous\" and \"Gung-Ho\", it's kind of usual thrash fare, but in Anthrax's own way. Many claim \"Among The Living\" as the best example of the band's work, but \"Spreading The Disease\" for me is nonetheless an excellent album, and an essential addition to any thrash fan's collection. It won't be forgotten any time soon.\n",
        "\nEP's are interesting things...some of them serve as a stopgap between albums, a way for the record label to make some extra money and make sure you don't forget about their band while the next album, for whatever reason, takes forever to come out. Other EPs are there to say goodbye to an old member - putting out whatever last songs were recorded with him/her before it all falls apart (Sentenced's Love & Death EP comes to mind) Then we have EPs like this: Ostensibly, it was to intoduce new singer Joey Belladonna and new bassist Frank Bello (former bassist Danny Lilker's bass tech) to the world.\n\n\nI remember when this came out back in '85 - I was pretty damned impressed. Now, 18 years later (god, am I getting old!), a good portion of it has held up pretty well, and a good portion, well, just sounds dated!\n\nArmed and Dangerous sounds as stunning now as it did then. Great intro, masterful, well-placed and well-played rhythm work, catchy riffs, tasteful, speedy drumming, and well-played (and, for a Carl Canedy production, surprisingly audible - see Metallica's Kill 'Em All and Overkill's Feel The Fire for an excercise in treble metal) bass.\n\nAfter this great intro, we get the horribly boring original \"Raise Hell\". God, what an inane chorus \"raise hell, raise hell, raise HELL\". If Armed and Dangerous introduced Joey Belladonna at her powerful, clear-voiced best, this song equally introduces him at his whiny, annoying, unconving worst. Subtract an extra 5 points for the world's most annoying rhyme \"I'm on fire, oh, the desire\"... geez, what is this, mid '80's Madonna?!\n\nTheir cover of God Save the Queen is not great, not horrible, but is ultimately throwaway filler in its averageness.\n\n\"Live\" recordings (live in the studio, a la Slayer's Live Undead), Metal Thrashing Mad and Panic are both good, by the numbers thrashers, not a hell of a lot different from the Fistful of Metal versions beyond the new voice... Joey sounds better than Neil on these, although maybe a bit lacking in personality. The intro riff to panic has always been one of my favorites, though! \n\nFinally, the \"Collector's rare tracks\" Soldiers of Metal and Howling Furies. Both decent songs, if not special... tell me the first 15 or so seconds of Soldiers of Metal don't remind you of Metallica's Phantom Lord, and the next 15 of the same album's Four Horsemen. A little labelmate thievery here, kids?\n\nUltimately, if you're an Anthrax fan, an EP well worth having. If not, the only true classic on here is Armed and Dangerous, for which you might as well go out and by Spreading the Disease, which contains the same version of Armed And Dangerous, and is the best damned album Anthrax ever made! (but more about that in another review!) \n\nThis EP doesn't do for me what it did in '85, but it's good for a spin down memory lane every now and then, which makes 7 bucks or whatever it was 18 years ago mighty well spent!\n",
        "\nHaven't I heard this before? And much better done on albums like Reinventing the Steel. Here they take the worst aspects of Pantera (silly Vulgar Display and Far Beyond shit) and throw in some crap a la Machine Head and come up with some rather weak songs. Yes, this is occasionally heavy. No, it isn't good. And yes, there are some mallcore moments too, and even some random hip-hop/techno parts! However, there are the occasional good moments too. So it's not a complete loser - but almost. \n\nFirst song... What Doesn't Die. What a schizophrenic little song. Some cool riffs, and at times there is a nice headbanging groove, but the chorus just fucking sucks - especially the guitar tone underneath it, and John's horrible articulation. Very forced-sounding. Also, the lead guitar is crap - I have no idea who's doing the leads on this album (Charlie?) but he's gotta stop trying to be a weakened version of Dime Darrell. But the verses are cool, with the nifty rhythm guitar underneath it. \n\nSuperhero... this was advertised as a return to Among the Living days. Hah, fucking hah! Check out that really dumb vocals-driven verse passage. Mallcore, kids. Not quite as whiny as Korn, but this is still really fucking shitty. Also, the chorus is again a total miss. Yelling one syllable at a time does not work. Pray! For! Help! Cry! Whatever... dumb effects hurt this one badly as well, as does the general vocals-oriented mix. Scott's rhythm guitar can still be quite good at times, but it is buried very badly in the mix. The final chorus before the middle part is better, because they throw in more lyrics - and the middle section is pretty decent. But again, the solo fucking sucks. This makes Jeff and Kerry sound like the epitome of technicality. Bring back the Jesusboy watchmaker, I say! \n\nRefuse to Be Denied... little \"cute\" intro, then an entirely forgettable riff, and then the verses are totally vocals-oriented. Not quite mallcore, but still this is shit. At least it builds up to a nice pre-chorus and an acceptable chorus. \"I stand and resist!\" But the second guitarist comes and fucks everything up with his dweebish noodling. So far, this is the best song on here, though, because after the first stupid intro verse, it doesn't stop having a continuous riff basis. Plus the middle section is well done, with a nice riff around 2.26 - though I think I'm not the only one that thinks it would work better if it were played at 140% speed. So far this is very slow, very laid back, and missing on some serious aggression. Blood or One Man Stands, this is not. \n\nSafe Home. Hmm, this is such a cheesy song, but why does it work so well for the first few seconds? A little bouncy riff that is bordering on self-parody... oh but it totally falls apart around 0.37 where I suddenly feel like I'm listening to Creed. Bring back the riff. Another schizophrenic little song, with two really bad choruses. It kinda builds up halfway through, though - and that lead guitarist finds approximately one testicle. Hey, it's better than what he had before, and this section harkens back to the Sound of White Noise era. Pretty decent solo when all is said and done, but they should have totally knocked off the first two choruses and done the entire song in the style of the third chorus. \n\nAny Place But Here - little acoustic intro, and then - a great fucking guitar riff!!! Then, the drums come in and kill it. Plodding drums to fuck over that nifty riff - good job, Charlie. Then a far more ordinary groove riff, and we get into a fairly standard modern Anthrax number. But hey, the chorus actually kinda works. Come on, come on! Sounds like a White Noise era chorus. Unfortunately the middle section just drones on and the cool guitars of the intro just turn into yet another lame \"solo\" that goes nowhere and silly vocals, and then another slightly better solo that is still kinda crappy. This would be the best song on here, but for the shitty middle part. Still, though - what a boring song. \n\nNobody Knows Anything... kinda crappy intro riff leads into a slightly better one that would be even better if it didn't pause once every second, and if the second guitarist wasn't fucking around with some stupid effect in the background. Then the part under the vocals - more groove-stuff a la a Pantera album. The chorus would be pretty cool if the drums weren't so mixed so fucking high in the mix and so annoying - and that part after the chorus, that's total fucking hip hop bullshit. Seriously, listen around 1.07 in the song - that is not fucking heavy metal. Yeah kids, let's take the hiphop back. Decent solo, okay riff underneath it, but seriously, someone beat Charlie over the head and turn his drums down a few notches, because they are highly annoying.\n\nStrap It On... hey, now here's a nice opening riff - cut right to the chase and here's the first verse, and the pre-chorus is pretty nice too. Take me back to a golden time!! Unfortunately, the chorus is very shitty. There's the mallcore \"strap it on! strap it on! strap it on!\" jump-teh-fukk-up segment and the boring endless repetition segment. This song has nothing to do with old school, really. Man, they just can't write an entire song that's a winner - gotta throw in some loser passages every once in a while just to keep the fanbase miffed. Decent solo section too - if it weren't for the really uninspired chorus this would be decent.\n\nBlack Dahlia - this is supposed to be the br00tal s00ng of the alb00m. Starts off pretty nice (well, after seven seconds of random shit). The verses are very driven, and remind me nicely of Fueled. Then... around 0.32. What the fucking shitweasel, Batman?? What was that? Someone spliced in some pure noise!! Fucking shitty drums and distorted vocals. Some mallcore/grindcore bastard child. It's like someone decided to have a practical joke at the band's expense and spliced in random segments because that section just doesn't make any sense - not in the context of the verses or the chorus. Cool chorus too, and man those verses are pretty fucking great. Middle section is very short and understated and then one final chorus. There's a good song here, too bad someone sabotaged the final production version.\n\nCadillac Rock Box - dumbfuck \"mighty fine grooving going on on this record here\" intro. What the fuck - is this an advertisement for the people like me that have only the mp3s? \"Buy the album!\" Then an okay riff, but the whole thing gives me a vibe of Black Crowes or something similar. It gets better around 0.52 but is still kinda mediocre. They cranked the \"groove\" up to ungodly new levels, but they threw out the riffs in the meantime. \n\nTaking the Music Back. Okay here we go, here's an intro riff that is worthy. Worthy of Sound of White Noise that is... Spreading the Disease this is not. Oh no, then the verses, and man this is utter shit! No kids, no no no no! That is not how to do a verse passage. Another borderline mallcore segment, especially with the distorted yes-man backing vocals that kinda repeat certain lines only talking out of a prosthetic ass. Okay chorus, I guess. Again, there is nothing overtly spectacular on this album. Some cute sections that don't abjectly suck, but nothing here that totally fucking completely rules. Man this band has gone so far down the shitter that they've dug a hole to China. Stupid middle section will not be acknowledged, especially with the weak-ass solo. \n\nCrash. What the fuck in the name of all that is sacred?? This is pure fucking mallcore here, that's all I gotta say about this one. Utterly fucking worthless.\n\nThink about an End. Yay, finally. Sounds like a good thing to think about, because here's yet another vocals-driven shit passage, with the guitars barely there and playing an eminently forgettable riff. Finally, the rhythm is brought to the forefront... and another eminently forgettable riff. Guys, quit ripping off half the Machine Head catalogue, this is shit! The drums are again way too loud under the verses, the guitars not doing anything worthwhile, and the vocals are left to carry the song. But hey, the chorus is, ironically enough, the best part of the song. The middle section is cool too - now here's some actual riffage! This one almost, but not quite, could be considered thrash! \"Where is all the mercy???\" Fuck, why did they wait this long to throw this in? This is total White Noise, and almost, almost!! could be State of Euphoria. \n\nAh well... can't win 'em all. Give me the new Overkill any day - they're the first, and at this rate, they'll be the last..... Anthrax has gone by the wayside. (And seen a few.) The overall verdict - boring as fuck. There really isn't anything that grabbed me by the genitals and forced me to kill my neighbour. Sorry. Black Dahlia almost did, but just when it was getting good, they threw in that joke of a grindcore interlude. Seriously - these guys are suffering from \"too many dumb interludes\" syndrome. The very last few minutes of the album - Think About an End - are the very best thing they've done since Sound of White Noise, but otherwise it's a loser.\n",
        "\nWhy the hell would you come out with three best of's in a row? It honestly amazes me! So the big story, or so I have heard, around this album was, which songs are going to be on it? To decide this the band threw all there songs into a hat and Scott pulled out the names of the songs that go on there. Musically, the songs are all the same on the originals, what makes this album unworthy in some areas and great in others is the way the songs are displayed. One thing that can automatically go wrong with a compilation album is to put all new stuff on it. Hat my ass Scott, why the hell are there eight new songs in the beginning? First off they open up with Bring the Noise, which probably was never a good idea of making in the first place. Then until track ten, we have all the new stuff with Bush singing. I have nothing against him, but most of these songs are shitty ones I have never heard of. Some of them even sound punkish! The only two songs worth mentioing from the Bush area is Only and Inside Out. Then we start to get better with the old thrash days. Among the Living, Indiands, Antisocial, Madhouse, I am the Law; all classic thrash songs that are probably worth being on this album. And of course what Anthrax album would not be complete without some kind of version of I'm the Man? Of course on this version all the swear words are blooped out. Yes blooped out, with some weird wistley noise. Overall this cd has some great songs and some really shitty ones. A compilation of Anthrax songs, but definently not a best of!!!\n",
        "\nThis is record i think, half metal / half hardcore sounding... A new kind of Anthrax that ended up sounding unique and tasteful by the mix of those styles. Volume 8, although being a great album is not, i repeat, is not an Anthrax album for all Anthrax fans. Older ones could enjoy this or possibily feel displeased with the new sounding of this \"Anthrax goes modern rock\", and new fans can be acquired by the band with this fresh combination of styles, that\u00b4s far, far away from their mosh thrashiest days...\n\nAlthough i find that Joey Belladona is and always will be the ultimate Anthrax singer, and despite not being so enthusiastic about John Bush\u00b4s vocals (can you believe Metallica wanted this guy to sing for them in the beginning of their carrer, instead of Hetfield?), i think he cuts the songs very well and really makes his job...\n\nThis alternative pearl was written almost entirely by drummer Charlie Benante, with only some little musical touches from Scott and Bello here and there...and it starts kicking ass with a really crushing song, \"Crush\" with some great drum beats, almost pounding your heart out when listening to them, and some reeeaaallly groovy guitar sound by Scott. Next comes \"Catharsis\", a quite commercial song but very catchy at the same time, and then comes one of the best songs here...oohhh yes...i\u00b4m talking about \"Inside Out\", with those heavy guitars by Scott and Charlie, those delicious acoustic interludes in the middle of the song, and an amazing fuckin\u00b4solo by their lead guitar player on service for this one: Dimebag Darrell.\n\n\"Piss n\u00b4Vinigar\" does not convince at all as an Anthrax song and it\u00b4s a little bit predictable and a little boring, \"604\" is one of their typical humourous acts, a little thrashy song with some silly lyrics that goes out for 35 sec... and then comes Anthrax\u00b4s really big fuck up on this album...\"Toast to the Extras\" which is not a totally bad song but it\u00b4s really an awful tribute to the country music...avoid this one and skip it...\n\nThen the really good songs return and with a character of their own: \"Born again Idiot\" (great riffs), \"Killing Box\" (with Phil \"drunk\" Anselmo on vocals with Bush), \"Harms Way\" (commercial like, but like \"Catharsis\" very good!), \"Hog Tied\" ( really heavy intro and song) and \"Big Fat\"( not very special but also good...)\n\nAnother funny moment comes with \"Cupajoe\". Remember S.O.D \u00b4s \"Milk\" lyrics? Well this is a progressive speed pacing song of 46 sec that talks about...coffee...simple, but funny...\"Alpha Male\" is no big deal and after it comes another fine moment by Anthrax on this album...\"Stealing from a Thief\", a fuckinigly heavy song with some groove attached to it and a great vibe...The bonus acoustic track is different, but good. Clean melodies and guitar solos with a excelent voice makes this really the perfect way for Anthrax to close this record.\n\nIt\u00b4s a good album, that\u00b4s all i can say...check out if it makes your style or not...but there\u00b4s more than one style to be appreciated here. You can see that this is a really grown up Anthrax with a new sense of things...Old ones, if you have \"Among the Living\" feel satisfied with it and new fans, adquire this album. It\u00b4s worth all of the money.\n",
        "\nMost live albums by metal bands are better than the studio albums. There is a certain energy that metal bands have live that really cannot be captured when you have 754 takes to get it right. However, if such atmosphere is not captured, the album tends to be a mixed bag. \n\nThis is one of those albums. The performance is unquestionable - Anthrax giving it their all - but the recording is just flat and lifeless. The footage was shot, but never used, until the record label wanted to milk Anthrax (who had jumped ship to Elektra or something) one last time, so they released some stock footage - part of a concert (10000 people) and part of a live-in-the-studio thing (60 people).\n\nThe setlist is pretty decent, though they only play two songs from the latest album at the time, Persistence of TIme (Keep it in the Family and In My World). They do a lot of the Among the Living album, which seems to be their favourite, even though I vehemently disagree... at least they do the classic Caught in a Mosh and the almost as good Efilnikufesin, but they ruin it with the average Indians and the bad I am the Law. They also do Bring the Noise, and one or more of the dudes from Public Enemy join them.\n\nAlso, the album suffers from a total lack of continuity - 7 songs from one place and 5 from another, from a time when they were headlining with 15-song sets. This is not a must-have album. There are bootlegs that are better than this, really.\n",
        "\nHere is where Anthrax really developed their trademark sound, full of mosh riffs and shouted backup vocals. Overall, it's not a bad album, but sometimes it does get a bit repetitive - it's not done as well as other New York thrash albums like Taking Over (Overkill) or Survive (Nuclear Assault).\n\nThere are definite highlights here. The opener, \"Among the Living\" is pretty nice, and \"Caught in a Mosh\" is a fucking masterpiece. The main break in the middle, that's textbook New York thrash right here. Stop whatever it is you're doing, and play an entirely new riff at a different tempo, usually about 70% as fast as the previous riff. \"Imitation of Life\" is catchy as fuck, and originally it was an S.O.D. song that was written in 1985 but didn't make \"Speak English or Die\", and I can't remember what the S.O.D. song title is, it has the same riffs but different lyrics.\n\nSome of the songs are a bit boring. \"I Am the Law\", for instance, just isn't fast enough. Same with \"The Horror of It All\", and \"One World\" has a particularly non-interesting chorus. Also, by the time you get to, say, Indians (track 6), you'll have heard most of the riffs by Caught in a Mosh (track 2) or Efilnikufesin (track 4)... so for real highlights, one has to go to either the title track, or \"A Skeleton in the Closet\", which just sound a bit different.\n\nOverall, this is a somewhat decent album, but it would take the next two albums before Anthrax really got their shit together again.\n",
        "\nThe only song that really totally must be heard on here is Armed and Dangerous, which is identical to the version of Spreading the Disease, so there really isn't much reason to get this EP. It was put out in late 1984 when Joey Belladonna first joined the band, just so the world could hear his less-shrieky-than-Turbin voice. There is another original on here, Raise Hell, which is not available anywhere else (except live on some old bootlegs) but it isn't exactly top notch. The cover of God Save the Queen is also kinda forgettable.\n\nThe last two songs on here (the re-release anyway) are with Turbin - and also with Greg D'Angelo on drums, as they are from the July 1983 Anthrax 12\" single \"Soldiers of Metal\" (produced by Ross the Boss of Manowar, for trivia freaks). \n\nThere are two live-in-studio tracks which sound pretty similar to the versions available on Fistful of Metal, other than having Joey on vocals. They are worth getting for completists, but otherwise this EP, like most other EPs, is pretty much non-essential.\n",
        "\nIt's pretty difficult to fuck up speed metal. This album is a bit generic, but for 1984 it will pass. The songs are nice and catchy, and there are really no throwaways. Neil Turbin's vocals are completely over the top, and for some people that is a negative point, but I thorougly enjoy them. \n\nThere are a few thrash moments here, but not as many as on, say Show no Mercy or Kill 'em All. Howling Furies has a nice backbone thrash riff, and Metal Thrashing Mad is pretty much borderline between speed and thrash. The rest is all-out speed metal. Some of the guitar work is totally reminiscent of Judas Priest or even Iron Maiden, especially the middle solo of the song Panic, which has a definite Let us Prey vibe. \n\nThe weakest song on here is probably the Alice Cooper cover, I'm Eighteen. It's not bad, just not blazing fast, but oh well. Highlights include the aforementioned Panic, Subjugator... \"lashing out, striking down, all those who stand in the way!\" - also Death From Above (\"jetfighter! jetfighter!\"), and the most thrashy song on here, Howling Furies, which would not look out of place on Spreading the Disease. Overall, a pretty decent album.\n",
        "\nForget all the rap-core, the big bermuda shorts, and the NOT-man. Before Anthrax started hanging their notoriety on those big hooks, they were a decent, fast power/thrash band who actually had long hair and leather jackets, and Spreading the Disease was probably their finest moment. It was their second album, but the first to feature (at the time) new vocalist Joey Belladonna, who turned in what was undoubtedly his best vocal performance with the band - melodic without getting annoying, and he didn't really overuse the high notes. The band themselves hit a high mark as well - I personally think that they never really achieved the heaviness they had on this album: the slow-groove 'mosh' parts in AIR, the blazing thrashing in Aftershock and Gung-Ho, that heavy-as-fuck opening crunch in Madhouse... This album has LOTS of great moments like that. Scott Ian's heavy-handed rhythm style was at its peak, and Frank Bello's agile bass lines really spiced things up. I've never thought Dan Spitz was that great a lead guitarist, but he was at his least annoying on this album. \n\nHot spots on the album are Armed and Dangerous (opening with some nice acoustic guitar work and melodic bass lines), Medusa (with it's infectious main riff and great lyrics and vocals), and my personal favorite, Lone Justice. Overall, though, this album is sort of like a snapshot of the state of 'just above underground' thrash metal of the time, and as such quite worth checking out.\n\n(Originally published at LARM (c) 1999)\n"
