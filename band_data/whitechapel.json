        "\nWhitechapel is undoubtedly one of the biggest bands in deathcore. Unlike most bands in the genre, they have had a fair amount of staying power and have even garnered attention from outside the genre. Classics like 'This Is Exile' and the 'Somatic Defilement' are staples of early deathcore and must-listens if you're a fan of the genre. 2019's 'The Valley' was a stylistic departure for the band by exploring deeper, more personal lyrical themes as well as an overall less aggressive sound. That album is one of my favorites from the band, especially the track, 'When a Demon Defiles a Witch'. On October 29th Whitechapel released the sequel to 'The Valley', entitled 'Kin', via Metal Blade Records.\n\nOne major thing Whitechapel did well with 'The Valley' was push the boundaries of what deathcore can be. That album is so much more than just a nonstop barrage of chugs and breakdowns. It was a very personal album for singer Phil Bozeman, since it explored his troubled childhood. 'Kin' is in much the same vein, which is fairly obvious just by looking at the cover. Sonically it feels like a logical continuation of 'The Valley' though sticks pretty close to the same formula. Everything you'd expect from Whitechapel is here, but the hatred and aggression are used much more sparingly and tactfully. There's also a softer side to Whitechapel which is a controversial subject within the deathcore community.\n\nThe inclusion of clean vocals in deathcore is a touchy subject to say the least. Phil Bozeman's clean singing is better than the vast majority of deathcore vocalists. I've always thought he sounded a bit like Corey Taylor. 'Kin' is his best clean vocal performance to date. I find the clean vocals work best when they're in close proximity with growls, like on 'I Will Find You' and 'Anticure'. The growls and accompanying chugs sound much heavier and more impactful in comparison to the clean vocals. The vocals aren't the only area where Whitechapel diversifies their sound. Unlike most deathcore bands, Whitechapel doesn't limit themselves to chugs and breakdowns and other traditional deathcore elements. They throw in some acoustic guitar and other more mellow elements that create an almost hard rock feel at times. Given that Whitechapel is from Tennessee, these sections have a bit of an American folk and some southern swagger to them. These elements have always felt like a slight influence but they're more prominent and more thoroughly explored than ever on 'Kin', primarily the tail end. \n\nThe latter half of this album is definitely more exploratory and diverse than Whitechapel has ever been. Whitechapel's more mellow side is shown off more than ever and it sounds excellent although it makes 'Kin' an oddly paced album. The first half is clearly in the same vein as 'The Valley'. Whitechapel excellently mixes and balances their traditional deathcore sound with more folky elements. The latter part of the album is weighted more heavily towards their mellow sound and, while I thoroughly enjoy this sound, it slows down the album a bit too much, largely due to the just how much is fit into one section of the album. \n\n'Kin' is another great addition to Whitechapel's discography. It's loaded with that vintage Whitechapel swagger but isn't afraid to venture outside of that sound as well. I think your enjoyment of this album is going to come down to your opinion on 'The Valley' because realistically they aren't incredibly different albums. While I find 'The Valley' to be a more condensed, cohesive package, I still thoroughly enjoyed this album. Personally, now that they've done two albums in this niche, I'm hoping they try something different next time.\n\nOriginally published on my Facebook blog: 33 RPM Chaos\n",
        "\nThe day I picked up this album and slipped it into my car's CD player, I was unprepared for what would hit my ears. I freely admit my shock at this paradigm shift of tone and style is due to the lack of attention I've paid to this band. Over the nearly decade and a half this band has been actively putting out albums, I've only sat myself down and absorbed their debut. I've never been a fan of the heavy testosterone-laden, tough guy, breakdown-laden, chug-chug-chugging, chest-thumping, arm-in-arm, bro-to-bro core-fest that is most of Whitechapel's material. I was thoroughly appreciative of the debut's take on the knife-wielding serial killer, Jack the Ripper, and his fetishistic prostitute murders, though it had more than its fair share of problems which I elucidated in my review of it here on the Archives, so feel free to eyeball that if you ever feel inclined.\n\nI'd heard through the grapevine from metal publications and review sites that the album before this, The Valley, was something of a gravitational shift in direction. The band had gone towards a more intimate, personal sway that was penned by Phil Bozeman, the band's founder and lead vocalist, focusing much more directly on his troubled childhood, personal struggles and tragedies throughout his life. The lyrics reflected this as did the musical style, shifting away from the previous style of their older albums and into territory that spoke more to melodicism within a more subdued, almost airier form of deathcore. In fairness, this description I'm giving may be missing the mark altogether because I never got the chance to listen to The Valley. I'd heard great things about it and I don't doubt the tonal shift which led to the increased attention was probably what led me to getting their newest album right here.\n\n\"A more subdued form of deathcore.\" Now how does that makes sense? Deathcore's aural palate is all about very pronounced, down-tuned guitars, crushing breakdowns, explosive bass that makes the speakers rattle and, generally, simplistic songwriting that's more open-ended and more niche than pure death metal. One is specifically targeted for metalheads while the other includes the scene and radio crowd. It goes against the previous charge of this band toning it down a bit. As I said before, this band was a band I ignored beyond their first album. My attention was focused on other deathcore bands like Carnifex and Job for a Cowboy. Speaking of, all of these bands all have one major thing in common: the paradigm shift. Carnifex changed lanes a couple times throughout their career, swapping between blackened deathcore and death metal-styled deathcore. Job for a Cowboy went more extreme and violently mutated into a full-on technical and, in the case of their latest album, progressive death metal beast. Whitechapel has done the same and, by no measure, is it a bad thing. If I can be honest, it's a wonderful change that I'm willing to embrace without question.\n\nGone are the deep, rumbling guitars as they're replaced with much gentler sounding guitars. Somber acoustic passages that exude a dismal, sad, forlorn atmosphere are found in just about every song. These parts are beautiful and do a wonderful job contrasting the much more heavier, distorted parts that pair them in these songs. Songs like the opening \"I Will Find You\" and \"Anticure\" later on are great examples of creating that longing feeling the band gives to the listener with this canyon-wide contrast. There's a ton of clean singing on this album, way more than I expected (I'll be honest, I didn't expect any since this is a deathcore album, after all) and, while I was turned off by it at first listen given the abundance of it on almost every song, they began to grow on my after the second full listen and I was sold on them by the third listen. Bozeman proves himself to be very talented with his clean singing voice. In fact, I'm not ashamed to admit that \"Orphan\" drove me to tears when I heard it the first time. It fell entirely on Bozeman's very moving vocals and personal lyrics that seemed to speak to me on an emotional level that doesn't happen much beyond a few bands and artists like Devin Townsend and Volbeat, for example, whose lyrics are very introspective and personal. Any album that can makes me cry upon first listen has done something incredibly, incredibly right.\n\nContinuing with the songwriting, I want to dissect it a little more. I've already mentioned the body, the rhythm guitars. Let's talk about the muscles and the tendons and the rest of the inner workings that structure it. Like I said before, the majority of these songs have acoustic sections or, if not acoustic parts that open or close each song out, guitars that don't ring or rumble quite as loud as you'd think if you're more familiar with their other stuff. Fret not, though, for it's not all mellow, easy listening because the songwriting does allow for a more no-holds-barred approach. \"A Bloodsoaked Symphony,\" for example, probably sticks closest to the typical deathcore formula. It's got much more of the songwriting that typifies that style in its drumming and chugging. Same applies to \"Lost Boy,\" which has some of the most intense drumming on the record. \"To the Wolves,\" in particular, dives all but headfirst into melodic death metal territory. It slithers with shades of DevilDriver to these ears with a solo that drives home the melodicism and technicality that reminds me even more of DD. Speaking of the solos, they're pretty spaced out and don't take up much of the running time as every other song contains one solo that, once more, sounds about as far from TSD and Exile-era Whitechapel as earthly possible. I'm not particularly chafed about this. In truth, I've never been the biggest stickler with guitar solos, though I do appreciate a good guitar solo when I hear it. The drums and the bass also lean more towards a much more subdued timbre, getting fully reclusive sometimes. The instrumental interlude, \"Without You,\" is the most prime example because they're completely nonexistent there. Yet another example, also incredibly prominent, of the vicious shift in tone that I pinpointed towards the beginning, is the title track that closes the album. This is an almost entirely acoustic piece with one half running with that, while the other half runs to the finish line with full-blown melodic death metal leanings.\n\nI could go and praise this album all day long but, lo, it's not a perfect record. There are a few gripes I have. For one, while I do think the pacing of the album is wonderful, the end, once \"Orphan\" hits, is where the album runs out of steam with its heaviness and goes entirely soft on the listener with little in the way of crushing moments. I understand the concept and narrative of this album would, by its nature, lead to different songwriting structures needing to be yielded to to accommodate the emotional peaks and valleys this album takes the listener on but, the last four tracks are really kind of hit a stride of being quite radio-friendly. Also, I don't particularly care for Bozeman's roughs here. He seems to have lately fallen into the CJ McMahon pothole of only having one mid-ranged growl to work with and it gets very tiring to hear just that octave being belched out. Occasionally amidst the middle-of-the-road growling rabble, some higher pitched screams are peppered in to serve as the typical double-tracked vocal affair often heard in just about every genre of metal under the boiling sun and it's just as tiresome here as it is there.\n\nWhen all is said and done, the personal purging of Bozeman's demons continues with this album and it's a journey worth taking. Kin has a few bumps along the way, a few brown patches that might spoil the experience a touch but, nothing that's ultimately a deal breaker rears its ugly head. This album, all in all, is fantastic and I'm pleasantly surprised with it. Here's hoping this new direction continues to inspire more amazing musical manifestations like this.\n\n\nRECOMMENDED TRACKS:\n\n\"I Will Find You\"\n\"Anticure\"\n\"To the Wolves\"\n\"History Is Silent\"\n\"Orphan\"\n",
        "\nIt is all but inevitable that with the passage of time a given style subset within music will become more expansive; not necessarily losing what it was in the beginning of its run, but coming out as significantly different all the same. Arguably the most curious developments of late within the ever evolving world of modern metal has been the various twists and turns occurring among the prime movers of the mid-2000s deathcore craze. While subsequent lineup changes coincided with Arizona\u2019s Job For A Cowboy moving towards a more progressive death metal template and Californian trustees of the same scene Carnifex have taken to a blackened symphonic take on their craft, Tennessee-based trailblazers Whitechapel have been treading a more nuanced and less bombastic path. Particularly with the recent advent of 2019\u2019s The Valley, front man Phil Bozeman has taken to a confessional, autobiographical mode of lyric composition, with his band mates following suit with a more stylistically varied and atmospherically rich take on things.\n\nIn every respect, this six-piece\u2019s latest studio venture Kin is a sequel to its aforementioned predecessor, further building upon the dual road of ravaging harshness that defined their earliest albums and a melancholy, almost folksy acoustic counterpoint that has come about more recently. Bozeman, who vacillates between his signature ultra-guttural barking sound and his almost pop-infused squeaky clean croon, plays the part of narrator to a story that parallels the confessional flavor of The Valley, but moves into more of a fictitious \u201cwhat if\u201d storyline that brings in an element of cosmic horror. The resulting plotline can be summed up as an alternate world where every choice made by Phil himself is the wrong one, leading his fictitious twin for which the album is named to a state of ruin not all that different from the nightmare scenarios that frequently accompany a proper extreme metal experience. The surrounding music proves mostly effective in tying this dark, partly supernatural story together, though at times it seems to meander a bit, unwilling to fully commit to a dissonant storm of aggression during its rougher points and often drifting into ephemeral atmospheric moments.\n\nThis conceptual work makes its structural nature known fairly blatantly from its very onset, though as it progresses the delineation of each chapter becomes a bit more nebulous. The opening foray \u201cI Will Find You\u201d introduces things on a fairly lofty and epic note, intermingling some tuneful acoustic work reminiscent of In Flames with a rage-filled thrashing element that merges the kinetic feel of bands like The Crown and Arch Enemy in with their more bottom-heavy, breakdown prone riffing style. It comes off as more of a melodic death metal affair with some danker moments, complete with a flashy guitar solo that channels the idiomatic approach of Michael Amott, and sets a more nuanced tone for the rest of the album. Other offerings from this collection such as \u201cA Bloodsoaked Symphony\u201d and \u201cWithout Us\u201d cut their gloomy atmospheric balladry with a chunkier, slow-paced, almost djent-like stomp that is no less aggressive than the more thrashing material found here.\n\nThen again, there are some songs to be found on here that stick to a more consistent set of expressions, though still differing from each other to the point of making for a highly mixed up experience when taking the album as a whole. Among the more chaotic offerings rounding out the bunch stands the blast-happy crusher \u201cLost Boy\u201d (which does veer into a spacey, melodic passage for a time but is mostly impact-based) and it\u2019s more consistently extreme cousin \u201cTo The Wolves\u201d, which sounds the closest to an overt throwback to the intensity of The Somatic Defilement and This Is Exile. By contrast, the power balladry of \u201cHistory Is Silent\u201d and the wholly melodic and mellow ballad \u201cOrphan\u201d listen closer to the woeful spirit that typified the typical Nevermore ballad, albeit with a more pronounced contrast between Phil\u2019s clean passages and his occasional reversions back to a growling, ravenous bear. There\u2019s even a brief instrumental passage with plenty of light textured acoustic noodling in \u201cWithout You\u201d for any who prefer the softer side of newer Whitechapel.\n\nAs with any album that ties itself to a singular story narrative, the lynchpin is the degree of clarity by which the tale is delivered, and the music proves adaptive enough to convey the wide array of negative emotions and dark imagery tied to the album\u2019s concept. However, when taken apart from its highly confessional and personal nature and treated as any other album in the deathcore style, it comes off as a little disorganized. The abruptness by which most of the cleaner passages take over for the barrage of angry riffs and shouts, along with the vocal work accompanying the softer points sounding a tad over-processed, proves to be its Persian Flaw. At this juncture it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that Whitechapel has moved beyond the consistently hateful and raw sonic blend of the mid-2000s and any older fans that dropped off as a result will likely not be roped in by this, but the current fan base will find a mostly solid blend of extremes that is slightly more forceful and complex than The Valley, but also a little less focused and clearly tied together.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nAs Whitechapel has slowly transformed from a mid-tier deathcore band into a shit-tier deathcore/nu-metal band with commercial trappings, it's only natural that they take on one of the least desirable characteristics of commercial music: the generic sentimental ballad. The original version of this song (your standard modern formulaic alternative rock piece) wasn't good, and this re-make doesn't improve on the original any, even though it might seem that the softest, most accessible track from an album would make the smoothest transformation into an acoustic piece.\n\nI'll give Whitechapel credit: they managed to make this version a bit interesting by changing the guitar melodies a bit to make it sound like it's more suited to the range of an acoustic guitar rather than electric 7-strings. Hickory Creek has transformed from a light verse/heavy chorus alternative rock ballad into a \"douchebag with a guitar\" song (e.g. Wonderwall or Hey There Delilah), but it's a decent douchebag with a guitar song. There's some somber canned strings that come in later on in the song that lend themselves well to the song's image of loss and hurt, but that's about where the good things about the music end. The arrangement is still a radio rock formula, and the best part of the original song - the finger-style acoustic guitar melody at the very end - has been omitted. \n\nWhether in acoustic or plugged-in form, this song is a laughable attempt at an emotional theme. With a heavily processed clean voice, breaths into the microphone, and annoying vocal fry accents at the beginning of lines, Phil Bozeman sings the same lyrics from the original, with some slight variations on the original melody. The lyrics are just bad - high school angsty pseudo-poetry in the style of Three Days Grace and modern In Flames. I'll let a few lines from the song speak for themselves:\n\n\"It's so hard to let go...\"\n\"I left so long ago, you never noticed I was gone...\"\n\"For what it's worth, you're still beautiful...\"\n\"I'm fading faster now...\"\n\"You can hear me but I'm invisible...\"\n\nThrowing all the most cliched emotional themes together with slight variations didn't work well, but what did you expect from a band who has delivered such lyrical delights in the past as \"Fucked and left for dead\" and \"You, you are nothing, we are everything\"?\n\nHere is the best use of this song that I can think of: learn it on acoustic guitar, sit around the campfire with your friends, and sing it to the night. If I was able to make someone cry once by singing Breaking Benjamin's \"Dear Agony\", then people must exist who would get some emotional response from this song's poorly contrived emotion - no matter which version they listen to.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s insane how a deathcore band would manage to compose a beautiful acoustic work, but I wouldn't expect this from anyone other than Whitechapel. With the amount of emotions invested from such a personal record in The Valley, you can only make it sound even calmer but sad as well. That\u2019s the nature of the song. The original is arguably their finest song, but the acoustic version adds more depth and gives a unique perspective, something anyone can listen.\n\nThe rhythm from the acoustic guitar sounds simple enough to hit you where it needs, while you have strings in the background, adding, filling, and broadening more layers to the acoustic composition. Of course, the best part is Phil\u2019s clean vocals. Despite his demeanor in the way he lets out the words with his clean vocals, he sounds soothing. Sometimes, there\u2019s no need for electricity to create a masterpiece.\n",
        "\nTo be honest, I have not seen this coming! I liked the predecessor \"Mark of the Blade\" alot, but it worked more or less as some sort of a transition album for Whitechapel's sound, and was a strong album but nonetheless the weakest entry in their discography. Now here is \"The Valley\" and it kills everything that stands in its way! \n\nDeathcore is a hated term when it comes to heavy music, but I must admit that this label does not work that well anymore in the case of Whitechapel. The deathcore is still present but I can't get rid myself off the feeling that the death metal influences takes more and more room to breathe. Although it sounds clearly like Whitechapel in its purest form everything feels more authentic and true in a way I cannot describe as well as I wanted it to do. Due to the more emotional and authentical feeling this album creates, \"The Valley\" is a big step up from every previous work of the band. It is not that these things were missing on all albums prior to \"The Valley\", but never before Whitechapel reached such a high level to create this sheer brutal intensity. Even when the song itself lacks instrumental brutality everything seems darker than black coffee just because of this authenticity.\n\nAt the first glance \"The Valley\" seems like a logical continuation of \"Mark of the Blade\", just way more mature and focused than its predecessor. \"Mark of the Blade\", though a cool album, was nonetheless a mess by Whitechapel standards. Although I enjoy this album for its fun factor, I felt like it was going nowhere, it felt like it wanted to be more modern, progressive and something completely new at the same time but falls flat in terms of songwriting. The ideas, the vision and the will was there but the implementation failed. As mentioned before it serves as a transitional album more or less. One might think \"Oh my fucking God, if \"Mark of the Blade\" was just a transition album, where does \"The Valley\" take us? Three words: into the depths! Into the depths of Phil Bozeman's emotional pain, to be more precise. The divine pig imitator that is Bozeman processes his entire past lyrically, wraps his lyrical outpourings in wonderfully cryptic to subtly direct phrases that you are compelled to sympathize with. And yes, this also has a purifying effect on the listener because \"The Valley\" is brimming with authenticity and therefore seems genuine and honest. Funny Fact: At the time I wrote these lines, for a second I thought the perfect fitting title for the album were \"Through the Valley of the Shadow of Bozeman\", or \"The Valley of Truth\". Musically \"The Valley\" is the direct continuation of \"Mark of the Blade\", just way more darker, focused and in small parts even back-to-the-roots. \n\nThe opener \"When a Demon Defiles a Witch\" is breathtakingly beautiful. The contained clear vocals no longer appear to be out of place, instead they now fit perfectly into the sound. This does not detract the heaviness of the music, it offers a wide range of emotions and completely sweeps the listener into the depths of the pain of a tortured soul. To speak of the vocals, \"Hickory Creek\" consists entirely of clean vocals and is very melodic, a catchy tune and probably the most unusual song of their discography to date. The fascinating thing about \"Hickory Creek\" is that despite its different nature it does not feel like a foreign body and fits perfectly into the album's flow. To be honest, if Whitechapel is able to compose at least one song of this size on every new album every now and then, they could completely transform their sound into sad gothic rock, and I would be pleased with it. \"Third Depth\" is such a candidate for a near perfect fusion of melancholic gothicness and death metal, cinematic as fuck. Great!\n\nAlthough they've got more melodical in some ways they never forgot to implement the sheer brutality and never loses the groove. For example: \"Black Bear\" has a great main riff that will rip your head off and will stay in your ears for quite a long while, \"Brimstone\" on the other hand reminds shamelessly on the \"This Is Exile\" times with its slow motion riffs and slamming moments. My favourite track here is indeed \"Forgiveness Is Weakness\", it is a pleasure to dwell in this brutal song for near three minutes and feel how much liberating anger such music can create if it is just true enough to grip your deepest desire to grind everything down into the ground. You cannot imagine how liberating it feels to me, everytime Phil grunts the phrase \"We all know you're going to Hell, come back to life and I'll send you myself! Dig the casket from the dirt, you don't\u00a0deserve to be one with the earth\", the sheer anger sends shivers down my spine. \"Doom Woods\" closes the album, and honor its name perfectly. Its haunting atmosphere and slow istrumentation makes me feel like I am standing in a dark forest midst dead trees, hunted by wolves. The melancholy will break your heart and gets more intensive with every passing minute. \n\nSo I hope that this album cleansed Phil Bozeman's soul and helped him to get over some things that happened to him in the past, the rest of the band had created a grand musical of brutal and breathtakingly tunes that fits the lyrics perfectly. If you search for music that will touch you, then get this album and have a entrance pass into the deepest valley of a tortured soul and walk a dark but entertaining and honest path with Whitechapel. Thank you for your time, my friend.\n",
        "\nI've done a single Whitechapel review for MA before this one and in that previous review I mentioned that was really more or less my only real experience with the band. Luckily for all of us I'm much more familiar with them at the time of this review, and this I must humbly say I consider to be their best thus far.\n\nPrevious Whitechapel albums have sounds that might go without saying, The Somatic Defilement and This Is Exile are classics in the deathcore scene. Albums beyond that become at tad more diverse, first exploring groove metal riffs, then djenty touches and acoustic sections then landing us here at The Valley. The Valley has many clear cut qualities that land it in the sonic territories of deathcore, it has many sections that break this mold completely. For example, Hickory Creek is not a deathcore song, its not even close. The first verse consisting of clean guitars and vocals with a distorted guitar style creeping in fairly briefly on the choruses that only descends into a heavier style late into the song. I don't want to use the term radio rock as an insult here, on the contrary I think this song is great, but this is diametrically opposed to the sound of This Is Exile and is well, closer to the hard rock styling one might hear on the radio. Its hard to think of the opening track as deathcore either when its totally devoid of a breakdown, opting to replace it with a soft clean sung passage and furious guitar solo where the breakdown would normally be found.\n\nSure, another cut off of here is Forgiveness is Weakness (or Brimstone which immediately follows) which couldn't be more typical deathcore if it tried, its got the same chuggy styled riff and the same predictably timed breakdown, but there is legitimate artistic growth in this band. Perhaps that's not much to brag about given how stale deathcore is, perhaps I should be more critical of how the band's step forward is into territory that's blatantly more marketable, but that criticism would be offset in the knowledge that the singer is trying to convey the story of his own personal loss, a story that is often told with a soft/hard dynamic, one only needs to glance over at acts to such as Oathbreaker or Ghost Bath to see similar tactics employed. Of course when a band has only written hard hitting chuggy music as Whitechapel has done anything approximating a softer or melodically driven sound is going to be more marketable in comparison.\n\nIn a very honest way I actually have a hard time imagining a deathcore album I could potentially enjoy more than this, I am very fond of multiple Carnifex and Shadow of Intent albums, but for all the dynamics both those bands bring to the table they do still kind of come out being generic deathcore that I just happen to enjoy a lot more than a lot of other generic deathcore, but The Valley cuts straight to the bone and addresses the biggest grievance that's often laid against the deathcore genre. This album is not generic, it does not mindlessly rehash the same stale breakdowns and chuggy riffs. It doesn't tack on vague atmospheric and melodic moments and call it a day, rather it actually takes time to really dive head first into both areas and its the better for it.\n",
        "\nSince their early The Somatic Defilement days as a run-of-the-mill (but still quite good) deathcore band, Whitechapel have accomplished a lot. Top charting albums, fans and gigs all over the world: up to the impressive yet stagnating A New Era of Corruption, the band was destined to be one of the best \"new things modern metal has to offer\"...\n\n...Until deathcore stopped being a trend! That's right: when this decade started, all those scene kids wearing Hot Topic shirts, emo haircuts and full sleeve tattoos started to fade. A lot of bands that amassed a huge amount of popularity during the glory days of the subgenre began to deteriorate. People were losing interest and were moving forward unto the new trend (Djent? Blackgaze? Whatever...).\n\nWith this end of an era happening, the popular (and not so popular) deathcore bands understood a basic premise: either they would adapt to the new times, experimenting with their musical boundaries in order to make their names part of some sort of legacy, or either they would stay the same. Of course, the second option was the less painful one: metal fans are often reluctant to change, and the heavier the subgenre they are into, the harder they complain.\n\nJob for a Cowboy became a technical death metal band with Sun Eater; Suicide Silence tried to go full nu metal with Suicide Silence, citing bands such as Korn or Deftones as clear influences; The Black Dahlia Murder left behind all little -core traits they still had with Ritual ... And I could go and on! Year after year, many are the deathcore bands that try to give new life to a genre that seems to refuse to die and, in a lot of cases, to evolve.\n\nWhitechapel decided to renovate themselves with their 2012 self-titled album Whitechapel and, in my opinion, succeeded marvelously. Not only they tried new things and brought a groovier side to their craft, but also retained their trademark heaviness, pleasing the annoying scene kids. Sadly, they couldn't keep up the pace with their next albums. Our Endless War was an uninspired release that was heavy on the hardcore elements and felt like a B-sides compilation from the previous album. Mark of the Blade followed, and while it introduced new things such as Phil Bozeman's clean singing and groovier and catchier songs, the whole album felt weak and boring. I was ready to just accept that Whitechapel had their flame gone cold, no longer being able to reinvent themselves... But then, The Valley happened.\n\nWith this release, the band has achieved a maturity and a professionalism that's very scarce on mainstream heavy metal. No only the music has an incredible quality, but also the lyrical themes and the concept that ties this album together: Bozeman's tortured childhood. I will not delve into the singer's personal life, but I just want to make clear that it is not an easy thing to open oneself like this (massive props to him). The lyrics hurt, and the amazing music helps to channel the pain effortlessly.\n\nMusically, all the elements that the band tried on previous releases are present, albeit distributed and arranged in an spectacular and satisfying way. There's blast beats, clean vocals, soaring solos, heavy grooves, brutal breakdowns... You name it. But they are cleverly used and they never feel abused. There are even some new things, such as atmospheric and almost acoustic sounding sections, sludgy riffs and even epic and ominous riffs that wouldn't be out of place on a post metal album.\n\nSongs like the stellar opener When a Demon Defiles a Witch, the heartfelt ballad Hickory Creek or the A Perfect Circle-esque Third Depth show how effortesly the band can mix a softer and almost atmospheric side with their trademark brutality. Tracks like Forgiveness Is Weakness, We Are One and Lovelace have a more classic Whitechapel nature, albeit with an incredible production and some of those new elements such as the soaring solos or almost acoustic segments. Then, there's pieces like Brimstone, The Other Side and Black Bear that introduce the groovier side of the band, with a sludge metal feel (Black Bear being closer to nu metal, with its catchy Korn inspired riffs). Closing track Doom Woods deserves a special mention: the tribal drumming and furious sludge metal riffs bring bands like Cult of Luna or Neurosis to my mind, and the powerful and gloom-laden leads (specially in the astonishing chorus) harken back to legendary acts such as Paradise Lost or Saturnus.\n\nSo, what does it sounds like? Flawless. Producer and engineer Mark Lewis does an incredible job bringing the band to the best and most professional they ever sounded. From the compositive aspect, every song has the right elements to make themselves unique and memorable. The three guitars are, once and for all, cleverly used, with a lot of sonic textures being employed to enrich the storytelling aspect of the album. The drums sounds huge and great, this being one of my favourite metal drum sounds in the recent years. Every instrument and every musician play their role in an excellent way, and the crystal clear mix adds to the overall high fidelity of the record.\n\nThe star of the album is obviously vocalist Phil Bozeman: his lyrics are real, sincere and powerful, bringing his personal story back to life. His vocal delivery also helps: be it clean vocals, deep guttural growls or violent screams, he is the driving force behind this incredible album. Again, Lewis' production really helps him shine, exceptionally using his range and layering his voice in interesting and fascinating ways.\n\nBut of course, the album has some problems: some tracks feel less developed than others, but that is because of the spectacular display of awe that most of the songs manage to transmit. I would have loved for the progressive tendencies the band is developing to be used even more: they are clearly good songwritters filled with bright ideas that are really well implemented. My only wish for the band is to keep exploring this kind of \"weirdness\", to let their experimental and adventurous side flourish, even if their long time fans are not happy with this direction.\n\nIn sum, The Valley is undoubtedly Whitechapel's strongest album to date, and one of the best to come from a \"deathcore era\" band. Extraordinary songwritting, big and heavy riffs, smartly used clean vocals and a more mature sound make this an unquestionable step in the right direction for the Knoxville sextet. The Valley is an emotional (yet brutal) journey through the darkness of a broken childhood that lets the band claim their rightful place amongst mainstream metal finest acts. They have slowly become a massive and popular band, and now with this masterpiece they can finally gain all the respect they deserve from \"the elitist ones\". \n\n(Originally published in rateyourmusic.com)\n",
        "\nWell, I guess nobody was seeing that coming. After two underwhelming and uninspired releases, Whitechapel pop out in 2019 with what is possibly their best work yet, proving wrong the ones who thought they were going to fade into the realms of generic songwriting like many other similar acts. These deathcore giants prove to be still at the top of their game, claiming back the crown of kings of a genre that has showed an interesting progression in the past few years.\n\n\"The Valley\" is a concept album concerning vocalist Phil Bozeman's tormented childhood, and it exhibits a new, more experimental side of the band, which is the natural progression of the sound they experimented with in \"Mark of the Blade\", resulting in the Tennessee's metalheads' most deep and emotional offer ever. The band's sound evolution was accompanied by an artistic maturation as well, and this is clearly evident when it comes both to the songwriting and the lyrical aspect of the CD, which are definitely the best these guys have ever penned.\n\nWith this release, Whitechapel were able to stay true to the roots of their sound, while also innovating it: indeed, while all the trademark elements of their earlier releases are still there (deep fry screams, tremolo picking, blast beats, breakdowns), the band made of variety its greatest strength, providing here and there interesting clean arpeggios that enhance the atmosphere of the record, and generally leaning towards a more groovy/atmospheric guitar and drum work. That is not to say fast bangers or heavy, chuggy tracks aren't present, just think to album opener \"When a Demon Defiles a Witch\", or to lead single \"Brimstone\": simply, there's more variety than ever before to be found, in tracks like the groovy \"Black Bear\", the atmospheric \"Doom Woods\" or the melancholic \"Hickory Creek\", the moving (and completely clean-sung!) album's ballad. \n\nAnd here we come to the second and probably most striking aspect of the album: the clean vocals. This is the first album where Phil Bozeman makes extensive use of clean singing, but fear not, as he delivers one of the best performances of his entire career. His cleans sound emotional, confident, and not whiny or cheesy even in the least, thus perfectly matching and complementing the mood of the songs where they're used, and of the album as a whole. The story narrated throughout the fourty minutes of duration of the CD is definitely sad and involves Phil directly, and the fact that he decided to use means of expressivity new to his style only enhances the whole musical product and the cohesion to the concept behind it.\n\nThe only flaw I can think of is that some songs of the second half of the album (for example, \"Lovelace\"), while still being good songs, are not as spectacular as the material found in the first half, but that's not a big lack if we consider the overall quality of the CD.\n\nLast but not at least, a brief mention goes to the excellent production, with the guitars being blessed by a thick guitar tone that absolutely pumps up the heaviest sections of the record, and a fantastic drumkit setup.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely the best offering by Whitechapel, probably even topping the already excellent \"This Is Exile\". Highly recommended to old and new fans of the group alike, or to metalheads eager to appreciate a modern and fantastically conceived concept album, making up for one of the best and most interesting releases of 2019 so far.\n\nOriginally written for: The Metal Observer.\n",
        "\nUpon listening to the singles from Whitechapel's new album \"The Valley\", it was clear that Whitechapel is not returning to the sound that they cemented with their debut \"The Somatic Defilement\" and sophomore album \"This Is Exile\". I'm sure a lot of people where hoping for that after the last two albums, which definitely were not as good as those that preceded them, though I still found enjoyment listening to. Here, Whitechapel is mainly expanding on the sound they ran with on \"Mark of the Blade\", though it seems to be even farther removed from their deathcore style. This is still a Whitechapel album though, and it certainly sounds like one, but this time around there are new ideas that the band only briefly touched upon before. It is also far more atmospheric and experimental this time around.\n\nPhil Bozeman has stated that this album is based on true events and lyrically, it can get pretty deep. \"The Valley\" can be described as a concept album based on hardships endured by Phil and his family while he was growing up. Themes tackled such as religion, neglect, and one that really sticks out being his mother's issues with drug abuse and death, really hit home on this album and you can feel the pain through the vocals. Really, this album can be somewhat described as Phil healing his wounds through lyrically potent songs and (true) storytelling. The band has definitely matured in this aspect. One thing I want to point out that may or may not be lost on a lot of listeners is the fact that there is no profanity on this album anywhere, save for \"whore\" on \"Brimstone\", which I personally don't really count as a profane word. Though I'm basically talking about the other two swears. You know what I'm talking about. Anyway, that's not a big deal but I find it interesting and shows signs of the band maturing past throwing in vulgarities into their lyrics. Vocal wise, this album is solid as ever, and Phil manages to bring the clean vocals introduced on \"Mark of the Blade\" back in a much larger quantity. \"Hickory Creek\" is an entirely cleanly sung song and it sounds really good, showing the band's atmospheric side. \"Third Depth\" is another great track with clean singing but there is so much more to be heard on the rest of the album. I believe these two songs show this side of the band better than the rest.\n\nGuitars also show more of an atmospheric influence and there is a clean intro to \"When a Demon Defiles a Witch\", the album's opener. This almost reminds me of \"Make it Bleed\" from the band's self-titled album. It's not an uncommon practice but it's cool to hear a band go from soft and mellow to outright chaos in the same song. \"Third Depth\" is similar in this way and also has a pretty cool guitar solo. There is not too much of a difference in the style of guitar playing on this album from those that have been released in the last 7 years or so, as there are some sweet solos and heavy riffs to be heard throughout the albums, but the higher use of melody and atmosphere really does bring the band to new heights as a whole. I am very interested to see where Whitechapel will go next but for now, this album is a gem and certainly corrects certain flaws that were brought up on the previous release.\n",
        "\nAbout three years after the release of Mark of the Blade, a flop of lazy composition, the band released The Valley, based on true events of the vocalist Phil Bozeman's life. This was an unexpected release, yet conceptually real. But from what I\u2019ve listened, this record doesn\u2019t offer much, other than the personal events Phil describes in his lyrics. It\u2019s still your typical Whitechapel music, but includes more clean vocals and a melodic direction.\n\nThe Valley starts with the longest-titled track When a Demon Defiles a Witch (WaDDaW). It\u2019s pretty much your typical Whitechapel sound, only with more focused clean vocals. Hickory Creek is their first-ever rock song: clean and soft, Phil singing in a rather story-telling, personal way and very little raising his voice to send the message. Third Depth\u2019s composition is amazing between the clean vocals and gutturals, showing and even enhancing Phil\u2019s vocal abilities. The song is atmospheric, sends a direct message through the lyrics and shivers down your spine. The guitar solo is too impressive. Doom Woods is a longer-composed deathcore song (not the first time from the band). It\u2019s not bad, but not fulfilling. It has a slick outro and I think if it had clean vocals, it would\u2019ve been better. And the bonus song Sea of Trees is like Fairy Fay from The Somatic Defilement (defiling enough to mention). It also sounds like something to come straight from the demos. So thanks for that!\n\nWhitechapel looked back and took inspiration from what made them unique. I believe it\u2019s the demos and debut record for the brutality, and their self-titled and the song Bring Me Home from Mark of the Blade for developed lyrics, experimentation, and clean vocals. The rest of the record is like the band\u2019s whole discography, and the chugging is far more prominent (which isn\u2019t a good thing). At least it sparks more potential like their debut record.\n\nOverall, I wasn\u2019t that impressed with this release. I was thriving for the clean vocals, and they delivered - specifically Hickory Creek and Third Depth. Nevertheless, the self-titled is still their best release. The Valley comes in second place, but you could say it\u2019s a tie between the two. At the end of the day, nothing beats their demos for the entire discography. So, well done, guys - and Phil in particular, lyrics and vocal wise!\n",
        "\nWhitechapel have fully modernized and commercialized themselves within the deathcore subgenre, with yet another garbage record (which is equivalent to All That Remains\u2018s Madness, in terms of quality). Mark of the Blade offers more or less of what the predecessor offered. This time, however, the riffs are underwhelming; Five Finger Death Punch-ish songs, chugs, and heavily inspired by the stupidity that is djent. This record is so predictable, you can easily determine its poor tracking. A single play is enough.\n\nMark of the Blade kicks off with the djenty The Void. The chugs are irritating, especially during the choruses. The title track sounds like something available from nu metal. In short, most of the record is a crappy groove metal/djent, filled with chugs and bizarre choruses. I\u2019d even say it\u2019s more metalcore with death growls (you can see where I\u2019m going with that labeling). Even the instrumental track has uninteresting melodies, guitar solos, and chugs. Most of the music is redundant. Just a huge borefest...\n\nOn the other hand, Elitist Ones struck me as a pretty decent and likeable song that sounds like something from their self-titled record. And would you look at that: Bring Me Home blends both death growls and clean vocals very well. Phil nailed it. The music is also fantastic by not shoving too many chugging. I wished that\u2019s how Whitechapel would sound. These two songs in this piece of shit record are the only worthwhile ones. Decennium also has clean vocals, but failed to sound good with the atmosphere of Five Finger Death Punch.\n\nHonestly, I can\u2019t elaborate anymore on how the record sounds. It\u2019s really repetitive when I thought the band presented a significant change. This new stupid era hardly offered anything to respect their musical direction anymore. So check out Elitist Ones and Bring Me Home for guilty pleasure. Otherwise, it feels like a point of no return. If that\u2019s the path the band chose, then it\u2019s only their loss since they can do better.\n\nNow we step a decade back. Whitechapel\u2019s demo duo are raw, heavy, vicious, scary, and simple enough to enjoy. They sound more like brutal death metal or slamming deathcore (if the latter even exists), even though I\u2019m not a fan of deathcore. I merely listen to the band because they\u2019re one of the first in the genre, or should I say pioneers, as they\u2019re the most popular. The demos are a testament to how they should\u2019ve sounded and how good they truly were, as their entire discography regressed since their debut with very few highlights. I believe they could\u2019ve become something much bigger or join the rather quality scene that is brutal death metal, as presented here. The demos are a great listen for new deathcore fans, but I would recommend listening to the aforementioned subgenre since that\u2019s where the band based their demos from.\n\nThe mix is the reason the demos is enjoyable. I can appreciate a solid, raw mix in between that makes me want to slam my desk and growl. However, it also shows the poor delivery. The songs are not too dreadful. Some have proper raw quality, others don\u2019t, and some are awful because the production wasn\u2019t delivering a proper mix, containing some sound spikes, cuts, and poor audio. Both demos have their pros and cons.\n\nI can\u2019t comment on all the instruments (not to mention how a third guitarist overshadows the bass). As I already said, it\u2019s the mix in some songs that makes them so brutal. While the band prototyped deathcore, as most of the music implies, the riffs still contain some metal in them, though they can be monotonous. If they ever wanted to use the drop A tuning properly, they should\u2019ve listened to Nile. As for Phil Bozeman\u2019s vocals, I\u2019m not too big of a fan of the shrieking and the pig-squealing parts, but they\u2019re tolerable. It\u2019s the death growls that make him sound impressive. He can growl like a bastard!\n\nThe best songs from the demos are Alone in the Morque, Articulo Mortis, Devirgination Studies, and the Demo I versions of Fairy Fay and Festering Fiesta. Prostatic Fluid and the Demo I version of Ear to Ear weren\u2019t so bad, but they\u2019re not on the same level as the other five songs. The rest of the demos and new/old versions are flawed and forgettable, from all the seven original songs (as five songs have newer versions, accumulating to twelve songs total). As for the ratings of these two conjoined releases, Mark of the Blade gets 10% and the demos get 50%. This whole release is worth 50%.\n",
        "\nI don\u2019t even know anymore... I thought they were improving and the self-titled was a stepping forward. With Our Endless War, Whitechapel became a lot more generic, blander, and commercial. I almost feel like they\u2019re trying to sell out so badly. Listening to this garbage was like listening to Lamb of God or crap with similar sound, or something solid like Dying Fetus. It\u2019s so overproduced and so forced, it\u2019s not funny...\n\nWhere to begin... all the instruments sound dreadful. To start with how the actual music sounds, it\u2019s worse than everything they\u2019ve ever made. Yes, there are more ideas for the music, even though they\u2019re temporarily heard (in the intros of Psychopathy and Diggs Road, respectively), you can't compare them to the band\u2019s self-titled. The bass - yeah, you know what? I\u2019m not going to mention the bass regarding Whitechapel anymore. Should\u2019ve just labeled yourselves as the second fucking Animals as Leaders. The drums - I can\u2019t fathom anything unique, other than Psychopathy that sounded different. Phil\u2019s vocals... it\u2019s like mixing death growls with a raspy voice; like doing very unclean vocals, or faking death growls. Perhaps unorthodox, but it sounds very pale here. I believe that\u2019s his worse vocal performance/recording. The lyrics are so disdaining, I\u2019d rather go back and listen to nu metal.\n\nWhen it comes down to the tracklist, the prelude is boring. The opening title track is really bad, clearly overproduced through the vocals. Let Me Burn, How Times Have Changed, and Blacked Out are underwhelming and typical. Songs like Mono, Worship the Digital Age (whoa, what a name, guys), Psychopathy, and Diggs Road had the potential to be good, yet that didn\u2019t end up being the case. A Process So Familiar is too hardcore; as in too awful. Fall of the Hypocrites is a wannabe slam metal song with pig squeals that sounds like Dying Fetus (again), which I\u2019m not arguing the inspiration but prefer to tune in to the originals.\n\nThe Saw Is the Law isn\u2019t considerably bad for a single. I would say it\u2019s the best song and the groove does more than enough. But you can see the lack in quality through the entire record. So Our Endless War is just as horrible as the first three records, only much more modernized and a huge letdown. Not sure what I was expecting or hoping to listen, but if that\u2019s the direction, you can count me out.\n",
        "\nWith every Whitechapel release, the band had become more and more commercial. This release isn\u2019t an exception. However, it\u2019s certainly unique. Despite aiming for success in the industry, yet still making crappy music (after listening to three other garbage records), this record delivers in creativity, change, and design I believe the band wanted. If Whitechapel continues to use the deathcore stigma, at least here they became diverse and not generic, like most other bands. Also, from other reviews I\u2019ve read, this is their best record, which isn\u2019t surprising. This backs up my earlier statement. So kudos, guys, you\u2019ve made something decent for once!\n\nThe self-titled starts and ends with a piano interlude, in the intro of Make It Bleed and in the outro of Possibilities of an Impossible Existence (with some guitars). The opening song reveals Whitechapel\u2018s dominant sound, though the music is groovier. Despite the chugging, there\u2019s more rhythm and notes. They offer more and play differently than playing roughly the same. This is how the self-titled pretty much sounds. One other note, the record isn\u2019t as extreme as its predecessors. Again, it\u2019s more commercialized and friendly that radio stations could air some songs.\n\nOne of the songs I really loved is Hate Creation. It\u2019s rather clever, to say the least, with the clean/whispering vocals; toning down the music and becoming more melodic and atmospheric. I, Dementia also gives good vibes, as well as Section 8 (with its pretty choruses), Faces, and Dead Silence. Once again, if there\u2019s something satisfying about the entire deathcore subgenre, it\u2019s the instrumental tracks. Devoid starts with a piano and later transitions into an excellent warlike music.\n\nUnfortunately, some songs are very pale. To no surprise, Make It Bleed\u2018s ending was the best part. Other songs that hardly caught my attention are  (Cult)uralist, The Night Remains, and Possibilities of an Impossible Existence. For the bonus tracks: the remixes of Breeding Violence and This Is Exile suck. The Pantera cover of Strength Beyond Strength was just as bad as the original song. The only difference is that they literally deathcored the shit out of it: chugs, death growls, and blast beats (which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing). It\u2019s almost more deathcore than some songs on this record, or should I say more \u201cextreme\u201d. Finally, the acoustic version of End of Flesh was surprisingly good, but not attractive enough (though better than the original/electric version).\n\nSo the self-titled was quite an interesting and different record to listen that felt more personal by its content. The tracks are groovier, there\u2019s more music and substance than mediocrity (yeah, still no audible bass unless I\u2019m deaf...). Overall, I liked it. Still not beating the demos for me, but the band has matured to produce originality or a new sound within deathcore. The standout songs are Hate Creation and Section 8.\n",
        "\nA New Era of Corruption\u2018s album cover looks like something off of the video game Killing Floor, or something in that fashion. Anyway... let\u2019s get down with another disappointing deathcore record, and another one for Whitechapel. This record envelopes a different sound than the last two records. It\u2019s different in terms of the music, being more riff-orientated with challenging notes and guitar solos, overall being groovy. The acoustic guitars in some parts throughout the record were a nice touch and choice in deathcore.\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s much better than the one-dimensional debut record and the predecessor This Is Exile. Having Chino Moreno featured in Reprogrammed to Hate was pretty sick! The Darkest Day of Man, Unnerving (which I think is a standout song, giving the horror-like melodies from the keyboards), Murder Sermon (featuring Vincent Bennett from The Acacia Strain), Single File to Dehumanization, and the bonus song Animus are all decent.\n\nSo what\u2019s so bad about this third installment? Well, it\u2019s floppier than before. Even one of the best screamers alive who\u2019s not exactly a metalhead couldn\u2019t save this garbage, and his addition wasn\u2019t as powerful as the shrieking of Phil Bozeman\u2019s. Obviously, the bass is hardly audible and the drums aren\u2019t anything special. The same goes for the vocals. As I already said, I do see the difference in each song; an untypical deathcore music. It\u2019s there, all right. However, they all still don\u2019t make Whitechapel an exciting listen. I don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t given up yet, even when this record is entirely distinctive. It\u2019s still mediocre and predictable. It\u2019s quite hard to even elaborate on what makes it such a boring listen...\n\nWhen people say extreme metal isn\u2019t for everyone, they\u2019re right. Deathcore concurs with that idea, too, though I would argue it\u2019s because the musical aspect is of sheer boredom. In conclusion: Reprogrammed to Hate had the potential to be a great single, but failed and overshadowed Chino\u2019s vocals. Not the best featuring I\u2019ve listened. Same goes for Murder Sermon (not that I cared for that one as much). The rest of the unmentioned songs suck, and the best one is Single File to Dehumanization, out of the aforementioned four.\n",
        "\nThis Is Exile delivers a more developed music within the deathcore subgenre. The production has better quality; the music is catchy and somewhat melodic/technical than their debut - or, in other words, likeable. More rhythm and proper palm-muted riffs, fewer chugs than before, and decent guitar solos. The lyrics now aim towards general situations in life that don\u2019t necessarily sound depressing or personal. They sing more objectively, not from personal experiences (Eternal Refuge being the exception of having too many pointless fucks in the lyrics). Unlike their debut, which was a flop in both concept and execution, the band immediately dropped the subject/s about their name and from where they adopted it.\n\nThe record isn\u2019t repetitive for the most part. The instrumental tracks are awesome, as a handful number of songs. There\u2019s more description behind the concept and the music. The first two songs and Messiahbolical (interesting metaphor) showcase said melodic/technical side of the music and structure. The title track explicitly sounds different in almost every part of it. Possession has a pretty industrial/keyboarded outro at the end. Death Becomes Him is the prime example for the best thing in deathcore: the instrumentals. Of Legions was more industrial and offered nothing unique for an instrumental track. And much like the first song, To All That Are Dead is rather groovy; justifying the record\u2019s catchiness.\n\nThe bad things I encountered are the sound and direction. For the sound, there are even more stupid breakdowns and still having three guitarists, trying to become the Iron Maiden of extreme metal without realizing they\u2019re overwhelming the sound. The rest of the songs are bland and typical. Messiahbolical is pointlessly longer than it should, and most of the songs don\u2019t distinguish, judging by their length. For the direction, This Is Exile is commercial and boosted the band\u2019s reputation at hitting mainstream whilst commercializing the genre.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest. Extreme metal shouldn\u2019t be popular. It\u2019s meant to characterize a distinct form of art through music. Music shouldn\u2019t be about business, it should be about art. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t even call deathcore extreme metal, let alone art. It\u2019s probably the highest of what \u2018core\u2019 fans would listen to and won\u2019t try to be open-minded to different genres within extreme metal. Yeah, sure, I may sound like an elitist, but I prefer quality over quantity, and Whitechapel produces the same quantity of shitty material.\n\nSo that\u2019s why This Is Exile is unfavorably catchy. It seems like the band had all the tools to make a great and distinctive record (as the tracks that I\u2019ve mentioned above helped in delivering the ideas and art). However, they made an incompetent and disappointing one instead. They weren\u2019t utilizing the full potential that some tracks described. The title track is the best song on the record simply because it delivered, and Death Becomes Him is a good track without the need of vocals.\n",
        "\nWhitechapel\u2019s The Somatic Defilement reintroduces the same seven original songs from their two demos, paired with two extra original songs and a pointless prelude. The prelude is thirty-five seconds of background samples, narration, and a bit of blast beats. Why not record an interesting prelude for more substance and expand the concept? The longest song (the title track) is the most experimental one. In advance to being the longest which is uncommon in deathcore, it sounds different in a way the band was trying to develop a new sound. Admitting they did since there are some guitar melodies, it failed compared to what the demos offered in the past. Vicer Exciser (whatever that means) offers nothing new.\n\nAs for the rest of the songs, it\u2019s sad how a bunch of demos can contemplate to a better quality of music - ironically sounding worse than this record. The vocals are as expected: death growls, pig squeals, and shrieks. The guitars are simplistic, predictable, and unoriginal, while the bass is... sorry - I guess the third guitarist needs the special shout-out. They all play the same freaking notes. The drums don\u2019t sound remarkable or attractive. All this performance makes the demos better by miles.\n\nThe only song that I found great was Fairy Fay. It sounds just as good as the Demo I\u2018s version, only cleaner. Everything else the demos cast a shadow on. For the musical aspect, everything sounds mediocre and not an ounce of something unique, even though, again, they tried with the title track. With the potential direction of brutal death metal, they flushed it down the toilet as they perfected their deathcore direction.\n",
        "\nWhitechapel have made their mark on metal for the past 14 years and in that time they've managed to become heavyweights in the controversial extreme metal genre known as deathcore. While many see the genre as innovative, some define it as a plague. Regardless, Whitechapel are certainly a force to be reckoned with. Their early material, along with the early works of Carnifex, Job for a Cowboy, and many others; helped create a micro genre of fast, abrasive, and brutal deathcore that takes much influence from brutal death metal bands such as Internal Bleeding and Suffocation. \n\nHowever, in the recent years the band has shifted their sound to a much less aggressive style of extreme metal. While still deathcore at heart, the band began to experiment with elements of progressive metal and djent on albums like Mark of the Blade which received much backlash from fans due to Whitechapel not only going in this softer direction, but also incorporating clean singing into the mix. I myself was one of the many that felt Mark of the Blade was a step in the completely wrong direction, and that opinion still stands. The mixing on that album was overproduced and the experimentation didn't quite land the punch that it could have.\n\nSo, with all of that being said, Whitechapel have returned after nearly three years to deliver a new album. The Valley is not only a return to form (for the most part) for the band, but fixes all the problems I had with Mark of the Blade. \n\nStarting off from the first track \"When a Demon Defiles a Witch\", the band show the world that they can make some damn heavy deathcore. Right from the start of the track, you get introduced to a short acoustic section which immediately branches off into some very fast and aggressive drum and guitar work. And lucky for myself and many, this isn't the only time this happens. Throughout the tracklist it varies between experimenting with progressive metal, fast and chaotic death metal, and even elements of sludge metal on songs like \"Lovelace\".\n\nThe guitar work on the album switches abruptly from tremelo riffs to palm muted riffs to soft acoustic work and then right back into the chaos. Songs like \"When a Demon Defiles a Witch\" and \"Third Depth\" showcase this switching very well and doesn't make the songs feel awkward. Now deathcore is a genre known for leaving out bass work a lot, but I can safely say that the bass is VERY audible and sounds as about as gross as a swamp. The instrumentation is heavy, sludgy, beautiful, and blissful all at the same time.\n\nPhil Bozeman comes back to form once again on the vocals. He makes heavy use of bringing back some nasty gutturals found on the early albums like The Somatic Defilement, while also introducing new techniques found on Mark of the Blade that have been fixed. There is a lot of clean singing on this album, but the problem many initially had with it was that it sounded too reminiscent of Phil Anselmo, and not in a good way. However, the clean singing on this album is fine-tuned to sound a lot more unique and atmospheric. This aspect compliments the album's personal concept very well, and reminds me a lot of something Chad Grey might've done on an old Mudvayne release or even something from Cattle Decapitation's own Travis Ryan. \n\nFinally, everything piled together along with some solid production work from Mark Lewis makes this the best Whitechapel album in probably the last 9 or so years. Everything that was a problem for me listening to the last couple albums was refined on this album, along with a very nice return to form to albums like The Somatic Defilement and This Is Exile. If you're looking for some Whitechapel that gives homage to the old and embraces the new in an exciting way, I recommend The Valley to come into your life.\n\nFinal score: 90/100.\n",
        "\nDeathcore is a genre that gets a lot of hate, and sometimes for a good reason, but there are some bands that really deserve the fame and the prase they get, and one of them is definitely Whitechapel. These guys hailing from Knoxville, Tennessee, have been able to craft some really interesting and technical music, and \"This Is Exile\" is their most famous effort, and also one of their best.\nWhitechapel understood that being brutal doesn't mean you have to sacrifice variety and memorability during the songwriting process. Thus, they created an album that is technical, extremely heavy, and almost entirely non-melodic, well, actually with just a few melodies scattered here and there (see, for example, some melodic riffs in \"Father Of Lies\" or the title track \"This Is Exile\"). \n\nThe guitar department sees a duo of Drop-A tuned, seven-strings axes providing a complex and varied performance. The riffs played can be either tremolo-picked, chord based, or palm muted; there is a wide use of tritones, especially during the breakdowns, that are rhytmically complex, well-studied and perfectly integrated with the music (they don't sound annoying or out of place as in some other deathcore albums). The solos can be present, depending on the songs, when they are performed they prove to be memorable and well-written, just think to album opener's \"Father Of Lies\" solo. Vocalist Phil Bozeman is a beast, he can reach incredibly low gutturals and high open throat screams as well, he can sing complex vocal lines, that often require a good diction and a rock-solid breathing technique due to the close succession of rapidly-spoken words. Vocals are overlayered and there are double voices as well, but still you can tell Phil is a really good vocalist, blessed with some serious skill and talent. \n\nThe drumming is tight, the songs include a lot of tempo changes and are really complex and intricate at times, but still the drummer is able to keep the pace without any problem, he can perform ferocious blast beat sessions and precise double bass drumming, he can complement the songs with interesting fills, resulting technical but not over the top. The production is really good, polished, distorted guitars with great tones, top notch vocals, the only thing that seriously disturbs me is the fact that the bass is inaudible, a problem common to most of the deathcore genre.\n\nThe songs are all good stuff, complex, intricate, technical. However, some really stand as the album's highlights. \"Father Of Lies\" starts off the album at full power, with its ferocious drumming, fast pace, great soloing and riffing, some melodic tremolo picking, and its catchy chorus and vocal line. Title track \"This Is Exile\" includes some really awesome (and heavy!) breakdowns, complex drumming, memorable and catchy vocal lines, technical riffing (spot on the tremolo picking session at the beginning, the usage of tritones and of octave chords), and an epic climax towards the ending. \"Somatically Incorrect\" begins in medias res with a brutal breakdown, while \"Daemon (The Procreated)\" includes an awesome black-metalish main riff, sounding really evil and haunting. The final track, \"Messiahbolical\", is the longest and most complex, probably even the most epic, and it is distinguished by some catchy choral arrangements complementing the growled vocal lines. There are even a pair of instrumentals serving as intros, respectively, to \"Daemon (The Procreated)\" and \"Messiahbolical\", they're not bad but they don't add anything to the listening experience.\n\nWell, this is the kind of albums that makes deathcore a genre worth listening to. It's not something that will be remembered as a legendary opus or a timeless classic, but it's a genuinely good, solid effort, which makes of quality and consistency its main points of strength. A pleasant listen if you like extreme music, without doubt!\n",
        "\n\u201cSend the slut back to Hell!\u201d\n\nNo matter how many times I hear that line, it never clicks as something that's supposed to be badass or threatening or scary. It just sounds stupid. You can't make something that simple sound anything other than over-the-top childish posturing for kids who think they're somehow mature. These words come from the second song on this album (or third if you really want to count the intro \u201cNecroticizing\u201d as a track) \u201cDevirgination Studies.\u201d Lines like this are scattered throughout this thing. Trust me, you won't be able to stifle laughter for long when they rear their ugly heads. Quite frankly, that's my biggest complaint with this album, so let's talk about how a fantastic concept that's so ripe for any fringe of metal to extract and stretch out into a full album tripped and fell somewhere along the way.\n\nIf you're reading this review, more than likely you're a fan of deathcore and you already know who Whitechapel are. I'm not totally familiar with the Tennessee five piece's music as I'm not the biggest fan of deathcore myself. There are a few bands I enjoy, but those bands typically have more of a traditional leaning towards death metal or other genres within their music (e.g. Carnifex, All Shall Perish, Thy Art Is Murder). I never gave their music a fair try until a few years ago when I sampled a song from their, at the time, newest record, which I think was Our Endless War. The song was one of the album singles, \u201cThe Saw is the Law.\" Long story short, I did not like what I heard. I didn't like the try-hard tough guy lyrics, I didn't like the vocal performance, I despised the very predictable drumming, and I loathed the uninspired riffing. I was thinking to myself, \u201cWhy do these guys need three guitarists all doing the same damn thing?\u201d If there was no variation in the guitar playing, why bother? Just have one. It's not like you're Dream Theater or any other number of progressive metal or djent bands. You're a deathcore band. Your music is nowhere near complex enough to need three guitarists.\n\nMoving on to the concept. The concept of Whitechapel's 2007 debut is simple, but somewhat unique. This album takes place entirely from the first person POV of infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper. For those who are unaware (if you're a fan of metal, you really shouldn't be), Jack the Ripper was a man who brutally murdered and disfigured several prostitutes in the poverty stricken Whitechapel district of London. He was never caught by the police, but he did purportedly leave deliberate clues for law enforcement, in which he mocked and taunted them viciously for not being able to catch him. Now I don't know about you, but the Jack the Ripper story would undoubtedly make the perfect concept album for the right band. Was Whitechapel the band to embellish this concept into a winning album?\n\nSadly, no...\n\n\u201cFucked and left for dead!\u201d\n\nTo be totally fair to the Tennessee boys, this isn't a terrible album by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, this is probably the best album of theirs since apparently every album after this one suffered a significant drop in quality one after the other. Like almost any album, even with the bad ones, it has its moments that are really worth it like the rip roaring opening to \u201cAlone In the Morgue\u201d or the melodic and symphonic ending to the title track. Now these individual moments could almost make the album worth it if it was in any way consistent. But sadly, for every really solid moment like this, there are at least three or four other problems that seem to crop up to overshadow these little glimpses of goodness. \n\n\u201cThis is war!\u201d\n\nFirst thing, breakdowns galore. Now I have no problem with breakdowns in music as long as they're done tastefully, are able to be distinguished from song to song, and they serve their purpose: to transition to the next part of a song via a sped-up riff, a really heavy bass drop, a change up in the riffing, a drum pattern, or whatever have you. If you want an example of how to do breakdowns really well, may I point to Lamb of God's second album (and their third overall as a musical group), As the Palaces Burn. This album shows how to do breakdowns in the best way without them saturating the rest of the music and having a great sense of variety. One of this record's biggest pitfalls, and a problem that plagues lots of deathcore and metalcore bands and albums, is its heavy over reliance on breakdowns. Every single song has a breakdown in it. On its own, that's a problem because it shows that the band doesn't know how to make interesting and memorable song progressions, but it gets even worse because every breakdown sounds either similar or the same. With the exception of a song like the title track, every breakdown in very predictable. You know when it's coming and when it does finally show, you'll either groan in frustration or laugh because of how out of place it is.\n\nAnother thing that I have an issue with is the vocal performance of Phil Bozeman and the lyrics. The lyrics themselves are very hit or miss and they miss more often than they hit. The concept in and of itself is about Jack the Ripper, but the lyrical interpretations read more like some random tough guy trying to pose as Jack the Ripper. Listen to some of these lyrics:\n\n\u201cI ripped her limb from fucking limb,\nJust one less slut to walk this fucking Earth,\nI will spit right in your fucking face,\nHow does it taste after your lips are sewed beneath your waist?\nYou will never fuck again!\u201d\n--Track 9, \u201cVicer Exciser\u201d\n\nHere's another:\n\n\u201cDon't fuck up the process,\nIt won't be much longer until you die,\nJust let me have my fun and I will let you die in peace,\nOh, wait, I lied.\nFalse hope is my new trend.\u201d\n\u2013Track 5, \u201cFairy Fay\u201d\n\nIt doesn't give the impression that you're in the shoes of the infamous serial killer. I understand very much that Jack was described as being very smug and sure of himself by authorities and witnesses, but these kinds of lyrics are childish and don't feel disgusting, sick, or disturbing. They're laughable and painful. There's only a few lyrics I remember reading that were of any merit to me and those were in the songs \u201cAlone in the Morgue\u201d and the title track. When it comes to the delivery of these lyrics, Phil Bozeman, the frontman and sole vocalist for Whitechapel, annoys me. He's not the worst vocalist I've ever heard, but he's surely not the best. He enunciates his words somewhat clearly when he growls and screams, and he has a really prominent register that you can feel in your gut when he hits those deep, deep gurgling gutturals. The problem I have comes from the lack of variety with his delivery. It's hard for me to adequately explain, but it sounds very much like he's talking normally while he's growling. It's not very compelling when he's doing this tedious delivery throughout the record. There's some parts where he chooses to pick up the pace on certain songs and sounds full of energy on those, but for most of the record, it gets boring to listen to.\n\nAnother problem is the lack of variety in the riffage, but this time it seems to be two-fold because it seems like the band cannot keep a consistent tempo throughout. All the way through, on almost every song, the tempo tends to slow down and the guitars fall out of sync with the drums and the vocals can't hope to keep up either. It doesn't sound good and it feels like they were playing their parts separate from one another, a couple guys in the studio in one city and the rest of the guys in another studio in another city. There's not a ton of cohesion or tightness in their performances as a unit and it makes some of the songs a bit hard to listen to. As far as the riffing goes, it's very simplistic. Lots of boring single note palm-muted chugging that's very primitive and uninteresting, to say the least. The moments that some would consider death metal like the quick tremolo picking are low-grade generic crap that anybody who has played guitar for a few months and has an ear for good death metal can play with their eyes closed. There's not a lot of play or chemistry between the three different guitarists here, either. Everything here could have been done with just one guitarist and a session guitarist and nothing would've been lost in the ether. Oh, and as is expected in a genre like this, the bass is pretty much nonexistent. It follows right behind the guitars and does nothing impressive. Then again, I don't even think a bass was necessary here. It may as well not even be there. With three guitarists, they may as well not even have bothered enlisting the help of a bassist. I'm pretty sure the bassist in this band could've booked a better gig after this kind of treatment.\n\nMaybe that's because the album is so monstrously overproduced. Everything is so unabashedly clean and it kind of feels lifeless in some places. The guitars are so polished, the drums sound so damn polished, that if there was any rawness this album was going for, it was lost in the extremely good production values. I don't mind a clean and polished production in my metal albums, but for a concept like this, you want there to be a little rawness in there. Leave some dirt behind to muddy the sound a bit to give the illusion of walking down a disgusting alleyway in the rainy darkness as prostitutes are being cut down to size. \n\nNow with all the bad things I've said about this record, are there any actual good moments? Yes, there are. The second breakdown on \u201cAlone In the Morgue\u201d really stands out from just about every other breakdown on the album. I love how it's delivered and the riff that scrapes in the background like a knife across stainless steel really gives the song a dark, ominous presence as it trudges towards its conclusion. The opening riff on \u201cArticulo Mortis\u201d is really chaotic as all hell, and the title track is fantastic. Kevin Lane, the drummer on this album, is definitely the star of the show. He creates some amazing fills and super fast pounding up and down the kit that is to be admired. He's constantly on the move here with moments that definitely give weight to some of the moments that you'd expect to suck. He saves them with a pretty solid performance. As well, as I've said before, Phil Bozeman's really deep growls definitely punch you in the gut when they hit. \u201cProstatic Fluid Asphyxiation\u201d isn't that bad of a track in some spots, especially in the first minute, which is one of the best parts of the album. That is, until it gets to the part where he screams that one unintentionally hilarious line before this abomination of a breakdown hits. You might wind up shutting the album off completely or pause the album to catch your breath after you've laughed so hard because of just how awful that part was.\n\nIn conclusion, this album isn't a good album, but it's not terrible enough for me to avoid recommending. It can get kind of funny at times with its atrocious lyrics that try so hard to be taken seriously, so just based off that it gets points. As I made clear at the beginning, I'm not a big consumer of deathcore material, and this is probably one of the better deathcore albums to come out. I'm just going to assume that, but I'm really not going to proceed further down the Whitechapel rabbit hole. This album has too many problems for me to continue, not to mention \u201cThe Saw is the Law\u201d didn't make me want to check out Whitechapel any less than I already did upon hearing this album from start to finish. \n\nI'll stick to Carnifex and All Shall Perish.\n\n\nRECOMMENDED TRACKS:\n-The Somatic Defilement\n-Alone in the Morgue\n-Articulo Mortis\n",
        "\nI am not the type of guy who enjoys deathcore records a lot. I have a certain taste when it comes to listening to this genre. In fact, Divine Heresy and All Shall Perish are the only bands that I dig when we talk about deathcore, and those two bands aren't even playing pure deathcore music. Those two play a more technical approach rather than deathcore's chuggy breakdown-filled character.\n\nI also enjoyed early deathcore releases of Job for a Cowboy and The Faceless. That was the time before these guys took their music to the realm of technical death metal. Other than those bands, I never really took the time to explore this genre and look for more artists who plays such style. Not even today. Let's just say that my interest in this genre had always depended on the albums put out by those four mentioned bands above.\n\nNow, Whitechapel is a Tennessee-based deathcore group that had been around quite a while. Never have I heard a song from these guys until I decided to listen to their debut studio record yesterday just to see if they have any potential. After listening to their debut, I opted to hear their follow-up materials. Finally, after four awful records from the band, I decided to stop. Then I came to a conclusion that I wasted half of a good day, owing to the fact that I took the time to tuned in to Whitechapel's crappy albums.\n\nThe Somatic Defilement is a shoddy piece of deathcore music that should not have been issued into the public. And honestly speaking, this is the only bearable album that the band had put out. The rest of their later records are a bunch of a more degraded carbon-copy of the debut. See, it's releases like these that made me stay away from picking up any materials from this music class. Even their three guitar players weren't able to give the album a lift. Really Whitechapel???! You had all the reinforcement that you can get, yet you guys have still failed to deliver even just a little amount of respectability to your album.\n\nThe whole offering is comprised of shitty generic breakdowns that even an eight year old can play much better, if that certain eight year old kid was taught well. Every damn track in here is loaded with pesky and annoying breakdowns. That's just one of the worst parts in this album. Another nauseating facet of this album is the triggered drumming. Often times when it comes to mediocre releases the drum section can save the whole album, but in this case it only made the whole listening experience more boring than ever. And then there's the feeble high pitched vocal cry of their frontman. Does he even know that he is not going to impress anyone no matter how hard he tries? I mean, his vocal delivery is utterly shallow, uninspired, and bizarre.\n\nAll-inclusively, The Somatic Defilement is a crummy and good-for-nothing debut album. I won't even bother expect that the band will make a decent release someday. I've listened to four of their six studio album yesterday and none gave any justice to my ears. Oh boy, I sure regret that I took their records into consideration yesterday.\n",
        "\nMany of you are probably looking at the title of the review and are no doubt thinking I\u2019m talking about an entirely different album altogether. I mean how can a deathcore album be background music, right? Background music is something you\u2019d apply to ambient, post rock, downtempo and the like, certainly not a Whitechapel album, but after spending some time with this album I can safely say that this is indeed, background music.\n\nNow by no means is this indicative of the quality of the music, I\u2019m not using background music as a criticism of the music but rather a descriptor of how I personally feel about it. Whitechapel is a very, very comfortable release that doesn\u2019t break any boundaries or is particularly extreme. It\u2019s pretty much the definition of deathcore, with much of it playing out like a jaunt through a Wikipedia article. It\u2019s a rather basic and archetypal album but it\u2019s good for what it is. It\u2019s not terribly involving and it\u2019s nice to have in the background when surfing the web or doing some other task that isn\u2019t mentally taxing. \n\nThe reason I like this album as background music only is because it\u2019s just not a very extreme album. Yes at times it\u2019s pretty heavy but it\u2019s not TOO heavy, it certainly won\u2019t rip your face off like Enmity and there\u2019s nothing about this album I find off putting or vexing. Musically this has a bit more death metal mixed in than your average deathcore band but it\u2019s still not too strong. There\u2019s a lot of chugging riffs and breakdowns thrown in without much standout riffs or solos, if any. It\u2019s a relatively risk free album and it\u2019s also a quiet one. Whereas Whitechapel used to make thunderous deathcore albums, on their self-titled they seem to have lost a lot of their visceral bite and as such the music feels a tad lethargic. However the music doesn\u2019t suffer from it as Whitechapel is eminently listenable. The song writing is a tad more mature and refined, the production is very thick and bass heavy which I like and all the instruments can be clearly heard. From a technical standpoint it\u2019s flawless. But yet the problem is that the album is a little too flawless. The music is all very surgical and precise and aside from the vocals there\u2019s very little to suggest that a human being had anything to do with the writing and recording. Previous Whitechapel outings had that power and oomph whereas this album there is none.\n\nI guess one could say my enjoyment of this album entirely depends on the mood I\u2019m in while listening to it. Like I\u2019ve mentioned before, for background music it\u2019s flawless but for more involved listening there\u2019s better music out there. To me the album seems to have been purposefully designed to be as comfortable and easy as possible. There\u2019s very little standout moments in this album, with most of the tracks passing by without leaving much of a mark. As such it\u2019s not a memorable album and I quickly forget it once it\u2019s done. This is a problem with a lot of deathcore lately in that the genre just isn\u2019t that memorable anymore and this album is a perfect example as to why that is. Of course it\u2019s very hard to criticise this album because there just isn\u2019t that much going on, there might be the odd passage that catches my ear for a few moments but then the band quickly reverts to going through the motions and my attention wavers. \n\nBy no means is this a bad album, it\u2019s just not a very interesting one. It\u2019s very competent at what it does and nothing about it pisses me off but at the same time there\u2019s nothing truly outstanding on this release. Surprisingly however, I\u2019d take this album over some of their earlier stuff as it\u2019s more refined and mature and does its job quite well. For what it\u2019s worth I quite like this album, I just wish more effort was put into making this more memorable. The album would have been a lot better as a result, and I could actually, you know, remember the songs.\n",
        "\nLet me preface this by saying I like Whitechapel. Their first three albums are deathcore classics, each with its own unique take on the subgenre, something many of today's copycats can't do. But after the mammoth of technical death metal infused chuggery that was A New Era of Corruption, Whitechapel really seemed to drop at an ever increasing rate. The self titled album just felt too safe and average to warrant constant listens, and didn't really take the creative possibilites of deathcore anywhere. Our Endless War's excessive Meshuggah worship (and not the good kind!) and preference for grooves wasn't all that nice either, but both albums still had their share of decent tracks. Mark of the Blade, however, is an absolute step in the WRONG direction entirely!\n\nThe production on this album is beyond awful. The guitars sound unbelievably dull and monotonous, and the band takes no advantage whatsoever of having THREE guitar players. THREE to play the same damn chug! The first three Whitechapel albums were definitely chuggy, but they had creative patterns and layers and deserved to be played by multiple guitarists. Here, it's dumbed down exponentially with b-rate Slipknot riffs and Hatebreed slams minus the flavor that Hatebreed at least attempts to bring to the table. The worst bits of Pantera are pretty obvious too, so if you can't stand Pantera (I certainly can't), you'll absolutely despise this album. The bass is rarely heard (no real surprise in deathcore, let's be honest), in fact I can only really hear it in the beginning to \"Bring Me Home\" and we'll get to that song.\n\nVocals...oh dear. Phil Bozeman is a VERY talented vocalist, one of the best not just in deathcore but in extreme metal as a whole. His range is beastly, from toilet-bowl gurgles to rapid-fire enunciated Corpsegrinder influenced growls to goblinoid shrieks. But here he focuses SOLELY on a crappy mid-range \"growl\" that sounds more like he's talking with a metric ton of effects on his voice, along with some Jamey Jasta ripoff hardcore shouts in more songs than any sane human would hope for. Phil did introduce clean singing for the first time in Whitechapel's career in two songs on this album, a fairly melancholic ballad \"Bring Me Home\" which actually has some effort in it despite the obvious Corey Taylor-isms and the six minute closer \"Decennium\" where somewhat better harmonized vocals are used along with Phil's now-decrepit and abysmally bad growls. If you can even call them that.\n\nLyrically I couldn't give a shit but a couple songs stand out in cringe-worthy places. Firstly, the song \"Elitist Ones\" is a strike out at the pricks who think deathcore isn't \"metal\" because the subgenre's fans don't often wear \"battle jackets\" or have long hair or other meaningless scene crap that makes old-school metal fans more of scene kids than the people they claim ARE in fact scene kids. DEATHCORE IS METAL WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. But having such a tryhard tough guy reaction to these idiots like \"Show some fucking respect, karma will come for your neck\" isn't getting you anywhere. Granted everybody's an elitist nowadays. I'm sure Whitechapel means well with this song but they could have written it much better. Next is \"A Killing Industry\" which is basically a massive exercise in hypocrisy. The song's more or less about how Whitechapel have evolved and don't ant to do the same thing over and over again (nobody asked them to) and they're not writing albums for fame or money or shit. Constantly repeating the phrase \"I just don't give a fuck\" doesn't help their case. Their increased dumbing down of music, devolution into a mishmash of nu metal and hardcore that's been done before, and elimination of many of the elements that made them a pretty unique band to begin with has resulted in a band that has completely lost touch with the music around them and had become, despite the band members being rather young, more or less a legacy act in deathcore. Still going to play the songs people know because they were good songs, but only hardcore fans are going to find much to enjoy in their new material, if any, and if you DO enjoy this album by all means continue to do so if it is actually because you like it and not because Whitechapel is your favorite band or something. As for me, a relative fan of early Whitechapel, I could do without listening to this excessively long, dull, and completely toothless piece of musical dreck ever again.\n",
        "\nThe deathcore scene of the mid-late 2000s is one of the most criticized eras of metal. I\u2019m sure most of us remember the neon band tees, gauged ears, and emo-kid hairdos. The music was a cornucopia of breakdowns, pig squealing, dropped A guitars, and lots of ex-girlfriend lyrics. All in all, those were ridiculous days. And to make matters worse, you had countless bands trying so hard to copy the sound of Suicide Silence\u2019s The Cleansing. Hence, the term \u201cSuicide Silence clone\u201d was born.\n\nAnd yet, amidst this movement of scene kid poserdom, you could potentially find a release that truly stood out from the generics. And Whitechapel\u2019s debut full-length comes to mind.\n\nThe Somatic Defilement is not a Cleansing or Doom. Forget the HxC breakdowns, emo lyrics, and (cringy) anthemic vocal breaks. Just throw those out the window. Take what\u2019s left and add in a tech-death influence, guttural vocals, and some breakdowns much more intelligent and memorable than expected. That\u2019s the sound you get from Whitechapel back in 2007.\n\nThe album begins with a audio clip of Dahmer with some creepy static, and then rips into the title track. \u201cThe Somatic Defilement\u201d kicks off with a massive slam riff accompanied by vocalist Phil Bozeman\u2019s deep, guttural growling. The song\u2019s intro does drag on for some time, but finally transitions into a complex riff reminiscent of old Cryptopsy. The song contains many of these riffs before the first breakdown begins. What you\u2019ll notice is that there\u2019s no buildup, no anthemic vocal break, and no bassdrop. Just pure downtuned, vicious breaking. The other breakdown is just as heavy, and neither does that one use the moshing rhythm. To make things interesting, the song concludes with a melodic outro, the band fading away and leaving a violin section to finish the song.\n\nThroughout the rest of the album, you\u2019ll find much more of this. What\u2019s nice about The Somatic Defilement, that I can\u2019t say about a lot of other deathcore albums, is that the songs can be distinguished from each other. The guitar riffs are quite interesting, actually. There\u2019s no solos, or really any \u201cshredding\u201d so to speak, but Ben Savage, Zack Householder, and Alex Wade definitely possess much skill and writing ability. Drummer Kevin Lane performs excellently \u2013 his double-bass usage is not overdone like you\u2019d hear in a lot of other deathcore bands, and his diversity in rhythms and blast beats give him much credibility.\n\nBozeman is an excellent vocalist in general, but this album is where he shined his brightest. His growls and gutturals are powerful as all hell, deep, and menacing. His high screams aren\u2019t the best, but fortunately he utilizes them very sparingly.\nWhitechapel\u2019s lyrics on this album are probably the least deathcore thing about it. The whole album focuses on a narrative of Jack the Ripper. The lyrics are styled like traditional death metal \u2013 instead of complaining and crying, there\u2019s gore, torture, sadism, rape, and other pleasant things you might hear from the likes of Obituary and Cannibal Corpse.\n\nMy favorite track on the album is \u201cVicer Exciser\u201d, which relies on speed, being possibly the fastest song on the album. It doesn\u2019t take even to breathe, keeping it technical and brutal the whole way through, and its brevity gives it that feeling of a spontaneous, vicious sonic attack. The breakdown in the middle is insane.\n\nNow, as a deathcore fan, I tend to be more accepting of the genre. But I do understand why a lot of older metal fans dislike it \u2013 it really is a very silly genre and there\u2019s definitely a lot more style to it than substance. But The Somatic Defilement is that album which when you hear, you\u2019re expecting some emo kid to be screaming about his pathetic life with the band just chugging constantly \u2013 but instead, you\u2019re treated to an intelligent fusion of oldschool technical death metal and pure, unwatered hardcore. Even if you don\u2019t like deathcore, this album is worth checking out. You might be surprised. For deathcore fans, it\u2019s an essential genre classic.\n",
        "\nYou read that right. \n\n0/100. As in, there were one hundred possible points that Whitechapel's debut could have achieved, and it scored zero. Is that histrionic? Maybe. But maybe not - as extreme as it sounds, I wouldn't hesitate to say that this album is devoid of artistic value.\n\nMaybe it's the concept - or rather, how horribly the concept comes across. At heart, a concept album sung from the perspective of Jack the Ripper is pretty metal. Plenty of bands, good and bad, have delved into the minds of serial killers, from Slayer to Sepultura to Slipknot. It's a lyrical genre that suits the music well. Metal can be beautiful but is so often insidious and evil, and the serial killer is perhaps the most frightening image it can conjure - all the spectacle of a slasher flick villain without the celluloid to keep you safe. So it should work, right? Well, not always. The key to effectively evoking a killer is to sound either maniacally insane or cold and calculating. Vocalist Phil Bozeman accomplishes neither. His shock-value lyricism reads like a comb through medical journals and thesauruses. Sure, lots of great metal bands ham it up a bit in the lyrics sheets, but you don't always need to \"eviscerate\" when \"gutting\" will do the job.\n\nTypical death metal and deathcore themes are touched on throughout the record's mercifully short run. There's necrophilia, dismemberment, and a fair share of gross-out language intended to offend more than express. Sadly, Bozeman makes it clear that he has absolutely no idea how to actually use the vocabulary he employs. Some lines, like \"I find a sense in malpracticing the common ways\", aren't even complete thoughts, much less well-structured English sentences. Others, such as \"I must purloin the genitalia\", read like absurdist humor. Even worse are lines like \"You've been dismembered and molested\", which explicitly steal lyrics from bands who actually know how to use them.\n\nThis thievery isn't confined to the lyrics, either. Nearly every breakdown, intro riff and vocal rhythm in the album has been recorded by better bands in years past. The album sounds like a \"worst-of\" compilation from the biggest Florida death metallers, sewn together by a Hollywood producer aiming to cash in on the newest bunch of kids in camo shorts and half-inch plugs.\n\nIf that image isn't what you associate with metal, this is not the album for you. Bozeman's boring, \"brutal\" vocals bog down the already unlistenable lyrics. Three guitars try and fail to do what one well-written guitar easily could. Pounding drums ignore any nuance, preferring to pummel the listener into oblivion - a feat that would be much more easily accomplished if the bass drum sounded like a bass drum instead of a typewriter. \n\nUltimately, the album is a sheep in wolves' clothing. It's like Whitechapel went to the death metal Wikipedia page and took their best notes. They've got the growled vocals, and the detuned guitars, and the provocative lyrics. But this formula won't give you a good album. It'll give you Death Metal For Dummies, the best way to sound like death metal to someone who's never heard the style before. Behind the jagged logo and the noisy music is just a bunch of guys who don't fully understand what they're trying to do.\n\nI've given this album more than a few chances. No matter how hard I try, I just can't find a single redeeming feature on The Somatic Defilement. Steeped in breakdowns and groove sections, it exemplifies some of the very worst traits of modern metal. Whitechapel has certainly made some decent records throughout their ten-year tenure, but this is not one of them.\n",
        "\nWhitechapel managed to get a good amount of attention after they released The Somatic Defilement, and for good reason. That album was sheer excellence to me. However, they managed to more attention with their second album, This is Exile. This album is often regarded as the band's best release, and for the most part, I agree with that.\n\nIn terms of heaviness and brutality, this album is a bit of a step back from The Somatic Defilement. However, that's not saying a big lot, because this album is still heavy as fuck and contains a great amount of brutality. A good chunk of the brutal death metal influence found on The Somatic Defilement is no longer present on this album. This album has more of a focus on melody than the previous album does (although that album also had some melody at times) and the instrumentation is a bit more technical. There is still a good amount of chugging with the guitars and they also expanded a bit on the Meshuggah-influenced guitar lines (or \"djent,\" if you will, although I hate that term) from the previous album. They also added a few solos onto the album, such as in \"Father of Lies\" and \"To All That Are Dead,\" which sound excellent. There are certain times where the guitars give off a really ghastly atmosphere, with \"Death Becomes Him,\" one of two instrumentals, being the best showcase of this. The drumming on this album is pretty much similar to The Somatic Defilement, containing a great amount of technicality, as well as blast beats, double bass and fills being in good quantities. \"Messiahbolical\" contains an ambient section around the end that also gives off that ghastly atmosphere, and I love it. There is a good amount of breakdowns on this album, but they are all very fun breakdowns that are extremely crushing (the very first breakdown in \"Possession,\" still gives me chills to this day, probably being my favorite breakdown on the entire album).\n\nPhil Bozeman's vocals are still as amazing as they were on The Somatic Defilement. He's still able to hit those nasty gutturals from that album and his high screams sound better too. He can also go very fast, as shown in the beginning of Possession and there are gang shouts at one part in Messiahbolical that I could've lived without, but I can tolerate them being there. \"Exalt\" contains a brief guest appearance from Guy Kuzowyk of The Red Chord, sounding as great as he normally does. The lyrics are also different this time around. The Somatic Defilement was a concept album based on the murders of Jack the Ripper, while this time around, they decided to focus more on demonic lyrical themes. I find these lyrics to be very enjoyable and very well-written.\n\nOverall, this album is fantastic. While a bit more accessible and not as heavy as The Somatic Defilement(which even that isn't saying very much), I find this album to be more enjoyable and I agree with this album being their best release (although it's probably tied with A New Era of Corruption). I'd recommend this, but if you're familiar with the deathcore genre, you most likely already heard it and if you're a deathcore fan, you probably love it to the same extent as I do.\n",
        "\nNow, I don't know much about Whitechapel, I know that occasionally they come up on my Pandora stations and that what it plays is generally run of the mill deathcore that fails to impress me or strike further interest. So on my own I probably wouldn't have ever poked into this, but thank you Metal Blade records for acting like this album was the best thing since putting butter on sliced bread, seriously, I was getting hit so hard with the ads and recommendations for this thing on every social media network I'm on that you'd think Metal Blade literally thought this was the only album they were releasing that they could break even on. Well, sorry Metal Blade, try pushing one of your other releases off the shelves instead, because I'm not paying for this.\n\nIt's like an awkward mix of deathcore, djent and groove metal. Even though it sticks to being a pretty commercially safe endeavor for the band it still is really about as experimental as they've ever gotten. Its also pretty awkward, particularly in the guitar department because they try to mix all three of those influences into the riffs. They have that djenty guitar tone with the palm muting and the high gain, then they try to write riffs with that chugging deathcore quality, but that still try to run smoothly enough to you know, groove. I'm not sure how to really describe it, so just think of that riff on the chorus from Pantera's '5 Minutes Alone', that nananya nananya nininoo, but instead make all of the notes a chug, the chugging quality would ruin the flow of that riff right? That's what I mean, they're trying to both chug and have these catchy riffs, but the chugging breaks the flow of it, which is a vital component of how groove riffs work. Which isn't to say that Pantera and other groove acts don't do their own share of chugging, but they make sure their catchy groovy riffs flow.\n\nThen we have Phil's vocals, which aren't anything special. Now of the tons of advertising I've seen for this album like 37% of it has been \"Phil Bozeman proves himself to be the best vocalist in metal with...\", its unfair for me to judge an album based on how the guys tried to sell it, but I'm sorry, calling him the best vocalist did no favors. I'm expecting growls that reach record lows or a guy who can hold the mic a good distance from his face and still come through just fine. What I actually got was a guy who has to cup the mic to be audible, who's range is nothing special, pretty average really. I was set up to be extremely disappointed and I'm not going to shy away from letting that disappointment find its way into this review.\n\nThe drumming here is pretty standard. Thump thud thump thud thump thud. There was some double pedal here and there as well, but overall the drumming was unspectacular and unimpressive. The bass is towards the back and largely suffers from the same issue as the rhythm guitarist, he's trying to make too many things fit together and its not coming out the way I think he wanted it to. All that being said though, the production was pretty strong, clean and polished enough to make proper use of those djent tones but gritty and dirty enough to play with the deathcore sound. All the instruments were audible, they perhaps could've brought the vocals down a peg or two to help the bass and drums, but overall pretty good sound wise.\n",
        "\nMark of the Blade is at once a celebration of many of the bases touched upon by previous Whitechapel albums, and sort of a mixed bag that signifies they're not quite sure where they want to go or who they want to be right now. That's not to say it's a bad record, necessarily, because even as someone who has rarely enjoyed any of their output, I thought that this hit enough of a quote of entertaining moments to dub it one of their better efforts. But the bulk of the material here definitely seems like it's simultaneously exploratory and constantly looking backwards, trying to flesh out ideas they might not have taken to their natural conclusions in the past, yet not willing to go far enough to make them stick.\n\nProduction is total brickhouse, with a mixture of thrashy melodeath rhythm guitars that feed into fat-bottomed grooves which themselves teeter between the djent and deathcore niches, without much resolution as to which side of that fence they're going to land on. The bass guitar has this enormous, bouncy tone which you can really feel in your stomach when they bust into the meathead hardcore breakdowns, almost like some heavily tatted GQ dudes are lining up to use your gut as a trampoline for their fists. But they also go for some brief, intimate moments like the intro to \"Bring Me Home\" where they're attempting to show off their sensitive side, clean guitar sounds and soothing vocals and a progression which almost reminded me of Tool or A Perfect Circle before the requisite clobbering rhythms begin. Tremolo picked melodies are often added as layers beneath the dense, roiling strata of mosh-oriented violence to add a little bit of a post-modern feel to the brocore step that they're often pretty loyal to, and the hoarse and antagonistic vocals of Phil Bozeman definitely sound as angry as I've heard in the past, especially in the lyrics to songs like \"Tormented\" or \"Elitist Ones\" where they definitely have a Hatebreed-like social hardcore aesthetic with even a little hip-hop or Biohazard to the syllable choices.\n\nHell, along with the pork-toned bass in the latter, it's quite funny to the point that I broke out laughing...but you wouldn't wanna get run down by these dudes in an alley regardless. Neither would I. The joke would be over then, as they beat me within an inch of never reviewing a deathcore band again. But yeah, there are lots of little deviations here or there where the aggression will cut out and they'll launch into something which feels progressive by comparison, and that actually creates an air of nuance to what they've recorded here. I can't accuse Whitechapel of not trying to write actual songs, or not trying to better themselves, because I feel like they're doing both. It's whether or not the riffs or the lyrics resonate with me here that matters, and to my chagrin, they really did not. Not for a lack of effort, though, and to their credit, they've done a far better job with this than their shoddy last album, Our Endless War, while still flirting with the more accessible goals of that album and then mixing 'em up with the 'classic' 2007-2010 era and a bit of the finesse of the self-titled disc (which remains my favorite). Hell, my 3-year old was going mental to this shit, jumping up and down on our futon and did a somersault or two into other nearby furniture. So...that there is something. Not a lot. But enough.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhitechapel really took a gamble when they released their self-titled album in 2012. This album is quite a bit different than the past three. I will always consider \"The Somatic Defilement\" to be their crowning achievement, which is followed closely by \"This Is Exile\". \"A New Era of Corruption\" is probably on the same level as \"This Is Exile\" for me, making these two albums tie with one another as Whitechapel's second best release. So, where does \"Whitechapel\" fall in? I'd say it's their third best album. It's quite different but in this case, different is certainly not bad. With more melody and solos, this album definitely showcases Whitechapel's relevance as a leading band in the deathcore genre.\n\nThe music here is far more atmospheric than Whitechapel has ever produced before. These songs possess a certain sound that distinguish themselves from any of the songs on the band's previous albums. The guitars on this albums sound overall more competent and a bit more technical without losing their signature sound. There are still three guitarists and they all work together to bring the wall of noise even more forward and make everything sound more crushing than it would if the band just stuck to two. Something that really sticks out here is the inclusion of many more guitar solos than before. \"This Is Exile\" and to an extent \"A New Era...\" have them as well, but here, they are more common and sound overall much better. \"Make It Bleed\" actually has one of the album's finest solos, and this is the song that opens it up! \"(Cult)uralist\" and especially \"I, Dementia\", which happens to be one of my favorites from the album, also contain my top picks for guitar solos. Also, those breakdowns that we have always heard in Whitechapel's music actually sound far better here and actually more structured than before. They sound more like chugged riffs than breakdowns at times and sound far more welcomed in these songs. \"Make It Bleed\" is probably my overall favorite song on the album. For some reason, that atmospheric (there's that word again!) piano intro just hits my ears in the sweet spot every time. \n\nPhil's vocals are still as crushing and distinctive as ever on this album. There are plenty of deathcore bands that tend to utilize vocalists and vocal styles that sound similar to one another but Phil manages to distinguish himself from a lot of these other bands. He has a very deep, guttural sounding voice but you can understand all of the lyrics on the album. On \"I, Dementia\", he includes a clean, whispered segment that really adds a lot of atmosphere to the song. This is sure to sound weird to a lot of people but it works quite well. The lyrics do sound somewhat silly but that doesn't distract my ears from the vocals themselves. \n\nThis album also ends the same way it began. The final track \"Possibilities of an Impossible Existence\" contains that same piano melody that kicked the album off and it sounds just as beautiful here as it did before. There is just something about it that tickles my fancy; I can't really say why or how, it just does, and it sounds great. I love hearing bands open and close an album in the same way, as it feels like the beginning and ending of a story, almost like a concept album of sorts. This album surely has garnered its share of polarizing opinions and discontent but it's probably Whitechapel's most \"mature\" album musically. I can't say it's their best but it's still great to my ears.\n",
        "\nWhitechapel sure had a lot to live up to after releasing the \"classic\" \"The Somatic Defilement\" in 2007. Exactly a year later, the dudes would drop their sophomore full-length album \"This Is Exile\", which is often acclaimed by many fans as the band's crowning achievement. Personally, I still find \"The Somatic Defilement\" to be the band's finest hour. However, \"This Is Exile\" is exactly what you would expect from Whitechapel at the time: finely crafted deathcore with an amazing collection of riffs, crushing breakdowns, and it seemed on this album, soloing would become more common than before. Well, to an extent, anyway. This album is not as brutal or crushing as its precursor, but it is still pretty damn good, and an essential listen for any deathcore fan. \n\nAlthough I said this album is not as heavy as the previous effort, make no mistake. This album will still blow your balls off. \"Father of Lies\" gets things kicking with a straight up death metal riff accompanied by a blast beat and the three guitarists add so much atmosphere to the overall heaviness throughout. The solo in this song is probably the most impressive on the album although, at this point, solos were still fairly atypical in Whitechapel's music, and this solo is not super technical or really all that impressive. \"To All That Are Dead\" contains a more technically proficient solo but still, I think I prefer the solo in \"Father of Lies\" above all just because it seems better placed and more effective for what it is. There is a fine mix of melody and aggression in these guitar riffs. The title track seems to be the fan favorite of this album but with songs such as those I mentioned earlier, as well as \"Possession\" and the epic closer \"Messiahbolical\", the title track seems to fall behind in comparison. The eerie intro to the instrumental piece \"Death Becomes Him\" is perhaps the most atmospheric on the entire album and these three guitars really work quite well to bring the album together as one. This album is definitely more accessible and \"listener friendly\" than the previous and although it's certainly not as heavy, it's still, as I said before, essential. And of course, since we are discussing a deathcore album here, it is only appropriate to include some of this album's finest breakdowns. \"Father of Lies\" surely has it's fair share, and the breakdowns in that title track are crushing, but where lies the best breakdown? Honestly for me, the second and final instrumental number \"Of Legions\" holds the best breakdowns. They are accompanied with extremely atmospheric guitar passages and just sound absolutely amazing. \n\nOverall, the drumming here is quite similar and familiar. Double bass, blast beats, and impressive fills are all ever present on this release. He is one of the highlights of this band and always has been and, on future releases, this will continue to remain the same. There is some technicality to the drumming when he is not following along to a breakdown and even those who detest Whitechapel or deathcore in general seem to be on familiar ground with this. \"Exalt\" contains some of the best drumming you will hear on the album but really, you could take any of these songs and the drumming would remain impressive and proficient. \n\nPhil's vocals seem to be a bit more refined and clear this time around, probably due to the crisper and much clearer production. This album is definitely not as dirty sounding as the previous which definitely makes it easier to hand for those who generally stay clear of this style of extreme music. Fear not, however; his gutturals are amazing on this album. He uses his typical extremely low growls and grunts and more so on this album, utilizes an almost blackened scream. This gives the music an overall much more blackened atmosphere. Phil is probably my favorite vocalist in the deathcore genre, seeing as he's pretty much the closest to death metal you can get. There are no pig squeals on this album and I'm sure a lot of people are extremely appreciative of that. \n\nIf you enjoyed \"The Somatic Defilement\", even though this album is better produced and overall more melodic, I'm sure you'd still enjoy this too. This is often seen as the band's breakthrough album due to its \"easier listening\" and while that may be true, it is still a crushing, brutal piece of deathcore that certainly contains that heaviness and destructive quality Whitechapel is known for. This is the album many people get into the band with and because of its accessibility, this makes a lot of sense. Enjoy this piece of melodic yet destructive deathcore!\n",
        "\nHeavy death metal inspired riffs? Check! Blast beats? Check! Effective use of crushing breakdowns? Check! To the world of deathcore, Whitechapel is a band that needs no introduction. They are from Knoxville, Tennessee and have generated a lot of polarizing opinions in the realm of extreme metal. \"The Somatic Defilement\" was the band's first release after a couple of fairly decent demos. This is, in my opinion, their heaviest album and also their best to this date.\n\nWhitechapel is known for incorporating three guitarists. This has sparked a fair amount of controversy among much of the general population of metal fans and because Whitechapel is a deathcore band, most people are quick to loathe them for this. I personally think these three guitarists add a great deal to the music, mainly in terms of sheer brutality. This is one of the heaviest albums ever released by a deathcore album and even competes with a lot of actual death metal bands in my opinion. There aren't a whole lot of technically impressive riffs here. Most of the song structures follow a generally similar pattern to one another, utilizing death metal riffs and the breakdowns typical in deathcore, which are, of course, enhanced a bit by the bass. Although most of the time, the third guitar detracts the bass a bit which really is not that big of a deal for me. Really, this band has created a good balance between the two and the three guitars only enhance the experience. The guitar work in the title track is probably my favorite on the entire album. From the riffs to the breakdowns, to that melodic section at the end that leads into the orchestral outro. Unfortunately, this album does lack guitar solos. I like to hear a few solos in my deathcore but in reality, that can be a very rare thing. \"Festering Fiesta\" contains a section that almost qualifies as a solo but it wouldn't be until the band's next album that they actually started using them somewhat. Even so, this does not degrade my opinion of the album at all, because it's just so damn good otherwise. Just listen to the crushing breakdowns in \"Vicer Exciser\"! Man does that song rip.\n\nThe drums follow along smoothly with the riffs and breakdowns and never deviate from the flow. There is a lot of double bass and blast beats which are very common in deathcore, thanks to the drums being heavily influenced by death metal. They don't really step outside of their comfort zone, rather they stick to similar ideas throughout the album's 32 minutes. This is nothing to worry over, however; these drums get the job done in the most efficient ways possible. This album's sole purpose is to absolutely crush you and the drums definitely contribute to that. In addition to the drums, Phil Bozeman's vocals are as brutal as ever. He uses a no BS guttural approach and on this album, he probably give his best vocal performance. Songs like the title-track contain a lot of low, evil sounding growls. He uses a mix of growls and screams but generally sticks to a lower growl, and his screams become more prominent on later albums. I much prefer his growls on here over anything. The lyrical content generally revolves around the murders committed by Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel, England. Because of his killings being gruesome in nature, the lyrics can be pretty \"messed up\" which adds a lot to the already brutal music. I have definitely heard worse, though. What's somewhat funny in a sick, twisted way is how a lot of his victims seemed to be prostitutes so in a way, this album is all about killing sluts. Oh, yay!\n\nI must say this is one of the finest deathcore albums ever recorded, as well as my first Whitechapel album and one of the albums that made me realize maybe not all deathcore is crap. Really, I would recommend this to not just a fan of deathcore but a fan of death metal as well, preferably brutal death or slam. If you're a fan of deathcore, however, you probably have already heard this. If not, you are certainly missing out.\n",
        "\nPretty much anything can go down the drain, and this includes death metal. By the way, this is not real death metal, this is deathcore, which is sort of the evolution of death metal into a lower being.\n\nI hate to sound like a stupid, annoying elitist, but This is Exile is a terrible album from a terrible band. It does have a few moments which I admit are catchy, but overall, the album is very annoying and unpleasant to listen to. Sure, it's brutal, but what the fuck does that mean. Simply having catchy, heavy breakdowns does not make music good. What makes music good is a balance of technicality and musicality, which this obviously lacks. It has a few technical sections, but everything is very poorly written. This is like some Slipknot fans learned to play death metal, and so deathcore was born.\n\nThe vocals on here are boring as fuck. Luckily, pig squeals are not the main element, but the growls are flat and boring. There is little emotion behind them, other than a bit of anger that appears to be angry at nothing. High screams are used to a lesser extent, and they are honestly quite good, and could have been used a bit more here. The low \"brutal\" vocals get very annoying.\n\nMost of the riffs on This Is Exile are generic beyond belief. We have the typical \"chug chug chug chug\" type shit with the occasional quasi-lead fill. When chugging and filling is not being done, annoying melodic metalcore riffs and tremolo riffs are being played in low tunings. The guitar playing is definitely not interesting. The same goes for the bass, but to an even greater extent. I can't even really hear the bass, but my guess is that it is following the guitar.\n\nI am sure my overt negativity towards This Is Exile is getting annoying, so why not share some of the albums higher points? The drumming, I admit, is good. The drums are perhaps the highest point here. Some great drum fills are played, but like everything else on the album, it gets repetitive and annoying. The one good song on the album is Possession. It has some nice vocal lines, but the lyrics are fucking stupid.\n\nThis Is Exile sucks because it tries to hard to be badass. Music is about much more than just being badass. Whitechapel need to stop focusing on being brutal, and they need to start focusing on the music itself, and making it pleasant to listen to.\n",
        "\nThis is an absolute fucking monster of an album. This easily takes the cake for being one of the heaviest deathcore albums. There is very little to complain about, because the brutality of the album is so enjoyable, it doesn't even matter. \n\nPhil Bozeman's vocals here are very strong, and low. He growls, gurgles, grunts, and screams extremely well. It seems like he went with a slam approach with the abundance of gutturals and the deepness of his vocals on the album. Needless to say, he is a huge part of this album and his contribution is a very big one.\n\nThe guitars are almost on the same level as the vocals. They unleash some very brutal chugged riffs that sound very slam and make the album seem even heavier. However, they don't chug the whole entire album. There is still some noticeable melody and some very clever sounding passages which stand out and shine very well. They tend to get a bit repetitive, but for the most part the guitars are very solid.\n\nThe bass isn't too easy to hear, but I've actually been able to hear it a bit in some parts. It's pretty much the same as the guitar so it's not terribly special, but just being able to hear it is always a plus because with bass that is a rarity.\n\nThe drumming, wow the drumming. It's not outstanding or amazing, but fuck it's still pretty crazy. Kevin Lane unleashes some of the fastest and heaviest double bass kicks. His drumming sounds devastating, and he absolutely obliterates the kit. He also knows how to follow with the rest of the band and remains strong and consistent throughout the whole album. The breakdowns, while a bit excessive, are extremely well done, especially for the time. They hit hard and deliver with intensity, and heaviness. Some of the breakdowns on Devirgination Studies, and Vicer Exciser are great examples of this. I understand this is an old deathcore album, but the production still falls flat a bit, while still not being awful. The Somatic Defilement is a masterpiece because it is almost perfectly executed and incorporates slam influences to it, which makes it only sound even heavier. Very good album, please check it out.\n",
        "\n(Update from 2016-08-17: not only was my previous review of this album a bit outdated and I have slightly different thoughts now, but reading it a year later, some of the things in that review just made me cringe. This is a slightly rewritten version that I find a bit less cringe-worthy.)\n\nWhitechapel is a band that needs no introduction. Anybody familiar with the deathcore genre knows who this band is. I personally think they are the best in their genre and they're personally my favorite band in general. I honestly think everything they released is awesome. I'm not trying to sound like a mindless sheep who just blindly worships everything a band releases. I just think their entire discography is THAT good. This is certainly no exception. This album was probably the heaviest deathcore album released during its time and to this day, is still one of the heaviest deathcore albums (and albums in general) that I've ever heard.\n\nThe intro, \"Necrotizing,\" is just a serial killer sample. It's okay I guess. It doesn't too much other than just go along with the album.\n\nPhil Bozeman is one of the best vocalists in deathcore, hands down. The only vocalist in the genre I currently think is better than Phil is Dickie Allen from Infant Annihilator. His growls can go extremely low and sound brutal as hell, and his screams are amazing. He gets some shit for his screams but I think they pretty damn good. He does more lows a bit more than highs. He also shows the impressive amount of time he can hold a growl for on the title track. And on the title track, I think I heard 2 gang shouts.I normally think gang shouts sound stupid but those didn't sound too bad.\n\nPhil's lyrics are pretty damn great as well. This might just be me but I don't see why he gets crap for his lyrics on their later albums. As most of you know, this is a concept album based on the murders Jack the Ripper committed. I like the detail he uses to describe the torture. The only song on the album that isn't really related to Jack the Ripper is \"Alone in the Morgue.\" According to Phil, it's \"a simple song about a coroner who is a demented necrophiliac.\" \"Festering Fiesta\" might be about Jack the Ripper but Phil also said that it \"focuses on more of a Jeffery Dahmer approach.\" I also think it was kind of cool how \"Articulo Mortis,\" the final track, is basically a fabrication of Jack the Ripper conversing with one of his dead victims and feeling regret for what he did. So overall, the lyrics are awesome in my opinion. \n\nThe instrumentation is top notch, heavy and can be pretty technical. The guitarists do a pretty solid job are creating good and memorable riffs. The riffing is mostly based influenced by brutal and technical death metal, but there are some melodic death metal riffs that pop up here and there that wouldn't sound out of place coming from a band like The Black Dahlia Murder. There are also some Meshuggah-esque guitar lines, like in \"Prostatic Fluid Asphyxiation,\" which are pretty cool too. The drums are very fast and impressive with some pretty good blast beats. The bass is inaudible. The breakdowns are crushing and chaotic too. There are a lot of them, which might turn some people off. But if it makes anything better, they don't use the same breakdown more than once. So that might be an upside for some people. There is also some symphonic stuff at the end of the title track that I really dig. The production on this album is really raw and dirty, which adds to the ridiculous heaviness of this album.\n\nOne flaw with this album that isn't really a flaw for me, but might turn some people off is that this album is a bit repetitive. A lot of the tracks on here sound kind of similar, although I don't think it's to the point where it just sounds like one giant song. Then again, that's probably because of how many times I listened to this album.\n\nSo, overall, The Somatic Defilement is a damn awesome record. It's pretty much a musical equivalent to a morbid horror movie. Although this is indubitably their heaviest release, I personally prefer This is Exile and A New Era of Corruption. But that doesn't make this album any less amazing and it's definitely worthy of the praise it gets from the deathcore fanbase and it was a great note to start their career on.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve heard music that sucks way, way more than this, but I haven\u2019t heard something this disappointing in a long time. Whitechapel may be one of better deathcore bands (they actually are among better deathcore bands), but how much does that fact mean? Considering most deathcore I\u2019ve heard sounds downright awful, this is actually pretty good, but is otherwise not much of an album.\n\nPhil Bozeman is a competent vocalist, no two ways about it. In fact, he\u2019s one of few deathcore vocalists that actually sound like death metal vocalists and I can appreciate it. He can growl and he can shriek. However, let\u2019s not kid ourselves, he cannot compete with George \u201cCorpsegrinder\u201d Fisher (Cannibal Corpse), Glen Benton (Deicide) or Piotr Wiwczarek (Vader) in any way. Still, he is the highlight of this album, because everything else pales in comparison for many reasons.\n\nLet\u2019s start with guitars. Seriously, three guitarists? It works great in Iron Maiden, but that\u2019s because Iron Maiden guitarists do not stick to playing the same riff (also because Iron Maiden songs have cool solos), while the three guitarists in Whitechapel do play the same exact riff, so one guitarist would have been enough for this band. Speaking of which, most of the riffs found here sound awfully similar and are pretty uninteresting. As a result, the songs feel awfully similar, if not the same. Here and there, it is possible to hear some sections that try to break the monotony (a short solo in Father of Lies being one example), but more often than not to no avail. The drums are standard for deathcore: some blast beats here and there (for instance, at the very beginning of Father of Lies), following the other instruments in most other situations. The bass? Don\u2019t come looking for it, you will not hear it. The breakdowns found on this album are not nearly as bad as they can be in deathcore, but it still doesn\u2019t mean much.\n\nOverrated, dull, boring, disappointing, monotonous, feel free to choose your pick among these adjectives, because this album really disappointed me. It seems deathcore is definitely not for me. Most of the points go to Phil Bozeman and because Father of Lies still feels better than the rest of the album. Unless you\u2019re into deathcore, no need to look this up. If you have to check it out, proceed with caution.\n",
        "\nUpon looking at the cover art for Whitechapel's \"Our Endless War\", with it's monochrome colors and a legible logo replacing the old \"death metal\" font, I felt like I was about to listen to a band in the midst of either a stylistic transition or an identity crisis brought by pressure from the more djent inspired deathcore acts such as Born of Osiris. After sitting through 40 or so minutes of repetitive groove riffs and growled vocals, it became obvious that while I was wrong about the transition, the identity crisis diagnosis is not far off. In \"Our Endless War\", every time Whitechapel stumble upon a good musical idea that would allow their music to transcend the deathcore genre, they slip back into their comfort zone of repetitive groove metal-esque breakdowns, resulting in album that is willing, but unable, to stand out.\n\nA large part of the problem is Whitechapel's insistence on sticking to the basic format of deathcore, which consists of repetitive breakdowns and grooves. So think \"Far Beyond Driven\" era Pantera or any late 90s nu metal band, but with a death metal vocalist. Of course, anyone who is familiar with those two pieces of metal history knows that a groove and breakdown-based song structure grows old fast, and no amount of brutal death metal vocals can fix that. The worst offender in this case would be the title track and \"The Saw is The Law\", the later of which has an opening guitar section that could have been ripped from Slipknot's debut. As mentioned earlier, Whitechapel occasionally deviate from this formula, such as the melodic guitars towards the end of \"Our Endless War\" and \"Let Me Burn\", but they make the mistake of putting the interesting parts of the songs at the end, when the listener has since lost interest in the repeated breakdown sections that never seem to end. \"Worship the Digital Age\" reverses the formula by starting out with a fairly thrashy and energetic verse section, reverting back to the slow groove in the middle and end of the song, effectively undoing the reason you even started paying attention to the song in the first place.\n\nThankfully for Whitechapel (and unthankfully for the listener who chooses to sit through the full album), \"Our Endless War\" is one of those albums where the quality of the songs improve greatly as the album goes on. \"Mono\", the fourth track on the album is the first time on the album that Whitechapel seem to be working outside the box for most of the album, but it is not until \"Psychopath\" that the winds really start to change. Opening with a haunting clean guitar section, \"Psychopath\" is one of the most sinister sounding songs, and the first on the album where Whitechapel attempt a well written solo. Even if it lasts for only a brief moment, when that solo kicks in, you feel genuine excitement that they are doing something with their guitars other than hacking away at the lowest strings. The last two tracks \"Blacked Out\" and \"Diggs Road\" carry the same energy that \"Psychopath\". Whitechapel borders on sounding more death metal than deathcore on these closers, and closing track \"Diggs Road\" contains some surprisingly melodic guitar parts. Even when the inevitable breakdowns come in, they at least come in at a point in the songs that musically makes sense.\n\nWith the exception of the tracks I mentioned, this is a largely uninteresting effort. Every time Whitechapel come across an idea that works, they don't realize it to it's full potential, preferring to slip into old and annoying habits. Considering the band has three damn guitarists, you would think they would have found a way to take advantage of that and slip into some impressive death-prog territory, rather than using their guitars as percussion instruments. It's clear that each and every member of the band possesses a great deal of talent, from the insane drumming of Ben Harclerode to the growls of Phil Bozeman, and the impressive lead work of Ben Savage (you know, when he actually does break out and shred). Check out the tracks I listed as being the exceptions, avoid reading the lyrics for the sake of your own intelligence (unless you're 16 or don't mind lyrics targeted at angsty 16 year olds) and wait patiently for the day that Whitechapel ditches the tired clich\u00e9s in favor of something new and exciting.\n",
        "\nAnother pile of sonic excrement from these energy drink dispensing corporate rockers (tagged metal for marketing purposes). You'd think with 3 guitar players writing the music they'd stumble on a good idea at some point. Wrong. After a cheesily \"anthemic\" intro, we're greeted with Hatebreed/Slipknot Pro-tools tempo mapped chug-a-longs with hoaky \"we the people\" lyrics sung in an over-processed post-Anselmo monotone voice over basic chord progressions for choruses (of course everything here has radio format structures) that sound like something a radio band like Incubus or Linkin Park would do. How this is even loosely associated with \"death metal\" (sans a rare blast section on select tracks) is beyond me, as much of this is similar to nu-moo rock music.\n\nAngsty lyrics (\"Fuck You\", \"Kill Yourself\", \"You are Nothing\" and various other Korn derived MTV tropes make an appearance) set the stage for what is basically Korn-rock with double bass like Slayer's God Hates Us All without the benefit of having Kerry King's (circa the Goldberg t-shirt years) sense of humor. Most of what is on display here sounds not unlike late 90s angst-groove like Fear Factory or Chimaira: mechanical chugging rhythm grooves and down-tuned bouncy 2 note riffs. Unless you're looking for the successors to Korn's FUBU clad wigger throne, avoid this slop at all cost. At the very least I commend this band on being honest and making it more obvious than ever that they have the same artistic projection as a Fred Durst spearheaded project. The real sin here is that the label who released the eternal Hell Awaits would release this steaming pile of excrement. Avoid.\n",
        "\nDeathcore. Say that word and a lot of metalheads will get shivers down their spine. Truth is, that as with many other genres such as thrash, death, nu-metal, metalcore, whatevercore, there comes a moment when bands need to reinvent themselves and move on, that is what happened during the nineties with most old-school bands. Whitechapel called my attention from the first moment and it was because of that that I was quite anxious to hear something from this new album, as their previous, self-titled record showed them departing from their straight-forward deathcore roots and showing a more mature and atmospheric approach than their previous albums. Did they manage to surprise me? No, they didn't.\n\nThe main problem I have with this album is the regression that is evident in the guitar department. Since their demo times, the guys from Knoxville incorporated three guitarists to their lineup, something that they never took advantage of (in my opinion, of course) In their previous effort, Ben Savage would throw in guitar fills and solos everywhere, as well as some sweet riffs, which in conjunction with the rhythmic work of the band gave as a result interesting and dissonant atmospheres. For their new album, the band chose to switch to djenty riffs and monotonous grooves that are overshadowed by previous works. Another negative aspect about the guitar work is the evident reduction of guitar leads and an increase in the attempts to recreate the atmospheres present in their last album, that sincerely are not as effective as in the release that I have just mentioned. 'The Saw is the Law' is based on a mediocre, average djenty riff made for the annoying hardcore dancers that you meet at gigs of this kind to shake their hands and legs randomly as if they were suffering from a schizophrenic attack. There is a moment when they speed up and throw in a somewhat good riff, but it doesn\u2019t last for long and they go back to being mediocre. 'Mono', 'Let Me Burn', 'How Times Have Changed' trade aggressive riffs and fast tempos for slow and monotonous grooves. They\u2019re three guitarists that showed that they can do more than this, I\u2019d like to see them venture into other territories and go beyond the fifth fret. Fortunately, not all is lost, and after a series of mediocre songs they give us furious assaults in the form of 'Worship the Digital Age', 'Psycopathy' and 'Blacked Out' as if they were saying 'Hey, sorry for so much djenty wankery, here, have these.' They even play some cool leads and tremolo picking riffs! Last but not least we have 'Diggs Road' which arises as one of the most solid songs out of the 10 of them, where they reach an effectiveness level that had been really low or even absent thus far. The guitar melodies during the chorus are nicely done and this time we get two guitar solos! Sadly, three or four songs can\u2019t save an album that is composed of 10, as that is not even half of it. So yes, I was disappointed by the guitar part this time.\n\nNevertheless, not everything about this album is bad. If there\u2019s something that kept me entertained and made me focus on the music all the times I listened to the album, was the drumming, handled by Ben Harclerode. I don\u2019t play drums and I don\u2019t have a drummer\u2019s ear either, so it\u2019s difficult for me to say what are this guy\u2019s influences, but I\u2019m certain of something, and that is that this little man here doesn\u2019t play the same thing two times. Ben\u2019s drumming doesn\u2019t stick to common deathcore and breakdown patterns. Obviously, there are times where he sticks to the guitar rhythm because of a matter of musical coherence, but when not, he completely destroy his kit. Throughout the album, he adds diversity to the various songs thanks to very good grooves and drum fills. The crushing opener 'Our Endless War' never slows down, songs like 'Psycopathy' and 'Blacked Out' show his fast double-bass skills, and others like the latter and 'Worship the Digital Age' feature a nice employment of blast-beats.\n\nTalking about the vocals, Phil Bozeman is a very good vocalist. He dominates each of the techniques he employs quite well, going from his more guttural growls, as can be heard in \u201cWorship the Digital Age\u201d to the fried vocals and shrieks in \u201cBlacked Out\u201d. His vocal range is quite good and you can hear the strength and dedication he puts to sing. Last but not least is Gabe Crisp, who handles bass duties, but the guy is just there. Gabe doesn\u2019t add anything to the music more than his thick bass tone. For example, there\u2019s a break on 'How Times Have Changed' where they attempt to recreate a strange atmosphere where the bass could\u2019ve thrown in a line to compliment the guitar effects rather than leaving them alone. On 'Psycopathy' we can hear it playing something, but unfortunately, it\u2019s a moment in a million. \n\nWhat can I say? The album has some good aspects but they are overshadowed by the bad ones and the mediocre guitar playing. I expected more from these guys. Whitechapel grabbed me by the balls so I was hoping that they would leave infertile this time, but it seems they didn\u2019t have the guts to do it. That being said, it doesn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t like it. Our Endless War is pretty good and I\u2019ve been listening to it a lot lately, but I expected something different. I hope they can do better than this for the next time.\n",
        "\nTry as they might to cultivate a distinct personality with their 5th album Our Endless War, Knoxville deathcore champions Whitechapel seem to repeatedly slug themselves into unconsciousness with a stock set of hybrid deathcore/djent grooves that immediately shit all over the fact that this is otherwise a fairly rounded, patient set of tunes with some genuine notion of songwriting and atmosphere. In fact, this might just be one of the most 'accessible' of deathcore's major league outings to date, with the caveat that they largely avoid the shitty emo pop chorus parts that have crept their way into the niche via its metalcore foster home. I can say that I feel like Whitechapel actually sat back after their last album, their most technical and progressive to its day (and coincidentally the first I liked...if barely) and then came up with the idea to redefine/simplify themselves akin to what Mastodon did with The Hunter, or Metallic did with The Black Album. What I can't say is that I enjoy it, because I do not.\n\nThe bedrock beneath this record is the djent-ish methodology of the guitar tuning and performance, which cycles through a number of tough guy grooves that wouldn't have been out of place on an Emmure record, but that occasionally strike out into a more purely deathcore variety of slamming, or even a spin on some of the neo-thrash we were starting to hear in the later 90s, which took its influence fully from Slayer's garbage phase or Pantera rather than the more inspirational material of the 80s. There are plenty of blast beats and uptempo passages, but these are often affixed with some of the most banal palm mute chugging of their career. The atmospheric melodies, cleaner guitars (as in the intro \"Rise\") or other techniques they mix into the formula might seem a tasty distraction for a few seconds, but inevitably they are drawn through gravity back to the most boring and contrived of riffing sequences possible, almost all of which are irritably familiar and lifted to some slight modification from various hardcore, metalcore and groove metal sources. There are still a few proggy inclinations to how some of the drums pan out (the best part of the album, in my opinion), like how they'll splash some bluesier harmonies over those Meshuggah/Special Defects jazz melodies of yesteryear to create some depth, but this is unfortunately not so compelling as it might have been.\n\nThe guitars have a reliable, stomach punching tone to them which is anchored by the fat but often difficult to notice bass guitar; however, this drummer goes so unerringly ballistic through so much of the 40 minutes here that he seems to leave the remainder of the players in his wakes. Fills flying everywhere, a good rich mix to the toms and kicks, Ben Harclerode is so consummately talented and professional that at the very least, this record could serve as his try-out reel for a far more important band one day. Not that the other players here lag so far behind that they don't deserve some notice, but the creativity of the chugging is unanimously vacant, and Phil Bozeman's vocals are just so vapidly Anselmo-Jasta-HWAAAAHHH that I barely felt the sustained growls trailing off them. Way too 'tough guy', only like so many of these expendable metalcore/deathcore front men, there is no charisma. I'm sure the guy has his demons, they/we all do, but I couldn't pick them out of a lineup of post-Earth Crisis mosh pilots over the course of the last 20 years, and of course I was just so bored by the music that Diamanda Galas singing over it couldn't have made a difference.\n\nBut by far the WORST part of this album would be the lyrics, which are more or less an endless fucking tirade of tired cliches that most angst-ridden tweens pen for their garage bands. 'Just let it go...', 'Fall to your knees', 'Our bodies full of scars', 'This is our way of life'...it's like the songs are all meant to be a part of this Hardcore Self-Affirmation 101 Playbook that aims to justify the band's existence, like it's really them against the world or something, kicking ass on tour and bein' rock stars! No guys, you're not rebels, you play trendy heavy -core music with nary a shred of individuality. Low-hanging fruits plucked from the altar of mediocrity. I'm sure it's all really heart felt (like angina), but what could be more lazy and boring? This album felt so earnestly and desperately bland to me that I almost wonder what I heard in its predecessor, which must have just been a fluke. Our Endless War even looks the part of forgettable, and I think ultimately I liked this one even less than the new Carnifex, which was another step backwards for a potentially promising band. There are exponentially worse albums in this style/these styles, but I sure feel no compulsion to visit this one further.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe Somatic Defilement  is Whitechapel's debut full-length after a signing to Candlelight Records and many local Knoxville shows later, they made an audience for themselves in the ripe year of 2007 where deathcore was just launching itself off. Whitechapel smashed into the scene with this outstanding and dark, dark debut. Focusing its entire concept on the murders committed by Jack the Ripper (heck even the name of the band is named after the district where he did the killings), the record is an audial horror story and the musicianship is a rollercoaster of brutalizing riffs, breakdowns, slams, blast beats, guttural growls (and shrieks) and most importantly; musicianship passion. The band's three guitarist compliment each other perfectly and play each one of their own parts, sometimes even having their own specific sections. \n\nUsually I listen to the album I'm reviewing while I review it, but I am so used to this record down to its very essence, listening to it while only talking about its quality would be unnecessary. \n\nEvery song on this release is totally memorable and I can recite so many lyrics of so many of the songs. Not only have I heard this record well over 90 times, but the songs themselves just feel so right and original to their own kind. If you want a moving piece ending with an enchanting orchastral ending; the title track has that for you, if you desire full on brutal death metal-esque gurgles and shredding riffs provided by tri-guitar force? Throw on \"Devirgination Studies\" or \"Fairy Fay\". If some bits of mathcore influence in your brutal music tickle your fancy, then put on \"Festering Fiesta\". Speaking of that song, by the way, it feels like the band suddenly decided to become fans of Dillinger, but alas even they stated themselves that Blood Has Been Shed is one of their many influences so I can't be surprised a little hint of mathcore could be found. Also another interesting note, I would like to add, the band apparently rips off Between the Buried in Me at 2:27 on the song \"Alone in the Morgue\". By what I discovered, BTBAM actually play this exact part in their song \"Anablephobia\" but with two guitarists and a bassist playing the third note wherein Whitechapel instead play all three notes with their three guitarists. So in all, it's not so much stealing, but I guess taking a part and making it more of their own. Not a bad move at all, just wanted to make note of it. \n\nFinally, I wanna talk about the vocals; this is the album where Phil Bozeman finally makes his big move and his voice is AMAZING. He growls, gurgles and shrieks his way to oblivion truly putting the icing on the cake of an album put around the story of the Jack the Ripper and the absolute utter horror the band displayed the story with. This record could no way be completed without his voice. All the agony, hostility and violence conducted by the lyrics of his growls is brilliance in perfection and that's the best way I can put it. Aside from every other member I've spoke of in the band right now, Kevin Lane's drumming is another thing I want to point out, although his performance is much, much better on This Is Exile, here he plays almost unstoppably good and the production around his kit is almost hand-and-hand beauty. \n\nI would recommend this album to anyone who isn't easily scared away from extreme metal bearing down to the nitty gritty of bands such as Devourment, Bloodbath, Suicide Silence, Carnifex, Suffocation, Job for a Cowboy or The Black Dahlia Murder. This is deathcore at what seems to be its best form (at least to me) not many metal albums do for me what this record has done for me. To me, this album is about as artistic as a high budget film and I couldn't put it any better way. If you thought deathcore couldn't have original pieces or outstanding bands in its genre, you need to think again. This album will always have a special place in my metal collection. \n\n\"And now you rot...\"\n",
        "\nWhitechapel are a band that has garnered mixed reviews over the years due primarily to the fact that they started out as a deathcore band. Their first two albums were firmly routed in that genre before A New Era Of Corruption geared the band up for more of a pure death metal sound. It was by this point that the band's critics were starting to lay off them a little and accept that that particular album was a step in the right direction, with crunchy death metal riffs and a good vocal performance despite some questionable lyrical material. Songs such as Reprogrammed To Hate and The Darkest Day Of Man stand out as some of the best they have put together and Whitechapel finally appeared to have done something right. Until 2012 came and they released their self-titled album which was a complete step backwards and is little more than just another average deathcore album that sticks out like a sore thumb as the worst in their discography.\n\nThe first two songs on the album showed a little promise despite the silly clean vocals from Phil on Hate Creation in which he proclaims \"I'm so sick of all these people\", at least they had some tasty quick riffs and the opening song even has a nice clean introduction that builds up to the mayhem to follow. However these two songs are really bland and do little to build up any form of momentum to carry the album through even one of the terrible songs that are to follow on from it and make them tolerable. Whilst Hate Creation and the stupidly titled Make It Bleed are enjoyable enough numbers despite the breakdowns, they do absolutely nothing for the album on the whole and when the *** hits the fan it really hits the fan. From this point onward there is little merit to be found on the album. Section 8 is the only other song that can actually hold its own as a listenable song due to a couple of meaty riffs that carry it a long way.\n\nThe thing to note about this album is that the breakdowns have been reduced massively in number and that the band has matured a lot as musicians and therefore attempt to disguise the mindless chugging with solos at times. However when they show through without solos or any gimmicks, they are even more devoid of interesting material than the first two albums combined. On This Is Exile the band at least had an element of variety to their riffing and song structures whereas every song on Whitechapel's self-titled fourth album bar the previously mentioned ones have absolutely nothing of merit to them. The riffs are bland tremolo picking with the occasional chord based slower riff found and then the obligatory deathcore open string breakdowns that are even more annoying than on previous albums. Also the band attempt to be clever with their lyrics such as a nod to their previous albums in the opening line of Make It Bleed by saying \"We've been somatically defiled, exiled and now this new era has come to an end\". Phil Bozeman is no poet but this really is taking the piss; this sort of line has no place on any music album anywhere but for some reason he felt the need to scrape it out of the bottom of a shit barrel.\n\nThe drumming lacks a real sense of variety and it just sounds as though the drummer is merely keeping a rhythm whilst the three guitars do nothing but play the exact same riff over and over again over the top of it all, with the occasional shredding solo scattered throughout. This would be alright for a mini EP where at least it would be over in a relatively short time but this is not a short album and it feels even longer due to the lack of variety. Every song except the decent ones mentioned previously just chugs along and does nothing new and never attempts to break out of the mold that Whitechapel are clearly crafting their songs from. They just feel like This Is Exile without any manner of technicality nor and intricate song structures like there was on select songs off of that album. Unfortunately all Whitechapel have done with their latest album is take a massive step back from their past material that was still at least semi-respectable within a select audience of people and make an album that one would have a hard time recommending to anyone whatsoever.\n\nOriginally written for Sputnik.\n",
        "\nSo, Whitechapel's new album has finally rolled around. Nice cover art, guys: the Tennessee state flag's design on top of a saw blade. Inspired! Obviously, that's really the very least of Whitechapel's issues, but as a minor plus side, it's nice to see some qualitative consistency across the album's overall presentation, because goddamn, this suuuuuuuuucks.\n\nWhitechapel have decided right here and right now that they no longer want to be a metal band. That, of course, isn't an insult by itself: it's the manner in which the band decide to go about shedding their metal fa\u00e7ade that leaves such a horrible taste in my mouth. An album like this literally couldn't have been made in any year before 2012, as it took eight full years after the initial deathcore explosion for bands to effectively scrounge up every quasi-metal flavour of the week which flickered around over the past decade, and combine it into such a monument to trendiness as is on display here. Seriously, you name it, this album's got it. Deathcore? Check. \"Atmospheric\" deathcore with stupid little washes of ambient guitars irritatingly floating through the rest of the music, which is clearly too neanderthal-brained to accommodate them? Double check. Djenty alternation between palm mutes and open-note twanging? Gotcha covered there. Nu-metal grooves, and nu-metal whispering, and nu-metal melodramatic breathing, with some horrendously contrived angst to top it all off? Look no further. I have no problems with any of these things on principle, but they mix together here with about as much harmony as a blind chainsaw juggler on a unicycle performing in a daycare centre. The band will shift between literally every idea they could recall at the time, and while the end result isn't exactly what one would call \"spastic\" (which, to that adjective's credit, would make this album a lot more interesting than it currently is), it's incoherent and doesn't carry any unifying theme through any of the songs.\n\nOf course, even if these elements were somehow mixed together in such a fluid and seamless manner that even fans of fucking Gorguts took a minute out of their day to weep in awe of Whitechapel's beautiful compositions, it would be considered somewhat of a prerequisite for said elements to have value in and of themselves, and very few of them even fulfill that criterion. Whitechapel were never stellar or anything at writing breakdowns, but on their two good albums to date, they got the job done and, at the very least, didn't feel like they were there to take up space. The ones on display here are just slow and tedious as fuck; the guitarists don't even try to incorporate melodies into the breakdowns, the rhythms are stale and uninteresting, and the drummer refuses to add in at least a bit of syncopation on the kick pedals or anything else that would spice up the rhythms even a little bit. Whitechapel often attempt to go for the Emmure approach of chaining breakdowns onto breakdowns in order to create what is ideally a never-ending chain of catchiness, but the band fall flat on their face whenever attempting to do this: the breakdowns are only ever linked together in a chronological sense, as opposed to a compositional sense. Throughout the album, bouncy breakdowns bleed into djent grooves which bleed into triplet patterns which suddenly speed up to blast speed because oops our breakdown jam session started to develop a mind of its own. These blastier sections aren't great, and most aren't even good, but as they serve as the album's only respite from base, poorly executed chugging, they almost come across as a positive in regards to the album's quality. If you were to take this stance, I'd like to kindly remind you that Whitechapel's previous albums (even This Is Exile, the awful one) were all stuffed to the brim with blast beats - to settle for less because it's all the album offers you is foolish, especially when most of these blasts are accompanied by simply faster-paced but equally banal chugs or pseudo-technical \"atmospheric\" melodies which are nothing if not totally emotionally sterile.\n\nPhil Bozeman's vocals have surprisingly maintained their quality over the years, and I'd even go so far to say that his high, raspy shrieks have improved, becoming a fair bit more vehement and providing more of a sense of \"carving\" into the music. The new techniques he's adopted, however, certainly tip his scales towards a net loss in overall quality. On this album, Phil Bozeman decides that despite already possessing a perfectly intelligible vocal style, his fans are just itching to hear him recite pieces of his immaturely misanthropic poetry in a method of delivery angsty enough to make Jonathan Davis and Corey Taylor simultaneously make a double take in the general direction of Whitechapel's recording studio. I've never been a fan of spoken word or whispering in my extreme music, but the inherently-awful technique is taken to new extremes here as Phil spews out such timeless gems as \"You bleed, we bleed, what's the point of these lies?\" and \"We don't want you dead. We just want you to feel what it's like to be burned alive.\" Consider yourself talented, Brozeman: you managed to somehow write lyrics so mindless and devoid of inspiration that you got me - the guy who unflinchingly reads the lyrics to \"Pigtails Are for Face Fucking\" and \"Diarrhoea Induced Gag Reflex\", the guy who pays very little attention to lyrics in general and makes a conscious effort to avoid mentioning them in a musical review - to come out of my shell and publicly denounce the crap you have put to paper for this particular musical effort. Feel free to consider yourself singularly abysmal.\n\nNo one wants to or needs to hear this. Listening to this long enough to write a fair review for it, I permanently sacrificed millions of brain cells, 40 IQ points and three inches of my manhood; and were I not endowed with the genitalia of King Kong, you can bet your ass I'd be suing Whitechapel for the damage sustained to my pride and joy after hearing such a pathetic, soul-draining attempt at music. \"The Night Remains\" is probably the only consistently decent song, actually being fast-paced, bouncy, and facetious enough to resemble a poor man's Felony; the rest is Whitechapel's former self having a naughty sleepover with Periphery, Slipknot, and Meshuggah, during which Whitechapel gets gang-raped, tainted by all of the others' filthy, horrendous seed and forced to bear their children. If you see this thing being sold in stores, dramatically break it in half over your knee, and behold as all those around you with even the faintest refinery of musical taste break into an enthused round of applause.\n",
        "\nWhitechapel....Good ol'Whitechapel...is gone! \"The Somatic Defilement\" featured one br00tal moron gurgling, snarling, or whatever he did, over the decent (at times really good) death-metal influenced riffs played by three skilled guitarists. Magnificent drumming was also included and the bass work...well....was good. Their second effort, entitled \"This Is Exile\", features a fucking moron screaming over breakdowns. Magnificent drum-work is gone and the bass-playing...well...it's the same. \n\nI really don't know how to describe this album. It's a fucking abortion, it's a downfall, but.....it has something redeemable, that will make you think \"OK, they are not that bad\". I had a very bad experience listening for the first time to this album. Mainly because the band turned very generic and approached the genre from a commercial point of view (I mean, they made this album for scene kids, who think that Black Veil Brides or Bring Me The Horizon are the best bands in the world). But after the second or third listening, the scene kid in me started to rise up and the album became pretty enjoyable, but still bad. \n\nThere are many wrong things and a handful of good things on this album. First off, the music. The guitars are 80% breakdowns and 20% actual riffs, that can be catalogued as \"pretty decent\". The guitarists never compose passages that require more than 3, maybe 4, strings and they never adventure above the 5th fret. The main reason behind this compositional simplicity is br00tality, which can be done in many other ways. For example, look at Dying Fetus and Behemoth, they use all the strings of the guitar and go far beyond the 5th fret, but still manage to be brutal and heavy as fuck. I never really understood the purpose of the 3rd guitarist. They want to be heavy and brutal or at least leave this impression? There are a ton of ways to sound brutal and heavy (or at least leave this impression), without adding three 7-string guitars to the mix. One way, could be the production. The guitars could have been equalized better, by turning the mid and low buttons a little bit higher, or they could've been higher and louder in the mix (of course, without totally mixing out the drums and the bass). Look at their peers from All Shall Perish. They have a loud production, that enhances the sound of the not-particularly heavy guitars, so that they leave the impression of heaviness and brutality. But the production on this album is so sterile that even the worst band of the world, Waking The Cadaver, manages to be heavier than Whitechapel at times. The only good thing about the guitars are the melodic parts. They use the harmonic minor scale, which gives those parts an exotic, almost oriental feel, like in the title track, where one guitar plays a melodic bit and the other guitars play a breakdown over. I have to admit that all the riffs in \"Possession\" and \"This Is Exile\" are decent and enjoyable. I said the riffs...not the breakdowns.\n\nThe breakdowns are traditional deathcore breakdowns. They are actually one note, usually the low A, played over an odd rhythm. Whitechapel manages (I don't know how) on this opus to create the most generic, shitty, boring and uninteresting breakdowns to ever reach our ears. If it was only one every song or two, it would've been a small issues. But these breakdowns are 80% percent of the music and that's unacceptable.\nA music based on breakdowns is not necessarily a bad music. Dying Fetus, Suffocation and many slam bands (a slam is to an extent a form of breakdown) have a music that is 25%, 50% and sometimes 75% breakdown, but they are not bad bands. They just know how to make a proper breakdown and incorporate it skilfully into their music.\n\nNow the drums...The drummer manages to be heads and shoulders above his bandmates, in terms of skill. He is the best musician in Whitechapel, no doubts, but with the new approach of the genre, his drumming became very generic. He alternates between the horrendous blastfest that plagues every single deathcore song and the slow, groovy, cymbal-driven drumming, mostly present during breakdowns or during slow to mid-paced riffs. The drum-tone changed, from a slam-like tone on the first album to a more polished and sterile one. The snare and the toms sound different, not as raw as on the first album, but as I said more polished and sterile. The only improvement in this department is the cymbal sound. The cymbals sound better than on the first album. \n\nThe bass player is fucking redundant in this band. He is there because the standard death metal line-up comprises two guitarists (in this case three), one bassist, one drummer and one vocalist. I feel very sad for him. He could've been used better on this album, he could've increased the heaviness of the band.......but no, the other fucking morons in this band said that three sterile guitars are better than one nice and meaty bass. By the way, although he was pretty inaudible, in \"Possession\" he has a spot where he plays alone and I could actually hear his bass and the bass production. And it's pretty good, but as I feared....he's totally mixed out.\n\nNow about the vocalist guy. His vocals are very generic and less versatile on this LP. The gutturals (more deathcore, than death metal) are predominant and highs are always layered over the growls, which pretty much sucks, because they don't know how to use layering properly. When done by Vital Remains or Behemoth they sound ok, but when done by Whitechapel they sound pretty much like shit, because you lay one bad vocal part over another bad part and the result is a low-quality thing. His lyrics also worsened. On the previous album, he wrote gory and poetical lyrics. Now, using the vocabulary of a 5-year old boy who just discovered the word \"fuck\", he creates lines that are suitable for the targeted audience, the scene kids, whose brains are washed by the shitty scene music that floods the market today.\n\nI gave this album a 50% rating, because I used to be a scene kid. Now judging from the point of view of a metalhead, I pretty much understand why they did this. In the world today, kids are brainwashed from early childhood by greedy bastards, so they don't know what is bad, and what is good. Whitechapel wanted to make a living out of music, easy and fast. And they turned to scene-oriented deathcore. Good guys, Whitechapel! Now go fuck yourselves and sell albums to morons...*fuckin bastards*.\n",
        "\nYou know, I kind of get the disappointment this album has caused for many scene kids. Yes, Kevin Lane left the band. Yes, there are few death metalish riffs on this album. Yes, the breakdowns sound more like Meshuggah than proper deathcore breakdowns. Yes, Phil Bozeman dares to whisper and speak a few times rather than shout all the time. \n\nSo what? At its core, their self-titled album still sounds like Whitechapel. Ben Harclerode's style is not that different from that of Kevin Lane, it wasn't when he was playing in Knights of the Abyss and it isn't now that he joined Whitechapel. There is still a hell of a lot blastbeats, fast doublebass and whatever you could possibly have wanted from Lane. \n\nWhile the riffing certainly has changed, I find it a lot less average and less typical for deathcore than before. I definitely liked the riffs they had before, but the riffs never really were what set Whitechapel apart from other deathcore bands. The riffs were either pure chugging or standard-issue semi-melodic death metal. What set Whitechapel apart from the pack were the melodic and atmospheric guitar leads that were played over the riffs and breakdowns - and guess what? Those are still there. But this time around, there are actually riffs underlying them, that are creative and that do not sound like those of a thousand other bands. They are even more memorable than before. \n\nThe breakdowns on the other hand, well, they do sound kind of like Meshuggah. But pretty much in the way that any complex breakdown that isn't just standard drop-D mosh sounds like Meshuggah. Whitechapel also manage to make the breakdowns work a lot more like parts of the songs that are actually necessary and make sense. Well, at least more sense than just offering an opportunity to bash somebody's face in at a concert. They carry more melody and atmosphere and really add to the songwriting this time around.\n\nSince Whitechapel also incorporated some quieter parts (see \"Hate Creation\"), I found it simply a necessity that Bozeman expanded his vocal range a little bit. Come on - it's not as if he was doing a Tarja Turunen impression or going all emo on us. He is just adding a bit of spoken word to enhance the atmosphere, that's it. And it works. Just as well as his usual grows have become better once again, the speed at which he delivers his shouts on the aforementioned track and also \"(Cult)uralist\" is nothing short of astonishing.\n\nOverall, I'd say that Whitechapel still stick to their initial deathcore recipe, but they strongly refined the ingredients. The mixture is also still very much typical for the genre - fast riff, breakdown, fast riff, you get the gist. But the single parts simply aren't, yet this helps Whitechapel evolve as much as they possibly could while still sticking to their basic sound and boundaries. As I already said, I do somewhat understand the disappointmend this album has caused in the deathcore \"scene\" for several reasons - but what I do not get is why people seem to be so reluctant to even give it a few spins. It's pretty good, guys.\n",
        "\nExperimentation is a dangerous thing, especially when you are on the top of your game. After Whitechapel\u2019s mediocre 2010 release, A New Era of Corruption, I was skeptical over the band\u2019s future in the deathcore genre (for more details, see my review of their previous full length). I stated that they seemed to be pulling away from their \u201ccore\u201d roots, for a more straightforward death metal sound. Then, in 2011, they released the Recorrupted EP. This featured a new song, Section 8, which was alright. It was just alright, however. It also included a cover of the classic Pantera song \u201cStrength Beyond Strength.\u201d While it was a solid cover, it worried me about what to expect on their upcoming release. The rest of the EP, aside from the interesting acoustic version of \u201cEnd of Flesh\u201d from ANEOC, made me want to vomit. Before this album was released, I went to see Whitechapel on their 2012 headlining tour. They were amazing, which renewed some faith I had lost in the band. Upon the release date, I kept my fingers crossed. \n\nThe album leads off with a light piano medley. While it\u2019s quite relaxing, it doesn\u2019t really serve any significant purpose. Perhaps it\u2019s meant to be the calm before the storm? Around the 35 second mark, the guitars kick in, and what does this sound like? Pantera. We are also blessed with the opening line of \u201cWe've been somatically defiled, exiled, and now this new era has come to an end.\u201d This is obviously referencing their previous albums (2007\u2019s The Somatic Defilement, 2008\u2019s This Is Exile, and the aforementioned 2010\u2019s A New Era of Corruption). Maybe it\u2019s also meant to clarify that they are evolving from their pervious sound? Oh damn, here we go.\n\nPhil Bozeman has always been an idol of mine in terms of both vocal range and writing ability. While their first album was primarily about raping and killing prostitutes, their sophomore and junior albums deal with issues of politics and religion. While they are less amusing, they are something that most of us can relate to. This album\u2019s lyrical content sounds like nothing more than a pissed off, angst-filled teenager. \u201cWe are worthless, you all suck, I will kill you all, blah blah blah.\u201d God, shut the fuck up. We get it. Also, Phil\u2019s diversity as a vocalist is history. He may be trying to change his style, but why would you do that when you are in your prime? In \u201cMake It Bleed\u201d, he sounds like Phil from Pantera and in \u201cHate Creation,\u201d he sounds like Corey Taylor from Slipknot. In \u201cDead Silence,\u201d I don\u2019t know what the fuck he is doing. Are you kidding me? In \u201cHate Creation,\u201d there are even parts when he is talking rather than growling or screaming. I almost shed a tear the first time I heard this. Phil either needs to go back to his older, more unique style of vocals, or he needs to simply go.\n\nI don\u2019t have much to complain about as far as the guitars are concerned, other than the fact that it sounds like these songs were written in about a week\u2019s time. Sure, they are technical and catchy (to an extent), but they lack the intensity that they once had. Also, in some of the songs, you can hardly tell that there are 3 guitarists. In their sophomore album, This Is Exile, there are many guitar parts, particularly in the instrumental tracks, that are both eerie and beautiful all at the same time, which is hard to do. I don\u2019t feel that in this release. The bass is also almost completely inaudible, except for songs like \u201cPossibilities of An Impossible Existence,\u201d which is more of a slower song compared to the rest of the album. I recommend putting away the 8 string guitars, stop ripping off Pantera, Slipknot, and Meshuggah, and go back to what you are not only the most talented at doing, but what you are famous for. \n\nWhen I heard that Kevin Lane, longtime drummer of the band, had left the band, I died a little bit inside. Not only because he was an extremely talented drummer, but because it\u2019s sad to see an original member leave. In the Recorrupted EP, we were given a new song titled \u201cSection 8,\u201d that showcased what their new drummer, former Knights of The Abyss drummer Ben Harclerode, could do. Needless to say, I wasn\u2019t impressed. Sure, he is a very fast player, but so what? Do people really think that that\u2019s all there is to it? Kevin was a very creative and innovative drummer, whereas Ben is simply playing the part. Kevin also had a very simple, quite small setup. However, Ben seems to think it necessary to have an overly excessive setup that is really not necessary. I\u2019m not denying his talent, but he lacks the intensity and passion that Kevin Lane put forth on the previous albums. Kevin stood out, where Ben simply blends into the crowd. \n\nAs a whole, this is not the worst album I\u2019ve ever heard, but it is definitely the worst thing that this six-piece group from Tennessee has ever released. Through all of the rip-offs of various bands, primarily Pantera, this leaves many old school fans disappointed. It may serve some justice to those who oppose this genre in its entirety. However, it is a huge slap in the face to those of us, like myself, who used to idolize Whitechapel as being one of the few deathcore bands that did not fall into the stereotype which has plagued this entire genre of music. They have moved on, and so should their long time fans.\n",
        "\nThere was a time, perhaps less time ago than I'd like it to be, in which I was something of a metalcore creature. Back then, when I was climbing the stairs that would eventually lead me to Testament and Deicide, there was a term that interested me a lot - deathcore. Of course back then I lived mostly based on rumours and I had no idea of what deathcore was apart from All Shall Perish. When, later, I actually decided to use my resources and discover some deathcore music, I wasn't pleased at all with what I was hearing. It felt all too forced and boring. However, there were a few albums which I actually regarded quite well. One of these was (and still is) A New Era of Corruption. \n\nI'm not gonna lie. Most deathcore is horrible, if you ask me. The terrible melding of death metal and metalcore it is know for often consists merely in a huge chain of chuggy breakdowns that make Ko\u042fn sound like a progressive rock band. The drumming is generally unexceptional, which isn't a surprise considering that its main function is to punctuate the breakdowns. The vocals are hit-or-miss and the themes that these bands find to write lyrics are often either childish or ridiculously cryptic (and often meaningless). After having heard Whitechapel's two first albums I wasn't entirely convinced about the band, as some of these elements made a regular presence on their earlier material. However, with A New Era of Corruption, I do think Whitechapel managed to stray away from other deathcore acts.\n\nThe reason for which A New Era of Corruption is so good (for deathcore terms at least) is because the band is obviously avoiding the typical deathcore elements, or at least the most irritating ones, replacing them with more pleasant musical traits that still fit the deathcore moniker, if not completely, at least partially. Instead of composing songs entirely made out of breakdowns, Whitechapel tried to play around with groove. There are even faster-paced sections that play a nod to melodic death metal, and guitar solos. In some way, this is less of a pure deathcore album (like their first two albums) and more of a very heavy groove/n\u00fc-metal album.\n\nThe riffs are nice but they're a bit lukewarm at first if you think that these guys have three guitarists. However, there's always some ear candy under the form of the Pantera/Chimaira-esque flavour of the said riffs. Occasionally the band drops the groove to jump in faster, somewhat more melodic sections (such as in \"Breeding Violence\" around 0:59). There are also guitar solos all over the album, and typical deathcore breakdowns are nearly impossible to find, although metalcorish breakdowns are pretty frequent. The bass is moody, like in the previous releases, making the sound here much darker than in any other deathcore release. The guitar work is close to some sort of groove thrash plagued with n\u00fc-metal elements - which, despite being far from stellar in overall terms, is indeed a triumph in the world of deathcore, which generally makes n\u00fc-metal sound like Bay Area thrash. \n\nThe drumming is not exemplar nor exceptional, but it has indeed been finely played. It varies from a more typical technical groove style to intense blastbeating in the faster sections, as if the drummer wasn't decided between groove thrash drumming and death metal drumming. From a mile of distance, this may be the best drumming I've ever heard in deathcore, and it is superior to most metalcore bands. \n\nThe vocals are quite decent. Phil Bozeman manages to sound like an actual death metal vocalist (very rare in deathcore) and not like a melodic metalcore vocalist (like on most deathcore bands). The pearl of his performance is probably the song \"Reprogrammed to Hate\", arguably the heaviest song of the entire album, where Bozeman showcases a level of aggression never seen before in deathcore, fitting very well the song itself. However, there are also the weaker points (such as in \"Necromechanical\" where Bozeman decides to growl \"I am a machine!\" for half an hour) which stop, rather than inverting, the quality of the material in question. The lyrics are great, focusing on serious themes that everyone can relate to, such as the post-9/11 society (\"Breeding Violence\") or the rise of religious fanatism (\"Prayer of Mockery\").\n\nOverall, it can be said that this is one of the few good albums of a mediocre era. Many deathcore fans disliked it, of course, because it's not a pure deathcore album, but a combination of death metal, hardcore, groove thrash and n\u00fc-metal elements that can be, after the evaluation of the result, called deathcore. This album is recommended to open minded people who may be interested in a deathcore album that doesn't come as an insult to the two genres implied in the term. Not recommended for diehard deathcore kids who are in desire for br00tal breakd0wns and diehard death metal fans who may be displeased by the band's general focus on groove over speed. If you're somewhere in the middle, it won't hurt to give it a listen.\n",
        "\nTennessee's Whitechapel could hardly be called my favorite band in the deathcore spectrum. Not that I spend an inordinate amount of time mining the prospects in that particular strata, but their past output has been more or less a poster child for all the vapid, derivative grooving, shallower hardcore lyrics and uninspired vocal abuse tailor made for little more than teenaged moshing and high school strife. Enter their eponymous fourth full-length Whitechapel, and truth is once being hammered into that age old cliche 'every dog has its day'; for while it still retains some of the traits and flaws that critically marred my appreciation of its forebears, this album prances straight out the gates of the puppy pound and takes a big old, chocolaty dump on my sneaker-boots.\n\nAs with their contemporaries like Carnifex or Job For a Cowboy, I got a real sense from this music that Whitechapel felt an aching desire to expand itself into something more progressive. Evolutionary. Epic. And what I'm hearing from this album translates that intent into some admittedly intelligent and well implemented designs that, while not enough to concoct a masterpiece, are enough to quash its predecessors by an order or so of magnitude. Whitechapel is an album of 'moments' more than a fully-fleshed out experience. There were a good number of palm muted, chugging mosh rhythms strafing both the metalcore and djent genres that I felt ruefully unimpressed with, but where these guys deserve some credit is in how they pepper the aggression with ear sweetening leads, progressive metal leanings and what some might dub 'experimentation'. Not that their earlier albums were entirely void of minor escapes and nuances, but the 38 minute duration of this album is incredibly well balanced between the puerile brutality and something...more.\n\nThat 'more' is, itself, spread among the stars of possibility. You get some calming pianos in the intro to \"Make It Bleed\", before some intense surgical thrashing ensues; or strewn throughout \"Devoid\". There are slight passes at electronica/noise like the intro \"(Cult)uralist\" and \"Section 8\". Though a good portion of the album's grooves are directed at the sort of ballistic timekeeping present on the older albums, they are almost constantly including some little tremolo picked fusion guitar melody or other atmospheric distraction to create a depth that otherwise would have been lost upon the concrete foundation. The grooves themselves are often contrasted between Meshuggah-like jerking and the Earth Crisis/Slayer breakdowns that death- and metalcore were partially hatched from, though you can also experience some aggressive post-hardcore dissonance (check out \"Section 8\" which flirts with all three of these paradigms).\n\nBut more, you're getting a similar taste of the highly technical, modern riffing and soloing inherent to the younger Californian brutal death acts, and they've clearly sharpened their individual musicianship. The band has three guitarists, and they USE them, whether in tripling up the rhythms for a fat, pummeling excess or gauging off dual melodies against the third. The single major setback to the album would be the lyrics and vocals. The latter are decent enough when roving thuggishly along a guttural axis, but the various Deicide snarls and tough guy gang shouts used to complement them are less than complimentary. What's worse, while the music is far more cerebral and stimulating than past jaunts, the lyrics are still held back in that 8th grade hardcore mentality, where the world is all out to get you and you must battle it with the cliched script of social antipathy. Lots of 'lies', 'falling', 'bleeding', and 'fuck' as if I were listening to some second rate wrist-cutter metalcore demo from 1994.\n\nI would LOVE for this band to attempt some poetry, using more interesting symbolism, abstraction, surreality, or even just a more technical vocabulary to streamline with their rhythmic chops. I realize that to some degree these guys are writing for their younger audience, who can appreciate a violent lift-up when he or she has been dumped by society or a significant other, or stabbed in the back by a former 'friend', but as the band ages, I think they should spit some more progressive wisdom in that microphone. But beyond this glaring distraction, I must admit that Whitechapel is entertaining more often than not. You could pull 3-4 songs off this thing in almost any order and come out with a far stronger listening session than the older albums combined. I also like the minimal approach to the cover. The information age, dystopic horrors of the past records weren't bad, and sawblades are nothing necessarily novel, but I like that it doesn't show or tell me anything, it just implies progress. It makes me want to dig deeper.\n\nAll told, this is a vast improvement in most departments. 2012 and the Metal Blade roster is full of surprises. First that Six Feet Under record, and now this? There are probably some Whitechapel fans who will find this less appealing due to its implicit variation, who don't give a shit about hearing the band challenge itself, they just wanna mosh. Plenty of that here for the dude-bros, but honestly, it's high time to grow up: something this Southern sextet has done nicely with this very album. I'll try not to track dog poo all over the rug on my way out the door.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nSo here we have the new self-titled Whitechapel album. The first three are all really awesome pieces of deathcore, so I when I heard the news that they were working on a new record I was stoked. Then they dropped a new song, Hate Creation. It was terrible. Really really bad. There was a part where it sounded like Slipknot, with Phil Bozeman (normally a very capable extreme vocalist) doing his best Corey Taylor impression, complete with lyrics of angsty hatred. Then they released another song called I, Dementia. This was different to Hate Creation. This one wasn't a Slipknot rip off. No, it was a Meshuggah rip off. Non-stop chugging on the 8 string, albeit with an admittedly decent solo. Yes, Whitechapel have made a record that combines nu metal, deathcore and djent, and it unsurprisingly doesn't work.\n\nThe first song begins with a piano intro, before going into a nice riff with Phil name dropping the last 3 albums with the line \"We've been somatically defiled, exiled and now this new era has come to an end\". In a way, he's right. The era of Whitechapel being a good band is over. Now it's time for them to suck. Fortunately, this very song serves as their last decent one. Featuring a neat breakdown with a good build up, an enjoyable solo and some cool harmonies, it makes you feel just for a moment that this album isn't going to suck as much as you thought.\n\nThen you actually hear the rest of the album. Most of this ranges from mediocre to downright terrible. At it's best it just sounds like generic deathcore, which Whitechapel has always managed not to be. At it's worst it sounds like self-titled era Slipknot and everyone knows that's never a good thing, well, everyone except Whitechapel. Sure some of the melodies and solos are pretty cool (as mentioned before, the solo is the only thing saving \"I, Dementia\" from being completely horrible), but everything else is so devoid of originality and creativity. They've never been a particularly original outfit, but they've always had some kind of knack for making really memorable catchy songs while still skillfully avoiding sounding like most other bands in their genre.\n\nI honestly can't see who this CD is appealing to. Hardcore Whitechapel fans will likely hate it for being too different. Maybe the scene kids? No, it's not breakdowny enough. The nu metal kids? No, they're all still posting on forums calling Korn sellouts for experimenting with dubstep. So who does this appeal to? Maybe it doesn't appeal to anyone. Maybe Whitechapel are trolling everyone by making an album for themselves and no-one else. I don't know and at this point I don't care. If you're a fan of the band, don't bother buying or even downloading this, or at least not all of it. Download Make It Bleed and leave it at that. The only other worthwhile track is Section 8, but they already released that last year on that piece of shit cash grab EP.\n",
        "\nWhitechapel, so far, has been very successful in the deathcore scene to thousands of metal heads & scene kids, but in my eyes this is not the best Whitechapel has done. The way this album was planned out was piss-poor in the song tracks & the overall ep. On the album, the band has only fully made one entire song entitled \"Section 8\" & the rest are cover songs, instrumentals, & remixes, which is not what the people want. The people want original songs by the artist.\n\nSince the album \"This Is Exile\", Phil Bozeman's grunts have kind of let up on this ep whereas on \"The Somatic Defilement\" his grunts were at an all time low to where, if he privatly sang for you & you were to sit in front of the amplifier, you would shit yourself. But with this ep and the new one coming out, the quality and brutality of their music is completely gone, and they just can't seem to get that low depth in tone. \n\nSo all in all, \"Recorrupted\" and the new album coming out are 4 and 11 songs of pure dissapointment. It's not the Whitechapel you're used to. My opinion or rate, if you will, is 34%.\n",
        "\nAnd now to album number 3. Whitechapel seem to have finally found the sound they're comfortable with. While the brutal deathcore traces are still there, the band also seem to be taking on a lot of influence from bands like Meshuggah, including bringing in 8 string guitars. They seem to be trying to escape the deathcore label they've had since the start of their career, and they're doing a damn good job of it. This is their furthest album from deathcore. The record isn't stuffed with as many breakdowns, and Phil Bozeman has even stopped dropping \"fuck\", \"shit\" and \"piss\" whenever the band start to play one.\n\nThe riffs aren't those melodic(ish) mid-paced deathcore riffs from before. They're much more groovy and technical. The riffs are a lot slower, without going into non-stop breakdown territory. Imagine a mix between Meshuggah and newer Acacia Strain. There are less solos than on This Is Exile, with the only outstanding one coming on Reprogrammed To Hate.\n\nOnce again, there is little to no bass presence in the music. I really want to hear Gabe Crisp playing some time soon.\n\nPhil Bozeman has almost completely abandoned his incomprehensible gurgles in favor of his mid-ranged grunting. This means you'll hear his lyrics much more often than before. However, this isn't much of a good thing, as his lyrics have hit an all-time low. Some of them are just plain cringe. Guest spots from Deftones's Chino Moreno and Acacia Strain's Vincent Bennett appear on the tracks Reprogrammed To Hate and Murder Sermon, respectively. While Bennett contributes very little, Moreno provides an entire verse of his signature high pitched shriek, before performing a duet of sorts with Phil, where Phil performs a low growl that wouldn't have sounded out of place on \"Somatic Defilement\" to go along with Chino's screeching.\n\nThe drums are impressive, as usual. Blast beats aren't as common, with a lot more polyrhythms to go with the newfound Meshuggah influence. He still knows how to throw in a good old double bass frenzy when he needs to, and the drums are perhaps the best element of this album.\n\nThe biggest problem? The first 5 tracks are the best ones. The band blow their load way too early, and the album takes a huge dip in quality after End of Flesh. You do NOT want to start your album off with the best songs all clumped together. You want the LAST 5 to be the best, or, even more preferable, you want an even mix of the brilliant tracks and the not-so-brilliant tracks.\n\nOverall, it's a good album, but it's far from their best. I'd avoid this until you've listened to at least This Is Exile, which serves as a much better introduction to the band.\n\nHighlights: Devolver, Breeding Violence, The Darkest Day of Man, Reprogrammed To Hate, End of Flesh\n",
        "\nAfter an excellent start in The Somatic Defilement and gaining a pretty large fanbase, Whitechapel used their momentum, signed to Metal Blade Records and began work on a second album. Did the momentum in their favor go to their head and make them sell out and make a commercial deathcore album? Well, yes and no. While easily more accessible than it's predecessor \"The Somatic Defilement\", it's still hardly got mainstream appeal (maybe to scene kids, but slap growls and breakdowns on anything and they'll jump on it). While the sound Whitechapel started with is very much present, they've added a few new parts that work in their favor.\n\nThe band have dropped their heavily brutal death metal influenced riffage in favor of a more melodic tone. This is hardly As I Lay Dying style melodic leads, but they are more melodic than, say, Devourment. There is also a lot of soloing on this album. A common problem with deathcore bands is THEY CAN'T SOLO! This is not the case for Whitechapel. The solos found in songs like Possession and To All That Are Dead are brilliant, and a few more would've really helped the album a lot. There are probably more breakdowns on here than there were on The Somatic Defilement (a lot), but once again, they never use the same one twice.\n\nPhil Bozeman is still a good vocalist, but he doesn't bring anything new. Just more gurgly low growls, mid-ranged grunting and raspy high pitched screams. However, this isn't a bad thing, as he still sounds incredible and unique, and his higher vocals have improved a lot from the last album. His lyrics have also got worse (\"Subconciously, I am aroused\"), and there's a lot more random outbursts of \"FUCK!\" That might sound cool to a scene kid who thinks \"omfg he said fuck! so hardcore!\" but it sounds a bit childish, really.\n\nGuy Kozowyk from The Red Chord also pops up on Exalt. He makes a good change from Phil's grunts and screams for all of two lines.\n\nNo bass. Again. Poor Gabe. He must be upset about getting mixed out all the time.\n\nThe drums, once again, are excellent. The blasts are fast, the fills are expertly done, the breakdowns are groovy, the tone is great. The drums are just exactly what you need from drums on an album. A perfect rhythm with lots of tempo changes and fast parts.\n\nThe album also contains some bits between tracks where a distorted demonic voice is heard. I have no idea what it's supposed to represent, but it doesn't last long and really only serves as brief interludes. The final track also contains an ambient section that lasts most of the song, before going back to the Whitechapel sound with Phil growling \"I AM THE END!\" over and over, as low as he can. A great end to a great album.\n\nThe flaws? Apart from the lack of bass, poor lyrics and the shortage of great solos, the second-to-last track Of Legions is VERY unnecessary. Consisting of a slow build-up and a bunch of spacey sound effects before a mediocre breakdown that lasts the entirety of the rest of the track. It's just not really good enough to be there, even if it does fade into closer Messiahbolical and shouldn't have been included.\n\nHighlights: Father of Lies, Possession, Eternal Refuge, Messiahbolical, Somatically Incorrect\n",
        "\nWhitechapel are probably the biggest band in deathcore right now, and with good reason. They're excellent! Their sound has undergone a few changes since their formation, while still staying true to the deathcore sound. Apart from a couple demos nobody cares about it started with this. A brilliant combination of brutal death metal and deathcore.\n\nThe first thing we hear is an intro with an excerpt of an interview with Jeffrey Dahmer. Serial killer samples are an obsession with brutal death metal/deathcore bands, and Whitechapel prove no different. Despite the useless intro, the album kicks off to a good start, with Phil Bozeman letting out not one, but TWO insanely low growls, with Kevin Lane showing us his blasts.\n\nThe guitar work on this release (played by 3 guitarists) is a mix of crushing breakdowns and faster and at times slightly melodic riffs. The fact there are 3 guitarists is never really shown, apart from the triple harmonised breakdown towards the end of Alone In The Morgue. This album is stuffed with breakdowns and they are very typical of the genre. Nothing you haven't heard before. However, you won't have heard it in the track before. Every breakdown in this release has small but noticeable differences. Most deathcore bands seem content with just using the same breakdown 32 times an album (Chelsea Grin), but Whitechapel know not to do this.\n\nNo bass. Not once.\n\nPhil Bozeman is a monster vocalist. His growls are sickeningly low. However, his high vocals are pretty unspectacular, but thankfully he doesn't use them too much. His lyrics are pretty gory and violent, especially for a deathcore band. He uses some degree of medical terminology that would make Jeffrey Walker proud. However, he uses words like \"fuck\" and \"shit\" quite a lot, which is a shame, because the rest indicate he's a much more capable lyricist.\n\nThe drums are pretty much non-stop triggered to fuckery blast beats, but Kevin Lane still knows to use perfect fills during the breakdowns to stop them getting boring. The production even saves the drums from sounding sterile and lifeless. They genuinely have a heavy tone rather than just \"click click click\" over and over.\n\nOverall, a brilliant start for one of deathcore and extreme metal in general's best bands. Get this if you like your deathcore with a fuckton of slam/brutal death metal influence.\n",
        "\nThere is certainly no love lost between myself and anything this Tennessee deathcore act has released to date, and with their new stopover EP, Recorrupted, I'm afraid the abject loathing must continue. This is not something meant to be so seriously, as it largely features remixes and a cover song, but regardless I found it to be weaksauce to the nth degree. A disheveled and disjointed teaser for whatever the band is planning next in the full-length realm, straight from the vaults of Metal Blade, who always seem to ply their fingers along the genuine, trendy pulse of extreme music.\n\nIn fairness, there are some elements to the sole new original track that, \"Section 8\" that I was not completely turned off by. After the obligatory ambient/electro lead-in we get a huge, guttural growl that heralds a multi-layered mesh of pumping djent grooves, dissonant industrial metal dressing and droning air raid picking melody. But within the span of a minute, we've already relapsed into some boring drudge of muted groove chugs which bounce along like faux dreadlocks at a Korn gig, pants so baggy that even when they jump da fuc up they're still dragging on the discarded butts, rolling papers and abandoned gig flyers. There is a particular, mechanical resonance that Whitechapel graft to this song that I thought showed some promise, and a nice dual lead melody that slices through its midsection like a plastic surgeon curbing a midriff, but in general I found that there were no memorable riffs throughout, it just sort of bludgeons along into its own grooving oblivion.\n\nHey, at least it's better than everything else on this EP... The cover of Pantera's \"Strength Beyond Strength\" manages to make the tracks inherent, ball-fisted mosh break into something dull and methodical. The 'Big Chocolate remix' of \"Breeding Violence\" seems as hackneyed as a lot of those old Fear Factory techno mixes. Lots of distorted, yawning Skrillex-like aesthetics and some noodling guitar melodies applied for texture. The Ben Weiman remix of \"This is Exile\" is mildly less annoying, as it takes a more mathematical application, but it feels like something Justin Broadrick would have left on the cutting room floor rather than add to some Godflesh compilation. And lastly, the Tennessee boys show their sensitive side, with an acoustic rendition of \"End of Flesh\" (these are all from their most recent album A New Era of Corruption). This is instrumental, and not bad as background noise, but neither is it remotely compelling.\n\nRecorrupted is really just a bunch of odds and ends being used to tide over the deathcore fan, and many such releases (in all genres) aren't fit to scrape your boots with. I admit that I would not mind hearing Whitechapel drift further into the mechanistic industrial grooving space with their own writing on the next album, but I think it's time they ditched some of their more dull chugging breakdown sequences and attempted to vary up the vocals a bit, since they too seem like a pastiche of the trite and generic that no one will care about in a decade. Maybe a year. At any rate, I've no inbred opposition to deathcore and its variants if done well. Job for a Cowboy and even Carnifex have surprised me in the past, but I've yet to be impressed by this crew, though I can hear some latent potential slumbering inside them like a kraken on its murky leash.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI never thought I'd see a metal album composed of a bunch of alternative versions of songs, but being a rather mainstream deathcore band, I suppose it's only natural that Whitechapel step up to the plate. Well, it wasn't as terrible as I expected - the remixes feel like a bit of a waste, but the rest of the material seems to make up for it.\n\nI'll spend a bit more time on \"Section 8\", since considering it's the only new material the band has written since their last full-length, it's likely a hint at their future in terms of song structure and whatnot. Well, honestly, I think this is probably the least progression Whitechapel have ever made between releases - This Is Exile was much more melodic and more typically deathcore-ish than The Somatic Defilement, and A New Era of Corruption saw the band abandoning this more wimpy edge in favor of a more mechanical, djenty guitar tone and a chugging style of rhythm not too far off from Emmure's later works. Here, however, not much has changed from the last release: the guitars are still weird chugging, the guitar tone is practically identical. I mean, Phil's vocals continue to improve, becoming increasingly more fleshed out and pissed than before; the production job's thicker and bassier; and I suppose one could make the argument that the band's sound is becoming a bit more synthetic and, well, djenty; but overall this is the exact same Whitechapel I listened to 18 months ago. Despite being an inconsistent album, I enjoyed the basic premise of A New Era of Corruption; and while I would admittedly let the band get away with making two identical records if one perfected the sound laid out by the previous album, the band appears to be making more problems for themselves than solving any. \"Section 8\" doesn't carry its rhythm very well, occasionally stopping perfectly decent chugs and blast sections to devolve into the deathcore equivalent of a war march riff for no apparent reason. I mean, the intro riff is catchy as hell, and could have easily carried the band through four minutes of material, but instead they break it up and each time they make the song start all over in terms of building up a sense of progression. I know it's a bit cynical to make predictions on the band's future career based on one song, but fuck, the band had a whole year to write one goddamn song and quite a few bands can write a solid album in that amount of time. No excuses.\n\nThe Pantera cover is the highlight of the EP, by far. \"Strength Beyond Strength\" isn't really a song I enjoy that much, but being a deathcore band halfway to being Emmure anyways, Whitechapel predictably turns it into an absolute monster. The main riff is downtuned as hell (the resulting mix of hardcore/groove song structure and deathcore guitar techniques unmistakably sounds like The Acacia Strain) and turns the original song from \"slightly angsty\" to \"something people high on PCP play while punching in walls\". Phil Bozeman's vocals help this particular song much more than Phil Anselmo ever could have - a clear, intelligible, yet ridiculously low mix between a growl and a yell seems to do this song more justice than the original. The breakdown is - duh - heavy as shit, the song carries itself perfectly, and overall it's absolutely amazing. Despite the general taboo associated with the following statement, I'd say this blows the original out of the water. \n\nThe remixes are...well, they're remixes. I'm not going to try to tell you what genre they are, because I have fuck's worth of a clue, but I knowing his musical background I probably wouldn't be wrong if I took a guess at Big Chocolate's remix being a dubstep song. It's quite middle-of-the-road - I believe it's trying to be catchy, but that's the thing - you're remixing a deathcore song. It would be like hearing a Candlemass song and thinking \"Gee, what if I made this SAD?\" It's redundant and never goes well. Like many of Big Chocolate's remixes, it's basically the same song with some weird reverb floating throughout. The synths in the back half of the remix do make the song very different, and almost give it a Lykathea Aflame-esque vibe, but overall this is a pretty useless remix. Why couldn't he remix one of the less inherently chuggy songs, like \"The Darkest Day of Man\"? Ben Weinman's remix of \"This Is Exile\" isn't any better - it spends almost a third of its length on an intro that has no context within the song whatsoever. In addition, the beats are much more repetitive, and while they feature a more creative use of samples from the song it doesn't really redeem it from the fact that there are only three different riffs from the song used in this remix. Add that to the fact that the bass - the testicles of pretty much every deathcore song ever - is quite glaringly cut from this song, and the remix isn't of much worth at all.\n\nFinally, an instrumental acoustic of a song off of the last album. I personally thought \"End of Flesh\" was one of the more overlooked songs on that album - it was probably the best choice for an acoustic, considering it's one of the only ones that had some melody besides distorted semitone chugs. This version almost begins to sound like a completely different song, though the basic melody is noticeable in quite a few places. It's an interesting take on the song for sure, and it's somehow pleasing to know that every now and then the guitarists are capable of something besides simple breakdowns. Quite worth it.\n\nSo... two great songs and three okay songs. I feel like I enjoy this a lot more on a personal level compared to a statistical one. Worth a purchase, I suppose, if you want a strange grab bag of deathcore songs.\n",
        "\nThe way Metal Blade continue to churn out deathcore bands these days reminds me somewhat of the way Roadrunner had a production line of Nu Metal wannabes throughout the mid-nineties. Not that Whitechapel are comparable musically to Coal Chamber of course, far from it - thank fuck. I never quite understood the hatred that Job for a Cowboy got from internet bitchers, apart from the fact that they seemed to exemplify a lot of what is wrong with commercial end of extreme metal nowadays, they seemed like a fairly proficient death metal band to me. However, with hundreds of bands jumping on the bandwagon, I can see that this new metal fad will undoubtedly get extremely tiresome sooner rather than later. I mean, c\u2019mon \u2013 check out the font that Whitechapel use on their band logo \u2013 it\u2019s almost identical to Job for a Cowboys. They could\u2019ve at least tried to be a little bit original! \n\nSo, let\u2019s see what we have here. Perfect production? Check. Breakdowns aplenty? Check. Can\u2019t decide whether they want to be Suffocation or Hatebreed? Check. Generic? Naturally. OK, so perhaps I\u2019m being a little harsh, but Whitechapel really don\u2019t do much for me at all. There are the occasional interesting pieces of riff interplay, or crushing Dying Fetus-like riff breakdown \u2013 but they just end up getting coupled with downtuned \u2018chugga chugga\u2019 crap that really ruins songs for me. Fear Factory did that 10 years ago, there\u2019s no need to dig it up again now and couple it with death metal. There\u2019s even a few nods toward At the Gates in the more melodic sections you\u2019ll be surprised to hear too(!). The best thing about Whitechapel are the vocals for me, with Phil Bozeman\u2019s range reminding me a lot of Svencho of Aborted, so if that\u2019s your cup of tea, you\u2019ll probably dig this guy too. \n\nThe main word that sums this album up for me is \u2018sterile\u2019. It\u2019s the metal equivalent of pre-packed meat. Perfectly cut into shape via pro-tools, sitting on its clean polystyrene tray of production, ready for sale on a mass scale. Yes, it\u2019s got its brutal points, but it\u2019s not brutal in the true death metal sense of the word. It\u2019s just missing teeth for me, which is kind of like watching a Rocky film with all the fight scenes cut out. Good enough, but there\u2019s scarier, uglier and dare I say it\u2026 more interesting stuff out there. Boring.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalteamuk.net/\n",
        "\nI have to say This Is Exile did not fail to satisfy my metal needs. Even though it was kind of generic, I would take it anyday instead of this. I'm glad Whitechapel decided to move forward and leave their generic scene metal roots behind, but I'm pretty sure they were aiming directly to the mall when they forged this lame breakdownpallooza that has very little (if at all) death metal moments. This is The Somatic Defilement by Whitechapel. \n\nLyrically it's plagued with sadistic and gory elements that might remind you of Carcass or Hemorrhage and make you think they really took the time to compose these fantasy gore worshiping death metal lyrics. Also Phil Bozeman knows how to enunciate the words without going all ''grrrrrr'', and his voice doesn't sound bad at all, so this aspect is very acceptable. The only bad thins is how whiny the high pitched vocals sound. \n\nNow, let us jump to the guitar part. Or should I say breakdown part? Yes, perfect for those moshpit kids who don't give a flying fuck about the music with low tuning and poorly executed palm muted riffs. In other words, ''chug chug chug''. They almost remind me of Thy Art Is Murder's ''Infinite Death'', being bland, generic and trendy. Musically, Whitechapel didn't put too much effort elaborating this album and instead decided to throw some random guitar leads here and there just to create the illusion of being a death metal band. Fairy Fay makes you think the song will be some punishing death metal when it starts, but after a couple of seconds more breakdowns come in, completely destroying the atmosphere.\n\nBass... completely unaudible.\n\nI guess since they were just beggining and this is their very first official release, their drummer wasn't that good. You can tell by the sloppy double bass and the sloppier drum fills and chops. Just take your typical Job For A Cowboy song and take out the drummer's triggers. That's how bad they sound. Perhaps the best part is the whole album's intro. No guitars, no bas. All you can hear is blast beating while some guy describes how is it to preserve someone forever even if it's just a part of it. \n\nOverall this is no different from other hundreds of deathcore acts out there. I gave them 15% because of how clever the intro was.\n",
        "\nIt's albums like this that make my hate for deathcore decrease a lot even to the point where This Is Exile is played in my iPod at least once a day. You can tell these guys know what they're doing and seriously have lots of talent when you blast this album at full volume. \n\nThis Is Exile might be their best release so far, flooding your ears with both melodic guitar passages and brutal death metal chugs in a very low tuning, but unlike other deathcore bands, these guys know how to keep it crunchy and aggressive without using excessive breakdowns or boring dissonant chugga chugga fests. This album sounds very understandable and clean (not clean as in computerized fl studio-ish sound but rather clean as Lamb Of God), so you won't miss any of their riffs, drum fills, solos or even the bass-line, even with Phil Bozeman's never stopping vocals. \n\nPhil Bozeman's vocals are certainly not unique but they're not bad at all. He sure knows how to growl and enunciate the words properly at the same time, and very fast as well. He's no Corpsegrinder but still sounds brutal and will make you love this album even more everytime you hear it. The only bummer i found is the fact that the lyrics are kind of mediocre. They try too hard to be philosophical/satanic/intellectual and yet end up using ''fuck'' so many times that you'll almost think their lyricist was Corey Taylor from Slipknot. The fact that the word ''fuck'' is used to many times makes the lyrical content much less aggressive and very childish. I wouldn't mind it this was some kind of parody or if they would've done this for the sake of being funny, but since the album concept is supposed to be serious and epic, it kind of ruins the whole atmosphere. Oh well, nothing too bad since, again, Phil's Vocals sound pretty awesome in most of the songs. \n\nThe bass is almost inexistent as you can barely hear it except for a couple of melodic fills such as in Possession, so there's nothing much to talk about their bassist. The bass pretty much follows the guitars melody all the time so don't expect Cryptopsy-like bass parts or anything Slaughterbox would play. \n\nA standars is one of my favorite tunings in metal, and these guys knew how to use it with their 3 guitarists. That's right, 3 guitars. That doesn't mean it's over the top heavy or a savage wall of noise. in fact I've heard bands that sound heavier with just one. The real purpose of having so many guitarists is to keep the ghastly atmosphere at all times and in some occasions to make it even ghastlier with ghost-like leads mixed with brilliant heavy guitar passages. Basically, one guitar can play palm muted guitar riffs while the other two play phantasmal leads (Death Becomes Him comes to my mind). So overall, the 3 guitarists do their job perfectly and make your head band most of the times. \n\nEven though the drumming incorporated in this album is nothing unique or special, the sound of the drum kit is very solid and keeps up with the riffs and the vocals at all times, specially the bass drum; I like how the bass drum sounds like a click and yet manages to add its part as a bass drum, creating a very equilibrated clean sound, unlike many bands who either just go for the lowest drum bass sound and bury its sound below all the instruments or go for the ''clickier'' sound and make it sound like a computer mouse click. \n\nNow, without any kind of rant intended, let me talk about their most despicable aspect for most metallers. The ''breakdowns''. Of course, most of deathcore breakdowns sound ridiculously boring, but just try not to think about Bring Me The Horizon when you listen to this album, instead think about Suffocation. This Is Exile has indeed several breakdowns, but not in the vein of karate-kid temper tantrum dance breakdowns you might be thinking about. Possession, This Is Exile and Messiahbolical (my personal favorite) incorporate these slow tempo breaking down parts in a very enjoyable and catchy way. Of course, their best parts are when they play fast and brutal Bloodbath-esque death metal riffs, but the breakdowns are not that disappointing either. \n\nThe only real flaw I found is the old school hardcore chorus that they use in Messiahbolical. I know I said it's my personal favorite, but I can't help it but laugh everytime I hear the whole band yelling ''this is what... we've become!''. Those kind of vocals only sound good when you play hardcore punk, thrash or crossover, you know, something political and against the system. When you use them in something that's supposed to be demonic and obscure, it's just hilarious and pointless. \n\nIf you are willing to accept and enjoy their ''core'' passages, you will not repent for getting this album. It's not that brutal or that heavy, hell, it's no Condemned or Nile but you should still get your hands on this release.\n",
        "\nRecently, I decided to check out many deathcore bands a friend of mine recommended. Along those bands, I listened to I Declare War, Fallujah, Impending Doom, Oceano, Job For a Cowboy and Whitechapel. Except for JFAC (which were the worst), all the bands sounded like exact clones. They don't sound similar, they sound IDENTICAL. So did this album.\n\nIt's not that it sounds bad. It's just that, well, it sounds too forced. Some of the songs stand out and manage to get stuck in your head like ''breeding violence'' or ''the darkest day of man'' (the best song from the album). All the instruments sound perfectly arranged, with audible vocals. The main problem is that the whole thing doesn't sound original at all.\n\nSome claim this is the new sound of metal today, but it actually sounds like watered down, ultra soft brutal death metal. This is actually very ''br00tal'' (or ''brewtl''), perfect for your average scene guy who just got into metal last thursday. However, this sounds very bland and lacks something that makes me headbang or want to mosh, in the same vein as Slipknot or Korn, only with more breakdowns and even cleaner production.\n\nWhat I can tell from what I've listened Whitechapel (pretty much all their albums, being ''This is exile'' the most decent one) is that they have always sounded generic and manufactured, and unfortunately with this release they made no exception. C'mon people, metal is not just breakdowns or playing downtuned guitars.\n\nMusic goes like this. Pretty much the whole album is made with chugging guitar riffs, half-assed guitar solos and computer sounding drums. Some songs manage to be very catchy. ''Darkest day of man'' is very appealing, incorporating decent guitars with good vocals courtesy of Phil Bozeman (a true god for teenager kids who want to be ''vokillists'') and some interesting lyrics. Same with ''breeding violence'' and ''reprogrammed to hate'', which create a dark atmosphere, straight from the darkest corner of your local mall. It doesn't mean it's bad, it's just very teenager oriented. Also it's very important to mention the bass is, as expected, unaudible. The deep sound is there, the low sounding guitar is doing its job, but it doesn't stand out, it's just there. \n\nNow for the lyrical contentm here's an example:\n\nHow the fuck could anyone believe the truth\nWhen the religious fools have endless prophecies\nBring it all down to an end\nI find it amusing when you think it all makes sense\nI have the solution\nBring it all down to an end\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I find the use of curse words very childish, as it makes the music much less aggressive. Might as well just apply the Slipknot formula of fucking-shit-motha-fucka.\n\nIt's still entertaining and somehow tolerable, just like the bands I mentioned before. But after a while it gets really boring, since you heard the same thing thousands of times before.\n",
        "\nWhitechapel are the creators of one of my favorite albums of all time, and as such I keep a close eye on them. I was very disappointed with their 2008 album This Is Exile, so I was hoping this album would be a return to roots. I wasn't even close in my prediction, but on the other hand, I do enjoy this album...though it's not the album I wish it was.\n\nAs the latest trend seems to be, Whitechapel have come to the conclusion that deathcore is a dying genre, and as a result have created an album that is essentially a death metal album struggling to let go of the deathcore genre entirely, and only half-succeeding. However, unlike Carnifex's and Job for a Cowboy's death metal transition albums, this one succeeds in that it not only eliminates most of the deathcore influence, but at the same time doesn't sound boring or confused in its direction or presentation.\n\nThe album's most prominent change from Whitechapel's older work is the new guitar direction. It is much heavier and grooving than the band's older guitar sound, and there is a lot more emphasis on the slower side of the guitars. The majority of the guitar work is rhythmic chugging, which is just about the only thing that still serves to identify Whitechapel as a deathcore band. There aren't really any fast parts on the album; as I've said, there is a lot of chugging. For the people who dislike deathcore, however, you'll be happy to know that there aren't any true breakdowns on the album at all. The album also incorporates many more melodic sections than Whitechapel's older works, and they dominate the songs \"End of Flesh\", \"A Future Corrupt\", and \"Prayer of Mockery\", as well as the chorus of \"Devolver\". You'll also find guitar solos in a few of the songs, such as \"Reprogrammed to Hate\", but they feel generic and boring, feeling more like bad extensions of the melodic leads than solos. The bass guitar is sometimes audible through the blasting of the three guitars, but not often.\n\nPhil Bozeman has improved his vocals from This Is Exile, which is no small feat, given he was the only member giving it his all on that album. As he has stated in interviews, his main goal here was to use more diction to make his lyrics more interpretable, and it has definitely worked. You can understand a large majority of the words without looking in the lyrics book at all, and at the same time his voice is more guttural than it was on the previous album. The vocal execution is also very forceful (read: not forced), and he delivers the lines with extreme vehemence. Check out the emotion in the chorus to \"Reprogrammed to Hate\", his shouts of \"WELCOME TO HELL\" in \"Devolver\", or my personal favorite, the halt of the instruments at 0:28 in \"The Darkest Day of Man\". His highs, on the other hand, haven't improved much at all, if improved they truly have. They have a bit more emotion added to them, probably because of the added diction, but I still dislike the overall presentation of the vocals because I've always enjoyed Phil's emotionless screams in the past two albums.\n\nAnd that leaves the drummer. An odd thing about Whitechapel's drummer on this album is that even though the guitars are chugging at a relatively slow speed, the drummer uses blast beats and variants almost constantly to give the music an illusion of speed. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't, and it simply feels like the guitars and drums are completely out of tempo. The kit's sound itself is quite watered down by the guitars, which were probably intended to take front and center on this album. Fair enough, since they're probably the shining element of this album, but the end result feels a bit lacking due to the partial tuning-out of the drummer. \n\nAs with the last album, lyrics are a weak point on this album. The actual vocal execution is great, yes - but the words Phil is saying are all repetitive rants on religion that just feel pretty stupid. It's almost like a sixth grader decided to be an atheist because all of his peers were, and then wrote some second-rate poetry about how much God sucked. Now, mind you, I have no predispositional problem with lyrics dealing with any religion, but fuck, at least try to make them sound intelligent. The only reason you'd try to tell someone your opinion on religion through music is to sway their opinion, so don't make it appear that people who believe what you do are all morons.\n\nThis is a great improvement over This Is Exile - though that in itself isn't saying much - but at the same time, Whitechapel doesn't seem to have any plans to return to the stellar formula they created with The Somatic Defilement. I doubt that Whitechapel will ever return to their former greatness going down this path, but that being said, this is a good album, especially for a death metal hybrid.\n",
        "\nContrary to how my feelings on most of its primary progenitors' works might cast a gloom upon the deathcore genre as a whole, I'm not internally opposed to the idea. The idea that breakdowns, youth mosh attitude and other key characteristics to hardcore or metalcore could be incorporated into death metal music is hardly a long shot. Death metal and its own parent genre thrash were loaded with such things already, just...better. Deathcore seems a fairly natural successor to metalcore and its elder sibling, crossover, but the fact stands that so few artists within its confines have written anything even remotely compelling. In fact, it's sadly telling that some of the best albums in this category (like Job for a Cowboy's surprising 2007 album Genesis) are merely those that bark as straight up the pure death metal tree as possible.\n\nWhitechapel are not an entirely talentless bunch of guys, but the stamp of quality evades them once again with their third album, and second through Metal Blade: A New Era of Corruption. This is still the same chugging three guitar onslaught you heard on their prior releases, but the content itself seems to fall well between its predecessors in both quality and style, leaning towards the mosh slop of the debut with an added meat injection of math like, bouncing grooves ala Meshuggah or other djent acts. The vocals are still pretty bleak, at best sounding like Vader or mid-period Morbid Angel, but usually just a palette of scrappy tough guy deathcore with snarls interchanged like a street youth approximation of a Deicide or Carcass. The tones are rich and thick here like any modern extreme metal album, and no expense was spared, but the actual writing falls far behind the band's impetus to craft mere mosh anthems for disheveled youth who will forget all about it six months hence, and they don't temper them with what seems like any real steel whatsoever...\n\nTake a track like \"The Darkest Day of Man\", which at its apex transforms into simplistic, thrash propulsion rhythms that reminisce to the groovier elements of Swedish melodic death aspirants (err, clones) like Black Dahlia Murder, but is otherwise a bunch of tightly wound, bouncing and slamming downtuned grooves that go nowhere musically. It seems like the process on this album is to shift through a number of brickhouse dynamics without ever really pondering the riffs that could transform them into something terrifying or effective. A New Era of Corruption feels like going through all too many motions. It's mechanical and precise, but if I didn't know any better I'd say it felt like the Tennessee band were bored with this. Whereas the predecessor had slight hints of inspiration, this is pretty much all blood and sweat channeled into meaty chug rhythms (\"Reprogrammed to Hate\", \"Prayer of Mockery\", \"Murder Sermon\") that seem to survive only on how many kids start dancing to them. There are riffs spotting this muted landscape, but they rarely catch the ear for more than a fleeting second, and are all too quickly evaporated into mindless slogging punishment.\n\nIf you woke up this morning and decided you'd just like to do barrel rolls and lawnmower kicks down the main boulevard of your city neighborhood, then Whitechapel provides an ample soundtrack to your quick fits of violence. But the memory of such a spree is guaranteed not to endure beyond the possible manslaughter charges. This might be the best produced of the band's albums, and the lyrics maintain the more hardcore, thoughtful essence of their sophomore rather than the perverse pleasures of the debut, and Phil Bozeman's vox might actually sound a little more gruff and brutalized, but none of these traits necessarily translates into quality music, and I'm yet again striving to find the appeal. You can almost randomly select a modern brutal death metal record at large and find more appealing, interesting content, and certainly the 'core side of the equation, which here manifests through the prevalence of palm muted breakdowns, is truly void of the ideas that made for successful stylistic marriages in the past.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nTransferring from their deal with Siege of Amida/Candlelight over to Metal Blade, the more secure home of fellow deathcore mavens Job for a Cowboy, Whitechapel returned to the millstone to churn out their sophomore This is Exile the year after their debut hit the shelves and ipods of cool kids everywhere, and its contents hit and bruised the pretty faces of many an anguished youth during the band's breakdown centric live performances. This time, no expense was spared, as the band commissioned some better artwork and had the album recorded and mastered in New England, the latter job handled by the infamous metalcore production guru Zeuss out in western Massachusetts.\n\nConsidering this, the result is pretty astonishingly similar to the debut album, with perhaps a larger flair for melodic death metal running in currents through the band's brickhouse chug off breakdowns. Some added technicality is to be expected, and thus the album is busier overall, what with the band keeping their three guitar approach to composition (that is really only felt in the leaden bottom end and full rhythm segments behind the breakaway melodies), but it still feels like a mix of the same mosh core and trendy melodic death, with vocals that once again conjure up a mix of Vader, Behemoth or Morbid Angel guttural aggression with the layered on snarls you expect from a lot of modern brutal death. The breakdowns are here, still, and very rarely any good, tending to leech away the bursts of the title track or \"Exalt\", the latter of which has some decent little lead licks and atmospheric touches that disappear into a wall of fist fucking djent fury.\n\nOne area in which the band have clearly improved is in the lyrics. No more will you find the sadistic sexual surgery of the debut. The band seem to have moved on to higher brow concepts like sacrilege and undead social rebellion. Granted, they can hardly be dubbed 'poetic' or even all that interesting, but it seems a little more fitting to the band's aural aesthetic. The mix here is brighter and bloodier than the debut, and perhaps more welcoming since the band have upped their melodic ante considerably. Ultimately, I feel like This is Exile is a slight step up from The Somatic Defilement. It's more thoughtful, but still pretty frustrating, with the best track being a 3 minute melodic chugging instrumental... (\"Death Becomes Him\") and almost everything else flipping its lid between forgettable thrusting rhythms, semi-tech showmanship and trendy beat downs. This is one dance partner you're not going to remember in the morning, regardless of what venereal ailment you've picked up.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhitechapel is one of the three major acts in the contemporary 'deathcore' genre here in the US, which, depending on which side of the 15 year old age barrier you fall, is either one of the most exciting or dreadful trends in all of extreme music. Not as fashionable as California's Carnifex, nor as evolutionary and intense as Arizona's Job for a Cowboy (on a good day), they seem to represent a more blue collar approach to the popular medium. Alas, this doesn't really translate into anything interesting musically, because the Knoxville brutes make most of the same mistakes as many of their less interesting peers, while adding nothing to the table that we weren't already sick of when metalcore turned from its waking, esoteric promise to insufferable pop inflected trash.\n\nThe Somatic Defilement seems to operate heavily around some of the most generic breakdowns the human mind can conceive. Breakdowns that were dated even as a seminal band like Earth Crisis or Hatebreed were taking off their training wheels. Add a pinch of math or djent metal influence (Meshuggah, specifically), slight passages of melodic death ala At the Gates, and dual grunt/snarl vocals that sound like your average overbearing tribute to early Carcass, Morbid Angel and Deicide, and let simmer for 32 minutes of dejected, which blows its load all too soon with almost all of its most potentially interesting tricks in the title track, which features several flighty death metal passages dispersed among numerous chug downs. \"The Somatic Defilement\" is like being teased with a death metal carrot down a shady alley only to be jumped by a pack of metalcore kids wearing huge pants and wallet chains.\n\nThis is not the only track that throws away its better seconds to a wasteland of mediocre mosh chugging. \"Prostatic Fluid Asphyxiation\" cycles between a decent opening volley of technical, clinical death spasms to some Meshuggah-like riffing, and then closes with an awful, hack palm mute sequence. \"Fairy Fay\" gives you about 10 seconds of something brisk before it too segues into the gutter, though there's a nice atmosphere as the lyrics bounce over the mutes into the bridge sequence. \"Alone in the Morgue\" teases us once more with its intense double bass driven old school death metal riff, sort of a mesh of Suffocation and Pestilence, but then erupts with some choppy, uninspiring riffs and guitar squeals before...you guessed it, another flatulent break down heavy on the palm muting, which completely strangles the momentum.\n\nIt's pretty unfortunate, because you can tell if these guys could stop fucking around and further some of their better ideas, they'd manifest into at least an average brutal/tech death metal outfit. Granted, that in itself is not for everyone, but personally I'd find it more compelling than what often seems a ceaseless tirade forged to sate the lowest common denominator of metal and hardcore fans; the mosh tyrant who couldn't give two shits about music, just a free chance to beat on people without spending a night in the slammer. Whitechapel do pen some pretty sadistic lyrics about molestation, murder and sexual malpractice, so in this way they're not a far cry from your typical gore or rape fantasy death metal element, with a slightly more psychotic spin, but the music doesn't even come close to building to a climax before it constantly lets you down with its shallow, vapid grooving and 'tough' sounding death/core vocals.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAt first glance, Whitechapel appears to be just another typical Deathcore band. However, there is much to behold underneath the surface. These guys know exactly how to make technical, unique and heavy music, while also maintaining a very unique style of writing lyrics. This opinion didn't come to me right away, though. When I first heard their breakthrough album, The Somatic Defilement, I wasn't impressed. I just saw them as, like I said before, just another Deathcore band with nothing to offer. However, when I picked up their sophomore album, This Is Exile, my opinion completely changed. This album kicked my ass. I decided to give their first album another chance, and I came to the conclusion that it is just alright. Then I heard that they were releasing a new album and I figured that they have only gotten better with age, so this album should completely blow me away.\n\nNeedless to say, I wasn't \"blown away\"....\n\nA New Era Of Corruption is just a step in the wrong direction for this band. From the first song, you can tell that they are breaking away from their \"core\" roots with the almost complete absence of noticeable breakdowns, which may be an improvement in the eyes (or ears) of some... but, it's just not Whitechapel. There is a much higher amount of groove and melody in this album. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's overkill in this one. To me, it sounds like it comes from an inspiration from Cannibal Corpse. That's not what Whitechapel fans want.\n\nAmong other things, Phil Bozeman's vocal style has almost completely done away with his high pitch screams in order to focus on a more gutteral sound. Don't get me wrong, this kid is still fantastic, but it doesn't give you much to look forward to. Also, his writing style is just more of the same as it was in This Is Exile. Misanthropy and anti-religion galore. The only real exception is the song \"Animus\", the iTunes bonus track which is about the death of Phil's mother. \n\nThe guitars in this album are not impressive at all. They consist primarily of power chords, triplets, basic metalcore riffing with a down-tuned feel, and the occasional, unappealing solo. Like always, the bass in this album is almost inaudible, with the minor exception of a little bass solo in \"Reprogrammed To Hate\". It's not all bad, though. In the first song, \"Devolver\", there is a catchy little guitar lick in the chorus that is pleasant. Also, in \"Murder Sermon\", there is a little tremolo riff that you have to really listen for in the first verse that is, although not too impressive, noticeable. \n\nThe lack of impressive drumming in this album is a huge disappointment. Kevin Lane is an amazing drummer, but he sounds a bit drowned out in this album. In This Is Exile, he is so audible that he is almost the only thing that you listen to. In ANEOC, you really have to focus to be able to hear anything worth remembering. Sure, there are plenty of impressive blast beats and triggered bass drums, but after the first five songs, you tend to look in the mirror and say \"I really don't care anymore.\"\n\nAll in all, A New Era Of Corruption is a good album, but it's a huge disappointment considering their previous releases. If you're looking for a good Deathcore album that will force orgasm after orgasm, pass on this one. Either pick up their sophomore album, or pick up the Upon A Burning Body album. I'd reccomend this for new fans, but not for long time fans. If this really is a new era of corruption, count me out. I'll stick with the past. \n\nStandout Tracks: Reprogrammed To Hate, Unnerving, Murder Sermon\n",
        "\nI really need to start doing my reviews in a band's chronological order. I just got done writing a review for Whitechapel's second demo, deeming it the \"heaviest deathcore release ever\", and then some voice on my shoulder whispered \"Hey, review the first demo, too!\" Damn you, voices. Now I'm faced with an even better demo and I'm perplexed as to how I should write this one because I used up all my good metaphors. \n\nThis record has the same scratchy production as the second demo, and for the songs that are on both demos, it's obvious that few changes were made. No atmosphere here, just raw salvaged brutality in the form of relentless momentum. Breakdowns are heavy, and way heavier than any other album I've heard. Basically, this is an unrefined death metal demo with breakdowns, not a \"deathcore\" album.\n\nThe guitars are actually more complex at times than they are on the second demo (some parts border on mathcore), and they have a hollow, ominous tone to them that definitely helps the overall sound. Other than somewhat random wankish parts in select songs, the guitarwork is in the same position it was on Demo II and The Somatic Defilement. The song \"Ear to Ear\" still has the guitar solo that's present on the next demo but absent on the full-length. And finally, the breakdowns are still \"blast-ish\" like they were on the other demo. Other than that, there's really not much of notice, other than the assorted distortions at the end of guitar measures. \n\nThe drummer, Derek Martin, isn't creating polyrhythms like he was on the next demo, but he's still galloping on the double-bass pedals and blasting as fast as he can. I think this band in general is carrying rhythm a lot better on this first demo than they did on the second. The vocalist, once again, is different. His highs are even more undeveloped and they're still a bit boring. However, on this first demo, Phil's still using the pig squeals, yeah, but they sound awesome! There's no dry, raspy sounds, and it comes out clean as a whistle. The growls are once again lower than they were the last time...This time around I'm not even going to attempt to describe it. Just listen to Exhumed and you'll get the picture.\n\nOnce again, it's not very likely you'll ever get your hands on this demo. However, if you get the chance, please do. This is not a perfect album, no, but for a demo clocking in at less than 20 minutes, it packs a punch.\n",
        "\nSo since I loved The Somatic Defilement as much as I did, I decided to check into Whitechapel's older shit. And wow. I've always called The Somatic Defilement the heaviest deathcore album on the face of the Earth, and now I hear this, and I'm rescinding what I said before. This is - officially - the most brutal deathcore album I have ever heard. I hate to call myself a liar, but I deserve it.\n\n\"Why?\", some of you may be asking. Well, the whole general sound is a lot rawer. No ambience, no holds barred, no bullshit. Just raw, uncensored, death metal riffs. The production is a bit rough, but it's quite good, with an extremely enjoyable crunch sound to the guitar. The breakdowns are stripped bare - just the way they should be. Think of it as Exhumed succumbing to -core.\n\nThe guitars sound pretty much the same compared to the way they would on the full-length, taking the half-assed production into account. Most of the guitar riffs are a bit simplified, but that's not to say they're bad. Actually, since they retain the energy and hectic ballistics and they're using less energy, all the power to them. Believe it or not, there is an actual solo in the middle of \"Ear to Ear\"; solos were entirely absent on the full-length. Another improvement is the breakdowns. I have said time and time again that I generally don't like the chug-fests. However, the breakdowns that were good on the full-length, have turned GREAT here. The outro breakdown for \"Ear to Ear\" has amplified tenfold in intensity, and yet it still doesn't sound stupid. One thing, though: I still don't think there is a bassist in this band. It might just be due to the production standards, but still. \n\nThe drummer is quite the likeable guy. Derek Martin left the band after this demo, and he will be missed. His beats are constantly driven by a 4/4 cymbal beat while his feet perform in another time signature...Meshuggah, anyone? A lot of his beats use the \"galloping\" technique with the foot pedal (intro to \"Alone in the Morgue\"), and it turns out quite nicely. And Phil Bozeman...Strangely enough, however much I like this guy's vocals, he's probably the main thing bringing this demo down. Why? For one, he decided to use pig squeals here. And quite frankly, he can't do them right. They're not the wet, clean squeals: these are dry, painful-sounding, and unforgiving - not a plus. For two, his screams are a bit undeveloped and more free-range than tamed and tuned. It sounds as if he didn't really care either way how it sounded. His growls, though...They are fucking amazing. On the demos, Phil is going at least as low as Matt Harvey or Karl Sanders, without a gurgle, but low and devastating. I can only imagine how riled the scene kids would get around 2006 when he let loose one of his growls in the middle of the mosh pit.\n\nIf somehow you can get a hold of this record, I would highly recommend you do so. This is another great record by a once-great band and you'd be a fool to ignore it.\n",
        "\nCan an explosion be moderated? Can spontaneous combustion be contained or controlled? If \u201cThis is Exile\u201d is anything to go by, adding accuracy and composure to flaming rage has incredible consequences, for this is a manic tour de force the likes of which I have never experienced from Whitechapel\u2019s piss-weak peers in the generic genre of deathcore.\n\nGenerally, deathcore is a metal-by-numbers kind of genre, an easy transition into heavy music for scene kids who are tiring of their Trivium albums. Bands like Belay my Last and Carnifex all have the same formulaic approach to creating pseudo-death metal sounds with adolescent aggressive lyrics, chunky percussive guitar riffs and drums loaded with double-bass. Whitechapel, however, have just turned it all on its head. \n\nDon\u2019t mistake this for an album that is genre-defying, though. It is still undoubtedly deathcore, with all the aforementioned shortcomings. I don\u2019t know when the bands, and more importantly, the fans, will tire of the chug-chug palm-muted guitars and drop-tuned riffs that define this genre. But Whitechapel does it all with a twist, there\u2019s a sense of real urgency and sincere anger on this album. Some of the songs feature very interesting structures and ideas, something that is clearly amiss with the thousands of other deathcore bands out there. Songs like \u201cPossession\u201d and \u201cTo All That Are Dead\u201d even feature some melodic guitar-work and very progressive interludes. This album also did away with the obligatory one-minute album intro consisting of distorted synths and/or horror movie sample/serial killer interview that every deathcore band seems to have(including Whitechapel themselves on their debut album). So \u201cThis is Exile\u201d isn\u2019t genre-defying, but quite possibly genre-defining instead.\n\nRight from the first few seconds on the opener \u201cFather of Lies\u201d the brutality rears its metal head and it doesn\u2019t let up until the end. This album incorporates all the best elements from its genre, sometimes even leaving the cursed \u201c-core\u201d suffix away altogether, using excellent songwriting and irresistible rhythms to generate bursts of compulsive fury from start to finish. Utilizing even doom riffs and time signatures at times, the atmosphere on \u201cThis is Exile\u201d is very heavy. Every song puts the listener on a precipice, expecting Whitechapel to drop you mercilessly into aural assault, head-first, which they do. Again and again. Every song is memorable and addictively aggressive, but not in a mindless Cannibal Corpse way. The clever songwriting will ensure repeated listens even after you have grown numb to the brutality.\n\nAs with most deathcore songs, the songs here have \u201chooks\u201d, those memorable, somewhat anthemic sections that get stuck in your head. This is part of deathcore\u2019s appeal, undoubtedly what attracts millions of teenagers to the genre. So maybe the lyrics aren\u2019t too original, and deathcore isn\u2019t ideally anyone\u2019s favorite genre, but this album is irresistible! The breakdown on the title track, amongst many others, is monstrously heavy and impulsive headbanging cannot be helped. Narrow-minded pretension will prevent many from enjoying Whitechapel, but honestly, if you refuse to hear an album based on the fact that it is deathcore and that the songs have breakdowns, you are no better than the black metal elitists.\n\nThe vocals are infinitely better than any other deathcore band, even the higher-pitched vocals, usually a scathing irritation in deathcore, are bearable and at times enjoyable. The growls, however, are the truly excellent part here, being guttural and deep, true death metal with better range than even real death metal bands like Nile or Cannibal Corpse can muster. The deep vocals sound awesome, with immense power and aggression throughout the album. The three guitarists create a very interesting sound, enhancing the rhythm guitar sections, making it all sound enormous. There is hardly any need for bass with the amount of brutality the two rhythm guitars convey! The drums are pummeling and perfectly tuned, with double-bass and blast beats being particularly impressive. \n\nUnfortunately, certain deathcore weaknesses occasionally stain through the immense tapestry of sound. There are riffs, like near the end of \u201cSomatically Incorrect\u201d, that are downright irritating. Also, the instrumental \u201cDeath Becomes Him\u201d is not very strong, rather redundant. But the utter worst element of deathcore, bad enough to almost cause me to disregard the entire genre, is hardcore shouty vocals! The group shouting is nauseating, it is an infectious disease that ruins songs and sometimes entire albums. Thankfully, Whitechapel managed to rein in their desire to use this effect, and they let it out only once, on the 7-minute closing track \u201cMessiahbolical\u201d, and even there it almost ruined an excellent track. There will undoubtedly be sections of this album that will get on your nerves, as all deathcore does, but I urge you to look beyond this and see Whitechapel\u2019s colossal achievement here. Every song is enjoyable and the innovation is unremitting. Whitechapel is by far the most talented deathcore band out there today.\n\nSo while \u201cThis is Exile\u201d probably won\u2019t replace your favorite Behemoth album, and its playcount on your iPod will slow down after a few weeks, it remains an excellent effort as far as deathcore goes. Whitechapel is a class act and I hope they continue to release quality albums. So, is deathcore the new death metal? God I hope not. The repetition and feigned anger will kill me long before becoming a scene kid will make me kill myself. But perhaps Whitechapel will kill the \u201ccore\u201d in their sound eventually , and even if they don\u2019t, at least they create hope for the genre.\n",
        "\nFor Whitechapel, making an album that kicks ass doesn't seem to be that hard. Their first album, The Somatic Defilement, is still to this day one of the heaviest deathcore releases out there, and the second album, This is Exile, is one of the most influential deathcore albums out there (we can hear this by the newer releases from bands like Impending Doom, Oceano, and And Hell Followed With). Whitechapel have made a mark on the modern metal scene, and either you love the band's music, or you hate it. A New Era of Corruption is a prime example of this, as a lot of people hate it for certain reasons, and others love it for their own reasons. \n\nNow, let's move on to the music. First of all, the songs on this album, (along with the previous two albums), actually have GUITAR SOLOS!!! Surprise, surprise! I guess people can stop hating Whitechapel for having no solos, considering there's one in about every other song of theirs, which, who cares about not having flaming finger-pickin' guitar solos in every fucking song? If a song is good, it's good, and not having a guitar solo shouldn't change that. BUT! If you want guitar solos, look no more! I'm positive you can find guitar solos in the songs \"Breeding Violence\", \"Reprogrammed to Hate\", \"A Future Corrupt\", \"Prayer of Mockery\", \"Necromechanical\", and (although there isn't a solo per-se in the song) \"Single File to Dehumanization\" has some great guitarwork that has an almost soft, yet dark melody, before they crush you with one of the best breakdowns on the album. \n\nWhile on the subject of guitars, I'll go ahead and mention that the band decided to experiment quite a few times with acoustic guitars, sometimes offering an almost spanish-style playing (just past the half-way mark in \"End of Flesh\"), and then a soft, almost mesmerizing section beginning at around 2:26 on \"Murder Sermon\". Then a couple songs later you'll hear the acoustic being brought out for a short outtro to \"Single File to Dehumanization\", which also closes off the album. \n\nNow, deathcore is known for its breakdowns, so don't pick up a deathcore album expecting a band to have a lot of solos and little to no breakdowns. If that's what you want, stick to death metal. Deathcore is also known for having terribly generic breakdowns, riffage, lyrics, and annoying vocals. Fortunately, A New Era of Corruption only has generic riffage, which aren't even all that generic, but mostly unique and different from other deathcore bands, examples would be the chorus riff in \"Devolver\" and the riffs in \"A Future Corrupt\". Aside from that, the breakdowns all have their distinctive sound to them, and flow with the music very well, the lyrics, (usually ranging from the topics of God to hatred and violence, you know.... general metal topics, but with good meaning behind the songs), and Phil Bozeman's performance on vocals was done extremely well. He pulls of his deathgrowls and gutturals with ease, and uses little high screams, and when highs are used, they're used at the right time and for the right length, making them sound great, as opposed to annoying. \n\nThe only reason why this album recieved a score as low as it is, is because the album seems to be missing something... maybe intensity. There aren't too many intense death metal riffs in the album, if any. It's not exactly the perfect album in the world, but it's well worth the money. Let's just say that. \n\nI'm the kind of person that reads the sentence \"Whitechapel made Bring Me the Horizon sound manlier than fuck with this album!\" and I shake my head. I don't see how ungodly guttural vocals, lyrics about bashing God and the end of the world, non-generic breakdowns, and some damn cool riffs and guitar solos makes Whitechapel lame at all, but Bring Me the Horizon aren't anywhere CLOSE to manly. But whatever, just proves that some \"metalheads\" out there are pretty fucking stupid and don't know what they're talking about. My point for the previous paragraph was to say that, my advice, don't listen to half of what people say when it comes to that stuff, because you won't find songs about lollipops and rainbows here. Whitechapel made an epic win with A New Era of Corruption, and I give it a solid 90%. If you are a fan of GOOD deathcore, go pick up this album, I promise you won't be disappointed.\n",
        "\nAnd now for the sentence that will destroy all my credibility: this album is actually a great deathcore album. I'll give you a moment to let that sink in. Now, anyway, I know how we all think of deathcore as \"sloppily executed\", and \"disgraceful\". To an extent, I can actually agree. I, too, hate my music filled with such bullshit as \"breakdowns\", \"pig squeals\", and \"br00tality\", and I think anyone who enjoys music simply for those three factors should be anally impaled on a stick covered in barbed wire. However, Whitechapel have found the best combination with this album. It's br00tal enough to appeal to the scene kids, but it still has the actual elements that real metalheads will love.\n\nLooking from a moderate distance away, Whitechapel (or their first album, I should say) is semi-brutal deathcore. I've heard people declare that Whitechapel has \"black metal\" influence, citing the vocals and their screams, but to that I say fucking bullshit. More on this subject later. But basically, this album has about everything right. There are a few awkward parts in the music, but overall, this is great. The guitars make great riffs, the drummer definitely knows his shit, and the vocalist is just shocking.\n\nLet's start with that guy, the vocalist, okay? If deathcore ever had a wedding for whatever reason (perhaps marrying emo and becoming the worst hybrid genre on Earth, emo-death?), Phil Bozeman would be the \"best man\"...literally. This guy is definitely the most talent that has come out of deathcore thus far. His growls beat all but the most brutal death metal vocals, and they have the natural gurgle that simply makes them sickeningly awesome. This guy could fit great into a brutal death metal band, and I promise you no one would be complaining. Sometimes, though (particularly, when his voice is raised almost halfway), his voice leans just a bit too close to the \"I'm awesome, dude!\" side of deathcore. His gutturals are just amazing, though. Listen to \"The Somatic Defilement\" at 0:22. Some would say that he sounds like a fucking toilet; I say \"Isn't that basically what brutal death metal aims for in the vocal department?\" His highs are high and raw, but for God's sake, men, this is not signs of a \"black metal influence\". Black metal screams are raspy, and full of Satan-loving hate. These are comparatively clean, and they're hateful, all right, but you can tell it's a different kind of hate. A bit leaning towards \"I'm going to stick your hand in a blender\". Either way, blackened or not, these highs are good. The only place where I absolutely despise them are at 0:58 in \"Festering Fiesta\". Tell me that doesn't \"scream\" (hurr hurr) Suicide Silence. These guys were trying to escape the grip of typical deathcore in this album as a general rule, but it appears they got pulled back in for a few awful seconds. They're not as good as they could be (honestly, these would be better if they WERE black metal screams, as they would fit better with the melody of the guitars), but they appear to have been vocalized exactly as the singer desired, and thus the vocals are a success overall. Sometimes the vocals are layered together, like at the end of \"Articulo Mortis\" where the highs and lows collaborate to say \"And then you rot\", and it has potential to send chills down the listener's spine.\n\nAlthough you won't notice it by ear, there are three guitarists taking part in the riffs on this album. This is the only part that I think is just stupid, because you'll never hear more than two of them playing at once. But besides that, this band makes quite good riffs. Many of them are focused mainly on a mix of distortion and brutality, and melody. A few standout ones to look for are the riff after the intro of \"Prostatic Fluid Asphyxiation\", the one proceeding the intro of \"Devirgination Studies\", or the beginning of \"Alone In The Morgue\". The breakdowns are probably the best you'll hear in the world of breakdowns. Honestly, that's not saying much. The breakdowns aren't typical -core shit for the most part, though. They're mostly fast, technical, and they have the decency to stop the music before the breakdown commences so it's not entirely terrible. Some are slow beyond belief, but even then, the band makes the breakdowns interesting because of the tuning in their guitars (the downtuned, slightly quirky factor makes the breakdowns more tolerable than, say, Suicide Silence, who are downtuned but just boring), because there is usually a constant cymbal echoing throughout the song, and because more often than not there's an instrumental or ambient noise behind them, like 1:43 in \"Devirgination Studies\". I hear people talking about how this album uses the breakdowns excessively. For one, yes, every song has a breakdown, but it's usually no more than two, and it's usually short. For two, have you heard Whitechapel's follow-up to this album? It's literally half-composed of breakdowns, which is more than can be said for this album. Like most deathcore albums, however, the bassist is nowhere to be found on this entire composition. I always joke that they do that because they're idiots and they don't know how to play an instrument. But if the guitarists are any indication, this guy has talent, so he needs to stop letting his instrument get tuned out of the album's mixing process. \n\nThe drummer is probably the most talented face in deathcore (except for maybe JFAC's drummer, but I only realized how good he was when he started playing death metal). The set itself sounds pleasurable: the bass pedal sounds like a muted snare, and the snare sounds just a bit silenced and tapered. The crash sounds dry and flat, but the other cymbals have a desired \"ding\" to them that fits well with the music. He plays fills mostly with the bass pedals (and he makes some really cool rhythms with them, I might add), but he uses the whole goddamn kit at times. Not a drum nor a cymbal is untouched in this album. His works may sometimes be simplistic, but these moments are quite outweighed by the times he's being technical with himself. Want an example? Just listen to the riff of \"Ear to Ear\" at 1:41, where he's blasting almost like Inferno himself in excess of 200 beats per minute. Later in this song, we see he can be technical with himself while slowing down a bit, and the result is almost godly.\n\nThe lyrics are great. Although Whitechapel's other two albums are random ranting on religion with a third-grader's vocabulary, they have quite a way with words here. It's probably the only time I've heard gutting, raping, and overall destruction of decency being put into a form that was beautiful. (\"Pass the tissues, please... *sniffle*\") Their vocabulary is quite rife with words that make spelling bee participants cringe and writers start using these five-dollar gems, like \"suppuration\", \"abattoir\", \"inimical\", \"ingurgitate\", and \"zygoma\". They also know quite well how to write lines about rape without sounding like a sexual pervert or an idiot: \"As she chokes and gargles spit/ I amputate her salty clitoris\". Again, these lyrics are performed by a deathcore band, but I feel this element of theirs could find their place in a different genre (in this case, goregrind). \n\nThis is the best deathcore that will ever sprout from the face of the Earth. Although most of the genre's offspring is a failure, some break through the membrane of horrendousness into mediocrity. This album went past that, however. I think it's safe to say that Whitechapel's full-length will never be touched in terms of deathcore. As Whitechapel have shown, even they can't come near topping this album. They can only sit back, look, and reminisce at the masterpiece they created back in the year of 2007.\n",
        "\nOh shit\u2026Holy shit, what an abomination! This album even made Bring Me the Horizon sound manlier like fuck! And here I am, thinking that \u201cThis is Exile\u201d is bad enough. Well, this IS worse. You don\u2019t believe me, do you? Well, you go hear what I have to say.\n\nBefore we ever talk about the album\u2019s cons, let\u2019s talk about the pros first. First thing\u2019s the production, which sounds very modern indeed, like deathcore. Another thing is the brutality of the vocals, which is very deep and very guttural. Another thing is the solo on \u201cReprogrammed to Hate\u201d, which is probably the only solo in this full-length. Besides, that solo might be the only guitar part I appreciate, if ever. The last thing I like bout this album is the album art. It just looks like a picture from a sci-fi movie, with all those robots posing wickedly.\n\nThat\u2019s all folks, because we\u2019ll now be talking about all the shit here in this album! We have here first the music, which is simply directionless and amateurish (the only exception here would be the solo mentioned above). You just can\u2019t tell how the songs in this album go, and \u201cA New Era of Corruption\u201d is even their third full-length! For instance, we have here \u201cDevolver\u201d, which is the album\u2019s intro. What you can hear from the start are loads of \u201cchugga-chugga\u201d riffs, and then some eerie riff for a chorus. Some \u201cchugga-chugga\u201d riffs and a breakdown follow. Now, does that sound something that has sense? Oh yeah, another thing about the \u201cchugga-chugga\u201d riffs here is that the songs have too much of those for their own good, which is definitely very dreadful.\n\nAnother thing is the overall brutality each song showcases. Damn, we have here some very senseless shit. Although the vocals are indeed brutal, mixing it with the other instruments make each song makes the album br00tal (so fake indeed\u2026). Some songs even feature senseless techno beats (not that I\u2019m against techno) and rapped death grunts, both of which sound outright atrocious, and this is supposed to be deathcore, goddammit, not some techno rap-metal fusion! \n\nThis album simply is a waste of time, money and effort. Well, if you have bought the CD already, don\u2019t feel bad. You could even use it as a coaster or as a frisbee. Otherwise, sell this CD to an ignorant scene kid.\n\nOriginally made for http://mystifymyserie.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nAt the turn of this new album, Whitechapel have really gone past the point of no return. From their attempt with 'This is Exile' we now enter a chapter of dissapointment. As such follows.\n\nWhitechapel open the album with 'Devolver', a song that creates a mood brings you back to 'This is Exile'. Why? Because in most practicality it's the same idea. Whitechapel create a verse and then a chorus and simply REPEAT, losing all sense of actual entertainment in the song. The song later goes into some slow and boring chugging that continues far too long. And so 'Devolver' is more over a down-towned version of 'Father of Lies'. A mediocre attempt at creating something impressive to open up. But it doesn't end there.\n\n'Breeding Violence' begins, 'CHUG-CHUG-CHUG' before the vocalist breaking into some moments of 'Possession'-like lines which are let out at a relatively same tempo. The song just creates an incredibly small loop and repeats before breaking into a mediocre solo and looping again. Whitechapel don't even seem to be bothered to make any attempt significant. \n\nOverall the guitar sound is generally insignificant. Chugging through when it can and never really moving forward except to play incredibly similar riffs that bridge parts of the song. Whitechapel aren't really giving us anything to enjoy that sounds fresh and new. The drumming is generally the same, loose and stays in the background and is never really noticeable. Blast beats being non-enjoyable as the guitar dumbs it down into just weak and flimsy drumming.\n\nNow the vocals are more Death-antiquated which makes for generally better sounding vocals but doesn't derive from the stringy boring deathcore vocals that are typical over the span of the album and follow the dissapointing routine as the rest of the album. If the guitar repeats, They repeat. Not interesting. Another thing to be noted is how there is generally a 'Creator' in most of the lyrical themes which isn't precisely entertaining content over 41 minutes. One thing i don't understand is End of Flesh's opening lyric: \n'I AM ALIVE'\nagainst the opening line of the next song:\n'I AM GOD'\nAs if we are supposed to be shocked by how incredible the music actually is. \n\nWell no thanks Whitechapel, Overall 'A New Era of Corruption' as noted in the album title, is repetitive, non-fresh and really a tiresome attempt that really makes you wonder if Whitechapel can really be bothered to make another attempt? Or are we even bothered to care if it sounds like this?\n",
        "\nTwo seconds into the first track, we're greeted by a guttural growl which is united with a simplistic but somehow almost memorable riff. At 0:20, we start getting some layered vocals of black metal-reminiscent highs and generic but somehow appreciatively good lows. That's a basic summarization of Whitechapel's second full-length, This Is Exile. It has two groups of songs: a few tracks that stand out and make you stare in disbelief, and then the rest of them. The problem is, that \"rest of them\" part's content all feels either repetitive, boring, or just plain stupid.\n\nLet's get down to the most important part of the review: the musical content. The second-best song on this album is the title track. Almost immediately, on top of a bunch of mindless, unimportant guitar riffs, you hear a fast set of vocals...Wait, rapping in deathcore? (I've seen everything now.) Admittedly, it sounds a bit stupid, but it's still ten times better than the \"br00tal mast3r\" vocals of Wanking the Cadaver's vocalist. Then we head into the \"chorus\", if you can call it that (it appears exactly once in the whole song), The song then proceeds to go into a breakdown, and then an even SLOWER breakdown. It's quite well performed, though, so it's not as much of a bother as it sounds. Then the song picks up tempo again, and Phil Bozeman showcases his black metal vocals. Then the song slows down AGAIN (seriously, what the fuck?) and we get a breakdown until the end of the song. Great. But where the album really shines is the last track, \"Messiahbolical\". It's the slowest song with vocals on the album, and it quite efficiently serves the purpose of being the epic closure to this album. It resembles a slam-death song quite well as it chugs along for about three minutes, reaching the climax of the song at 1:50, when Phil Bozeman goes as guttural as possible while backed by a streaming double-bass pedal but a forgettable guitar riff. Everything stops at around 3:30 and the song goes into an ambient guitar riff for about two and a half minutes. This ambience would be appreciated if it were better spaced; instead, it develops all the instruments in two separate parts, instead of steadily adding onto the instruments already playing. Near the end of the ambience, it all breaks down into...well, a breakdown, which continues until the end of the song. I might add that this is the only song on the album that utilizes the guitars with memorability; the rest of the time it's either melodic to the point of cheesiness or background noise.\n\nSadly, as a Whitechapel fan, I must admit that those are the only high marks I can give to this album, besides the cool album cover, which is pretty memorable. The rest of the album is ridiculous for one reason or another. \"Father of Lies\" lacks no hook in the instruments or the vocals whatsoever; \"To All That Are Dead\" has a good beginning and a decent ending coupled with (you guessed it) a breakdown but has nothing outstanding otherwise; \"Somatically Incorrect\" starts as a breakdown and sounds just like \"Father of Lies\" with gutturals; and \"Eternal Refuge\" is slow but it comes across as less \"epic\" and more \"we're too lazy to bring up the tempo although we're perfectly capable of doing so\". Later in this song, we come to the slowest breakdown of this album. Not Emmure or Bring Me The Hairspray \"slow\", but slow enough to where it's not able to be taken seriously. \"Exalt\" has a decent double-bass and pretty good riffs, which might make it qualify as the third best song, but there's an awkward moment midway where Guy Kozowyk from The Red Chord chimes in. Even amongst the growls he's perfectly able to hit, he raises his voice to speaking level and sounds like a teenager who has just discovered his first pubic hair and is cheering happily for joy, which ruins the song not only metaphorically but literally, as the rest of the song has nothing else of notice. \"Possession\" starts promising with an extremely addicting polyrhythmic beginning, but it fades after 20 seconds and the band drops all the momentum and potential the song had, sets it on fire, and stomps it to ash, then continues wherever their \"creative genius\" leads them, which, in this song, turns out to be nowhere. The instrumentals are extremely boring, as Whitechapel's guitarists seem to lack any real melody even when they are the only thing really standing out. \"Death Becomes Him\" is a slow snorefest as the guitarists repeat notes over and over again until you almost want to stab the CD. \"Of Legions\" is the intro to \"Messiahbolical\", but it's too long, it tries to be ambient but fails, and to the listener, it appears to be just random noise while he/she waits for the music to start. Then, halfway in, the music DOES start, and guess what it is? That's right; a BREAKDOWN! Ugh, seriously, haven't there been enough of these on this album already? The Somatic Defilement was full of breakdowns, but they were well-placed and only used when necessary. Here, they're everywhere for no real reason. But I digress. The worst song on this album, by far, is the \"great\" song \"Daemon: The Procreated\". This utterly shittastic song starts with a breakdown, then as soon as that's over, Whitechapel tries really hard to create a melody but fails so utterly, it's laughable. It sounds like they put every single note from a guitar onto their MP3 player as an individual song, shuffled it, and played whatever came out. The layered vocals then shout \"Daemon\" over and over and OVER. We get more breakdowns and forgettable riffs, then the end of the song arrives. A breakdown, of course. Phil shouts \"This is the end of all life\". If this was performed properly it would have given the song a redeeming quality; however, they even had to fuck THIS up by putting a fade-in effect on the vocals. So now instead of an angry Phil-Bozeman Demon growling this, we have what sounds like a constipated man on the toilet shouting \"THIS IS THE END OF ALL LIFE\", which is so terrible that it's hilarious. \n\nAnother weak point is the lyrics. Apparently, after dropping the subject of Jack the Ripper, Whitechapel realized that they have nothing worthwhile to actually talk about. So they go on and on...about nothing. At some points, the lines are so cheesy and stupid you wonder how grown men could even think of them without putting marujuana into the mix. Take for example this beautiful gem from \"Possession\":\n\"I am glad to inform, you're all in a world of shit, \nCoprophagia would be the only solution, \nOpen your fucking mouth and ingest what you are\"\nLike, what the fuck? It might have been a good spur-of-the-moment line, but seriously, did none of the six members look at this (two of the three guitarists stand around doing practically nothing; they probably could have done it while they were sitting on their asses) and say \"this sounds like something a seven-year-old would say\"? It's just pathetic. Some advice for Whitechapel: please don't fool me into thinking you let some random brain-damaged wiggers write the lyrics to all your songs, because I would just as well believe that.\n\nOverall, if you're a wigger or a scene kid who buys music to prove how hardcore you are, this album is a prime choice. However, if you're a person who looks to music for enjoyment, try one of Whitechapel's other two albums, or even better, a Behemoth or Nile album. If you're buying on iTunes, only buy the title track and \"Messiahbolical\", as the rest will only serve to bring down your view of those two songs. And please, for your own good, try to ignore the (majority of the) breakdowns, and your life will be that much sweeter.\n",
        "\nSo this is the follow-up album of \"The Somatic Defilement\", by infamous deathcore band Whitechapel. Little girls and boys who look like girls wear this band on their shirts all the time. Only one little problem: this is NOT deathcore. This is blackened death metal at its finest. The \"metalheads\" who constantly bash this record have not looked at it from a musician's perspective, and since I am a vocalist/bassist/keytarist, I know the talent of these guys. Anyways, on to the review.\n\nWhen I first popped this album in, I pressed play and expected a breakdown. I got a full on death metal ear assault. The opening track \"Father of Lies\" ripped through my speakers and hit me with the lowest growl I have ever heard. Oh, did I mention this is only the first 5-10 seconds of the song? The rest of the album rips just as well.\n\nThe guitar department is certainly one of the heftier ones in death metal. Lead guitarist Ben Savage and rhythm guitarists Alex Wade and Zach Householder bring some killer riffs. On songs like \"This is Exile\" and \"To All That Are Dead\", Zach and Alex riff away with harmonies and chugga-chugga riffs (in the enjoyable way), while Ben Savage adds ambience effects and killer harmonics and solos to add this \"blackened\" feel to the music. All songs have this, including the closing track \"Messiahbolical\", a 7 minute epic. The guitars build along with the killer bass and drum lines up into the climax of the song, and you are stuck wondering \"How can scenesters enjoy this?\". Truly fantastic guitar performance.\n\nThe vocals are certainly nothing to laugh at either. Phil Bozeman has a fantastic range, and his dual vocals compliment each other very well. His high growls in \"Posession\", \"Eternal Refuge\", and \"This Is Exile\" make your bones shake, and ask you \"Does Shagrath know about this?!?\". His growls are insanely gutteral (listen to the opening growl for \"Father of Lies\"; sets the tone for the album). Phil gives his best, and it pays off.\n\nI wish I could say something more than \"Where is the bass, Gabe?\" for Gabe Crisp's performance. That's the reason this didn't get a perfect score. You can't hear the bass on any song. \"Father of Lies\" is a pure guitar assault song, and so are the rest for the most part. In \"Messiahbolical\", he adds a bass line behind the guitars in the mid-song clean break that gives a chill down your spine and leaves you craving more bass sounds. I know Gabe is a fantastic bassist, and hopefully, the next release will be his shining moment.\n\nThe drums are fucktardedly fantastic. Kevin Lane is the star of this record. His jazzy-influenced playing on songs such as \"Exalt\" and \"Somatically Incorrect\" make for a damn good death listen. His intro rolls on \"This Is Exile\" and \"Father of Lies\" create an expression on your face that will be hard to get rid of. His drumming is competent, intense, and chaotic; yet, he keeps it all contained. Best drum performance on a metal record in a long time.\n\nAs a whole, this album is fantastic, and a refreshing and original listen. While some \"deathcore\" bands like Emmure and Bring Me The Horizon are giving this genre a bad name, Whitechapel will lay them to permanent rest. Everything on this album, every song on this album, even the artwork, is necessary to create the atmosphere Whitechapel was going for. Buy this record today, and you will love every goddamned second of it.\n\nGood job lads! Can't wait for the next one!\n",
        "\nThis is what gets people so angry? Really? Seems a bit strange, compared to many a modern metal band this isn't really so bad. Funny how people have no problem accepting various folk and symphonic metal variants, yet this is considered to be rubbish. I'd take this over Nightwish or Korpiklaani anyday. At least it's got short songs and doesn't have all of these grand pretentions. No operatic female vocals, either. \n\nIt basically sounds like a more slapstick version of death metal, I guess; everything's exaggerated a bit, made a bit cartoony. Breakdowns are more, well, breakdowny, vocals are pitch shifted for a bit more gutturalness, most riffs are made solely for the purpose of getting kids all violent and energetic. Honestly, I wish we had this stuff when I was 13, it's a hell of a lot better then Limp Bizkit. For simple stuff-designed-to-sell-to-angry-teenagers goes, this really isn't so bad?\n\nNot to say it's amazing, but you could do worse then this album, yeah. There's no bree bree, the vocals aren't too pitch shifted (although dual vocals were a terrible idea). There's riffs and a few melodies, somewhere in between the copious, guitars-as-percussion breakdowns. Drums don't seem terribly triggered, there's a bit of a mix in tempos. I'm of the opinion that if Whitechapel were willing to get out of the half time feel they're almost permanently stuck in, they'd be a decent enough band.\n\nAs it stands, though, they fall short of decent. Dual vocals, for one thing: that's an automatic 10% deduction. Lack of solos isn't a huge thing, but a few more widdly widdly bits would certainly go down well; most of the time the guitars are stuck to the bottom 5 or so frets, doing their best to sound like distorted bongos. It's no surprise that the best song, \"To All that Are Dead\" has a solo. It's just a nice distraction from the stringed percussion. Probably the main thing is just a simple lack of real memorable riffs. Nothing really sticks in your head here, seeing as most of the faster riffs are hopelessly generic DM ones- or that Metalcore sort of riffing with a bit of extra distortion, and it doesn't take too long before every breakdown sounds like the one before, and short of listening to this 50 or so times (not recommended) you'll have no idea which song is which- save perhaps \"Messiahbolical\", which stands out by virtue of it's gang vocals and detour into, I dunno, slowed down deathcore with synths (slam doom?). \n\nIt also doesn't really seem like they're trying terribly hard, either. It's always a bitch move, labelling an album as \"uninspired\", but this album really fits that term. Whereas, say, Waking the Cadaver seem to put everything they have - which isn't much - into their breakdown-fests, Whitechapel seem to just coast along, never really sounding angry, never playing to their full extent. It sounds like a bunch of session musicians playing a death core record. The faster sections don't really sound aggressive or visceral enough; Whitechapel always seem to play in their comfort zone, instead of perhaps getting a bit faster, meaner, and riffier. Maybe it's just the large amount of breakdowns that make this seem tired - when they launch into their next breakdown (for there's always another breakdown with Whitechapel) you get the feeling that (surprise surprise) they're just going through the motions, said motions being heavy palm muting on open strings.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this. If you're a kid who wants something designed for your unbearable, world-is-against-me angst, I'd suggest Korn's Follow the Leader, which to this day is easily the best record of its' kind. Honestly though, as far as mainstream metal goes, this band is the least of your worries.\n",
        "\nWhat the fuck happened? That\u2019s the first question that comes to mind upon listening to this album. Whitechapel\u2019s first album could be summed up as: decent death metal riffs with a slight core influence, that were unfortunately ruined by a shitload of breakdowns. This album can be summed up as: a shitload of breakdowns. \n\nEach song has a variety of riffs\u2026and a ton of breakdowns. The saddest part is that their old decency isn\u2019t totally gone. Every once in a while a good riff appears. In fact, there\u2019s usually one every song or two. Sometimes, get ready to be blown away, there\u2019re TWO good riffs in a song! These are usually intros. The intro to Possession is great; I\u2019m not even going to attempt to deny it. It sounds Meshuggah influenced and is heavy and intriguing. Unfortunately, the rest of the song fails to live up to the high standard set by the intro. They took the best riff on the whole album and than made an utterly shit song out of it. Good job, assholes. \n\nAll the songs are pretty damn similar. You have your intro riff, perhaps a filler riff or two, followed by a breakdown. Than you\u2019ll have a more melodic bit and than another breakdown followed by a bit more filler. Not every song goes in that order, but every song contains those parts and just sews them up in a different (and just as stupid) order. Well, that\u2019s not totally true. Some are dumber. Some START with breakdowns. That\u2019s the absolute low of breakdowns. I mean, think about it for a fucking second! It\u2019s a break - down. Look at those words and think about what they mean. It means that you\u2019re breaking down from something. A scientist would breakdown a composite to find out what it\u2019s made of. A businessman would break down his plan into the most essential parts before showing it to his boss. A breakdown in a good song extracts the essence of everything that had gone before and than bludgeons you over the head with it. It takes away all the fancy trimmings and shows you the relentlessly primitive core of the music. It contrasts what has gone before it. What does a breakdown at the beginning of a song do? What the fuck is it breaking down? The silence before the song? The last shit song? I honestly don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a breakdown for the sake of a breakdown. It\u2019s the band going, \u2018hey, scene kids could dance right here! They\u2019d love it!\u2019 and sticking it in for absolutely no musical reason whatsoever. Then again, there\u2019re worse things than starting with a breakdown. Like starting with a breakdown and having it FADE IN. What the fuck were they thinking? Fade ins and breakdowns make no sense together. \n\nThat\u2019s pretty much the pattern with a ton of these songs. There\u2019s a good riff, which draws you in and makes you think, \u2018hey, maybe this song will be good!\u2019 Unfortunately, no song manages to be good \u2013 or even decent \u2013 the whole way through. \n\nI\u2019ve already mentioned (several times) that a huge majority of these songs are composed of breakdowns. That on its own doesn\u2019t mean that the album will be bad. Dying Fetus and Devourment are about fifty percent breakdowns, yet I love both of those bands. That\u2019s because they write GOOD breakdowns. See, it\u2019s not enough to write a breakdown. That alone doesn\u2019t make a song brutal, or heavy, or whatever the fuck Whitechapel is trying to accomplish. See, breakdowns, like riffs, aren\u2019t made equal. There are good breakdowns, and then there are bad breakdowns. These are bad breakdowns. They\u2019re pointless, breakdowns for the sake of breakdowns. Utterly worthless. There\u2019s MAYBE two good breakdowns on the whole list and when I say good breakdowns, I don\u2019t mean great. I mean tolerable. Somewhat tolerable. That\u2019s what, a point o\u2019 one batting average (considering the stunning amount of chugging displayed on this CD)? For a band whose sole focus seems to be breakdowns, that\u2019s not a good thing. \n\nThe guitars on this album are technically proficient, but, for the most part, are completely un-enjoyable to listen to. The majority of the riffing is comprised of endless chugs. There are a few decent riffs, but they\u2019re few and far between. There are also several melodic passages. Some of these are surprisingly good. In fact, I\u2019m willing to say that they are the ONLY improvement over the first album. Of course, several of them have breakdowns playing behind them, which completely nullifies the whole concept of a melodic riff (not to mention the concept of a breakdown). I just have to ponder the thought process behind this. Did the lead guitarist start playing a melodic riff and the rest of the band start to feel left out? Even assuming that the breakdowns were good \u2013 rest assured, they\u2019re not \u2013 combining them with a melodic riff is a downright stupid idea. Do they believe that two good things simply ALWAYS equal a better thing? Would the band members like chocolate and barbecue sauce? After all, they\u2019re both good, why wouldn\u2019t they be better together?\n\nWhitechapel apparently believe, \u2018the same more is better!\u2019 thing about guitarists. If two guitarists were heavy\u2026then three would be like, really brutal! Dur! Three guitars are flat out not necessary for the majority of this. The music alternates between having two guitars chug and one play a melodic lead and having three guitars chug. The band apparently tries to have the two chugging guitars and the lead guitars interact and harmonize. On paper, this actually sounds like an awesome idea. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t work out quite as well as it sounds. See, the total of times that all the guitars did ANY sort of harmony is in the single digits. The low single digits. In fact, I think it\u2019s two. Maybe there\u2019s one or two more I missed, but I don\u2019t think so. Well, \u2018what\u2019s the big deal with using three guitars?\u2019 you might say. I guess you\u2019d be right, as it doesn\u2019t cause any specific new breed of awfulness. It doesn\u2019t propel them to new heights of shit, I suppose. Does it make the riffs heavier? No, but it doesn\u2019t make them actively WORSE either. Hell, without the third guitarists odds are that the melodic bits would be removed and all that would be left would be the breakdowns. Still, the third guitar completely and utterly drowns out the bass. As to why no deathcore bands have audible bass I honestly have no clue. It would make them a bit heavier, which seems to be their entire purpose in life. Alas, as of yet no band has incorporated the strange and (apparently, to them,) useless instrument into their music. \n\nLike most deathcore bands the drummer is by far the most skilled musician of the group. Unfortunately, he, like the majority of the album, is significantly worse than he was on the first album. His beats are more generic and he relies on blasting as a crutch far more. On the positive side he CAN blast without it sounding awkward and forced, a skill which many of his compatriots have yet to master. Double bass drum driven sections are far rarer than on the first album, and the drums sound far worse to boot. On the upside, the cymbals sound better. On the downside everything sounds more triggered and just overall more generic. Good tradeoff\u2026if listening to supposedly brutal metronome esque clicks gets you off. \n\nThis brings us to (one of) the worst let downs of the album: the vocalist and the lyrics. On the first album the vocalist was great and was one of the highlights of the album. That certainly isn\u2019t the case here. I honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the vocalist suffered a stroke in-between recordings. In the first album the vocals were varied and enjoyable. Low gutturals, high shrieks and more mid level assaults all traded places rapidly. Here ninety percent of the vocals resort to the guttural style. Not only that, but they\u2019re a dozen times worse than they were before. They\u2019re the epitome of generic deathcore gutturals. They\u2019re \u2018tuff guy\u2019 personified. The other styles are used rarely and almost every time they are there\u2019s some form of double tracking going on. One or two vocal lines are layered to the point where it just sounds like a computer trying to take a shit on you. The main offender with regards to this is one of the best melodic bits on the album. I guess the vocalist didn\u2019t like being left out, cause the second he came in the riff turned to shit. \n\nThe vocalist also never shuts up. He frequently ruins good riffs by holding one of the ever prevalent long, drawn out shit notes that \u2013core bands love. This reminds the rest of the band that they\u2019ve been playing a decent riff for far too long and that it\u2019s about time for a breakdown. And then, if the vocalist is in a particularly tuff mood, another breakdown after that! Not all the singing is guttural, or even harsh. During the last track, Messiahbolical, there is an example of a clean gang style chorus. Now, I listen to hardcore punk quite frequently. Gang choruses can have their place. They can give a song more energy and an empowering feel. Not so here. They just feel out of place and awful. \n\nThe Somatic Defilement\u2019s lyrics all focused on Jack the Ripper. Being one of the coolest serial killers of all time he undoubtedly boosted the albums score significantly. The lyrics were well done and (while some liberties were taken with the facts) portrayed a grim tale of horror and murder. After all, a true tale that contains grisly murders is infinitely more disturbing than fantasy murders. What\u2019s darker than reality? Well, apparently, the answer is fantasy. Generic, shitty, done to death, fantasy. The lyrics here are \u2013core to the core. Let\u2019s take a little excerpt from Possession: \u2018We love the disease!\u2019 Or maybe, \u2018We (chug) are (chug) the (chug) disease! (chug) disease! (chug) disease!\u2019 Well, isn\u2019t that just super! Got any other intricate tidbits of philosophy? Well, they do. \u2018Fuck your faith! Fuck your kind! Fuck your ways! Fuck your world!\u2019 God damn it, it\u2019s like misanthropy for scene kids. \n\nGo back, and skim through what\u2019s been said so far. As you do so look for references to the bands first album. They\u2019re everywhere. It\u2019s as if I was comparing Divine Intervention to Reign in Blood and saying how it failed to live up to it. There\u2019s only one problem with that comparison. Reign in Blood was a great album. The Somatic Defilement got a forty-five. If your standards are THAT low and you fail THIS hard, than something is wrong. The band went from innovative, and somewhat melodic, death metal with breakdowns to generic Deathcore. It\u2019s dumbed down from the first album in EVERY way. The drums are simpler. The guitars chug more and have less interesting riffs. The vocalist is a generic tough guy moron. The songwriting sucks. Breakdowns are everywhere. The band started at decent, made a U-turn, and drove off a fucking cliff. It all provokes a simply question: \n\nWhat happened? WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED!? \n\nI can only think of one reason why this happened. After Whitechapel finished recording their twenty minute first EP (sorry, album) they had a problem. See, their pals, the good old-fashioned Deathcore crowd, didn\u2019t like it. It was too complex. The vocals were too interesting and devoid of \u2013core influence. The lyrics were too intelligent. And what the fuck were all those things between the breakdowns? Ugh! So, Whitechapel had a simple choice. They could either be an innovative and slightly interesting death metal band\u2026or they could be Deatchore. They chose the latter. They jam packed the Somatic Defilement full of breakdowns, and in the process defiled the charm that the album once possessed. They added in what felt like ten minutes full of shitty breakdowns and called it a day. Any death metal fan that was in the mood for some mildly unique and pleasant music was required to wade through swamps of shitty breakdowns to get to it. Still, the majority of the musical terrain was made up of super slick and enjoyable highways and the times when it was required to push your own vehicle through a swamp of shit were rare. \n\nWell, the proportions are a bit different here. Now the whole thing is a fucking swamp and at (rare) times you see an old and half rotted away Rope Bridge hanging above the filthy water. Every time you grab onto it and think that you\u2019ll escape, the bridge breaks in half and breakdowns rush in at you from all sides. See, apparently, Whitechapel\u2019s friends still didn\u2019t like them. The album was still far too musically complex. Why did there have to be all those long shitty bits where the music wasn\u2019t just a series of mosh-able (sorry, danceable) chugs? \n\nSo, Whitechapel changed. They dumbed their sound down. They took every intriguing element of their music and strangled it before shitting on it and throwing it into the swamp of human feces that is made up of the breakdowns of this album. Bits of ripped flesh drifted to the surface and that was all that was left of the now deceased decency of this now idolized band. You know what I think? I think that if someone went through this whole thing they could actually make a halfway decent four-minute song out of the parts. Unfortunately, this album isn\u2019t a four-minute song. It\u2019s a forty-two minute album, and every other minute of it is filled up with Deathcore. You know what those little bits are? It\u2019s Whitechapel spitting on their few old death metal fans. It\u2019s them saying, \u2018we still CAN write good music, we\u2019d just rather write generic deathcore cause it sells.\u2019 It\u2019s there fuck you to their fans and I\u2019m more than happy to respond in kind. FUCK YOU TOO, WHITECHAPEL!\n\nThis album is awful. Do not buy it. Don\u2019t even download it. If you\u2019re interested if it\u2019s possible to see deathcore done right, go buy the Somatic Defilement and take a long drawn out shit while the breakdowns play. If you loved the riffing in the Somatic Defilement, don\u2019t get this, as said riffing is lying dead and mutilated in breakdown swamp. There is absolutely no reason to get this album, short of being a fan of generic deathcore, of course. You know what the sad part is? This band once held promise. That is dead now. Whitechapel is dead now. The last hope that Deathcore ever had to redeem itself is dead. And for god\u2019s sake\u2026STAY AWAY FROM ITS PUTRID CORPSE.\n",
        "\nMy second foray into the \"detestable\" genre of deathcore (the first being THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD, who I also thoroughly enjoy), upon both my curiousity to see what all the hate is about, and hopefully to find a more interesting form of extreme music. I'd been up to my neck in black metal since the late 90s, with almost daily exposure, and though I still love black metal and find it my favourite genre, bands nowadays are doing little to nothing in terms of keeping the style interesting; if nothing else they're obviously retreading familier territory, only cheaper and more hackneyed. So off I went, quite disenchanted, to various websites to sample newer bands who would hopefully pique my interest and help me continue my enjoyment of extreme music. TTEOTD's \"Bloodlust\u201d was the first album bought that got me interested in deathcore, as was WHITECHAPEL\u2019s \u201cThis is Exile\u201d.\n\nNot that I need to defend myself against naysayers and further musical detractors, but I will mention that I am NO deathcore \u201cfanboy\u201d, as I obviously know the difference between death metal and deathcore; never will I think JOB FOR A COWBOY\u2019s \u201cGenesis\u201d is a \u201cdeath metal classic\u201d on par with \u201cBlessed are the Sick\u201d or \u201cButchered at Birth\u201d. The thing is, I love music that interests me, and it\u2019s not always metal. When it comes to metal music, however, I dig bands that try a different approach in which the final outcome is entertaining (after all, that\u2019s what makes metal the amorphous, immortal beast it is, its ability to be altered and reshaped, but still be considered metal). My new interest in deathcore is not without a critical ear, though...obviously a few deathcore bands are simple hacks definately not worth the hype (JOB FOR A COWBOY, THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER), or just plain god-awful shit (EMMURE, WITH BLOOD COMES CLEANSING), but WHITECHAPEL is a band who ended up overcoming the shitstorm and puts out some rather interesting and caustic music, apparently more \u201cdeath\u201d than \u201ccore\u201d for me.\n\nMy interest in WHITECHAPEL also came about due to my long-running fascination with Jack the Ripper (THE best serial killer in my book, as his victims deserved their fate), and that connection paid off in full. \u201cThis is Exile\u201d is an album that\u2019s seen a lot of play time in my CD player and helps paint a bleak, unforgiving musical picture peppered with claustrophobic guitar work, sledgehammering drumming and insideous vocals churning out some rather well-written lyrics (a rarity in both death and extreme metal these days), with a production that leaves the music as dark and unforgiving as it can possibly be. And yes, I forgive the band\u2019s usage of breakdowns, as at times they can be used intelligently and help the music flow well into the more deathy riffs (\u201cPossessed\u201d, \u201cFather of Lies\u201d and the title track being prime examples). Said riffing is also well performed and, actually, quite memorable, both the crushing death metal bludgeoning and melodic calisthenics now somewhat common in the genre. Another high mark given to the band is their lack of \u201cpig squealing\u201d vocals, which is a definate plus; nothing but non-stop bitter growls and screams, very above average for such a young band, spouting the aformentioned well-written lyrics that have more frightening imagery of death than most modern death/grind bands out there (I\u2019d prefer mind-fuck death lyrics over graphic surgical procedures any day; it shows more creativity).\n\nSo in the end, I seem to have been immersed into deathcore and continue to live to tell the tale. \u201cThis is Exile\u201d isn\u2019t the end-all-be-all death album, but I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t find it a very enjoyable distraction from the menial \u201ctalents\u201d of modern underground metal. It\u2019s any wonder why deathcore strangles metalcore in its sleep to be the more dominant genre these days; some of these bands deserve the attention. These guys are one of them.\n",
        "\nWhat we have here is what I personally would call the perfect combination of the Death and Core elements.This is a good and bad thing.That being said the album has a ton of energy and is actually quite enjoyable. However it does suffer its problems (as expected in any core related metal release ) Time to \"Break\" it \"down\". \n\nPros:\n*I for one enjoyed the contrasting styles the vocalists shows in this album. He manages to throw a variety of styles at you. These include gutturals, death grunts, mid ranged growls,shrieks, and of course the Hard Core screams/ chants. The nice part is each style is never overdone and the vocals change often never leaving you bored.The lyrics aren't bad (nothing special but not totally uninteresting) and the vocalists makes sure you can comprehend him the majority of the time (minus a few gutteral moments).\n\n*These guys have thrown in some very interesting riffs within their songs. They have some nice melodic portions, \\ death metal influenced riffs,darker more black metal sounding riffs, and of course the less intense (but not THAT bad )metal core sounding sections. I enjoyed the majority of the riffs when these guys weren't playing breakdowns. In fact a majority of the stuff played here is well done and very catchy and nice on the ears of metal . However some of the riffs are far from perfect,... but not terrible. You are going to find a ton of influences in this band ranging from Nile to many others.\n\nCons:\n\n*Of course you already saw this coming with a death core release. The lame uninspired breakdowns that are found throughout this album. Don't get me wrong I'm no metal elitist that hates anything core related, but come on we don't need a breakdown leading into a breakdown. These aren't interesting breakdowns , I'm talking your standard generic core break downs with one note, and the vocalist chanting something. To the band: WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS IN EVERY FUCKING SONG! Most songs are often packed with (but not entirely enough for me to hate the music as with some bands) of these breakdowns.\n\n*Three fucking guitars? That is totally unnecessary for a core band to have this many guitarists, or any band for the matter. The bass is totally covered by guitar and often I can never hear it, minus in a few spots in a few songs.\n\n*Shitty electronic sections, do I even need to explain? Cheesy string synth at times as well, this has no place in death metal.\n\n*The song \"Of Legions\", an instrumental. The riffs are for the most part boring and overplayed and the breakdowns rear their ugly head most of the time.\n\nOther Points:\n\n*White Chapel has shifted away from their former lyrical content of Jack the Ripper and moved onto other things. The lyrics consist of Armageddon, new world order, the purging of mankind, and the traditional death metal subject of murder and hunting down someone, and watching them die. I for one am glad, as the earlier subject of Jack the Ripper consisted of mutilating prostitutes, and I for one believe this subject matter is generic,boring, overused and misogynistic. So good job on that guys.\n\nFinal Words:\n\nThese guys get a 70 as a final score. If they took out the breakdowns the said score would be much higher. If you're into Death Metal give this album a listen and you \"may\" like it. Any fan of Death core I assure you, you will really enjoy this album. While Death core (in my opinion) is a flawed genre these guys actually pulled it off quite well.\n",
        "\nI had the misfortune of seeing Whitechapel on Summer Slaughter \u201908 tour, well actually I blame myself for going to that shitty tour but it\u2019s hard to miss the chance to see Vader and Kataklysm aye? So anyway Whitechapel was opening and I knew they were deathcore so I wasn\u2019t expecting much. I was against the railing in the venue and there was a small guy standing next to me, decked out in a sideways hat, sagging tight jeans that were definitely girls pants, a Job for a Cowboy shirt and an arm band that said ATL. Wow, where to begin\u2026 he turned to me and said, \u201cDude I\u2019m so fuckin\u2019 \u2018cited bout fuckin\u2019 Whitechapel man! So fuckin\u2019 brutal bro, you like death metal?\u201d I preceded to turn around and ignore him knowing full well he knew nothing about death metal. I finally told him politely to go back to listening to rap or listen to real death metal like Vader and Kataklysm. \n\nAnyway the show began and it was literally 15 minutes of breakdowns and pathetic fans headbanging to every brutal breakdown and throwning the \u2018claw\u2019 and making those stupid fucking expressions, like as if you were actually holding a hot burning piece of coal. So I take it the horns is gone? Yeah who needs to horns, that\u2019s for old guys like Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi and Lemmy Kilmister\u2026 \n\nOh yeah, Whitechapel. So they\u2019ve released their second pathetic effort in deathcore/wannabe death metal \u2018music\u2019. It\u2019s obviously so fake, it almost comes off right away as a brutal death metal act, since pretty much every song starts off with deep gutturals that might, just might be a brutal death metal band but end up then turning to high shrieks and more Black Dahlia Murder wannabe switching vocal approach. The instruments here are pathetic; I have never witnessed more of a pathetic guitar tone or even lead guitar. Wait, there is no lead guitar; nothing here other than brief spites of melody and stupidity in \u2018lead\u2019 guitar showmanship. The guitar tone is so weak it\u2019s brittle as a stick, anyone saying this falls under the category of \u2018brutal\u2019 deathCORE don\u2019t know what \u2018brutal\u2019 is. The guitars are compromised of weak guitar riffs that barely find themselves lost behind the drumming annoying vocals; especially in Somatically Incorrect the guitars are only heard about a quarter into the song when the drumming starts. Other than this the only time guitars make a comeback is every other 30 seconds with another god damn breakdown. Breakdowns should be used sparingly like in real metal, Slayer uses them at times but not overwhelmingly, and it makes it good. Fuck this breakdown laden album. Seriously, the only thing heavy on this record is the drumming which at times seems to be competent. That\u2019s the only thing Whitechapel has going for them; and even still it shouldn\u2019t be the case where you listen to any random deathcore band for the drumming, there\u2019s plenty of good drummers out there I could listen to in a real death metal band. \n\nThe bass is there probably who the fuck knows or cares it won\u2019t do anything special if it were or not. The worst part of Whitechapel other than the fans and the breakdowns is obviously the vocals. He goes with a similar approach as what the Black Dahlia Murder does with one vocalist changing styles every once in a while except he takes it further and changes every 5 seconds between 4 different styles. It always starts off a song with ultra low and guttural almost semi-brutal death metal then jumps to high shrieks and then back to typical \u2013core vocals all around and then to completely dumb and unnecessary digitalized vocals that something Chris Barnes or nu Anders Friden would do or something so it\u2019s like almost industrial or fake nu metal tough guy shit. It really makes for something you don\u2019t want to listen to unless you like that fake tough guy fa\u00e7ade with those electronic-esque vocals; but to most metal fans they\u2019ll see right through the bullshit and realize how annoying this guy is. It\u2019s really apparent in the title track featuring some more frantic changing of pace with this guy mixed with more breakdowns, yipee.\n\nThis may seem like a raging anti-deathcore review in pure spite, well it\u2019s not really. I want to warn you that Whitechapel is deathCORE to the very bone, ignore the idiots saying this is enough metal to be legitimately METAL, when it\u2019s not. Fuck this pathetic band, they are brainwashing people and commercializing extreme music by the masses with it\u2019s accessibility in the sound, it\u2019s pathetic and I can\u2019t understand how any real metalhead can be fooled by this. I want to seriously warn people because I see folks going around all the time telling others that Whitechapel is the band to stick with because it\u2019s brutal deathcore or some form of lies. This is the most stereotypical form of breakdown laden deathcore with an edge of wanting to be \u2018brutal\u2019 by adding in other fake elements in an attempt to trick real metalheads; fortunately we\u2019re smart enough to realize this\u2026 not so much with the other easily brainwashed folk.\n",
        "\nAs you know, there is little to no good deathcore. It was an abomination made by those fake hardcore kids who didn't even know what death metal is, and butcher and painfully masturbate the techniques commonly found in said genre. However, the bible belt's own deathcore heroes called Whitechapel, on the other band, threw in a rather listenable bang for your buck to their even more tolerable recipe for brutality (as far as the core goes). Showing plenty of influence in death metal, and then some. Its like death metal with strategically placed breakdowns, and some of these breakdowns are peppered with the influence of Meshuggah, believe it or not (check out 'Possession' and be the judge yourself).\n\nNow I will sway from the comparing and contrasting, and move on to the more vital part of this review: constructive critique.\n\nThere is plenty of intensity to be found. However, that intensity is coming from an excessive abundance of guitarists, and all those guitars are seven stringed. Now, one may consider this a mode of 'cheating' to achieve this intensity. Perhaps not based on the sole purpose of the use of seven string guitars, as that would be an invalid speculation. Instead, the peculiar instance that they find it necessary to have three guitarists when they could have just settled for just two. Or, to impress a few people, only one. With that said, the guitarwork of Wade, Householder and Savage is notable in the name of deathcore, but nothing a cut above.\n\nTo better clarify this criticism, I do not ENTIRELY condone in disagreement with the angel Whitechapel have chosen to take. I do praise them for their brutality. As far as deathcore goes, but by no means brutal within the generality of death metal. As previously stated, you will find some strong death influence. Also, pure grind influence. Which may appear to be minutiae, or completely oblivious to a handful of people.\n\nI was also surprised to learn that the drummer has some good chops. Skillful, if not technical; the blast beats and d-beats alike are fast, comprehensible and can be heard clearly. I was surprised because not that many deathcore-based drummers know how to blast beat. They are often slow and extremely inconsistent with the tempo of the guitarwork (which isn't any better). But when they are not slow, they are only being abused. However, Lane's drumming is proportionate to the tempo and rhythm throughout each song. Everything is not entirely predictable. To an extent, it is actually unpredictable for all its worth.\n\nLastly, Bozeman's vocals are very well done, and his gutturals and mid-high screams are distributed, where much needed vocal structure is due for this already substantial album. These lyrics are nothing you would expect from a sub-genre of this infamous stature. Both the gore and womanizing overtures may be overdone, no matter what kind of death you listen to. However, it takes craft and subtlety to make it sound just right. No matter how morally wrong it has already sounded, and will. Yet, with more than one theme being employed, it makes everything all worth while.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where I feel like I can pinpoint exactly what kind of metalcore a band plays. In this case, we\u2019ve got melodic deathcore. Guitar melodies which often intertwine with each other moving, between dual attacks like lines supported by chords, shifting into harmonies. A few are Swedish, others are a bit nastier and have some more inspiration. The death metal is present in the form of blast beats, Smith blasts, tremolo picked riffs, and powerful low growls that are similar Nate Johnson (Since The Flood, ex-Deadwater Drowning, ex-Through The Eyes Of The Dead) screaming at you live, mixing them with plenty of screamed harsh harmonies. Then you\u2019ve got the metalcore from the odd high skronks, single note breakdowns and Acacia Strain style tritone breakdowns, and finally the grindcore from the huge tempo jumps.\n\nIt\u2019s all tight, well executed, catchy, and pretty intense, but also completely lacking curveballs. If melodic deathcore was a competition (which the scene be sometimes), then I\u2019d count Through The Eyes Of The Dead as the leader of that specific variant because they\u2019re moving away from some of the standard conventions, trading in a lot of their single-note breakdowns for more metal style breakdowns and tempo rising slams into a place I\u2019ve personally tagged as post-metalcore, which would of course make them post-melodic deathcore. I swear if that tag catches on, people are going to be very mad at me for all the genre tags that are out there already.\n\nIn the end, for the formula that Whitechapel represents, they\u2019ve dowe well, but looking back at earlier deathcore attempts also brings to mind Deadwater Drownings self-titled EP back in 2003 and \u201cWe are Gathered Here Today\u201d by Glass Casket in 2004. Those albums might fit into that world of deathcore quite nicely, but they also stand head and shoulders above their peers in originality, strength, and inspiration.\n\nMy message in the end? Great job from Whitechapel. I\u2019m also sure the scene kids will suck this one right up, as well as those modern death metal/deathcore kids. If this bands talent is taken to the next step with some creative left turns, then that\u2019ll be something to get excited about, and grow past the standard scene. Until then, \u201cThis is Exile\u201d is fun, but only for right this very moment.\n\nOriginally posted at www.waytooloud.com\n",
        "\nWhitechapel, a band that has earned countless fans in and outside of the walls of the Deathcore genre. I normally run like the plague to escape bands of this genre, but I gave these guys a chance. I\u2019ve always said that the reason I don\u2019t listen to Deathcore isn't because it\u2019s Deathcore, rather I don\u2019t listen to it because I think the majority of Deathcore bands are abominable, breakdown starved, shit mongering, clones. After making a statement like that, I couldn\u2019t exactly refuse to listen to this album when it was recommended to me, at least not if the reason was based on the fact that it was Deathcore without looking like a total hypocrite.\n\nI approached this album expecting nothing more than the average Deathcore, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The riffs are more than segues to breakdowns here, in fact, they\u2019re the main attraction. The majority of the riffs aren\u2019t particularly \u2013core related, instead they seem to be far closer to the Death Metal side of the fence. While they aren\u2019t going to be confused for a Nile riff, they have just the right amount of \u2013core influence to make them original Death Metal riffs, rather than tired Deathcore riffs. The riffs are generally heavy, but there are quite a few melodic sections which help to add some contrast and show off a bit more of the guitarists' skills. The best one of these mini solos is in Festering Fiesta. \n\nUnfortunately, all is not perfect from a riff based sense. Whitechapel\u2019s riffs barely resemble Deathcore at all, and they were evidently afraid of being ostracized from the steaming turd of a genre. In an attempt to get back into their Neanderthal friend\u2019s good graces, they resorted to a simple tactic. They packed every song to the brim with breakdowns. These aren\u2019t the well thought out breakdowns of a band like The Red Chord, and they don\u2019t pack the pummeling brutality of a Slam band like Devourment. These are the lowest of the low; these are the dreaded traditional Deathcore breakdowns. There are a handful of good breakdowns to be found on this album (Articulo Mortis, Fairy Fay) but they are rare and far between. The rest of the album is filled with the generic, soulless and horrid breakdowns that plague a band like Waking the Cadaver. (Okay, they aren\u2019t THAT bad) Every song has at least two or three breakdowns, and they drag the quality of the music down into the gutter in quite a few cases. They disrupt any kind of flow that the album might have possessed, and prevent the majority of the songs from being enjoyed straight through without a wince every few seconds. To get to the interesting and unique riffing, you have to wade through miles of knee deep breakdown consistency shit. While a breakdown once in a while can propel a song to new (and brutal) heights, they are overused to a sickening extent here. \n\nThe pacing of the album is generally good, and it doesn't get too repetitive due to its short length. Unfortunately, there is one slightly baffling pacing blunder which occurs very early on in the album. The first track (which also happens to be the title track) ends in a truly perplexing fashion.The end comprises of some classical music. While on an individual track basis it works as a great ending, I think it was a bad idea to place it at the end of the first track. It felt like it would have worked far better at the end of the album, and reset the tension levels back to what they had been before the title track had begun. \n\nThe guitars are generally done well. They aren\u2019t particularly technical, but they don\u2019t need to be. They are suitably heavy when necessary, and can also be quite melodic at times. There are quite a few parts where two of the three guitars are creating a harmony and this offers good contrast to the standard brutality of the album. Unfortunately, the guitars aren\u2019t flawless. This isn\u2019t due to any faults in their playing, but rather due to the fact that (for some idiotic reason) there are three of them. Two would have been more than enough for any of the harmonies presented here, and more than enough for any of the standard riffs or breakdowns. The third guitar never causes any specific problems, but it completely drowns out the bass which sacrifices an extra degree of heaviness that the band might have been able to achieve without it and it offers no positives to make up for this injury.\n\nThe drummer is head and shoulders above almost any other Deathcore drummer I\u2019ve heard. He doesn\u2019t rely on blast beats as a crutch, instead he uses them only when it would fit the music and add an extra degree of drive and heaviness. Quite often he uses rapid paced double bass drumming, similar to a band like Nile (although he never approaches George Kollias in speed). During the breakdowns they manage to be quite heavy and are one of the few redeeming aspects of these parts. His tone is also quite good, and escapes the flat and powerless drum tone that countless other Deathcore drummers use. The only exception is the hi hat, which, while not bad is sometimes grating. Still, the only example where it actually annoyed me was in the title track and it isn\u2019t a particularly big problem.\n\nThe vocals are another standout here. Instead of the standard (and atrocious) Deathcore pig squeals, these are very varied and always done well. They range from a lower guttural (similar to Dying Fetus), to a more traditional death growl, to a higher shriek. The lyrics are very well thought out and the album is based off of the exploits of Jack the Ripper. While some liberties are taken, they follow the story quite well and are suitably twisted. They are somewhat understandable too, while you won\u2019t hear every word they are far from the unintelligible gurgles of a band like Cock and Ball Torture. \n\nOverall this is very good for a Deathcore album. If it were not for the breakdowns, it would probably score in the seventies. Still, due to their atrocious presence, its score is unfortunately dragged down. Despite this, I urge you to check this band out if you, like me, generally dislike Deathcore. This band managed to avoid instant deletion (unlike the majority of their fellows) and I will check out their upcoming album, which, hopefully will tone done the suffocating amount of breakdowns. Standout tracks include: Ear to Ear, Festering Fiesta, Articulos Mortis, and Fairy Fay.\n",
        "\nI obtained this album for quite interesting purposes. After a scathing MySpace rant delivered by one of the anti-core metalheads, calling more or less every band to become somewhat popular after 2005 \"JFAC-Worship,\" I checked out a few of the bands that were apparently so horrible. One of the better bands I found was Whitechapel.\n\nThe influence of Job For a Cowboy and similar bands is evident, but there is also a considerable amount of slam death influences (I know a lot of people seem to have strong opinions about slam, almost as much as deathcore, but it applies), evident on such tracks as \"Viscer Exiser.\" There is also influence from some older Death and Black Metal, as seen a bit on \"Fairy Fay.\"\n\nThe band does have 3 guitars and a bass, but truthfully, two of these could be dropped. The only situation the third guitar has any use is continuing the breakdown during the harmonized solo on \"Ear to Ear.\" The band talk about further harmonies, but they are not highlighted on this album.\n\nThe drums are a refreshing change from most deathcore, at least as far as tone. No deathcore band would be caught without a double-bass pedal, and most of them have horribly tinny and fake-sounding drums. Whitechapel finally had the common sense to stuff some goddamn blankets in the drum and get a lower, 'thud'-like tone. The drumming itself isn't much different from the rest of the popular deathcore bands these days: Blast, slam, blast, slam, breakdown. Horribly stereotypical, but it goes with the music well.\n\nIf you're looking for revolutionary lyrics (though the Jack The Ripper theme is interesting and while gory, at least a little more unique than most bands), experimental music, extreme technicality or a true progressive sound, this isn't your album. But if you're only looking for a little solid deathcore, The Somatic Defilement will not disappoint.\n",
        "\nAfter thoroughly listening to this album, I've decided to change my rating. \n\nMany many people on this site are aware of the mediocrity of the \"deathcore\" genre. From such acts as Job for a Cowboy, Bring Me the Horizon, Suicide Silence, and other embarrassing excuses for bands. But when it comes to music, Whitechapel are quite the contrary. They are not the typical deathcore band with the scene kid hair and open-string breakdowns. These guys mean business.\n\nThe Somatic Defilement is in no way revolutionary or even near groundbreaking, but provides the listener with well made deathcore. It's really hard to say you like a deathcore band but for many death metal fans, this is a guilty pleasure. Now to get to the music. There are three guitarists, but this isn't very noticeable at all due to the lack of solos and chuggy/slam riffs. Rarely, you can hear triple harmonization. Now to the vocals...deathcore is known for its typical shit faux-lows and screams. Whitechapel implement screams but in a way such as Benighted. The vocalist does perform lows very well and has a wide ranged voice. The drumming is typical. Blast and then breakdown and then slam groove. \n\nMany death metal influences are found in this album. Such as the somewhat grind part of \"Festering Fiesta\" and the brutal death metal influences in \"Vicer Exciser\". A lot of this shit is catchy, beware. The lyrics are borderline pathological and are pretty cool. This album DOES have many breakdowns. If you can tolerate them, then you will be fine. Other than that, with crushing rolls (The Somatic Defilement) to moshing d-beats (Vicer Exciser) to extreme lows (Fairy Fay). The Somatic Defilement is a satisfying album.\n\nIf you can tolerate breakdowns, repetition, and deathcore screams then purchase this album.\n\nHighlights: Vicer Exciser, Festering Fiesta, The Somatic Defilement\nSome cool riffs +\nGood drumming +\nGood vocals +\nCool lyrics +\nLame cover art -\nSome lame breakdowns -\nDeathcore -\nRepetition -\n",
        "\nWhitechapel - The Somatic Defilement, I've head a lot about this release from friends. Two of them went as far as to claim this as their album of the year. I've listened to the album in its entirety twice now and I'm not impressed.\n\n\nThe general sound here is mid to slow tempo deathcore, wit a heavy focus on slow breakdowns. There is a high variance of vocal styles, unfortunately however most of the vocals are annoying and unconvincing. All of the deliveries reek of Doom EP worship. The Domm Ep influence can actually be heard on most of the album as a whole either directly or indirectly.\n\n\nThe Guitars (all three of them) have a generically heavy sound, managing to be distorted but to sound too sterile at the same time. As for the guitar parts themselves, they are allegedly played by 3 guitars, but it seems to me that a reasonably skilled guitar player could play 60-70% of this without double tracking. I guess the other guitars are there so they can chug extra hard on the breakdowns. In the more melodic parts some a hint of At The Gates worship sneaks in ala The Black Dahlia Murder. Guitar solos? Don't hold your breath, the only thing here is a little toned down melodic cheese in between breakdowns. No solos proper. Also most of the breakdowns lose all of their impact due to being telegraphed out so far that you'd need to be retarded not to predict when they're coming up.\n\n\nThe drum performance here is one of the most emotionally desolate that I have ever heard. Absolutely no individuality or feeling is conveyed at all. Fortunately the drummer often drops down to half time cymbal hits over either 8th notes or just slow speed groove beats, when he does this he is easily ignored.\n\n\nThe bass may as well be non-existent most of the time due to being buried under 3 guitars, but I suppose it adds to the heaviness of a few of the breakdowns. No real complaints here due to simply not being able to here it for better or worse.\n\n\nAll in all, a few of the breakdowns are satisfyingly heavy, and this is also far from the worst deathcore album I've head. Still, there is virtually nothing this album has to offer that hasn't been done a hundred times better. Not recommended to anyone who doesn't have a razor fringe and a septum piercing.\n"
