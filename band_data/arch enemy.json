        "\nEver since I started listening to metal music, I have come across Arch Enemy on numerous occasions. While the occasional song was much appreciated at different parties, I could never listen to one of the group's records from start to finish because the vocals ended up sounding nerve-firing, the song structures were at times repetitive and the musicianship overall lacked diversity. To my surprise, the numerous singles preceding the release of Deceivers all struck a chord with me and I decided to give the full length effort a chance. I'm glad to announce that Deceivers is indeed a very good album that entertains from start to finish through forty-five highly entertaining minutes.\n\nArch Enemy has managed to find a perfect balance between its melodic soundscapes and its aggressive side. The former is represented by cleverly employed atmospheric keyboard sounds and additional effects, numerous memorable guitar melodies and solos and an increased use of catchy clean vocals. This approach shines in creative, diversified and dynamic opener ''Handshake with Hell'', dreamy, slow and tender highlight ''Poisoned Arrow'' and instrumental interlude ''Mourning Star'' that offers both an atmospheric break and showcases the talent of the involved musicians.\n\nThose who like the band's harsher side don't need to be afraid however. This record is still filled with devilish harsh vocals, fast guitar riffs and dynamic rhythm section. ''Deceiver, Deceiver'' for instance reminds of Swedish melodic death metal in the key of At the Gates, In Flames and Soilwork in the nineties. ''Sunset of the Empire'' opens with a bumblebee bass guitar solo before sinister vocals and fast riffs kick in but the song is also balanced by melodic guitar play, cinematic choirs and minimal symphonic passages. Album closer ''Exiled from Earth'' combines unchained vocals with extraordinary guitar solos and evokes a fitting epic atmosphere to conclude an outstanding album.\n\nIn my humble opinion, Arch Enemy's Deceivers is easily the greatest album I have ever listened to from this band. Especially the use of occasional clean vocals, numerous memorable guitar melodies and symphonic keyboard arrangements strikes a chord with me. It should also help make an already commercially successful band even more famous. However, I could imagine several fans of old date who favour the group's classic melodic death metal soundscapes being unhappy about this more harmonious direction. Time shall tell where the band goes from here but it's promising that the international group has managed to release such an amazing twelfth album twenty-seven years into its career. I'm certain that this band still has much to say!\n",
        "\nThis is definitely a solid more consistently good release than their predecessor 'Will To Power'. It has good rhythms and melodies that they seemed to go back to but never as good as the first 3 Arch Enemy albums in their established discography. I don't think it's ever going to be what it once was but at least they're making new albums. Alissa has better vocals than Angela to me but Johan fit in the first 3 releases. They had hallmark rhythms in the early days that 'Deceivers' seemed to touch upon. And with Jeff Loomis on lead guitar fits where Nick I don't think did and Christopher yes in the early days.\n\nAE is Michael's band after he left Carcass spending time working on two albums with them 'Necroticsm' and 'Heartwork'. I suppose he wanted his own style of melodic melodies and so forth. 'War Eternal' got a lot of negative press too being there were only 3 songs that I care to listen to. But 'Deceivers' seems to be a rebirth of magic melodies that they've constructed. And Alissa is consistent as well lighting up with her brutal vocals some clean, too! But not many at that. I believe that this is an album with multiple combinations of clean, heavy and heavier guitars with Jeff contributing his lead guitar amazing licks.\n\nIt seems as though there's multiple contributions in the songwriting, though I believe Michael still has the bulk of the songwriting and melodies. This is a pretty fresh hitting release but with Angela, 'Wages of Sin' probably was her best. For Alissa, this is her best most diverse attack on the vocal department. These guys refuse to go away. I tell you, some of the songs they released before this album came out I didn't like. But when I heard the whole album it reigned supreme. It's not entirely brutal, there are segments of clean vocals and melodies. But it seemed to fit in the direction it took with a more progressive type of melodic death.\n\nI had to order this CD because I think it's one that I'm going to play to death. A lot on here I hold to be true to what metal I'm in favor of. The guitars have a lot of highlights. And the vocals as well. Production quality is fantastic which made the album more likable. I didn't rate this higher than a \"B\" because I think it didn't hit higher than that mark. Pose more melodic riffs I would've probably hit a higher score of. But yes, this didn't to me deserve any negative marks really. A really well arranged melodic death metal release that they can chalk up to a successful contribution to the metal community.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy was the first band with harsh vocals I listened to voluntarily. The excellent riff work and strong melodic themes of \u2018The Immortal\u2019 made me think of them as a heavy metal band with that type of vocals rather than a melodic death metal band. \u2018Deceivers\u2019 is the first Arch Enemy album in a long time that I unequivocally like, however. While the band has a clearly defined style, they frequently crossed the line towards the stale and formulaic over the last two decades. \u2018Deceivers\u2019 remedies that by mixing up the song structures and dynamics. Slight, but very notable changes.\n\nNot all recent Arch Enemy releases were quite as bland as \u2018Khaos Legions\u2019, but they got increasingly predictable. Especially the \u2018Nemesis\u2019 formula \u2013 vicious opening, anticlimactic chorus with trite lyrics \u2013 was repeated too much for my liking, while anyone could predict which type of song would be where in the tracklisting. While nobody would mistake \u2018Deceivers\u2019 for any other band, song structures in particular are less predictable than usual. The most melodic part of the songs isn\u2019t always the chorus. In fact, the raging \u2018Deceiver, Deceiver\u2019 doesn\u2019t even have an overtly melodic part, despite it being where the \u2018Nemesis\u2019 knockoff would usually be.\n\n\u2018Handshake With Hell\u2019 is quite a daring opener. It ostensibly is the uptempo, but not too fast kind of opener Arch Enemy usually goes for, but with Alissa White-Gluz putting her fantastic alto to good use in the pre-chorus and then again in the surprisingly calm middle section, it is enough of a twist to keep me interested. Another welcome improvement on \u2018Deceivers\u2019 is the return of actual thrashing riffs. \u2018The Watcher\u2019, the aforementioned \u2018Deceiver, Deceiver\u2019 and \u2018Sunset Over The Empire\u2019 have an amount of speedy momentum that the band's post-\u2018Wages Of Sin\u2019 albums were lacking, except for maybe parts of \u2018War Eternal\u2019.\n\nOne advantage of the approach on \u2018Deceivers\u2019 is that the variation makes the more typical Arch Enemy songs are easier to get through. The mid-tempo hardrock-inspired \u2018In The Eye Of The Storm\u2019 might have made many Arch Enemy albums drag, but it\u2019s actually a nice change of pace here. Likewise, \u2018Poisoned Arrow\u2019 would have been just another one of their tracks on any other album, but actually works quite well in this context. \u2018House Of Mirrors\u2019, with its melodic progressions reminiscent of Dark Tranquillity, is another excellent melodeath track, while I really like the subdued darkness in the atmosphere of closing track \u2018Exiled From Earth\u2019.\n\n\u2018Deceivers\u2019 isn\u2019t perfect. Jeff Loomis is still severely underutilized. In terms of playing, I understand, with him being in Seattle and the rest of the band in Sweden. But for god\u2019s sake, the man was part of arguably the best songwriting duo in modern metal, at least let him contribute more. Also, I think White-Gluz could add even more variation to her vocal approach without the results sounding too unlike the band\u2019s other work. But as it stands, \u2018Deceivers\u2019 is easily my favorite Arch Enemy album since \u2018Wages Of Sin\u2019. The songwriting and production tropes that bored me senseless have not disappeared entirely, but experimenting with the way they are structured is a massive improvement.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018House Of Mirrors\u2019, \u2018Deceiver, Deceiver\u2019, \u2018The Watcher\u2019, \u2018Handshake With Hell\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nI find it quite amusing that Arch Enemy somehow still has fans looking forward to their music, especially seeing how the band has been in a downward spiral ever since Alissa White-Gluz took over as the vocalist. It's especially frustrating since there was a time where Arch Enemy was a respected band in the melodic death metal scene. Their first three albums were really good, and I enjoyed much of Angela Gossow's work in the band. But since the release of \"War Eternal\", the band has only sunk deeper into a pit of blandness that has only grown stronger with this latest album release.\n\nThe album begins with the track \"Handshake with Hell\". It starts off with a guitar noodling around before the rest of the instruments kick in. The guitars play a harsh riff that also sounds melodic, the drumming can get intense at times, and the bass follows along the guitars with its deep-tuned bassplays. And that's about all I can say with this track. One of the main issues I have with modern Arch Enemy is that they do establish some form of instruments, but they never do anything with them. Here, however, they've somehow gotten even worse, where I end up forgetting these instrumentals as soon as they end. The only actual highlights in the instruments would be with the singles like \"Deceiver, Deceiver\". And even then, not only do they take up six of the eleven tracks on this album, they sound more or less the same like every other track on this release. I expected the album to sound like what they've been doing for the last two albums, but even with this expectation, they still somehow go even lower with some of the most generic instrumentals in melodic death metal history,\n\nAs for the vocals, they're also about what you expect from the band. Now, Alissa White-Gluz's is no bad vocalist by any means, as I've actually enjoyed her performances in her previous band The Agonist. But like the instruments, her voice has also fell into mediocracy. Her vocal delivery is the exact same as the last two releases, with deep growls mixed with melodic singing. Not only that, but they also sound the exact same in each song, to a point where I literally can't find any standalone performances. Yeah, the growl can sound harsh at times, and even the singing can be good, but they're just that, and don't really enhance the instrumentals at all.\n\nEven the lyrics are trash. Okay, they're not actually terrible, but they don't really say anything worthy. To see what I mean, check out this verse from \"Spreading Black Wings\":\n\nOh, morning star\nSon of the dawn\nFallen from grace\nDo not fear to tread\nThe left-hand path\nI am here\nSpreading black wings\n\nWell, apart from the lyrics looking like they were written by an AI, the story is rather bland and overly simplified, and doesn't really give enough details on going to the left-hand path. Furthermore, the instruments and vocals don't enhance this much, as the generic riffs and drumming fails to amplify the emotions in the story, and Alissa's growls even come off as an exaggeration on what's happening. These are easily the worst lyrics in Arch Enemy's discography, and don't really say anything about the album at all.\n\nYou know, it's really sad to see albums like this be on the forefront of the genre, as that only confirms the criticisms of melodic death metal being made up of nothing but generic trash. Melodic death metal can be good if done right, and bands like At the Gates, In Flames, Sacrilege, and the criminally underrated Intestine Baalism have already prove that. But at this point, it's clear that Arch Enemy has long outlived their lifespan, and unless they can somehow pull off another Wages of Sin, I think this is the last album of theirs I will be checking out.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy is a band that I only like- I don't love them, but it's clear that main songwriter and last founding member still in the band, Michael Amott, has lost the passion when it comes to this band. At his best, he makes incredible material for the band- Hell, he writes fantastic instrumentation in his other bands, but Arch Enemy has slowly decomposed, becoming more and more generic by the release (With some occasional gems where you wouldn't expect them). I'd say the only life in the band is Alissa White-Gluz, who puts in wonderful vocal work here.\n\nIt's aggravating because I've seen nothing but praise for the song, most notably for how 'heavy' it is. Chugging that's generic for even deathcore doesn't count as heavy. Even \"As the Pages Burn\" (Which I absolutely love) is a shining example of heaviness done right in comparison to this. The instrumentation, save for a cool solo, is completely on autopilot here. I didn't love Will To Power, but it was still competent at its worst (That I remember of), and it had some surprisingly wonderful songs, like \"Reason to Believe\".\n\nWhat's becoming depressingly clear over time is that, aside from a few rare instances, they're not going to use Alissa's phenomenal clean singing, and that's a huge shame. Don't get me wrong, her harsh vocals are just as good, and I'd rather those be prevalent than her clean vocals, but they would provide some freshness in a band that's pretty much completely stale. The talents of Jeff Loomis are fucking wasted here, and it's really depressing to see that.\n\nArch Enemy has become mediocre. Aside from some rare stuff that's either really good or laughably bad, they put out rather generic, mediocre material. If they were just another band with fuck all for people, that'd be one thing, but every member in the band fucking oozes talent. They're all awesome musicians when they're at their best. I can't even call Amott a has-been because he can still put out excellent material when the passion's there. However, it just seems like whoever is writing the material is down and out, and that's a shame because I know that if everyone contributed their very best, Arch Enemy would be a goddamn tour-de-force that I would have amongst my favorite bands. Given what we have, I only like them.\n",
        "\nRight off the bat the question at this point, after a sixth Arch Enemy release and given the somewhat obvious nature of their music, is necessarily the following: is this going to be a rehashed version of the previous record; more radio-friendly melodeath; or is the band actually going to make an effort to come up with a fresh feel to 'Doomsday Machine' ? The answer is the second, surprisingly. It still sounds mainstream, but it's different enough from 'Anthems' that it deserves an ear. This is 2005 and the band had already conquered enough territory and won their pivotal battles thus expanding their notoriety and sphere of influence, from a young audience to the more seasoned metal listeners. They were an already well established force in the field and had crossed over to the relative mainstream, as metal music exactly around the time the previous 'Anthems of Rebellion' came out was starting to reach outside its niche audience and started converting a few non-metal individuals into casual metal listeners. \n\nMusic like mid-2000's Arch Enemy was highly melodic, had excellent sparkly production not far from that of actual radio music, and this band in particular had a female lead vocalist with intelligible and tolerable screams rather than a fat old male guttural growler. The straightforward songs were structured simply enough for the mainstreamer to have no difficulty following and enjoying the plot (although not purely patterned on verse/chorus/verse/chorus), and those compact songs rarely made it way past 4min in length. There was also now little dissonance, all-out prog or experimental going on, so the songs had that obvious development and punchline to them. \n\nSo back to this one here: oddly enough, the band don't just give in and produce an Arch Enemy pop record. The songs are now a bit longer, the album contains a couple of instrumental tracks including one that's very fusion-sounding and full on prog, and although this is hardly underground metal by any stretch, what it does manage to do is sound authentic and like it's got a spirit of its own. It wouldn't be fair to call this album a lifeless formulaic template-filling release as the effort to make this a distinct sounding record with its own momentum is definitely there. Not on every single song, but it's there for the most part. The various tracks mostly sound distinctly separate and bring a different dynamic to the whole. \n\nThe opening instrumental intro is engaging and epic sounding in its own right, and the first full song 'Taking Back my Soul' doesn't reinvent the wheel but lets the listener understand this is going to be well-written trademark Arch Enemy but not just an extension of 'Anthems'. This is new material and it sounds fresh. Next, 'Nemesis' is the single off the album and is cheesy as hell all the way through but somehow still listenable (if one can block out the lyrics on the chorus). 'My Apocalypse' sort of comes out of nowhere with its well thought out odd arrangements (the recurring submarine sample) and its most peculiar flavor for an Arch Enemy song; notably a rare slower doomy groove for a verse, a full dedicated clean part in the middle with a practically psychedelic-inspired feel (even some flanger on the drum overheads). Now 4 tracks in, just when one might think this is turning generic again, 'Carry the Cross' comes on and it's some of the most inspired the band had been in a while with a genuinely strong main melody, a well worked steady buildup from the shady verse to the more intense and sorrowful pre-chorus before the chorus comes on, full-on double kicks and that nice sinister main melody comes on again. Behold, 'I Am Legend' which after its riffy metal anthem intro actually packs...a blast beat section, as lampooned as it sounds. 'Skeleton Dance' is along with 'Nemesis' the best example on the album of what Disney-ready Arch Enemy catering to an audience outside metal would sound like, with its sexy/dancy tune. Ironically past the second instrumental ('Hybrid of Steel') the tracks are honestly decent in quality but at this point, who's still there paying full attention ? The listener will feel like he's done after 8 tracks of this. What's more, two of those last three are 6min and 5min respectively, among the longest on here.\n\nIt's clear what this album could've done to improve itself: cut out a lot of it, 49min and 11 tracks of this is just too much and nobody's going to listen through the whole thing with enthusiasm, and instead spend more time enhancing the first 8 or so tracks. There are probably by anyone's standards too many solos here, which spontaneously raises the question of why they're there in such quantities: are the guitarists just deliberately jizzing all over their own riffs solely for personal gratification (glorification ?), or are there fans who seriously want to listen to combined minutes per track of generic bluesy/harmonic minor shredding and redundant phrasing ? Not clear at all. Perhaps they thought it was a selling point for younger, more naive and easily impressionable fans. Getting rid of the absolute cheese found in a couple of full songs, and in parts in other tracks, would've been nice but it's understandable why it's there. Realistically, had the album just been Tracks 1 - 2 - 4 - 5 - 8 with the rest being a patchwork of the better moments from the other existing tracks; forming about 3 songs from that; this could've really been a pretty damn good album by any standard for metal music.\n\nThe band would naturally go on to become more and more mainstream, releasing trendy albums in a trendy era and becoming a sort of SMB/family business hiring an even sexier and more current screaming front-lady to replace the aging Angela Gossow who would become sort of the band's manager. As far as the brains and motors of the Arch Enemy sound, the song-writers Amott brothers probably had come to a point of saturation anyways, at least as far as producing new Arch Enemy music. The band's real lifespan was arguably 5 albums and a bit less than a decade (starting with 1996's Black Earth) and this album 'Doomsday' here might've been one album too many, or perhaps only just the very limit. Arch Enemy managed to create a style over the years that was strongly popular for quite a while, but seemed to have not been able to adapt to the modern era without \"selling its soul to the Devil\" so to speak, and demonstrated poor durability and a quite brief shelf-life. From the albums that we do cherish, the band came up with some of the better Swedish melodeath from that time, and although they undeniably tasted prominence in that field, they arguably never quite reached greatness on those albums. Fell short of it every time. This is Arch Enemy's own Doomsday. So long Arch Enemy.\n",
        "\n'Wages of Sin' ushered in the new era of Arch Enemy's brand of melodic death metal now more focused on precision riffing and on power metal inspired, lead-oriented songs. It had gotten rid of the band's more rustic edge from the original Johan Liiva led trilogy and pushed the direction of the music towards a more mainstream format. The length of the tracks had already shortened on 'Burning Bridges' but were now; on 'Wages' and this album 'Anthems' here; definitively compact with simple song structures and the objective to deliver hard hitting melodeath with a clear hook that could cater to a much wider audience than just niche fans of extreme metal. Some moments on 'Wages' still retained traces of actual death metal with more sinister riffing and darker songs ('Savage Messiah') but on this album the focus would be entirely on writing polished, efficient, speedy metal that only conserved the screaming and heaviness from extreme metal.\n\nThe verses are almost exclusively thrashy power chord grooves with that wide modern metal tone that was introduced to the genre with the new millennium, along with Megadeth inspired rapid single-note riffing. The tremolo picking that's such a backbone for the genre is only sparsely distributed throughout the album, the blast beats are gone entirely, while the solos are mostly guitar hero type stuff (ridden with wah effects, lots of trendy harmonic minor shredding and phrasing, etc). The choruses often bring a bit of an alternative rock edge to the music, which isn't unusual for Swedish melodeath bands at this point in time - 'Dead Eyes See No Future', or 'End of the Line' with its rare backing clean vocals on the chorus.\n\nThere's also a bit of that prog element to certain parts as is traditional for the band, as can be heard on the hot mid-part riff on the opener, 'Silent Wars'; with its broken up uneven time signature, reminiscent of old school death metal breaks; or on the lead section midway into 'Dead Eyes See No Future'. On that same track, the band showcase some of the orchestral arrangements they'll introduced to certain parts to add depth and atmosphere (here, the strings and the military-sounding drum section towards the end), as well as choirs ('Exist to Exit' amongst others). There are even electronic elements occasionally, like the synths on the following track 'Instinct', or the keys on the chorus to 'Dehumanization' with its mysterious allure.\n\nThe album starts off with a very solid foursome, including the highlight 'We Will Rise', but it also maintains a respectable quality afterwards, in particular with tracks like the atmospheric and darkly tinged 'Exist to Exit', the melancholic instrumental 'Marching On a Dead End Road' and its recycled core melody from 'Dead Eyes', or 'End of the Line' with its epic quality, sheer heaviness and unique chorus.\n\nOverall the album of course feels a bit too polished and shallow for the style the band play in, like a sterilized version of the earlier much darker records. A lot of the material can surely be considered sing-along commercial melodeath. However the songs are still written with a certain maturity and definition that weren't there during, say, the band's first two albums, and the songs may not have that quaint charm to them but pack a mean punch and if the listener would just indulge, there's good fun to be had here. It's easy to listen to and not overly simplified to the point of sounding hollow and it redeems itself with catchy tight riff work. Every track usually has at least one genuinely good part in it; whether it's a riff, a chorus, a lead section or otherwise; and the songs are skillfully laid out and constructed, with quality arrangements showing off good variety.\n\nI wouldn't say this album is necessarily below any from the original trilogy (or 'Wages'). I'd say it's different, and it loses some fundamental elements while introducing other compelling aspects that weren't there before to compensate. It isn't the most underground metal album ever, to understate it, but it isn't plastic mallcore either. It's a solid effort with strong moments, a recognizable style and sound to it with plenty of memorable moments, and knowing this band's ceiling that would be sufficient to call this album \"good\".\n",
        "\nThe year is 1999, and as if a symbol at the very turn of the century this would be the band's last ever album featuring lead vocalist Johan Liiva with the band still in their darker incarnation - the end of an era of Arch Enemy being fully considered a true melodic death metal force by all. Where the previous effort 'Stigmata' was solid throughout, it may've been only totally efficient in parts and a tad lackluster in other areas. \n\n'Burning Bridges' here represents the band at their most mature, at least as of the date of this third release in their discography. First of all, production wise it sounds absolutely fantastic. Every instrument sounds full and crisp, whilst maintaining an organic warmth to them and not bending to the temptation of modern overly polished production. The title alone 'Burning Bridges' along with the album cover have a plain yet epic quality to them. The lyrics actually sound compelling in parts whereas they often came across as cheesy on the previous two records. The previous 'Stigmata' sounded dark in tone and production, but in comparison to this one feels a little cloudy and on the murky side.\n\nThe vocals were also a lower pitch before and Liiva now sounds like he's come out of his shell and his performance feels more intense and lively, and just more spirited; as well as more versatile alternating between the more shrieky cries (those can be a bit exaggerated) and the lower husky tones, with even double vocals in places; and there's more dynamism to the vocals on here to go along with the detailed sound of the album. There's less \"mud\" to the instruments in comparison generally speaking.\n\nThe song-writing is sharper here generally, although this album lacks the charm of the instrumental tracks from the previous. Every single song on this album is catchy (however flawed and even tainted for a few) and immediately recognizable within the first seconds and the lead guitars are often used as main musical phrases with a simple and therefor more memorable melody, rather than being expanded embellishments over rhythm guitars as was common practice previously. The tracks are also shorter, but rather because of the band's maturity and ability to deliver more efficiently than to fit a mainstream mold. The music isn't dumbed down. It's rather  enhanced and made more intelligible.\n\nThis review wouldn't be complete without mentioning there's quite a bit of ripping off going on here unfortunately. The chorus on 'Pilgrim' sounds like at least a couple of older songs, while 'Seed Of Hate' is (hopefully) a homage to 'Bark at the Moon'. A lot of tracks also use the descending all-chromatic chord progression that was such a trademark of Mustaine's and Megadeth and although the melodies crafted over those are nice, one can't help but feel the influence is really quite present.\n\nA lot of the lead work still is cheesy on here and sounds flat out naive at times ('Silverwing' lead section, 'Demonic Science' post-chorus lead), and it seems the band can't help but write pseudo-dramatic lead parts with that stereotypical neo-classical backbone; this was the outro to 'Bridge of Destiny' on the previous album, and here the outro to 'Demonic Science'. The album does contain a substantial amount of genuinely pleasant and at times even majestic melody. The aforementioned 'Silverwing' has a euphoric quality from the major scale maneuvering going on, and the intro in particular has that delectable classy melodeath touch.\n\nThe gist of it here is that the album starts off really well with a killer track in 'The Immortal' and ends superbly well with the title-track 'Burning Bridges' and it's got some really enjoyable moments for most fans of the melodeath genre in between, but it's still Arch Enemy and even back in their authentic 90's form there's plenty of cheesy stereotypical crap going on that the listener will possibly have to skim over. Some parts are just pure bluesy cheese, sound way too close to existing heavy metal songs, or just aren't up to the task. A lot of the album is merely pretty cool Swedish melodeath, but that last track in particular is just flat out haunting. The poignant lyrics, the live strings used in the background and the excellent seamless blending of those with heavy melodic guitars and that ponderous doom groove on the drums - where does that sheer depth in atmosphere come from all of a sudden, and where was it during this whole record ?\n\nAs far as I can tell, this isn't better or worse than 'Stigmata'. It's more efficient, more colorful but also not as rustic and darkly charming or nostalgic. They're both good, but flawed records that could've been heaps better, and are both regarded as rare historical treasures in the field as the band would later, permanently, turn to the mainstream.\n",
        "\nAfter a very solid debut album ('Black Earth'), Arch Enemy return with a similar album in texture and style with 'Stigmata', heavy in bass and with a thick girth to the overall sound, ridden with dominant melodic components in every track, in the typical early Swedish melodeath tradition. Although the album did come out relatively late (1998), in feel and production it sounds closer to that first wave of Swedish melodeath, darker and more rustic and underground, and it's not until later during the Angela Gossow records that they start sounding a lot lighter and more polished and by extension more mainstream.\n\nElements of traditional death metal are present here with low tuned thrashy guitar verses, the occasional blast beats or the lower pitched vocals, while the rest is of course highly melodic with solos and leads aplenty, harmonized Maiden-like twin guitars and a heavy use of vibratos. The melodies are usually quite tasteful as they don't necessarily follow completely stereotypical lines as could be associated with the genre (such as trendy harmonic minor riffs which they themselves would adopt en masse afterwards), although they're not ground-breaking with originality either. Some melodic lead work is really quite beautiful as is best displayed on the title-track instrumental, or on the other instrumentals: the mysterious and softly melancholic 'Hydra', and 'Vox Stellarum' with its grand piano crescendo towards the euphoric guitar lead climax.\n\nSome tracks have a bit of that familiar rock n roll vibe for the style, especially on choruses ('Sinister Mephisto'). The songs are well crafted and articulated with engaging starts, punchy verses and with cohesive pre-chorus to chorus patterns, and an additional part after the second chorus, giving the tracks a fuller and more defined identity as well as a bit of complexity so the songs aren't just one main melody and a chorus. Some songs will venture into full instrumental lead territory and introduce a slight progressive element to the album as the part evolves with different key changes and chord progressions. A good example of that would be the middle chunk on 'Let the Killing Begin', with a wild lead harmony part, clean guitars trading off with melodic distortion leads, an ensuing solo etc. It's generally done well enough to sustain itself, although the lead phrasing can get a tad verbose in parts.\n\nSome tracks come off as just dark for the style, something that won't be heard again on later iterations in the band's discography: 'Dark of the Sun', 'Black Earth' with its ominous whole-tone based main riff and intense chorus, the refrain to 'Tears of the Dead' or the intro to the instrumental 'Stigmata' for example. The songs are also fairly lengthy, most being over 5min and a couple reaching a whole 7min plus. The songs would considerably shorten on subsequent records as to fit a more digestible mainstream format with less parts per track and more compact sections.\n\nIt's unfortunate the album ends on a bit of a cheesy note (the outro lead section on 'Bridge of Destiny') which sounds something like kitsch romanticism, and that overall 'Stigmata' couldn't capitalize on its more unique elements. Every time the album goes dark it gets particularly interesting, but it doesn't do it much, and most of the song-oriented material with vocals and riffs is well written versus the full-on lead driven instrumental areas in the tracks that honestly do drag on a bit at times. The band has also always had an element of cheesiness about them and it doesn't show a lot here but it does transpire in parts with some of the more demonstrative sections or flat out shallow riffing and lead work. The instrumental tracks are all really nice though and give this album good cred and a bit more sheer volume, but the groundwork laid here was arguably destined for a better general result and Arch Enemy don't quite squeeze everything out of it. There's a lot of beauty and power in this album's musical soul that's left undiscovered.\n",
        "\n\u201cBlack Earth\u201d is a melodic death metal record that combines the heavy 7-string guitar tone and aggressive swede death metal styled riffing with jumpy and creamy leads that resemble NWOBHM bands. The vocal style for this record, delivered by Johan Liiva, is somehow close to the traditional death metal growl but not as low and deep and definitely more legible, think of Tomas Lindberg as a reference. The bass guitar is present on the mix because the production is top notch and every instrument can be fully heard but in terms of composition is pretty much like another rhythm guitar: played with a pick and slightly distorted. The drumming is aggressive, intense, technical and elegant when using the cymbals, etc; but you will never hear a blast beat or any other citations of real extreme metal on the percussion department of this record and the tempos in general aren\u2019t upbeat.\n\nThere are some mid-paced death n\u2019 roll sections thrown here and there that include basically hard rock riffs played on lower octaves, bridges or solo riffs; the choruses are preferred for the inclusion of the melodic high pitched leads and the verses are the heavier parts with traditional swede DM riffing. The formula is correctly executed throughout the whole album as composition wise this record is very entertaining and easy to listen. I guess that\u2019s precisely the \u201cmagic\u201d of this sub genre, how to present a \u2018chill\u2019 and more digestible approach to the harsh possibilities in tone that were digitally developed in the nineties after the first wave of extreme metal emerged. Besides that, Michael Amott is undoubtedly a gifted songwriter and skilled compositor. Arch Enemy\u2019s debut album was released 3 ayers after the critically acclaimed \u201cHeartwork\u201d by Carcass and Michael Amott\u2019s consequential departure from the scouser band. He was probably responsible for the change of Carcass\u2019 original death/grind sound to the almost commercial edge of Necroticism; so you know what to expect here. \n\nThe extended version of the release includes two covers from Iron Maiden that confirm the melodic guitar leads\u2019 NWOBHM-origins thesis. The rest of the bonus material are live takes from a 1997 gig they did in Japan, the quality of this recordings is not very good but the crowd interaction is amazing. The original version however is just 32 minutes long, nicely structured as any \u201cproducer\u201d record from the music industry would be; no nonsense. My favorite tracks are \u201cEureka\u201d and \u201cCosmic Retribution\u201d because they are the heaviest but the whole album is very constant and an easy listen. I\u2019d recommend this to fans of NWOBHM, swede death metal or 1990-1993 Carcass.\n",
        "\nIf you ask me, (and everyone always does, of course), Arch Enemy's biggest problem is that they often show too much restraint with their music. They're more than capable of writing aggressive, ripping, ferocious songs when they want to, and when they get it right, it's some top quality melodeath. However, much of their catalog is made up of bland, mid-tempo tracks with the kind of \"everyone sing along\" choruses that can be a little cheesy at times. To Arch-Enemy's credit, it's this ability to write crowd pleasing songs like this that has made them one of the most popular melodeath bands in the world, but it can also be a downside when they stop themselves from writing the kind of vicious tracks that fans of more extreme metal might enjoy.\n\nLuckily, 2007's \"Rise Of The Tyrant\" is Arch Enemy when they're ferocious and out for blood. This record leans stylistically towards the thrashier, hard edged style that their earlier albums with Johan Liiva had delivered, with a few of the slower, anthemic tracks, because this is still Arch Enemy, after all. But luckily they keep the filler to a minimum. Opening track \"Blood On Your Hands\" kicks off with the Amott brothers' wild, jagged fretwork, before Angela Gossow comes in with a brutal shriek, and the song kicks off in earnest. Gossow's vocals are easily one of the highlights of the album, the passion and power behind them is undeniable. On the gloomy closer \"Vultures,\" her narration of someone coming face to face with her own mortality is one of her finest hours. \n\nAnd as I stated in the intro, the music is some of Arch Enemy's finest. The Amott brothers are in perfect sync, trading off razorblade riffs and fluid soloing, while the riffs flow into each other in excellent sequence, rarely feeling forced or shoehorned in. The melodic guitar leads are as omnipresent as ever, as in the choruses of \"The Last Enemy\" and \"In This Shallow Grave,\" both of which are terrific songs, leaning into the band's thrashier side, taking a few lessons from \"Slaughter Of The Soul.\" \n\nBut of course, the band just can't resist making their big singalong anthems. And to be fair, some of the time, it's actually pretty good. \"Revolution Begins\" was the song that seemed to be the most promoted from the album, and while the clean verses are pretty ho-hum, I admit that the chorus gets me going. \"The Day You Died\" is a choppy, melodic number that also takes a slower route, but it's done well, and has some of the finest guitar solos on the album. Unfortunately, \"I Will Live Again\" is where the album really dips in quality. It sounds like it was written hastily, and the riffs are just flat out uninteresting. And since Michael Amott can't resist jerking off all over the listener, the band included \"Intermezzo Liberte,\" a guitar instrumental that goes on too long for its own good.\n\nIn a nutshell, \"Rise Of The Tyrant\" is Arch Enemy when they actually sound inspired. It can be an inconsistent thing for them, like a student whose mother says that they \"just aren't applying themself.\" Well, for my money, this album is great example of what can happen when Michael Amott actually tries.\n",
        "\nThis album may be a surprising listen to those who are familiar with Arch Enemy from their 2000s era of commercial success. It is a much rawer and more 'brutal' ordeal, although still highly polished and clearly inspired by the emerging melodic death metal scene of sweden - as well as rather obviously Carcass, for whom Michael Amott played in their big \"sellout\" melodeath album Heartwork, full of his signature catchy riffage. Reinforced by his brother, they set out to establish themselves in this new scene. \n\nAs is usually the occasion with albums of this sort - the more brutal forms of melodic death metal that still have some death metal in them - the songs are split into \"death metal\" riffs that either bounce around in groovy power chords akin to old school swedish death metal, or tremelo riffage with a more consonant melodic edge, before climaxing into incredibly catchy lead phrases that somehow feel less goofy and melodramatic than their peers such as Dark Tranquillity and In Flames. The solos have a definite hard rock edge to them, you almost forget it's a pseudo death metal record.\n\nThe band was clearly not trying to create an obscure masterpiece, but a collection of highly catchy bangers. Each song has a memorable hook, for example the main lead in Bury Me An Angel that starts after the twisting death metal riff in the intro. The lead is extremely simple but effective, giving that melodic contrast to the death metal preceding it. Neither riff is complex but they work good together. \n\nMost songs follow traditional verse - chorus - verse - chorus - bridge into solo - chorus structure. There are 3 short intermission tracks, 2 of which are before and after track 7 Transmigration Macabre. I'm not sure why, they are not very remarkable and that track doesn't particularly stand out from the rest - it's roughly the same length and structure so I don't know why they did this. \n\nThe vocals are somewhat a standout part of the album - they aren't exactly growls, and aren't clean singing, but more of a deep shouting. They fit the production and the bands concept very well and make this album worth checking out if for no other reason. \n\nThe band went on to dumb down this fairly simple sound further and further as commercial success kept coming. While sad to see it is understandable - it pays the bills and they didn't exactly start out writing obscure music but catchy rock / heavy metal music with a more extreme aesthetic.\n",
        "\nI remember the first time I heard Johan Liiva's voice. I had gotten into a few Arch Enemy songs, some of the more well known ones from the Angela Gossow era. \"Ravenous,\" \"Dead Eyes See No Future,\" and the like. After seeing a live performance of \"Silverwing\" with Gossow on the mic, the song completely stunned me; it was beautiful and elegant while being crushing and heavy at the same time. I knew that Liiva had been the original vocalist, but not being familiar with most of their catalogue, I had never checked out any of his material. So I decide to listen to the original version of \"Silverwing,\" and man, I was impressed. Everything sounded just as great as that live recording had - except for one issue. The vocals. To me, Liiva just sounded sloppy and amateurish. He wasn't so much growling as much as he was just shouting in a low register. I was left wondering why so many fans seemed to prefer him to Gossow.\n\nBut the music itself was great, so I pressed on and checked out a few more songs. And as I did, Liiva's vocals grew on me fast. Sure, he may not have had Gossow's laser-guided vocal control or vicious shriek, but he sounds utterly *desperate* here. Desperate, yearning, like he's being torn apart by rage and indecision. At its core, \"Burning Bridges\" is a dark, gloomy album, moreso than a lot of melodic death metal albums. Judging from the lyrics, I'd venture a guess that Michael Amott had gone through some sort of messy breakup before writing these songs, but the stellar songwriting brings it above simple \"woe is me\" fare. And for 35 minutes, there's hardly a dull moment to be had.\n\nThe songwriting of the Amott brothers is brilliant here, covering a fairly diverse array of styles while still remaining under the melodeath umbrella. \"The Immortal\" and \"Dead Inside,\" the first two songs, take a thrash-influenced approach, but still have the sugary guitar style that the Amotts would make their signature. \"Seed Of Hate\" and \"Pilgrim\" have a classic heavy metal stomp, with plenty of aggression and impassioned vocals from Liiva to keep things extreme. I want to single out \"Pilgrim\" as possibly the greatest song on here, it's truly a masterpiece of songwriting and riffwork. By the time the last chorus hits, Liiva sounds absolutely demonic, filling the role of a tormented soul looking back on his life of piety and devotion with doubt and regret. \n\nElsewhere, they dabble in d-beat on the chunky \"Angelclaw,\" and the title track finale closes out the album on a somber note. It's a dark, torturous dirge, built around a few crushing riffs and a chilling violin outro. I honestly can't think of a better way to end it. It's this stylistic diversity that keeps the album interesting, instead of just playing at the same tempo for 8 songs. If I had to think of a shortcoming on this album, \"Demonic Science\" could have been a little shorter, maybe, but that's an extremely minor quibble compared to everything there is to love about the album.\n\nEven if you're someone who typically writes off melodeath as cheesy schlock, \"Burning Bridges might still be something you can love. If anything, it's more of an extreme heavy metal album, so give it a shot.\n",
        "\nInternational melodic death metal band Arch Enemy has recorded twenty-four cover songs so far in its career, more than most groups in their entire careers. Covered in Blood compiles all of them and features all eras and line-ups of the band, including their three different vocalists. Despite offering cover songs, the band manages to make these songs sound like their own with an energetic, harsh and raw twist. On the other side, the two dozen tracks of all eras also show that the band's formula and sound haven't changed very much. Faithful fans of the band will like what they hear while those who have never understood the group's immense popularity will still feel clueless after listening to this output.\n\nIn my opinion, the cover songs are hit and miss. The band's covers of crust and hardcore punk bands like Anti Cimex, Charged GBH and Shitlickers sound particularly great because the band has kept and accentuated the raw energy of the original tracks. It's a whole different thing for the group's more ambitious choices. Songs by Iron Maiden, Mike Oldfield and Queensr\u00ffche have a melodic, progressive and quite unique vibe that Arch Enemy's can't equal with its rough approach as said songs are barely recognizable and have lost all their charm.\n\nIt would have been great if the band had added a few brandnew songs but twenty-four tracks with a running time of more than seventy minutes still represent value for money. Listening to Covered in Blood is certainly entertaining because of its vivid diversity. However, there are pretty much as many great cover versions and there are missed attempts. The final result is better than I would have expected initially but it's still far from being essential.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the fairly criticized \"Khaos Legions\", an album that, while containing a few excellent songs, still stands as the band's weakest effort, Arch Enemy strike back with \"War Eternal\", an album that marks the beginning of a new era for these swedish melodeath metallers, due to the departure of long-time vocalist Angela Gossow (now taking the sceptre as the band manager) in favour of Alissa White-Gluz, former vocalist of melodic death metal/metalcore band \"The Agonist\". Now, you will be wondering, what innovations does the band bring on the table with this ninth full-length?\n\nThe answer is: none. At least, nothing really significative. Let me spend a moment talking about Arch Enemy's main issue: the lack of evolution in their musical style. Since the day they became a female-fronted metal act, they stuck to the exact same, commercially succesful formula that made them famous, and they never moved on. So here we go again, another Arch Enemy release, another display of the same, ultimately predictable kind of songwriting. Is \"War Eternal\" a bad album? No. Is it something we haven't already heard before? Absolutely no.\n\nNow, let's talk about the album. The production is awesome, balanced, it sounds fresh and modern, and one would expect nothing less from Century Media Records, especially considering that these guys are the label's battle horse. No need to dwell in discussions about the musician's skills: the drummer is technically proficient, Michael Amott's and Nick Cordle's virtuosity when it comes to shredding is out of discussion, the bassist just does his job. What about Alissa? Well, as much as I really loved Angela, mainly because of her passion and charisma (she was a good vocalist too, although not extraordinary or mindblowing), I have to admit that Alissa is just on a whole different level. She's amazing: her growls are so deep, threatening and powerful, her screams are out of this world, her diction while singing is perfect, and her voice offers much more means of expression compared to the previous singer. Really, one of the best extreme metal vocalists out there.\n\nLet's get to the music itself. Well, speaking of the guitar riffs department, I have to say Michael Amott got a bit lazy here: there's an overabundance in the use of the open low string (just think to the opening riff of the title track, consisting mainly in a palm muted alternate picking of the sixth string) and of power chords. Considering the memorable riffs he provided in albums like \"Wages of Sin\", \"Doomsday Machine\" or \"Rise of the Tyrant\", one would reasonably expect something more. The solos, on the other hand, are as mindblowingly technical and inspired as usual, and there are some nice guitar melodies and harmonies. The bass isn't relevant at all; the drumming is precise, featuring even blast beat sessions in certain songs. \n\nOne thing that I did notice was the fact that the band tried to give a slightly symphonic touch to the record: think to the orchestrations in \"Time Is Black\", the piano in \"On And On\", or the ominous orchestral intro to the album, named \"Tempore Nihil Sanat\" (which in latin means \"time heals nothing\"). They also added brief instrumentals, which serve as the album's introduction, mid-interlude, or closer, respectively. They aren't particularly relevant, musically speaking, but I'll give them credit for adding to the general atmosphere. Lyrically speaking, this release hasn't much to offer, same old lyrics about life struggles, pain, rebelling against society, taking revenge on those who betrayed you, and so on, although I have to say the lyrics of the tracks Alissa contributed to are considerably more interesting and accurately written.\n\nSpeaking of the songs, this album sure has its highlights. Opener \"Never Forgive, Never Forget\" kicks off the record with energy and raw aggression, thanks to the fast tempo, the blast beat sessions, and an excellent, violent vocal performance by Alissa; then we have \"War Eternal\", the first single extracted from the album, which slows a bit the pace while retaining a remarkable heaviness, also featuring some spectacular solos and an anthemic chorus; back to anger with \"As The Pages Burn\", noteworthy thanks to its guitar riff, the harmonies, and the memorable vocal lines, not to mention the catchy chorus. Other highlights include \"You Will Know My Name\", the balladesque and extremely melodic third single extracted from the album, and \"Avalanche\", which is distinguished by a contrast between the heaviness of the lines and the over-melodic chorus, featuring also some clean vocals by Alissa. The rest of the platter is generally good, although some songs may suffer from being a bit overlong or from sounding occasionally \"fillerish\".\n\nAll in all, Arch Enemy did it again: with minimum effort, they pulled out an album that resulted extremely succesful in terms of popularity, sales and mediatic attention (it reached nothing less than the 44th spot on the Billboard 200, the best result the band achieved in the US, selling a considerable amount of copies during the first week already). They pleased the fans (a lot of the songs they regularly perform live is extracted from this CD), they pleased most of the critics, the album sold well. Those who were expecting something new from the band, on the other hand, were disappointed, as almost nothing changed in their sound, and probably that's the reason why \"War Eternal\" gets all this hate. In my humble opinion, \"War Eternal\" was an honest effort, although far from being the band's best: it's still enjoyable and it does have its moments. Listen to it without expecting something stellar, and it won't displease you.\n",
        "\nAfter the success, but also the controversy, aroused by \"Doomsday Machine\", Arch Enemy, the often maligned, often praised swedish melodic death metal ensemble led by Amott brothers, comes up with its seventh full-length release, named \"Rise of the Tyrant\". Will this album uphold the band's growing reputation in the metal community, or will it just give rise to critics by detractors?\n\nWell, \"Rise of the Tyrant\" shows little progression from the band's previous outputs, since the entry into scene of vocalist Angela Gossow. The songs are heavy, the riffs are thrashy and extremely technical (think to album opener \"Blood On Your Hands\", if you want an example\"), there's plenty of awesome guitar shredding. Our blonde pet still growls and screams about rebelling against society, inner conflicts, pain, life struggles, etc.; the vocals are of course still overlayered, although less effected than in the band's previous album. The drumming is fast and aggressive, featuring some interesting patterns and fills; the bass is unfortunately lost in the mix. The production is well balanced (save for the aforementioned bass volume) and sounds fresh, managing to result modern while not sounding too polished or lifeless.\n\n\"Rise of the Tyrant\" is overall a really strong, enjoyable and solid effort; the only problem is, it's nothing we haven't heard before from the band. The main issue with Arch Enemy is that they stuck to the same, commercially successful formula since the arrival of Angela; although the band's discography remained consistent (at least, until this point), the feeling you might get after listening to this album more and more might be that of tiredness, fatigue. This doesn't mean the album isn't cool: simply, it's pretty much the same kind of stuff we've heard before.\n\nThe songs are overall strong, especially under the guitar department, featuring some top-notch riffing and some awesome guitar soloing, but they lack a bit of variety; they're almost all pretty much the same kind of track. The lyrical themes aren't particularly original or noteworthy, as stated above: they just fit the band's style. The guitar melodies, on the other hand, are definitely memorable and instantly recognizable, and they get fixed in the mind easily; this is an important requirement, since we're talking of a melodic death metal band. Furthermore, the choruses result particularly catchy and inspired.\nAlbum highlights include the aforementioned \"Blood On Your Hands\" (those riffs are really epic), leading single \"Revolution Begins\" (the melody and the chorus here are really noteworthy), the heavy title track \"Rise of the Tyrant\", and the final song \"Vultures\", the longest of the entire album.\n\nAll in all, we can easily say that, with this release, Arch Enemy delivered once again, crafting an album that, although not particularly original or innovative when compared to the band's previous outputs, still stands strong and results fun and enjoyable, thanks to its heaviness, the solid songwriting, the catchiness, the great production; too bad this CD would later be remembered as the last real quality release from the swedish melodeath giant, at least until now...\n",
        "\nOn this album, Arch Enemy finally realised what melodic 'death' metal is all about; speed metal riffs in a death metal-style enviroment. Riffs inspired by the 80's thrash metal bands, and maybe later Mot\u00f6rhead, are the main building blocks of this CD. On top of these riffs, the lead guitar rises with emotion in a style that has dominated all popular music the last few decades. The song structures do not wonder in to the progressive style of death metal, but rather stay in the standard verse-chorus style of heavy metal.\n\nThe anthemic vision that Arch Enemy have always strived for, seems to be present on this album more than ever. The album is surprisingly heavy and does not bow to the usual gimmicks of 'melodeath'. The guitarists lay down some memorable lead guitar lines over aggressive riffs, commented by the vocalists high screech. The songs build up with fairly standard, downtuned speed metal riffs, until the tension is relieved, usually in the chorus, with a lead guitar melody ranging from melancholic to rebellious. During verses the rhythm guitar sometimes steps away to a generic muted strum giving space for the vocalist's lyric delivery. Neo-classical licks in the style of Yngwie Malmsteen gives this album a dramatic undertone.\n\nAlthough the band's virtuosity comes across clear, I see no ego-boosting apart from a few solos, that could have been cut shorter. Explosive guitar solos are many and they follow the style of Iron Maiden with two separate spots for each guitarist to showcase their shred abilities. Nice dual harmonies also find their way to the end of these solo sections. Vocalist, while maybe too weak for death metal, does a nice job conveying these songs without being the center of attention. Bass is constantly present following the fast footwork of the drummer, who punctuates these riffs well.\n\nAll in all, this is an enjoyable record within a genre that has suffered from too many below-the-average acts. This hybrid of death and heavy metal is enjoyable in small doses and although it may not leave a lasting impression, it sure can make your feet stomp and head bang. The bar has been raised by Arch Enemy to heights that could cause other bands to move to other genres, which might be a good thing for the evolution of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nThis exclusive Japanese release features four songs that were previously released on vinyl for the limited edition of the Will to Power record. The record is sold for about five dollars and features four tracks with a total running time of about three and a half minutes. Arch Enemy were clearly in it for the fun and decided to cover four songs by Swedish hardcore punk band The Shitlickers.\n\nAs the band name, song titles and track lengths might suggest, the four tracks are straightforward hardcore punk that invites for violent dancing in concert. The riffs are distorted and fast, the bass guitar sounds like an angry bumblebee and the drums provide more noise than rhythm. The hoarse vocals make me think of a screaming pig and blend in perfectly with the instrumental work. The angry lyrics are short and concise.\n\nWhat I like about this release is its unpretentiousness. I'm not a big Arch Enemy fan but these violent four tracks are truly enjoyable while they last and made me discover a band I wouldn't ever have heard about. The short release with the cool cover artwork is a great exotic collector's items. To make things even more interesting, Canadian singer Alissa White-Gluz even sings in Swedish in one track. \n\nThis is the kind of album that you should crank up the volume to at four o'clock in the morning to piss off your neighbors. It doesn't have anything to do with metal but this is what makes this vivid release stand out. If you haven't purchased the limited edition of Will to Power and have a weakness for hardcore punk, this release is certainly worth five bucks.\n",
        "\nBy this point there's been so many reviews and different opinions written about this album that it seems almost pointless for me to add another, but I am going to do it anyway because of one simple fact:\n\n\"Rise of the Tyrant\" is what really got me into the Arch Enemy sound. Previously I have only heard a couple of their songs (those being \"Nemesis\" and \"Skeleton Dance\") and by the time I really started paying attention to the band, this album was released and I was eager to give it a listen.\n\nUnlike some of their other releases, there is no veil of secrecy and suspence implemented as an intro to the album. The band immediately bursts into \"Blood on Your Hands\" with strong intensity that is expected of them. The production on this album is much more raw than on \"Doomsday Machine\", the guitar sound is beastly and outright fucking dirty, and it suits the album very well. The drums could've been mixed with a bit more detail, but they are good enough despite the overwhelming amount of guitar shredding. Angela Gossow sounds as amazing as always and she is one of the reasons I really like this band (aside from the fact that she breaks stereotypes of growl vocals being almost exclusively a male thing).\n\nUnfortunately, this album does not come without flaws. The songs, while being very strong and impressive for the better part of the album, are not diverse enough to be immediately distinctive and I was not able to tell them apart from just the first couple of listens. \"I Will Live Again\" is, perhaps, one strong exception, and a song that despite being on the slower side than what I'm used to from Arch Enemy, is really good. I can't help but think that if Alissa White-Gluz was already in the band by this point, the song would've ended up even better with her clean vocals implemented, because Angela's performance here feels somewhat out of place during the verses. The leading solo just begs for a massive crowd chant, but instead it insists on harsh vocals and somewhat undermines the song's potential.\n\nBy the time the title track kicks in, I realize I wish there was at least some sort of a break from the pace of the album (despite this track being the one with an intro) and although \"Intermezzo Libert\u00e9\" provides it, I really really wish it was implemented a little bit earlier in the tracklist.\n\nOverall, while this album is not perfect, the good certainly outweighs the bad, and even some of the weaker songs on this release are still interesting and catchy enough to be - if not very memorable and a staple of Arch Enemy's work - very enjoyable still.\n\nPersonal favorites and highlights:\nBlood on Your Hands\nThe Last Enemy\nIn This Shallow Grave\nIntermezzo Libert\u00e9\n",
        "\nI was pretty hyped about \"Will to Power\" after the first single was released but I have to admit I had my doubts and for good reason. Arch Enemy haven't changed their songwriting style too much throughout the years so it was inevitable that they would eventually put out some disappointing material. And I guess that moment is here. This band has shown some impressive stuff throughout the years but this I'm afraid, is going downhill.\n\nI don't mean to say that it's a particulary bad album but it's not a good one either. And I think they really made a bad choice by releasing the best song on the album as a first single because it created some pretty high expectations and then hearing the full album was just not living up to them. There are some cool riffs and melodies that get your attention. And it gets you headbanging from time to time. But they don't really say anything with this music. In the past you could feel the anger, the rebellion and the passion put in those notes. But \"Will to Power\" just doesn't cut it anymore. It feels like they just released it because the label wanted it. They don't have anything to say. \n\nThere is one good asset to this album. The solos are very impressive, especially the ones written by Jeff Loomis, proving serious guitar playing skills. I find the leads in The Race quite enjoyable and impressive. \"The Eagle Flies Alone\", \"Blood in the Water\" and \"The World Is Yours\" are also some of the better songs on the album. I was also quite pleasantly surprised by the use of clean vocals on \"Reason to Believe\". The rest of the songs I'm afraid we're just put in there to fill up the time and get another album out. I don't find anything intersting or worth mentioning about them. They're empty.\n\nSo the album isn't entirely boring. There are some cool stuff every now and then and if you're a fan of a Arch Enemy you will probably enjoy it but to me it seems rather useless since it's pretty much the same as their past albums but lacking in passion and credibility. Maybe Michael Amott's creativity has been consumed.\n",
        "\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single self-respecting metalhead that hasn\u2019t at least heard of Arch Enemy. The melodic death metal band from Sweden has delivered quite some great songs that ended up becoming metal classics. Not too surprising considering the magnitude of the combined forces of the band members, you could almost call this a super group\u2026 They definitely set the bar in the genre and especially with an empowering and ever impressive Angela Gossow they have risen to the top and still are up there. This is the 3rd year that Alissa White-Gluz is fronting the band, growling her lungs out at the many always impressive shows of this touring machine. This year brings also the second release with her on vocals and the first for Jeff Loomis (ex-Nevermore) as second guitarist: 'Will To Power'. Being one of the most looked forward releases of the year, especially by their fans, we just had to give this a spin.\n\nAfter a short instrumental intro, we stumble in to 'The Race' and here we get what Arch Enemy are so well known and loved for. Blazing death metal guitars pushed forward by the pounding drums, poured over with a sauce of melody and hooks. Alissa proves from the first track on what a skilled vocalist she is and growls her way through the lyrics with a certain grit and ferocity. Their first single 'The World Is Yours' accomplishes much the same, for me personally it\u2019s the one track that sticks the most to my head for sure. It\u2019s heavy, but at the same time in the chorus they add a layer of more power metal feeling melody that just burns this song in my grey matter. Despite the rather cliche lyrics, the song carries a message of empowerment and positivism you wouldn\u2019t immediately expect from a band like this.\n\nAnd that brings us to what most likely will be the most talked about song of the album: 'Reason To Believe'. Mostly because of it featuring clean vocals by Alissa almost throughout. I have mixed feelings about this: the song actually sounds pretty good and the vocals damn powerful. That was sort of to be expected if you\u2019ve heard what Alissa has done before vocally for The Agonist and Kamelot. It\u2019s just really weird to hear a band that is so well-known for their sometimes heavier than heavy music come with what you could call a (power) ballad for them. I\u2019m curious to see what they might do with clean vocals in the future still. This was definitely a good little taste of what could be possible on this level.\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t a big fan of what just took place, it seems like they want to reassure you. 'Murder Scene' kicks in with a rumbling bass, being the interlude for the guitar shredding and drum beats taking you back to that classic Arch Enemy sound. The lyrics are also on a whole different level here, just like on the highly interesting and almost evil sounding down tempo 'First Day In Hell'. That would be one small piece of advice I\u2019d want to drop: maybe let Alissa write the lyrics for a few more songs than just half of them. Because no matter for all the musical talent and skills you possess, Michael Amott, writing lyrics isn\u2019t really your forte compared to what she produces.\n\nWhatever you want to say about Arch Enemy, one thing is sure: their music play is damn great and the vocals are as always top as well. There are just some songs that don\u2019t seem to stick, they don\u2019t get me totally excited. A bunch of the tracks are pretty great and will do well live for sure, just a pity that not the whole record puts down the same quality and memorability. 'Will To Power' will probably please a lot of metal fans still and I didn\u2019t feel like I wasted my time completely. But just like the occasional blockbuster I watch, I don\u2019t feel the need to go through it again completely any time soon. I\u2019ll pick out a few tracks and at least we know that live they\u2019ll keep on kicking ass and taking names\u2026 \n\noriginally published on www.grimmgent.com\n",
        "\nFrankly I had written off this album before it had even been released. War Eternal was poor - the worst that the band had ever done, in fact - and the two singles released before this album, 'The World Is Yours' and 'The Eagle Flies Alone' were of a similar standard. Though as a whole Will to Power is an inoffensive listen it certainly doesn't compare to Wages of Sin, Doomsday Machine or Rise of the Tyrant.\n\nObviously one of the main topics of debate is the vocals. I'm not a fan of Alissa's really, at least not when it comes to her harsh vocals. She sounds so flat and lifeless, with nowhere near the power or fury that her predecessor Angela Gossow possessed. She hasn't changed at all in her approach since War Eternal, yet somehow she grinds my gears more on this album than the last. Perhaps it's because she actually gets to show off her cleans here and there this time out, mostly on 'Reason to Believe'. That's where her talent lies, in actually singing rather than the boring cookie-cutter shite that for some reason Michael Amott seems reluctant to ditch, being the creature of habit that he is. If he thinks that the fans are going to throw a hissy fit and boycott his music because there are some cleans mixed in with the growls that make up 95% of the vocals he's sorely mistaken. I'd much rather that Alissa was given free reign to play to her strengths rather than being forced to potter along in second gear like Mike has been doing for the past ten years.\n\nWhile we're at it, let's mention Jeff Loomis. Even to those that haven't ventured far into his other material his name is instantly recognisable, and for good reason. The man has ideas and talents the like of which Arch Enemy has been lacking since Chris Amott called it quits. Don't get me wrong, I consider myself a fan of Michael Amott and in his prime the guy was incredible. But he's not exactly been setting the world alight with his songwriting of late, and it's been ten years now since Rise of the Tyrant, which was the last AE album to be received relatively positively. Yet he insists on writing everything himself so that the project retains that distinct Michael Amott sound. Since his brother Chris's departure prior to War Eternal this has become increasingly noticeable, and as the objectively more talented half of the duo perhaps he was the mastermind that was keeping Arch Enemy at least somewhat interesting. Had Loomis been given his opportunity to give some feedback and add a couple of new directions to the album then perhaps this album wouldn't have been as formulaic and predictable as it is. One can only hope that next time Mike is slightly more open to a little creative input from the rest of the band.\n\nI have to admit however that Will to Power is a step up from War Eternal. It's not fantastic, not even close, but the album is listenable and easy to digest from one end to the other. By and large the verses are fast, thrashy and aggressive, a hark back to some earlier (and better) Arch Enemy works. Honestly the riffs aren't anywhere near as bad as I'd anticipated, and even though there isn't much progression from the start of each song until the end I'm quite happy to have it there in the background while I'm doing something else. Some changes of pace or a little variety wouldn't go unnoticed, but as a whole it's fine. The verses particularly stand out as being consistently decent if not quite as furious and powerful as I'd like them to be. The choruses though tend to be where most of the songs go downhill. It's as if Mike just got halfway through each song and then decided it wasn't quite cheesy enough, so decided to throw in the most boring, cliche and downright cringey leads he could think up. The first single 'The World Is Yours' is probably the best example of this on the album (as well as showing off exactly how formulaic the writing has become), as the song starts off decently with some solid, thundering riffs that indicate something bigger is looming in the distance. Yet when it arrives I'd rather the band had just kept teasing us with the build up forever. The guitars move up an octave and the high-speed power riffing gets coated over by a lame-ass, feeble lead. There's no force to it, nothing to grab the listener's attention. If anything it would just prompt them to switch the song off. Really it's about the most generic power metal/melodeath lead that you could possibly come up with. Copy and paste the verse and chorus again, then chuck in a stale and predictable couple of solos, fade to Alissa whispering some bullshit about rebellion and finish by playing the chorus in a higher key. Rinse and repeat on every song on the entire album and voila, you have the next AE album. It's a shame in a way because the breakdown that follows the solos is actually fucking class, which I don't get to say very often regarding breakdowns. Strangely enough that's the kind of inspired moment I want to see more often, something unexpected that's executed far better than it ought to be.\n\nThere isn't much to say regarding the drumming or the bass. Sharlee is a solid enough bassist but for the most part his work goes unnoticed, buried beneath the guitars for all but a couple of minutes of the album's run-time. Give him a chance to show what he's got and he'll deliver, as he does in the brief sections where the rhythm guitar takes a break, but the rest of the time he might as well not even be there. In contrast to this Daniel's drumming is always there or thereabouts, rhythmically plodding away somewhere in the background. He's consistent and gets the job done, yet also incredibly unspectacular. In a way he too is coasting along, with nothing on Will to Power showcasing his true ability. It's been a while, sure, but this is the guy that used to play songs like 'Pilgrim', 'Machtkampf', 'I Am Legend' and 'Lament of a Mortal Soul'. When did the fills become so bland, the blast beats so slow and infrequent? Maybe you could blame Mike's writing and say it's constricting him or whatever, but I've come to expect more from his playing than what we're served up here.\n\nIf you couldn't be bothered reading those ramblings, allow me to summarise. I suppose across the board there is room for improvement. Alissa needs to be given more freedom to include passages of clean vocals, although at least Will to Power is a start in that respect. She isn't as good as Angela, but at least she isn't as godawful as Johan Liiva. Loomis needs to be included in the creative process or else there's no point in him being there at all. But most importantly, Michael (and to a lesser extent Daniel) needs to stop coasting and actually produce something that isn't by-the-numbers, cliche and tired melodeath. The individuals involved in this project are capable of so much more, but even on an LP that fails to deliver they do have some great moments. 'Murder Scene' is genuinely a satisfying listen, 'Dreams of Retribution' has flashes of the Daniel Erlandsson of old, Alissa's cleans throughout are implemented very successfully, the intro and chorus of 'A Fight I Must Win' are fantastic, and I even enjoyed the aforementioned breakdown on 'The World Is Yours'. If Michael wakes up and realises that we want him to challenge himself then I have no doubt Arch Enemy could produce another great album to add to their catalogue. Whether he will wake up is another matter however, and though I keep my fingers crossed I won't get my hopes up.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy's second single for \"Will to Power\" is in many ways similar to the first one. It carries the same atmosphere and message. It's supposed to be empowering. They mention things like \"swimming against the stream\" and \"falling to rise\". I think this is going to be the main theme of the album.\n\nThere are quite a lot of things I like about this song. The slow bits in the intro and outro create a powerful feel with a lot of personality. And the chorus is very catchy, which is actually quite representative for Arch Enemy. \n\nBut there are a few drawbacks. I'm really not impressed with the main riff. It's very simple and a bit uninspired I'd say. It does sound nice but somehow doesn't really work. I'd say the same thing about the lead parts. They don't really say anything. And this I think is the main problem with this song. They want to send a message but you don't really feel it in the music. And that's what I think is the most important thing. Music makes you feel certain things that you can't just say. Here I'm afraid the message is only in the lyrics. And those are a bit lacking in power as well. So \"The Eagle Flies Alone\" is a good song but it lacks in credibility.\n\nAnd obviously, most people would feel compelled to compare it with \"The World Is Yours\". And that first single is really the same thing, only it's \"more\". To sum it up, by listening to this song you can tell what they were aiming for but they didn't quite cut it. It's good as a second single but I'm expecting more from the album.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy recently released their new single \"The World Is Yours\". Since War Eternal there was a lot of touring and activity in the band and just when I was thinking that it's time for some new music, news of the album \"Will to Power\" and this single came along.\n\nThe new song has got a lot of power and impacts the listener from the first audition. The main riff is really heavy and the drums are seriously fast. And the chorus is very catchy and will certainly stay in your head. After the two verses and the chorus there's a really good breakdown too. That's serious headbanging material. The solos are also quite good. The first one strikes you out of nowhere and goes really fast while the second one is more melodic and comes just before the end of the song. \n\nIn terms of songwriting then, it's quite typical for Arch Enemy. But there's a twist. This song creates a very optimistic mood. And the lyrics are quite motivational too. It would seem that Arch Enemy are experimenting a different direction for their music. The whispered part is also a new thing. With piano on the background, it really doesn't sound like what this band would normally do. They've always been full of rage and inspired rebellion and anarchy. So this idea doesn't fit the pattern at all. Alissa's growls bring a lot of power and charisma to the whole thing but in the context, they also seem positive and motivational. \n\nI like how the same Arch Enemy style of music brings a different perspective and a whole new idea. This single got me really hyped about the new album and I'm more than curious to see what they've got in store for \"Will to Power\"\n",
        "\nOops! What's happening here? Did Arch Enemy get drunk and then decided to write a song? It feels like they did their usual type of song and then sprinkled some whipped cream on top. This song sounds like what you would expect from Arch Enemy, except for the fact that it is unexpectedly bright. What the hell were they thinking? This is definitely something to raise controversy among the fans. \n\nArch Enemy has always been revolutionary and vengeful. Their music spoke of anarchy and rebellion against society. While listening to it, you could see an angry mob, tearing through the streets of a city, burning and plundering whatever they could. The new song doesn't stick to the pattern that well. The lyrics still refer to the old ideas. It says that justice will be done, and seems to speak about a personal evasion from a society pattern. But the whole thing focuses on the outcome of a rebellion, the freedom that one individual would receive, rather than the actual plunder. You could say that it is the same idea, but it skips some of the rage and anger. Especially in the chorus the whole thing sounds surprisingly optimistic. The main guitar theme in the chorus speaks loudest in this direction. \n\nArch Enemy have recently changed their lead vocalist. The arrival of Alissa White-Gluz disappointed some fans while pleasantly surprising others. I only know the band for a year so I am not in any of those categories. But I can tell that Alissa will be blamed for many of the changes. Many people say that she ruined the band, while others say that she is a positive influence. I believe that the changes are just the natural course of the band. Michael Amott even says in an interview that he just decided to do whatever the hell he wanted on this album. The songwriting is shifting simply because Michael Amott wanted to do it. \n\nFrom my point of view, the bigger change in the band is Jeff Loomis. The new guitarist sticks to his style of soloing from his work despite being in a completely different context. His soloing on this song is like a sudden shift in the atmosphere before returning to the previous idea. Besides being very different from the band's style, Jeff Loomis is just too good for Arch Enemy. \n\nThe music brings more surprises as well. At the middle of a song there is a heavy bridge that reminds of the old Arch Enemy, and it is weirdly followed by a synth reprise of the chorus idea with the lyrics being whispered. \n\nSo here is how I see things. There have been changes in the line-up, and the new members have brought their own superpower, whether it's growls or shredding. But this sudden change of perspective is what they wanted to do. And I respect a band that follows its own intentions, and doesn't aim to please the fans, who want the same recipe. This song is awesome, and you should give it a go. If the whole new album that this single is extracted from will approach this perspective, I believe it will be a blast.\n",
        "\nI've been following Arch Enemy for some years already, and to be honest, their music is mediocre, and it has been decreasing in quality over the years, eventually becoming pretty generic and boring, and this song is a good example of that.\n\nSo, the song is titled \"The World is Yours\" (it sounds like a self-help message), and the lyrics seems to be a critic to the capitalism (I guess?), they talk about an \"empire\", which you can destroy to get the world, very lame lyrics to be honest.\n\nThe guitars are in C tuning and the song in the key of Cm (I think). in and starts with some generic tremolo which is interrupted by a \"scream\" using the whammy bar, which leads to a riff similar to any other Arch Enemy riff ever, then Alissa's vocals come in, which are average gutturals with higher pitch. The same riff as before plays during the verse (with some variations), the riff goes for one measure and then power chords come in, and everything repeat for the whole verse. After the verse we get the chorus, which is very bad in my opinion. It consists of a simplistic and a bit melodic lead riff, while the rhythm guitar plays a boring progression using tremolo picking and Alissa sings with a total lack of motivation. Looks like they tried to make an epic chorus but they only made something that almost sounds like pop music. After the chorus we get a short solo which is just some shredding with no actual objective, and then everything repeats. After the second chorus, we get a bridge which is the most interesting part of the song, the lead guitar plays a melody that sounds dark and a bit chaotic, we get some vocals and then a boring dual lead solo that lacks of any feeling or harmony. After that we jump to a metalcore-ish breakdown with a lead riff on the background. Then we get again the verse riff, and instead of directly going to the chorus, everything goes quiet and Alissa whispers the lyrics of the chorus while a piano plays the lead riff, after two measures the other instruments join in and play quietly, and then we get the normal chorus once again, and yet another senseless solo just to show that Michael Amott can play the guitar. Finally, the song ends with the lead riff being played by various instruments. The bass and the drums are buried by the guitar and the vocals for the whole song; the bass is only audible during the dual lead solo, and looks like the bassist plays a rhythm pattern, and the drums are just there, the drummer just plays common melodeath drumming with some blasts, nothing new.\n\nSummary: \"The World is Yours\" is a generic melodeath song with lame riffs, boring chord progressions, uninteresting drumming, and average guttural vocals, which lacks of any originality, motivation, melody or effort, is what you would hear from any band of this genre, and it just shows how bad Arch Enemy has become after more than 20 years of playing music without ever changing their sound, always recycling old ideas.\n",
        "\nI'll admit that my taste has changed quite a bit. A few years ago, I was in a melodic death phase. Nowadays, I almost listen exclusively to technical/brutal death metal and some of the harder thrash when it comes to metal. So beyond knowing that she's been in one album, I've been seriously out of the loop, and this is the only song that I've been able to listen to enough to make an opinion.\n\nMy biggest problem is Alissa's wasted potential; I acknowledge that Arch Enemy are completely different monster than The Agonist, so harsh vocals being in full force were to be expected, but it still feels like something is missing, as her biggest strength was her singing. I don't consider myself an expert when it comes to singing from a technical standpoint, but her voice was nice to hear at the least, and for me, they complement her harsh vocals. They're average at best on this song, to be honest. Not because she's an incompetent screamer, (she's actually quite skilled), but because she's capable of so much more. The closest we get is some spoken (whispered?) word around the three minute mark in a surprisingly soft part.\n\nAs for the other guys? I didn't care too much for Nevermore, but weren't Jeff's riffs there a lot more complex and heavy there? I recall hearing a few Nevermore songs and the only reasons I didn't get hooked on to them was because I wasn't a fan of Warrel Dane, but I do recall being impressed by Jeff's riffs. The intro riff is pretty damn good, but it sadly falls off when it finally passes by. At least his guitar solos are nice, being super complex, yet remains melodic enough to capture your interest. Michael Amott isn't too shabby here either, his solo I believe coming around the end of the song being the less complex, but being the more melodic. \n\nI don't have much to say in regards to the bass and drums, as from the few other songs I've heard from Arch Enemy, they've always been more vocals/guitar focused than anything else. Both the drummer and bassist are good enough, being competent and full of energy to keep this song going, but nothing new is really done here as I don't think they're doing anything different otherwise.\n\nIf you liked Alissa's harsh vocals a lot more than me and don't mind the lack of clean vocals, you may enjoy this. If you're like me and haven't exactly given their previous album enough listens, you won't be missing out.\n",
        "\nI unfortunately have been very late to the party as far as the pre-Gossow era Arch Enemy is concerned. Thankfully within the last year and a half I have been able to remedy that situation with haste and while I still can\u2019t really pick an overall favourite among the amazing trifecta of Black Earth, Stigmata and Burning Bridges, this vicious slab of extremity is definitely the band at their heaviest and most creative to boot. The two other albums feature a different approach and style as far as brutality and songwriting is concerned that I also dig, but in my opinion this is the one to beat. I don\u2019t know if a lot of you would be aware of this, but it has a lot of cross appeal to many different kinds of metal fans, especially fans of 80s heavy metal and thrash. Hell even the hardiest die-hard fans of old school death metal could definitely like parts of this album if they just gave it a shot. There\u2019s definitely something for everyone here.\n\nAs all of you have heard a thousand times before, these guys along with Dark Tranquillity, At The Gates and In Flames were pretty much the pioneers of melodeath back in the mid-90s. Soilwork as well, but they arrived on the scene a few years later. The first song off the album \u201cBeast Of Man\u201d should be enough to tell you that this band were a hell of a lot more technical than their peers plus their vicious intensity was matchless back in the day. Think the perfect melding of Human / ITP era Death, (yeah I know I\u2019ve been saying that a lot in my recent reviews) the flowing catchy melodies of Iron Maiden and the brutality of the early classic Swedeath bands namely Entombed and Dismember. I honestly think the slight technical death metal influence (of the old guard, of course) gave Arch Enemy an overall edge over other bands in the genre. The solo sections are aplenty of course, but this album merges both the lead and pummeling rhythm sections in a way that was rarely seen back in the day. Lastly everyone pretty much knows that the Amott bros virtuosity was unmatched and no more is it more evident than on this album. That too on every fucking song. Just trust me on that one. \"Arch Enemy\" is a beautiful emotive piano interlude with amazing leads that acts as a breather from the relentlessness of the previous 7 songs. There are even a few clean picking sections on songs like \"Let The Killing Begin\" and the like. Also surprisingly a boatload of later-era (to be more precise, the Gossow era) Arch enemy riffs are also found on this album. Not in an out-and-out plagiarizing sense, but they are definitely similar, so I really don't get how there are still some fans out there arguing that the music of the current avatar of the band is actually better than the music on this album. \n\nNow Johan Liiva\u2019s vocals being more of a hardcore bark/shout with a very slight undercurrent of growls to them seem to be a bone of contention for some and while I can understand that some die-hard melodeath fans would have a bit of a problem, the overall music is just so good that I couldn\u2019t care less. In any case his vocals don\u2019t come in the way or anything or is there anything wrong with them at all in that sense, just a tad weak in delivery plus you do kind of crave for a bit of variety in them, like a bit more high pitched screams to accentuate his vocals. Anyway that\u2019s too small a complaint to even be bothered about. \"Black Earth\" is one hell of a scorcher and the best song on the album for obvious reasons with a killer bellowing chorus of \"BLACK!! EARTH!! SAVE! OUR! SOULS!\" and a hyper headbanging riff backing it. After an atmospheric intro, \"Tears Of The Dead\" kicks in with one of the best riff progressions of the entire album at 0: 15 that is bound to get your neck snapping in no time. \"Bridge Of Destiny\" is another winner and the outro progression that starts at 5:32 is just out of this world. Goddamn this is sick. Even though it probably won't happen, I would honestly kill to see the band perform any of these songs live. \n\nAlthough I would still give the edge to Wages Of Sin for being the best all-round album, this one isn't that far behind at all. In fact, if it weren't for the slightly lackluster vocals and thin production this doozie would've gotten a straight 100 for sure and at the end of the day, it's right up their with the aforementioned album as one of their best. Like I already said, there's something for every metalhead out here.\n",
        "\nHere's the deal guys: as far as consistency is concerned (a problem with their later Gossow era albums), this album along with Stigmata and Burning Bridges is them at their peak exploding with intensity, integrity and innovation. This was the golden age of melodeath fellas, and rest assured these guys played their part in bringing the genre to its creative height along with Soilwork, Carcass, Edge Of Sanity, Dark Tranquillity and (old!) In Flames. \n\nLet\u2019s face it, with Arch Enemy it\u2019s always been about the guitars and the Amott brothers kill it as usual unleashing a storm of riffs and wild shredding kicking your ass all the way back to hell where it truly belongs. I mean of course I have my particular favourites from the album, but every single song stand out and slays from beginning to end, no exceptions. The first song I heard was \"Enemy Within\" entranced by the beautiful piano intro and by the next hour, I found myself humming the verse riff kicking off around 1: 25. Try getting that one out of your heard, I dare you. \n\n\"Burning Angel\" also opens with some awesome leads scorching the riffs on top carrying the intensity to the very top. Both \"Ravenous\" and \"Heart Of Darkness\" have some of the most mosh-worthy opening riffs, guaranteed to ensure permanent neck and spine trauma afterwards. The beautiful melodic section at 2:33 on \"Ravenous\" is to die for and the guitar licks in \"The First Deadly Sin\" and \u201cSavage Messiah\u201d are too damn addictive to ignore. \"Web Of Lies\" is one vicious chugathon slowly ripping your flesh off piece by piece. And \u201cSnow Bound\u201d is truly a beautiful evocative instrumental. Any brain-dead twat who claims the Amotts just mindlessly shred without feel, point him to this song! And if that still doesn\u2019t convince him, he\u2019s probably dead inside so you can tell him to continue listening to his rap/hip hop crap. \n\nThe only time the band probably slow down is the intro of \"Savage Messiah\" finally exploding into the main verse riff at around the 1 minute mark making way for an even more phenomenal set of riffs finally leading into the earth-shattering chorus where you will get down on your knees howling \"Savage!! Messiah!! Take us!! higher!! Savage!! Messiah!! Take us!! Now!!\". Trust me the song does have that effect, believe it or not. This is definitely my personal favourite song from the album, using a dark and brooding atmosphere to great effect. \n\nAll in all one of my first melodic death metal albums and it has yet to lose its lustre or charm. I mean every fucking song hits you like a ten ton hammer and forces you to mosh you goddamn brains out while the melodies stick to your brain like superglue. Just what melodeath was meant to do in the first place. Not the scene today, with bands tainting the sound with alternative and pop metal influences (cough*In Flames*cough). Nothing much more to say folks. A true classic of melodic death metal, period. Oh and the solos rule. But hey you knew that already. \n\nStandout tracks: All of them! But okay, particularly - Enemy Within, Heart Of Darkness, Savage Messiah, The First Deadly Sin and Dead Bury Their Dead.\n",
        "\nLet's not beat about the bush, this album frustrates me. As with the following year's 'Burning Bridges', the album jumps out of the gate with its best and most energetic track, then proceeds to wallow in mediocrity at later stages. My question is this: if Arch Enemy were capable of writing 'Beast of Man', couldn't they have written something else approaching similar levels of brilliance, or at least made sure that the other songs were free of tedious moments? My major gripe with the album is thus its varied quality and also the regular dips in intensity that are caused due to the longer songs seen on 'Stigmata'.\n\nWe are in the precincts of melodic death metal with Arch Enemy, though I believe that this band sounds little like In Flames or Dark Tranquillity, nor much like At the Gates. During some of the heavier sections, they play uncompromised death metal parts that barely differ from the tradition of that genre, while their leads always blend virtuosity and melody together, instead of concentrating on the folky exuberance of In Flames's signature sound. There are also many catchier riffs that sound modern in the same way that 'Slaughter of the Soul' sounded modern, prefiguring some of the metalcore bands who later emerged, though often using a more subtle, integrated approach to the chug-and-fill style. With Arch Enemy, there has always been a tendency to slow down as well, which we can witness on the gruelling death doom of 'Dark of the Sun'. This suits the band well in the crushing chorus, as well as for the licks thrown into the pre-chorus, but the chugging verse is plain and dry, while the whole song drags itself out to 7 minutes, making those disappointing parts glaringly obvious.\n\nThat slower, plainer style is what bugs 'Stigmata', since 'Let the Killing Begin' is a prime example of a track that has been forgotten (or should be forgotten), with that horrible nothing-y groove riff that lasts for ever and makes no impression. 'Black Earth' redeems itself by having more energy than 'Let the Killing Begin', but has the most horrible slow chords thrown in the middle of verses for no apparent reason, utterly breaking the momentum and atmosphere that the faster parts have begun building. The other songs generally fare better, with even the short introductions containing decent melodic material, though little of lasting interest. Aside from the strong statement of 'Beast of Man', 'Tears of the Dead' is great, getting a strong marching groove into the verse and a chorus that really kicks up the intensity.\n\nAll of the musicians are performing similar roles to those that they would later play on 'Burning Bridges', with the only grumble being the production, which holds the guitars back at times and makes the sound broader and sludgier than the melodic material requires. Bass is there or thereabouts, though isn't helpful at giving more definition to the sounds, in fact adding to the low-pitched and sludgy affair. Johan Liiva has been accused of ineptitude on vocals, yet his visceral, rather unskilled attack suits the style and doesn't particularly hold the band back. What Arch Enemy lack here is not the chops but instead the planning that would have made this album so much stronger: cutting weak riffs, attending to overlong structures, and bolstering the production could change this from a decent outing with several flaws into a really impressive and interesting melodeath release. This doesn't hurt nearly so much, nor has so precise an end point in view, as the needled blue guy on the cover.\n",
        "\nThe important thing with opening tracks sometimes is that they rip your head off and spit down the hole, leaving the listener reeling in the wake of the assault and unable to recover for the duration of the album. That sort of happens here, whereby 'The Immortal' is so completely and utterly destructive that picking holes in songs like 'Demonic Science' or 'Seeds of Hate' becomes easy in comparison, as well as rather mean. I think the cover image is absolutely perfect for this album, since it's probably a selfie of someone after listening to that first track, with their ragged bloody stump still in the position their arm was when they pressed the play button. Anyway, enough buffoonery: is 'Burning Bridges' really good enough to cause such personal injury? \n\nYes and no, to be honest. For me, it's always difficult to consider Arch Enemy as a chronological beast, since I heard the Angela Gossow-era material before any of the Johan Liiva albums and prefer the early work so strongly that this seems to weigh in at about 100% when stacked up alongside 'Doomsday Machine' and 'Anthems of Rebellion', which relied too much on groove and production rather than song quality, speed, and riffs. One thing that has always puzzled me about the Amott brothers is that they are both very, very talented but don't seem able to compose and structure songs efficiently. Looking at the later material, the slower pace and plainer riffs are baffling; why would you downplay your best element? On the other hand, 'Stigmata' also had some slow sections, though the problem with that album was its messy nature - the songs seemed to have a lot of rough edges and not fit together fully. 'Burning Bridges' is not quite \"song-writing for dummies\" though it favours a much simpler technique. The general approach to any given song is as follows: 1. Take a riff and play it a few times, perhaps with one change. 2. Take another riff and use it to lead into the verse. 3. Take a third riff and get Liiva to shout something over it. 4. Play one of the first riffs again. 5. Chorus. 6. Repeat steps 1-5. 7. Do solos for a minute. 8. Chorus. Really, it's quite simple, uses a fair number of riffs, and doesn't give many opportunities to fuck things up.\n\nThe fact that this formula works so well is proof of the band's abilities. Anyone who's spent more than a year or two listening to metal must have come across at least one of the instrumentalists on this album, while anyone more experienced should understand that 'Burning Bridges' is the kind of release on which these musicians built their reputations. Daniel Erlandsson, in the first place, is practically ubiquitous in the melodeath and extreme metal scene in Europe, with stints in so many bands it's actually become difficult to keep track. His style here is not exactly typical of melodeath as a genre, but typical of Arch Enemy as a band, including so much variation and such a high level of precision that even some of the rhythm riffs sound like they are written by the drummer rather than by the guitarists. Perhaps his defining characteristic is a lightness of touch and relentless energy that might seem at odds with each other, but keep the album pacy and upbeat. Sharlee D'Angelo has been around as well, though doesn't get quite such a strong outing, often being hidden by guitars, except for some small features in 'Seed of Hate' and 'Angelclaw'. The guitarists are arguably at their creative and performative best on this album: there are a whole slew of amazing riffs and a lot of lead material (perhaps 10 minutes of this 35 minute album contains lead guitar), which maintains an incredibly high quality in general, despite a few mindlessly chuggy and over-rhythmic sections. The catchiness is another important factor that they provide, since Liiva doesn't have the voice to produce hooks, although he is consistently brutal and sometimes emotional, which grounds the album, allowing the guitarists to add melody. The production benefits all of these elements and fortunately doesn't sound too clean, helping Liiva with his slightly rough voice and ensuring that quality is paramount, while groove isn't really an issue.\n\nNow, I need to justify that comment about 'The Immortal'. That song gets my nod as the best here simply because it displays such a phenomenal amount of energy and drive and has the most memorable riffs of the album. The first one is not bad, the second is raging, and the chorus riff might never leave your head again, while the solos certainly don't disappoint - it's that kind of song. The other numbers are all a little slower and some, like 'Dead Inside' and 'Demonic Science' have a couple of naff parts, but the quality is generally very strong. The album benefits from having only 8 songs, since they are slightly similar and might get boring after 45 minutes, but the virtuosity accounts for a bit of the variety and we are never too far from something memorable. 'Pilgrim' and 'Silverwing' edge it as the catchiest and most distinctive of the mid-paced songs, while the closing title track changes things up for an epic doomy crawl, complete with orchestral sounds that leave the album with a lamenting, hollow feeling far from the exuberant melodeath of the first half hour and entirely befitting of that statue on the cover. Some editions also include 'Diva Satanica' and 'Hydra', which are decent additions, the former being a fast-paced song with some hooky riffage and the latter a short creepy instrumental.\n\nI'm not completely sure if there is any Arch Enemy album that I can give myself over to loving entirely, but 'Burning Bridges' comes as close as possible to perfection in this style and with these songwriters. Nothing is bad, most of it is great, and everything has plenty of replay value. Just adjust the volume setting before 'The Immortal' - up or down, your choice.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy is probably the most famous band which features a female growler - that used to be famous Angela Gossow who's now been replaced by Alissa White-Gluz. They became widely known with Gossow in the front of the band. Musically, however, they slowly started to stagnate during that era. Arch Enemy actually started off with Johan Liiva as the vocalist and Amott brothers being out of the planet guitar duo. Michael Amott was also involved with English extreme metallers Carcass, from where he brought over many ideas to kickstart Arch Enemy. The first couple records had more of the Carcass tunes in there, on this one they achieved more original sound.\n\nThere is a debate going on among the fans about which vocalist was better - Johan or Angela. Angela's voice is certainly powerful, but she tended to frequently overdo the vocals. Liiva on the other had nowhere near as deep a death metal growl, but was a very emotional vocalist during his tenure with Arch Enemy. While he was somewhat disappointing on \"Stigmata\", then this was easily his best effort. It also tops AE's debut. It's all about the heart he put in. His voice floats above the amazing riffing, rather than cutting through it - and it is fairly melodic as well. Presumably, most of the people who have found out about the band started their journey with some release featuring Gossow, and therefor Liiva's vocals may sound strange at first, but actually they fit in the music really well. It does take some time though, because the transition is pretty big.\n\nLiiva is good, but the show is stolen by the already mentioned Amott brothers. The effort they've put into that record is simply amazing. This album is a little bit more melodic than the two predecessors, but \"Burning Bridges\" made AE really sound like one of a kind. While it is very melodic, there are a lot of thrashy riffing to be found also. In fact, main riffs are derived from thrash, but they also feature melodic trickery and super catchy hooks. And yet the guitar duo manages to be aggressive all the time, even when it comes to incredible dual leads. The seemingly never ending juicy riffing is backed up with some class act drumming that's precise and interesting all the time and adds heaviness to some more melodic parts. \n\nWhile the word \"melodic\" has been used a lot in this review, this album remains rather gloomy for the most part thanks to aggressive rhythm sections and Liiva's vocal delivery. Still, melodic riffing gives the album a little more lighthearted feel at times... for some tastes maybe even too much at times. One song they kill atmosphere by overdoing it a little is \"Angelclaw\", where last solo sounds too \"happy\". To counter that, the last song \"Burning Bridges\" has the darkest atmosphere of all the songs off this album, and even delivers doom metal feeling. The slow and sinister chugging this track features may not be the real highlight of this album, but is a surprise and a nice final accord to the album.\n\n\"Burning Bridges\" is THE Arch Enemy album. The first two and some of the later albums by the band are brilliant also. From Angela's era \"Wages of Sin\" and \"Doomsday Machine\" nearly always do it for me. Sadly, the riffing has lost its magic and become less exciting over time. Arch Enemy can be accused of taking too safe road on many albums, but that's not the case of their early releases. It is an insane Gothenburg styled riff fest - a must for every melodeath fan and even more so, for every Arch Enemy fan. And definitely a fine album to get started with melodic death metal.\n\n94/100\n",
        "\nI knew 2 things about Arch Enemy by the time I got my teeth into this album. 1. They played death metal (I was more than a little ignorant of the distinction between death and melodeath back then), which was clearly too heavy for a kid like me. 2. Their singer was a fucking terrifying German woman who sort of impressed me in a weird sexy/not sexy see-saw. With the years, I've grown used to Arch Enemy, and that extreme heaviness that I initially identified with the band has been replaced by other feelings. I do remember thinking that, on first listen, Doomsday Machine was not nearly as much of a challenge as I had thought it would be (not nearly so difficult as Celtic Frost's 'Morbid Tales' that I bought alongside it) and feeling a little underwhelmed by the whole phenomenon.\n\nNowadays, my death metal virginity in tatters, I would place Arch Enemy at the heavier end of melodeath, but I would also label them as one of the catchier and more dynamic of the Swedish brethren. These guys have never been afraid of slowing things down, nor have they ruled out the potential advantages of sounding groovy alongside their meanness. Perhaps the least thrash influenced of the '90s crew, Arch Enemy truly brought their pace down a step and injected a modern \"crushing\" sound on Doomsday Machine. There's an image on the back cover of a skull being squashed by the pressure of heavy machinery that perhaps represents the band's intention with this new style of death. In some places, like the sinister chug and crawl of 'My Apocalypse' or the thuggish down-tuned chorus of 'Carry the Cross', this is exactly what the band achieve, but I would argue that their embracing of this brutal aesthetic isn't complete enough to mask the lack of genuine speed and aggression on the album.\n\nFor starters, there are only 2 songs that are particularly fast - the melodic thrash workout of 'I Am Legend/Out for Blood' and the absolute shred-fest that is 'Nemesis'. Neither of those songs are fast for their whole length either, because there is the atmospheric breakdown and melodic solo of the former, plus the annoyingly lacklustre chorus of the latter that spoils the perfection of an amazingly tight and furious song. I guess, having tuned the guitars down to C, the Amott brothers reckoned they had better make use of the earth-shaking power of their instruments and to be fair they do have a great rhythm tone, but slow melodeath is like odour-free cheese - who the fuck is satisfied with that? Besides, sometimes the riffs crush and sometimes they just become tedious, without enough excitement to propel the songs forward. For 2 guys with the chops the Amotts possess, you might have expected them to come up with something better than \"let's rely on a really heavy tone\". Maybe medium-pace would be more successful if Angela Gossow was able to inject some edginess into her vocals, which she quite simply isn't capable of. Having long got over the stage of \"So it's a lady?\" I've come to realise that Gossow has exactly the opposite problem to her predecessor Johan Liiva: whereas he had very little natural talent and a poor technique, Gossow sounds extremely proficient yet puts almost nothing into her performance but technique, leaving her contribution largely uninteresting, especially considering that she has an even greater lack of urgency than the band. Also, the lyrics are super dull on Doomsday Machine.\n\nOur friend Daniel Erlandsson on drums is trying to keep things lively, but he doesn't have an awful lot to work with and in fact makes a few bad choices, playing too precisely with the stuttering guitars and being unable to make much individual impression because of the dominance of the guitarists. Sharlee D'Angelo is often a rather quiet figure in Arch Enemy, and here, because the guitars are tuned low, his impact is also lessened, though when we do hear him he plays in a remarkably catchy style that gives the album some of its groovy flavour. The only point where the album really triumphs is in its catchiness and with the frequent solos that the Amotts introduce with such flair and care. This makes a song like 'Machtkampf' one of the highlights, since it fires off several short solos at key moments, has a simple chorus melody (we're not exactly talking 'Silverwing' here) that hooks it into the listener's memory, and includes a key change that any idiot could have thought of yet is precisely what is required.\n\nI'm going to agree with a previous reviewer and say that the band have overthought and underthought various parts of this album, resulting in the release sounding great physically, but ending up short on quality songwriting and hooks. Sure, a few songs slay for much of their runtime, my preference going to 'Nemesis', 'My Apocalypse', and 'Machtkampf', while others stand as decent or slightly better. However, certain decisions seem glaringly awkward: Angela Gossow, whatever her reputation, does not have the voice to support clean guitars in the verses of 'Carry the Cross', nor do the band have enough common sense to make use of some great individual musicians and the combined sound they can create. Maybe that's why Doomsday Machine includes 2 instrumentals - the band just couldn't find a balance between their respective gifts.\n",
        "\nI've reviewed everything else by the band, so I think that I should complete the collection and add Black Earth and Burning Bridges to my list of Arch Enemy reviews. Johan Liiva certainly puts me off, but I think I can withstand his vocal 'talents' for two records. Anyway, this is the one that started it all. Black Earth, supposedly one of the classic melodic death metal albums from the '90s. This is back before melodeath was the cool thing to play, before everyone hopped on that bandwagon and made it accessible to the casual fan. Yes, this is the good stuff, the real stuff.\n\nUnless you're someone like me. Someone with a taste for the modern stuff that gets slagged by half of the metal community. Someone sits on the side of the fence belonging to those that love the genre. Basically, I don't believe everything about this record being one of the most epic records ever released. The 2009 release The Root of All Evil where many older songs were rerecorded could probably outshine this record by a long way. The playing is cleaner, more precise, just generally better. Plus on that record you don't have to put up with the abysmal vocals offered by Mr Liiva.\n\nThere are worse singers in the world than Johan. Really, there are. I don't believe him to be the worst that has ever existed or will ever exist, because quite clearly that'd be wrong (anyone using pig squeals is worse, for example). But at the same time I really can't see what so many others seem to find in his voice. He just always sounds so bored and out of place, and he never sounds as if he's giving any effort at all. He just kills the mood that the guitars create as well, counteracts every bit of spectacular work that the Amott and Amott duo play. What anyone ever liked about his performances is simply unfathomable to me.\n\nThe aforementioned Amott brothers are as solid as they usually are. Obviously this was their first attempt at an album together and they play very well off of each other, always challenging one to strike a further blow against the other. What needs to be cleared up though is that the music is more death metal with melodic influences than melodic with death metal influences. It's a change in style from their modern-day works, but it's still good to listen to. It isn't as clean as I'd perhaps want it to be, but that's part of the effect that this album creates. It's meant to be dark, not the lighter stuff that they do nowadays.\n\nDrumming is by Daniel Erlandsson just like with the AE that are still around in 2014, and he's just as good on his debut than he's proven to be ever since. He keeps a nice rhythm going in the background and for the entire album proves that he can indeed follow in his older brother's footsteps. While maybe not the most spectacular playing ever, he does as good a job as you could possibly expect from him.\n\nThe songs are very enjoyable for the most part (assuming you can ignore Johan crying out in the most boring way possible), and I'd have to say that it rivals Stigmata in terms of overall quality. The solos are the best parts, but there are plenty of positives to take out of this album. The only negatives are that the sound quality has a tendency to let down the quality of music being played and (of course) Johan Liiva's abilities are far outshone by everyone else's.\n",
        "\nIf you've checked out the two releases that came before this one then you'll probably know what's coming: I'll praise the musicianship in terms of Daniel's drumming and Chris and Michael's skill on the guitars and then I'll slag off Johan Liiva. Then I'll probably bang on about the sound being unclean and then go back to bitch a bit more about Johan and how he sucks eggs. Maybe throw in a comment or two about how I'm glad they changed their direction after this album and then top it off with something about Angela being better than Johan. That's pretty much how it tends to go.\n\nThe opening twenty or so seconds of The Immortal were actually an interesting experience for me, and it continued on throughout that song: the guitars sounded weird and out of tune in the parts that I'd normally consider the highlights of the tracks. Admittedly the solo section is a fine one (what else do we expect of one of the best guitar pairings in the business?), but for the most part they fail to sound appealing to me. Normally I'd just gloss over it, but there is another unexpected entity in this song: Johan Liiva actually sounds decent. It sounds as if he's actually trying to do something interesting here rather than just randomly speak over the top of epic guitar hooks, and suddenly I find that it's bearable. More than that, it's kind of enjoyable. Weird, I never thought I'd say that about Johan.\n\nIt's not a trend that continues for the entire album (the next song goes back to something more reminiscent of the last two albums), but as a whole Johan sounds much more engaging and like he actually cares about what he's doing. It does make me wonder why he suddenly found himself sacked after his first performance that was somewhat okay, but I'm just going to go out on a limb and say that his replacement still outclasses him by a long margin. Still, well done Johan. I'm pleased to see that you did something that could be seen as good while in AE.\n\nFor the most part the sound on this album is cleaner, and thankfully for the rest of the album the guitars are in tune. I do enjoy most of this album a lot more than the past two Liiva albums thanks to that, along with the vocals being much improved. It's strange how much one thing can impact the rest of the band, but this shows it.\n\nThe music on this album is also more catchy than that of Stigmata and most of Black Earth. That helps me to engage with it that little bit more than the past two albums as well, and I really find myself getting lost in the stuff that's being played. Maybe this points towards the style that they shifted their focus to after the end of this (albeit in a slightly different way than this), but I enjoy most of this album to a great extent.\n\nSadly there is an exception to the great progress they've made that isn't The Immortal, which happens to be the title track. It's more like a doom/death mix, more specifically something along the lines of sludge. While it's interesting to hear them try something different, I've never managed to enjoy doom metal to the same extent that many other metalheads do, and I do find it very boring at the extremely slow pace they're playing at. The atmosphere is admittedly very good (not many times that I pick up on that), but I enjoy the tracks along the lines of Seeds of Hate to a much better degree.\n\nAll in all though this is a nice record and I'm left to ponder exactly why it took this long for Liiva to leave any kind of impression on me. It came at last though, and he has (to some degree) saved his reputation, but I'll always look back and think of him as the guy that came before Angela who was terrible at his job thanks to the two previous albums. Maybe he should have tried doing his job sooner.\n",
        "\nI've never denied that Johan Liiva's vocals put me off of Arch Enemy's old stuff. In fact, I've claimed many, many times that his vocals (I'm not sure there's another word to describe them) are shit. They always sound like he can't be bothered and half the time it sounds like he's just speaking angrily. Many people will disagree, but I for one am of the opinion that he is far outclassed by his successor Angela Gossow. And that's just why this album seems like such a great idea - it makes songs that were previously degraded by Johan's awful vocals actually enjoyable without having to wonder how much better they'd be as instrumentals.\n\nSomething that I noticed immediately is that the music is recorded in a different note and the production is much cleaner. I actually prefer it like this, but the fans of old AE stuff will probably complain that it isn't as heavy as the original version. Not that we care about what they think, because most of them only listened to this so they could proclaim how much better the band was before Johan was so rudely kicked out. Times change guys, get over it already.\n\nFor the most part it's refreshing to hear the classic songs played in a different tune and produced in a manner that is far cleaner (slightly odd considering that most of their work is only between ten and fifteen years old), but sometimes it doesn't work. Songs like Beast of Man are kind of odd to listen to, because on one hand they're nicely produced but on the other that's not what they were meant to be like. I still prefer the newer version of most songs (there is one exception that we will come to in a minute), but I actually liked that song before they released this record. Bridge of Destiny is far better on The Root of all Evil than on Stigmata, but Beast of Man is kind of equal on both sides. It just sounds a little bit too clean for what the song intends to be, even with Angela's demonic growls. The only thing stopping the older version being better are Johan's vocals.\n\nNow, the one exception I said I'd come to: Diva Satanica. Originally I heard that song on the second CD of Wages of Sin and it was one of the most crunching tracks I'd heard at the time. Johan's vocals aren't great (as you may have guessed), but at least they're bearable on that track due to the fact that they fit in far better than with some other AE releases. This new version isn't anywhere near as heavy and suddenly it loses its edge. I don't particularly like Angela's growls on that song either, high screeches that don't belong with this band and the deeper growls don't really do too much for me either for some unknown reason. This is the only exception where the original really outclasses the rerecording.\n\nI can see why a lot of people would take a disliking to the band for releasing this, whether it be because they feel Johan's work has been done a major injustice or that Arch Enemy are just trying to make some easy money or some other reason. Personally though, I do quite enjoy listening to this, although there are maybe a few songs on here that could have done with being replaced with others. I don't view this as an attempt to steal the public's money, and actually I think it's a good idea to introduce the newer fans to the old material in a more accessible way.\n",
        "\nWell, I finally did it. I decided to take the time to listen to one of Arch Enemy's older records, and I have to say that even reading the other reviews I knew I wasn't going to like it. Many of them seem to say that Johan's vocals are fantastic (something I disagree with to a great extent), but I hoped to at least be able to count on the guitars being good enough to cancel this out. Thankfully, for the most part this does happen.\n\nPretty much every track is full of an epic mix of brilliant hooks and heavy riffs, and due to the fact that it's one of the best combinations of guitarists we're talking about here, it all blends together very well. Coupled with some good drumming and bass playing (although it's not Daniel and Sharlee on this record), the music is really quite good. It's just a shame that Johan's vocals are so poor that they drag the music down to a status far lower than it otherwise would be.\n\nI liked the track 'Bridge of Destiny' from 'The Root of All Evil', which had been re-recorded on all the instruments and had Angela doing the growls rather than Johan. And as soon as the song starts, I can tell I won't like it as much. The guitars don't sound as crisp as on the newer recording and just generally don't sound as good. Coupled with Johan's vocals being nowhere near the caliber of Angela's (I can barely tell what he's trying to do here, it just sounds like he's talking), the song just isn't as good. People can say what they want about 'The Root of All Evil' being bad (and indeed it is a bit of a waste of time for a lot of fans), but most of the songs are far better after being re-recorded (there are some exceptions, such as 'Diva Satanica', one of the few AE songs that sounds better without Angela on it).\n\nThe best parts of the album are probably the solos. Every track manages to put something else into it, from 'Sinister Mephisto' (which is pretty boring besides the solo) to 'Bridge of Destiny' (even if it isn't as good as the newer version) to 'Tears of the Dead' (one of the best songs on the album). A lot of songs that would otherwise be lost on me due to Johan Liiva's voice suddenly have a lot more listening potential thanks to the work by Mike and Chris.\n\nNot all of the tracks have to rely on a solo to get me there though. The opener, 'Beast of Man', is an excellent work of musical art, and I can listen to that track over and over and over again. The quality of recording does seem a little low here (although it does throughout the entire album), but the music is great. It's a lovely mix of heavy verses that are almost raw death metal and some memorable hooks in the chorus. Daniel Erlandsson is also on this track, so the drumming is more what I'm used to and it fits well with what the Amott brothers are playing (not that it doesn't on the other tracks). What I will say though is that even if it doesn't have to rely on the solo to make the song good, that's still the best part of the song, and it does help to tip the bar a lot further in the direction of liking the song than it would have been without it.\n\nTo sum everything on this album up, Mike and Chris deserve a big congratulations for performing such incredible stuff. Not just them, but the drummer Peter Wildoer and bassist Martin Bengtsson for the solid job that they do as well (even if I do prefer the guys that replaced them). The only thing that are missing from this record are better vocals (as you might have figured out by this point), and it's quite strange to realise how much of an impact they actually have on the music. Previously I could just kind of listen to the music for the melody that the other instruments create, but now I know that's not the case.\n",
        "\nThe problem with metal bands today is that they have this bizarre idea of being able to either maintain a consistent style from one album to the next, or make the equally grievous mistake of evolving their sound. If a band does one, they should have done the other, and vice versa, and frankly any band that does either ought to be ashamed of themselves and just hang it up, or at least that is what most would tend to say on the subject. Then again, simply having the popularity and resources to field a well polished album can bring out the heretic hunters if one isn't careful. Given the impossible quandary that this standard held by some tends to create, one might decide to do something crazy and simply reject the whole premise, and maybe commit the ultimate blasphemy of all time, namely considering an album based on its musical merits.\n\nArch Enemy are one of many to fall into this quandary, with people going to either side of the fence and either expecting musical Armageddon because of Alissa White-Gluz coming in to replace Angela Gossow, or expecting an overly safe rehash of similar territory to the last couple of albums. To be fair, an album title like War Eternal boasts a massive musical undertaking that ends up falling short of its promises when considering the actual album, but in spite of playing it safe, Michael Amott has managed to put together a decent album that will keep most of this project's core audience satisfied. At times, this album almost stumbles into similar territory as Gossow's crowning achievement with the band The Wages Of Sin, opting for a slightly more power metal-like take on things in line with the Finnish take on the style, but stops just shy of closing the deal.\n\nIn a nutshell, one could chalk this album up to being a slightly catchier yet less elaborate version of Khaos Legions, complete with a similarly predictable songwriting method and posh production. The massive sound of this band is further bolstered by a greater helping of symphonic elements than usual for the band, culminating in an opening prelude dubbed \"Tempore Nihil Sanat\" that reminds a bit of how bands like Heathendom mesh a heavy, down-tuned sound with high fantasy infused classical music. Things take on a fairly fast and energetic approach once the rest of the band chimes in, culminating in a few fairly solid thrash-infused crushers in \"As The Pages Burn\" and it's more blast-happy cousin \"Never Forgive, Never Forget\". Nothing gets quite as intense as an offering out of The Crown, but there's a slightly greater helping of speed on here relative to the past couple albums.\n\nFor the most part, this is music that is easy to digest, having a few technical wonders spliced into a limited box a time here and there, but largely keeping things predictable and methodical. The obligatory fast but not too fast material that rounds out the promotional songs on here, namely \"You Will Know My Name\", \"No More Regrets\" and the title song could very well have been put together by a symphonic power metal outfit like Nightwish or Epica, though those who might fear that the band morphed into one can rest assured that Alissa's vocals, while not a pure carbon copy of Gossow's, sticks to the same uniform harsh style and leave the melodic material to the guitars. Pretty much the only surprises on here is the greater presence of brief instrumental interludes, all of which are loaded with cliche melodic hooks and somber atmospheric elements, and the bonus Mike Oldfield cover on the digipack version, which has essentially been morphed from a folk/hard rock song into a coasting Hammerfall or Dream Evil song with shouted vocals.\n\nThe only logical reason for hating an album like this would be for believing that a band absolutely has to change their style significantly. While there is something to be said for a band that stays a little too close to home and doesn't branch out at all even within their chosen sound, that's a pretty easy argument to discard where this album is concerned. By the same token, while Arch Enemy has continued to cleave to a traditional melodic death metal sound throughout their career, they've never really stood out as being the go to band for said scene either. They are basically a band with 2 rather effective gimmicks, and their strongest one is their lead guitarist, as opposed to their vocalist(s), contrary to what many have said. Arch Enemy could stand to think a bit more outside the box in terms of songwriting and maybe not boxing their virtuosic lead guitar breaks into such tight time boxes, but the contents of this album are not terrible, though definitely tried and true by this point. If one already likes this band, it's hard to see this album breaking any hearts.\n",
        "\nI'm a big fan of Arch Enemy. Even when they've been slagged off by everyone else, I've stuck with them and (for the most part) enjoyed the stuff that they have released. Unfortunately, 'Anthems Of Rebellion' falls far short of the band's high standards, further than 'Khaos Legions' and only slightly better than 'War Eternal'.\n\nLet's get something straight: there are good songs on this album. 'Dead Eyes See No Future' showcases the beautiful melodies they can come up with and I'd go as far to say as it belongs with Arch Enemy's best works. 'Leader of the Rats' is also a great song, particularly the versus (not something you normally say about melodic death metal, but there's a first time for everything). However, even these songs are flawed. The verses in 'Dead Eyes See No Future' are a weak in comparison to the epic chorus, and it's almost the other way around on 'Leader of the Rats' (as well as having a bit of an \"Insert solo here\" sign hanging over middle of the song where they almost take a break). It would have been better if they'd made a track that was a combination of the good parts of those two songs, even if it would mean another shit track on the album.\n\nEverything else... The nicest way to put it is that it's one of the most monotonous things I've heard. 'Silent Wars' is filled with fast drums... and that's about it. 'Instinct' starts off interesting but quickly becomes pretty boring as the ideas are just repeated over and over and soon you just want it to be done. Then 'End of the Line' is pretty plain as well (although it does feature some clean vocals, which is a bit different).\n\nIn fact, that's how I'd describe the whole album. Pretty plain and boring, not much variety. It's not like their last record where there was everything you could want in terms of a balanced diet of metal, this one just feels like the same kind of riffs churned out over and over again. There are good points, like the aforementioned 'Dead Eyes See No Future' and 'Leader of the Rats' as well as some decent tracks like 'We Will Rise' and 'Saints and Sinners'. However, the song 'We Will Rise' is incredibly over-hyped for a fairly average song (barely even clearing the barrier for what's metal and what's not) and 'Saints and Sinners' is kind of boring in places too.\n\nAs for the bad tracks, well... Let's just say that 'Dehumanization' pretty much covers it. I mean, what even...? The track is right up (or down) there with the worst that Arch Enemy have put out (the club with such \"elite\" members as 'Hybrids of Steel' and 'Thorns In My Flesh').\n\nLet's be clear on this matter: Arch Enemy is a great band, but this album is definitely not a great album. Far from it. All I Could Bleed's album 'Burying the Past' was better than it. That says quite a lot considering how poor that was and how great AE are supposed to be. Thank god that they redeemed themselves with every single other album they released with Angela in the band, otherwise people would have a pretty good case for saying that Johan was the best thing about the group.\n",
        "\nBy this point in Arch Enemy's long career, most people have probably got bored of their sound and decided to ditch it and go listen to something else. Because I'd never been into death metal when this stuff was released (heck, I didn't start listening to this stuff until five years or so later), I just found all of Arch Enemy's stuff instantly captivating. This album stands out from their other ones, but I wouldn't say it was their best album.\n\nWhy not? Mostly because unlike 'Wages Of Sin' and 'Doomsday Machine', there are multiple songs that I dislike on this album. I don't mean to name and shame any in particular, but... Who am I kidding, I'm looking at you 'I Will Live Again', 'Revolution Begins' and 'The Great Darkness'. The first one tries to do something different and fails miserably, the second just gets a bit repetitive and generally isn't something to get excited about until the end (admittedly I did enjoy the outro), and the third felt a bit out of tune for the most part and just wasn't to my liking.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, onto the good bits of the album. As a whole, the sound for this album is consistently faster and heavier than most of their other works. Unlike their previous album 'Doomsday Machine', Angela's voice sounds human rather than robotic (thank fuck) and that adds the feel of the music. The rest of the stuff is what you'd expect from the band, only heavier than normal. 'The Last Enemy' and 'Rise Of The Tyrant' are good examples of this, as they show that - while they have melodic parts - they're focused on delivering something slightly harder than they did with their last couple of albums.\n\nA song that I feel is significantly underrated on this album is 'In This Shallow Grave'. No one ever seems to mention it, not just in terms of it being a good song but there also don't seem to be any real critics of it. It's almost as if no one has actually heard it. It jumps right into the song with fast and heavy riffs and pacey drumming, topped off with some harsh death growls. Then all of a sudden when it hits the chorus one of the guitarists starts playing a few nice hooks over the top of the continually heavy riffs and drums. Some people will think that it doesn't fit, but personally I love it. Still, I'd expect some critics of the song at least, but their attention seems firmly fixed on 'Night Falls Fast' and 'Revolution Begins'.\n\nThe only (decent) songs on the album that don't follow the general outline are 'The Day You Died' and 'Vultures', which add a little bit of variety to the mix but aren't really the best songs on the album. 'Vultures' starts off in quite a different way with two guitars doing different things that come together nicely, but ultimately it just turns into a fairly generic melodeath song. It does have some good parts to it, but six minutes is kind of stretching my patience with the same riffs and hooks over and over again.\n\nOverall, I would say that while as a whole it doesn't top their last album, certain points of 'Rise Of The Tyrant' are better than those of 'Doomsday Machine'. Another strong showing by Arch Enemy with another great album, which pretty much cements their reputation as one of the legends of melodic death metal (in my eyes at least).\n",
        "\nI think that it's fair to say that 'Khaos Legions' is regarded with its fair share of hate among the metal community. It's also fair to say that it is far from being Arch Enemy's best work, no matter what your take on the band is. However, I firmly believe that this album is nowhere near as bad as some people will try to tell you it is.\n\nTo be honest, while this album was a little unspectacular it was extremely solid throughout. Unfortunately that's what really lets the band down: nothing on this album is really anything special. More than half the album was decent and most of the remaining songs are at the very least listenable, but there isn't really anything that stands out as being exceptional. The album's best songs are all near the start or in the middle, and at the end of the album it really does feel more than a little bit lackluster considering what they've done in the past.\n\nThere are good things about this album, such as the variety still being there. Once again there are slow songs, heavy songs, melodic songs, instrumentals, etc but there isn't really the typical kind of kick-ass song you'd expect from AE (you know, the kind with the thundering riffs mixed with a melodic chorus and an epic solo). Angela's vocals are as strong as ever, as is Daniel's drumming (which is shown off at various points such as 'Vengeance Is Mine' and 'City Of The Dead'). The Amott brothers seem to have lost a little of their mojo in some of the songs, and Michael's writing is pretty poor for a lot of the album.\n\nSomething that annoys me on this album is the last half of 'Through The Eyes Of A Raven'. The majority of the song is pretty good, and I'd probably say it's my favourite part of the whole record. The chorus is beautiful, the verses a delicate in-between stage from melodic and heavy. And yet for some reason the solo (a part in which Mike and/or Chris usually excel at) just sounds so out of place. It's not particularly good either, so there isn't any kind of compensation to take from it, so why the hell is it there? From that point it goes back to the pseudo-heavy riffs that were used earlier on and just kind of plays out until the end, no fancy outro, no more melodic guitars, nothing. For a song that started off so promising, it really is a bit of a letdown.\n\nAnother track that annoys me is 'Thorns In My Flesh'. Seriously, what the fuck is going on? The first few chords don't sound like melodeath and the verses don't either. And then the chorus... Just no. No, I can't. I just can't deal with that shit. Sure, it's melodic, but it's not good melodic. And then the random bit on the guitars at the start decide to return again, and by this point I'm done. I have no idea what they're trying to do here.\n\nIn a way 'Vengeance Is Mine' is similar to 'Through The Eyes Of A Raven' in that it does sound pretty good for the most part (especially Daniel's drumming), but yet something lets it down, in this case the chorus. It just feels out of place (again) to have a chorus that is pretty quiet and restrained in an otherwise brutal song. Then 'Cult Of Chaos' has the opposite problem, where the only good part is the chorus.\n\nIt isn't all bad, as tracks like 'Yesterday Is Dead And Gone' show, but this album was a lost cause before it even went to market. Even the aforementioned track doesn't have anything on most of AE's previous stuff, even some of their pretty average stuff. The forty seconds of 'Turn To Dust', one of the instrumentals, pretty much summed up my feelings about this album. It's a sad sounding track that does make you wonder why you're wasting your time on this album when there are so many high-quality songs out there you could be listening to.\n\nIt does sound like I'm slagging the album off quite badly, but it's not as bad as everyone makes it seem. I don't know, maybe I had my hopes set too high, but 'Khaos Legions' really felt like it fell short of the mark. Considering that their last two albums were some of my favourite albums, maybe I did expect a little too much from them. Unfortunately though, the few bits of scrap salvageable from this shipwreck weren't as great as I'd hoped for. \n\nBut before I finish this review, I will say that it is at least better than 'War Eternal' and 'Anthems Of Rebellion'. Neither of those two albums had as much going for them as 'Khaos Legions' does, and at least the majority of the tracks on this can be listened to to some degree.\n",
        "\nNot many people dispute the fact that 'Wages Of Sin' is the best album Arch Enemy released with Angela at the helm of the ship (although fans of the original band lineup may disagree about it being the best AE album of all-time). And despite the number of great albums that they've put out over the years, I have to agree with that as well.\n\nThis is quite possibly the only album I've ever listened to where I don't feel the need to skip a single track (usually there are one or two annoying tracks that I can't bring myself to listen to). Literally every song on this album is a masterpiece. You have the fast and melodic songs like 'Enemy Within' and 'Burning Angel', the slow and heavy 'Savage Messiah' and 'The First Deadly Sin', the melodic intermission 'Snow Bound'. Literally everything on this album is great.\n\nI was never a fan of Johan Liiva, but it's undeniable that Angela Gossow far outclasses him. Obviously he has a lot of fans, but I find myself falling far outside that circle. To be honest, they're the one thing that put me off of Arch Enemy in the first place. With the rest of the lineup unchanged, you kind of know what to expect. The Amott brothers throw insane hooks and solos around the entire album, coupled with solid riffs in the background by whoever's turn it is to play rhythm rather than lead. Meanwhile Daniel drums solidly throughout, large portions of the album played with rapid double bass that match the general pace of the songs. He does prove that he can tone it down and play slower, more rhythmical parts as well on tracks such as 'Heart Of Darkness'. There isn't really too much point in mentioning Sharlee as we know that hardly anyone will hear most of his work, but we also know that he's an excellent player that keeps the time well.\n\nWith so many good tracks on this album, it really is nearly impossible to pick a favourite. It just sort of depends on what you're in the mood to listen to. My favourites were probably 'Burning Angel' and 'Savage Messiah', but I really could have said almost any of the tracks.\n\nMy only little niggle is that there are a couple of songs that pale in comparison to others. For example, 'Heart Of Darkness' seems far worse when listening from cover to cover than it would if you were to just listen to it on its own, purely because it's sandwiched between two of the best songs on the album ('Burning Angel' and 'Ravenous'). If you were to listen to 'Behind The Smile' next to these songs, I'm pretty sure it'd seem worse as well.\n\nSo that covers the first CD, the one with the new works on it. But the version that I own came with a second CD, one featuring older songs that were unreleased or considered hard to find. Unlike the first CD, this one features Johan Liiva doing the vocals (which did initially put me off of listening to it).\n\nWhen I gave it the chance though, there were some pretty good songs on there. 'Starbreaker', a Judas Priest cover, is an excellent song full of fast drumming and heavy guitars (tuned lower than on the first CD, making them seem heavier) where you can almost forget about Johan's poor vocals. To be honest though, they aren't even that bad on that song, it's more 'Damnation's Way' that shows just how shit he can be. The music is so good, but the vocals just sound dead out of place. It doesn't even sound like he's singing or growling, just kind of talking over the top of the music without any kind of method. It's a shame really, because it pretty much ruins an awesome song.\n\nAll in all an excellent album with an additional seven tracks to keep the Liiva fans happy (four of which I will admit I liked). This is genuinely a record that I feel will go down in history as one of the peaks of melodic death metal, or indeed metal as a whole. Music doesn't get much more perfect than this.\n",
        "\n'Doomsday Machine' is regarded in many different ways and is very much a 'love-it-or-hate-it' album. For the most part, more people seem to hate it than love it. Once again I show my taste in music as being different from most other human beings on the planet as this 'Doomsday Machine' is among my very favourite albums.\n\nReally, I don't see what's lacking with this album. You have the likes of 'Mechanical God Creation', a slow and powerful song with great variation in the way the guitars are used, then you have the likes of 'Nemesis' that feature high-paced drums and heavy riffs in the verses and the most beautiful chorus you will likely ever hear. Not to mention every single other type of track in-between.\n\nI can see why it's not for some people, of course. That reason for a lot of people is Angela Gossow (in particular people that liked Arch Enemy when Johan Liiva was the vocalist). And to be honest, her voice on this album is one of the very few things that I don't like about it. On every single other album her vocals are solid and you can tell that they've not been tampered with in the editing process, yet for some reason on 'Doomsday Machine' they decided to do exactly that. For the most part they just sound off (sometimes nearly even robotic) and there are very few parts on the album where we hear her real voice. Considering how complete the album is, this is particularly frustrating.\n\nAside from Angela's voice, there are a couple of other niggles I have with the album. One of them is the whole of 'Hybrids Of Steel', one of the two instrumentals on the album. I don't know why, but the whole thing just sounds like one big mess of randomly strung guitar chords. Now, I like a bit of variety in my music, but that track doesn't quite fit the bill. The other thing is that a few of the songs get a bit samey after a while (which is not generally a problem unless you intend on listening to the album from cover to cover multiple times).\n\nEverything else on this album is nearly complete perfection. From the Amott brothers and their epic solos (and playing in general), to Daniel and his spectacular drumming (particularly on the faster songs) and even Sharlee's bass-work (when you can hear it, which - as ever - is not too often). The number of different styles of death metal these guys can play on one album is incredible. The place the Amott brothers contribute most to on this album is probably on 'Nemesis', while with Daniel I'd say it was 'Machtkampf'. Sharlee's work is harder to say, but he does get a noticeable solo on 'Skeleton Dance' and he does play extremely well to keep time on the faster tracks.\n\nMy personal favourite song on the album is probably 'I Am Legend / Out For Blood' (although with the number of great songs it's nearly impossible to choose). The track is a kind of average pace, but is also one of the heaviest songs on the album. The guitar work is excellent, a wonderful mixture of fast riffs and melodic hooks as well as a great solo to top it all off. The drums are fast and pounding for the most part, keeping in time with the guitars, but there are several parts where Daniel just decides to add a little bit of excitement and play an almost solo-like section of a few seconds. On this track as well I don't seem to mind Angela's voice as much, although that might be because of everything else that is going on.\n\nSo to conclude, I really don't see what people are talking about when they say this album is \"a fail\" or \"completely boring\". I found it (and still do find it) one of the most varied and one of, possibly even the most enjoyable melodeath albums to listen to.\n",
        "\nFirstly, I have already reviewed the complete album of the same name. However, I felt that the title track was so much better than the rest of the album that it was necessary for it to have its own review. The rest of the album just doesn't do justice to this song (who thought we'd ever hear that sentence?).\n\nLike many other people, I wasn't looking forward to this album with 40% of the famously solid lineup changed. As a result I didn't listen to track as soon as it was released and I certainly wasn't going to pre-order the album. However, after listening to the song my opinion changed. The song was a nice surprise given my low expectations, and I honestly thought that maybe the lineup changes had done the band some good. Was it as good as the best point on 'Wages Of Sin'? No. But was it better than what 'Khaos Legions' had to offer? Definitely. 'Khaos Legions' was an okay album, but that's all it was. It was nowhere near as bad as some people will have you believe, but it certainly wasn't the band's finest work. It didn't look like it was going to much trouble to surpass that mark with the new album (although sadly that didn't turn out to be the case).\n\nAlissa's gutturals aren't quite as good as Angela's in my opinion, but they far outclass those of original vocalist Johan Liiva. If nothing else, they are at least listenable without thinking how much better the music would have been without them being there. As for the guitars, Michael Amott delivers his usually solid performance with a nice mix of heavy chugs and melodic leads (as well as a kick-ass solo, as per usual). The replacement for the other half of the Amott brothers, Nick Cordle from Arsis, does a surprisingly good job (no disrespect to him, but he had big shoes to fill and I wasn't expecting him to manage to fill them). To be honest, you wouldn't have known it wasn't Christopher playing if it hadn't been for the fact that he'd announced his departure already. As for Sharlee and Daniel, they also deliver their usual kind of quality with Daniel's pounding beats in the background of the music keeping time nicely, although Sharlee's work is once again all but drowned out by everything else that is going on.\n\nThis track shows just what the band is capable of, unlike the rest of the album. I mean, it won Metal Hammer's award for best metal anthem for fuck's sake! Unless every other track entered for that award was utter shite (which I highly doubt), surely they must have done something right with 'War Eternal'. So one question remains then: why on Earth is the rest of the album so bad? They'd done something right to the point that this song might be considered by some one of AE's all-time great songs, so what happened to the rest of the album?\n",
        "\nWill they be any good? Can they match the bands back catalogue? Will the band even continue? What do you do when the one of the leading and most inspiring female vocalists and front-women in heavy metal departs the band? These are some of the questions fans of Arch Enemy resonated when Angela Gossow announced she was leaving the band and going behind the curtains into their management section. Big shoes indeed for former The Agonist singer, Alissa White-Gluz to fill however there is little doubt in anyone\u2019s mind after hearing the latest opus War Eternal that the answer to the above questions is a resounding \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nOf course this isn't the first change of lungs Arch Enemy have had in past years. The quintet replaced Johan Liiva in 2000 with Angela to solidify them as one of the first female fronted death metal bands, and 14 years after: still as inspiring as ever and improved by the reignited fury of Alissa\u2019s vocals.\n\nSo now with a worthy replacement vocalist-recommended by Angela herself-the group went into the studio to form their 10th studio album War Eternal. Previous albums by Arch Enemy keep to the melodic side of death metal and you can tell they are very much at home on their new release. However, from the first howl off Never Forgive, Never Forget, you can tell arch enemy are back; back with a vengeance. There a few surprises such as the symphonic haunt of the intro and intermission tracks however there is plenty of swerving guitar riffs and pummeling blast beats to please the old fans.\n\nWhat gives them their renewed power is Alissa\u2019s contribution to the record. From the soaring choruses of As The Pages Burn and Avalanche to the accessibly epic On And On are landmarks to her different level of dynamics compared to Angela\u2019s harsh snarls complete with the impressive lyrical composition of You Will Know My Name. This goes hand in hand with the classic blast beats from Daniel Erllandsson\u2019s drumming and Michael Ammot\u2019s brutal riffs.\n\nAny doubt that fans of Arch Enemy had prior the release of War Eternal have been well and truly demolished. The tracks on this album can easily stand beside songs off Anthems Of Rebellion or Doomsday Machine but now, improved by the fact they now have a singer that can match their unique sound. A fitting reminder from the new title track lyrics stating: \u2018Remember who you are\u2019...\n",
        "\nI'll be honest, I was one of the few people that actually listened to Khaos Legions and actually quite liked a lot of the tracks on it. There are probably a few people sitting reading this thinking now that this review is not worth wasting their time on, but I liked (or at the very least could listen to) more than half of the tracks on the album. Unfortunately, this isn't the case with War Eternal. \n\nObviously, the band was thrust into the spotlight when Angela Gossow announced her departure. I'll admit that I was looking forward to listening to the new album up until that point (even if Chris had decided to call it quits already), but this kind of put me off. It's not to say that without Angela the album was instantly unlistenable, but think back to Johan Liiva's god-awful vocals from the first three albums. They are the biggest reason that I prefer the band's modern works, because Angela delivered exactly what was required while Johan was incredibly inconsistent even from one track to the next. So, to suddenly be told that Angela wasn't going to be on the album suddenly made me wonder if the album was actually going to be any good. Yes, there are better vocalists out there, but she's always delivered (except maybe on Doomsday Machine, but that seems down to whoever put so many layers in her voice) and at the end of the day the band worked very well together. When I heard that her replacement was the girl from The Agonist, my first thoughts were along the lines of \"Oh great, Arch Enemy's going for this again.\" I'm pretty sure every single person that knows anything about the band thought the same thing. Still, maybe I should wait to give her a chance, right? \n\nSo I listened to the title track pretty soon after it was released, and the music didn't seem that bad. The vocals took a bit of getting used to, but it could have been much, much worse. Nick's playing was so good that at one point I actually forgot that it wasn't Chris that was playing. At this point things were looking up. Even with 40% of the band's lineup being changed, Arch Enemy still seemed to be putting out some solid stuff, and maybe the new album could bring them back to some degree of respect within the metal community. However, when I heard 'As The Pages Burn' the sinking feeling returned. The song started out well, but Alissa's vocals just didn't fit it for me. Then the chorus was a bit of a letdown. And then the verses started to sound tired. Basically, it was uninspiring and monotonous, and I think this was what put me off of buying the album straight away. Having listened to the album in its entirety now, I know that I won't buy it at all.\n\nAcross the whole album there really is nothing to get excited about. The vocals are of a far lower standard than they used to be (although happily they still outclass Liiva's by a huge margin), and I have to wonder exactly why they chose Alissa for the job. Her growls are mediocre at best, and something about them grinds my gears, but I know that she can certainly sing. At least in The Agonist she could show off that part of her skills, but Arch Enemy was never a band for clean vocals and I doubt she'll ever get to use them there. It just seems like a waste.\n\nNot all the blame goes to Alissa though, because Michael's writing has really let him down this time around. There were a few tracks that started really well (for example 'Avalanche' and 'As The Pages Burn' as previously mentioned), but ultimately most of them came to nothing. The song 'No More Regrets' that a lot of people on the internet seem to like just feels a little too much like an attempt to be Dragonforce or another speed metal band along the same kind of lines with no real feeling behind it and don't even get me started on 'Never Forgive, Never Forget'. Even on the band's albums that are viewed very negatively, there was always at least a few gems. Here, the only good song is the title track.\n\nThe thing that gets me is that the album was made out to be the band's return to form (although the definition of that is somewhat subjective), but in actual fact is the worst thing they've ever produced. I really disliked Anthems of Rebellion, but this album doesn't even manage to lay a hand on that, never mind Wages of Sin or Rise of the Tyrant. Considering the immense talent of all the musicians in the band, War Eternal was a real letdown. Michael Amott remains one of my favourite guitarists, and I recognise that Sharlee and Daniel are usually incredibly consistent and deliver 99% of the time. Even the new recruits have shown that they are talented elsewhere in the metal industry. I severely hope that the band can come back from such a low with their next release, but I have an awful feeling that this time the ship is going to stay sunk.\n",
        "\nAfter Mike Amott's last contributions to the legendary Carcass, he formed Arch Enemy with brother Chris to ride the wave of the then up-and-coming melodic death metal genre. As with basically every band ever, they started off strong and have since slumped into the pit of suck. 16 years later Amott and co. are currently hitting stages alongside other sub-par acts based on the stratagem of a female-fronted, family-friendly pseudo-melodic 'metal' band. If you're a more modern fan, I suggest you fuck off. This doesn't concern you. Maybe this is why I like history so much...\n\nAs Beast of Man tears your tweeters asunder, the first thing you'll notice here, is that this album has balls. We can thank our good fiend, Freddy Nordstr\u00f6m, for adding some true heaviness to this slab. I can't help but find myself wondering, 'what the fuck happened'? This was recorded in 1997...says so right there. Has the illusion portrayed by the inferior schtick that today's groups are releasing [i. e. modern-era AE] as melodeath taken hold? Seriously, what the fuck? The difference is this offering actually has DEATH METAL in it, and in 2014 it still sounds more muscular than the air-brushed scene productions we hear today. Shameful.\n\nA guitarist's wet dream: Six strings dripping with semen, inverted, piercing the twat of some large-breasted leper as she slowly bleeds to death....It is sheer joy to hear the shredding of the Amott brothers. Uh, Stigmata anyone? Think of those leads from Blind Bleeding the Blind and Pedigree Butchery. Mike took huge inspiration from Bill Steer (how could he not?) and created similar licks and leads that are here aplenty but with a certain majestic poise about them. I'd call this adventurous work; it feels like trekking through the forests of an ancient land. Above you skies change from a foggy grey dawn [Dark of the Sun] to a blistering scorched afternoon [Black Earth] into the moonlit haunted evening [Bridge of Destiny via Vox Stellarum]. In between you are thrust into the thick of battle [Let the Killing Begin] with it's militaristic snares marching forward & almost-silent, lucid and BASS-Y moments of blood-smeared clarity. \"As the beauty of Death sets in.\" \n\nThe lyrics are penned mostly by Mike and are your standard fare. I'll mention briefly that Johan Liiva's vocals are nothing to get excited about. Some of you may be interested to know that they are of the 'clean-gruff' variety wherein you may discern a few words here and there but overall, totally forgettable, even pointless. \n\nIn conclusion, this is well-written material with a huge emphasis on guitar-playing. I want to stress that and make the distinction between well-done and 'wanking.' All leads and solos are integral pieces to the compositions herein. If you have a copy of this, cherish it. It may be the apex of AE's career.\n",
        "\nI want to be perfectly clear that the derisive title refers to Mike Amott, not Alissa White-Gluz, the band\u2019s new vocalist. Mr. Amott used to be an inspiration as a death metal guitarist, one of my all-time favorites, even. However, over the last decade his songwriting has become a cookie-cutter, paint-by-numbers, faded, photo-copied, re-purposing of all his older work. All of Arch Enemy\u2019s material since \u201cWages of Sin\u201d has been at best an uninspired rehash of the band\u2019s glory days, and at worst a shameless dry-humping of all us fans willing to pay good money for the next album, which we all hope sucks a little less than the last.\n\nIf Arch Enemy\u2019s back catalog isn\u2019t enough (seriously, compare the music on Burning Bridges or Stigmata to the swill that was \u201cDoomsday Machine or Khaos Legions, fucking please!), this same phenomenon is sadly, glaringly obvious in his once incredible stoner rock band, Spiritual Beggars. Sometime around 2001, Mike Amott lost his mojo and entirely forgot how to write new material.\n\nMore proof lies in the band\u2019s - let\u2019s be honest, Mike\u2019s - decision to hire Alissa White-Gluz as Angela Gossow\u2019s replacement. With Angela\u2019s departure, the band needs a new vocalist, someone who has a capable death growl that won\u2019t overshadow Mike\u2019s now dwindling guitar creativity. That\u2019s it, those are the only requirements. Being attractive, having a vagina, or the ability to make sultry, fuck-me eyes in music videos are not prerequisites for a vocalist in the Arch Enemy I used to know\u2026and yet, the band chooses a gorgeous woman to yet again lead the campaign to collect our hard earned cash. Worse still, Alissa\u2019s vocal range is stellar; have you heard what she did in The Agonist, or how she filled in as Nightwish\u2019s live vocalist? She\u2019s quite talented, has at ton of range, and yet she\u2019s relegated to a dry monotone death growl for the entirety of War Eternal. Seems like the Arch Enemy Corporation has fallen back on the same \u201chot frontwoman\u201d gimmick and the same old formula they\u2019ve been using since 2001 to mask the fact that they\u2019ve got no juice in the songwriting department anymore.\n\nWar Eternal is a paltry album, played by some of the most indolent virtuosos in the scene. Sure, the two opening tracks are decent, as \u201cNever Forgive, Never Forget\u201d and the title track start the disc out with the best the album has to offer. These two songs, however, comprise the only decent material on the disc.\n\n\u201cAs the Pages Burn,\u201d \u201cStolen Life\u201d and \u201cOn and On\u201d (and fucking on and on and on and on) are utterly forgettable filler tracks that further demonstrate that nobody in the band seems to care about whether their songwriting ideas are blatantly recycled or middling. And while we\u2019re weighing the filler, let\u2019s throw in three utterly uninspired instrumentals and a lifeless cover of Mike Oldfield\u2019s \u201cShadow on the Wall.\u201d That\u2019s a lot of fluff, but we haven\u2019t gotten to the best part yet\u2026\n\n\u2026because the band has chosen to sneakily expand their sound to include keyboards on this disc (instead of leveraging Alissa's wide array of vocal deliveries), and the result is a train wreck that is somewhere between cringe-worthy and utterly laughable. \u201cNo More Regrets\u201d hits a sour chorus melody over and over, which manages to ruin the song, while \u201cAvalanche\u201d and \u201cYou Will Know My Name\u201d both invoke this new trick with true impotence. The jewel in this crown of shit, however, is the aural abortion, \u201cTime Is Black.\u201d All I can think is that this song has to be the band\u2019s bid for the next James Bond movie\u2019s theme song. Listening to it causes me embarrassment for Mike and crew, in all seriousness.\n\nWar EternaL\u201d offers two passable songs, and then shits all over them throughout the remainder of the disc. This album ranks down there with the band\u2019s worst. The most discouraging part of it all, though, is that with the lineup change, Mike and AE have clearly signaled they don\u2019t know they\u2019re perilously close to hitting rock bottom, and will continue flying their craft in the direction of the ground.\n\nMike needs a break, a walkabout, or a near-death experience to jump start his creativity again. I don\u2019t care if he starts shooting smack, fucking more of his groupies, or gets caught shoplifting dildos - I'll accept anything to get this guy\u2019s brain and guitar on the same page.\n\nAs a final ounce of bile for this miserable album, please consider Bill Steer\u2019s/Carcass\u2019 17 year hiatus. Was Surgical Steel not the most magnificent work of death metal in 2013? Compare the dynamic, passionate, aggressive material written by one of Mike\u2019s former band mates to any of Arch Enemy\u2019s tepid ejaculations in the last decade, and I have what I believe is a strong case not to see another Arch Enemy album released until 2031 (do the fucking math).\n",
        "\nI'm not going to lie and act like War Eternal was some big disappointment or surprise to yours truly. To be honest, Arch Enemy have never done much for me, and other than select songs from Wages of Sin and Doomsday Machine, I have always met upcoming material of theirs with a catch-all shrug of insouciance. Give me Colony or The Jester Race instead, which are loaded with hooks and continue to serve as reasonable gateways to harsher auditory realms. The albums fronted by Liiva are good for what they are, but fucking Khaos Legions? Unimaginative and inoffensive at best - merely a vehicle to keep the tour dates rolling along.\n\nThe only reason one could conceivably be invested in Arch Enemy in 2014 is regarding the controversial lineup shift. Say what you want (as I have) regarding the post-Burning Bridges material, but Gossow was a solid face for the band. More importantly, her status as one of the few lone females vocalists in a genre naturally dominated by men served as a refreshing change of pace, primarily due to her status as a non-gimmick. She did her best to fit in, and despite the band receiving some ancillary attention for her inclusion, they generally let the music do the talking. Whether or not that music was any good is an argument for another day, but the point remains. So with Gossow out and the band in the throes of a period of identity crisis, they bring in Alissa out of nowhere. The same Alissa who wore stripper outfits with handcuffs dangling off of them for The Agonist. \n\nIt may seem gratuitous to dwell on this for so long, but it is necessary because the band promoted her arrival so prolifically; hardly a display of restraint in any event. While Gossow came off as a truly intimidating femme fatale force that could kick even my ass, Alissa is just spineless in comparison. It doesn't help that she looks about fourteen years old, rendering the music videos into the equivalent of a middle school girl throwing a temper tantrum backed somehow by a metal band. To add insult to injury, her harsh vocals just aren't that great. She got more mileage out of her stint with The Agonist due to the prolific use of cleans, cleans which obviously have no place in a stagnant act like Arch Enemy. She doesn't project herself very well, instead using too much of her throat when she screams as opposed to the diaphragm. It just sounds thin and weak, no matter how hard she tries. The lyrics are also complete swill, which is by no means new territory for the band, but should have been rectified the moment a fluent English speaker came on board. What happened there?\n\nThis leaves the music itself, which is wholly pyrrhic melodic death at its most refined and stock. The biggest deficit revolves around a marked lack of memorable licks or hooks. This is melodic death metal right? Amott somehow missed that memo, as these songs rumble by with such stock intentions and intensity that they fail to generate anything even bordering on head momentum. The exceptions are actually quite memorable, although one could reasonably chalk this up to a lack of anything worth a damn elsewhere. At any rate, \"Stolen Life\" is really quite good and to the point. That melodic lead during the chorus screams of Megaman X or something and reminds me why this is such a long-lasting and prolific sub-genre. Damn solid, as is most of \"You Will Know My Name,\" which tries really hard at subtly selling out during the chorus, but is otherwise worth the price of its admission.\n\nThe rest is just...there. The title track's riff set has some weight to it, but the lyrics are at their most banal and it really fails to get anything cooking once it breaks out of that short groove sequence during the intro. \"Avalanche\" sounds damn promising at first, but quickly devolves into faceless genre-posturing. This brings me to the keyboards, which are used rather extensively but fail to add anything to the music. It just comes off as a distraction and embarrassing attempt at adding a faux-epic element to increase the scope of the sound. It simply grinds with the rest of the music due to a general lack of memorability. The only saving grace here could have been the solos, and while most are generally passable, they aren't necessarily worth a second glance, either. \"Never Forgive, Never Forget\" is the one possible exception here, as it has a pretty decent extended effort by Amott that at least reminded me that the music was playing.\n\nI just don't know otherwise, perhaps my lack of commitment to Arch Enemy in the past has clouded my opinion, but I honestly thought that this perceived freshness would make War Eternal a more exciting prospect. I will never forgive the band for the stolen life that this album has cost me. It just goes on and on and...man I'm bored.\n",
        "\nOK, someone's gotta say it...this whole replacement frontperson business Arch Enemy has undertaken could NOT have come at a better time. Not a whole lot has been said about the group in recent years, and things didn't appear all that grand during such a time; Chris Amott left out of the blue, the past couple albums have been pretty lackluster, and attention had begun to cumulatively wane. Then came ANOTHER sudden departure and replacement that thrust the group back into the spotlight, where their welcome thus bade was not without plentiful bouts of uncertainty on all sorts of folks' part. Not that I can blame them; I mean, there are still kids out there who believe Angela WAS ARCH ENEMY! I'm sure a certain Michael and Johan would like to have words with them. But alas. Would this level of scrutiny be unwarranted, or justified, with this latest recording? Let's find out...\n\nAfter a rather sinister synth intro, it's down to business in a pretty big way with a serious lack of fucking around. A swift punch in the face that is \"Never Forgive, Never Forget\" opens the door for a medium pace-level of torturous pounding that takes up the majority of the album. Taking a more melodic route with only a few moments of their earlier sense of brutality, AE craft a competent affair that is sure to be seen as a pleasant surprise to those who'd dare think otherwise. The sense of songwriting is tight as all get out, the guitars and drumwork simply devastate, the lead guitar and keyboard harmonies offer plenty of tingles up and down the spine and some tasty dynamic shifts make the best parts shine and the lesser sections a bit dreary. The amount of riffs are of a smaller amount this time around, which is both a good thing in that they don't bludgeon you with a \"too much, too soon\" approach, but it does render some of the songs a bit more repetitive than they should be despite the RUSHRUSHRUSH! tempos spat out here and there. I guess even the best of us outgrow the shoving riffs and leads down the listeners' throats appeal in favor of something that resembles REAL songwriting. Is I wrong? Probably, but when it works, it works, and comes off as pretty damned inspired nonetheless.\n\nThat being said, though, \"War Eternal\" still suffers from the biggest issue regarding melodic death metal no matter how good or large-and-in-charge the band is; it can only offer so much upon first glance (the title track is the biggest example, I must say...), and at 13 tracks it risks being long in the tooth near the end, but that being said it still seems to offer a a more cohesive set of ideas and movements than the flat dreck of \"Rise of the Tyrant\" or, more glaringly, \"Khaos Legions\", though not by a whole lot. It's not all that removed from that which made them a household name around the days of the \"Ravenous\" music video, but it does sound more inspired than before. As for Alissa's vocals, she thankfully doesn't try to replicate Angela's manly growls and instead opts for a more legit melodeath feel that's more her than anyone else, as best she can, it sounds like. Most of the time her verbal cursing and utterances work rather well given the more actualized style versus her early days in The Agonist (less core, more war), but other times it just doesn't feel like it's enough in certain spots. Still, one can't hold that against the lady regardless of where she came from. I'd like to see YOU do better, ye naysayers! ...too far? My apologies.\n\nAt the end of the day this didn't make me a huge Arch Enemy fan, nor did it make me a fan AT ALL, but I can honestly say that this wasn't all that bad in spite of itself and what high expectations other fans and interwebz shit-talkers would dare thrust upon their shoulders. While really only worth a listen or two when the itch for it hits, for straightforward melodic nastiness you can do far worse. Trust me on this.\n",
        "\nDefinitely better than Khaos Legions without a doubt. Arch Enemy steps up with fury on here. Alissa sounds like a replica of Angela though with moderate variety. The music and intensity is strong and the compositions are reflecting of older AE, sticking to the core of melodic death metal. Nick, their new guitarist replacing the amazing Christopher Amott, did a superb job here. I still favor Christopher, but his endevours are different now that he's no longer with the band.\n\nIf this is to be the last AE, it would be a tragedy. I'm hoping with this newer lineup they still have some more albums to belt out. The music on here is a blend of the first 4 albums and the bonus track \"Shadow On the Wall\" is a good cover. The guitars are heavy and the lyrics are brutal reflecting the songwriting from Michael and Nick. I'd say most of the guitars are in C, making them thick and chunky. There is a mixture too with keys as intros among outros with melodic guitars.\n\nHere it seems like the ideas of the past have reiterated themselves, especially reminiscent of Burning Bridges especially on the outro song entitled \"Not Long For This World.\" Very much like Burning Bridges outro track. The album intro is a lot like what you'd hear from something Cradle of Filth would do. Not saying that they're copying them, just with the keys/synthesizers are much like that of COF. Track 2 belts out some ferocious guitar and vocals not to mention tremendous blast beating that's only on this track. \n\nThe leads by Nick are quite technical and well composed and Michael's are like that of his traditional approach to his \"feel\" like talents. He is less technical than Nick in the lead department. It's good that the band decided to put out a couple of music videos before the album was released in the states. It gave a good feel for what was ahead to hear on here with no surprises. Their path once again isn't reinventing the genre, just doing a praise for it, never abandoning their roots. Alissa's energy is reflectant of Angela's. Deep throat to about the same degree.\n\nI especially like the title track (which is a given) and \"You Will Know My Name\", of which they also did a video for. These were 2 tracks that glorified the album. The heavy guitars accompanying the intensity of the vocals were quite in unison. All of the tracks to me are good, bar chords, tremolo picking galore, hardcore shredding and music that is with a huge amount of feel thanks to all of the band member's efforts. I think that seeing those videos beforehand gave me hope that this would surpass their previous by a ton!\n\nIf your thing is melody mixed with heaviness and production quality that is superb without sacrificing talent in the overuse of technology, War Eternal is some great melodic death metal. The heavy guitar alongside the melodies really shine here, going back to the older days. I still feel no one can replace Christopher Amott, but Nick is quite good, implementing some impressive solos and songwriting ideas. Michael sure picked someone also to emulate Angela. Alissa's intensity is sure there like Angela's was. The band doesn't go mainstream here, they remain true!\n",
        "\nShow of hands, who listened to Khaos Legions? \n\n*crickets*\n\nSee, 2011 marked a strange time for Arch Enemy. For the first time since the turn of the millennium, nobody gave a shit about the band or the fact that they had a hot blonde growling like a demon. People had finally gotten tired of their shtick, and the grrl power fangirls and horny zitfaced dorks that helped propel them to superstardom in the early 2000s had presumably finally grown up and become a cog in the machine or touched a boob for the first time. Arch Enemy is one of the safest bands in the universe, and Khaos Legions was their wake up call that they needed to do something different, challenge themselves, or even just fucking give a minute amount of effort in order to regain all the fans they'd apparently lost over the course of the decade.\n\nEnter War Eternal, the heaviest, most aggressive, and most creative album they've presented fans with since Black Earth all the way back in 1996. Those soaring melodies are now unlike almost anything I've ever heard, creating soundscapes that elicit haunting imagery and empowering violence. The vocals have been amped up and given a huge amount of diversity, ranging from really deep, Immolation-esque bellows and high pitched shrieky insanity like Nattramn or Maniac. There are little touches of brilliance scattered throughout the runtime that they'd never have dared to touch on before, like much more aggressive drumming, dissonant, twisted riffing, and a new focus on atmosphere above all the straightforward rocking. It's so different from the uninspi-\n\nYeah you didn't buy that shit for a second, did you? Of course they didn't do anything new, they just replaced Angela with a younger and hotter girl and then wrote Wages of Sin for the sixth time. Because of course they fucking did.\n\nI gotta say, I may have thought their music sucked for the past fifteen years, but I did actually respect Arch Enemy for never overtly sexualizing Gossgow. Amott kicked out Liiva because he was an awful vocalist (and if you disagree, you're in denial), Gossgow got the job because she was a fan who loved those old songs, had a much better voice, and great stage presence and chemistry with the rest of the guys. She dressed like a metal fan, she acted like a metal fan, she just simply was a metal fan and the fact that she was thin and attractive was just a peripheral thing that she and the rest of the guys never put much stock into. When Angela decided to step down from performing, Amott could have hired anybody to fill her shoes, and the fact that he chose Alissa White-Gluz shows that I was wrong all these years and the band really does just want to milk the \"hot frontwoman\" card. I gave the band the benefit of the doubt and now I look like a fucking idiot. Take one look at the music video for the title track here and you'll see how unashamedly shallow the band has gotten with their image, with Alissa in this sexy skintight outfit with strategically placed rips and tears, moving her hips seductively and pointing at the camera. Gossgow put on war paint and combat boots and raised her fist, White-Gluz gives fuck-me eyes and dances like a stripper. Fuck all of you talentless hacks. You wanted attention? Well fuck you, I'll give it to you, it just won't be anything remotely positive.\n\nWar Eternal is, at its core, just another bland and faceless Swedish melodeath album. If you couldn't see this band, you would never care about them; I feel like the band has come to realize this, so they put minimal effort into the musical aspects of their business, instead making damn sure they look good enough to sell tickets and VIP meet and greet packages. The album tries to fake you out a few times, like with legitimately very aggressive verse riffs in \"Never Forgive, Never Forget\" and \"Down to Nothing\", and a few melancholic acoustic intros in the middle of the album, implying that they might let the vocals showcase their talents (I mean the girl sang with Kamelot and filled in for Nightwish, she obviously has to have some pipes) by moving the songs into completely unknown territory. But no, there are just three songs in a row with a fakeout intro before going straight back into the old \"Iron Maiden with growls\" thing the band always does. Alissa is relegated to hitting one note the whole album, and I guess I get it since that's the same note the band has always hit for the past several years and they clearly didn't want to try anything different, but it just hammers home how terrible of a choice she was for the part. She has range, she has diversity, she has talent, but she's pretty and can growl, so just stand there and look pretty and growl.\n\nI realize it seems like I'm letting the outside aspects of the band influence my opinion of this album, and maybe I am, but this is a rare case where such a thing wouldn't be unfair. It all just coalesces into this giant statement that hammers home how hollow the record truly is. There's no passion here, it's just eleven cookie-cutter melodeath songs with two pointless interludes and that's it. It feels like nothing more than a necessary prerequisite for promotional photos and touring. I wish I could explain in more detail precisely why War Eternal is so inconsequential, but really you could just listen to any of the last six albums and understand exactly why. The whole album is full of passionless non-riffs and harmonized leads while a rhythm section exists in the background and some vocals function as white noise in the foreground, that's it. That's the whole album in one sentence. Potentially the worst part is that, like always, the leads are very, very good. This is the first time they've released an album without the greater Amott, but Michael and the dude from Arsis do a fine job of playing off each other, widdly weeing away very frequently and almost always with exciting results. It's such a shame that a talented player can be such an atrocious writer, because as soon as he sits down to write anything that doesn't sound like it could be played on a breezy mountaintop complete with sweeping crane shots of his hair blowing in the wind, he presents one of three inconsequential riffs and seven of nine Iron Maiden melodies layered on top. With the exception of some (admittedly pretty neat) synths in \"Time is Black\" and \"Avalanche\", every single song follows the same template with the same key and same tempo and same theme and same everything.\n\nWar Eternal is just uncreative and uninteresting and that's really the beginning and end of it. One aggressive riff and one synth line don't make up for the other nine songs of pointless filler, recycled melodies, and uninspired vocal lines. It's melodeath-by-numbers and I can guaran-goddamn-tee you that once I press the \"publish\" button, I'm never going to listen to this again. It's a pointless nothing-album that inspires no emotion other than all encompassing boredom. There's nothing worthwhile to be found here and all but the most diehard fans of the band are going to find nothing to warrant more than one curious listen. And the band has shown time and time again that they really have no intention of injecting these new hook focused songs with the dark splendor of the older songs, despite that being essentially the only thing the band could logically do at this juncture to make themselves interesting again from a musical standpoint. \n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nWar Eternal is Arch Enemy\u2019s tenth album and the first to feature Allisa White Gluz on vocals, since long term vocalist Angela Gossow\u2019s departure from the band. The injection of new blood doesn\u2019t do much to reinvigorate them though, and while not terrible, their latest effort is definitely an underwhelming one.\n\nAlissa\u2019s growled vocals are only decent, while there is a lot of passion behind her rasped growls, they are very one dimensional, and get rather stale over the course of the album. While their\u2019s a certain viciousness to her voice, it\u2019s all one deep raspy growl for the whole album, with little variation. While it\u2019s not the worst growl in death metal, it\u2019s still far from the best, and with many better vocalists out there, you have to wonder whether she was chosen on her vocal ability, or to keep up the appeal of their having a growling female fronting the band.\n\nMusically it\u2019s nothing special either, with riffs mostly consisting of dull chugs and overly melodic cheesy \u201chooks\u201d. There are a few that rip, such as that killer pounding opening to the title track, but for the most part, they\u2019re decidedly average. While not exactly terrible, there\u2019s very few that are exciting or memorable through the course of the album. The problem extends to the lead guitar too, with Michael Amott playing his predictable saccharine scale runs, which for the most part sound dull and uninspired, not one solo from the album really shreds or has a sense of the epic. A few less solos, and more refinement on some of them might have yielded better results. The cheesy synths on Time Is Black only add to the saccharine cheese of it all, and thankfully they\u2019re only present on a few songs. The drums only follow the music, and with little in the way of interesting fills or any intense blasting sections, as well as a squeaky clean production which takes the bit out of everything except the vocals, the whole thing just feels somewhat neutered, especially when the inaudible bass gives nothing in the way of any extra crunch, and Arch Enemy never get the chance to crush. It\u2019s not a terrible effort, it\u2019s not a good effort, it\u2019s just kind of there, and definitely sits as the most average album of the year so far. The highlight is War Eternal, but that doesn\u2019t say much.\n\nOriginally written for swirlsofnoise.com\n",
        "\nArch Enemy is back! After a quick switch of vocalist and guitarist, they've released their tenth studio album. There were certainly enough people complaining about Alissa's vocals when the singles were released, so how did the album turn out? Does it still sound like Arch Enemy? Are there any songs with clean vocals? How loud do I have to play it to blow out my eardrums? All these questions and more will be answered below.\n\nWhen the War Eternal single came out, I listened to it and thought to myself \"yep, that's an Arch Enemy song alright\". The only thing that's really changed is the vocal style; the guitars and general song structure are all the same as they've been for the last 18 years. So if you're one of the people that were complaining about the singles, I'm sorry to say you're not going to like this album. Guess what? Alissa is the vocalist for the entire album. However, if you're a fan of Arch Enemy I definitely recommend giving the album a chance and to continue reading this review. \n\nThough War Eternal does sound like an Arch Enemy album for the most part, there are quite a few musical differences from previous albums. It's not because of Alissa either. If you look at the writers for each song, Nick Cordle actually had much more of an influence. War Eternal and You Will Know My Name sound like classic Arch Enemy songs and I could totally imagine Angela doing the vocals for them. But songs like On and On and Avalanche (two that Alissa helped write) stray from the formula and really serve to shake up the flow of the album. On and On just seems more layered and tries interesting sounds that you won't find on previous albums. It even has a breakdown! Something very rarely found in this band's songs, if at all. There's one in No More Regrets too. And yes, Avalanche has clean vocals during the chorus. And yes, they work really well even though this is an Arch Enemy song. Now stop complaining about the vocals.\n\nSpeaking of the vocals, Alissa White-Gluz does a great job taking over vocal duties. She brings her distinct and instantly recognizable style and it just works. I don't really have much to say about the vocals. They sound different than Angela's and you either like them or you don't. Personally, I like them. There's also a noticeable lack of songs about anarchy and more focus on personal battles and triumphs.\n\nWar Eternal does a good job of playing with the Arch Enemy formula that we've grown to know and love. You never know what to expect. One minute you'll be listening to symphonic keyboards playing in the background, the next a sick solo, and after that you'll be singing along to one of the many catchy choruses. The band definitely has more cooks in the kitchen, but they're able to divide resources effectively and come out with a great multi-layered dish where everything is different but still compliments each other. It's definitely a weird first listen, but the album grows on you very quickly.\n\nThere is only one particularly irritating blemish that I need to address. The song Time is Black. It starts off with some forced symphonic elements that aren't really developed enough to be atmospheric. Then comes the main riff which is... alright. Then the symphonic elements keep coming up. They're not utilized well and it really distracts from the song. The whole song keeps going back and forth between a stripped-down sound and parts that are supposed to be atmospheric. It doesn't really fit with the guitars during the chorus or the interlude(s). Whatever. The idea could have been cool if more time was spent on it. The symphonic parts are apparently done by a full orchestra but they just sound like someone fiddling around on a keyboard. It makes the whole song come off as out of tune. Maybe it will grow on me over time, we'll have to see. A much smaller complaint of mine is that there is a slightly awkward transition between verse and chorus in some of the songs.\n\nWar Eternal manages to have a nice mix of shaking things up and sticking to the tried and true Arch Enemy formula. It's not perfect but it hits much more often than it misses. Alissa and Nick are great additions to the band and really help to make this album stand out. I recommend any Arch Enemy fan give this album at least two listens. It's worth it. I'll definitely be catching Arch Enemy live when they inevitably come play in Canada.\n\nREVIEW ORIGINALLY FOUND AT http://metalontheside.blogspot.ca/\n",
        "\nThere's 2 periods to Arch Enemy: The Johan Liiva early days and the more modern Angela Gossow days. This is her first album with the band. I didn't buy the last album as i'd got bored of this band by then. However, this album is a near classic of melodic death metal. The early stuff is ok but i've never been a massive fan. The musicianship is excellent but Johan's voice is bland and the songwriting just wasn't as good. 'Wages of Sin' is the first album where the Amott brothers really stepped up to the top level.\n\nMichael Amott has history with melodic death metal from his time with Carcass. Angela is a known fan of Carcass and does her best to sound like Jeff Walker. This has led to many unfair criticisms of Arch Enemy being a mere Carcass clone. Although the influence is there, i'd say AE are much more melodic and safe. I say safe because after this album AE pretty much copied this blueprint for 5 albums to varying degrees of success. This album not only benefits from being the first of the new era, but also from a solid but not overdone production. Crisp and punchy without being too shiny. \n\nThe album starts with a creepy piano intro leading into 'Enemy Within' and then the riff-fest begins. The Amotts wheel out riff after riff on this album and most of them are great. I especially like the monstrous, near-doom riff of 'Savage Messiah' and it adds a nice change of pace to the album. Solos are also exceptional as you'd come to expect from these lads. They can play so well they should've had their own Guitar Hero spin-off! Easily one of the best guitar partnerships in the history of metal. \n\nDaniel Erlandsson capably handles the drums. He may not be the best drummer out there but his playing suits this style of music perfectly and he gets the job done. Same goes for Sharlee's bass playing, solid and dependable. he even gets a bass solo on 'Dead Bury Their Dead'! Angela's vocals can be a little monotonous after a while but they are certainly venomous and deliver these lyrics with real force.\n\nThe album goes a little flat after track 6 but only down to a level of decent as opposed to rubbish. Then we get a short instrumental, 'Snow Bound' with a nice guitar lead and suddenly we're hit with the album highlight 'Shadows and Dust'. Michael Amott's guitar solo is one of my favourites of all time, just fantastic fretwork.\n\nMy version of this album has a bonus track which is nothing special, but also a disc of rarities from the Johan era. 3 cover versions and 4 rare tracks from Japanese releases. All are of a reasonable quality and you've probably never heard Judas Priest like this before!\n\ni rate this album very highly, its appeal hasn't worn off despite the band no longer exciting me. A top quality Swedish melodeath album.\n\nRecommended tracks: Enemy Within, Heart of Darkness, Savage Messiah, Dead Bury Their Dead, Shadows and Dust\n",
        "\nAggressive, melodic, original, awe-inspiring, dripping with hatred, and wonderfully executed. My past dislike of Angela has dissipated and there are no more ill feelings towards her taking over in the vocal department with Johan fired for reasons unknown to me. Nevertheless, I'd have to say that this album is way better than \"Doomsday Machine\" and very much thought out more lyrically and musically. A great production sound and just pure furious hatred spewed forth alongside Michael Amott's melodies accompanied by his brother's incredible leads with utmost technicality. There were no real parts on the album that didn't dissuade me from liking the release.\n\nLoved the ongoing heavy guitar riffs which (I think) are B or C-tuned and solid. Tremolo picked frenzies along with melodies that are just rampant and miraculously composed. The vocals went well with the music and everything seemed to fit here. Varying degrees of tempo changes, but not very drastic. Michael just flexing out that wah-pedal with precision. This album brings me back to the days of \"Black Earth\" and \"Stigmata\" minus Johan. It's taken me literally years to accept the fact that he's no longer with the band and it's okay now that I hear Angela over Johan. I suppose that they really chose her because her aggression was far more than his.\n\nThere aren't any tracks that I dislike on this release, it's heavy pretty much all the way through. A great turn for the band and it's like reliving the \"Wages of Sin\" era, which I think isn't as good as this one even though my previous contention was that it was the only release I could tolerate with Angela doing the vox. But I suppose that fans didn't lose interest in the band and they continued to grow musically and getting a mixing/production gem-like in precision with no real flaws that I'd conclude with. A true damn heavy melodic death release and their best album in years.\n\nThe whole album has a combination of 3-4 different guitar variants: thick/chunky rhythms, some clean bits (but not many), wah-pedal melodies along with the chunky guitar bits. They really take the music and fire off some unimaginable songs that just own you. The technicality is there too, especially Christopher's lead work. Michael writing pretty much the most of the music/lyrics and Angela belting out heavy throat that turns the AE melodic death into a more extreme metal, death like in nature. Way more all encompassing than Johan ever was. I've heard the talk about the \"sex sells\" the music referring to Angela, but my view is now to a point to where I see it working with her.\n\nIf you have been following AE and have this, you'll probably conclude that like me this is their best release in years. With Christopher out of the band now and their latest \"Khaos Legions\" dismay, you'll find that this one is their last great effort. I'd conclude that the first 4 albums are monuments and this one belongs in the monuments section as well. If you lost interest in the band when Angela joined, give this one a try because you'll find all of the makings of a great album here triumphantly. A definite gem, emotion filled with Michael's amazing melodies mixed in with Angela's fury that keeps them in \"heavy\" mode accompanying the great guitar work here. Own it!\n",
        "\nAh, Michael Amott. I have been an enthusiastic admirer of his professionalism going all the way back to his days in Carnage, his first appearance as far as I can remember. While that band was short lived, being swallowed alive in the melee of Entombed clone bands that suddenly appeared like poisonous fungi after the release of 'Left Hand Path' (an amazing record, still), its roots went deep into the Swedish death metal underground, being an archetype, of sorts, for the kind of incestuous band-trading that Swedish musicians are now famous for - from the ashes of Carnage (or rather, its still-warm corpse) were spawned a number of bands, Dismember being the easiest to recognize. The Carnage album did come out on Earache (or was it one of that company's little side labels? I can't remember), at the same time as the exquisitely strange first Cadaver record, and while it didn't receive the recognition it deserved, it didn't exactly go unnoticed. Amott hopped from Carnage very quickly into Carcass, a band that was just beginning to peak in terms of popularity and technical song-writing (the nexus in the history of death metal where Michael Amott and Bill Steer came together was extremely fortuitous - we can thank fate, or the powers that be, that such a collaboration came about). This is the point where I first saw Amott play live - at a Death/Pestilence/Carcass show in Houston in (I believe) 1990 or '91. Pestilence were supporting the release of 'Consuming Impulse' and Carcass were there to play songs off of 'Symphonies of Sickness' - eat your hearts out, death metal novices. I remember very distinctly the first time I saw him in the flesh - it was a magic moment. He walked out on stage to test his guitar and effects setup... calmly strolling towards his stack while the packed house was busy chatting, drinking, and otherwise ignoring what was going on right in front of them. He took out his guitar, plugged it into the rack effects, turned on the speakers, and strummed it lightly - quickly playing a few riffs. The result was catastrophic - out of the house system oozed this monstrous downtuned black stench of a guitar sound (that beautiful Carcass guitar sound, you know what I mean), cutting through the noise of the crowd and over the music on the club stereo...all the heads in the place immediately snapped around and turned towards the stage, the talking stopped, glasses were dropped back to the bar, a hush spread throughout the audience, and mouths hung open in awe all around me. Carcass had arrived.\n\nAmott has said in several interviews that he considers Arch Enemy to be a continuation of his days in Carcass, and because of the success 'Necroticism' has had in influencing the latest generation of Swedish bands, what he is doing with this band doesn't sound out of place in any way with what is going on all around him, in his home country. I think that Arch Enemy, along with In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, and The Haunted, are now a complete music scene amongst themselves: going from one band to the other, you come across pretty much all the different ways that the Swedish sound can be manipulated. Everything else outside of this little group of musicians can be seen as derivative.\n\nThe guitar work on this album is (as you would probably expect) never less than dazzling. Michael and his little brother Christopher (who is a very good guitarist in his own right) wrote most, if not all, of the music on this record, and this band is really about all the different ways these two brothers can bring their combined talents to bear on forging a new melodic sensibility out of the typical Swedish death sound. Going from crushing rhythmic pounding to lighting-fast twin leads, sugary sweet harmonies to inebriating technical flairs, and from extremely aggressive tremelo picking to slow, drawn-out smothering melodies, they strive to exhaust the range of the metal guitar. There are several very good riffs or arrangements on this album - the intro/first main riff on 'Demonic Science' (absolutely magnificent - the drums syncopating perfectly, like a quickened Carcass riff), the intro/first riff on the opener, 'The Immortal, most of 'Dead Inside' (a clinic in writing melodic death metal), the harmonies beginning 'Silverwing' - there are too many to name them all. If you are a fan of the Swedish melodic sensibility, prepare to be completely overwhelmed by this record.\n\nHaving said that, I can't help but be a little pessimistic when it comes to reviewing this album on any other level. The Amotts have put so much into the guitar work that they have left very little for all the other elements that make up great music: there is not much depth to these songs at all. Perhaps that is as it is supposed to be: most of the NWOSDM bands are not exactly profound when you get past the flashy melodies. It is a strange predicament - while their melodicism is almost always brilliant, there is very little weight or substance to the music beyond that - their songs exists in the present almost completely, as something to be experienced, felt on the surface, and then forgotten. Ear candy, really. You don't find yourself returning to these melodies and pondering them, or searching in them for anything deeper than entertainment. Reading the lyrics on this album was frustrating for me, mainly because they didn't seem to really have that much thought put into them. They fulfill all the requirements of 'death metal lyrics', but the impression I received from a look at them was that they were done almost as an afterthought. How does the vocalist feel about that, I wonder? This is strange, to me, because they seem to deal with subjects or events from Michael's own life - including his divorce. I wonder what it's like to take horribly emotional events from your own life and turn them into catchy lyrics - I don't think I could do it. 'Burning Bridges' is all about catchiness. If you take it as such, not looking for anything else other than a diversion, this release is excellent. If you are looking for something more heartfelt, or emotional, then you would be wise to turn North from here. This is something that seems to infect the entire Swedish scene, even the black metal bands - I wonder why? They just approach the writing of music differently. \n\nUA\n\nErebus Magazine\nhttp://erebuszine.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nThis final album in the original trilogy of Arch Enemy's career is a different breed than its two predecessors. It's got the same burning distortion and ripping riffs that defined the Amott style of playing up to this point, but its emphasis on catchier songs made it lose that menacing, baleful edge that defined Black Earth and Stigmata. Burning Bridges moves even closer to heavy / power metal with lots of the harshness that wasn't foreign to the band at this point. The songs themselves aren't any worse for what they intended, except for the title track.\n\nNow of all the songs of Arch Enemy's first three looming albums, the song \"Burning Bridges\" is dogshit. It's very doomy, but it's so boring as it tries to fry melodic leads without any real direction. Liiva's coarse yells rule, as they do commanding the rest of the album, but the song is governed by robotic drumming and some annoying as hell mellotron. The rest of the album's drumming is like an artillery battery with actual fills and blasting that's potent and flow-friendly. The drumming on this one song is in a totally different realm than the rupturing blitz of riffs and arcane-like melodic death, but most of all it isn't good. \n\nThe best on the other end of the album are songs like \"Pilgrim,\" \"Silverwing,\" and \"Seed Of Hate\". Basically anything on here except \"Burning Bridges\" is awesome heavy / power metal influenced melodic death with classic singular / twin solos, pronounced harmonies, and sadistic delivery of riffs, bass, and drumming. It's the same early Arch Enemy unity, but with a radiant slant. The best of these is the cryptic, brooding verses of \"Seed Of Hate\" preceding the song's unassailable tightness in untouchable lead prowess and Liiva's fervent delivery. \n\nThe bonus tracks make a great expansion and top this album off better than the uneventful title track does. It includes a nifty, inscrutable instrumental called \"Hydra\" that'll leave chills. Title track aside, this is another stellar offering that ends the original trilogy of awesome Arch Enemy albums. To have continued down this direction would have made them a powerhouse in a different right than the mundane joke they're considered now.\n",
        "\nStigmata is not only the best Arch Enemy album, but one that reigns as one of the best of the melodic death genre. It furthers the dark nature of Black Earth and pushes it to a heavier, more profound direction. Not one song on here doesn't contribute to this album's core ethos of Iron Maiden's vivaciousness and death metal's wildness. With impeccable leads, furious riffs, and a cosmic scope, Stigmata is the most impressive, expansive Arch Enemy album and a lasting artifact of this era of melodic death metal.\n\nThe Amott brothers are at their tightest here. The shredded riffs expressed through that ripping distortion and tagged with booming bass is one of the cleanest-yet-grated jobs the band had. It makes for both rupturing, chaotic moments and melodic, expressive ones without disjointed, incoherent playing. To match is the straightforward, extroverted writing like on the soaring, vigorous title track or the massive, vast atmosphere \"Bridge Of Destiny\" with its faultless use of poignant twin harmonies. The rumbling bass underneath it all creates a gloomy tone who's notes are beastly and thick. Drumming as well is hectic and pummeling without overpowering the guitars. That tells of the wonderful production and proper balance between everything to capture that bliss point of melody and unobstructed aggression.\n\nLiiva's yells and barks do not falter, either, as he gives his most memorable performances. At times it may be preferred that he do actual growling, but his style fits so well here that there's no other voice to capture the same imposing sound. The best of this and everything else is on what amounts to be Arch Enemy's best song, \"Black Earth\". This is rage like the band never wrote before or after. Dark, ominous, enigmatic, spacey, and with doom and intensity like no other in the genre, \"Black Earth\" evokes an ageless sound. The song may be a little too dissonant following the tail end of that reverent solo section, but the rest of it captures a feeling of terror (especially with that opening).\n\nStigmata signifies the best of Arch Enemy's capabilities. From the forces of riffs to the more melodic, piano-led expressions of \"Vox Stellarum,\" the arcane core of this album keeps me coming back. It's a pretty basic album, but it mixes the right amount of death and power metal-esque leads into melodic death to be a genre classic.\n",
        "\nBlack Earth is high in quality on Arch Enemy\u2019s repertoire. Both Amott brothers knew they had to make an impression the first time around, so there was no doubt that all the goods were on the table with this one. Everything is coated in this ripping distortion and embalmed by dark, arcane atmosphere and soundscapes. It's so relentless and ferocious for melodic death of this nature with its deeply harmonized leads and monolithic scope. Erlandsson's playing is swift and thunderous like all drummers of his caliber should be.\n\nArch Enemy\u2019s first singer, Johan Liiva, performs here with nothing held back. His vocal style is unique but also a bit on the inhibiting side at first. His words can be clearly heard due to his choice of yelling roughly (like the thrash band Sacrificial), rather than outright grunts, growling, or screaming. It's an odd choice that grows to become rapturous and authoritative. On this matter, the first track itself is one of the best tracks on the album, displaying all the critical pieces of Arch Enemy\u2019s early style. Liiva there is fierce, potent and concentrated.\n\nBlack Earth's songs have memorable riffs and brilliant (including dual) harmonized leads and solos that make it easy to know one from the other. They're all unruly, brutal, brooding, and majestic compared to the rest of the Gothenburg stuff at the time. The album's akin to The Jester Race by In Flames, but certainly a different breed of melodic death and way more vigorous as it steers closer to Iron Maiden's dynamic side. The best part of the album lies with all the Arch Enemy albums - Christopher and Michael. Of any brothers, these two created the best blend of dark and light themes spoken through the riffs and leads. Focusing on the instrumental prowess is \u201cDemoniality\u201d and \"Time Capsule\". The former consists of is a single riff that drags for the entire minute twenty, albeit catchy for the first couple of repeats. The latter, \u201cTime Capsule\u201d, redeems the first instrumental. To me, this is one of the most beautiful pieces of all AE\u2019s instrumentals. It's so romanticized but executed in such a pristine fashion as to fit perfectly with the album's character.\n\nThis album kicked off what was a promising career. For the next two albums, Arch Enemy would go for two different styles of the same sound. One, Stigmata would be the mature, melancholic approach while Burning Bridges would be lighter. This entire trilogy is a world of its own to enjoy.\n",
        "\nNow I've made it pretty clear that I don't consider myself much of a melodeath fan, and long time readers probably remember that I gave Rise of the Tyrant a pretty harsh review when it was new, and alluded within the review that I really didn't like Anthems of Rebellion either. Now, that's all true, but I have to make one thing clear: I do actually like Arch Enemy. Perhaps there's a nostalgic quality for me considering, despite what I always say, they were the first band with harsh vocals I'd ever liked. I always claim that Children of Bodom was the band that warmed me up to the style, and that's mostly true because I was/am a MUCH bigger fan of Bodom than I am Arch Enemy and have listened to Bodom's good albums waaaaay more than the good AE albums. But really and truly Arch Enemy beat them by about a month. Because of this, I'm one of the few weird people who really, really likes Doomsday Machine, but in all honesty it's the only Gossgow era album that I find holds any worth. It's got some crappy tracks like \"My Apocalypse\" and \"Skeleton Dance\", but tracks like \"Out for Blood\", \"Taking Back My Soul\", \"Nemesis\" (which could possibly be their fastest song), and even the instrumental \"Hybrids of Steel\" really make up for the shortcomings in my mind. Now this is going to sound strange, but despite considering myself a fan of the band, I don't really like more than one Gossgow era album, and I have a huge issue with the Liiva era stuff as well.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is why I think The Root of All Evil is actually a brilliant idea. See, I agree with pretty much everybody in the universe who doesn't suck at music on this subject, but the songs on the first three albums were leagues ahead of the mostly uninspired crap that the band has been putting out lately. There was a much more prevalent aggression present and the melodies, while predictable, yes, were infinitely more infectious and memorable than turds like \"Leader of the Rats\" or \"Revolution Begins\". I'll go on record saying that \"Silverwing\" from Burning Bridges could well be my favorite melodeath song. But there is one glaring, unavoidable flaw with the early albums that makes me rarely want to spin them: the vocals were atrocious. I'm sorry, but Johan Liiva was a fucking terrible vocalist. He always sounded like he was lazily grunting out the words or just yelling like a wrestler instead of putting forth any fire or effort. It really brings down the soaring melodies and fast paced energy of the songs. When Liiva was given the boot and Angela Gossgow was brought in, the problems flip flopped. Yeah it's annoying how she layers her screams something like ten quadrillion times (which is one of my main problems with certain Behemoth albums, I'm looking at you, Demigod), but she has a legitimately good raspy scream that is just worlds better than Liiva's passionless bark. And therein lies the problem with the band as a whole, once they got a decent vocalist, they seemed to completely stop giving a fuck about their music, pushing out mostly lame, lazy plodfests. Which brings us full circle to why I not only like The Root of All Evil, but why I actually consider it to be Arch Enemy's best album. It is the only record where they managed to get a decent blend of good vocals and good music.\n\nWhen it comes to the real music, there are virtually no changes from the original cuts. I notice it seems like the instruments are tuned a half step higher, but that doesn't detract at all for me. Yes, it makes the songs less dark, but more exuberant. While I dig the aggression on the earlier albums, that was never Arch Enemy's strength. Their strength lies in the huge melodies and searing leads, not the deep crunch or pounding rhythms. This is a band that is all about the flash and the style, and less about the base itself. This can be a problem for most people, as the old \"Iron Maiden with growls\" criticism is no less true here than it is with In Flames or pretty much any other Swedish melodeath band ever, but there's a sense that there's something larger at work in these older tracks. Post-Liiva, they've been more about being catchy, but pre-Gossgow they were more about dark splendor. With the new, highly polished production, it does cheapen the idea slightly. The songs are now presented more like big, dumb anthems like the band has been trying to do ever since Wages of Sin, instead of the darker, more mysterious and strange songs they used to be. Perhaps this is because Painkiller is my favorite Judas Priest album, but I love big, dumb anthems. So this new gloss and presentation only adds to what were otherwise good to decent songs in the first place. In fact, I love the new production, as I don't feel like it saps any aggression out of the recordings, instead beefing them up with a more pronounced drum sound and tighter performances. It is indeed less organic and more manufactured, and I acknowledge the problem with that, but it works really well for the style that Arch Enemy plays so I have no real criticism in that decision.\n\nThe track selection is a bit wonky, with Burning Bridges being overrepresented and Stigmata getting the shaft, but apart from maybe \"Demonality\" they didn't choose any straight up bad or boring tracks for this compilation. The inclusion of both \"Bury Me an Angel\" and \"Silverwing\" alone make the album worthwhile though, as they're the two best tracks from the band's early era. Honestly, listen to those two tracks alone and tell me you didn't spend the rest of the day humming the chorus melodies to yourself. Some of the straightfoward burners like \"The Immortal\" and \"Demonic Science\" are improved with the new, thicker production as well, and \"Bridge of Destiny\" is just epic as all get out as a closer. \n\nBut really, I have to address the elephant in the room, the question on nearly every old fan's mind; why was this album made? The general consensus seems to be making a quick buck with little effort by rerecording old material, cashing in on their newfound fame that they didn't revel in quite as much when the band started off as little more than \"the new band by that Carcass dude\". But in all honesty, my belief (and apparently the belief of the band as well) is that this was done because they loved the older songs, and a majority of the newer fans had no idea they existed. I saw them live about five or six years ago, and the crowd (consisting mostly of teenage mallgoth kids and grrrl pwr! type drones) stood around looking confused when they played \"Dark Insanity\". Let's face it, this isn't Gossgow's fault. She was a fan of the early albums, that's why she tried out for the band when Liiva was kicked out, she loves singing these songs. Michael and Christopher obviously want these songs they wrote in the 90s to continue being a part of the band's legacy, as evidenced by the fact that they keep playing them in the face of moronic fans who didn't know they existed before their current vocalist. This was an album that the fans demanded simply by not knowing these songs were ever written. I see it as the band throwing up their hands and saying \"You know what? Fuck you guys. If you don't know these goddamn songs by now, we're going to make you know them\". This gives the band the satisfaction of being able to see a real response when they play early era classics, and gives new fans the pleasure of being given a selection of their best songs from the time before they had the vocalist that made them so visible in the first place. In a way, it shows that the band was always legit, and they're not just trying to exploit the fact that they have a female vocalist and apparently no angsty teenager had ever seen that prior to 2001. Plus they make that easy money and people like me who hated Liiva get to hear those great old songs with better vocals. Everybody wins.\n\nSo at the end of the day, what we're left with is a fun and melodic album from a band who has been fervently boring the crap out of me for years. This is a welcome change, even if they didn't actually write anything new. New fans were introduced to the old classics, the band earned the ability to play the songs they love live again, and old fans either get a beefy reimagining of the songs they already enjoyed (like me) or a pointless cash-in (like idiots). The detractors have been pretty vocal about this album and for once, I have to side with the band making all the money. The Root of All Evil is a killer album, and you should be ashamed for writing it off as a pointless cash-in.\n\n\nOriginally written for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nWhat's worse than cash-grabbing remasters? Cash-grabbing re-recordings! Remember the relentless thrashing days of Liiva? Well, here come the Amotts and Century Media to ass-rape those memories! \n\nSome would probably want to blame Gossow for this ass-hattery, but my instincts say it's the Amott brothers and wholly corrupt Century Media trying to steal money from the parents of the majority of Arch Enemy's current fanbase. You remember how disgusted and appalled you probably were when you heard John Bush shitting on the legacy of Joey Belladonna in Nuclear Blast's cash-grab known as \"The Greater of Two Evils\"? This is the Arch Enemy equivalent. While Angela is a competent vocalist, her voice does not work AT ALL in the Liiva-era material. Johan had an incredibly percussive and heavy punch that fits right in with the traditional death metal paradigm, while Angela has a high growl that fits more with the Gothenburg sound. \n\nAnother aspect here that ruins the listening experience is the overly polished production and higher tuning. Back when Liiva was behind the mic, the Amotts stuck with B-tuned guitars with a very thick, crunchy tone that's caught somewhere between the Gothenburg and Stockholm standards. With Angela, we get a very sleek, clean, and modern tone that's tuned to C standard. While one might think \"Oh, it's just a half step, what's the big deal?\", but that is a very critical half step. Just look at their rehashing of \"Incarnated Solvent Abuse\" - big difference, isn't it? Now imagine that applied to tracks from their first three albums with really thin and hollow production and Angela's demon snarls. Not a pretty picture, is it? The polishing of the rhythm section is also equally aggravating, the bass being buried underneath every other instrument and the drums embracing that annoying, modern, trigger-happy sound that now pervades every metal genre. \n\nThe only tracks that work are \"Beast of Man\" and \"Dark Insanity\", so if you want to check those out, go ahead, but you won't really get much from the experience, trust me. I haven't heard the bonus tracks that people in Japan and Europe have the displeasure of hearing, but however good they are, they're still probably just put here for the same reason the rest of this atrocity is here, to piss off old fans and steal the money of newer fans. Don't buy any hype people, buy the first three albums if you want to hear this material done the right way.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy promised killer riffs and intricate guitar work for Khaos Legions, and they delivered. On their last album Rise Of The Tyrant (not counting Root Of All Evil as that was a re-recording of older songs), I felt they were lacking in production value and a lot of the guitars and vocals blended into themselves, and the guitars also lacked a little in the intricate department. As a proper comparison, this album really resembles Doomsday Machine.\n\n\u201cYesterday Is Dead And Gone\u201d is the first single off of the album, and really shows off some flashy guitars, the most notable examples at the :38 mark and the solo at the 3:00 mark. Angela Gossow seems to get more demonic with her vocals, as they sound much deeper and should belong in an Exorcist movie.\n\u201cBloodstained Cross\u201d has one of the best examples of the melodic virtuosity that Arch Enemy performs so well. It starts off on hyper-drive, with screaming guitars and thrashing drums till it slows down for the chorus with overpowering vocals, with the guitars and drums filling the background, nothing too flashy. The guitar solo at the end is one of their finest yet and will stick in your head, much like the first solo in their song \u201cNemesis.\u201d\n\n\u201cCity Of The Dead\u201d is one of the best tracks on the whole album, right off the bat shredding your ears off. It then slows down into a pounding, ear-punching verse with brutally low vocals, which I might add are really low even for Angela. The drums are more on point here and really keep the whole track going when you think it might slow down too much.\n\n\u201cCruelty Without Beauty\u201d is another classic metal song. It\u2019s essentially a hybrid of Arch Enemy\u2019s speed metal with death metal elements, such as blast beats, haunting symphonic overtones, and darker guitar shredding. The slow intro will fool you into thinking it will be a slower type of song, which I really don\u2019t think exists in Arch Enemy\u2019s vocabulary.\n\n\u201cThorns In My Flesh\u201d is the most demonic I\u2019ve ever heard Angela\u2019s vocals. The abuse that her throat must endure truly amazes me. The guitars in this track remind me of their song \u201cHybrid Of Steel,\u201d as they really soar above the rest of the music and sound lighter than the rest of the album. The solos here are legendary, seemingly covering the entire fretboard at different parts of the song. The drums also closely resemble the same song as well, but it still stands out on its own.\n\nNow to get into the second bonus disc Kovered In Khaos. This bonus disc comes with only the special editions of Khaos Legions and they are worth the money. Here there are 4 covers, from the bands Kiss (\u201cThe Oath\u201d), Dream Evil (\u201cThe Book Of Heavy Metal\u201d), Discharge (\u201cWarning\u201d), and Europe (\u201cWings Of Tomorrow\u201d). My favorite here is the Dream Evil cover, as when I first started really getting into heavy metal, I would buy the Metal For The Masses compilations at Hot Topic and on my first comp this particular song is on it.\n\nArch Enemy, if it\u2019s even possible, have gotten better and matured beyond all of their previous releases. Maybe re-recording songs for Roots Of All Evil influenced them enough to expand and bring in musical elements that were non-existent before. Think Doomsday Machine times ten. This is definitely a must have for the summer ahead.\n",
        "\nThe music Arch Enemy released has become so tired its almost painful. I really wish it weren't this way because the Swedish melodeath band actually started off really strong and consists aside from the vocalist, of very talented individuals. I have reviewed one of their Angela Gossow fronted albums in the past and while I felt the major reason I didn't enjoy it was her vocal performance on Khaos Legions there are a slew of different reasons I just wasn't feeling it.\n\nThis time around there are a couple of major issues that prevent this from being a good album. The new issue I noticed (and keep in mind I say \"new\" because this is only the second post-Liiva record I've given a listen) is that the riffs are mind numbingly similar sounding to what I had heard on Doomsday Machine. I mean they were just different enough that I could tell I wasn't listening to that album. But my god if I had a dollar for every time while listening to Khaos Legions I thought to myself, \"hey this sounds like Doomsday Machine!\", I would be a rich man.\n\nIt's not just the riffs either, there seems to really be no way to differentiate the solos from each other. They all sound about the same! I don't know what is going on with Michael Amott but it seems like someone sucked all the creativity out of his brain because if this were another band it would be getting a call from Arch Enemy's lawyers over how they stole riffs from the band. It's really difficult to get over as well. It makes listening to this album tedious and boring and you impatiently wait for the few unique moments before the creativity drought ensues.\n\nThe fact that there is actually a good song or two is what saves this album from being a drink coaster. But trust me they are few and far in between. The bass intro to Under Black Flags We March and the verse riffs of the song are actually pretty song. I especially what the Amott brothers made up for the chorus. Is it flashy or technical? Not at all but it makes for a good song and that's what matters. I also enjoy the guitar harmonies during the chorus for City of the Dead. It brings to mind the old school In Flames style of guitar harmonies Jesper Stromblad is so good at.\n\nAnother thing that really rubs me wrong is that Mike and Christopher Amott have so much talent yet they write music that sounds so similar to what they did in the past. That really polarizes the listener. And even if you like AE there is a chance that you might grow tired of what they are doing and probably won't like this either. Hell Daniel Erlandsson has played with Carcass, In Flames and Eucharist. We all know the guy has got chops but unfortunately he just isn't allowed to showcase them.\n\nAngela Gossow once again proves she is a one trick pony. She continues to have her vocals screwed with giving them a fake robotic feel that just sounds terrible. You can easily tell this isn't really what she sounds like...in fact no one sounds like that because its messed with so much using layering and different things. Her lyrics are still atrocious as well. It has the angst and rebellion we have all experienced before...as teenagers. This topic is getting old and she really needs to expand her horizons to include different subjects instead of this lame stuff.\n\nArch Enemy continue their fall from grace with Khaos Legions. The material written for this album is so samey and similar to their previous work and not at all in a good way. The musicians all seem to be going through the motions and I can't help but think the song writers are going through a creative drought of sorts. Angela as usual is awful, nothing new there. If you were a diehard fan of something like Doomsday Machine then this album was made for you. If you are looking for something new or interesting I would move along.\n\nOriginally reviewed @ http://abaddonsmetalshop.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nGeeky spelling of its title aside, what first strikes me as absurd about this latest Arch Enemy album is the flag waving comic book appeal of its cover image. One gas masked lass surrounded by four others in some scene out of Killzone, waving their banners amidst some post apocalyptic wasteland. Naturally, this infers some manner of pride or conquest, which I'm assuming the band meant to enforce with their music and lyrics here. Let's face it, high visibility and appeal to 13 year olds and poseurs notwithstanding, this storied Swedish/English collaboration has not been on a roll these past few years. Personally, I've found that their best days are long behind them, peaking out on Stigmata and Burning Bridges ('98-99) when Johan Liiva was in the band, but at least early Angela Gossow era albums like Wages of Sin and Anthems of Rebellion had a handful of decent tracks on them. Not so for the ensuing Doomsday Machine or Rise of the Tyrant, and they REALLY hit a low with The Root of All Evil comp in 2009, a re-recording of cuts from the first three albums, with Gossow's vocals replacing Liiva, wholly unwelcome and unwarranted by any but the most tasteless and impressionable fan girls and khaos bros.\n\nSo then, how does their 8th original full-length Khaos Legions measure up? A 180 degree shift unto past glories? A competent and well executed foray into new terrain? To no real surprise or dismay, the answer would be a resounding 'neither'. This is nothing more than refurbished, vapid claptrap. Uninspired, recycled ideas performed with sterility for a Century Media paycheck, offal and fodder for the inevitable package tours with other high flight, overrated video rotators who bear the banner for 'extreme metal', when there is nothing whatsoever extreme involved. Really, though, that's not the main issue here. I wouldn't give two shits if Arch Enemy released a pop album the likes of Justin Bieber, if the music were not so predictably tired, cliche and ultimately a useless stain on the band's legacy which makes even the prior Rise of the Tyrant glow by any comparison. Khaos Legion might occasionally spew forth some half-baked, decent idea, or a riff worthy of the considerable talents of Michael and Christopher Amott, but in general it's as flat and exhausting as they come in the melodic death niche.\n\nFirst and foremost would be the vocals. Now, I've never really gotten into Angela Gossow's style in the past, and consider her a lousy replacement for Liiva. It's not a gender thing, believe me. She just seems so dry and inauthentic, using and layering a Carcass like sneer with virtually no emotional or dynamic range, and she somehow manages to sound both bored AND boring on this phoned in lump of polished plastic. I simply cannot bear her attempts to sound 'menacing' and/or 'dark' when singing such cliche lyrics as the chorus to \"Cult of Chaos\": 'There are many ways to die, but only one way to live. Let the cult of chaos reign, be as free as you can be!' or \"No Gods, No Master\": 'I am who I am. Take it or leave it. A rebel at heart'. This entire album plays out like some motivational self-help recording set to mundane metal music. A 'metal' album for folks who purchase the most generic, cliche-ridden greeting cards for birthdays and holidays. They'll occasionally toss in a little something extra to the mix, like the shrill backing vocal of \"Through the Eyes of a Raven\" or Angela's sparse but awkward black metal snarl, but nothing can save how bland this all comes across.\n\nI mean, really... \"Thorns in My Flesh\"? 'No more chains in my flesh! No more chains hold me down! I control my destiny!' It's two thousand fucking eleven. How about showcasing even an iota of creativity or poetic/prose sensibility? Hell, hire someone to do it for you. There are Pink songs deeper than this shit. But you know something? I might even be motivated to forgive or to participate in such inanity were the music itself not so banal. There are approximately two good riffs on the album. One is the Metallica-like speed/thrash frenzy in the verse of \"Cult of Chaos\", and the other the even more hyper shredding, escalated velocity of \"Vengeance is Mine\". Mind you, these are the 10th and 13th tracks, respectively, so you've got to wait a long time before anything of import happens, and even then, these songs contain their own share of bland power/thrash guitar progressions which sound like hand-me-downs from Accept, Judas Priest, or solo albums from their front men U.D.O. or Halford. For example, one of the riffs in \"Under Black Flags We March\" sounds like it was half-stolen from \"Painkiller\", and some of the lines in \"Secrets \"sound like knockoffs from late 80s King Diamond grooves.\n\nArch Enemy will occasionally surge into some mediocre death metal progressions in \"Cruelty Without Beauty\" or \"Through the Eyes of a Raven\", but it almost feels hammy and jarring next to the rest of the material. Wimpy transitions to cleaner guitars feel forced (\"Cult...\" again), and the leads throughout the album are crafted into these dramatic, limp wristed soap opera melodies. Such predictable, friendly patterns that Mister Rogers might like to whistle them to frightened neighborhood children. Not a single lead here stands out, stunning when this was such a strong component of the band back in the late 90s. What's worse, the album is 54 minutes and 14 tracks long (16 if you've got the Japanese bonus material), when it can't even assemble one or two tunes that feel suitably consistent, complete and engaging. Remember when they were writing 8-9 good songs on a CD with very little filler? Apparently they've decided to invert that practice.\n\nI have no automatic or absolute aversion to an album which features a sterile, pop production in accordance with a more 'modern' or polished evolution of the melodic death genre. Soilwork's Natural Born Chaos and Dark Tranquillity's Damage Done are two examples that leap to memory, but they both have what this doesn't: fantastic songs. Authentic, enthusiastic energy balanced against stirring fits of sadness, in both the lyrics and melodies. A hint of creativity, or of the unexpected. Khaos Legions is an almost incessant misuse of a group of talented musicians. Sharlee D'Angelo and Daniel Erlandsson provide such an uninspired rhythm section here that you could replace them with almost anyone else and not notice the difference. The plasticity of the production leeches almost all the Amott riffing of its edge, but in truth, they weren't doing an admirable job of it anyway, and in the end this is their most underwhelming, underachievement to date. It's past time to pack it in. No wonder they're all wearing the gas masks: this stinks.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe formative albums put out in the mid to late 90s by Arch Enemy, and their auspicious proximity to the latter day efforts of Michael Amott's contributions to Carcass are rightly praised as stalwart examples of how Swedish melodeath sounds when conforming to its peculiar orthodoxy. With maybe the exception of At The Gates, this outfit was much closer to the unique stylistic niche that was common amongst transitional figures between the early death/thrash scene and their progressive flirtation that, arguably, paved the way for this very style. This is the sort of blend of consonant, repetitive melodic figures and chaotic speed and murky darkness that could be acceptable to a number of non-melodeath fans that took to the earlier, more occult themed death metal of the late 80s, as well as a handful of Helloween and Iron Maiden fans who don't mind down-tuned guitars and non-tonal vocal sounds.\n\nWhile there is a very clear consistency that dominates this fairly streamlined, song oriented debut, \"Black Earth\" has a very obvious duality that comes of as very abrupt in a number of ways. In much the same respect as the transitional nature of At The Gates' early work, the 80s heavy and power metal inspired melodies almost act like occasional gimmicks to either highlight a differing approach to what largely comes off as fairly standard death metal, or perhaps even instrumental place markers between a darker riff assault that tends to accompany the vocal sections. Unlike In Flames and Dark Tranquillity, when hearing the bludgeoning fury of \"Bury Me An Angel\" and \"Transmigration Macabre\" the picture is more along the lines of a death/thrash assault with occasional melodic interludes that is a bit more reminiscent of the sound characterizing The Crown after they changed their name from Crown Of Thorns.\n\nPerhaps even more noticeable than the more traditional thrashing character of the riff set is the rest of the arrangement. While the battery of the percussion work here is pretty ferocious, it comes alongside a lead guitar assault and vocal lead that is very streamlined and, at times formulaic. The solo work on \"Fields Of Desolation\", which as a song tends to veer the closest to the power metal character sound that this style tends to get lumped in with, showcases a fairly reserved and almost singing lead guitar character reminiscent of a traditional baroque tune. Pile on top of this a vocal display out of Johan Liiva that is fairly similar to the largely deep sounding bark Chuck Schuldiner put forth on \"Human\", and this song (and much of this album for that matter) creates its own little world of symbiotic extremes, all fitting nicely into an equilibrium of aggression and sorrow that is largely missing from the current melodeath scene.\n\nWhile \"Stigmata\" is a slightly stronger album, both that album and this one are prime rib for any carnivorous consumer of melodic tinged death metal where the punch has not been sacrificed for the sake of wider appeal. The stereotypical Maiden-like melodic hooks are present and at time really abrupt, but this is an album defined more by a blistering kick to the gut than an appeal to metal's softer side. It could almost be passed off as a product of its time, if not a slight throwback in that it tends closer to the older death metal style than most other bands of a similar persuasion, particularly the often mentioned and sometimes derided Gothenburg trio. Think of it as what Carcass would have sounded like if they put out one more album after \"Heartwork\" and invited members of The Crown and In Flames to help out with the songwriting.\n",
        "\nThe early years of Arch Enemy are an interesting affair, in no small part because the true orthodoxy of melodeath had yet to establish itself. Amongst the Gothenburg crowd, the end of At The Gates came about and the subsequent stylistic metamorphosis of In Flames and Dark Tranquillity were starting to go underway, though they still retained much of their strength. Some of the more mainstream friendly outfits such as Amon Amarth were just getting started and not quite settled into their respective niches yet, and the whole folk infused melodic death/black metal craze was still a twinkle in the eyes of the likes of Windir and Suidakra. In keeping with all of this, the output of Michael Amott's new creation didn't have a stylistic trend to conform itself to, thus it largely falls back on a reliance to older conventions with a somewhat newer interpretation.\n\n\"Stigmata\" can be seen as a throwback to the early 90s in some respects, carrying a good helping of the dark yet consonant elements of \"Human\" and \"Individual Thought Patterns\", the thrashing nastiness of \"Blessed Are The Sick\", merged together with a melodic sensibility that is very much similar to the archaic, repetitive conventions of later 80s and early 90s Iron Maiden. Perhaps the biggest thing that keeps this album anchored firmly in a sense of olden aggression is the thick yet solid guitar sound, which is down-tuned to the levels of latter day Slayer, and with chunky speed riffs to boot. Along for the ride is the usual barrage of impressive lead guitar gymnastics, but presented in a way that is not quite as overtly neo-classical, but more of a merging of the wild shredding of Cannibal Corpse and the traditionally rock oriented character of the Smith vs. Murray duels heard on \"Piece Of Mind\" and \"Powerslave\".\n\nThese are the sort of songs that most fans of older death metal can probably get into, even with all the lighter melodic lead passages that remind more of 1986 than 1998. The lead off song \"Beast Of Man\" and the equally fast yet catchy \"Sinister Mephisto\" showcase an intricate merging of heavier mid-paced poundage with the older, fast paced death/thrash character that was done all but to a fault on \"Scream Bloody Gore\". \"Dark Of The Sun\" proves to be among the more menacing and evil sounding monsters to come out of the melodeath strain, resembling mid-90s Morbid Angel almost as much as it does In Flames, trading back and forth between a sorrowful melodic instrumental section and a gut-crushing stomp that sounds like something heard off of \"Domination\". But the ultimate highlight of this evenly built piece of raging darkness is \"Black Earth\", which hearkens back the closest to the extreme conventions that are often avoided in this genre, being heavy enough for Obituary yet with enough of a catchy pull to it to rope in the rank and file In Flames fan.\n\nWhile not quite the greatest thing to ever come out of the Swedish death scene, this is a pretty solid contender amongst even the less melodic, old school releases that are often the recipients of high praise amongst the purists. One of the major draws, and one that the band ended up parting ways with in favor of something that pushed them a bit further into conformity with the crowd, is Johan Liiva's mad dog barks. He's more in line with the conventional death metal grunt of the early 90s before Lord Worm and Chris Barnes started mixing in higher pitched shrieks, and also before a slight influence from the neighboring black metal scene began to inject an even higher pitched and more garbled take on screaming to the mix. While stylistically this takes some nods from the Gothenburg trio, vocally it's a lot closer to a number of Florida outfits, and thus comes an interesting blend of old and new that usually makes transitional albums all the more interesting. \"Stigmata\" is definitely an album with strong crossover appeal, and even the die-hard late 80s death metal cultists should give this album the once over.\n",
        "\nThe earlier days of Arch Enemy are a curiosity of sorts, inspiring a strong devotion amongst older school melodeath and death metal fans, and even roping in some outside of the general paradigm. At first glance, one might assume the preference for the period over the Gossow era to be merely a vocal one in the alleged chauvinistic tendencies that the extreme metal scene is often alleged to carry. However, a thorough parsing of the radical difference in overall sound reveals that with maybe the exception of the soon to follow \u201cWages Of Sin\u201d, this is all but an entirely different band, exuding a character more in line with the archaic irreverence and socially conscious traits of the earlier 1990s.\n\n\u201cBurning Bridges\u201d has been likened to a continuation of the spirit of what Michael Amott was bringing to the latter day Carcass sound (along with the two preceding albums). While there is a bit to this, the overall sound of this album actually points a bit more towards the \u201cSymbolic\u201d era of Death, though accented with some of the melodic contours in line with In Flames. The pacing is along the lines of a mostly up tempo thrash album with a somewhat depressive atmospheric veil, particularly during the vocal sections when riff layering creates a shimmering atmosphere that lightens the otherwise heavy punch of the usual lower end riffing associated with straight line death metal.\n\nMuch like the later albums with Gossow, this era is heavily guitar oriented, maintaining the soloing showmanship that was generally associated with the style\u2019s thrash roots and avoiding the more recent trend of dumbing down the style. The Amott brothers prove quite apt at rivaling a number of progressive outfits with a variety of stylistic influences, sometimes embracing the wildly erratic character of Slayer, at others leaning towards a Petrucci sound that incorporates as much idiomatic melodic material as it does fluid shredding licks. A good example of this sense of contrast manifests in the mellow neo-classical interlude of \u201cDemonic Science\u201d, which all but hearkens to something heard on an early 90s Helloween album and is among a few of the quirkier moments on here.\n\nVocalist Johan Liiva, whom the band soon ejected for allegedly not getting the job done behind the microphone, is something of an outlier when measured against other bands that have embraced the Gothenburg sound. He\u2019s more in line with a mid-80s Teutonic thrash vocalist mixed with a less guttural John Tardy than anything else, at times almost sounding like he\u2019s actually singing. It brings a more old school feel to the overall arrangement, morphing faster songs like \u201cThe Immortal\u201d and \u201cAngel Claw\u201d into something not all that far removed from a Kreator song mixed with a tiny hint of Iron Maiden during the brief instrumental passes, and on the lone doom-infused title song \u201cBurning Bridges\u201d almost hits upon the early death/doom sound of the early 90s.\n\nUltimately, what makes this album unique also proves to be a slight Achilles heel of sorts. It\u2019s clear that while the overall air of this is pretty conservative, there is a clear effort at versatility that makes for a few odd, out of place moments (particularly on \u201cDemonic Science\u201d). But this is definitely on the more essential side of the equation, particularly when measured against the bulk of many contemporary melodeath offerings. It manages to be catchy and also nasty enough to remind of what originally shocked the masses when death metal was first born, which is an impressive middle ground to accomplish for a style that is often dismissed as too mainstream for the truer wings of metal\u2019s true believers.\n",
        "\nThere are some bands that have stuck fairly close to the original death metal template, to the point that they are frequently accused of releasing virtually the same album over and over (some have levied this charge at Cannibal Corpse), but what is that original template anyway? Is it the just shy of thrash metal, all fast all the time character of the early Death albums spearheaded by a toneless grunt in Chuck Schuldiner rather than a tonal yet often limited shouter? Or is it the albums of the early 90s where things were slightly progressive in character, of which Death is also a major player? Which ever case may be, the advent of the Gothenburg melodeath trifecta and its affiliates brought in a somewhat different answer, so much so that some dismiss the style as being something other than death metal.\n\nArch Enemy, a project that rose out of the demise of Carcass, conformed fairly closely to the mid 90s Gothenburg paradigm. It took on an almost power metal character meshed with an archaic nod to the formulaic, fast and heavily Slayer infused early Death albums in \"Scream Bloody Gore\" and \"Leprosy\", while also bringing in an equally fierce lead guitar barrage via the Amott brothers, who are equal, if not somewhat superior in their ability to cut heads to Schuldiner and his various co-axe wielders. In fact, the principle thing that excluded this band from being a full out Gothenburg cliche was the less sepulchral, more hardcore oriented shouts of Johan Liiva, a vocal character bearing more similarity to early Possessed or Kreator than any of the seminal Florida or Swedish death metal vocalists of note. With his exodus and the entry of the auspicious person of Angela Gossow came something closer to the nasty, quasi-blackened character embodied in Dark Tranquillity and At The Gates.\n\n\"Wages Of Sin\" could be likened to better version of the last couple of In Flames albums before their stylistic departure a year after this came out, and with a more competent screamer. Yet at the same time, it's a bit faster and closer to the thrashing character of more aggressive acts that still manage to be melodic. It's nestled somewhere between the chaotic rage of \"Deathrace King\" and the somber agony of \"Clayman\", all the while outclassing both in the guitar shredding department to the point of rivaling Dream Theater. A few listens to \"Enemy Within\", \"Ravenous\" and \"The First Deadly Sin\" showcases a brilliant merging of darkness, melodic contour, and aggression that is worthy of any extreme metal's attention, yet also not wholly beyond the realm of someone who doesn't normally venture beyond the level of extremity put forth on a standard Amon Amarth album. There also seems to be a slight nod to Iced Earth nestled at the beginning of the album (which sounds fairly similar to the intro of \"Burnt Offerings\") and the brief melodic serenade \"Snow Bound\" which conjures up images of a slightly less agitated Malmsteen ballad/instrumental.\n\nThe superiority of this album to subsequent works with Angela Gossow at the helm is mostly a result of this still having one foot firmly placed in the older side of the Gothenburg equation where the modern rock presence was minimal and the aesthetic was a bit colder and otherworldly. The production is a bit choppy, in part due to the clicking bass drum clashing somewhat with the heavier, bass heavy guitar tone. It's almost to the point that despite Gossow's presence, this album is more in the realm of the 3 with Liiva at the helm. Anyone with a taste for the 90s Gothenburg scene should like this, though it does have a bit of crossover appeal to harder edged listeners who want a harder stomp and less pomp.\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s been some contention as to which outfit is the most consequential in the Swedish melodeath scene, particularly given the incremental embracement of a sort of modern rock infusion that has drastically changed the character of the sound. All roads would seem to lead to In Flames in this regard, in particular their much scorned change in form \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d, which sounded almost as metalcore as it did melodeath. But for some reason the accusatory fingers often find their way to the Angela Gossow era of Arch Enemy, particularly the stuff preceding the commercially successful \u201cRise Of The Tyrant\u201d. Stylistically these does not really follow, given that Gossow\u2019s very orthodox death bark, while produced by a female, is far closer to the late 80s death metal standard than anything Anders Frid\u00e9n has blurted into a microphone before 2002, let alone afterward, and the music has largely remained in the style typical of the later 90s despite a few modern rock additives.\n\nFor the most part, \u201cAnthems Of Rebellion\u201d follows the tried but true, often good yet sometimes lacking approach that tends to typify most late 90s melodeath offerings. There are a handful of blistering speed/thrash oriented masterpieces that steal the show, some fairly decent mid-tempo material that plays with the atmosphere a bit, but also some rock/groove infected clunkers that don\u2019t quite inspire the sense of irreverent fury that is being sought after. While songs such as \u201cSilent Wars\u201d, \u201cDespicable Heroes\u201d and \u201cSaints And Sinners\u201d are the obligatory triumphs of the style where the riffs are busy, the solos flashy and expressive, and the vocal display ugly yet near digitally precise, they are the exception rather than the rule, in contrast to the constant fury of Skyfire\u2019s \u201cTimeless Departure\u201d or C.O.B.\u2019s \u201cHatebreeder\u201d, which remain spellbinding examples of how this style can slay when it has to.\n\nThe bulk of the contents found on here, aside from the aforementioned classics of technical brilliance with a catchy streak, are a bit of a mixed bag. \u201cDehumanization\u201d isn\u2019t a bad number for a song that sounds pretty heavily influenced by Pantera and a couple other 90s groove outfits, but it sounds out of place alongside the rest of this album, particularly when that comical clean vocal chorus chimes in. \u201cExist To Exit\u201d and \u201cWe Will Rise\u201d sort of plod around a bit and bring on the clich\u00e9 modern rock elements, the former taking a good bit of time to get going for a 5 minute radio-friendly number. Having said that, most of what is on here that doesn\u2019t outright slay tends to come off more as average than bad, with perhaps the lone exception of \u201cInstinct\u201d, a song that actually starts off pretty solid and chunky but lands in a horrid chorus that almost sounds like it was plagiarized from a pop/punk band and then had a few dissonant sounding chords thrown in to make it sound quasi-menacing, and failing in the process.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely understandable that this album eventually paved the way for the weak and heavily derided \u201cDoomsday Machine\u201d, as it clearly shows a tendency towards incorporating a number of contemporary rock elements and dressing them up with a heavier guitar tone, faster beats, and an ugly sounding growl. But there are a fair share of redeeming factors here, not the least of them being the wildly technical and almost operatic character of the Amott brothers\u2019 lead guitar passages. Melodeath, particularly the Swedish end, doesn\u2019t often carry guitarists that can cut heads as fierce as these two do, and it is definitely a treat for the ears if that is what one is drawn to. It\u2019s a decent pick up, though it\u2019s among the weaker offerings out of this band as a whole, and also with regards to the latter era with Angela Gossow out front.\n",
        "\nMy excursion into the world of Arch Enemy has brought me to a rather surprising revelation. Evidently, the 2004-2005 slumps that hit a number of my favorite power metal bands was not unique to that part of the metal scene alone, but also hit a number of established melodeath and a handful of folk bands as well. The same sort of \u201cwhere the hell is this coming from\u201d moments just ooze out of this very confused album that boasts itself of being some sort of \u201cDoomsday Machine\u201d. Somewhere between the tried and true format that this band has been going by since the mid 90s of archaic melodic metal influences spliced with a heavier guitar sound and a pissed off guttural bark reminiscent of Chuck Schuldiner and John Tardy, something got lost in the translation.\n\nThe two primary albums that come to mind when listening to this are Amon Amarth\u2019s \u201cFate Of Norns\u201d and Suidakra\u2019s \u201cCommand To Charge\u201d, both of which express a similar sense of hesitation and lack of fulfillment. A good amount of pop/rock influences that are more in line with the recent output of In Flames also comes into the equation, particularly with the plodding \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d and the sloppy, semi-fast, full of fits and starts mess that is \u201cTaking Back My Soul\u201d. At times it\u2019s difficult to tell whether the Amott brothers were trying a little too hard, or not hard enough, in large part because one song will sound over-developed or unnecessarily varied while the next will come off as dumbed down. This is actually not a terribly uncommon thing when a band tries to pander to a wider audience while trying to hold on to its base, and more often than not it fails in the latter while sometimes also in the former.\n\nHowever, unlike the somewhat infamous Suidakra flop mentioned previously, this is still something that can be identified with the band that put it together. There are even a couple of fairly bright spots on this somewhat uneven album, such as the chunky thrasher with lots of detailing \u201cSkeleton Dance\u201d, which keeps from resorting to too many contradictory ideas and does well to avoid having Angela Gossow exaggerate her vocals to the point of sounding like Anders Frid\u00e9n\u2019s whinier modern character. \u201cI Am Legend/Out For Blood\u201d also kicks up the overdrive something fierce and pummels the ears with some punchy thrashing riff work. There\u2019s also the usual barrage of technical soloing courtesy of the Amott brothers, even on the less than stellar songs. It\u2019s too bad, but unfortunately metal does not live by solos alone, otherwise this band would have a perfect discography.\n\nMost of what I know about Arch Enemy thus far is contained to the current incarnation, and of it, I\u2019d argue this is the weakest of the Gossow era, and probably the weakest of anything that Michael Amott has ever put his name to. The best way to describe it as a book that continually builds up a certain character as being important, and then just suddenly kills it off for no reason whatsoever, leaving the reader more pissed off at the author for wasting his/her time than anything else. However, this is the sort of album that has a handful of songs that can be qualified as obligatory, but the rest is very skip worthy. It would be a bargain at $5, and highway robbery at pretty much any price above that.\n",
        "\nAs my continuing education in the well known subject of melodeath proceeds, along with it comes my perplexity at its polarizing nature. In many respects it comes off as an eclectic blend of modern power and thrash metal conventions with a hint of the archaic early 90s death metal scene before brutality began to reign supreme. Perhaps that is the problem, the lack of brutality, as Sweden\u2019s contribution to this style has largely gone the way of near pop/rock simplicity. My new found interest in Arch Enemy, perhaps among the better known in this business alongside Amon Amarth, bucks this trend in some respects, while providing a much needed technical edge to it that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\nLargely hailed as a comeback album after the perceived failure that was \u201cDoomsday Machine\u201d, \u201cRise Of The Tyrant\u201d actually saw this outfit come into some mainstream success. This might be confusing to those who associate the Billboard Top 200 with Nickelback and Breaking Benjamin, but given the similar success of Behemoth, it\u2019s far from unheard of. Arch Enemy is not at all inaccessible here when it comes to mainstream ears, particularly when considering the heavily rock infused \u201cRevolution Begins\u201d, the mid-tempo single hit that enjoyed regular play on Headbangers Ball, as well as the equally simple and restrained \u201cI Will Live Again\u201d. Either one of the aforementioned songs could just as easily rope in anyone who took to Children Of Bodom or In Flames back in their formative days.\n\nNevertheless, the charm of this band is found principally in their ability to balance aggression, catchiness, and virtuosity into a nice, tight package that can play to anyone who wants to hear something that\u2019s animated yet not over-the-top. Keyboards are used sparingly, Gossow\u2019s manly barks get the job done but are mostly one dimensional, but the riff work on here is fairly fancy, as is the lead breaks. Between the riveting solos that paint the frenetic bruisers that are \u201cIn This Shallow Grave\u201d and \u201cBlood On Your Hands\u201d, as well as the smooth melodic candor of the neo-classical instrumental \u201cIntermezzo Liberte\u201d, a fair amount of Malmsteen and Kerry King influences shine through. Similarly, the largely modern sounding thrasher with a progressive edge \u201cThe Great Darkness\u201d manages to throw in a couple 18th century musical clich\u00e9s as a nod to the 80s Swedish icon that brought Bach to the metal scene.\n\nThis comes just a few inches short of finding itself in kickass territory, but this is actually a solid album considering that it coincides with a fairly massive dry spell in the Swedish death scene circa 2007. Not everything that hits pay dirt in the commercial realm deserves to be trashed, though that probably won\u2019t stop the usual suspects from dismissing it on such grounds. If one can remember a time when In Flames and Dark Tranquillity made an effort at being animated, or when Alexi Laiho wasn\u2019t infusing his vocal work with gimpy metalcore tendencies, this will prove to be a worthwhile reminder, though the sentimentality is accompanied by an updated sound that may come off as less than organic.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy, despite their obvious popularity and media exposure, are a band that I have remained somewhat ignorant of. One might chalk it up to just being a depressing oddball who only likes music that he discovered on his own, but my lack of interest in televised metal bands and particularly, Swedish melodeath outfits, has sort of left me at a loss with this scene to an extent. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m really hostile to the style, but just one of those quirky things where I just never really got around to it until recently. As such, despite my familiarity with Carcass, \u201cKhaos Legions\u201d is actually my first experience in dealing with this band, which according to some might be the equivalent of me discovering Dimmu Borgir through \u201cIn Sorte Diaboli\u201d.\n\nSuffice to say, this is a decent album that definitely moderates the aggression and catchiness factors into a nifty little, modernly tweaked package. Probably the only thing that separates this from In Flames during the \u201cColony\u201d to \u201cClayman\u201d era is a slightly stronger vocal job and a better technical display out of all members in congress. The overall melodic scheme of these songs isn\u2019t out of line with some conventions first pushed by a handful of power metal bands on the heavier side of the equation, and occasionally there are parallels with some middle era works out of fellow Swedes Nocturnal Rites and Heed, right down to the tasteful keyboard elements and wild lead guitar elements, as unapologetically displayed on \u201cThorns In My Flesh\u201d and \u201cCity Of The Dead\u201d, which are among the stronger songs on a fairly evenly tempered expression of angst.\n\nPerhaps a little bit more surprising, at least given my own experience with the lighter side of Gothenburg\u2019s scene, is the overt thrash tendencies that interweave with the slowed down melodic and groove based passages, particularly in the cases of \u201cVengeance Is Mine\u201d and \u201cBloodstained Cross\u201d. Between the frenetic and highly virtuosic solos and the busy riff work, it\u2019s hard to resist throwing the horns occasionally. The biggest pitfall of these songs is that often things will slow down just a little too frequently, to the point of making half the song a breakdown, resulting in a listening experience that\u2019s a bit disjointed at times. Part of it may be the tenets of the style, which calls for frequent slow passages with a denser atmosphere, but here it works against the overt speed/thrash elements.\n\nBasically, this comes off as a slightly faster version of the Gothenburg craze, particularly during the late 90s. The vocals are fairly one dimensional, though the fact that Angela Gossow is a woman might shock first time listeners given her work on here sounds manlier than Anders Frid\u00e9n and Mikael Stanne combined, but the music picks up on any slack on her end of things. At times this sounds a little bit pretty and consonant for something that tends to be obsessed with chaos and suffering, but that tends to be the dilemma for most in this style. This will probably sit well with most fans of the genre, though any crossover appeal will probably be limited to power metal fans who don\u2019t find the toneless shouting vocal aesthetic unbearable, ergo those who already listen to bands like Children Of Bodom and Kalmah.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy have always been a band I've enjoyed, and they were - along with Carcass - instrumental to my wanderings into the more extreme side of the metal spectrum. I especially enjoyed the band when Johan Liiva was unleashing his furious, neurotic vocal style. In fact I'd say he was amongst my favorite death metal vocalists, as the way he conveys emotion throughout his tormented barks really strikes a chord with me, and comes off excellent. \n\nThe earlier Arch Enemy material often felt to me like the spiritual successor to the work Carcass laid down on Heartwork, (and okay, I guess Wages of Sin had one or two moments which would bring Carcass to mind). This of course would spring from the guitar approach of the Amott brothers, particularly Mike, who I feel did a lot in helping shape Swedish death metal in general. Their approach to melody and harmony is about as identifiably Scandinavian as it comes, with that decidedly home-grown style of down-tuned Maiden harmonies which again was one of the hallmarks of Heartwork. \n\nHere Arch Enemy were right on the cusp of becoming the power metal band on steroids that recorded Wages Of Sin, fortunately they still had their balls firmly intact (no pun intended what-so-ever), although this is definitely the cut off point in the band's discography, heralded by both the coming stylistic change and change in vocalist. Here though, the band could still tear heads like their leaner, meaner brothers in Stockholm. As I've said before, this album is fairly reminiscent of Heartwork, though light years away from being a carbon clone. Tracks such as \"The Immortal\" and \"Angel Claw\" display this notion quite well quite well. \n\n\"Dead Inside\" is about the most atypical Arch Enemy number here, and especially at this particular point in their career signposts their stlye perfecty. Certainly one of the bands finer numbers. \"Seed of Hate\" sees the band treading the waters of eighties metal worship, with a definite \"Bark at the Moon\" vibe going on. Without a doubt an enjoyable track, although just like \"Dead Inside\" would signpost Arch Enemy at the time of recording, \"Seed of Hate\" stands as somewhat an indicator to the future. Those looking for some of the aforementioned head tearing should look towards \"Silverwing\" and \"Demonic Science\" which deliver some serious Swedish style death metal chops. \n\nI tend think Burning Bridges is the finest of the Arch Enemy offerings, and would definitely say that this was one of the stronger releases to come from the oft maligned Gothenburg crowd. The band didn't put a foot wrong here, and if there was any Arch Enemy album you should hear once my vote would go to this. \n\nEdited 24/11/13 to actually make sense.\n",
        "\nThis one takes me back to being around sixteen. Wages of Sin tends to be the favorite where the majority are concerned with the Arch Enemy back catalogue. After Johan Liiva parting ways with the Amott's and co, the band hired femme fatale Angela Gossow, who sparked the whole \"fucking hell, no way is that a lass singing\" thing.\n\nWhile I will always prefer Johan's stylings, Angela was hardly a bad choice and her vocals are a venomous, vitriolic growl, that without prior knowledge probably could fool anyone regarding gender. Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m's production gave the band a much bigger, clearer production and as a result Wages of Sin was Arch Enemy's most modern sounding release (at the time). \n\nThe album is packed with clicking double kick drums, and heavy yet glossed guitars. When compared with the bands previous opus, Wages of Sin sounds like a macho power metal album. \"Enemy Within\" kicks in with an open string lead guitar line, before exploding into low end thumping. Everything the would characterize the second half of Arch Enemy's career can be found here. \"Burning Angel\" is one of the bands finer numbers, and again has quite a bit in common with the power metal style, Michael Amott's wah pedal infested guitar leads are out in force here. Fan favorite \"Ravenous\" established the blazing double kicking Arch Enemy track, this set a formula that the band would utilize on just about every post Wages of Sin release. Furious speed for two verses, broken up with a Chris Amott trem abusing pyrotechnical break, melodic chorus, rinse repeat, intense guitar solo - you know the score. \n\nThe latter half of the album is a little heavier, introduced via the post thrash stylings of \"Dead Bury their Dead\". \"The First Deadly Sin\" and \"Web of Lies\" are two of the bands more furious odes, with the former having some great guitar work. Wages of Sin isn't without its share of duds though, the almost Nu-metal edge to \"Behind the Smile\" is an entirely skippable affair, and \"Savage Messiah\" stands as a poor mans version of the closing dirge of the previous albums title track. \n\nFortunately the band unleash maybe the albums finest track at the end, \"Shadows and Dust\" is Arch Enemy at their finest, with great yet simplistic riffs and some quality themes. All in all Wages of Sin is a quality yet somewhat uneven release. The killer here really does fucking kill, and the album houses some of Arch Enemy's finest tracks. However the filler blows, and as a result I rarely spin this album in its entirety. Wages of Sin is a noteworthy release in both Arch Enemy's career, and of course the whole Gothenburg scene. A flawed modern classic at best.\n",
        "\n'Stigmata' is the classic example of how melodic death metal should sound: Two and half steps down tuned guitars, melodic oriented riffs without loosing any death metal elements, beastly growls, sharp rhythm section, heavy production and diverse song structures. In 1998 the melodic death metal movement was beyond his glory days: 'At The Gates' disbanded after a quartet of well known classics, 'In Flames' began to lose their creativity and turned to a commercial type of songwriting and so was 'Dark Tranquillity'. 'Arch Enemy' deteriorated artistically over the years as well, but in 1998 they released a honest piece of melodic death metal that makes their 00's albums looks ridiculous and overly commercial.\n\n'Beast Of Man' is a great opening track. There are many fast tremolo picked riffs and blast beating drums that showcase the nature of this album pretty well: 'Stigmata' is an album that always search for melodic theme but doesn't compromise on brutality for a sole moment. 'Johan Liiva' appears to be an outstanding vocalist: his growl is not too guttural, he sounds quite humane but still maintain a harsh timbre without harming the pronunciation of the lyrics. The title track is a short two minutes instrumental that exhibit the Amott brothers guitar skills very well. Highly technical yet melodic guitar harmonies will sweep your ear and will leave you hypnotized until the next song begin. 'Sinister Mephisto' is the best track here in my opinion. It has a well developing structure and tons of heavy riffs and superior drumming. The chorus is catchy as hell with it's harmonized dual guitars and plain vocals and there are more shred guitar to be found here in the C-part of this song. \n\nAnother highlight of this album is 'Let the Killing Begin'. There are some mean guitar riffs to be found here plus very technical and aggressive drumming that will force you to head bang till your neck break. The chorus remind me a bit of 'Bury Me an Angel ' from their debut album, but it's still a superb melodic and heavy one that bring the catchiness level of this song some levels up. Rest of the tracks in this album lack a bit of the sharpness the former tracks had, but these are still a collection of decent melodic death metal that is well written and accurately performed.\n\nOverall, this is a very enjoyable record. Michael and Christopher amott are quite talented guitar players and proved an amazing writing skills in 'Stigmata' with tons of topnotch guitar riffs and leads. Get this album if you aren't familiar with Arch Enemy's old school catalog, you'll be surprised to find a way more creative and quality band from the one that is active nowadays.\n",
        "\nBy far, Arch Enemy's first 3 releases in my opinion are their best. This is the only album by the band where I can tolerate Angela Gossow's vocal outputs. Johan Liiva, their previous vocalist, was for the most part, the most well suited for the band. His voice didn't drown out the melodic guitar riffs. He was supposedly kicked out of the band for failing to perform well during Arch Enemy's live performances. Damn shame.\n\nThe opening features soft piano bits which then segues into the band's march of awesome melodic death metal. There are so many riffs that really stand out here, but some clean guitar that I didn't think too highly of. The music throughout the album is filled with bits of melodies which are stunning and captivating. What caught me the most was track 2 entitled \"Burning Angel.\"\n\nAngela's hoarse throat on here is still annoying, but less so then more recent releases. On here, she doesn't use many vocal effects to block out the Amott's keen guitar. Her voice is hoarse, but not so hoarse that you can't hear the music. It's very difficult to have the band relying on her as the lead vocalist. As I've previously mentioned, her voice bothers the hell out of me.\n\nThere are many segments of music on here that is quite original and sticks to you, as \"Burning Angel\" does for me. A good follow up from \"Burning Bridges\", but not as worthy as that album is for me. I'd say for most of the album with exceptions didn't impact me very much mainly because of the vocals and a lot of the guitars are just aren't as good.\n\nA lot of the wah-pedal was used by Michael Amott and was good on some songs, but I think that he used it a little bit too much. Christopher Amott's leads aren't as striking as on previous albums. I think that most of the riffs are good, however, they could've been better than they actually were on here. The guitars could've meshed better with Angela's throat. I don't think that they put in enough time to weave in the guitars with the voice.\n\nAs far as the production goes, I'd say that all of the instruments were well mixed in together to the point to where you can hear everything. The bass guitar could've been a bit louder, but you still can hear it some. Angela's vocals aren't as loud on here, so you can still hear the guitars. I'd say that the guitars could've been a bit chunkier like on \"Stigmata.\"\n\nThis release is a good output and worth getting. I've waived out some things that needed to be discussed discreetly so you know what to expect. To me, the last good Arch Enemy release definitely legitimately investing in. The guitars are the highlights as always, but Angela really doesn't fit the band's melodic twists. Johan is deeply missed and the band isn't the same without him.\n",
        "\nIn the main, artistic responses to the financial crash of 2008 and its political implications have been disappointing so far. In music, generally only artists who were already 'political' have been able to interpret this new age of struggle with any degree of success. From my MP3 collection I'm thinking of Muse, Max Cavalera's projects, Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine, Kreator, Killing Joke, Fear Factory, and various rappers. This was to be expected, as it must necessarily take the emergence of a new working class movement to pose the questions which need to be answered by artists in the near future, or else everything is inward-looking resignation and self-pity.\n\nHowever, the initial stirrings of the 'Arab Spring' coincided with melodic death metal band Arch Enemy's retreat into the Sweet Spot Studio in Halmstad, Sweden for the recording of Khaos Legions. In promoting the album, vocalist Angela Gossow told interviewers that the band - and her in particular - had been inspired by what was happening in Tunisia, Egypt, and so many other countries. The artwork was modelled on Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's French revolution-era Liberty Leading the People, and Gossow clearly sees herself as symbolically being on the front line, roaring the rest of us towards freedom.\n\nCologne-born Gossow joined Sweden-based Arch Enemy in 2000, after they had recorded three decent but unspectacular albums with Johan Liiva. The ferocious intensity of her growl far eclipsed Liiva, and her fiery, passionate belief in anarchism started to inform many of the band's songs. At times this verged on a kind of punkish ultra-leftism, especially on 2003's Anthems Of Rebellion, which was very much concerned with individual change against a background of general conformity. As time has gone on and conditions have changed, her politics have matured, to reflect a greater collectivity. In that time, the band have specialised in fist pounding adrenaline rushes, often punctuated by soaring, transcendent, almost singalong lead guitar solos, but struggled to pull off a great album. This continuing process is evident on Khaos Legions. There's plenty of killer, but there's still too much filler.\n\nThe opening few tracks are absolutely storming. Riffing, police sirens and crowd noises build to a crescendo, before an impossibly strange male voice warns us that \"From the ashes of a corrupt and dying world, they rise like a phoenix, a godless entity: they are the chaos legions.\" We're then straight into the first single, Yesterday Is Dead And Gone, with its wailing guitars, strident drums, and the pledge that \"This is our reckoning day\", in case you hadn't realised it already.\n\nAs you might expect, Bloodstained Cross is an inditement of religion's effect on human consciousness, and the urgent need to \"Get off your praying knees\" because \"Armageddon is drawing near\", and \"All the prayers in this world won't help you now\". The symbolic standard of anarchism is invoked on Under Black Flags We March. Against a pounding martial rhythm, Gossow shrieks that \"Empires of corruption will fall\", because \"The more we have to suffer, the more we will fight\".\n\nTowards the middle, City Of The Dead and Through The Eyes Of A Raven are more brilliant bundles of fury. The former seems to be a portrait of ghetto life, \"where the nameless live and breathe\" amidst \"misery, frustration, anger, depression\" and \"monuments of death\". The latter gives each band member a moment to shine in an epic tale of war and paradise lost.\n\nPrecisely at the moment where the wonderful acoustic outro to Through The Eyes Of A Raven ends, the album stumbles badly. From this point on, Khaos Legions is hit and miss. Moralistic animal rights song Cruelty Without Beauty has little to recommend it. Thorns In My Flesh might lyrically be an attack on the self interested behaviour of the rich and powerful, but vocally and musically it feels like the punches are pulled. And Secrets is an extremely poor choice of album closer, because it sounds like a reject cut from 2001's Wages Of Sin. But Cult Of Chaos is good enough fight song, urging revolution as the next stage of evolution, and the Amott brothers pull off some very nice guitar work on instrumentals We Are A Godless Entity and Turn To Dust.\n\nReturning to my introduction, Khaos Legions comes quite close to successfully interpreting this \"new age of struggle\". At certain times, it approaches perfection, and could be a superb soundtrack for Tahrir Square demonstrations or garment workers combating police on Sri Lankan picket lines. At others, it sounds samey, and recycles some of the band's less than glorious moments. I think Arch Enemy are yet to come up with their defining album, but then Gossow and company should find plenty of inspiration in the months and years ahead. For already extreme artists, there is a substantial challenge posed by the reigniting class war - how do you get even more extreme to mirror changes in society, yet have elements of light and shade?\n",
        "\nIt has been a long, long time since I have written a review, and there are several reasons for this. Firstly, I have been insanely busy with finishing college and getting work as a theatre electrician. Secondly, I have been trying to broaden my musical palette; I have been listening to things from the 50s and 60s, as well as plenty of drum and bass and electronic music, because I enjoy it and for the sake of variety. And lastly, I haven\u2019t written a review in a while because I knew that I would have to shake away the rust by reviewing an album such as this, \u2018Khaos Legions\u2019.\n\nI am not writing this review because it is an easy one to write, or using this as a warm up review for the torrent of fury I plan to one day unleash on Morbid Angel\u2019s recent effort, or the (eventual) praise I intend to bestow Skinless\u2019 \u2018Trample The Weak, Hurdle The Dead\u2019. This review will actually be quite difficult, because I genuinely don\u2019t know how to re-hash the same material in the same way as they re-hash theirs, but yet that is all this album deserves, as the few of you who can still be bothered to offer Arch Enemy as much as a withering look will know by now.\n\nIn fact, I am almost wasting my time here, you could write this review for yourself. The cheesy, heavy-poppy harmonies are still there, delivered with such little drive or direction that they are only able to draw contemptuous glances from a now bored and indifferent audience. The drums, once the heartbeat of this project, are now pedestrian exercises in predictability and general average-ness, content to sit there and just BE on the record, apparently for no reason other than a metal band needs a drummer and so one has been provided. No creativeness is on offer here; the no-more-than-token blastbeat fails to administer any sort of adrenaline rush on \u2018Cruelty Without Beauty\u2019, the attempt at quirkiness and diversity on songs like \u2018Through The Eyes Of A Raven\u2019 serves as nothing but inconsistency and directionless confusion.\n\nIncidentally, the lyrics on these songs actually have nigh-on fuck all to do with the song titles. Take \u2018Through The Eyes Of A Raven\u2019 as an example. Very narrow margins already of any sensible topic matter \u2013 perhaps you could work something in along the lines of, I don\u2019t know, about how the snow covered landscape in Winter always looks bleaker from the eyes of the animals that have to contend with nature\u2019s harshest and coldest conditions, or something. But what we have here is basically the equivalent of:\n\n\u201cI was really drunk last night\nI threw up lots and I pissed in the street\nI was looking at my hilarious reflection in a shop window\nOh \u2013 and there was a Raven watching me.\n\nI was walking through a wood once\nI heard a noise behind me and got scared\nSo I started running and didn\u2019t stop until I got home\nAnd this experience was made even more intense and grim because a Raven saw it.\u201d\n\nAngela, the ever-present weight tied to the ankles of this band as it slowly sinks to the bottom of a river somewhere, can\u2019t help but prove once again that she genuinely doesn\u2019t have any idea what\u2019s going on when it comes to writing lyrics. Lyrics may not be that important to some fans of metal, but as a band if you believe yourself to be the rallying cry for the revolution of the (presumably) downtrodden and weak against the (presumably) all powerful corporate behemoth, then you had better have something decent prepared for when people listen to you, rather than the insincere and irrelevant rubbish on songs like \u2018Under Black Flags We March\u2019 or \u2018Cult of Chaos\u2019.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to say about the Amott brothers. They know they can do better than this, I mean they have ALREADY PROVEN that they can. The song writing is lazy and uncreative, every riff is a carbon copy of something either on the very same record or a previous one, the solos whizz by unable to repair any of the damage\u2026it simply doesn\u2019t make the cut anymore. As is normal on an Arch Enemy album, some things catch the ear; the occasional riff here, the odd guitar lick there, but not nearly often enough to warrant much merit at all. Later Arch Enemy albums are more centred round the mid-paced, chuggier riffs with an occasional thrash riff thrown in like an unwanted freebie, and that\u2019s exactly the formula followed here to the letter. God, has anything happened to this band since their last CD\u2026?\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t even resonate with the metal community generally, at all. This band is terrible, these songs are terrible, this album is terrible, as will be the next one, and the one after that, and the one after that, and the one after that\u2026 Because Arch Enemy isn\u2019t the type of band to know when to call it a day before all members lose the willpower to write something of worth. Devin Townsend had the guts to pull the plug on Strapping Young Lad before the steam ran out, the boys from Yyrkoon knew when to throw in the towel, as did Gorerotted, so why the FUCK can\u2019t Arch Enemy do the same and save me from writing reviews like this?\n",
        "\nThis legendary Swedish melodic death metal act needn't an introduction, especially since they're well established and have been for over 16 years. The lineup on this release features Johan Liiva on vocals, Michael Amott on guitars, Christopher Amott on guitars, Martin Bengtsson on bass, and Daniel Erlandsson on drums.\n\nThere is no intro just tremolo picked guitar riffs that give you the overall dark feel of the release. This album is filled with melodic overtures, B-tuned thick guitars, and Johan's distinctive low throat. The guitar riffs are entirely unique, imaginative, creative, melodic and quite memorable. This I believe to be the band's best output in their entire discography. It's too bad Johan isn't still on vocals.\n\nThe music is what's the most enduring. There's a combination of sweet distinct songs on this original sounding overall release. It features the band's unbelievably awesome writing capabilities. Songs such as \"Beast of Man\", \"Dark of the Sun\" and \"Bridge of Destiny\" feature such great catchy guitar bits. Christopher dominates on lead, while Michael overuses that wah-pedal. It would be ideal if Michael was solely on rhythm guitar.\n\nChristopher is way more technical than his brother on lead, but Michael still has some good melodic solos that compliment the album. That chunky guitar is what is most admirable. The bass guitar was hard to hear. It was barely audible during the entire album. That is where I think is the weakest point is on the album. Everything else blends well in it's entirety. Nothing else lagging behind except the bass.\n\nThis is an album where you can't really get sick of because it's simply intoxicating, especially if you're a melodic death freak like me. The leads, rhythms, vocals, and drums are perfectly executed without much discretion. There is nothing not to like here since the melodies shine so well here. Without a doubt, \"Stigmata\" reigns in its' entirety and remains to be the most ideal melodic death metal release that Arch Enemy has ever put out!\n",
        "\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the news that Arch Enemy were to re-record a mixture of tracks from their Johan Liiva-era albums, so as to have the unnatural vocals of Angela Gossow for newer fans (every time I hear her \u2018sing\u2019 I can\u2019t help but think that there\u2019s some poor guy out there somewhere with a woman\u2019s singing voice in some sort of cruel mix up of nature), as well as boosted production duties.\n\nThe reason for my uncertain thoughts were mainly because I actually became a fan of Arch Enemy upon the release of Burning Bridges (after hearing \u201cDemonic Science\u201d on a Terrorizer magazine compilation CD), thus worked my way backwards from there. I did enjoy Angela\u2019s first Arch Enemy album Wages of Sin (which I had to have imported from Japan at the time, as it didn\u2019t have a European release back then). However, I felt they lost it big time with Anthems of Rebellion and Doomsday Machine, only to slightly redeem themselves with Rise of the Tyrant.\n\nThus, to curb my ramblings, I was quite happy with the original versions and actually quite liked Liiva\u2019s vocals. Overall, I just didn\u2019t feel the need for any re-recordings \u2013 quite like many a Destruction and Anthrax fan would\u2019ve felt when they decided to re-record classic material too. Anyhow, having heard The Root of All Evil a good few times now, I can say it isn\u2019t actually too bad at all. The songs are all re-created pretty much identically to the originals, albeit to my ears, with a looser more organic sound to the guitars (the originals sounded like they\u2019d had the guitars overdubbed about a thousand times). One thing that has been overdubbed over and over in places are Angela\u2019s vocals, with varied screams overlapping each other to make her sound not only unhinged, but really quite inhuman at times too. There\u2019s a few little blink and you\u2019ll miss it changes to solos here and there, but nothing that really stands out as being incredibly different or outlandish when held up in comparison to the originals.\n\nApart from the vocals and slightly better production (c\u2019mon, lets face it \u2013 the original albums are only 10-15 years old anyway, their production wasn\u2019t exactly horrific in the first place), there\u2019s nothing more to mention really (bar a throwaway newly recorded intro track). As a bigger fan of older Arch Enemy material, I still prefer the originals and can\u2019t see what the big deal is with people disliking Liiva\u2019s original vocal work. But, Arch Enemy obviously saw it as a big enough deal to warrant this (or a big enough dollar sign/contractual obligation \u2013 one of the three).\n\nThus, if you really hated Liiva\u2019s vocal work, and can\u2019t live without Angela\u2019s manly vocal cords being massaged into every inch of Arch Enemy\u2019s catalogue, this will be mana from heaven for you \u2013 simply because the material IS that much better than the majority of Angela-era albums. The Root of All Evil is undoubtedly packed with the most excellent of Arch Enemy material, it just seems rather unnecessary. The material is more worthy than 56%, but this release is not.\n\nOriginally written for www.metalteamuk.net\n",
        "\nThis is, of course, is nothing groundbreaking, but that's not what we are looking for here, nor is it what we were expecting. We were expecting a good Gothenburg release and this is what we got!\n\nThe music is always quality melodic death metal led by the ferocious vocals of Angela. She sounds so vicious and it's awesome! The guitar work is a pounding attack brought to us by the Amott brothers. It has a razor sharp sound and the tone is perfect. The drum work is blistering with blast beats and fast fills building the backbone of the music. The bass is pretty much inaudible, which is not a good thing. The production values are perfect as expected. All in all, this release has its redeeming factors despite its errors. \n\nWhat are the errors, you ask? Lets talk about the. First of all, the bass. As stated before, I can't hear it. That's a big minus. Furthermore, I believe the drummer lacks energy. Then we have Angela. Yes, she is ferocious. Yes, she is vicious and sounds evil. She is amazing but sometimes I find her quite monotonous with a lack of variation subtracting from her overall performance. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I got tired of the whole melodeath scene. I don't know. It's just lacking something in my opinion. Also, I believe that she should not be excused because she is a woman. Imagine just for a moment that these growls are coming from a man. Would you be impressed? The answer is probably no unless you are highly inexperienced when it comes to death metal vocals. Also, I believe that some of the guitar solos could be longer, but again that's just my opinion. Of course, there is no doubt that the Amott brothers are skilled musicians!\n\nOverall, this has its flaws but still flows quite well. It gives what the fans want: melodeath. Maybe this is mainstream but I don't care. Does it matter if it's mainstream when it's good? No! So the conclusion is if you want some high-quality melodeath, then buy this. If you enjoyed the band's previous work, then buy this. If you never cared for the band and rejected them without listening to their music, then give this a try! If you already hate Arch Enemy for your own reasons, then this will definitely not change your mind. This is not a masterpiece, but it is still an enjoyable listen!\n",
        "\nArch Enemy has always been an epitome of great melodic death metal. I've grown tired of the Amott Brothers as they have gotten tired of being themselves. This album was not one of the few good albums. \n\nListening to this album gave me mixed feelings. The opening track wasn't a very good hook. It really lacked as does the rest of the album. The guitars don't sound very powerful on this album. The drums sound barely inspired and as always the bass inaudible. The lyrics aren't very good either. Their recent obsession with revolution and tyranny doesn't make very good song lyrics. It's been done before and I can stomach it on \"Doomsday Machine\". That album was actually good. The riffs were excellent and up to expectation. \"Rise of the Tyrant\" doesn't seem as so. \n\nThe Amott brothers are famous guitarists. They're known for being technically skilled. The guitar work they did on this album sucks. They don't seem to play the melodic death metal/thrash metal mix riffs they used to. It sounds like they got lazy and half-assed everything. They seem like they got tired of being titled \"so awesome\" by fans who are only on the ride for Gossow, and I don't mean vocally either. Not all the riffs sound melodic like they are known to write. Some riffs are acceptable but otherwise just not like the Amotts on their good albums. \"Intermezzo Libert\u00e8\", the album's instrumental, wasn't outstanding like all their other instrumentals. I'll hand it to them. Though I've grown tired of them and they don't appeal to me as they did they still write some excellent instrumentals. \"Hybrids of Steel\", from \"Doomsday Machine\", was epic. \"Intermezzo Libert\u00e8\" sounded uninspired and just thrown together. There was no real variation in the song. It was just three minutes of a clean backing riff with a bland solo trying to sound epic or at least sad as it follows the even worse \"The Day You Died\". The second I looked at that title I knew it was going to be lame, especially after listening to some of the album. I was right. The song sucked. If I wanted something cheesy I would gladly look up some bad power metal. By the time I got to \"Vultures\" I hoped it would at least redeem them. They failed horribly trying to muster up something at least melodic that wasn't melodic at all. In one of the songs they try to go early Children of Bodom on us by playing a riff that sounds neoclassical, almost like the \"Ode to Joy\" in Beethoven's 5th Symphony. They didn't even play all of whatever neoclassical thing they were trying to play, otherwise that riff would've been acceptable, unfortunately not exceptionable, but it ended as a tease. Also, in the beginning of the song \"Rise of the Tyrant\" there is a sound clip played from some movie. I don't know what movie it could be but the people sounded like they were in Congress in 1787 just by the way they spoke. It almost makes it seem like Arch Enemy is calling America a tyrant. Big deal. The band is now obsessed tyranny and it's annoying. They've lost all ability to write anything different. It's just not creative anymore.\n\nI would like to point out that in \"The Great Darkness\" it sounds like they say \"Satan\" or \"Satan- The only lord I believe in\" or some shit like that. I looked at the lyrics and it had nothing to do with what I heard. So I just have to ask what the fuck? Are Angela Gossow's vocals that hard to understand I heard \"Satan\"? Her vocals aren't very good this time around as they were on previous albums. Near the end of the album she half-sounded like one of those deathcore singers, probably from Bring Me the Horizon or some shit. \n\nThis album had a lack of inspiration, creativity, and ability to entertain. There were some enjoyable parts. The only track I enjoyed all the way through was \"In This Shallow Grave\" despite some weak lyrics. It wasn't their best effort so I hope they outdo themselves on their next album set for release 1 May, 2011 worldwide. Until then we can only hope they don't release an album as unimpressive as this, and they made promises that it should be better. We'll see, I can't wait to review that album.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy have been creating melodic death metal since their first release in 1996. Many fans consider the addition of Angela Gossow to be the downfall of the group. I've only heard Black Earth with Johan on vocals and judging by Doomsday Machine those people seem to be right. \n\nThe first thing I noticed when listening to this album was the vocals. God they are awful. Its not that the vocalist is female, iIts that Angela\u2019s vocals are so ridiculously processed and layered it just sounds terrible! It comes off mechanical and fake and totally ruins that part of the band and their music. \n\nSecondly, I have to point out her lyrics. They are extremely shallow and it sounds like they were written by a pissed off 6th grader. She takes lyrical immaturity to a new level.\n\nStill if you get passed the bad vocals and lyrics there is still some good music to be found here. The album starts off with an instrumental called Enter the Machine. Nothing real special but it does have a certain charm to it as it musically builds throughout the song. \n\nThe second track is Taking Back My Soul. This is a heavy number and the solo work by Christopher Amott is breathtaking. The actual verse riff isn\u2019t half bad itself but it\u2019s the riff during the chorus where the Amott brothers make it really work. The bridge isn\u2019t too bad either and guitar chops are shown through a rather impressive group of solos. \n\nAfter Taking Back My Soul is Nemesis. It starts off at thrash speeds but tapers off to a mid pace during the majority of the verse. This song especially showcases the awful lyrics and it becomes painful during the chorus. Once again the best of the music is during the chorus where Michael Amott can be heard playing a melodic little piece while Christopher keeps the rhythm going layered under his brothers guitar. \n\nIts with the songs after the next track, My Apocalypse, that the quality kind of drops off. This song itself isn\u2019t too bad and is a slower song but is quite enjoyable. There is an electronic sound that pops up throughout the song, like a radar ping on a submarine going off that sounds alright. Halfway through the song there is a sort of softer interlude with clean guitars being played and it\u2019s a nice change of pace. There is also a nice slower solo played here as well. The next song, Carry the Cross isn\u2019t that annoying but nothing really to speak of, it does have a strong chorus but its also VERY slow through the majority of it.\n\nThe album\u2019s drumming isn\u2019t too bad, Daniel plays quick, slow, whatever the song requires. He is a very competent drummer and its easy to see why he was chosen to replace Ken Owen after Carcass decided to reform (allowing him to play with his current band mate Michael Amott who is also in their lineup).\n\nThe rest of the tracks are kind of \u201cmeh\u201d, nothing special. Seems the first half of the album isn\u2019t actually all that bad, and depending on how you like your metal you might even enjoy the second half. But for me its just too difficult to get over the sad vocals and juvenile lyrics. This is a case where one person can single handedly ruin an otherwise alright album. So in summary, first half of album isn\u2019t too bad in spite of the shitty growling and bad lyrics because the songs are pretty good themselves but after that I kind of kept checking my watch wondering how much longer I'd have to listen to this.\n\nOriginally reviewed by me at http://abaddonsmetalshop.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nWhat a fucking transparent cash grab this is, and I bought it. To be fair I bought it because I'm a completionist, but that's really no excuse because there's no reason for anyone to be listening to Arch Enemy after the age of fifteen or so. I feel myself getting worried about geometry class already.\n\nSo this CD stitches together a random song snatched from 'Anthems Of Rebellion' (and not even a good one)- the track 'Dead Eyes See No Future' is a perfect example of the listless rock/melodeath that Arch Enemy would master later in their career- followed up by three live track that are essentially indistinguishable from their studio counterparts apart from a little bit of crowd noise and a production job even flatter than on the album. Oh, and you get to listen to Angela Gossow's always cringe-inducing stage banter. What a joy; 'Burning Angel' is one of the worst songs from the otherwise tolerable Gossow album, 'We Will Rise' is pretty still and bland, and 'Heart Of Darkness' follows suit- why were none of Arch Enemy's actual heavy tracks used? Do the fans hate those now.\n\nAfter that is what a lot of people probably bought the CD for: a set of three covers, each more embarrassing than the last. 'Symphony Of Destruction', not a good song to begin with, is made even more embarrassing and bland due to Gossow's voice and the listless instrumental performances of the rest of the band. Similarly, 'Kill With Power' is almost murdered by Arch Enemy's dedication to generic performances, but the song is powerful enough on its own to withstand even them. 'Incarnated Solvent Abuse' doesn't fair as well; Gossow's simply not cut out for a song like that and neither is the rest of the band (ironically enough), making for a disappointing conclusion to an already ill-advised EP.\n\nYeah, this sucks like the rest of this era of Arch Enemy. Don't buy it; it'll only encourage them to release more shitty music.\n",
        "\nThis is Arch Enemy's debut CD featuring the Amotts (Christopher and Michael) on guitars, bass guitar was also done on here by Michael until they found a replacement following this release, Daniel Erlandsson is on drums and former Johan Liiva on throat. Let me tell you that for a debut CD, there are many classic tracks on here. Michael is the force behind the riff writing with his brother contributed more so on the leads than on the rhythms. His leads are more technical than his brothers, whereas Michael's melodies/leads are more \"feeling\" based.\n\nThere is no intro exhibited here, just the slam of a snare beat then enter the band with vigor. From my standpoint, this debut could've been stronger if vocalist Johan had a little more variety to his bellowing throat outputs. There aren't too much variation exhibited on here from him, but his vocals don't drown out the melodic riffs. He just needed to have more feeling put into them. They were quite boring. I'd have to say that some of my favorite melodic tracks are on here are plentiful primarily because it's melodic death metal is my favorite genre, of which Arch Enemy plays dominates in.\n\nThe music features B-tuned guitars, which are thick and heavy throughout this whole CD. There are many tremelo picked rhythms as well as many melodic parts, especially during the chorus sections. They give the debut more augmentation to this aggressive main guitar riff-writing. The tempos vary. There are faster parts, more groove laden licks and slower chorus style writings. They keep the listener captivated with this writing ingenuity. In addition, there is an acoustic instrumental called \"Time Capsule\" and also a heavier one entitled \"Demoniality.\"\n\nAs I meantioned previously, there are some great lead guitar work by Christopher Amott. Just listen to the outro solo on \"Fields Of Desolation\" and you'll hear what I'm talking about. Christopher's leads are way more filled with arpeggios and speed picking than his brother Michaels. Like I mentioned again also, Michael has more emotion involved in his lead guitar work. He likes to use the wah-pedal exclusively on his solos. Michael was more technical when he was playing for Carcass, quite noteablely on their \"Heartwork\" release.\n\nThe production is solid, though the bass guitar is difficult to hear. All of the rest of the band member's main guitars, drums and vocals are well heard. The mixing was well done nevertheless and the guitars are what stands out the most here. Most tracks reflected how talented this band is. But getting rid of Johan was not a good move, even though his vocals here are more death metal oriented. This isn't the case on future releases when he was still with the band.\n\nOn the import CD of this release, there are some bonus tracks featuring Iron Maiden cover songs. Strange to hear them in B-tuning with Johan on vocals. Songs to check out here are \"Bury Me An Angel\", \"Eureka\" and \"Fields Of Desolation.\" If you're a big fan of melodic death metal, then you should check this CD out. It's what melodic death metal is totally about. You'll hear what I'm talking about if you decide to purchase the album.\n",
        "\nAlright, well this album is a great follow up from \"Stigmata\" (1998), but it lacks the heaviness of that their predecessor dishes out. Yes, it does this, but that doesn't make it a not so phenomenal release. Too many people, after they heard \"Burning Bridges\", gave it a lot of negative press and I heard a lot complaints. That would be such as the production not being thick enough, the leads were half-assed, and some guitar parts are just merely monotonous. The hell with that because there are some riffs on this release, especially the chorus of the song \"Pilgrim\", which makes my arm hair standup just to hear it.\n\nI agree that there will be no more \"Stigmata\" for the band. But like releases because that one is almost impossible for them to ever duplicate. But they didn't give up like At The Gates did after \"Slaughter of the Soul\" (1995). Sit down and listen, Arch Enemy has tons of material on here I think you'll learn to respect over time. To those metal guitarists, they are in B-tuning on here. That makes the music sound heavier and more brutal. However, this album remains to pull off melodic riffs with Johan not drowing out the riffs. Michael Amott coached Johan through the release to this album. His vocals go hand in hand with the songs quite well.\n\nCheck out the songs \"The Immortal\", \"Pilgrim\", \"Dead Inside\" and \"Silverwing.\" These, to me, are my personal favorite tracks. The later version of this release contains live songs, both new and old. The bonus CD features 17 tacks in all and runs for about 75 minutes in-length altogether. They are still able to pull off great the melodic riffs captured on their live songs. Definitely a good thing. \n\nA lot of the lyrics and sounds of it reveal dark depression some of us humans go throughout every day of our lives. To connect with that type of melancholy is great when you're really in that type of mood or maybe not? Nevertheless, \"Burning Bridges\" offers variety in songwriting style with no blast beating, but just great overall melodic death all the way through. They have a bonus track on here by Iron Maiden entitled \"Aces High.\"\n\nJohan Liiva, their previous vocalist, puts for I think his best vocal effort ever for Arch Enemy, making it that much easier to get into. Plus, it fits the music much better than say on the first Arch Enemy release entitled \"Black Earth\" (1996). The regular release of \"Burning Bridges\" isn't that track lengthy, but cherish every song because it will not let you down with just mediocre melodic death metal. Come on, this is Arch Enemy we are speaking of, they are giants within their own genre. Own it, now.\n",
        "\nI only just recently started getting into the whole melodic death metal thing, and this was actually the first Arch Enemy album I listened to. At the time, I had no idea it was re-recorded versions of older material, since I had never heard anything else by the band. Without the knowledge of this being re-recorded, I ignorantly listened and liked almost every minute of it. That in my opinion makes this a good album.\n\nAlthough I like the album, I can see how this album could disappoint a hardcore Arch Enemy fan. Instead of recording an album of new material they just recorded old stuff over again and if I were a huge Arch Enemy fan eagerly awaiting the next release of brand new songs and found out it was this I\u2019d be disappointed. Quite honestly, the album has no point beside a little extra easy money in the pockets of the band. \n\nThe re-recorded songs sound almost the same just with Angela Gossow on vocals instead of Johan and the newer sounding production. Both these things to me are a good thing. I prefer Angela\u2019s vocals to Johan\u2019s because when I listen to Johan he sounds very monotone and Angela has a lot of variety to her voice, even if it still isn\u2019t the greatest. The other difference is the new production, which doesn\u2019t bother me at all. Good production can never be a bad thing to my ears and I feel they did a good job producing this album. The biggest problem the album has is that the vocal are pushed really far forward in the mix and the other instruments sound muffled under them. This problem with the production is a pretty big one considering when the guitars and drums are standing alone without the vocal I think they sound great.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been listening to Arch Enemy since the beginning I doubt you\u2019ll enjoy this album. It will seem pointless and boring since you have already heard all these songs before, but if you are new to Arch Enemy like I was I would recommend giving this album a listen. While bands like Testament and Exodus completely changed the sound of their original releases with the re-recordings by down tuning the guitars and slowing the tempo, Arch Enemy does none of that here. The songs are exactly the same with Angela\u2019s vocals instead of Johan\u2019s and some different production, which makes the album a pointless addition to the Arch Enemy discography but still not a bad one.\n",
        "\nIf you want to hear the true Arch Enemy, buy the first 3 albums. Johan is so much better than Angela ever was. It seems like now all they care about is making money off they\u2019re putrid re-recording of songs from the first 3 albums. The vibe is just not them, Angela totally ruins the melodic riffs. I can\u2019t see why people envy her so much with her putrid vocals. The music lacks the energy it did of the first 3 albums.\n\nThe solos are not as good, the overall playing of the re-recording is just average. The melodic riffs are still there, but when Johan was with them, he seemed to make the music flow more. Maybe I\u2019m just biased about them having a female vocalist. I don\u2019t think so though. But the music and energy just isn\u2019t there. The vocal effects from Angela are an example of how too much technology went into the playing of this compilation.\n\nWhat I want to know is what ever happened to Christopher shining on his leads? The band as a whole just put on a sub-par release to eat away at your bank account. The riffs still have the feel of the old, just too much use of the technology into the recordings. Back in the day when technology was sub-par, it showed the bands having talent or not. This one seems to fade in the dust as the music is overusing the technological effects which makes it stale to me.\n\nI\u2019m really saddened by this decline in their ability to perform to where they were on the first 3 albums. Like I said before, maybe they\u2019re just after your money and the music is secondary. I think that the reason Christopher left was because of this happening to the band and no longer wanting to play extreme metal anymore. It could be the decline on the whole efforts by the band themselves.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t anything good to say about this release. Buy the first 3 albums and compare them to where they are now as a band. A lot of people dislike Johan and think that he\u2019s just an average vocalist but hell, he made his voice fit the music the most. I\u2019ll always feel this way about his time with the band. They made a mistake of kicking him out of the band. If he stayed with them, I\u2019m sure that fans would be able to appreciate them more.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy had been a band in my play list since I was 13, and since then my views of them have changed dramatically. I view them as a totally different group and, because of that, like them for different reasons than I did when I first heard Nemesis. I can say that, like many other fans, I got sucked in by the fact that, despite being DEATH METAL, they had a female vocalist. I first heard of them from a short interview with the femme fatale herself, Angela Gossow, on Metal: A Headbanger\u2019s Journey. I went on to hearing Doomsday Machine and Rise of the Tyrant before noticing that Gossow was not always fronting the band. \n\nThe man who had once been the vocalist of Arch Enemy is Johan Liiva. I heard his voice first from a live recording of \u201cLet the Killing Begin\u201d in terrible quality. I found his voice a lot harsher and grittier than Gossow\u2019s, and after a while my skepticism turned into interest, and I found myself wondering what Arch Enemy\u2019s debut album, Black Earth, sounded like. (Look at that CD cover and tell me you\u2019re not interested!) It\u2019s very hard to describe what I felt when first hearing Liiva after getting used to Gossow (I\u2019d been a fan of Gossow for 6 months by now), but I\u2019ll describe it as best as I can. \n\nRight from hearing the first track, Bury Me an Angel, I was left speechless. Although it is by no means as accessible or flashy as some of Arch Enemy\u2019s new stuff is, it really delivers on that \u201cheavy fuckin\u2019 metal\u201d tone a lot better than songs like \u201cRevolution Begins\u201d or \u201cThe Day You Died\u201d from Gossow\u2019s time. The guitars are down tuned all the way to B, giving it a real edge, especially coupled with Liiva\u2019s deep, raspy bark. I remember after first hearing Bury Me an Angel how the riff at 0:20 got stuck in my head and brought me back for more. The melodies on Black Earth are great, and tend to have more passion than in the newer stuff. In fact, I\u2019m just gonna come out and say it: this album beats the bejesus out of the modern Gothenburg Melodeath genre. It knows when it\u2019s time to be heavy and when to be melodic, and the two elements are combined excellently. Unlike modern \u201cmelodic death metal\u201d albums like A Sense of Purpose, you don\u2019t have to remind yourself that you aren\u2019t listening to Mallcore. It stays true and strong, \n\nThe guitars in the album are great, and not just talent-wise. They manage to write a ton of great riffs and solos that really carry most of the music, courtesy of the Amott brothers. A lot of the guitars will please fans of Carcass, especially those that liked Heartwork. The songs aren\u2019t written in any really technical way; it\u2019s really more of what I\u2019d consider your \u201cmeat-and-potatoes\u201d melodic death metal. Although believe me when I say this isn\u2019t the same Melodeath that comes to mind when you think of recent stuff. It doesn\u2019t follow the crappy songs about being depressed and emo, or write left-wing protest songs with clean-vocals choruses, it keeps to the genre and stays focused. \n\nThe album isn\u2019t just relentless non-stop brutality though; when I think of those things, I think of Cannibal Corpse: no interludes, no instrumentals, and the same overall feel that never alters from songs to song. In this album though, you get breaks from the heavy riffs in the form of relaxing and well-done solos that salute 80\u2019s hard rock and heavy metal. They serve as perfect interludes for you to relax and savor the music, rather than everything getting rushed through. The best example of this is in the song \u201cCosmic Retribution\u201d which has 2 solos and an acoustic interlude that makes this song my favorite in the bunch. There are also two instrumentals in this album: Demoniality and Time Capsule. Demoniality is one slow, heavy riff played several times that serves as an introduction to Transmigration Macabre, the fastest and most aggressive song on the album. I think that Demoniality shouldn\u2019t be its own track; I think it would have been better if it had been cut down and put right into the song Transmigration Macabre. Time Capsule is quite different; a looser, more relaxing solo accompanying a simple acoustic riff. \n\nAlthough it may be hard for some of you to get used to (it certainly took me a while), Liiva\u2019s voice becomes infectious. Although it doesn\u2019t have the range it did in the follow-up album Stigmata, and certainly not the range he had in Burning Bridges, there\u2019s a lot of passion in his vocals, and you can sense his enthusiasm. A small fault in the album that does detract from the overall score is the lyrics. Yes, apparently the uninspired vocals that Arch Enemy has had have been around since before Gossow was writing them. Usually the lyrics are just average, but for the chorus of Eureka (\u201cEUREKA! I FOUND THE SECRET OF LIFE! EUREKA!\u201d), you can see that the vocals weren\u2019t the main concentration of the music, for sure. But in my opinion, this album is still better than anything released while Gossow was at the mike, and it\u2019s unfortunate that no one can seem to combine melody and brutality the same way as was done in Arch Enemy\u2019s first three albums. A good way to describe the music on Black Earth would be if you imagined Carcass\u2019 \u201cHeartwork\u201d combined with Furbowl\u2019s \u201cThose Shredded Dreams\u201d. I recommend this to anyone who wants to hear a good Melodeath album for a change, but I\u2019d recommend Arch Enemy\u2019s magnum opus, Stigmata, first. \n\nRecommended songs: \nCOSMIC RETRIBUTION: Short and sweet, but it really packs a punch. The double solo and acoustic interlude are what set it apart from the rest of the songs. \n\nTIME CAPSULE: Really nice solo melody that brings you back to earth and puts you in a good mood right before the climax of the album. \n\nIDOLATRESS: Liiva\u2019s vocals get really intense on this one, although the chorus is repeated one too many times at the end. The solo here takes on the soft-slow approach that you would expect to hear from a Metallica power ballad, and takes on a quick arpeggio form as it nears the end.\n\nOriginally posted on spirit-of-metal.com under the username InfinityZero.\n",
        "\nI was fortunate enough to have received this album as a freebie when Arch Enemy came to play here in the Philippines last year. I consider this to be my favorite pre-Gossow Arch Enemy album. While this isn't as heavy as 'Stigmata' or 'Black Earth', this is a more focused and consistent effort rather than merely a Michael Amott solo project that some people felt with the previous records. \n\nThe songs move towards a mix of thrash, melodic death, groove and at times, 80's metal. This made them differ from other Swedish melodic metal bands in the day. Even though they put more emphasis on melody this time, tracks are still generally fast paced with hints of thrash and groove all around. Worth mentioning is 'Silverwing', one of the highlights on this album with its amazing harmonious intro, the thrashing verse section, and the very melodic and anthemic chorus and solo section.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the guitar work is tremendous here, thanks to the Amott brothers. A hardcore Arch Enemy listener could probably always recognize Michael Amott's signature sound. That is what is present here, especially on the leads and solos. The solo section on 'The Immortal' is another highlight here as well as 'Angelclaw'. Christopher Amott deserves his kudos too, given that he is the more technical of the two soloists. One of the reasons why I pointed out that this was a focused album is that the rhythm division (bass & drums) could really keep the structure and cadence of the songs even if they are uncomplicated and straightforward. The oddest song here would have to be the title track. It is quite slow-paced, and backed with atmospheric keyboards and piano towards the end but sad to say, it was ultimately lackluster. I would have preferred a simple instrumental track and another shorter full song. Finally, Johan Liiva\u2019s trademark vocal delivery is still what it is, the mid-ranged and abrasive bark, although I felt that it was a bit weaker now than on \u2018Stigmata\u2019.\n\nWhat I hear is an Arch Enemy that shifted to a more melodic approach which in turn could have most likely marked the transition towards 'Wages of Sin'. Overall, the album has a cleaner and more refined sound than its predecessors, almost giving a feeling and sense of triumph and conquest. Sacrificing intensity of previous albums for catchy melodies and grooves does not signal a regression from form. In fact, I believe that Arch Enemy had attained their true essence with 'Burning Bridges'. If you\u2019re interested in checking out the old Arch Enemy, this is a pretty good starting point.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy found their biggest success with the release of Rise of the Tyrant, which made it on the famed Billboard 200 in 84th place. It brought a lot of fans to the Gossow side and got them going for the band after the (perceived) flop of Doomsday Machine. What do I think of this album? I'll sum it up with one word: \n\nOVERRATED. \n\nOf course, it isn't really a surprise. Just about every melodic death metal album that comes out of Sweden nowadays is overrated in the same way. I will give it this much: while it is overrated, it isn't a total loss. This album has it's good points. For example, this album is Gossow's best vocal performance to date. The album also has a few songs that remind me of the good old days. And compared to bands that have gone downhill WAY faster than Arch Enemy under the same genre (I'm looking at you, In Flames), it holds up much better than other Swedish Melodeath albums released around the same time. So, why do I think that this album is overrated when every other fan can't get enough of it? I'll tell you. \n\nThe main problem that Arch Enemy has had since Liiva was kicked to the curb STILL persists here. The bloody repitition of the choruses.If you don't know what I mean, listen to Revolution Begins. It's the same pattern of verse-chorus-verse-chorus that's way too plain and standard. It's unquestionably the most boring and uninspired song on here. And of course, it repeats the chorus line WAY too much (another problem that's followed Arch Enemy around for a long time). Most of the songs here follow that same pattern, and it's pretty frustrating. There isn't too much to surprise you or stick out in most of the songs, when you listen to all of them in a row. It's really unfortunate too, especially when you consider that this is the band that released Stigmata and Burning Bridges. Too many of the songs keep with the same pace and use the same tricks, and that's this album's major downfall. \n\nNow that the complaining is done, time to move on to the positives. This album starts in with 2 songs that I still consider great songs. \"Blood on your Hands\" and \"The Last Enemy\" are legitimately good songs. Not to mention the solos are pretty good too. (Not as good as the stuff from the early albums, but hey, they beat the bejesus out of the solos from Anthems). On top of that, Gossow's vocals sound really good. I'm not kidding. That's the one thing that manages to stay good for most of the album. None of the feeble growls from Anthems of Rebellion, she really manages to make a good performance. The title song is pretty good as well, but that intro is ridiculous. \"This Shallow Grave\" starts good, (the section from 0:29-0:49 is awesome), but it's wrecked by being repeated until it gets stale. I like the solo sections from \"Vultures\", and that's about all there is to this album. \n\nRise of the Tyrant isn't all that good, but there are things that manage to save it from being a complete failure. Some memorable songs, Gossow's vocals have improved a lot, (too bad she couldn't keep it up for Root of All Evil) and the album is MUCH more consistent than the previous Gossow releases. All in all, I say it's an average album. Not great, not terrible, but average.\n\nOriginally written for spirit-of-metal.com\n",
        "\nSince Johan Liiva's departure in 2000 and Angela Gossow's introduction to the band as the new vocalist in 2001, Arch Enemy fans have been split in half. As the years went on, most of the old fans dropped away from Arch Enemy and new ones came in to hear what they thought to be the only metal band with a female growler/screamer. They started calling the old music garbage, too.\n\nBut I think differently. While I don't completely hate the Gossow period, the Johan Liiva period was what made the band tight and original, and not only because of Johan's barking vocals that were neither growl or scream. The quitars were also very, very technical. The riffs were intense, and didn't sound forcibly \"talented\". The solos were incredible, not only demonstrating the talent and teamwork behind the Amott brothers, but they wanted to make you stand on your roof and raise your fist in triumph. They made you feel like breaking through brick walls. If you don't believe me, listen to the album Stigmata.\n\nThe album starts with \"Beast of Man\", which to me is there to show you that your listening to Arch Enemy. It's a song similar to the ones you'd hear off their debut album Black Earth. What I notice is that it's a lot more flowy than most of the stuff off of the previous album, but it keeps that brutality that only Arch Enemy can have. By Arch Enemy's standards though, it's a good song, but not great. It wouldn't have made too much of a difference to me if it had been left off, or put into another track number. It doesn't work too well as an intro song, and that's because of what comes next. \n\nThe title song is a 2 minute instrumental that kicks too much ass to decribe. Like I said above, It makes you feel like you could break through brick walls. It's incredible. THIS should be the intro song. It serves perfectly to show you what Arch Enemy is made of. I've always thought that the Amott brothers were the best part of Arch Enemy, and this song proves it. It also works perfectly as an intro to Sinister Mephisto. Instantly you see that the band has dramatically improved and grown. The song does take a mid pace for most of the time, at least compared to previous songs like Bury Me an Angel or Transmigration Macabre. The solo of Sinister Mephisto almost matches Stigmata, while sounding completely different. Every time I hear the solo, I need to rewind and hear it again. No other Arch Enemy song has ever done that much for me. It kicks the crap out of any solo on the Gossow albums, that's for sure. Johan Liiva's voice is as coarse and harsh as ever, and it definitely delivers through the entire album. His vocal performance has also noticeably improved since the last release. The drums, although not done by the well-known Arch Enemy drummer Daniel Erlandsson, are really well done. I think this guy competes with Erlansson, but apparently he didn't fit what the band was \"trying to acheive\". Funny, that's the same reason Johan got kicked off. \n\nThe album continues in a way that almost every song brings something new to the table for Arch Enemy, without damaging their infusion of melody and brutality. Dark of the Sun is an overall slower song, but I still love it, especially the guitar section that comes in between verses. In Let the Killing Begin, Johan's vocals seem a little bit tired, for some reason. They don't seem to really put an impression on the song. The chorus riff sounds a bit like the chorus riff from Bury Me an Angel, but otherwise it's a good song, and it has another really good solo. Black Earth (yeah, that's a sng from this album) is something that Arch Enemy has never tried again. It's quite a different song, but it's a serious headbanger, and I love that intro. The vocals are particularly stong in this song, and it's good that it comes right after Let the Killing Begin. It gets you right back into Liiva's voice. I think it would be nice if a verse or two were left out, because the song seems to go on a bit too long. Vox Stellarum is the only other instrumental on the album, and it consists of a slow piano melody that's accompanied by a double guitar solo, and the two instruments go so well together. Again, nothing like this has every been done by Arch Enemy again. Moving on to the final song, which serves as a good ending song and it's also the longest Arch Enemy song every recorded, clocking at 9 minutes. It has a really nice power ballad outro remeniscent of something early Metallica would write that always resonates with me when the album ends.\n\nThe songs on Stigmata average at 5 or 6 minutes, making them a lot longer than most other Arch Enemy songs, and the overall album comes off a little slower than any other Arch Enemy album by a little bit, but they all have their fast and agressive parts, so you should be satysfied either way, and just about everything makes up for it if you aren't. Every instrument perfectly compliments each other, the down tuned guitars work really well with Johan's bass-driven voice. I always feel great listening to this album. Not only is it the best Arch Enemy album by a long shot, it's my favorite melodic death metal album too. My favorite songs here are Stigmata, Sinister Mephisto, and Dark of the sun. I love this album, and I'm kind of glad that there are so many things here that weren't done in the Gossow period. They're something that should stay solely reserved for this album.\n",
        "\nWhen I first put this album in, I wasn't really sure what to expect. It was my first Arch Enemy album with Johan doing the vocals. I have listened to the newer Doomsday Machine and Rise of the Tyrant albums, but once I finished Stigmata, I knew there was no comparison. Johan has a dominating voice that adds so much power to the songs. He ruled Arch Enemy. \n\nTo me, Arch Enemy with Johan and Arch Enemy with Angela are 2 different bands. And I have to say...Johan's Arch Enemy definitely rules over Angela. The vocals are one of a kind. Perfectly crafted to Mike and Chris' guitaring. Sure he didn't have amazing stage performance...(which unfortunately the reason he was booted off,) but his voice is like no other. A great metal vocalist with great sound, yet you can understand most of the lyrics. The power of his voice is amazing, spreading from the first song to the last in a perfect balance. He is definitely one of the beat metal vocalists of all time. Johan really knew how to do it. \n\nMike and Chris need credit where credit is due. This band wouldn't be melodic death metal without them. Great speedy riffs along with solos that swap between each of the Amott brothers really makes a kick ass sound. This album definetly holds the best of the Amott brothers. their guitar skills exceeds expectations by far in all 16 songs. One of the Amott brothers best elements are the slow deep notes that quickly hit into a speedy intricate semi-solo/riff (referring to the song stigmata) really makes a great instrumental song. Martin plays bass with some exceptional talent. His powerful bass parts add so much to the atmosphere of this album. \n\nAs for the drums, Daniel makes a sick beat. Drums mean a lot to a metal band. The constant double bass sometimes gets a little boring. But with Daniel on set, this isn't so. Different beats within beats make up a great part for set. Also, they aren't too heavy, which is nice cus you can enjoy the other instruments without overpowering them. Daniel is just a total badass with kick ass beats and nasty double bass. This kid can plow through anything. This album was a cheap recording of him but it doesn't matter. He's a total fucking tank. \n\nThere are 9 songs on this album (16 if you have the deluxe edition) and none of them are a waste. All of them have a great quality... and quantity of music. Each song leads into the next with absolute perfection. Also, the drums are in constant sync with the speedy and perfectly crafted riffs of the guitars. No other album in the genre of melodic death metal can top this. Arch Enemy is the definition of melodeath, and always will be. This is what is known as perfectly engineered melodic death metal.\n",
        "\nWhen I first read the news that Arch Enemy was going to follow in the steps of bands like Testament, Twisted Sister, and Sodom, I wasn't really surprised. Despite being the minority of AE fans, there is still a lot of support for the songs on their first three albums. Consequently, since these fans are in the minority, those songs constitute the minority of your typical AE live set, or in some cases are absent altogether. So now we have The Root Of All Evil, the band's attempt to bring those older songs to a new audience so they can be more widely known and therefore played live to the pleasure of all fans, old and new. (Though I'm sure we all know the real reason why this was done. Hint: $) How does it fare compared to the original recordings? Not well.\n\nThe song selection is largely unsurprising. From Black Earth (1996): \"Bury Me An Angel\", \"Dark Insanity\", \"Demoniality\", \"Transmigration Macabre\". From Stigmata (1998): \"Beast Of Man\" and \"Bridge Of Destiny\". From Burning Bridges (1999): \"The Immortal\", \"Dead Inside\", \"Pilgrim\", \"Demonic Science\" and \"Silverwing\". Also included is \"Diva Satanica\", which has been a bonus track on a few albums in a few different countries. While I could sit here and really nit-pick, I'll just say that a few of my favorites are missing and the inclusion of Demoniality is puzzling, considering it's the worst of AE's instrumental tracks.\n\nThe music here is almost identical to the original compositions. Since some of the songs here were written and recorded before bassist Sharlee D'Angelo was a part of the band some of the bass lines are reworked but this is largely unnoticeable on the final product. The guitar work here is a tragedy. The aggression and emotion that was on the original recordings has been erased with a squeaky clean production job, leaving the guitars flat and unappealing. Sections of some songs, such as The Immortal and Dead Inside, sound as if they have been slowed down compared to the originals. The drumming is mostly identical to the original recordings, and is solid throughout the album. Angela Gossow's vocals are the biggest detriment to this release. I enjoyed a lot of the material on Wages Of Sin and Rise Of The Tyrant, but here I just can't hear past them. They are weak and over-produced and frankly sound like shit. She also enunciates the lyrics differently in some areas which really disrupts the flow of the music and is very distracting to hear. They don't add anything new to the songs here.\n\nOverall this release is a waste of resources that could have been used in recording a new album of original material. It lacks emotion, sounds lifeless, and sucks the life out of the songs. If you haven't heard the early albums then just listen to those and not this pathetic cash grab. If this does result in more of the old stuff being played live then great, but I still say that this was unnecessary.\n",
        "\nThis new album by Arch Enemy is a disappointing one to review for me, if I am honest. On the one hand, in light of their recent horror stories, this is yet another chapter in their tome of predictability and serious lack of any real edge. On the other hand, this isn\u2019t quite as jaw-droppingly awful as, say, \u2018Anthems of Rebellion\u2019 was. But it\u2019s pretty close. And no one is more let down than I, as Arch Enemy were literally THE band that got me into metal in the first place, so to see them regurgitate such rubbish as this really does hit a nerve.\n\nAnd it has been a pretty swift and unmerciful fall from grace. Remember when the Amott brothers were two of the most celebrated guitarists in the whole genre of melodic death metal (and I genuinely believe that it was not just because they just happened to be brothers)? Remember \u2018Burning Bridges\u2019? And of course, don\u2019t forget that they were one of the first female fronted metal bands before it was cool. So\u2026 what is it that\u2019s going wrong on albums like this?\n\nWell, they\u2019ve become very comfortable in the little niche that they have created for themselves, haven\u2019t they? Nothing wrong with that. Except, there is something wrong with that. The problem is, their niche sucks. It sucks badly. Case in point: the second riff of \u2018Blood On Your Hands\u2019 or the main riff to \u2018Vultures\u2019. Speaking subjectively, I just fucking hate these little offbeat, slightly syncopated riffs they have scattered randomly throughout their later CDs. It feels like they have simply run out of ideas and this is the only thing they have left in reserve to make things interesting. The wanky and pointless \u2018widdly-widdly\u2019 bits after every verse, the crass and insincere self-empowering lyrics, the train timetable verse-chorus-verse-chorus\u2026 it\u2019s as dull as dishwater, as it pains me to say it about a band that I used to hold in such high regard.\n\nDespite my initial loathing of this album, there are some things I will say for Rise of the Tyrant. Firstly, the album is more consistent than their other post Wages of Sin efforts. Even though I am annoyed at the way it is employed, its pretty difficult to deny Arch Enemy\u2019s collective musical ability. Even though you know exactly where and when the solos are about to come in (and to a certain extent what scales are going to be played), when they eventually do, they are expertly played, if instantly forgettable in terms of material. Songs like \u2018In This Shallow Grave\u2019 momentarily threaten to spark a glimmer of hope, and also\u2013 shock horror! There is some sense of musical progression on this album! Whereas on Doomsday Machine the band borrowed elements of industrial metal in the crunch of the guitar production, here they have taken on a slightly groovier approach, which may sound appealing, but only insofar as they sound a bit more like DevilDriver now.\n\nGuys, seriously, why is this album getting so much praise? There are some real turds floating around this stagnant lake of retarded musical crap. \u2018Blood On Your Hands\u2019 is positively awash with clich\u00e9, \u2018I Will Live Again\u2019 is the very epitome of lazy and uninspired song writing, through to the token instrumental \u2018Intermezzo Liberte\u2019 track for Amott to wank all over with some needless shredding. \n\nRise of The Tyrant is a full on fart in the face. The punchy riffs on this album were the filler riffs from albums like Burning Bridges and Wages of Sin. I want to say that they can do better, but I am finding less and less evidence for this. With albums like Rise of The Tyrant, Arch Enemy will only ever be the band that introduces young kids to metal, and at this rate it won\u2019t belong before the kids mature, grow up, get a clue, and move on.\n",
        "\nIf you are a fan of Arch Enemy then I am sure you are fully aware that metal queen Angela Gossow has not always been the one vocally expressing the bands music. For their first three albums, Black Earth, Stigmata and Burning Bridges it was Johan Liiva that carried the vocal responsibilities. And now, with The Root Of All Evil, Angela burns up the microphone with re-recorded tunes from those three starter albums. \n\nSo if you are not too familiar with the bands first albums then you may wind up being just a bit confused and think the songs sound a bit heavier and not so much the sing along songs we have come to know and love. The guitar work is just as impressive as before and the drumming just as great. It's hard to review re-recorded albums as one of the only things you end up doing is comparing the two. So there are going to be the fans that prefer Johan's vocals more and those of us who like Angela's added spice. I am one of the fans that like Angela's pipes but still can appreciate Liiva's previous contributions to the band.\n\nThere are 2 songs from Stigmata, that being Beast of man and Bridge of destiny. The immortal, Dead Inside, Pilgrim and Demonic Science all come from Burning Bridges while Transmigration Macabre, Dark Insanity and Burn Me An Angel, spawning from Black Earth. On this cd you will find some new bass lines by D'Angelo and you will notice just how much tighter the Amott brothers sounds. The overall production on this cd is what makes it a hit for me. I enjoyed the albums when they were first recorded and enjoy the songs just as much having been re-recorded.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are a hardcore fan of Swedish Death Metal band Arch Enemy's first three cd's and not up for change then steer clear of this release. Otherwise I would say it is enjoyable. \n\nOriginally written for www.xplosivemetal.com\n",
        "\nWell here we go, another album from Arch Enemy and another instance of a band re-recording old songs and marketing them as a new album. I guess we can give them credit for releasing albums at such a consistent pace, but much of their previous work has been really disappointing, despite a lot of potential.\n\nArch Enemy was formed in 1995 as a Michael Amott project after leaving Carcass. This is their 10th full-length album, including live releases (they have also released a few EPs), and sixth featuring female vocalist Angela Gossow.\n\nRemember the days when a Death Metal band with a female growler was something new and different? Now it seems like every band lacking in talent is using a female growler as a gimmick. That\u2019s not to say that Arch Enemy isn\u2019t talented, in fact when Gossow was first added, very few bands had anything like it. However, now that this publicity stunt is wearing thin, it\u2019s becoming painfully obvious how much she detracts from the band\u2019s music. If you are lonely enough that seeing a moderately attractive, yet undeniably masculine, woman fronting a band makes your day, then I\u2019m happy for you.\n\nFor those with more objective tastes, one has to wonder just whose idea it was to release this as an album. I was never crazy about Johan Liiva, but hearing these soulless re-recordings makes me appreciate what he gave to the band. Sure, he sounded exactly like Barney Greenway of Napalm Death, but at least he growled and yelled with intensity. These re-recordings had me looking at my watch so I could see just how much longer I would have to hear songs that I really liked being destroyed.\n\nThe only positive aspect is that the recording sounds a bit better than the originals, thanks to Andy Sneap, but if your only desire is to hear these songs with better sound, just pick up the remasters that have been released of each of the three Liiva albums over the past few years.\n\nBack when these albums were originally released, the music sounded aggressive; two hotshot guitarists showing the world what they have to offer. Now the music sounds like a stale retread, with accomplished musicians going through the motions. The sound is good, everything else sucks. Save your money and avoid.\n\n(Originally Published at www.metal-temple.com)\n",
        "\nThis is my first review of an album. It's The Root of All Evil, the newest release from the Swedish melodic death metal act, Arch Enemy. For those that don't know, Root of All Evil is a rehashing of 12 of Arch Enemy's most well known songs from when Johan Liiva was still the vocalist for the band. That was my favorite era of the band, and since I'm one of the few who prefer the early years to the more recent ones, I think I should give my opinion on whether or not these rehashings live up to the standards of the originals.\n\nLike I said, I'm personally more a fan of Arch Enemy's Johan Liiva era than the Angela Gossow era, although not just for the preference of vocals. The riffs were more powerful, catchier, more melodic and emotional (especially Stigmata) and, most importantly, Anthems of Rebellion is not part of the Liiva discography. However, I did somewhat like Wages of Sin and I thought Rise of the Tyrant was okay. Anyway, when I first heard this album was coming out, I thought that the album would only have 3 or 4 songs from that era as well as some original material to tide the fans over for a new album. That would've been nice, but I guess, like Mike Amott said, this album was made to give \"new life\" to the old material.\n\nMy first thought was that the songs were plenty good as they were and didn't need to be changed, but I admit that I was still somewhat interested. The first thing I noticed was how the guitars were tuned. During the Liiva era, the guitars were tuned in Drop D for a dark feel, a more interesting sound with the guitar solos and they complimented Liiva's voice. In this album, the guitars sound like they've been tuned up half a step. I know that Gossow has a considerably higher pitched voice, but I would've been happy if they'd left the guitars at standard tuning. They also sound watered down by the too-clear production to a point where they don't bring the original emotions or feelings that came with songs like Pilgrim, Demonic Science, or Bridge of Destiny. The solos are decent but are merely reflections of the original solo work that made you want to go nuts. Another thing are the drums. A disappointment that came with Rise of the Tyrant was that the drums were pushed back and quiet, and even when you could here them they were a little boring. In this album, they are louder, and they are faster, but there are times when you feel like you're hearing the same thing over the course of this album. And then Angela's vocals come in.\n\nAlmost every Arch Enemy album review has a section dedicated to talking about the vocals. Now, I've heard a lot about how fans think Liiva's voice sounds boring and lifeless, but the fans that disagree with that statement can use this album to back up their retorts. Just like in Anthems of Rebellion, Angela Gossow's vocals seem very underutilized and sometimes could be called monotonous. On top of that, they're way too distorted. If they like showcasing their female vocalist so much, then why would they distort them so much? For those of you who think Johan Liiva's voice is worse, listen to the Root of All Evil version of \"Dead Inside\" next to the original Burning Bridges version. In the Root of All Evil, the vocals seem incredibly watered down and are a definite step backwards from the more-than-decent vocals Angela was using in Rise of the Tyrant. I have nothing against Gossow, but her voice has been so hit-and-miss over the years that I'm getting impatient. This album fails to breathe any kind of new life into the songs. On the contrary, it only seems to suck the life out of them. The biggest fault with the vocals is that they seem to not flow at all, and every syllable for certain songs (Transmigration Macabre is a good example) is just emphasized and sometimes doesn't even match the music following them. And Transmigration Macabre was one of my favorite Liiva era songs. There is one song here that was written for this album, and that's the intro track, titled \"Root of all Evil\". And do you know what I noticed? The song is just \"Demoniality\" done with high-pitched keyboards! And \"Demoniality\" is on this album already! I get that it makes the listener anticipate the album more but why would they put Demoniality TWICE in one album? Demoniality was never even that good to begin with!\n\nThere is one genuinely good thing about this album is the improved sound quality. I've heard it time and time again from fans that tell me about this album. The quality is definitely better, I'll agree, but I never considered that the old material's sound quality was even that bad to begin with. And even if you do need the best quality there is, Arch Enemy recently released digitally remastered versions of Johan Liiva's old albums. Outside the good sound quality, there was nothing that really caught my attention here. Everything else people say is good about this album is stuff like how the riffs are good or catchy, but they were the same in the original songs, so I can't give this album credit for that.\n\nIn short, this album ended up being disappointing and dissatisfying. This album was a waste of my time.\n",
        "\nIt is with no great shame that I will admit to enjoying this album. However, that\u2019s still no excuse for making it. For those of you who don\u2019t know, Arch Enemy have become extremely popular with the mall-ish crowd in the last few years for their more recent material, which stars the resident lass of the lacerated lungs, Angela Gossow. Now, most of those kids are Neanderthals, who don\u2019t know anything about music, and as such, didn\u2019t even know the old songs when the band played them live. I mean really, what kind of fan do you have to be to not know a band\u2019s full discography, at least in passing? It\u2019s positively maddening, but of course Arch Enemy pandered and remastered their older material so these Neanderthals could know what songs they were playing live. What\u2019s going to happen when they play an old song that wasn\u2019t on this compilation? Who knows? I don\u2019t care, though; this compilation just smokes, and I\u2019m here to review it, so let\u2019s get started.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how one man can make a stale metal formula sound good. I\u2019m of course talking about Chris Amott, who is the only reason I even checked this out, after enjoying his side band Armageddon so much. His guitar playing, as on Embrace the Mystery, is classic-metal oriented, with a lot of biting, gnashing riffs and melodious, searing leads for anyone\u2019s consumption. It\u2019s really hard to dislike this music; it\u2019s just too un-pretentious and earnest. Everything about this is just bare-bones classic metal glory, with the only deviation being Gossow\u2019s vitriolic barking, which actually doesn\u2019t even sound that bad a lot of the time, being layered and polished to something suitably demonic. The riffs just keep coming at you, polished but not weakened or sterile in any way, and the leads are always entertaining and passionate, bursting with a dazzling flare that will no doubt be wasted on the kids who are only into this music for the \u201cfucking brutal shit, dude.\u201d But I digress.\n\nAnd no, I haven\u2019t heard the original versions of any of these songs. I know some people will bitch about how they\u2019re too polished compared to the rawer original versions, but to that I say, don\u2019t you think this band would have made these songs sound like this if they had the proper money and materials to, even back then? I highly doubt that 90% of extreme metal bands intended for their works to be as raw as they were \u2013 hell, most of them probably would\u2019ve liked a louder, fuller sound if that would have been possible. I\u2019m not going to claim that most of the extreme metal classics were only accidental in their atmosphere and unique feel, but I will say that there is definitely no conspiracy to ruin the classics here, or anywhere where old bands try to update their classic material. We don\u2019t know what they originally intended when they wrote their music, and I find it pretty presumptuous for anyone to try and decry the band just for updating the sound alone, especially if it sounds this good.\n\nAnd I have heard something about the band editing the songwriting itself, but like I said, it sounds good. They are always on top of things here. I do think this whole thing runs on a bit long, and that kind of hurts the material, but the songs are just solid as hell. It\u2019s really quite bare-bones material: just play the riffs, let the solos rip out and have a fucking good time, no strings attached. And the best part about it? This has turned me onto the band and made me want to hear more of their material, and that is the best compliment I can give it. They crafted a good synthesis of their early works and featured kick-ass songs like \u201cThe Immortal,\u201d the diabolical \u201cDemonic Science,\u201d the slower burn \u201cBury Me an Angel\u201d and the exquisitely good \u201cBridge of Destiny,\u201d and overall, I\u2019m impressed. Check this out if you\u2019ve never heard the band before. It\u2019s good stuff. \n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nWow, this album kicks ass left and right. Why does it seem that every single good melodic death metal band has either split-up or completely deviated genres so far away from melodic death metal that it is barely, if at all, metal anymore (except for Dark Tranquility)? Most people that I speak to are completely unaware of THIS Arch Enemy's existence. They are familiar with the much more polished production of the metalcore influenced Arch Enemy, which is a damned fucking shame. This is the complete opposite of anything that the band would later produce, and no, it's not because I don't like the fact that there is a woman doing metal vocals.\n\nLiva's vocals are a very acquired taste. Not everyone is going to like them because they are not your every day melodic death vocal style. In fact, I don't know anything who has a style like his in all of metal, but I can't think of anyone who would so flawlessly fit the raw, dark, almost progressive feel of Stigmata. The cover art is actually a great depiction of how this album feels: bleak, artsy, raw. The lyrics fit the music perfectly, as well. \"A Day will come, When the sun will rise again, Rays of black will shine, And together as one, We will walk in the dark of the sun.\"\n\nThis album has everything- relatively good lyrics, dark atmosphere, progressive elements (\"Vox Stellarum\", the guitar solo in \"Let the Killing Begin\"), full throttle fury (\"Beast of Man\", \"Black Earth\") very melodic moments (\"Stigmata\"), and a great overall flow. This is one of those albums that get more awesome each time you listen to it because there is so much going on it's almost impossible to catch on first listen. A ton of styles are blended in at once in more of a Mastodon way than some shitty grind/electro/punk whatever band. which is definitely a good thing because as we all know, diversity is key in music.\n\nAs I've hinted at before, the Amott brothers are at the top of their game here. They are at their most brutal, melodic and progressive. Wildoer compliments the band just fine, but he's personally not my favorite member of this band because his sound is not as distinctive as all of the other members. If you love melodic death metal and you're a drummer, I suggest you listen to Arsis or something, not Arch Enemy.\n\nAll In all, while I fucking love Black Earth and Burning Bridges, Stigmata beats them both out. The gritty production of Stigmata gives it more feel than Burning Bridges and it is much more consistent than Black Earth. Since I don't enjoy any Arch Enemy after Burning Bridges, this obviously means that Stigmata is in my opinion Arch Enemy's greatest accomplishment. Once again, this is a very acquired taste, so I'd suggest giving this a listen straight through three times before coming to a final conclusion on how to feel about Stigmata. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy have had a unique career as a melodic death metal band, since the band was partially born out of the heritage of grindcore pioneers Carcass through Michael Amott\u2019s presence. The band underwent a massive shift when they dropped original vocalist Johan Liiva for Angela Gassow in 2000, opening the way for an entirely new sound. This two-song single was distributed on the eve of the third album with Gassow\u2019s release, containing the songs Nemesis and I Am Legend / Out for Blood from the upcoming Doomsday Machine album. \n\nFirst off is Nemesis, one of the two songs off the Doomsday Machine having a video and rightly considered by the band as one of the album\u2019s highlights. This is an extremely fast-paced melodic death metal song which incorporates much of the new Arch Enemy sound; namely, very slick production values over a rather technical instrumental sound augmented by Angela Gassow\u2019s somewhat overdone vocals. This unique sound is the reason behind all the criticism for newer Arch Enemy albums. It\u2019s partly justifiable, given the song\u2019s notoriously artificial sound and feeling, yet this doesn\u2019t necessarily imply it\u2019s weak. Indeed, Nemesis features a series of very memorable riffs which, while they don\u2019t reach the almost-organic feel of the first few albums, are still enjoyable. \n\nThe second track is I Am Legend / Out for Blood, a considerably slower number featuring much more prominent drum work, closer to standard death metal than the band\u2019s usual material. The guitar work is also of good quality, even featuring a short solo which is good but nowhere near the level of the band\u2019s first three albums. This song is also somewhat more violent in lyrical content than the usual Arch Enemy stuff, although this doesn\u2019t really mean much and it\u2019s far from being gory or anything. \n\nThis single is pretty useless since both tracks are on all versions of Doomsday Machine and Nemesis also exists in the form of a video which is easy to find online. The music isn\u2019t too bad overall but Nemesis is the only track that really distinguishes itself with its searing intensity, while I Am Legend / Out for Blood is rather generic. This is a surprisingly good representation of new Arch Enemy, with some exceptional music released next to some rather bland stuff.\n",
        "\nChris and Mike Amott are some of the best guitarists in any band respectively. I appreciate fine musicianship and talent when it is applied to good guitar metal. I however cannot decipher 'Wages of Sin' and call it refreshing or give any song its own identity, for this reason I have to say that the Swedish sound is getting rather watered down. 'Wages of Sin', although a rapidly well played effort, is no different than anything else guitar orientated coming from this gothenburg/melodic sound. The riffing an be best described as choppy, finely pitched and repetitive.\n\nThe only decent track I found of this album was 'Burning Angel'. Angela's vocals cannot be any more ferocious and come through very manly. I used to have to convince my non metal listening friends that it was a woman, no doubt she has a well endowed throat (no pun intended) and she is a better singer than Johan ever was but like the guitars,her voice is the same all the way through. Daniel is a pretty damn good drummer and Sharley, well Sharley has done his time in the metal world with the likes of fellow countrymen 'Witchery' and 'Sinergy', both great bands. To put it simply this is pretty much an all-star ensemble a la 'Oceans 11, 12 and 13' but when it comes down to it, its just too much.\n\nI got rather bored with this listen and then the next and finally gave up on 'Wages of Sin'. I can name you dozens and dozens of bands who sound the same, play it the same everything the same. I just hope that as the melodic sound progresses it finds new territory to invade and conquer for its fine music but just not very deep.\n",
        "\nI have to admit that this album isn't as bad as 'Doomsday Machine'. It's still terrible and I don't recommend you buy it at all, but it is better than the previous one. Of course, farting in my own mouth is better than 'Doomsday Machine' so I guess it's not saying much.\n\nEssentially I'd describe this as the best you can possibly do with the elements found on 'Doomsday Machine'. Gothenburg-derived guitarwork laced with Machine Head groove, annoying mock-ferocious vocals from that retarded chimp Gossow, and generic drumwork, all tied up with the bow of painfully sterile and clean production. There's almost nothing to recommend for it except that it's 'not that bad'. Again, it's better than 'Doomsday Machine'. The guitars are kind of catchy from time to time, there's some decent riffs that don't repeat themselves for minutes on end, and the lyrics aren't quite as awful as the previous release. There are good moments on this record.\n\nBut really let me remind you that it's still an awful piece of crap. The Amott brothers haven't been generally able to write a riff to save their lives in a decade now and the trend isn't bucked particularly hard here. The vocals still suck and the music in general is as monotonous as ever, and only the most diehard fans of crappy throwback groove/Gothenburg stuff will find anything of value here. There's no point to listen to something like this when there's infinitely better melodeath IN THE SAME COUNTRY as this band. Really, the only thing that 'Rise Of The Tyrant' has going for it is that it's not quite as painful as 'Doomsday Machine'. Aside from that, it's just terrible.\n\nDon't listen to this, don't buy it, don't think about the band, don't let Angela Gossow open her mouth under any circumstances, she's an embarrassment to us all. Actually the whole band is, let's find a pit to bury them in.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy is a pretty good death band. They have had two good albums so far. That is \"Wages of Sin\", and \"Doomsday Machine\". Both albums inquire fast guitar work, insane and impressive drum beats, and death growls from Angela Gossow. Which is my opinion is a descent vocalist. This album has more impressive and challenging songs than Doomsday but both albums are good solid CDs.\n\nChristopher Amott and Michael Amott have always shown use their insane guitar work and impressive solos. In every song they have they solo and I must say each one is different and challenging. Both of these musicians can\u2019t get much better. In the song \"Burning Angel\" they have a very intense and catchy guitar rift that I must say caused me to like the band more than I already did. This band is very impressive all around and these brothers cannot get much better, but it\u2019s for the better.\n\nDaniel Erlandsson has influenced me so much as a drummer he is the main reason why I love this band. His drum work is very intense and fast paced which is what a drummer needs to do. He can play drum solos very well like in many songs on this album. He has also been in many other bands I enjoy like \"Carcass\". In my opinion he does a better job in this band and I believe he is the best drummer for Melodic Death/Gothenburg of all time.\n\nAngela Gossow is a very impressive vocalist. I really don\u2019t understand how that deep death growl comes out of someone like her. It really catch\u2019s your attention when you hear that a female sounds like she does. I hope she continues with her impressive deep emotional growls and continues to make the band unique and interesting.\n\nThe one thing I would have to fix with this band is the fact that some songs sound the same and others sound completely unlike them at all. For those songs that are impressive and talented keep working out those kinks I know this band very well and love what they have produced so far.\n",
        "\nPeople have been loving this album a slightly ridiculous amount. Sure, it's a step up from Anthems of Rebellion, but so is a recording of me farting in a tin can. I actually found Doomsday Machine to be surprisingly good. Not magnificent, but solid and replayable, so I would never consider it a failure. Arch Enemy's latest offering, 2007's Rise of the Tyrant starts off as easily their best work since Black Earth, but quickly descends into the utter bullshit that they have become known for.\n\nTwo of the biggest ticks that have been stuck to Arch Enemy's ass since the turn of the millennium are repetition and stagnation. A good chunk of their Gossgow material has this irritating tendency to repeat the same hooks over and over and over again until I start to look for solace in the sweet release of death. The track Revolution Begins exemplifies this so well it's almost frightening. It has this strange, glossy, happy, almost innocent tinge to it, and the melodic chorus hook is repeated ad fucking nauseum. And even if a song has a smidge of originality, it'll most likely be at the beginning of the record. Why? That stagnation I was talking about, that's why. The first two tracks, Blood on Your Hands and The Last Enemy, rank as two of the best songs the band has written since the nineties. Yet, the rest of the songs on the album rarely deviate from the style established by these first two, so why did I give this such a crappy score? Because it gets boring. The Bohemian Rhapsody is a great song, but if Queen would've recorded ten other songs just like it, the album would blow goats barring that track. This is exactly what Rise of the Tyrant manages to do. And even the songs that attempt something different (I Will Live Again) do it very very wrong and actually make me pray for more unoriginal melodeath.\n\nNow with that said, those that are either new to the style or militant followers of the Swedish melodic death metal scene will love this. The two opening tracks and the title track are pretty much my favorite melodic death metal songs as of now, and I'm not even a huge fan of the genre, so that has to mean something. But for nearly everybody else, the startling amount of rehashes and plain blandness will get on your nerves pretty quickly. Songs like In This Shallow Grave are above average when taken out of context, but when put on this album, they are completely unmemorable. Stuff like Night Falls Fast and I Will Live Again are pedestrian and bland, a combination that only infuriates me even more. \n\nMaybe I wouldn't hate this album as much if it didn't have qualities like the Amotts' incredible leads or furious and interesting drumming. The parts when the double bass kicks it into overdrive are extremely enjoyable and I don't think there is even one lead or solo that isn't in the top fifteen percentile of leads and solos that Mike and Chris have ever written. Maybe it seems odd that I'm commending an album for having really, really good aspects, but then at the same time condemning it for the same thing. I do this because it's frustrating. It's like snack time at my old babysitter's house. Sometimes I would get macaroni and cheese with hot dogs in it, but other times I would get pickled pig's feet (no joke). So did I learn to anticipate snack time because sometimes I got good stuff, or did I learn to despise it because of the possibility of the nasty shit I had to eat? This album is exactly the same, for every juicy lead, there is a dry and tasteless riff that is repeated four times more than it needs to be used.\n\nAnd throughout this whole deal, I have yet to mention Angela's vocals. Since it seems to be law to make a special mention of her in every Arch Enemy review, I'll just say that this is probably her best performance. As sedated and mechanical as she sounded on Anthems of Rebellion, here she is equally furious and crazed. The only time she ever sounds like absolute shit (which happens at least once an album), is on the inexplicably popular track Revolution Begins.\n\nIn the end, if you can look past deja vu like the opening to Vultures and the like, you are likely to find a brilliant record. If you have an IQ above sandpaper, you'll realize that there is very little here that you haven't heard a million times before. Blood on Your Hands, The Last Enemy, and Rise of the Tyrant are all exceptional tracks and are easily the highlights of the record, seamlessly fusing the melody and intensity the way melodic death metal really should be. Everything else is either rehashed or shamelessly commercial and completely lacking in balls/integrity.\n",
        "\nAlot of things have been written since 2001 when former singer Johan Liiva left Arch Enemy, most of them negative. With his replacement came the criticism, as he was replaced with none other than a woman who had only known Michael Amott briefly by interviewing him and giving him a rough demo videotape of her performances. In Amott's words though, she wiped the floor with the rest of the other singers who tried out for the lead role. Even though it came from left field in perspective, Angela Gossow does fit perfectly into the scheme of the music and brings something else no one else besides maybe Karen Axelsson from Sonic Syndicate can and that is beauty with brutality.\n\nThe sound of police sirens emerge on \"Blood On Your Hands\" and the band kicks into a frenzy just as quick as it ceases. What amazes me here is being a first time listener to Arch Enemy the way that Angela Gossow does fit into the music, as her death growl is almost on par with her male counterparts. If you didn't know she was female, it might take you by surprise. The song itself goes from a very fast pace to a beat oriented chorus and back again. Keeping it in the same arena, the band follow up the opener with the same ferocity and pace with \"The Last Enemy\" but slows the pace down in certain spots with more melodic guitar work, including an acoustic guitar outro. With \"I Will Live Again\" the band take it down a couple of notches for the entire song, incorporating the use of samples and slower tempo, melody based guitar work, but quickly pick it back up with \"In This Shallow Grave\" as it seems the band wanted to give the listener a breather of sorts. By now you're sort of realizing the whole gist of this album. As Rise of the Tyrant's vocals are more on line with the political stances of other metal groups such as Megadeth or atleast that is how I perceived it after reading several of the lyrics in the album booklet and double taking at the album name and song titles. On \"Revolution Begins\" the band pull it all together to make their album \"anthem\" so to speak (or the song that stands out the most as what could be used for commercialism.) The song itself is a pretty cool song and so is the video. Even though I'm a sucker for the more \"mainstream fodder\" type songs, this still carries the essence of all that is Arch Enemy in it, with solos by Michael Amott and the attributes the opening part of the record to this point carries.\n\nAltogether this album contains alot of things that separate this band from others in the genre. I love the musicianship of the band as a whole, as they work as tight as anything I have ever heard and even though it's hard to admit, females can sing almost on par with their predecessors in the sub-genre. I think what catches me the most about this album is the way it flows together so seamlessly, almost effortlessly and yet it's a solid album throughout. Much like the Demon Hunter album Storm the Gates of Hell, it's hard to really dissect the album and pinpoint any place on it that didn't really fit. The only one thing I am kind of against and call me whatever, but I just don't like \"interlude\" type tracks as it could be replaced so easily with another track of more magnitude. All in all though, this is a solid effort and well worth the money.\n",
        "\nI really shouldn't like this, but I do. This whole genre is complete crap and I can't stand any of the bands in it. At the Gates, In Flames, Dark Tranquility they are the popular things in Sweden it seems as of the past decade. Quorthon must be rolling over in his grave. Anyway, for some reason Arch Enemy does something all the other bands of the genre can't do: not make me puke.\n\nAlright, you get it. I hate Gothenburg much like others that have written reviews here, but what about Arch Enemy? Well, this band actually has a riffs and catchy melodies that don't come off as faggishly repulsive as other bands of the genre. Not to say the band doesn't have their flaws though.\n\nI'll start with the good. \n\nThe band can craft some catchy riffs, speed or thrash riffs will dominate the verses, occasionally with the second guitar playing 3rds along with it giving it that Gothenburg sound and usually some kind of power metalish riffs under the solos. Check out the intro riffs for Heart of Darkness and Dead Bury Their Dead or the verse riff to Ravenous. You'll see what I'm talking about. The lead guitar is quite spectacular. The Amott brothers are quite excellent and creative with their leads, sadly not so much with the goofy melodies that the genre cannot just do correctly. The drummer is actually quite restrained, backing the riffs for a nice powerful sound. He never resorts to overplaying, but relies on double bass a bit too often. Angela is not bad at all. I hear people bitch and moan about her and I can't see why. Most of those that praise her are mainly looking at her tits and those that dislike her usually just dislike her because she replaced and inferior singer and they're just homosexual or something. I'll take the middle road and say I think she's got a decent set of melons....err...pipes.\n\nNow the bad.\n\nWell, the production of course has that modern feel to it. Some of the choruses are atrocious. Heart of Darkness may ride that killer intro riff, but man is that chorus about as awesome as a bowel movement. \"Behind the Smile\" is just a really bad song. This band should never go slow to be honest. usually the fast stuff is pretty good, but the slow stuff is really hard to listen to. Savage Messiah is another example of this. Good verse and prechorus riffs especially the slight build up with the keys, but then falls completely flat at the chorus. Then there is the bad harmony thing that all Gothenburg bands fail at. Burning Angel actually has a good riff in the chorus, but the random goofy melody they like to do is really bad in this song. This problem pops up every few songs, and becomes a bad staple in every song on the rest of their albums.\n\nHighlights: Ravenous for sure and Dead Bury Their Dead. These two actually slay the whole way through, no parts that make me cringe.\n\nShould I recommend this? Well, fans of the style I'm sure cream over it, but this band really isn't that bad and I found a lot of parts quite enjoyable. Probably the best band in this genre.\n",
        "\nHomoeroticism has featured regularly in the sausage fest that is death metal. Something about a group of suburban-bred men attempting to be \"bone shattering brutal\" is amusing. However when a woman enters this world who isn't Jo-Anne Bench your run-of-the-mill death metal fan feels a little threatened. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to say Angela Gossow is amazing but she isn't quite as terrible as many would say, as their opinion is hardly objective. Quite frankly this is not an unmitigated disaster of an album.\n\nThis is a hard album to sum up; it has exceptionally good moments and mediocre moments, not really any terrible ones. In terms of instrumentation the album is sound and tight, Michael and Christopher Amott are clearly in a different league to most guitarists around, the tone of the guitars at times is incredible, however there are times when the guitars lack any kind of drive or purpose.\n\nDaniel Erlandsson is the one who brings all of this together, although his beats are not hugely original they are solid and work well with what is happening, occasionally pulling off a fill which jumps out at you. D'Angelo reinforces this solid backing. Although in metal you rarely get an interesting bassline, the bass is effective in this album is still effective.\n\nAngela's vocals are reasonable, she is certainly not the best extreme metal vocalist but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still reasonable and fits the style. There really is nothing wrong with melody in death metal in fact it adds another dimension here as opposed to the album pounding its way through endless blast beats.\n\nThe problem with this album is inconsistency, there are the obvious classics like \"We will Rise\" but also less rated song like \"Leader of the Rats\" which are also good. But there are then songs like \"Despicable Heroes\" which are really there to pad it out.\n\nAnthems of Rebellion is a good album but not a great album, certainly not as good as Black Earth but still better than Doomsday Machine. There really is little wrong with this.\n",
        "\nI've listen to Arch Enemy in the past, however I always hated Liiva's pathetic attempt at vocals, so I never listened much. Their previous works with Angela were good, however her vocals weren't that much better (at least they're harsher and more fitting) and the music seemed slightly... Well, boring. Now along comes Rise of the Tyrant, and I must say I'm blown away. \n\nMichael has started using Randall amplifiers, and his tone is huge and in your face. The guitar playing on this album is fantastic, maybe more melodic than their previous efforts, however that is what Arch Enemy is - a blending of beauty and brutality. Angela has greatly improved her vocals, now fitting excellently with the rest of the music. As far as the music itself, I would give it a 95-100. I listen to it constantly.\n\nEvery album has it's weak points, and this is no exception. The drums are far too quiet. Blasting it in my car, I hear guitars and vocals galore, and even the bass is definitely present. However aside from the high-hat, the drums seem almost absent. It's as if someone turned the volume knob down or something. Also, maybe this is just me, but the song \"Revolution Begins\" sounds kinda 80s-esque, especially during the verse.\n\nPoor mixing not withstanding, this is an excellent melodic death metal album, in my opinion one of the best ever. Many so-called melodic death metal bands play typical death metal, complete with a cookie-cutter death growl and throw in a guitar harmony or two and consider themselves melodic, but Arch Enemy shows how to truly play the genre: fast and hard, but never sacrificing melody. \n\nBest tracks - #2 The Last Enemy and #4 In This Shallow Grave.\n",
        "\nWith the release of 2005's Doomsday Machine, Arch Enemy had left me pretty disappointed. Before then I had already heard Wages of Sin, Anthems of Rebellion, Black Earth and Stigmata. Doomsday Machine seemed so plain and repetitive when compared to the rest. Few songs stood out to me and most felt like they had little effort or feeling put into them. Despite all of that, I was still excited to find out that Arch Enemy had released a new album while I had been away from home.\n\n\nI decided to pick up their album while browsing for others. I hoped that it would be something better than Doomsday Machine. So I got to my room and popped it in. At first, I wasn\u2019t very impressed. I was wondering if maybe they we\u2019re just going downhill. I decided to give the album a few more tries, and with every listen I recognized the riffs and solos a little better. I must have just been biased because of Doomsday, because I soon came to love the album.\n\n \nLike most albums or bands that I listen to, one of the first things that started to bring me in was the guitar work. I couldn\u2019t believe how well done it was. It seemed much more like their older style, a newer Wages of Sin if you will. The way Chris and Michael lead from a melodic riff to a shredding solo is perfectly done. They seem to have the perfect mixture of technicality and melody in this album. For the solo lover, songs like \u201cIn This Shallow Grave\u201d, \u201cBlood on Your Hands\u201d and \u201cThe Last Enemy\u201d, are strongly recommended though all of the songs have solid guitars and display their tremendous talent.\n\n\nLater on I started to notice how well the vocals were done. I know many think that Angela could never live up to what Johan did, but I think the very opposite. She\u2019s much more dynamic and has more pitches than just one for every song. She\u2019s much more furious on this album and a lot rawer as well. With the effects cut out, she\u2019s able to show more feeling and avoid sounding like the actual machine on Doomsday. With harsher growls and higher-pitched shrieks, this album is definitely her best work yet.\n\n\nIt\u2019s pretty needless to say that this album has completely blown me away. 2007 has had a few gems, with this being one of the best melodic death metal releases. Arch Enemy has produced a darker and more polished sound on what seems to be a flawless album. This is definitely a step in another, better direction for Arch Enemy.\n",
        "\nThis is my first Arch Enemy album, so I won't be comparing it to any other of their albums. What I will be doing, is laying everything down bluntly. This album has some absolutely incredible songs, and the formulae are all there, but I must say this album sometimes borders on apathy and repetitiveness.\n\nThe high rating I have given this album is mainly due to flawless masterpieces \"Blood On Your Hands\", and \"Revolution Begins\", rightly chosen as singles for the album. Also high up in the hierarchy are \"The Last Enemy\", \"In This Shallow Grave\", and \"The Day You Died\", which all could be moderately improved, such as the former, which could have an more interesting introduction riff, and the riffs under the solos could be better and more fitting instead of just variating the main riffs, and so on. It sounds petty to point out such things, but if they rerecorded this in a few years and fixed the weak points, then this album would be absolutely perfect. I have noticed this in quite a bit of Arch Enemy's music, from listening to songs like \"Dead Eyes See No Future\" and \"Nemesis\" which, although they rule outright, they could be improved which would make that little bit of difference.\n\nThe skill is all here. The newly reunited Amott brothers shred furiously, almost in the vein of the master ripper Yngwie Malmsteen. The sweep picking after the bridge riff in \"Revolution Begins\" is immense. Sharlee's bass is very tight with the rest of the music, and Daniel's drumming, although evidently triggered, is spot on. Angela sounds less monotomous than she does on what I have heard of her older music, leaving out all of the double recording shit, and she sounds quite remeniscant of Jeff Walker (Carcass). But the lyrics in most places, are quite simple. In my views, the lyrics to opener \"Blood On Your Hands\" are the king point of the album where the lyrics are concerned. Also, in virtuoso closer \"Vultures\", she goes really high, as if to growl a falsetto, which is very well done.\n\nThe most of this album is memorable, apart from \"Night Falls Fast\" and \"The Great Darkness\" which I have listened to many times and can only remember that they were okay. What was surprising, though, was the title track. That, in my opinion, has to be one of the highlights or representatives of the album, but here, it is nothing special. It has a huge intro from some movie, and then goes in to a big wall of sound the way I'm concerned. Worth mentioning, though, is the mellow interlude \"Intermezzo Libert\u00e9\", which is a sub-three minute instrumental melodic-doom metal break from all the fast stuff. It is quite enjoyable, unlike many instrumental interlude songs, like Morbid Angel's \"Nar Mattaru\" from the album Covenant, Nile's \"Infinity of Stone\" from Ithyphallic, and Meshuggah's \"Acrid Placidity\" from Destroy Erase Improve.\n\nAll in all, though, this is a pretty good album. I would recommend it to anyone who wants an album full of catchy melodic riffs and killer solos.\n\nIf you want some taster material, download \"Blood On Your Hands\" or \"Revolution Begins\".\n",
        "\nLive Apocalypse marks of a combination of Arch Enemy\u2019s final stop on the tour for their 2003 album Anthems of Rebellion, which was also guitarist Chris Amott\u2019s last show with them for nearly three years, and three songs from a show they played on the tour for Doomsday Machine (2005).\n\nFirst and foremost, Live Apocalypse makes it clear as day that lead vocalist Angela Gossow was the right choice for them when they hired her in 2000, and that they are easily one of metal\u2019s best live bands. From there, it is quite tough to find fault with either performance on the DVD. Specifically, the fact that only three songs were included from the Doomsday Machine tour stop could be looked at as a drawback, but because 19 real songs are included overall, and Arch Enemy absolutely tore it up when they played \u201cNemesis,\u201d \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d and \u201cSkeleton Dance\u201d that night, it\u2019s rather easy to be happy with the selections. Regarding the show that was Chris Amott\u2019s last for awhile, the only way to find fault with it is to play the ultra nit-picky card known as \u201cwell, they could have played this song, that song or who knows what else.\u201d However, because Arch Enemy fired on all cylinders for while they played all 16 songs that issue becomes a non-issue right away. What\u2019s interesting about this performance though is that it shows just how crucial Chris Amott is to the band since guitar harmonies played by brothers simply can\u2019t be duplicated when anyone besides Chris plays alongside Michael Amott.\n\nWith that, any fan of Arch Enemy, at least those who like the \u201cAngela era,\u201d as well as most fans of melodic death metal in general, should enjoy Live Apocalypse very much.\n",
        "\nArch Enenemy had been waning since about 2003 when AOR came out. That record was alright, but considering it came out after the mighty Wages of Sin, it paled in comparison. The last record Doomsday Machine was not spectacular either, although not complete tripe. However with this year's Rise of the Tyrant, their WOS sound is back, and fans couldn't be happier, myself included.\n\nThere seems to be a cohesion here that was absent on the last record, maybe it's because of Chris Ammott's return to the lineup but there is an energy that was lacking on the last record.\n\nFor one, Angela sounds a hell of a lot better. From what I hear the band went for a a very natural sound, no effects or extra crap, so that is her voice, pure and simple. You can definitely sense that she's pissed and rocking out. Also her lyrics are not that bad, the revolution theme constantly being one of the band's staples.\n\nThe guitar tone is huge, walls of sound hitting the listener whenever possible. The leads are sweet, especially Chris Ammott,s leads which always have a bit of burn in them it seems.The drums are also huge, adding to the overall energy and tone of the record. Erlandsson also delivers a fine performance, this man is an extremely tight musician and isn't afraid to show his chops and compete with the Ammott bros and Miss Gossow for spotlight considerations.\n\nIt's the songwriting however which is most improved. Tracks such the opener \"Blood on Your Hands\", \"The Last Enemy\", the title track as well as the very Yngwie sounding closer \"Vultures\" all kick the listener square in the face and rarely relent. Gone are the boring tracks or the wankfests the band was starting to be known for. There is very little fat left to be trimmed on this record as the band went for an all killer-no filler attitude. \n\nThe band has basically just made Wages II, and I for one am glad they did. This is an Arch Enemy I can once again appreciate.\n",
        "\nLove them or hate them, Arch Enemy have returned for the throne of 2007 heavy metal. Did they conquer the other pretenders for ultimate metal supremacy? No. Did they manage to release a sold slab of metal? Oh yes they did! Is this one of my favorite releases of '07? You better believe it. \n\nGoing into this I was not an Arch Enemy fan at all. I thought \"Wages of Sin\" was a neat album, but \"Doomsday Machine\" left a very bitter taste in my mouth with so many throw away tracks it made Lamb of God's \"Sacrament\" look like a \"best of\" release. When \"Blood on Your Hands\" was released to the public I had an apathy attack and was bitterly reminded of \"Doomsday Machine\". When I actually listened to the song though I saw the my judgement was hasty indeed. Blaring sirens start the track off and I knew I was in for a ride. All I could say was, \"Finally, they got it right\".\n\nThe trademark Amott wall of guitars is certainly present in this opener and wailing solos are most definitely the order of the day. The drums are little less extreme this time around and unfortunately the bass takes a backseat (as usual). And then there's Angela. Oh, sweet Angela. Say what you will about her, I think she's brilliant. Wheather she's calling for a revolution or just spitting out lines for the hell of it, her reptilian voice certainly gets it point across. \n\nDespite the very minor flaws of \"Blood on Your Hands\" I ran out and got the album and was definitely in for a surprise. Songs like \"The Last Enemy\" and \"Rise of the Tyrant\" (the heaviest song on the album) are instant classics in the Arch Enemy catalog and the entire album itself just has a much more consistent feel to it. Throughout the entire disc the guitars rarely let up with some very memorable solos and melodies, the drum fills are superb and the bass...well it's still pretty much in the background. I didn't say it was completely consistent. \n\nThere are still hints of the experimentation that ran rampant on \"Doomsday Machine\" as well. But unlike \"Doomsday Machine\" the experimentation this time around doesn't hinder the overall feel of the album. \"I Will Live Again\" features a very haunting opening melody that is the basis for which the riffs are constructed around. Not a good idea on paper but the melody is actually very good and I find myself going back to that track just to hear it. \"The Great Darkness\" also features so apocalyptic choir work which is nice, but at some points doesn't match up with the song so well. \n\nDespite my great praise the album does have a bit of \"been here, done that\" syndrome towards the end and the last track isn't memorable at all besides the soloing. \n\nThis album does absolutely nothing different or revolutionary, but that doesn't mean that something that has been done before can't still be done well. This is a good album and probably my most pleasant surprise of the year. It has great solos, awesome vocals, and is just flat out heavy. Isn't that what metal is all about anyways? Buy this album. \n\nStand out tracks: \"Blood On Your Hands\", \"The Last Enemy\", \"I Will Live Again\", \"Rise of the Tyrant\"\n",
        "\nAfter the rather dissappointing release in 2005 of 'Doomsday Machine' which was littered with double vocals and boring riffs, Arch Enemy need an album that returns to their original sound, shows their true creativity, shows their true brutality.\nThis is that album, and hell it's good.\n\n\nThe first track, Blood on Your Hands, was released via Myspace and their Century Media account a couple of month before the album release, and has been eagerly listened to by fans all over the world. The track is openly brutal, with a blisteringly fast riff, supported by fast, pounding, technical drumming that is perfectly executed. Angela's vocals were a major issue last album, but this clears any theories that she's only capable of double vocals, her roar is the strongest I've heard, it has a lot more voice to it than previous albums, and thus conveys a lot more of the emotion she's trying to get across, every time I hear the gutteral 'Remember!' on this track, it makes me shiver!\n\n\nThe Last Enemy is even more brutal than the track before, it's like a wall of metal hitting you in the face when this track kicks in, with it's machine gun-like double bass drumming and fast riffing. \n\nThe other notable songs on this album include I Will Live Again, which is alot more melodic than the other songs on the album, perhaps showing that Arch Enemy are taking into account the popularity of the old style of the original albums such as Stigmata and Burning Bridges. Revolution Begins is to be a single and video, and you can see why! It's a straight up fight song, and will be a lot more appealing to wider audiences, without displeasing the original fan base. Intermezzo Liberte, the album's instrumental, is quite frankly, epic in style. If there's any one song that makes you want to raise a lighter (or mobile phone these days...) into the air, it's this one.\n\n\nSo, Arch Enemy have returned to their original sound, there isn't a bad track on the album, and Angela has done marvels with her voice. So why haven't I given it 100%? There's some issues with the production on this album, for some reason the drums are mixed so that the snare is barely audible at times, buried beneath a wall of double bass barrage. This is something that the old albums suffered from, when Arch Enemy returned to their original sound, they apparently killed the snare again. The guitar sometimes sounds either too powerful, so it comes out as a big ball of fuzz, or too thin, so the solos don't quite have the impact they should do, even if they are written and played perfectly by two extremely talented individuals. And the bass is also buried underneath everything else that is happening around it, until it's just a background hum.\n\nBut these issues don't distract from the talent of the album, this is my favourite Arch Enemy album to date, and one thing's for sure. They're back.\n",
        "\nI don't believe this...I'm actually panning an Arch Enemy album. And I am sorry to say that this particular one deserves it. \n\nThe production is too weak, for starters. Like on Dimmu Borgir's recent album, Daniel's snare is buried beneath a flotilla of annoying triggered kick drum activity. Does Fredrik Nordstrom not like drums anymore or something? It sounds that way if this is any indicator. The guitars do have some presence and bite, and the bass is still nice and distorted, though buried more than it's been in the past. Disappointing factor to say the least. It only adds to the weakness and lack of impact on this album.\n\nThe music? Uninspired and they sound as though they're going through the motions on this album. Another reviewer mentioned evidence of rehashing songs on their part, and they're right: \"Blood on Your Hands\" is a pallid retread of \"Enemy Within\" and \"The Last Enemy\" is \"Ravenous\" all over again, only lacking the rabid intensity that made that song special. The riffs are tired and not as catchy as what the Brothers Amott have written before. Even the leads aren't as passionate as before, a VERY bad thing in the AE universe. The overall lack of enthusiasm on this album is upsetting. The only positive thing I can say here is that at least they seem to have jettisoned the stomp rock Ozzfest trappings on this album. But unfortunately at the cost of re-visiting a sound they've outgrown, the old style of melodic death metal they helped pioneer. \n\nIt was a chore listening to this album, much as it was trying to find redeeming qualities about \"In Sorte Diaboli\" earlier this year. Even after several listens, I was throughly unimpressed. And I am sad to say that. I know AE can do better than this, they have before. Therefore, I will chalk this up as a failure and only hope that they get the riff machine going again next outing as well as re-examining where they are, where they want to go, and whether they can bother to put out an album on a par with \"Wages of Sin\", my personal watermark for AE albums, again. \n\nI suspect there is burnout setting in in the AE camp, if this album is any indicator, and either a break or a breakup is a solution to this. If they keep releasing sub-par efforts like this, maybe the Ozzfest crowd will like it, but I won't be bothered to continue supporting them. And it pains me to say that.\n",
        "\nI was very critical of Arch Enemy's last album...I thought it was experimental and mainstream at the same time, but this time, its clear the sound is heavier, darker, and more intense, and the album definitely is much less mainstream.\n\nThe album is rather heavy, the riffs while they do have melody, manage to sound very dark, Angela delivery is a bit more varied and at times she sounds even more like a male. And the solos, Arch Enemy's albums have always been filled with them, but I feel like there are even more solos on this album and that they are very ranged and melodic. Now at first, I didn't like this sound, and thought Arch Enemy kept losing their direction, but I kept giving this album chances, and its probably grown more on me than any other album in recent listening...I'd say its a hard album to get or understand but once you do everything seems to connect and make sense.\n\nSome highlights? Well I love most songs on this album, but I'll focus on a few...\"Blood on Our Hands\" is a great opener, starts off with a fast guitar riff and the song explodes with nice drumming and an angry growl from Angela. This is one of the faster songs on the album, also one of the heaviest, Angela's vocals here are definitely powerful...the solo in this song is also fabulous...speedy, high-pitched, and ranges from high to low...\n\n\"The Last Enemy\" is a good song, also a fast and heavy song. Another intense and powerful vocal deliver from Angela. One of the solos in this song (there's more than one in most songs) is great for its thin but intense and speedy sounds...the other is more of a melodic solo. \"Revolution Begins\" is another good song, but it does sound more mainstream geared, with a slower pace, and the song isn't as heavy, but what it lacks for in heaviness it makes up for in melody.\n\n\"Intermezzo Liberte\" is a superb instrumental, I have always loved Arch Enemy instrumentals as they feature some awesome music, melodies and solos included. This is no different. We have a fairly nice melodic melody that starts off with acoustic guitar and slowly builds up with the heavier guitar and drums coming in. The guitar solo in here which takes up about a minute is also a superb one, it also goes from slow and melodic to a thinner but higher-pitched and faster paced sound before it slows down again. Very nicely executed instrumental. A lot of bands have instrumentals that really don't do anything for me and I see them as filler, but with Arch Enemy, they are just as enjoyable if not more than regular songs.\n\n\"Vultures\" is the last highlight I'll cover, and boy is it a song. At 6:35, it is one of the longest Arch Enemy songs and I enjoy every second of this song. I'd be willing to bet 40-50% of this song is soloing, and the other half or so is just as good with very nice dark riffs and brutal angry vocals from Angela. This song almost has a thrash feel to it, some of the solos have very strange, almost unpleasant melodies, but to my ear the strange sound is what makes the solo incredible, hell they remind me of some Kreator solos from \"Pleasure to Kill\"...just abstract melodies that are totally unlike what we've seen from Arch Enemy the past few years...overall an awesome song.\n\nAs for the negatives, there aren't many, but I find the intro to \"Rise of the Tyrant\" silly as its spoken. I also don't like the lyrics in part of the verses to \"I Will Live Again\"...I can actually understand what Angela is saying here and it sounds stupid, something about \"Is it me or is it you? Look in the mirror, who do you see?\", but this is really nitpicking, and I am resorted to pointing out these small faults, as I can't see any other ones...\n\nSo to review...More brutal sounds, my favorite Angela vocal delivery on this album, abundant intense and speedy solos, this album has it all. My favorite Arch Enemy album despite the somewhat different sound. I don't know much about Arch Enemy previous to \"Anthems of Rebellion\", but I dare say this album sounds a bit more like their older stuff, especially with regards to the solos. Wonderfully executed album, and if you don't like it at first, give it another chance, its a grower. After Doomsday Machine I didn't even want to listen to this album, thought they chose and would stick to their more mainstream and shitty gothenburg sound, but I was wrong. Hell this doesn't even sound anywhere near a regular gothenburg or melodic death album...\n",
        "\nIt seems as though with the last few releases in Arch Enemy's catalog (\"Anthems of Rebellion\", \"Doomsday Machine\") that the band had been experimenting with melodies, rhythms, and overall different approaches to their style of Melodic Death Metal. Despite their experimentation they have continued to garner legions of new fans without really ever losing their main fanbase. Yet, many wondered how their next release would sound. Would they continue to experiment or return to their original paths? With the release of \"Rise of the Tyrant\", Arch Enemy seem to have set doubters in their place with a return to original form but with a new found outlook at how to write it.\n\n\"Rise Of The Tyrant\" is darker, more sinister, and overall just more ferocious then any of the previous releases that feature Angela Gossow on the vocal duties. The band sounds in a better shape and mindset for the release of such a startling and enjoyable album. Fans of the original guitar dueling between the Amott brothers are going to get heavy dose of the brothers true art form on the album. Their combined efforts push the riffs to breakneck speeds and the leads to finger bleeding beauty as they swiftly and expertly trade off. To hear Chris Amott back with Arch Enemy is indeed a sweet relief especially after hearing the awesome chemistry that the brothers have on \"Rise Of The Tyrant.\"\n\nIt's always mind-boggling to hear Angela Gossow tear through the songs. Her ability to blend diverse and brutal vocals never ceases to astound me as she pushes her own limits on the album. Sounding even more pissed off than before (which is hard to believe considering her previous work) she strips her vocals down to their primal forms and lets loose a cannon of guttural roars that put most Death Metal vocalists to shame. Gone are most of the layered vocals which give the album a very distinct \"live\" and raw feeling that suits the band quite well for the release.\n\nDon't be afraid though that the band has de-evolved though. They may have reincorporated an older style to write this album but they don't forget the steps they have taken with their last few albums either. \"I Will Live Again\" uses a significant amount of synth lines in the song and a large amount of the focus is placed on the groove of the song. \"Revolution Begins\" is a catchy (and radio friendly) effort that really incorporates the lessons that Arch Enemy learned from their \"Anthems of Rebellion\" release. So expect a good mix from \"Rise Of The Tyrant.\" \n\nArch Enemy are at the top of their game with this latest release. And the entire band sounds as if they are on the same page for the first time in while. \"Rise Of The Tyrant\" is the best collection of music the band has created in years. Not to mention it's one of the best albums of the year in Metal.\n\nSongs to check out: \"Blood On Your Hands\", \"Rise Of The Tyrant\", \"Vultures\".\n",
        "\nThis is the first album by Arch Enemy I've heard, although I've heard a lot about them already - generally focused on the fact that they're led by Angela Gossow, who is one of the very few female vocalists out there who at least nominally employs the death grunt vocal style. I know the band has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them. Very little here persuades me to hunt out another album.\n\nMusically, the band as a whole is quite competent. There are a number of guitar riffs throughout the album - generally in the first five songs or so - which are genuinely catchy and inventive. The musical intro to \"Exist to Exit\" is particularly impressive, too. The drums here hang back just enough to keep the track moving a bit, while the guitars pull out a very entertaining riff, which then turns up as the backbone of the rest of the track. Many of the other tracks behave in a similar manner, but this is perhaps the strongest example of what I'm talking about.\n\nUnfortunately, the serviceable musicianship just isn't backed up by Angela's vocals. I almost get the impression at times that she's involved purely for novelty value, rather than because she actually complements the music. Firstly, I have serious doubts that what she's really doing could (or should) be described as a \"grunt\". It's a very rasping sound most of the time - apart from when she actually makes a grunting noise - which sounds almost as if she's trying for a rather half-hearted black metal vocal style. There's also a considerable degree of what I can only term a \"death hiss\" in her voice, which is an interesting idea but probably not one which really needs to be explored right here and right now.\n\nSecondly, Angela has the unfortunate disability that she simply can't seem to vary her voice consistently. Every single one of the tracks here features her rasping away in precisely the same manner, apart from the rare occasions when she drops her voice a few notes for no apparent reason. Now, I'll be the first to admit that even the best grunters out there are hard-pressed to sound inventive sometimes, but they at least have the advantage that they start from an interesting point vocally. While a \"death rasp\" and \"death hiss\" are both potentially interesting directions to take death vocals sometime, Angela's range is too limited for them to really work.\n\nThirdly, far too often she seems to want to sing over very different music. Most of the music provided for her here is actually quite \"bright\" as death metal goes, while her vocals would be much more suited for a darker-sounding band. On this album at the very least, Arch Enemy are not that band.\n\nTo give the band credit, they do try to avert the focus from her voice once or twice. The double-tracked vocals (Angela and clean male vocals) on \"End of the Line\" are moderately interesting, but the lyrics of that song are bordering on the inane by the time the new voice turns up. Hearing Angela rasp out \"You blew it/You knew it\" sounds almost cartoonish, since I'm sure it was the kind of thing we used to shout at each other in the school playground. \"Dehumanization\" features a similar trick performed more consistently, but the focus is still placed on the rasps.\n\nSo what's the 35% for? Well, the music isn't overly bad. At least, when Angela's not rasping away and I can hear the music by itself, there's a fair bit to like. With a different vocalist performing the same songs, I may even rate this higher. Unfortunately, for all the critical support she receives, Angela really is a liability for this band. Without her, they'd be a solid melodic death metal outfit with some good talent. With her, they really fall flat on their faces.\n",
        "\nWhen Arch Enemy decided to replace vocalist Johan Liiva with Angela Gossow back in November of 2000, many people thought bringing in a female vocalist was just a gimmick. Gossow soon proved that she wasn\u2019t a gimmick, but Arch Enemy just wasn\u2019t the same without Johan to a lot of long time fans, including myself. With Rise Of The Tyrant, I can safely say it\u2019s the best album Arch Enemy has recorded with Angela in the band, and also the best album they\u2019ve released since Burning Bridges. \n\nWhat makes this album different from their previous few albums (Wages Of Sin, Anthems Of Rebellion, and Doomsday Machine) is the fact that the band seems to have went back to their older style a bit. What I mean by that is more aggressive riffs, more subtle synth sections, and more catchy melodies throughout the songs. Doomsday Machine was filled with lots of crazy solos, but I thought it lacked on the melodies that the Amott brothers are famous for. There\u2019s no shortage of them in Rise Of The Tyrant however. The opening song, \u201cBlood On Your Hands,\u201d has one of the most epic sounding melodies I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s also the best song on the album, and one of the best songs the band has ever written. It would honestly fit in perfectly on Stigmata or Burning Bridges. I would just love to hear Johan come back and do the vocals for that song, but the chances of that ever happening are pretty nonexistent. Some of the riffs here and there will even remind you a bit of Heartwork era Carcass stuff. Those riffs are pretty few and far between, but it\u2019s still cool to hear some stuff like that again. Other songs like \u201cThe Last Enemy,\u201d \u201cI Will Live Again,\u201d \u201cRise Of The Tyrant,\u201d and \u201cThe Day You Died\u201d have really memorable melody lines as well. \n\nOne main reason I think this album is a bit of a throwback to their older style is the fact that the band went back to Studio Fredman to record with famed producer Fredrik Nordstrom. Considering the band recorded their first 4 albums (Black Earth, Stigmata, Burning Bridges, and Burning Japan) there, it\u2019s no surprise that this album turned out the way it did. The production on Rise Of The Tyrant is also very different than any of the bands previous albums, and especially different from their old albums recorded at Studio Fredman. The guitars have a huge, thick midrange crunch to them, and the low end frequencies are no longer overwhelming. More importantly, Angela\u2019s vocals are no longer drenched in layers upon layers of effects, which makes her sound significantly better. Overall the production is exactly what you would expect from Nordstrom, perfection. \n\nThere\u2019s really nothing negative I can say about this album. It does take a couple listens to really appreciate though. After listening through the first time, I wasn\u2019t really that impressed aside from \u201cBlood On Your Hands.\u201d After a few more listens I started liking it more and more though, and now I love it. There are no bad songs on the album, and there are more great songs than good songs, but I really wish every song would have been as good as the opening track.\n\nIf you\u2019re a big fan of Arch Enemy\u2019s older albums and have been disappointed with their material since Angela joined the band, this is definitely an album worth picking up. I\u2019m not saying this album is better than Stigmata or Burning Bridges, but it\u2019s definitely got the feel of those older albums.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy have always been an above average melodic death band. Not as powerful as Dark Tranquility but still not as watered down as Soilwork or new In Flames, you can count on them for several decent songs every album. Contrary to what the elitists say, they have not been in steady decline ever since Wages of Sin, since that was not really an amazing album to begin with. Anthems of Rebellion had simpler song structures, flatter riffing, less impressive drumming and a slight mallcore feel to it, but was not a major step down from Wages. \n\nThe aggression thankfully returns in Doomsday Machine. The rhythm guitars have been amped up, the solos are more intricate, and Daniel Erlandsson\u2019s drumming is much more varied. The vocal effects on Angela Gossow are a bit overdone, and her lyrics are laughably lame as usual (although the atypically violent ones on \u201cI am Legend/Out For Blood\u201d could almost fit into a Cannibal Corpse song). But she is still a strong death metal singer, far from the chick add-on gimmick the detractors like to claim. \n\nThe first six tracks on this album are solid, with the highlights being the speedy \u201cNemesis\u201d, \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d (complete with a melodic interlude) and the aforementioned \u201cOut for Blood\u201d, another fast track with blast beats that should be listened to from 1:20 on. The instrumental \u201cHybrids of Steel\u201d has interesting tempo shifts and lead work, while the chorus and power chords in \u201cMechanic God Creation\u201d are catchy. The rest of the songs aren\u2019t horrible but are generally filler and quickly forgettable. But overall, this album is very solid and rivals anything they have done in the past. \n\nArch Enemy may have openly admitted years ago to making their sound more accessible, but since this entire subgenre of metal is experimental by nature, the sellout cries should not be taken seriously. Having just listened to their latest and equally aggressive album, Rise of The Tyrant, it\u2019s clear that this band has not compromised their artistic integrity. And until the band amplifies the Anthems mallcore style or Angela starts breaking out into Anders Friden-style metalcore whining, I won\u2019t be convinced otherwise.\n",
        "\nI like Arch Enemy. I really do. You might even call me a fan. But I still have mixed feelings about this album. On the one hand, it is very monotonous. It\u2019s hard to differentiate one track from the next. On the other, there are a lot of catchy melodies and some OK songs. I\u2019d like to think this album is a step up from \u201cAnthems of Rebellion\u201d and \u201cDoomsday Machine\u201d but I wouldn\u2019t go that far.\n\n\u201cRise of the Tyrant\u201d is a bit like a less painful \u201cAnthems\u201d and a less diverse \u201cWages of Sin.\u201d The track \u201cNight Falls Fast\u201d on \u201cRise of the Tyrant\u201d uses a nearly identical riff to \u201cEnd of the Line\u201d on the \u201cAnthems\u201d album. This called to my mind Nickelback\u2019s song recycling. That\u2019s right \u2013 I just drew a comparison between Arch Enemy and Nickelback. Normally I would find something like this pleasantly nostalgic, but since \u201cAnthems of Rebellion\u201d was such a mundane release, it just makes me nauseous. You won\u2019t find much variety between songs, either. I can\u2019t stay interested when listening to this album. It\u2019s just the same thing over and over. The reviewer above me was right in pointing out that you\u2019ve heard this album before. Another strange bit about this new album is the use of choirs. They don\u2019t detract from the songs, but they feel really out of place. When I think of Arch Enemy, I don\u2019t envision creepy chants in the background. It sounds strange and unnecessary. \n\nOn the plus side, I really enjoyed a lot of the leads in the songs. Despite what we may think of recent trends, the Amott brothers are talented guitarists and I continue to enjoy their shredding, ear bleeding assaults. Angela\u2019s vocals remain strong on this album but sound different than usual. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it. She sounds more manly if that\u2019s at all possible. Did I mention the sleeve art was neat? Sorry, I feel like I have to say something good to balance out all the bad.\n\nIf you really love Arch Enemy despite their last two releases, then you will continue to love Arch Enemy despite \u201cRise of the Tyrant.\u201d Hell, you may even enjoy it. To those less clouded by blind devotion, you\u2019re better off avoiding this one or waiting for a sale. It\u2019s all been done before and Arch Enemy has taken a moment to remind us of that with their latest CD. Shameless riff recycling and ultimately boring guitars mark the core of this album. Angela\u2019s vicious screams and heavy doses of melody can do nothing to salvage what could have been a decent and fun album.\n",
        "\nCan anyone say experimentation? Presumably after the release of Arch Enemy\u2019s arguably pinnacle effort, Wages of Sin, the band probably just felt a sudden urge to move in a slightly different direction. It would be hard to top Wages of Sin at its own game \u2013 so instead of fighting fire with fire, Arch Enemy takes a slightly different direction with Anthems of Rebellion.\n\nReading the previous reviews of Anthems of Rebellion \u2013 it seems to me that many people don\u2019t like this album. Granted compared to Arch Enemy\u2019s previous discography this album is going to piss a lot of people off. So as a warning for listeners that love previous albums: this album is likely to tick you off. On the other hand, this is an amazing album for people just getting into Arch Enemy. As a starter album, this album really hits a few targets.\n\nThere are many areas where this album begins to deviate from the standard of procedure that Arch Enemy had become accustomed to. The guitar work has been simplified on many of the songs. The riffing is pretty standard material. There has been some distortion (a listener is going to find computer distortion quite a bit on this album) in the guitar sound on some songs although the solos are still very classic sounding. The Amott brothers are one of the best guitar duos in the metal industry (and at this time Chris Amott isn\u2019t with the band \u2013 a very sad fact). On this album much of the rhythm is written to be catchy rather than fast or heavy\u2026and it is. The guitar work is very catchy \u2013 part of the reason this album is a great starter point for new Arch Enemy listeners.\n\nThe bass and drum work isn\u2019t anything special on this album. The focus has been slightly targeted on song structure on the album so the bass and drums have been made a little louder and the song structure gives them a vaguely bigger role on the album. This is probably why the album is compared to \u201cnu metal\u201d quite often. \n\nThere has album been the addition of keyboards on this album. Just once or twice \u2013 the song \u201cInstinct\u201d comes to mind offhand. It\u2019s not a real big deal \u2013 although some reviewers seem to be making it a lot bigger then really it is. I think it gives the album a little more variety and helps give \u201clistener friendly\u201d melody rather than relying on the guitar leads. \n\nAngela Gossow spits venom. I shit you not. She is an amazing death metal vocalist and puts many of her counterparts to shame. Anthems of Rebellion finds her vocals becoming a little more understandable and she really gives the band the anger that makes them sound so sinister in the end. There is some experimentation that she does on this album. There is some distortion used on her vocals on a couple songs (\u201cLeader of the Rats\u201d is an example) and I think this is a useless experimentation. Her vocals are sufficient to the music and the distortion is really just a distraction. There is also a very surprising addition of a softer male voice in the song \u201cEnd of the Line\u201d that really added a whole new layer to the music that I really was getting into. I wish they would have incorporated more into the album while they had the chance to do so.\n\nThe lyrics are simplistic as is the style with Angela\u2019s writing. There isn\u2019t much detail being said in the lyrics \u2013 although most of the lyrics are very well written and hit all the normal metal subjects like hate, authority, battling falsehood, and empowerment. \u201cWe Will Rise\u201d may very well become one of the best empowerment songs for young metalheads world round.\n\nAnthems of Rebellion is a deviation from the standard Arch Enemy sound. There is a lot of computer usage to distort vocals, guitars, and keyboards. The writing has been simplified quite a bit but it has been writing to be very catchy. This allows a great entrance for newer Arch Enemy listeners. I believe this album is a lot stronger than many other reviewers have stated and even though the sound may have changed for Arch Enemy doesn\u2019t mean the album becomes a burden.\n\nSongs to check out: Silent Wars, We Will Rise, End of the Line.\n",
        "\nThe slow but steady decline of Arch Enemy since its inception (or, arguably, since the arrival of one Angela Gossow on the scene) is consistently one of the most depressing yet banal stories in the metal scene today. From their original height (above average melodic death metal), they've taken a dramatic turn for the worse over the years, culminating in a string of post-Axelsson albums that, shall we say, leave much to be desired. While when I had purchased this album I knew full well that it was going to be no tour de force, nothing had prepared me for the entirely new level of odium I was about to experience.\n\nIs this a joke? Really, is this a joke? Are we supposed to take this cluttered collection of half-baked concepts, littered with the remains of b-side metalcore riffing and melodramatic vocalizations seriously? Jesus, what exactly happened here? While describing Gossow-era Arch Enemy as brilliant would be a dramatic stretch at the best of times, they were certainly able to string a few decent songs together per album ('Silent Wars', 'Ravenous', etc.), but here they seem completely and utterly devoid of all the talent that they had expressed in their previous albums, leaving them a bitter, shrunken shell, a Gothenburg husk, if you will, of what they used to be.\n\nStarting off with the tepid instrumental 'Enter The Machine', the album doesn't seem utterly terrible at first glance; just dramatically uninspired and lacking the asskicking propensity of previous releases. But hey, it's just the first song, correct? While 'Taking Back My Soul' is pretty bad, we can't always have a 'Silent Wars' to tide us over for the meat of the composition, can we? Well, 'Nemesis' should quickly shatter any dreams you had of using superlatives such as 'decent' or 'mediocre' in conjunction with this album. Let us look at the stunningly introspective lyrics at work here: 'One for all/All for one/We are strong/We are one'. Masterful, to be sure, but I think it falls just short of, I don't know, 'Get low/get low get low get low get low get low get low'.\n\nThe album, of course, continues roughly in the same vein. Gossow's growls are particularly kitten-like on this album, the Amott brothers' guitarwork, while somewhat technical, fails to inspire even the slightest bit of emotion or power in the listener, despite the overtly slick and defined production here. Really, this album seems poppier and more accessible than anything they've done before. While attributes such as this are something that certain bands are able to pull off without seeming cheesy, not in this case: the half-riffing that fills 'My Apocalypse', with its weird, bleepy high chords followed by predictable E string chugging will prove that nicely. Drumming in similarly binary in nature; rock beat, rock beat, double bass, ignore. There's really not much more to it at all. Surely a disappointment for Arch Enemy that I fear they may never recover from.\n\nAvoid.\n",
        "\n(Note: Originally written by me on September 10, 2005 for Amazon.com)\n\nWithout a doubt, this is the best metal album to come out of Sweden in the melodic death metal field for a long time. The scorching solos, fist-pumping harmonies, vicious drums, and a superb production job make \"Wages of Sin\" quite possibly AE's best album, rivalled only by \"Stigmata\". \n\nThe Ammott brothers are absolutely impeccable. There is a great balance here in the sound. The precision is unparalleled in their intricate, meticulously-crafted harmonies and the INSANE shreddage on the solos. (It has to be heard, especially on \"Burning Angel\" and \"Ravenous\".) The trade-off allows both of the guitarists to have their turn to rip your head off. There's plenty of melody and catchy riffs here, but for the old-schoolers, \"The First Deadly Sin\" and \"Dead Bury Their Dead\" serve up some brutal, technical, and ripping thrash-fests. The clean guitars, while used sparingly, give off an eerie, dark atmosphere. (See the beginning of \"Savage Messiah\" for best example.) All around, an absolutely astonishing performance is given here. \n\nDaniel Erlandsson's drums are just as great. He may not be the fastest, nor the flashiest, but his bludgeoning double bass and full-throttle thrash attacks give the songs an extra dose of venom. He does have his technical moments, and even some minature solos. His fills are pretty crazy on \"Web of Lies\", and \"Lament of a Mortal Soul\" helps show off his fusion/jazz intricacies. A great performance. \n\nAnd of course, we have Angela's vocals. I actually prefer her over Johan, as she seems a bit more consistent and polished with her delivery. The lyrics aren't the best, but hey, they get the job done. (Even though \"Savage Messiah\" has some pretty good lyrics.) Her raspy screams and semi-growls fit the attitude of the songs perfectly. At times, she uses a frightening semi-whisper. Though she may not be the most dynamic vocalist and hasn't improved much on subsequent AE albums, this is more than enough to convince me that her vocals are pretty damn evil for coming from a blonde bombshell such as herself. \n\nEvery song has its own attributes that make it stick to you. From the deceptively calm intro of \"Enemy Within\", the variety of \"Dead Bury Their Dead\", (download this song to see what the album sounds like, it encompasses the whole album in one song and has some brutal guitar work in it) or the malicious assault of \"The First Deadly Sin\", all the way to the calming instrumental \"Snow Bound\", this will be one melodeath release that never gets old because of its consistency and variety. A highly recommended release to all metal fans.\n",
        "\nListening to this album is so painful for me. This is not because the album is very bad or anything, it's just that it should have been just so much better than it is. There are so many good points about this album, but after you listen to it you just feel like something in it is missing. This is also the case with the individual songs. As your listening to them you feel like you should love them, but for some reason you just don't.\n\n\nNow not all the songs are lacking on this disc. There are a few that are really good all the way through. \"Taking Back My Soul\", and \"Nemesis\" are two great songs that both display the melodic, yet brutal force that the band have shown on earlier releases. The riffs are very good on these songs. The vocals are still more or less the typical Gothenburg vocals, but they nonetheless are good. Another notable song is the epic Machtkampf. This is easliy the best song on the entire release. Great guitar, sick vocals, and some kick ass soloing. So songs like these show the capability of the band. \n\n\nSome of the songs, on the other hand, are just flat out bad. They are steaming piles of shit with no redeeming factors at all. Usually these songs are the slower ones on the album. Arch Enemy may think there being original by mixing slower tempos in to the songs. But they aren't being creative at all. All they are doing is providing painful songs that drag on and never go anywhere. When I say this I point my finger at the songs \"My Apocalypse\", \"Carry the Cross\", and the beginning of \"I Am Legend\". These songs are the main reason why I give this album a 60.\n\n\nNow for the songs that sound like they should be good, but in the end don't really amount to anything. These are instrumentals or the songs with very long insturmental breaks in them. As I sit and listen through these songs I think this should be kick ass. This should be a kick ass record, but it is definately not. This I think is really just because I have heard this stuff so many times before. Whether it was done by Iron Maiden or another Gothenburg band,I have heard this stuff so many times that I can't find any real enjoyment in these long instrumental sections. \n\n\nAlso the other really big problem with the album, more specifically the long instrumental breaks, is that this band has barely any rythem section. Everything is focused on the guitar. The bass does absoulutely nothing. I can't hear it the whole album. The drums don't do much either. And this is fucking Metal. In Metal the drums have to be great to be any good at all. These drums might work in like a Punk band or something, but not in a Metal band. They barely even double-kick. The rythem section does almost nothing on this album. \n\n\nSo in the end this is not a very good album. It's decent, nothing more than that. When your done listen to it you feel a weird feeling like there is something lacking in it. This is due to unoriginality, and the lack of a good rythem section. There are a few gems to be found on this album, but most of the stuff is very forrgetable, or just complete crap. Only buy it for $8 or under. I made the mistake of buying it for $15. There is much better Melodic Death Metal out there.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy have set the bar really freakin' high for themselves. Their albums with Johan Liiva (Black Earth, Stigmata, and the legendary Burning Bridges) are among the best melodic death releases ever, and Angela Gossow's debut (Wages of Sin) is WAY better than the more elitist types would have you believe. Then came Anthems of Rebellion, which was so bad by comparison that one had to wonder if the Amotts & Co. were running out of ideas. Thankfully, Doomsday Machine shows signs of promise and has a few killer tracks. This is not even half as bad as some would believe - it's quite good, really - and there's no signs of selling out (it's hard to sell out with death grunts, but not everyone seems to get that idea).\n\nHow about the songs that own on here? One word: \"Nemesis.\" Easily among the best Arch Enemy songs ever, it rips just as hard as their older material but still has melodicism for days. You can also tell that they're better songwriters now, because the transitions in this song are seamless (unlike the jarring verse-chorus shift in the classic \"Silverwing,\" for example). \"Taking Back My Soul\" isn't quite as good but still rips, in addition to featuring Gus G. on an excellent guest solo, which is something the Amott brothers never do. And then you have \"Hybrids of Steel,\" which is a quirky instrumental that really doesn't sound like any other guitar piece I've heard due to its odd scalar patterns; it's also supremely cool.\n\nThen there's the parts that are kinda frustrating. \"My Apocalypse\" signals the shift to a more industrial sound typical of the blander tracks, but it's actually a pretty cool song. I didn't care much for it at first, but it's sort of addictive after awhile and has one of the band's better solos near the end. Considering it's one of their more experimental departures, this is way better than \"Burning Bridges\" or the God-awful \"Instinct\" (from Anthems), but not quite up there with the awesome \"Savage Messiah\" (from WoS). \"I Am Legend/Out For Blood\" is also one of the better tracks on the album, but it's not very well-paced. The Legend intro is great but should be 15 seconds shorter, and the Blood half isn't that special (beyond being fast) until the synth interlude morphs into an all-out blastbeat and closes with just the right mix of string shredding and rhythmic power. \n\nThe Amotts don't seem to have as good of riffs as usual on Doomsday Machine, but at least the guitar solos are typically ridiculous. In fact, everyone here is playing out of their minds except for Gossow, who simply can't growl quite like she used to and won't be able to hide that with all the computer effects in the world. Don't get me wrong; I like her a lot and think she's one of the best in death metal when she's on it (her diction is perfect, and she has tremendous stage presence). But it's hard to say how long this band can keep going without getting somebody with less wear on their vocal cords.\n\nThe most surprising track of all - and the one that offers the most insight towards the band's future - is \"Machtkampf,\" which opens like a Beneath The Remains-era Sepultura song and keeps the old-school sound more predominant than usual throughout. Arch Enemy seem to be rediscovering the death side of their melodic death sound, which is hopefully for the better rather than the worse. There's no promises now that Christopher Amott has left the band, but Mike is still a legend and should be able to make plenty more ripping metal with Sharlee D'Angelo and Daniel Erlandsson rounding out one of the tightest modern rhythm sections out there.\n",
        "\nThe mixed reaction this album gets on here really surprises me. Musicianship from another planet, massive hooks, great melodies...what more could you want in an album? Okay, so it's not a straight-up thrashfest, and it's obviously very 80s influenced, but I don't see Arch Enemy ripping earlier bands off so much as paying them tribute. Burning Bridges is still very original, and would mark the turning point in Arch Enemy's career between aggression and catchiness.\n\nFirst off, there's nothing wrong with being catchy if it's done well, and this album does it better than almost anything. Looking for an anthemic chorus? Look no further than \"Silverwing,\" Arch Enemy's most melodic song and perfect for explaining to your not-so-metal friends what you're doing listening to all this screaming. Want to rip the paint off your neighbor's walls? Crank up the beginning of \"Demonic Science\" and feel the floor shake. Most of these songs shift around and change ideas a lot, and in ways more noticeable than, say, a slightly different thrash rhythm every half-minute. We're talking melodies getting stacked on top of each other and total mood shifts behind soaring solos. You'll find this stuff getting stuck in your head fast, but you won't object to it being there.\n\nThough Johan Liiva does a good job with the death vocals here (he would be replaced by Angela Gossow after this album), the real stars are, of course, Mike and Christopher Amott. This is one of the best overall efforts by a guitar duo to hit tape. It's not as shred-tastic as Cacophony, but it still rips, and these guys have a load of feel to their playing too. Mike, in particular, practically shows the Kirk Hammetts of the world that they know nothing about the wah pedal. Honestly, I will put Mike Amott's wah phrasing above anyone to ever use the effect, and his overall feel is better than most blues players. Chris is more of the straight shredding counterpoint to Mike, and he comes up with some great stuff too; that seriously awesome opening riff in \"Seed of Hate\" is entirely his work, as is the rest of the song. Anyone who likes good guitar playing has no excuse not to track this album down.\n\nThe only weak spot in this album is the closing title track. It's more straight doom metal than anything, and compared to the total melodic insanity of the previous tracks, it's out of place. The lyrics for it are also incredibly lame (not that you should be listening to this sort of thing for the lyrics anyway!), and it doesn't even end with a crushing final chord; instead, it stops like a vinyl record. Arch Enemy would later perfect occassional doom moments, as in the intro and interlude to \"Savage Messiah\" from Wages of Sin. But the rest of the album is so ridiculously good that this little experiment doesn't ruin it. In my opinion, this is Arch Enemy's best album and the de-facto starting point if you've never heard them. It's also one of the best melodic death albums ever recorded...no, wait, I'll go further and call it one of the best metal albums ever. Like the title of my review says, words can't do this justice. Go listen to this now.\n",
        "\nAbout a month after this album came out, a friend of mine who ran his own mail order pressed a copy of the CD on me, insisting that if I gave it enough plays the penny would surely drop. \"You're the only person I know who doesn't like this album\" he said uncomprehendingly. All I could do was shrug.\n\nMy complaint at the time was simple: I thought it was boring, very boring, and listening to it again now I see no reason to revise my initial opinion. On paper, Arch Enemy looked good enough. Michael Amott, one of the elder statesmen of Swedish death metal, and young prodigy Daniel Erlandsson on drums (who didn't seem intimidated by following in older brother Adrian's footsteps, and who had already impressed me with his work in Eucharist)... the chances seemed good that the mix would ignite. But for me it just never did, and for the life of me, to this day I can't understand why so many people rave about this completely uninspired, tedious and formulaic recording.\n\nLet me clarify something at this point. I see that most (all?) of the previous reviewers are a lot younger than me, too young to have heard the album when it was released and certainly not old enough to remember the context, or the history of Swedish death metal up till then. Some of you are possibly under the impression that this was a groundbreaking recording, that if it sounds familiar now it's because so many other bands have ripped AE off? This is emphatically not the case. As early as 1992 the Scandinavian scene was swamped with teenagers trying to copy Entombed and Dismember, and for every creative band (and there were a lot of those) there was about ten copyists. By 1996 this sound was already very old and familiar, and had been showcased on hundreds of different recordings. There is nothing new or fresh about this album whatsoever.\n\nAnd that's about the size of it, really... from first note to last, it sounds to me as if they were learning it from a textbook. There is not one original riff on the album, everything is entirely predictable throughout. \"Cosmic Retribution\" and \"Transmigration Macabre\" do stand out slightly as being the most committed and intense performances, but even then the music is just totally recycled. The acoustic break in \"Retribution\" is all very tasteful, but it doesn't seem to grow organically out of what precedes it - and on the other hand it's nowhere near unexpected enough to have the quality of a surprise. You just knew that there was gonna be a break like that sooner or later. I think the whole album can be summed up by the opener \"Bury Me an Angel\". It's a by-the-numbers mid-tempo thrasher, heavy Stockholm chords overlaid with occasional flashes of Gothenburg harmony, but a couple of minutes in, there's a bluesy guitar break. It has no musical logic of its own at all, says nothing and goes nowhere - there's not even a blues feeling to it. It's as if the riffs were constructed as shapes on the fretboard rather than sounds in the ear.\n\n[In fact, now that I come to think of it... what's Michael Amott ever done that I truly like? His arrival in Carcass coincided with that band's heading downhill as far as I'm concerned (fans of the band tend to divide militantly into \"early\" or \"late\" - I'm firmly in the former category; and let me say also that when bands talk about being \"influenced by Carcass\", as literally thousands are, they're talking about the OLD sound). It's true that I love the early Carnage demos, but that's more a question of raw power and viciousness than of the music, which is pretty basic stuff; even the Carnage album Dark Recollections, which was put together after the band was already a historical project, is pretty dull and repetitive - except for \"Gentle Exhuming\" which is simply two early songs stitched together. Dismember, which was basically the same band minus Amott, already sounded stronger. Clearly the guy has something going for him because so many people love his music - but I don't hear it. Admittedly I've never listened to Spiritual Beggars, but you can see why I haven't got round to it.]\n\nI am nearer 40 than 30, have been married for ten years, and don't listen exclusively to metal - so I no longer ask it to meet all my spiritual and emotional needs. Metal doesn't necessarily have to be immaculately produced or brilliantly played (which this isn't, by the way - it's perfectly competent without ever being out of the ordinary) to please me. But it DOES have to hit me in the guts, make me FEEL something, and the one fault which I won't overlook is that it should be boring. This album is really fucking boring! It's safe to say that most of you disagree with me and that newcomers are probably better off reading the preceding reviews, since apparently I just hear music differently from the rest of the metal world and am therefore not to be trusted. But it remains the case that metal is very close to my heart, and it remains the case that this album most certainly isn't.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy's \"Doomsday Machine\" certainly gets the job done. At some points it suffers from too many quiet or soft parts, but the overall makes up for it.\n\nThe title reflects its general (musical) theme. Except for few passionately crushing solos, the melodies are mostly melancholic and ominous. In fact, the only track that does not sound grim is \"Machtkampf\". The production leaves the instruments somewhat insdustrial, with the exception of the drums, which are clean, sheer and powerful.\n\nThe drumming kicks ass when Daniel Erlandsson is allowed to, as sometimes he is forced to play backup drums instead of playing a main part of the music as drums should. But as I said, when allowed to he cooperates perfectly with the Amott brothers in creating some amazing riffs. Several times the drums are given the main stage, as Erlandsson does not let down even here, proving an originality which many drummers lack.\n\nThe instrumental bits (Enter the Machine, I Am Legend, Hybrids of Steel) are noticeably different here from previous albums, as they are not simply hippie melodies but rather Rock/Metal bits. Though are not headbangable as most of the album (with the exception of \"I Am Legend\"), they are fine pieces of music.\n\nAs far as solos are concerned, I have no complaints. The Amott brother always knew to deliver the goods in the style only Arch Enemy has. They don't go cheap on them, yet don't go wild with ultra-fast virtuosi solos which show talent but not feel.\n\nThe riffs are pummeling throughout almost the entire album, not too fast, but heavy enough. The only problem, as I said, is that this is not completely metal, but rather the new style that is seems to be widely adopted of quiet/soft parts with vocals between the good riffs.\n\nMy personal favorites: Nemesis, Carry the Cross, Mechanic God Creation.\n\nAt overall look, the album is pretty good, highly recommended to contemporary metal fans and a must-have for Arch Enemy fans.\n",
        "\nThis is the Arch Enemy lineup that many fans wish still existed today. But gone are Johan Liiva and Christopher Ammott. However, this record showcases the first lineup, with simple and catchy riffs, simple song strucures and some very cool lead playing. This is how AE should have kept it. This album doesn't show off full on wankery, more like tasteful and skillfull playing by one of metal's top brother tandems. \n\nThe band was still pretty green, yet there is an undeniable intensity and authenticity about this release that appeals to me. \"The Immortal\" is a classic, a song the band still plays often live to this day. The main riffs and leads are great and the rythm is pummeling and worthy of the horns. \"Dead Inside\" has a nice intensity to it, \"Pilgrim\" has some ferocious riffing mixed with a catchy as hell chorus that inspires my head to bang. Once again the lead playing is tasteful and fits the tune really well. \"Demonic Science\" is another standout track with a ferocity so genuine you can just picture the dudes jamming in a crummy basement. \"Seed of Hate\" is another rocker. I'm a sucker for catchy and groovy riffs and this album has these to the brim. \"Angelclaw\" is a very melodic track, very reminiscent of what the band would go into a little further later on. The track gets to a fast paced tempo and the riffing is once again very clean and precise. \n\nThe vocals on the record are not outstanding. I prefer Angela Gossow's pipes myself, although her last couple of records have not been that good(although she can hardly be blamed for it!). Johan Liiva was pretty good and fit the band's sound on this release. He doesn't stand out but nor does he dimninish the record's quality. The playing here, especially on guitars, is spectacular. The leads seem so effortlessly produced and the Ammott brothers always have a very accurate touch on their respective instruments. The drums are also steady, but Daniel Erlandsson left his best playing for Wages of Sin. \n\nMy only real flack with this record is that the closing track is not very good at all. The title track is slow and boring and does not encompass anything of what the band's sound is about. This track did not belong on what besides this is a pretty good record. \n\nFor those who like to wave the nostalgia flag, this one's for you.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy are a very skilled band and they have proven it in the past. The first three records along with Wages of Sin, Angela's Gossow's debut, were a breath of fresh air in an oversaturated Gothenburg scene. The Ammott Brothers can shred with anyone and the whole band is extremely talented, but the last couple of albums have been disappointments.\n\nOn this record the band tried to concentrate on their chops, and achieved so with great ease. However, somewhere along the way the songwriting quality was affected. It seems the band has decided to slow down the tempo a little bit and go for a more mainstream metal sound. \n\nSome riffs on here are absolutely killer and there are some tracks such as the single \"Nemesis\" that smoke. But this record can kind of get boring after a few spins. The song structures are generic and Angela's vocals are disappointing at times. The days where we were all impressed by a female death metal vocalist are over now and the vocals are actually one of the weaker points of this release. \n\nNow, this record is not ALL bad. The guitar solos are awesome, the drumming is very clean and the band is supremely tight. The first song \"Taking Back My Soul\" is pretty intense as is the aforementioned \"Nemesis\". \"Carry the Cross\" is a slow headbanger with an anthemic feel to it. \"Hybrids of Steel\" is an interesting instrumental with very strange notes and scales. \n\nThe main problem with this is that it is generic and the songwriting lacked passion and intensity. However this is not a throwaway. It simply doesn't quite match their previous material.\n",
        "\nThe Melodic Death Metal scene seems to stray more and more from the Death Metal aspect in order to focus more on the melodic one with all its consumer trappings. Wage of Sin seems to epitomise this trend.\n\nHere we have an album where the only real connection to Death Metal is Angela Gassow's atrocious attempts at sounding like Jeff Walker from Carcass. Musically this is boring hard rock with the odd AOR and Mallcore influence thrown in for variety's sake. Worryingly, they also seem to be embracing electronic sound effects. When will people learn that keyboards and electronic effects have no place in Metal?\n\nThe Amott brothers really seem to have run out of ideas as the songs all merge into one another. This is not a good sign, as the album attempts to sell itself on catchy melodies. The intensity the band once displayed on Burning Bridges has totally disappeared.\n\nMichael Amott once slagged out Carcass' Swansong'. Yet on this album, he is doing the same thing that is, writing commercial hard rock with death metal vocals. Yet Swansong is brilliant while Anthems of Rebellion is stale and pathetic.\n\nSpecial attention has to be brought to Angela Gassow. As mentioned before, she tries to imitate Jeff Walker from Carcass but fails miserably. She is without a doubt one of the worst Death Metal vocalists to date. Yours truly is not averse to female vocalists, but Angela Gassow should never have been allowed to sing in a Metal band. \n\nThis is an album designed to sell to the horrifically commercialised American market. So if you like hard rock that pretends it is extreme metal, Anthems of Rebellion is for yours. But if you actually like Metal, avoid this one like the plague.\n",
        "\nDue to the vast amount of crappiness in metal today, I was hard-pressed to find bands that featured fast, technical guitar work. I had heard the Amott Brothers were some of the best in the business, and I was interested to see what a female death vocal would sound like. Thus I purchased Doomsday Machine on rave reviews from the press.\n\nSadly, (or maybe not so), it is impossible to truly know what female death growls sound like on this album, as Angela's vocals have computer effects added to them. The guitar riffing and soloing is there, but it doesn't really measure up to their earlier stuff. The riffs are simplified, as are some of the leads. Chris tears it up on the first solo in Nemesis, but really that's the only super-fast solo on the entire album. Most of the rest are more melodic, or else they are boring and do not add anything to the song. \"Skeleton Dance\" has a simple but effective 7-string riff, and \"Machtkampf\" has some decent melodic leads, but suffer from the terrible growling. The only two songs that are faultless for the most part are \"Nemesis\" which has guitar work that equals Arch Enemy songs of old, and the combination of \"Enter the Machine/Taking Back My Soul,\" the first half being a fantastic instrumental, the second half being a better-than-average melodeath song. One of the biggest detriments to this album are the vocals. Johan Liiva, for all his faults, was still one of the better death growlers out there. Angela's stuff doesn't add anything, and for the most part it actually hurts the songs. Some of the good melodies that the Amott Brothers think up are ruined. One wonders whether her contributions are positive or a detriment to the band. Also the lyrics are terrible, but they really aren't any worse than any of the other crap that Arch Enemy has put out over the years, and in a genre of shitty lyrics, I've almost come to expect choruses like \"All for one/one for all/we are strong/we are one.\"\n\nIf you can believe it, even with all of its faults, this is probably the best Arch Enemy album with Angela. That being said, this does not come close to \"Black Earth\" or any of the other albums with Liiva. This was a tossup for me whether to recommend this album for purchase or not, but now I'd say that this warrants a cautious purchase. But do not go into listening to this album with high expectations, for like I said before, this is no \"Black Earth\" and you will certainly be disappointed.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy seem to be settling into a comfortable niche for themselves, both a good and a bad thing. While this is a strong album with teeth all the way through as well as plentiful dynamics, there is an overwhelming \"been there, done that\" feel to it. For any other band this would be generic and unimaginative; by Arch Enemy's standards this is good but not great, rather like \"Formulas Fatal to the Flesh\" was for Morbid Angel. \n\nOf course, Rickard Bengtsson's production job and Andy Sneap's mix is stellar, adding the usual clear speaker-cracking tones to a solid release--though Sharlee's growling fuzz bass is not as prominent in the mix as usual--no complaints there. And as always, the Amott brothers crank out an impressive array of well-placed licks and well-constructed riffs with beautiful tone over Adrian Erlandsson's ultra-precise drumming assault--again, no complaints. Angela sounds as mean and angry as ever, albeit enunciating even a little more clearly this time around. It's the fact that much of the material on hand settles into a mid tempo rut, rather like Bolt Thrower has for the last 14 years or so. I appreciate that AE are trying to write catchy and memorable songs and they do a good job at it, but a little more variety for my taste would be good. That said, this is still an highly enjoyable album, and here are my favorite tracks from it: \n\n\"Nemesis\": Classic AE approach here; catchy opening riff and lightning-fast double bass drumming exploding into a chunky verse riff, flowing right into a memorable chorus that has anthem written all over it. And it works well, as only they can do it. \n\n\"I Am Legend/Out For Blood\": The first part of this is a bombastic and ominous instrumental that sets the tone for an all-out thrasher that even features the first blast beat AE have played in years. And they set up that part very nicely, too, leading into it with ease and perfect flow--it doesn't feel at all gratuitous. And the first half of the title also indulges Michael Amott's SF fanboy nature, as it references the classic novel of the same name. \n\n\"Carry The Cross\": Another great opening riff--the Amotts seem to have the market cornered on those--with some of the more creepy riffing the Amotts have written on the chorus and Angela spitting contempt over the lot. And another catchy chorus, to boot. \n\n\"My Apocalypse\": Midtempo all the way with even a little bit of pseudo-operatic vocals in the backgound, a real pounder this one is. \n\nAs far as lyrics go, Angela wrote the majority of them this go-round and does a good enough job. She's not as good at it as Michael is, but give her time, she will catch up quickly enough. I am totally behind Angela and I think she can do it. \n\nAs previously mentioned, this is a good, solid release and is not what I'd call crappy (like what I've heard of the new Exodus CD--I am NOT feeling that one, sad to say). It's just that I think AE need to bust out of this rut and start really shredding and stretching out beyond the parameters of their well-established sound by now. Safety is good but sometimes you have to throw it all to the winds and do something radical, and I think that AE's time to do that has come. Otherwise they will come down with \"Bolt Thrower Syndrome\" and start releasing the same album with different titles every year and a half or so, and they're too talented to do that, I hope!\n",
        "\nArch Enemy continues to be referred to as \"melodic death metal,\" though their music is much more melodic than death metal. The soaring guitar parts might turn off death metal purists, but to those willing to accept variety, they make the album more engaging to listen to. The drums bring the death metal aspect to the music with blastbeats. The vocals aren't extremely low as in most death metal, but are still harsh enough to add agression. In some songs (like \"Carry the Cross\") the vocals sound as if there are effects on them. This makes them a bit more powerful, but the feel is less authentic.\n\nThe lyrical theme of social decay and rebellion is carried on from Anthems of Rebellion into Doomsday Machine, but some songs on this album do have different themes. The lyrics are rather simple and uninspiring. There are random rhyme schemes thrown in here and there, and the occasional \"big word,\" but nothing really hits hard.\n\nThe track on this album most likely to become a sing is \"Nemesis,\" a fast and almost thrashy song addressing social rebellion. It is hard-hitting and intense on the first listen, but as one listens to it more, it becomes somewhat boring. On the other hand, \"Carry the Cross,\" is slow and rather unagressive. It takes several listens to really appreciate the power of its bridge and chorus.\n\nI would not recomend this album to die-hard death metal purists, or people who are easily bored. (Even though the songs aren't excessively long, they do get boring during the sometimes-dragging instrumental parts.) If you have the patience to listen to the album several times, though, and you have an open mind, you will probably grow to like this album.\n",
        "\nWhen Angela first came into the band they released \"Wages of Sin\" which was a decent album with a lot of melody, some memorable moments with a few decent riffs and some great solos. \"Anthems of Rebellion\" with the exception of 2 or 3 songs was basically typical melodic death metal with typical melodic death vocals from the singer Angela. They were a decent band that earned my respect, certainly wasn't one of my top 5 bands but they scored points with me in the past with songs such as \"Enemy Within\" and \"Dead Eyes See No Future\". I was certainly curious to see what the new album would be like.\n\nIn a way you could say I am surprised because of how the album turned out. Their theme, doomsday, also surprised me although I do have to say I like the album cover. The album starts off with an intro \"Enter the Machine\". The tunes on there are similar to typical Arch Enemy so no surprise there. A decent intro that could be enjoyable the first few times. What happens later with \"Taking Back My Soul\" surprises me. The first part of the song is definately solid with a lot of death metal riffs which were quite good, and the drums were also pretty fierce. I was almost thinking I was listening to Morbid Angel for a while there. Then after about 2 minutes the song goes back to melodic death metal with a lot of great melodic solos from the great guitarists, the Ammot brothers.\n\n\"Nemesis\" stays with the melodic death usual. It is a bit heavy and less melodic than previous albums with some heavy riffs and lots of heavy drum beating. However you still have melodic guitars and guitar solos so that keeps you thinking you're listening to regular melodic death and not plain death. Its not a bad song however the last few minutes of the end are just atrocious with some weird ass noise that sounds like a fucked up train engine. This should have been totally taken out of the song.\n\n\"My Apocalypse\" goes back to the death metal feeling with heavy guitars and great but rather heavy and less melodic riffs. Even Angela's vocals get much, much deeper so at times I'm convinced I'm listening to a guy singing. Overall, when she tries making her vocals sound more death metal-ish it doesn't sound too great. Once again about half-way through we get some melodic acoustic guitars and a solo and we go back to the usual melodic death feeling that we're all used to from this band. The song is still however one of the most boring and poorly done on the album even though they went back to their melo-death roots.\n\n\"Carry the Cross\" is typical melodic death on the start and then shifts to more heavy melodic death, I can't call it death metal because even though the guitars and drums as well as the vocals get heavier and darker, they are still rather melodic and I must say the two genres don't mix that well. The section around 2:25 is great though when for a few seconds they go back to the original melo-death and we get some quick but memorable melodic riffs. Around 3:30 we get some solos before going back to a mix of melo-death and death.\n\nI'm not going to describe the rest of the album song by song because I would just be repeating myself. Overall I don't like it very much, some parts are melodic death, some parts are death, and some parts are both and the two genres unfortunately don't mix very well. While there are some very decent riffs the riffs that follow it just don't equal up so eventually even the good riffs don't sound good because there just isn't good structure to support the better ones. Also there are a few well done solos in the beginning of the album, however as the album trends on the solos seem to deteriorate. Another problem I have is the vocals, Angela I think was trying to make them sound more dark, growly, and in effect more death metal like. This does not sound very well as her voice seems even more muffled and distorted than before. At some points they even remind me of Shagrath from Dimmu Borgir. The album is also repetitive with some riffs and solos towards the end of the album sounding very much like the ones in the beginning.\n\nOut of the past 3 albums this one is definately the worst. I say stop experimenting which this definately sounds like what they're doing and choose one. I have to admit that some of the death metal sections sounded very good and almost like bands like Morbid Angel as stated before, so I wouldn't mind them doing a death metal album either but when you combine the two it just sounds silly.\n\nGood luck with your next effort because this just doesn't cut it for me.\n",
        "\nArch Enemy released the album 'Anthems of rebellion' which met a general wall of frosty silence from the scene. The band who unleashed the venomous 'Wages of sin' had suddenly wrote an album that was just average melodic death metal, with very little in the way of standout marks.\n\nSo how does 'the Doomsday machine' stand up? Well the first you notice is that the band seem to have gone a lot heavier, some songs sounding in places like classic death metal, but overall the Melodic death metal influence is very much still in place.\n\nOpener 'enter the machine' is a simple two minute intro-instrumental, which leads straight into 'Taking back my soul' This song begins with a very tribal drum style and seems oddly reminiscent of a 'machine head' song, however once the scorching leads come in the song changes. Angela's vocals seem an attempt to go more death metal, sadly on this song they do not work. It's overall a decent song, with some good lead work from the ammot brothers. A solid start\n\nNext song \"Nemesis' begins in a way that totally tears your face off, sounding alot like early 90's death metal. For 2 minutes the song is a true face shredder but then... It gets repetitive, the leads slow down and the chorus of 'one for all...' is repeated a tad too much, had this been cut down by 30 seconds to a minute this song would be a new 'Ravenous', a missed opportunity but none the less a very good song.\n\n'My apocalypse' is a very dull song, extremely pedestrian and it goes nowhere, I'd use the term filler but it is too early in the record for that, so I'll simply call it crap.\n\nFollowing this is the song 'carry the cross' this is a very slow song by the standards and its lyrics are quite obvious from the title, all about the burden of society. It has some nice clean lead and somehow avoids being boring, with a clattering chorus that keeps the listener interested. But like 'Taking back my soul' it suffers from seeming far too inconsistent, dropping in places to the later era of bands like In Flames.\n\nThe double titled 'I am legend/Out for blood' Begins with a slow lead intro that goes on for far too long (80 seconds!) However after this it suddenly explodes into a real shredder, sounding not too unlike 'Morphing into primal' by IN flames, but with a faster vibe (including some blast beats midway through) and a guitar tone that is alot sharper. One of the few songs that really tears through you until the end once it gets going, shame they decided to play that intro for so long, had it been merely 20 seconds this could have been one of the best Arch Enemy songs ever penned.\n\nThe bizarre 'Skeleton Dance' begins with a nice dual lead backed by some odd whispering noises and laughter. Once it begins it has a fast and powerful vibe to it, kind of reminiscent of 'dead bury their dead' from wages of sin. But as the vocals come in it goes into its slow pedestrian mode again, with the only hint of innovation being an odd guitar technique that sounds like a screeching soul. This song overall feels more metalcore than their usual material, though thankfully avoiding the trademark dullness that goes with metalcore.\n\nInstrumental 'Hybrids of steel' s a very guitar driven piece starting with a stadium rock esque tone and rhtyhm. But once it begins the listener is treated to some lovely leads that are constantly slaloming between the Amott brothers, it is not a fast paced instrumental in the vein of say 'Urotsukidoji' by Testament, but what it lacks in speed it makes up for in its inventive lead structure, with solo after solo coming out over the top of an ever changing tempo. Somewhat an odd choice for an eighth track (where the filler usually ends up) but an interesting piece none the less.\n\n'Mechanic God Creation' is, I guess, the album's epic clocking in at just shy of 6 minutes. The intro is a very clear guitar piece that is slow and brooding backed by drums that slowly build up to a pace. However this song is one of those stop-start songs that gets boring, the only real injection of pace coming in the last 90 seconds or so, by which time it is too late to save the song, even with a nice set of leads and solos. Bit of a waster really, feels almost as if they have fused two sets of left overs into one long piece that simply does not gel at all.\n\n'machtkampf' begins with a drum intro that sound similar to 'rust in peace...polaris' by Megadeth before the guitars kick in right away to stop the rip-off chants from exploding. The sound of this is a very melodic death style but Angela supplies much more throaty vocals that give it a more death metal punch, while again the amott brothers supply a good set of leads that are often slalomed over the top of by Angela. The pace of the track is swift and agressive and has a real headbang beat to it. Almost an odd fusion of late 80's thrash and mid-90's melo-death. But it works, it fuses well and is genuinely one of the better songs on this disc.\n\n'Slaves of yesterday' rounds off my version of this album with a slower pace than the last track, yet again the use of early leads and solos supplies a good vibe throughout the first few bars of the song. But it then becomes a rather a boring riff and beat that throws more nods to 'the burning red' era machine head than the death metal gloryness of yore. Just over 2:30 in things change again with a nice lead that builds in volume and pace as the track goes on before ending with a set of sharp leads that tickle the listeners ears, but just as you think a speedfest is about to happen we are harked right back to the slow MH-esque groove geats once more, though oddly Amott slaloms over this with a classic metal lead, the result is messy and not very consistent. After this it returns once again to those slow beats and fades into nothing, signalling the curtain for this album.\n\nSo what does 'Doomsday machine' offer to the fans of arch enemy or to the newcomers? For the fans it offers many reminders of their ability to write some very feral and guttural music, yet worryingly it seems to show them in a 'fusion' light often melding musical genres that simply don't mix. For the newcomers it has an accessible sound, but is not as light or weak as 'Anthems' was. This sounds very much like the difficult progression record and leaves hope that the next will be a much tighter and darker unit. The whole doomsday theme itself is a surprise after the last albums theme of taking control and moving upwards.\n\nIN places this is a great slice of regression but it is hampered often by the good parts suddenly ending, being replaced by watered down bits for an age, and then the good parts returning before a sudden end. Also repetition seems a key theme on some songs and many of these could have been cut don by at least a minute. In essence this would have made the songs much tighter and the album then would have had a much more cohesive feel to it. As it 'Doomsday machine' is an album that will satisfy the fans and newcomers alike, but it is by no means a metal classic and severely unlikely to feature in any 'album of the year' polls.\n",
        "\nThis album features two of the world\u2019s fastest, most complex and talented guitarists. Heavy, thundering bass accented by pounding, precise drumming which even out the rhythm section. All topped off by a woman with the face of an angel and the voice of the Devil. This is Arch Enemy\u2019s Wages of Sin.\n\nThe guitar work on this album is second to none. The riffs come flying from the rest of the music on the album. The Amotts\u2019 solos perfectly add a new layer to the songs, standing alone against one another, as well as strong against solos from any other band on any other album. The album has parts where the guitars frantically spit out notes at top speeds, chug along very low and intimidating, create a softer and moving sound, make a creepy haunting vibe, and soar high majestic and proud. This is melodic death metal perfection.\n\nCompeting with the excellent guitar work is the remarkable death vocals of Angela Gossow in her first album with Arch Enemy. Quite honestly, as far as death metal singers go, her voice is incredible. While not quite the highest or lowest of all death metal growlers, she has a great range. From flat out screaming to a high, almost seductive, whisper-like sound to a low, impressive growl. What separates her from many other death metal singers is she doesn\u2019t have just one \u201cdeath voice\u201d. In many other death metal bands, the style of singing sounds the exact same on every single song, only with different lyrics. Angela, on the other hand, manages to handle each song differently, using varying nuances and inflections in her voice on every track. In Johan Liiva\u2019s absence, she has turned out to be more than a worthy replacement.\n\nNow, for those of you who are not death metal fans and are still reading, I\u2019ll say this to you. Even if you\u2019re not a big fan of harsh vocals, give this album a couple spins. It may take you a few listens to get used to Angela\u2019s voice, I won\u2019t doubt that. But, I also don\u2019t doubt that you\u2019ll be sucked into the technical instrumental work, while possibly being put off by Ms. Gossow\u2019s screaming. I know this because I AM a melodic death metal fan and that\u2019s how I felt about Arch Enemy at first. But hang in there; once you gain an appreciation for the music, an acceptance and maybe even enjoyment of the vocals could follow. Once you get to the point where you want to hear the Amotts\u2019 slam out a little guitar, you\u2019ll find yourself hooked. Just give it a matter of time.\n\nNow, back to the album. It begins with an array of songs that should be death metal classics. Not just Arch Enemy classics, but songs that should be included when making the death metal time capsule. Some of the greatest tracks Arch Enemy\u2019s ever recorded sit right up front on Wages. \n\nA deceptively calm piano piece serves as the intro to the album, lulling the listener in a false sense of security and peace. This peace is soon shattered as the guitars and rums of \u201cEnemy Within\u201d explode from your speakers. What it starts with is probably one of the best riffs ever laid on tape which leads a short, sweet and insane metal track that will either immediately make you want to hear the rest of the album or send you screaming into the night, unable to handle the metal overdoes. You\u2019ll then spend the rest of your poor existence listening to Kenny G records, trying to unwind and settle down from the metal madness. But, for those of you who managed to survive this first track, the best is yet to come.\n\nSome nice demonic overtones along with a chilling but catchy opening harmony are just a couple reasons why \u201cBurning Angel\u201d is one of, if not my absolute, favorite Arch Enemy songs. While not quite as fast as its predecessor, this track is just as intense. A consistent rhythm section, some excellent double guitar harmonies, Angela screaming her heart out and a guitar solo that could make Yngwie Malmsteen say \u201cDamn, that was pretty cool\u201d flesh out this awesome death metal classic.\n\n\u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d continues the album. Quite a bit slower than the last two, but a very complex song with several different parts and really takes advantage of Angela\u2019s range. \u201cRavenous\u201d is an extremely intense song, and was the first single from this album. It starts with some unusual riffing, but soon explodes into a fast-paced headbanger\u2019s delight with some pretty gruesome lyrics. It\u2019s the kind of song that makes you throw your devil horns in the air proudly, all the while wondering what the hell is going on inside their heads. All the while being sure this is a song that will be on their live setlist for years to come. Then, a more epic feeling comes from \u201cSavage Messiah\u201d, which is probably one of the few Arch Enemy songs you could say that about. From a slow, ominous opening, ripping into full metal fury, to a truly mighty refrain, this song is probably an example of some of Arch Enemy\u2019s best songwriting. Definitely a fine example of what Arch Enemy can do, rounding out the classics that open up this album.\n\nThe rest of the songs on the album each have their own appeal and have a unique sound. While not quite as good as the songs that kick off the album, each should still remain in the death metal hall of fame. There\u2019s the trudging, ugly, angry \u201cDead Bury Their Dead\u201d, with it\u2019s excellent drum work, time changes and bass lines. The excellent guitar licks towards the end of \u201cWeb of Lies\u201d make the track MORE than worthy of a listen. \u201cThe First Deadly Sin\u201d is an obviously Slayer-influenced track, with some classic speed-metal parts. While \u201cBehind the Smile\u201d starts very different, with a groovier, almost nu-metallic opening, this is just Arch Enemy branching out in a different direction and doing it pretty well. \u201cShadows and Dust\u201d is an excellent song, almost taking a page out of the Megadeth playbook (the main riff sounds suspiciously like \u201cA Secret Place\u201d), everything in this song works perfectly, from the catchy tech riffs, to Angela\u2019s screaming and the constant pounding rhythm. This is a song I\u2019d love to hear them play live some day. Finally, the album is laid to rest with \u201cLament of a Mortal Soul\u201d. What begins as a standard, catchy metal song is given an interesting touch with some unusual, seemingly misplaced guitar work during the refrain, but in the end it all works pretty well.\n\nSo, there you have it. In my mind, death metal perfection. You\u2019ve got a pair of metal\u2019s best guitarists doing what they do best. Writing excellent metal tracks and performing them as only they can. This is one of the few albums where I can honestly say I don\u2019t need or want to skip a track. Which is very rare for me to say about a death metal CD, even if it is melodic. I can\u2019t say it enough, this is an album that does everything right. From the piano at the beginning of \u201cEnemy Within\u201d to the last notes of \u201cLament of a Mortal Soul\u201d, this is a 90-MPH heavy metal roller coaster, with hills, valleys and even a couple loops. For those of you who are death metal fans, this is absolutely recommended listening. For those of you who aren\u2019t\u2026 this absolute recommended listening, it may even convert you to the darker side.\n",
        "\nAt this point in Arch Enemy's career they had released solid material that comfortably falls into the category of later-day Carcass with more of a Swedish death metal influence. The performance on Burning Japan demonstrates the impressive instrumental ability of Michael and Christopher Amott in particular, who have both shined on releases from a number of different bands as well. The leads are spot-on and the riffs sound as crushing as they did on the albums. One cannot count out the always reliable Daniel Erlandsson, who offers up a varied drumming technique for this style of music.\n\nTry as I might, however, I cannot understand how Johan Liiva makes a career out of being a vocalist. He fares much better on this release than on any of the studio albums, yet there is very little that distinguishes him from an average growler.\n\nAs for the song selection, each of Arch Enemy's albums receive fairly equal representation, with one notable exception. Where is \"Bury Me An Angel\"? This song is probably one of the most revered from the band, and its inclusion would have upped the score a bit. Regardless, this album should please any fans of the Gothenburg goodness that Arch Enemy always offers.\n",
        "\nIn 2001, Arch Enemy (AE) seemingly turned over a new leaf. For several years the band had been among the fastest, fiercest and most talented metal bands out there. They had three albums under the belt and were highly praised for their technical abilities. So how would the metal world react to their new female lead singer? \n\n\nWhen Wages of Sin was released in 2001, the vocals of one Angela Gossow were highly suspect, as was the possible future of the band\u2026 until you actually listened to the album. What \u201cWages\u201d was can only be described as heavy metal mastery. The riffs explode off the album, the solos are a pleasure to listen to and the rhythm section is perfect. The Amott brothers are truly a pair of the best guitarists out there and Angela has one of the most unique and powerful voices in all of thrash/death metal. Every song merits multiple listens, while having its own unique flavor that sets it apart from the rest of the album. Wages of Sin is as close as you can get to thrash metal perfection in this reviewer\u2019s opinion and set a new benchmark for the band. \n\n\nWell in 2003, it was time for AE to record their sophomore effort with Ms. Gossow and prove to the world that Wages wasn\u2019t just a fluke. Well, I can say that the results weren\u2019t all that bad. Where Wages seemed like more of a cry for help, with very introspective lyrics and driven by highly technical guitar work, Anthems of Rebellion comes off as more of a straightforward power album and lyrically a slap in the face to authority. It stands as a strong metal album with a number of great songs and is a good war cry for metal fans against war, politics or just anyone above them in general. \n\n\nIs that to say that this isn\u2019t a technical album? No, it still has its number of melodic riffs and excellent solos, but overall it feels a bit dumbed down since Wages of Sin. It still stands alone as a great metal album, but it doesn\u2019t quite push AE to the limits of what they\u2019re capable of. Essentially, it\u2019s a bit more accessible to a larger audience than their former efforts, but AE\u2019s hardcore fans still can appreciate it. \n\n\nThe reason I can say this is because Anthems is essentially the album that got me into AE, and is a good starting point for anyone interested in the band. It\u2019s a very aggressive, well-played, well-produced album with enough of an edge to appeal to a wide variety of metalheads. Death Metal fans will appreciate the heaviness and power of the album, while more progressive metal fans can enjoy the melodic riffs that the Amott brothers can bring forth. Overall, this album has a little something for everyone, but not quite everything for anyone. \n\n\nThe main problem with this album is that it can be very inconsistent. You can listen to one song and appreciate it for its originality, melody, solos and everything else, and you hope the next song will have the same quality. More often than not, the next song will fail to impress. While a good number of songs are excellent, towards the end of the album it feels as if it\u2019s beginning to fall apart. Therefore, unlike its nearly flawless predecessor, Anthems of Rebellion has a few too many pitfalls to make it an overall excellent album. \n\n\nAnthems starts off on an excellent tone. The opening march of \u201cTear Down the Walls\u201d is enough to get any metal fan excited about what\u2019s to come, and is immediately followed by \u201cSilent Wars\u201d. A riff-happy, aggressive song that immediately lets you know that this is an Arch Enemy album. The lyrics are very fitting for the message that the album is trying to get across, that we\u2019ve had enough of our normal lives and are left with nothing but anger. It serves as a good springboard for what should be quite a ride through the rest of the album. \n\n\n\u201cWe Will Rise\u201d is one of the true highlights of the album and a fine example as to why Arch Enemy is one of the finest metal bands today. A catchy yet admirable main riff, meaningful, deep lyrics and overall excellent songwriting pull this awesome track together. This song should be the lead anthem for a new legion of metal fans. What Sex Pistols\u2019 \u201cAnarchy in the UK\u201d was for angsty British kids in the late 70\u2019s is what \u201cWe Will Rise\u201d should be for metal fans in 2000\u2019s. What AE has here is a powerful song with a message that should energize metal fans to not be afraid to embrace the genre they love and say \u201cfuck you\u201d to the rest of the music industry. To stand up and proudly preach their appreciation and fandom of metal, in hopes that they will be heard and put and end to all the apathy, normalcy and mediocrity in the popular music scene. Cap the song\u2019s great main riff and poignant lyrics with some great solo work from the Amotts\u2019 and we have one of the best metal songs of the 2000\u2019s. \n\n\nNot to be outdone, \u201cDead Eyes See No Future\u201d continues to emphasize AE\u2019s struggle for perfection in their craft. Aggressive progression combined with a beautiful-sounding music with a refrain screamed as only Angela Gossow can. As the military drums arise along with the beautiful light guitars burst back into the refrain towards the end of the song, it becomes quite apparent that this is another big feather in AE\u2019s cap. This is probably my personal favorite song on the album, one of my favorite AE songs overall and I think gives a nice example of how power and melody can be interwoven to create one awesome product. However, \u201cInstinct\u201d, the next song, is where the album\u2019s inconsistencies begin. Up to this point, the album has been spot-on, but here\u2019s where it begins to slow down a bit. A nice interweaving of a techno line and a guitar riff begins the song good enough, but problems arise as it goes on. The instrumental work on this song just doesn\u2019t quite feel up to the previous tracks, and neither do the lyrics. It\u2019s not to say that this song isn\u2019t good, it\u2019s quite catchy and after a couple listens you\u2019ll find yourself screaming along with a few lines, but overall it just doesn\u2019t quite live up to what you\u2019ve heard so far. \n\n\n\u201cLeader of the Rats\u201d is where the album picks up steam again. Once again, the song starts off with more great riffing work, which are soon complimented perfectly by the sharp, biting lyrics. The song is a tough, striking and occasionally soaring feat, reaching great heights with few negatives. It serves to put the album back on track. Yet, where this gives hope, the next track takes away. \u201cExist to Exit\u201d is just a slow and overall uninteresting track. It really doesn\u2019t stand well with a few of the previous tracks. It\u2019s not that Arch Enemy can\u2019t do great songs. \u201cSavage Messiah\u201d from Wages serves as a great example of what AE can accomplish in their slower songs, but this song \"Exist to Exit\" just can\u2019t stack up with other tracks on this Anthems album or that they\u2019ve done before. It almost serves as the beginning of the end of what should\u2019ve been an overall excellent metal album. \n\n\nAside from \u201cEnd of the Line\u201d, a nice heavy piece which displays some interesting backing vocals and a nice mix riffs, the rest of the album is pretty lackluster. The rest of the songs on the album really aren\u2019t that bad, just disappointing. Arch Enemy is a band that is talented enough to make every song a great song, but these last few tracks on the album just don\u2019t live up to the high expectations that listeners should have for this band. The short instrumental tracks of \u201cAnthem\u201d and \u201cMarching On a Dead End Road\u201d I think do more justice to this band\u2019s talents than songs like the uninteresting \u201cDehumanization\u201d. \n\n\nOverall, when this album shines, it gleams among some of the best recordings in metal. Yet, it's where it lacks its luster that the major problems stick out. Not to say that this is a bad album, or even has any songs that are particularly terrible. It\u2019s just that Arch Enemy is a band that is capable of keeping listeners hooked onto an album from beginning to end, and this just isn\u2019t one of those albums. For the first few songs, this album ROCKS! I love listening to the first couple songs. And while the latter songs are still very good when compared to other thrash and death metal that\u2019s out there, it just leaves listeners feeling that there could\u2019ve been more. I\u2019m sure there are people who love the latter songs on the album, but I just don\u2019t think they do justice to the true talents of this band. It\u2019s an album which consists of an uneven balance excellent moments and missed opportunities. \n\n\nI would still recommend this album as a good starting point. For those who may not be so technically savvy, the later songs may serve as a nice relief from what seems to be AE\u2019s longing to fit as many notes into a song as possible. This album can appeal to a wide variety of metal fans because it does consist of a wide variety of styles in its songs. I still recommend this album because the songs on this album that ARE great are great enough to merit its purchase, and it\u2019s because of those songs that I still have a great amount of respect and love for this album. Arch Enemy is capable of great things, and this album certainly showcases some of their greater skills. It\u2019s a good display of what they can do, what they should stay away from and a hope for what they will do on their next album. If Wages of Sin is a 10, then Anthems of Rebellion is somewhere a little below an 8, and in this reviewer\u2019s book, that ain\u2019t too bad.\n",
        "\nFirst off I'd like to point out that the opening riff for Burning Angel is lifted directly from Megadeth's Hangar 18. That said, it's not a bad song. Unlike a good chunk of the people at the EM, I like Arch Enemy, old stuff and new stuff.\n\nLike so many Gothenburg bands, the production on this single rips. The drums are thunderous without too much \"boom\", the bass is smooth and low, and the guitars are clear, but heavily distorted.\n\nNice guitar melodies on the title track. Lots of theme and variation, the composing shows \"maturity\" for a lack of a better word. Nice vibe, especially on the chorus. A breakdown that doesn't suck, everything stops, then the brothers Amott hit you with a some killer solos. A key change, then it ends.\n\nLament of a Mortal soul kicks ass. The drum line is cool as fuck. Cool chromatic riff, then a passage that might remind some of mallcore bands, but the guitars, bass, and drums are so fucking tight I don't care. Drumming kicks ass throughout. Great solos, outro.\n\nI love Arch Enemy's version of Judas Priest's Starbreaker. It has Johan on vocals, so if you looove Halford's performance on this song, you may not like this one so much. Personally, I think it's cool. Guitars are awesome, they sound more aggressive than the original.\n\nThis is a Japanese release. The double disk version of Wages of Sin should still be available in the States, and it has all the songs on this single, so don't bother. Good stuff, though.\n",
        "\nAs one of the elite and most recognized acts at the forefront of the Swedish battlelines, Arch Enemy have played an immense role in refining and defining the shape of melodic death metal as we know it today. With an ever evolving sound, the band took another bold step in 2001 by introducing the new female voice of Arch Enemy. Despite much controversy, Angela Gossow's first outing with the band, Wages Of Sin, went on to receive worldwide praise. The ex-Devil In The Details vokillist crushed any and all doubts that a 'girl' could front the legendary Arch Enemy with a brutal performance that went beyond that of Johan Liiva's harsh verses on previous albums. And so a new chapter began... \n\nNow, Arch Enemy is highly respected throughout the world, but none, however, admire them quite as much as the Japanese. To pay tribute to their fan base in Japan, the band dedicated an entire live recording to them whilst on the Burning Bridges tour in 1999 that would be the pricey, hard to find Burning Japan Live. More recently, while on the road promoting their 2003 album Anthems Of Rebellion, the Enemy felt it was necessary to honor Japan once again, this time in the form of an EP. Assembled with the next single, \"Dead Eyes See No Future\" in mind, the mini-disc was compiled from latter day Gossow rarities, including two live cuts from an earlier Paris show, and three of the band's own renditions of well known metal classics. Fans outside of Japan sat in teary eyed dismay as the Japanese pointed and giggled. Neener! Neener! Neener! \n\nThe day that both American and European fans alike have long been hoping for is among us. The Japan only issued Dead Eyes See No Future EP has finally seen worldwide release. No longer will the ravenous such as myself be duped into purchasing shamelessly overpriced copies from auction sites like Ebay. Century Media has opted to seize the opportunity of demand and allow everyone access to the disc. Now everyone stare at the angry Japanese kids as we drive away. No disrespect intended here, but, Neener! to you! Isn't it just about a hoot and a holler being nine years old all over again? \n\nSo, shall we discuss the content of the EP in more detail? Yes, lets! As previously stated, Dead Eyes See No Future features live clips of \"Burning Angel\" and 'We Will Rise\", recorded in Paris, France. Every aspect of these tracks are flawless and not far off from their studio counterparts, with the exception of audience participation, of course. On Arch Enemy's remake of the classic Manowar opus \"Kill With Power\", they take power metal cheese and convert it into their own killer style, slaying the original in every meaning of the word. Examining Michael Amott's memory banks in depth reveals his roots in Carcass. \"Incarnate Solvent Abuse\" is a blistering heap of putrefied pulverization that runs the risk of lobotomizing the listener. By the end of this ripping number you will surely be indecisive of which version you prefer more. Both slice through your aural senses with surgical precision. Onward, we uncover my only disappointment in Dead Eyes See No Future, and it is very minuscule. With Megadeth's \"Symphony Of Destruction\", the band's musical performance is right on track, however, when it comes to the vocals, Angela seems to lack feeling in the rhythm enunciations, as if she was singing to a song she had never heard before that day in the studio. Despite that minor issue, the track really rocks! \n\nFor the fan's sake, I would hope that Century Media pressed plenty of copies of Dead Eyes See No Future to go around for all Arch Enemy enthusiasts to get their greedy little hands on. This is a priceless addition to any metal collection. Whether you're in America, Europe, or Japan, get yours today. LITERALLY!\n",
        "\nThis EP starts off with an album track from their latest full-length. Unfortunately, since Angela joined the band, any song that Arch Enemy have written has been rediculoulsy boring, and this is no exception. It doesn't have the feeling of a song, more like a collection of instruments played, while Angela does her worst growl possible over the song, and they try to make as much money as possible. This is all good and well, but Arch Enemy are part of a stagnating genre, and aren't doing anything to help the situation.\n\nNow, the live songs. Arch Enemy sound very much similar live as they do on CD. The riffs are generally well constructed, and as they should be, seeing as who's in the band. But Angela's voice is just even worse than on CD. It really does sound like she's using some sort of distortion on her voice to make it sound as 'death metal' as possible, instead of creating the vocals herself. Of course, these are Arch Enemy songs, and they're still as boring as they are on CD, it's just now we have a live crowd chanting along sometimes. Great....\n\nAnd we come to the covers. First we have Megadeth's Symphony Of Destruction. A well-respected song, which Arch Enemy managed to completely butcher. Angela's voice is worse than ever before, and it now does sound so much like she has to use voice effects. The instrumentation is well crafted, and re-performed by the band, despite seeming to be pointlessly heavy, and the bass has an annoying tone. They could've not released this song, and still been an average band in my mind, but with this, they ruined all reputation they had. Awful.\n\nNow, why would Arch Enemy even think of covering a Manowar song? Well, I have no idea, but at least they don't make such a bad job of it. Angela's voice doesn't seem to have the crappy distortion it had before, but it's still an awful voice. Again, the instrumentation is performed well, and this time it doesn't seem to be pointlessly heavy. This is probably the best song on here, as performed by Arch Enemy.\n\nAnd, the last cover is Carcass. Why, God? Why? Which member of the band thought that it would be a good idea to cover this song? Most likely Angela, as she's admittedly a huge Carcass fan. She would've been an even bigger Carcass fan if she'd never have butchered this song, as this is awful. Utterly awful. There is no other words for this. The instruments sound awful, Angela's voice sounds awful. They make the song sound awful. I have no idea how they managed to make a legendary Carcass song sound bad, but they did.\n\nSeriously, this is something to avoid, as goes from bad to absolutely fucking awful. Please, whatever you do, don't buy it. It's not worth it.\n",
        "\nThis mediocre album begins with a chanting crowd that is used as the introduction to the track that doesn\u2019t know where it\u2019s going. The track, \u201cSilent Wars,\u201d is a track that doesn\u2019t really have much personality but is filled with some decorative guitar work here and there but lacks personality and therefore is pretty bland. It\u2019s not too much of a letdown, as the next track redeems my hope that this album is worth something more than my frustration.\n\n\u201cWe Will Rise,\u201d is a great song that is very memorable and well composed. It has the personality that the previous song lacks, mainly due to the guitar solos and the memorable chorus. This type of energy is evident throughout most of the album, as it is the main formula that makes this album not a complete waste of time.\n\nThe next track, \u201cDead Eyes See No Future,\u201d illustrates the album\u2019s ability to cross into the lighter side of Death Metal, with clean guitar solos and calmer drum parts. Double bass does get boring fast, when not done correctly, but this band does not overdo itself and keeps things simple for the sake of not sounding too repetitive.\n\nSpeaking of repetitive, Angela Gossows\u2019s voice. Monotonous vocals that getting boring pretty fast are a negative trait that this album is almost filled with. At about the fourth or fifth track this becomes apparent and hinders the album from being what it could have been. Now the vocals aren\u2019t too terrible, but they just don\u2019t have much persona, which could have made this album better. They do somewhat change on some of the tracks, but overall they remain dull and tedious. It is a drawback, but I know that the vocals could have been much worse.\n\nOne of the highlights of the album is perhaps the sixth track, \u201cLeader of the Rats,\u201d it\u2019s filled with energy, melody and the vocals are slightly better and at least change pitch in some cases, as opposed to most of the remaining tracks. It also goes for the seventh track, \u201cExist to Exit.\u201d This is more of a melodic track, which allows Angela to change the pitch of her voice and add some variety to the song but is a bit bland and not too memorable.\n\nThe eight track is a piece of shit as it is almost completely useless. This is a track of overdone acoustic guitars right in the midst of a Death Metal album. I understand that is an intermission and introduction to the next song, which is the most aggressive song on the album, but it just doesn\u2019t fit well into the overall feel of the album. Speaking of the next track, \u201cDespicable Heroes,\u201d is one of the best songs on the album. Angela\u2019s voice isn\u2019t monotonous, the drum work is excellent, and the guitar riffs are splendid. It is a very well done track that could have been better if it was a little longer, but nevertheless is a track that stands out and strengthens the album.\n\nThe tenth track is something new and very welcome. Almost adding a bit of a gothic edge into the song, another female singer (or maybe it\u2019s also Angela, I\u2019m really not sure) offers gothic inspired vocals in the background that work well with the aggressive vocals of Angela. This song, in a way, reminded me of the band Darkseed, mostly due to the gothic vocals in the background. This is a very welcome improvement to the other songs, as it definitely adds well-needed variety to a majority of the songs.\n\nThe 11th track is as much a waste as track eight. It serves no possible use on the album. This track is basically a synthesized (or at least I think) song of about a minute entitled \u201cAnthem.\u201d There is no possible reason to put this on an album, except if you want to make your album a 13-song album, which is the stupidest idea in the world. Why do bands do stupid shit like this? Why does Manowar almost always add some pussy song on their albums *coughNassunDormacough*, and why did this track ever make it into the final cut. Do the bands want to show some variety in their styles? Well than stop singing in one monotonous voice. Adding some retarded tracks that have no significance is almost always totally pointless.\n\nThat aside, the last track is a strong finish to this mediocre album. \u201cSaints and Sinners\u201d is a more memorable and powerful song that most of the other songs on the album. It adds a big bang to the finish and is one of the stronger tracks on the album.\n\nOverall, this album is nothing special and definitely not the place to get introduced to the band. Try something better like Stigmata for example, before you decide that you\u2019re a fan of this band. Buy this only if you truly appreciate mediocre albums.\n",
        "\nIt is usually hard to find tour edition CDs unless you are able to track the band down to an area near you. Some people will shell out loads of cash just to obtain these rare gems. But sometimes, you simply have to ask yourself if they are really even worth it.\n\nLike a usual EP, Dead Eyes See No Future features the track that it is named after, straight from the album it's on (namely Anthems Of Rebellion in this case), and the token live tracks and cover tracks. In this case, there are two live tracks, and it is funny to know that while \"Arch Enemy\" has pretty much kept themselves clean, the new vocalist let's the obscenities flow on stage.\n\nFirst on the chopping block of the cover songs is 'Symphony Of Destruction' (a \"Megedeth\" cover), which isn't all that impressive. It's decent to say anything. Then along comes the smoking cover of the \"Manowar\" track 'Kill With Power'. That one, and the \"Carcass\" cover 'Incarnated Solvent Abuse' essentially make up this EP.\n\nSure the song the EP is based on is good, and the live tracks add to the value, but the only really good thing about the album are the last two cover tracks. Aside from that being the main reason to track this CD down, it's just another average EP for everyone.\n",
        "\nRemember Arch Enemy? They were this fucking great melodic deathmetal band infused with NWOBHM. They were brutal and intricate with Legend/Judas Priest interludes that made their music UNIQUE. Shredding, classic heavy metal guitars melded into crushing melodic deathmetal, like a Heartwork at the core taken to a progressive level with tons of time changes, guitar solos and rockin' breaks. They had amazing drumming of a Neil Peart quality infused with typical double bass deathmetal skins to create an overall amalgamation of heavy metal and melodic death metal that made you fuckin' headbang like a warrior. To call them Gothenberg really was incorrect because, though they had some of that sound, they had so much more; so much \"real metal\" in them.\n\nThat band is no more.\n\nArch Enemy were without question one of my top five with their first three releases. I even remained loyal to them when they ditched Liiva, who I consider a favorite vocalist. Then I heard the result -- Wages of Sin. Not good. There were hints of the heavy metal infusion and hints of the brutality, but at its core, it no longer was a unique sound, it was generic melodic deathmetal. OK, I said, that wasn't their best effort, but I'll stick by them, they're still one of my favorite bands, I won't abandon them. Well, now Anthems of Rebellion is out. It was like a stab in the back. Its absolute shittiness left me feeling betrayed. I'm glad there's a different vocalist here, because I probably wouldn't be able to listen to their first three, brilliant albums simply due to the crap produced with Anthems. Anthems of Rebellion? More like Anthems of Becoming a Generic Metal Band with No Unique Qualities and No Memorable Songs. \n\nEnough about the social effect the album had on me. Enough about how brilliant they were with their unique, infused metal. Enough about how labeling them as Gothenberg was a slap in the face to their uniqueness, creativity and absolute mastery. To label them as Gothenberg now would be a compliment. This music is boring, typical melodic shit. \n\nA big complaint people had about the REAL Arch Enemy was that Liiva sounded monotonous and lifeless. Well, how about Angela? She sounds lifeless AND like every other metal vocalist out there. \n\nHow about the music? No semblance of death metal (unlike before), no semblance of heavy metal (unlike before), so heart (unlike before), no spirit (you get the picture). What you get here is simplistic, formulaic melodic deathmetal with no interesting leads, lifeless guitars and mediocre drums with few fills or interest. There are even some nu-metal influences in there (listen to Leader of the Rats). There are some chugging, death-metally moments, but they're cliche and dull. What you get here is a band losing everything that made it a BAND... a group of musicians putting out music that set themselves apart from all genres. Now you get a group of musicians putting out music to try to appeal to a more mainstream crowd, blending themselves in with the melodic metal genre. It is straight-forward \"New Wave of Swedish Death Metal\" with its boring riffs and lame choruses. There are no interesting time changes, no interesting breaks, no interesting interludes, no interesting ANYTHING. In Flames, Soilwork, The Crown... Arch Enemy. It pains me to group them together, but it has to be done... \n\n... That's what they've become.\n",
        "\nMike Amott seems to think that the whole aura of what made 'Wages Of Sin' so popular, ie the dual guitars/ guitar duels, were turning the band into the \"Dream Theater of death metal\", hence why he decided to virtually strip all (noteworthy) solo's from the music.\nThe result?\nWe're left with a bland uninspired piece of radio friendly rubbish. If it wasn't for the logo on the front of the CD, you'd have a hard time convincing me that this was an Arch Enemy release at all.\n\nGone is the combination of heaviness with ever so Swedish melody, always present yet never over-used like In Flames and latter Soilwork. Replacing it is a seemingly brown-nosing attempt to get these insipid mediocre songs as much mainstream airplay as possible.\n\nThat's not to say that there isn't some semblence of decent songs on here. Songs like Dead Eyes See No Future start with possibly one of the best starts to a song I've heard from Arch Enemy for a hell of a long time, but as with the rest of this album it soon descends into unintentional cheesiness and loses all its edge.\nSome people would blame Angela Gossow simply because she was the latest person to join the group, but that's far too easy. Plus it's besides the point that Angela Gossow is pretty much the only member of the band who is actually given enough free reign, aside from Mike Amott's garbled shoddy solos (If you can call them so), to shine. The once roaming and respected drumming of Daniel Erlandsson is stifled beyond belief here, so much so that they might as well have just called the album the 'Mike and Angela Show'\n\nIf you're honestly contemplating buying this album you've either never heard anything Arch Enemy did before 'Wages Of Sin', or quite frankly you have severely masochistic tendencies.\nAs to those people that actually rate this album, what can I say? \nIt defies all belief, even to a disappointed former BIG Arch Enemy fan such as myself, that the band could release something quite so dire as this. Particularly as Mike Amott had gone to substantial lengths to try and make out Arch Enemy were still \"heavy\" and \"underground\" , wanting to stay respected as being heavy and not selling out; and yet compromising those very words by releasing this pile of rubbish.\n\navoid.\n",
        "\nLadies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you \"Wages Of Sin\", perfected. Don't get me wrong, I really loved that album, but I've always felt it was generally overrated, for despite its ability to blow most of 2002's other releases out of the proverbial water, there was something missing, namely the relentless feeling I used to get when listening to stuff like \"Black Earth\" and \"Burning Bridges\". Oh yes, the greatness was there, but the overall sensation tediously getting in the way was that of a slightly watered down affair, which obviously damaged the album's consistency to some extent. And no, that wasn't to blame on new vocalist Angela Gossow, her job was really good (not overwhelming, but who listens to Arch Enemy for the vocals anyway)? The finger was to be pointed to the songwriting, where occasional shortcomings would sporadically slacken the tension.\nThat was the past. The present is \"Anthems To Rebellion\", which simply takes the best elements from \"Wages Of Sin\", gets rid of any forgettable aspect and adds the natural progression the band has gone through in the meantime. Yes, it's bound to be good, and such a promise is entirely fulfilled.\nThe band's performance is, if possible, even tighter than before, and Angela's vocals have definitely improved in terms of variety and effectiveness.\n\nWe begin with a weird little intro named \"Tear Down the Walls\", which just consists of a syncopated rhythm with someone going \"Hey!\" over it; although not really necessary, it sets the \"rebellious\" mood for the rest of the record. It doesn't last for long, though, and immediately after that, \"Silent Wars\" hits us like a train with its brutal, fast riffage. This just COMMANDS headbanging, and when Angela unleashes her serpentine screams things only become more intense. Adrain's drumming is overpowering from the very beginning, laying the foundation for the song's untamed power as well as driving the clever variations with its flawless pattern shifts. A perfect album opener, which manages to be catchy an dtechnical at the same time (just listen to that impossibly-tempoed break just before the solo), and for sure a candidate for a long stay in future Arch Enemy live setlists.\n\"We Will Rise\" slows things down and introduces an amazing dose of melodic catchiness, showing ho wmuch the band's musical views have widened since the last time. I need to underline how such a catchy element doesn't eclipse the general heaviness, but rather thrives on it (further proving the point that sometimes slower moments can be much more heavy than grinding supersonic blazers). The opening / chorus riff will be stuck in your head forever, as well as some of the solos.\n\"Dead Eyes See No Future\" begins as yet another typical Arch Enemy thrasher, until the chorus sets in and an unpredicatble melancholic mood, enhanced by delicate keyboard lines, takes over. These two contrasting elements - aggression and sadness - coexist and create an irresistible stream of intensity, which reaches an emotional peak during a break when the chorus melody is just played by a lone clean guitar, gentle keyboards and distant march-like snare drum rolls, just before the all-guns-blazing chorus storms in yet again.\n\nThis brings us to another crucial point defining the strength of the new album: a lot of new, different elements have found their way into the Arch Enemy sound, breathing new life inside the picture without overshadowing the long time trademarks. \"Exist to Exit\" is another song that exemplifies this rather well, with its really ominous atmosphere accompaining the band's usual millimetric performance (great rhythm changes going on between the verses and the chorus).\n\"Saints and Sinners\", the album closer, switches from a plodding verse (backed by great double pedal artillery) to a more open sounding chorus, where more keyboards add a slight symphonic feeling without sacrificing aggression.\nAnd of course there's \"End of the Line\", a more melodic but equally hammering attack where bizarrely filtered clean vocals (courtesy of the Amott brothers) pop up in the chorus! These guys definitely don't want to repeat themselves, and they achieve their goal by surprising us in each and every song.\n\nBut there are also several flat out Arch Enemy assaults to be found here too. \"Despicable Heroes\" is the first to come to mind, with its unbelievably fast picking and rumming and furious riffs, definitely one of the band's most aggressive moments since \"Stigmata\", easily beating \"Dead Bury Their Dead\" from the previous album.\n\"Leader of the Rats\" is slower and more groovy, and a perfect pit-mover. The chorus riff is killer and once again extremely catchy, and makes a really good contrast with the slow and menacing middle section. Great vocals from Angela, too, although the weird effect used on the first verse is kind of annoying.\nSpeaking of classic Arch Enemy trademarks, there are a couple of intrumentals to be found here, too. \"Marching on a Dead End Road\" is a dirge-like acoustic interlude based upon the chorus riff from \"Dead Eyes See No Future\" with a good melodic developement and of course very clean guitar work. \"Anthem\" is the exact opposite with its triumphant, uplifting feel; the solo sounds kind of curious as it begins as a minor scale when the song is all based on major chords... the effect isn't bad, though.\n\nThis album has only one minor drawback for me... well, actualy it has two, namely \"Instict\" and \"Dehumanization\". The first one is a slow paced number showing more fantastic percussive fireworks from Adrain but doesn't really go anywhere riff-wise; the lyrics are also pretty insipid, as well as seriously unoriginal: anyone who heard and read the lyrics from \"Wages Of Sin\" will immediately recall \"Behind the Smile\" (which wasn't that great song to begin with).\n\"Dehumanization\" is euqally lacking in the melody department, and thsi time the clean vocals get in the way really too often, and soon become predictable and annoying. the synth line that appears in the chorus and is left alone to end the song is nice, though.\n\nAs a closing note, I have to praise Andy Sneap's excellent sound wizardry (it even surpasses his own job on \"Wages Of Sin\", and that is really saying something) as well as the very good artwork, fitting the album's theme perfectly with its \"Blade Runner\" reminescences. Very highly recommended, in case you still have some doubts. It's really worth it\n",
        "\nI'll start by saying I am a little bit biased in that \"Wages Of Sin\" was my CD of 2002, because it was all killer no filler in my book--the production was perfect, the playing was spot-on, and the gorgeous Fraulein Angela Gossow kicked unholy amounts of ass with her terrifying vocals that left Johan Liiva's pasty Swedish arse in the dust! No, I was not a fan of Johan's weak, limited vocals, I will freely admit; they were great players being held back by a crappy vocalist. But now, dare I say it, they have topped themselves with this opus.\n\nThe production is even better then last time, amazingly enough; the drums sound like an artillery assault, the bass roars like a rabid lion, and of course, the guitars sing, shriek, crunch, and KILL! And Angela, of course, is soaring over the top of it all with her deadly vocal assault, still proving that women can hang with extreme metal vocal technique just fine. An album to make your speakers groan in pain, in short. Thank you, Andy Sneap--you da MAN!!!\n\nSong-wise, well, some are better than others, but this album kills from start to finish. From the killer beginner of \"Silent Wars\" (that pre-chorus, with its full speed/half speed alternation gets my head bangin' every time) seguing into the brilliantly melodic \"We Will Rise\", to the middle tunes like \"Dead Eyes See No Future\" (one of my faves, featuring Michael's heartrending, emotional ending solo) \"Leader of the Rats\" and \"Instinct\" with its sludgy, A-tuned riffing, to the ending tunes like \"End of the Line\", the Bros. Amott consistently pull an impressive array of riffs, licks, rhythms and melodies that are catchy and memorable, as well as just plain staggering. \n\nMichael's more plaintive, bluesy lead style still perfectly contrasts his brother's wilder, more technical shredding, and each one gets to to strut their stuff with individual instrumentals that are really quite pretty. Christopher's \"Marching Down A Dead End Road\" is a sweet little multitracked acoustic piece reminiscent of old Yngwie Malmsteen (only more tasteful) that also quotes the chorus melody of \"Dead Eyes See No Future\" as well as nicking a line from that tune, and Michael's \"Freedom\" is a soaring, blues-drenched turn in the spotlight worthy of the mighty Gary Moore. \n\nI don't care what folks say about Arch Enemy, these last two CDs, for me at least, have shown them at some of their best playing and songwriting, as well as guitar playing. And Angela ought to punch out some of these idiots who keep downing her, as she is a more than worthy replacement for Johan who gave the band a much-needed shot of life and energy! She's buffed enough, I think she could do it...*G* Anyway, melodic death or not, this is just plain great metal, and these folks deserve their accolades after years of hard work. One of my fave CDs of 2003, needless to say, this was.\n",
        "\nBlack Earth, the debut from Arch Enemy is a lesson in aggression and subtle melodies. Fresh from his stint in Carcass, Michael Amott joined with his brother Christopher to make a CD that took the sound of older Swedish Death, and mixed it with a touch of Heartwork era Carcass and added in more melody. The result is one of the best debuts from any Metal band in the mid 90\u2019s.\n\nWhile Arch Enemy can correctly be termed as Melodic Death Metal, they have very little in common with bands like Dark Tranquillity and In Flames musically. Arch Enemy on Black Earth, are almost Thrashy in nature, being very riff heavy, with a lot of fast drumming and memorable leads. A lot of the riffs have that Carcass Death/Groove feel that was present on Heartwork as well and it mixes very well into the songs. Johan Liiva, who sang on the Carnage demos (Michael Amott\u2019s first group, and one of the first Swedish Death bands), handles the vocals on Black Earth. While he sounds really good on \u201cFields Of Desolation\u201d and \u201cBury Me An Angel\u201d, overall his vocal performance is somewhat lacking. I\u2019ve never been a huge fan of Liiva, as his style used is a somewhat grunt/growl that sounds like it\u2019s almost spoken, rather than sung. Sometimes he sounds good, other times he doesn\u2019t, but his gruff style does fit the music and you have to give him some credit, due to the fact that no one really sounds like him. Music wise most of this CD is very fast, especially the brutal opener, \u201cBury Me An Angel\u201d. Other songs have some mid-paced, almost groove heavy sections, but generally speaking this is very fast Metal with plenty of double bass and aggressive drum runs, which are handled superbly by Daniel Erlandsson. The leads are also excellent with both brothers having distinct styles, and they really add a lot to the songs. In fact, \u201cCosmic Retribution\u201d has one of my favorite sequences of leads. First is a blistering solo from Michael Amott, which eventually goes into an acoustic solo from Christopher Amott that fits surprisingly well. About \u00be of the way through this solo, some double bass comes in which eventually paves the way for the distorted guitars to come roaring back with Christopher Amott delivering a melodic solo of his own. Sure, there are better played solos out there, but just something about this sequence really makes it cool (for lack of a better word).\n\nThe only faults of this CD can be pinpointed to an overall vocal performance that isn\u2019t quite at the same level as the music and a short length. There are only 7 full-length tracks on here, with the weakest being \u201cTransmigration Macabre\u201d, although this track is still has a lot of good moments. There are two 1-minute instrumentals, both of which are actually quite useful and good, however, 7 full length tracks is still a bit on the short side. Regardless though, this is an exceptional release that contains first-rate riffs, leads, drum work, and song writing. One of the most brutal and heavy Melodic Death Metal releases to be sure.\n\nSong highlights: Pretty much everything, although my favorites are Bury Me An Angel, Dark Insanity, Cosmic Retribution, and Fields Of Desolation\n",
        "\nOkay it's not good either. But at least the Iron Maiden riff recycling isn't as hideously overt, and there are even some thrash riffs in here. And, best of all, the riffs aren't completely forgotten under the verses. They are, however, completely forgettable. That is the main drawback of the album, that while there are some neat intro riffs, and whatnot, the entire structure of the song is not dominated by them. Under the verses, the guitar work just tends to get kinda sloppy... for example, note \"The Immortal.\" Before the first verse, a cool intro riff. After that verse, a very nice riff as well. Under the verse? Some noise, really.\n\n\"Pilgrim\" - special mention. The chorus riff is totally David Bowie's \"Panic in Detroit\". Yes, there are such overt melodic moments and at times the album sounds almost Helloween-ish (see intro riff to \"Silverwing\" which is one section of some Walls of Jericho solo, repeated over and over again). \n\nSo overall what we have here is a real mishmash, which is typical of Gothenburg. The riff construction ranges from the horrible to the decent, and is more of the latter. However, there is really only one or two really really great riffs in every song, and they tend to get buried. For instance, the best riff in Silverwing is at around 1.13 and occurs for all of one second.\n\n\"Angelclaw\" is probably the highlight, because it rides that nice thrashy intro riff for a while, and then in the middle has some great lead work. Oh yes, there is no questioning the lead work here - that's absolutely fantastic. It's the riffs that need some help. Too little attention is paid to the transitions between good riffs, and bad ones are put in way too often.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, this is about the regular single-cd version.\n\nFor some reason I've kept my distance to Arch Enemy before they released this one, I dunno if the reason had something to do with the fact that the singer sucked ass or that the music was such an obvious copy of In Flames' style. However, that's not important right now. The thing is they've gotten themselves a new vocalist so I thought I'd check the new material out. So what is the verdict? Well musically they've grown alot actually, sure they sound abit like In Flames (and other such bands, like Dark Tranquillity) in the bottom - but this album is really nice anyway cause they use lots of stuff other bands in this genre never done before.. for example slower intros and riffs ala Black Sabbath, how about that one?\n\nSecond, the new vocalist really has some growling talent! I was kind of shocked by the fact that it is a she! A female growler by the name of Angela. And she growls just as good as any male in this genre! So almost only good stuff on here. With that said I know I have to pinpoint some flaws (although no important ones), so here's the deal. I don't like those slower intros actually, it doesn't really fit this genre very good (I want double kicks goddamnit!!) and another thing is the lyrics which isn't always very lifting. For example \"Savage messiah\" (which is a good song) - \"Savage messiah, take us higher\" etc. I dunno about you but that's power metal lyrics to me. Yucky.\n\nBut like I said there's only very small flaws here, the rest is as elite you want it to be - superb fast/melodic riffs, great leads, tight drumming with lots of double kicks.. you name it. Overall a great album which I think every metal fan should go out and buy. I am for sure gonna support this band in the future (if their next albums are gonna be this good that is).\n",
        "\nThe most obvious aspect of Wages Of Sin (and one that is mentioned far too often) is Angela Gossow on vocals. Yes, she is a woman, and yes she has a great death metal voice. Now that that little tidbit is out of the way lets get down to the music and the release as a whole.\n\nWages Of Sin simply smokes from beginning to end. The songs are varied, with fast tempos, slow tempos, mid-paced tempos, atmospheric and dark sounding riffs all woven into each song. No song is a straight speed attack, and no song is a straight mid-tempo crunch. Because of that every song has its own identity, and it's a damn good identity because the overall feeling is one of a crushing but melodic force that engulfs the listener at every turn. I personally think this is very close to a perfect mix of Death/Thrash Metal riffs and subtle melodies- and that is without any keyboard use or clean vocals. This just goes to show what great song writers the band are and that they have improved from their previous releases, which while still being good, are inferior to Wages Of Sin in my opinion.\n\nOther highlights of the CD include extremely tight rhythms that most Swedish based bands are known for. It's no surprise because we all know Eraldson and D'Angelo are some of the best in their field, and the tightness and precision from the two is outstanding. Of course, the great production helps; I just love that double bass power. Another aspect that is worth mentioning is the use of atmospheric parts to accentuate the guitar solos (which are very good mind you). These solos and many riffs, too, usually build up to something really amazing, and that leads for a high level of interest from the listener.\n\nThe only very minor fault of this release is maybe 1 to 3 very, very short lived lull's in certain songs that I could have done without- although is must be said that this is extreme nitpicking. Otherwise I enjoyed this release from beginning to end; although certain killer\nsongs such as \"Enemy Within\" and \"Dead Bury Their Dead\" are noticeably better than \"Web Of Lies\" and \"Heart Of Darkness\", even though the latter two songs are still very enjoyable. I highly recommend this release to Death/Thrash fans that also enjoy melody in their music.\n\nTo comment on the other reviews. I was never a huge fan of Johan Liiva, although I thought he sounded a lot better on Burning Bridges, and while Black Earth is a true classic, I preferred this release.\n"
