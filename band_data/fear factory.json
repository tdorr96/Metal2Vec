        "\nA cover in the middle of an album?! Yeah, that's what California's Fear Factory did on their sophomore album 'Demanufacture' in 1995; putting a cover of Head Of David track 'Dog Day Sunrise' right in the middle!\n\nFirst, the song was clearly different to the album's stuff; much more laid-back between robotic termination. Back in the day I did not know who Head Of David was, but I had bought Godflesh's 'Selfless' a year earlier, and 'Dog Day...' and that album did feel rather similar... Later I learned that Godflesh's Justin Broadrick (vocals, guitar, programming) playd drums in Head Of David. I had noticed the Godflesh influence in FF's sound already earlier, on their debut album from 1992, 'Soul of a New Machine'. So, the song wasn't a bad choice for a single.\n\nThe title track contains hypnotic, droning guitars, heavy slapping bass, driving drumming and airy, Burton C. Bell's unique voice; and a chorus to holler to like no tommorrow! The cover is quite faithful to the original, even though it has even more industrial, mechanical vibe to it. And with considerably tighter drumming! The edited version is considerably shorter, leaving out for example the double kick drum part, and it cuts in and out a bit later in the song, and way before the original ends. The edit is otiose. By the way, there's also a \"radio edit\" of the song, 3:22 long...\n\nThe mix of 'Replica' is a dryer and less powerful version. The guitar have been moved behind and the vocals are effected with distortion. The bass and the drums are now even more audible. It has a colder, and again, mechanical, vibe to it compared to the album version. 'Concreto' is a modernized version of old song 'Concrete', where the band was more death metal/grindcore sounding. The new version still kicks ass, with its meaty, grinding guitar tone, semi-growled vocalization and way better drumming. It's easily the heaviest song here.\n\nI never bought the single back in the day, even though I was collecting extra/unreleased songs from bands. I think this single simply never crossed my way. Anyway, previously unreleased material here isn't too hot, except for 'Concreto', so this one is strictly for collectors. The cover art is cool, by the way!\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nThe industrial metal icons Fear Factory have been no strangers to chaos over the years, not solely as a prime subject of their lyrical pursuits, but sadly also in the band\u2019s interpersonal and business end of things. While not quite having the largest ensemble of past members in their lineup, the longstanding feud with co-founder and drummer Raymond Herrera and longtime bassist turned guitarist Christian Olde Wolbers since their 2009 reformation has been heavily covered in the media, and ultimately culminated in a lawsuit between said ex-members and then present incarnation of the band that put things in limbo for most of the past 4 years. Ultimately this turn of events would lead to highly unique and charismatic front man Burton C. Bell exiting the band in 2020, though not before he was able to record the vocal tracks for the dystopian Sci-Fi masterwork that would be Aggression Continuum, this outfit\u2019s 11th studio LP.\n\nContinuing in the grand stylistic tradition since 1998\u2019s Obsolete, which the band themselves have labeled cyber metal, this is an album that paints a grim post-apocalyptic future not all that different from the one depicted in the Terminator universe with high kinetic yet methodical and accessible songwriting. Drawing heavily from the percussive groove/thrash template that was prominent during the twilight of the Bay Area scene\u2019s initial run in the early 90s and painted over with a dense and consonant keyboard backdrop, it\u2019s a sound that is cold and hard enough to resemble the metal endoskeleton of a cyborg, yet also possessed of a human warmness that covers it with a fleshy exterior. In many respects it is a music that lives and dies by the precision based assault of the guitars and rhythm section, but the Jekyll and Hyde vocal persona that Bell brings to the table is what pulls the whole thing together, embodying the raw viciousness of Jens Kidman of Mushuggah and contrasting it with a clean cut approach to constructing a refrain section.\n\nThe album unfolds in a highly cinematic fashion, with a lone narration likely inspired by John Connor\u2019s speech in the Terminator: Salvation film, setting the stage for what is to come over a dreary keyboard drone. The opening foray of rabid thrashing mayhem \u201cRecode\u201d carries an almost djenting quality to its massively down-tuned guitar and bass-heavy assault, yet the overlay of symphonic keyboards brings in a sense of loftiness that functions as a sort of lingering hope accompanying what is obviously a desolate landscape. Generally the structure that this song follows is a typical verse to chorus exercise in symmetrical composition, but the degree of contrast between the raw aggression of the former section and the anthem-like quality of the latter is so palpable that the structural simplicity melts away into a singular, finely tuned machine with a wide range of expression, and sets the tone for the rest of the album.\n\nWhat follows this highly riveting introduction are a series of similarly structured yet highly distinctive anthems of rebellion and rage. The streamlined pounder \u201cDisruptor\u201d reflects the abject heaviness of the prior song, but is a bit more groove-dominated and bass-centered, making it the obvious choice for a promotional single, while the drawn out and cinematic hyper-thrasher of a title song \u201cAggression Continuum\u201d presents a more frenetic and complex variation on the cyber formulation. It becomes almost an exercise in repetition to note the subtle variations that emerge as this album progresses, but the more melodic contours of \u201cPurity\u201d and the frenzied, riff-happy madness of \u201cManufactured Hope\u201d definitely make their mark upon this opus. The coup de grace of a finale that is \u201cEnd Of Line\u201d is arguably the only offering the matches the theatrical brilliance of \u201cRecode\u201d, as well as matches the thrashing riff work at every juncture and closes the deal with a poignant, keyboard-steeped outro with another inspirational narration.\n\nThe word swansong gets thrown around a bit when a noteworthy band either hangs it up or loses one of its consequential members, but here the label fits far more than it does with most others, barring an unforeseen return of Bell into the fold of course. Between the sheer level of brilliance going on in the instrumentation and the stellar final vocal performance, this album stands as a towering monument of explosive metallic aggression that stands tall among the albums that preceded it, to the point where it arguably outclasses Fear Factory\u2019s own seminal second full length album Demanufacture. It\u2019s impossible to tell at this juncture how songwriting mastermind and guitarist Dino Cazares and the remnant lineup will hope to top this, regardless of who ends up being tapped to replace Bell. And should this prove to be the final chapter in the steel-bound anthology that is Fear Factory\u2019s career, they definitely ended things at the top of their game. \n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nGrowing up on Demanufacture set an expectation for following Fear Factory releases to live up to and with a few good songs stretched out over their vast discography they never lived up to those expectations for another Demanu or something better. However when digging through the past one is surprised to discover Soul of a New Machine for it's distinct sound apart from the rest of F.F.'s arsenal. \n\nThe first thing that grabs me is the hihat sound. Opting to go for something that almost sounds like an extra jangly tambourine. This sound is what drives a huge chunk of this album. Fast beats with both hands alternating on the hihat cymbal are frequent and I can't think of a death metal album that uses this particular approach more than Fear Factory on this release. It's a bit awkward in places but mostly he pulls it off.\n\nWhile speaking about the drums I'd like to also bring up the killer kick sound. You can feel it like a frog in your throat. Especially in extended constant high bpm sections. It's a shame he doesn't ever use a constant high speed double bass section for longer because in short bursts his speed is commendable. Complex patterning is the meat and potatoes here. \n\nThe vocals feel like they could be fine tuned. The clean vocals don't do it for me and I honestly dread whenever they come through. The actual metal vocals aren't as bad as the clean vocals but they still feel just barely amiss. They work in sections where his voice is grating and scrapes through but for half of the album when I hear the voice I just feel like it needs more depth to it.\n\nMilitaries and government themes kind of mesh together a few songs, along with the drums that seem to grasp onto their double handed hi hat beats for dear life. There's plenty to indulge over in the lyrical themes of vivisection, religion, and control.\n\nThe guitars are heavy and have impressive rhythms. It's almost like a heavy version of Djent at times with the spastic yet controlled rhythm. If Djent sounded like this then maybe I would listen to it. \n\n55 minutes long but can feel like an eternity sometimes. I think maybe 1 or 2 of the weaker songs could have been scrapped. At least they end on a good note with Manipulation being one of the strongest on the album. This track is very aggressive and has a robotic feel to it which fits Fear Factory's theme perfectly. \n\nScumgrief, Crash Test, Self Immolation, Flesh Hold and Manipulation are all classics to me being some of fear factory's strongest.\nThe albums biggest flaw is lack of variety with a lot of the tracks sounding quite the same. The first thing I think of when I reminisce about this album are Big God/ Raped Souls but it's mostly for the spoken word intro talking about crime statistics in America and not the song itself.\n\nLifeblind starts off with almost a techno sounding intro. But for the most part this albums biggest flaw is it's lack of variety. 90% of the beats have this start and stop feeling to them before breaking into a skank beat or into a higher tempo ride centric beat. These starts and stops can start to get annoying when compared to the better beats that aren't making you think \"are these drums morse code??\"\n\nI hate to point out what I don't like in this album because of its nostalgic value and being one of the bands that got me into metal but a good review has to be honest. This album could have been better with some vocal tweaking and maybe omitting the clean vocals entirely. Trimming down some unnecessary length would keep it from becoming too long and make the strong tracks that are buried within more memorable. Some more sections for the guitar to cut through the mix would anchor it in my brain too.\n\nIt always amuses me to break this out around someone that didn't know Fear Factory used to sound like this and see the surprise on their face though. With some work this could have been amazing, but as it stands it's just good with some parts that are just meh and a few annoying tropes. It's a great Industrial Metal album but falls a little short of being a great Death Metal one.\n",
        "\nAfter a tumultuous period of the entire 2000's decade with main song-writer and original motor of the band Dino Cazares absent from the lineup, Fear Factory returns in 2010 in full capacity to release 'Mechanize', arguably their first genuine blockbuster album since 'Obsolete' from more than a decade ago. 2001's Digimortal saw the band take a tangent in style exploring song-writing diversity, and doing it very efficiently, all the while definitely straying away from what they had been so far and from the expectations of the fan base. The ensuing Cazares-hiatus era featured a transformation of the sound with more prominent hardcore elements as ex-bassist Christian Wolbers took over guitar riffing duties, taking the band towards a rather more innocuous and bland direction with occasionally decent moments but ultimately a failure to manufacture Fear Factory glory the way the previous Cazares-led albums accomplished time and time again. \n\nThe original sound was now back with a bang, replenished with all its flavor, and most importantly, it felt eminently brand new and avoided being the mere return to form only in style. Song-writing, this was at least as good as they'd ever been. The self-titled opener is as furious and clinical as metal redemption gets. It's like the return of the hero character in films - marvelously exuberant and powerfully inspiring. It still has the one-note riffing, it still has Burton C.Bell yelling about robots taking over the world and his seething hatred for \"the system\", it still has straightforward hard-hitting drums that are basically just a snare and kicks... but it's so damn effectively conducted. \n\nJust the opening buildup section ushering in the imminent sonic violence that would follow, that fat 8-string distortion roar exhibited for the first time, the muted verse patiently containing the track's outrageous explosive energy, accelerating with instinctive momentum, the pre-chorus now preparing its move onto the listener's jugular with a cynical diminished-scale riff, until finally the chorus comes on, and it's as earth-shaking as the track implicitly promised it would be: \"We become mechaniiiiiiiiiized ! Mechaniiiiiiiiized !\". Sorry, I might've... yeah, I got carried away there.\n\nMore generally, Fear Factory had never sounded so huge. Dino's 8-string guitars sound completely crisp despite its lower-than-ground frequencies, the double kicks are machine guns and the snares full and meaty, the bass is grindy (that 'Powershift' intro) and industrially-tinted but tight, and the whole forms a titanic rhythm section, dynamic and constantly in forward motion. Needless to mention the riffing comprises the trademark one-note/two-note syncopated start-stop action, and Dino's right hand shows what the band were missing not so much stylistically as Wolbers made his best Cazares impression on the last couple of albums but with sheer brawn and intensity. The guitar work also features the punctuating power chords; thick as a brick wall and stuffed with gorgeous hi-res distortion; as well as select single-note riffs to give the songs melodic definition. The alt metal stuff is also here as always with power chords of the melodic variety on choruses as well as some open string action with that sharp higher guitar-string snap to finish off some of those choruses.\n\nThe album is mostly homogeneous with its style and sound but there are traces left of extreme metal, as there's a rare blast beat sighting on 'Christploitation' for example. That same track also showcases Fear Factory in orchestral mode with a grand piano opening the ball and sharing the mixing space with the distortion guitars, providing the sort of compositional breadth usually necessary to great albums. The band is far from being a one-trick pony here. \n\n'Designing the Enemy' is surely what many fans were waiting for from the industrial metal giant: the colossal heaviness of the full rhythm section, backed by futuristic sounding synths and arrangements, as a platform to steer the intensity towards vivid emotion on a grandiose and genuinely moving chorus. So far over the years, the band had often failed to produce moments of truly heartfelt bliss with their melodic sections and those parts were instead more epic or at times triumphant sounding - choruses on 'Replica', 'Resurrection', 'Smasher-Devourer' and most from the 'Obsolete' record really. 'Timelessness' also fell way short of being the heart-grabbing emotional climax it meant to be. This chorus here takes advantage of the premium production quality at their disposal, and of the band's hard-earned expertise of two whole decades and finally capitalizes on a facet that had arguably been one of their main flaws: having great verses and bridges, but a subpar chorus. This is what a top drawer futuristic sci-fi metal chorus sounds like: oddly enchanting, it feels like a warm organic memory amidst the robotic sonic strain, immersed deep in a digitized nostalgia, like a metal music depiction of that scene in the rain at the end of 'Blade Runner'. The perfect marriage between human (warmth) and computer (cold) music.\n\nSpeaking of the choruses, they're surely one of the top components of the record. Every single one of them is poignant in its own way and excellently arranged and produced. None of the choruses sound cheesy/radio-friendly or over-produced. Instead they all have an epic dimension to them and feel so very Fear Factory-like yet while expanding on their sound rather than rehashing older material.\n\nThe penultimate track, 'Metallic Division', is again exactly the sort of stuff that makes a great album: an instrumental track that straightens the melo atmosphere from the previous 'Designing the Enemy' in a typically Fear Factory rhythmic stomp. Having a solid instrumental there before the last track establishes a recognizable pattern for the album and provides the required variety and distinction between the different areas of 'Mechanize' to make the whole more organic and instinctive. The album's itinerary goes like this: the opener is unforgettable with its impossible aural violence, the next few tracks are super solid building blocks made from the prototypical 'Mechanize' cement. Right at the middle of the album, Track 5 'Christploitation' supplies the theatrics and the novelty in texture breaking away from the guitars/bass/drums/vocals paradigm, while the following couple of tracks bring that mid-journey freshness and oomph. The closing trio starts with one awe-inspiring emotionally intense track followed by a brief instrumental, and the album can now finish what it started with a song that simply does not leave one indifferent. \n\nA fitting end to a great and eventful journey, 'Final Exit' at worst perhaps feels a bit depressing with its most heavy atmosphere and lyrics. Bell has been strongly criticized over the years by some for his cleans, and rightfully so as they tend to sound clumsy or too flat/linear. Ironically for those critics, they work perfectly here as that linear almost robotic clean vocal style fits the surrounding instrumental and produces a peculiar effect as the vocal track feels sharply trimmed/edited and yet it sounds warm and heartening simultaneously as a part of Bell is noticeably pouring out of him. Just like 'Designing...', this track mixes ambient synths and arrangements with the heavy guitars/bass/drums and manage to steer the music towards the sentimental zone of the band's sound. The track is heavy music only as much as it is emotionally intense.\n\nJust when you thought Fear Factory were ready to accept they had pulled their sound in all the possible directions and at this point would just give in to the temptation of big sound over substance, they release 'Mechanize', an album loaded with character, nearly flawlessly structured and with every single song made to count and not a filler in sight. The inspiration here is vibrant with new life and an unbending willingness to conquer, as the album settles for no less than greatness as far as their own field allows it - its only limit virtually being the intrinsic reach of this blend of high-octane industrial post-thrash metal. This, two decades into their discography and past their 90's prime, really didn't need to be this good. But it is.\n",
        "\nWhenever one thinks of a band, they usually think of a particular sound from a particular album as being the essence of that band. 'Master of Puppets' for Metallica, 'Far Beyond' or 'Vulgar' for Pantera, arguably 'Deliverance' for Opeth, and so on. It's usually the third or fourth record in a band's discography simply because it takes time for a band to reach the point of maturity in song-writing and to nail the trademark sound for each instrument. With Fear Factory, 'Obsolete' was that record. The technology available towards the late 90s was harnessed perfectly for the record, along with each band member maturing as men and understanding better than ever what their role in the band was.\n\nSo if you think of Fear Factory: the band with dystopian lyrical subject matter and atmosphere, with super heavy slightly digital sounding guitars with staccato riffs locked in with triggered drum kicks and punctuated by hard snares, alternative metal passages for choruses or interludes, ultra aggressive parts taking turns with clean sung sections, ambient synths and samples... you'd be right on the money if you pulled out 'Obsolete'. \n\nNow for a bit of criticism: some chorus hooks are good in theory but were executed poorly. The best example of that is the opener, \"Shock\", where the chorus is just not on par with the intensity and quality of the intro (which is positively titanic). Burton C.Bell just going down the chromatic scale sounds uninspired and out of place, and it ends up sounding oddly happy in the end. Just a mistake for that avalanche of an opener, simply. Another would be the chorus to \"Securitron\". Fantastic track, and again great core melody for the chorus on paper, but it just sounds a bit botched. That same melody is played as the outro, on a synth this time, and it's one of the most touching moments on the album. So failing to organize the songs to get the most out of them is sometimes an issue. The end track, \"Timelessness\", is forgettable at best. The setting and all the atmospheric elements were there, with quality sounding strings, and being at the end of such a brutal record, had the opportunity to really seize the heart of the listener with a sentimental slow-motion type dirge, and yet, nobody ever mentions that track. Especially when compared to the previous album's excellent \"slow\" finale, \"A Therapy for Pain\". \"Hi-Tech Hate\" is yet another. Same symptom: strong song, subpar chorus. Good ideas there but a forgettable hook.\n\nIn opposition to that, the \"Salvation\" chorus to 'Smasher-Devourer' for example is super effective. It totally opens up the song, both melodically and in injecting energy to the dynamic plot of the track, and serves as the backbone to the song and riffs rather than the other way around for those aforementioned tracks. It should be said the album has a really nice catalog of various moods and genre blending. 'Freedom or Fire' brings a bit of that late 90's Godflesh/UK electronic music vibe while 'Descent' plays the role of the alternative metal F.F. song (a bit like 'Replica' on the previous album, or 'Linchpin' on the following record) as is often traditional with the band, and they're both done very tastefully in how they avoid sounding generic, and never step outside the album's identity.\n\nBut all in all, that Fear Factory came up with a blockbuster scifi metal album this accomplished, that explored this many areas and angles of the Obsolete sound is special. What other band during the late 90's were coming up with a record like 'Obsolete' ?\nWhich band could compare in style, massive sound production and intensity with tracks like 'Shock', 'Edge Crusher', 'Smasher-Devourer' or 'Resurrection' ?\n\nAn essential and unique chapter for metal music.\n",
        "\nFear Factory are one of the few bands that will forever carry within their very name a flavor unique to them that will have captured the hearts and minds of a few generations now. They really cannot be defined by just one genre label, unlike most other great bands, and what they're about musically and conceptually is totally distinct from anything around them.\n\nSo this album from 2015, some 20-25 years after their earliest inception as a group, in part supplies the same formula: robust one-note guitar riffs synced with the drum kicks along with machine-like hard-hitting snares, big blockbuster intros and bright melodic choruses, rich synths and samples to thicken the audio.\n\nHowever, it does what every FF record will do in providing a signature touch hard-coded to that album in particular, that sets it apart from the rest. This album generally gives a sense of greater modernity and although it is a return to the mid/late 90s and the Demanufacture and Obsolete albums in particular it manages to revive an older nostalgic sound all the while adapting it to contemporary technology and song-writing. A chorus like the one on \"Anodized\" might be better than any chorus written for Demanufacture, and just the opening track \"Autonomous Combat System\" seems better crafted, although in context not nearly as innovative and ground-breaking, than the opening track \"Demanufacture\". There's a definite feel the band has honed their craft and display better maturity here as on the earlier material.\n\nThe production is generally stellar and every instrument seems like it's been layered to burst, and composition wise overall they do a good enough job making the album a smooth ride and keeping each track fresh, including a few good enough to make a fan's all-time favorites list. Yes it's more Dino one-note robot riffing, but we're fed a nice variety of it molded into the impressive production and as always surrounded by the compelling arrangements that give each song character.\n\nThis album does contain the same flaws generally associated with FF: those being certain choruses that don't quite land (the single \"Dielectric\" for instance comparable to the chorus to the hit \"Shock\" - fine concept, weak execution and outcome), or certain quality melodies which they failed to produce great choruses from (\"Promotech\", a bit like the previous \"Securitron\" from Obsolete, both tracks ending with keys playing that melody), or of course one could still criticize the redundant nature of the riffing or particular patterns repeated from song to song (like the post-chorus on loop before returning to the verse).\n\nThe problem specific to this album might be the weaker quality of the middle to second half of the album. Certain tracks are just forgettable really (\"Church of Execution\", or the uninspired \"Regenerate\") and one might feel a sense of underachieved potential or perhaps dropped energy that carries the momentum down.\n\nThe album does contain one of the most special moments in many listeners' time discovering metal albums, and that's the final track \"Expiration Date\". It's somehow 100% Fear Factory, subject matter or musical feel, but completely recycled to be the least metal version of the band, but it works so utterly well. The bonus track \"Enhanced Reality\", also on the less metal side of their spectrum, might even be a one-up on the latter as it offers deep sorrowful atmosphere like rarely before in their songs, and showcases the versatility of the FF sound.\n\nAll in all, this album could've been better. It could've had a stronger set-list throughout instead of being disparate and inconsistent in quality. But it could've been so much worse too, as finding ways to reinvent the FF sound at this point seems not the simplest of tasks. Of course it doesn't quite have the magic of many of its predecessors, but that's to be expected being studio album no. 9; yet at the same time, it does not come across as innocuous like some of the other albums in that discography either and possess that expected bit of a special quality to it.\n",
        "\nFear Factory made it clear straight away when they released their first record in the early 90s that they cared very little about conventions and being put in a box. What good is it sticking a pejorative label like \"nu-metal\" on an album when it immediately stigmatizes the record before even being experienced ? It doesn't matter what influences are incorporated into the sound of a band, if the record in question just sounds good.\n\nIn terms of production, the record is quite stellar. The guitars have a gorgeous digital feel to them and are as close to perfectly equalized as I can imagine for this sort of tone. On the groovy riffs they're fat though articulate, abrasive yet smooth, and in perfect balance with the meaty/punchy drum kicks, on the alternative open string stuff they've got a glorious combination of thick distortion and perceptible accuracy. The bass is present but contributes to the overall rhythm section rather than stand out too much and the drums are hard-hitting and their sound harnessed through great processing like never before. The vocals are perfectly mixed as they both sit right at the front of the songs but somehow don't dominate them either as all the other instruments are perfectly audible. \n\nThe very subtle and diverse samples and synths used in each corner of the songs add atmosphere and texture, but are never overdone and never smother the main instruments. To the point one might not notice those arrangements if they're not consciously listening for them. They just blend in the environment and fill in the tracks efficiently and take just the right amount of focus away from the central robot riffing.\n\nIn terms of song-writing, the album consists of only good songs; \"good\" going by if you like the style of one song, you should appreciate the rest as it is as tastefully put together and executed. No filler on the album. No song sounds the same and we're given quite the repertoire of FF music as the tracks can range from very industrial-feeling, to rappy, to pure groove, poppy, or a little on the extreme side and bleak sounding. But the common denominator is that core Digimortal sound; i.e. the specific sounds of the guitars, drums, vocals; and it doesn't matter which part of the spectrum is being explored as all songs were given real attention and one can tell have been worked then reworked, and reworked some more. Lots of detail went into each song although it is seamless on the surface.\n\nInterestingly, one might argue the better tracks are on the second half of the record and among the lesser known ones. \n\nAnyways this sort of album, a bit on the overproduced side with concise catchy song-writing, is a joy to listen to. The verses are heavy as hell, fresh; the choruses range from melancholic (Linchpin, Never End) to poppy and catchy (Digimortal), to giant-sounding (Acres of Skin, Byte Block, Hurt Conveyor). The record sounds deep and wide, yet tight and punchy at the same time. It's so easy to listen to and if one can drop their preconceived notions, and just take the music for what it is - great fun can be had.\n",
        "\nThe year is 1992. A time when most of what would later constitute the foundations for metal was in the works. Death metal and grindcore were a thing, industrial metal and alternative metal were a thing, but all were in their embryonic stage and quite experimental at that point. Metal had really been for a decade, mostly, a traditional thrash/speed metal affair, with a couple odd bands pushing the boundaries out into the extreme.\n\nWhat's important to note for this review is most metal bands at the time had been utterly focused on the music, the sheer composition based on the guitar riff. Arrangements were not nearly a priority. On their first record here, Fear Factory put the emphasis on establishing a sound, a metal music concept. The songs were as much about the tone and sounds of the instruments, the arrangements and atmosphere, as about composition. Which is quite rare, and done here in a unique way, for a time when most bands in the field had little to no regard for components external to the riff. Metal was typically about a central guitar riff, leads and solos, and the bass/drums in the back and straightforward vocals on top. Instead Fear Factory incorporated industrial samples, ambiances, spoken word sequences or solo grindy bass parts during intros and breaks. \n\nThey were audacious enough to pull off a verse with no guitar or go to clean vocals with no transition right in the middle of a song (the opener Martyr), then to write a chorus with the same clean sung vocals on top of a heavy power chord section (Crisis)... all that as an extreme metal outfit. Very odd for that time period. At times it's unclear what the intention of a part even is; to be melancholic or heavy and badass; and somehow it doesn't come across as purely remote but bears a certain odd coherence to it, which only makes the album that bit more classic and rare.\n\nThe idea of locking in the syncopated guitar riffs with the drums, notably the staccato styled picking patterns with the double kicks, was beginning to establish itself here, although not as obvious as on the later records. The drums do display a complicity with the guitars already however as they form along with the bass one big unified rhythm section often recording the same pattern, where in other bands guitar riffs, bass and drums would all play something different. Hence, one of the major differences setting Fear Factory apart.\n\nAll in all the very idea of taking bands as obscure sounding as Godflesh and Napalm Death, mixing them together, and adding the trademark Dino robot riffs, along with melodic traces of alternative metal constituted such a novelty, such an incredibly fresh and potent musical concept that despite its cited influences, didn't quite sound like anything else. \nYes it had way too many tracks, could've used more definition for each song (most people only remember about 4 or 5 out of the 17) and was of course perfectible in many ways, but any flaw it may possess couldn't take away the cryptic magic that can be found on this record. It's so rare in how eclectic and unique it sounds, and carries all the charm of early 90s creative chaos and sheer aggression. It isn't overproduced, and it doesn't even try to be accessible as it obviously could've been conceived and packaged in a much more obvious and presentable way. It's just genuine, and unique. A rare instance of awkward brilliance.\n",
        "\nAfter Fear Factory made their second comeback with a very successful \u201cMechanize\u201d, they followed the album with \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d. Now, for the most part, \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d scored well enough with fans and critics alike given that it sounded like \u201cMechanize\u201d 2.0, which was not a bad thing mind you. With two albums under their belt since reforming, fans were excited to see that the band was preparing new material for what would be their 9th album (not including \"Concrete\") titled \u201cGenexus\u201d which released in August 2015.\n\nWhen \u201cMechanize\u201d was released, we saw the band revisit the sounds and formula of Fear Factory\u2019s past. You could hear bits and pieces of just about every major release through the album, which was a nice way to kick off their comeback. Subsequently, \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d followed suit, only rather the album seemed to stick to a tried and true formula that was more safe than anything else. That being said, with two albums playing true to the band\u2019s roots, the band would decide that it was time to take the next step and put out an album that would not only retain the classic Fear Factory formula, but also reach new heights. \u201cGenexus\u201d is exactly what the band had in mind. \n\nIf Fear Factory was going to add a new layer to their sound, they were going to have to make some changes to their current formula and the state of their lineup. The first order of business was to go out and get a new drummer, which they did by bringing on Mike Heller from the brutal death metal outfit, Malignancy. Previously, \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d saw a two-man act of Dino and Burton handling all the instruments, which required the drums to be programmed and while they were executed well enough, the human aspect was sorely missing. The other change that is not as widely recognized was the fact that, for the first time in his singing career, Burton decided to seek out help from a vocal coach to help him with a few issues he felt he was experiencing. As such, he began incorporating warm up exercises before live shows and recordings, which would ultimate allow him to overcome those concerning issues. It showed a new level of devotion towards creating the best music possible and it would pay off in dividends. With a new drummer and a new sense of dedication to their music, Fear Factory was preparing to put everything they had into \u201cGenexus\u201d, but intent is one thing, execution is another.\n\nAs for the execution of the music, I will say, confidently that \u201cGenexus\u201d is easily their most complete and sincere album since \u201cDemanufacture\u201d. I\u2019m not saying that it is better than \u201cObsolete\u201d or \u201cArchetype\u201d (which could easily be debated, but not now). What I\u2019m saying is, when the band changed from a quasi-industrial death metal act into the cyber metal powerhouse we heard on \u201cDemanufacture\u201d it required a great deal of change, commitment and execution. That is exactly what has happened from the transition of \u201cMechanize\u201d (and \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d) into \u201cGenexus\u201d. You can hear how much time, effort and dedication they put into this album with each passing song. The emotion in the vocals, the energy put forth in each of the instruments, even the crew behind the scenes in the programming and electronics department put in a great deal of time and focus to create the fresh and genuine sound on \u201cGenexus\u201d. What we have here is not so much an album staying true to its roots, but an album that took everything in its 25-year history and combined all those elements into a showing of wisdom and mastery. It\u2019s one thing to simply utilize elements from previous albums, but it\u2019s another to take those elements and make them into something both familiar and unique. \n\nSince beginning his consultations with the vocal coaches, Burton\u2019s vocals have been elevated to new heights. Now, not everyone can sound the same at age 45 as they did when they were 20 (Although Rob Halford sounds pretty good for nearly 70), but Bell\u2019s voice on \u201cGenexus\u201d reminds me more of his early \u201cDemanufacture\u201d and \u201cObsolete\u201d days more than any other album. His harsh vocals are so much more prominent and sharp, more so than either of the two previous releases. He delivers more midrange vocals, which serve as a nice build up to his majestic cleans. The cleans on \u201cGenexus\u201d are some of the best he\u2019s ever sung. They are high, clear and compelling on many of the songs that leave you simply in awe. The ending of \u201cRegenerate\u201d nearly brought tears to my eyes, as his soaring vocals left me completely floored. It\u2019s impressive to actually hear the payoff of all the dedication Bell put into enhancing his voice after all these years. \n\nWith Dino on guitars, we know we\u2019re in for some crunchy, groovy, chugging riffs. However, with the sense of a fresh sound, even Dino understood that just simply going back to the well would not be good enough. Yes, we still have those crushing riffs, but their sound on \u201cGenexus\u201d sounds almost as if Dino\u2019s writing had been rejuvenated, as we haven\u2019t heard such mechanical, cybernetic and pulsating riffs since \u201cDemanufacture\u201d. The power and energy on the guitars are far more intense than \u201cMechanize\u201d and they actually add more rhythm than normal. Dino also mans the bass once again, which is nothing new, but with his renewed sense of guitar work, he would have to ensure that the bass did not lull into the background either. Now, I\u2019ll say that the bass is not as front and center as it was on \u201cArchetype\u201d or \u201cTransgression\u201d for that matter, but the atmosphere on \u201cGenexus\u201d really doesn\u2019t require an in your face bass. That\u2019s not to say you don\u2019t notice it, as many times the bass can be heard, bouncing along with the guitars creating a nice harmonizing flow. \u201cSoulhacker\u201d displays a heavy dosage of thick, groovy bass that enhances not only the guitars, but also gives a nice punch to the chorus as well.\n\nWith Mike Heller on board, the human element lacking from \u201cThe Industrial\u201d had returned. Now, I had heard a few Malignancy albums in the past, but they were before Heller\u2019s tenure with the band, so I wasn\u2019t sure of his capabilities. I figured if Dino and Burton were serious about injecting new life into the band and \u201cGenexus\u201d they would do their homework and find the right drummer to fill the void. My concerns were put to rest as Heller displays not only that he can handle the drums required to carry the Fear Factory sound, but provides more on \u201cGenexus\u201d. The song writing really comes through on the drums as you, can hear portions of the bands entire discography throughout the album. The power, speed, depth, tempo and intensity of each track takes elements as far back as \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d up to \u201cMechanize\u201d and are combined to create the monstrous sound we hear on \u201cGenexus\u201d. Aside from their concussive force, the drums, as usual serve as a key component in creating the rhythms and directional force of the album and when they gel together with Dino\u2019s guitar and bass, they form a wonderful harmony. \n\nI mentioned that everyone involved with \u201cGenexus\u201d stepped their game up a notch and that held true to those in the programming and additional crew department. Most notably, Rhys Fulber, who adds his dystopian enhancements to every aspect of the album. From Burton\u2019s vocals, to Dino\u2019s guitars and Heller\u2019s drums, Fulber\u2019s touch can be heard consistently throughout \u201cGenexus\u201d proving why I\u2019ve always considered his addition to be the \u201c12th\u201d man of the band. His magic behind the scenes is simply irreplaceable and I truly believe without his inclusion, the band would have never attained the sound they have accomplished. \n\n\u201cGenexus\u201d was slated to be a step in the direction of a new future for Fear Factory. With the amount of preparation, dedication and emotion the band put into the making of this album, it\u2019s no surprise that \u201cGenexus\u201d in my opinion, one of the best albums in Fear Factory\u2019s long and celebrated catalog. With high expectations, the band exceeded those expectations and went above and beyond anything that fans were prepared for. This album is a testament to what can be accomplished when creative minds put their heads together, and put forth a massive amount of effort, while puting one\u2019s heart and soul into an album. \u201cGenexus\u201d is simply a display of superb songwriting, excellent musicianship and the culmination of years of experience and maturity put onto an album. If this is the future of Fear Factory, the future is indeed bright my friends.\n\n(Be sure to check out the digipak which contains two interesting tracks; \"Mandatory Sacrifice\" (Genexus Remix) and \"Enhanced Reality\")\n\nHighlights: \"Anodized\" \"Dielectric\" \"Protomech\" \"Regenerate\"\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nBefore being known to the world as, Fear Factory, the band briefly followed the moniker of Ulceration. Now, the story goes, the band wasn't happy with the record deal they had in place and decided to part ways with their producer. Years later, after the band would split up, certain contract obligations called for the band to meet their required number of releases and since the rights to the album belonged to Ross Robinson (the original producer), \"Concrete was released in 2002 in lieu of an original album.\n\n\"Concrete\" is essentially, the original songs the band recorded under the name of Ulceration, songs that would be re-recorded and appear on \"Soul of a New Machine\". The \"album\" as it is perceived, is little more than a complication of original recordings and bonus tracks. Of the 16 tracks, 9 are the original versions of what you hear on \"Soul of a New Maine\", while a few others were either bonus tracks that found their way onto future re-releases and a couple unreleased tracks.\n\n\u201cConcrete\u201d may serve as a history of the band, but other than simple curiosity, the album offers little in the way of anything interesting to new, but especially to long time fear Factory fans. Robinson's ideas on how the original tracks should have sounded were widely despised by fans of the \"Soul of a New Machine\" recordings (as well as two original tracks slated for \"Demanufacture\".) The sound, for the most part, is on par with what a demo would sound like. The instruments sound distant, the vocals are even rougher than they sounded on \"Soul of a New Machine\" and ultimate, sound like an incomplete product. The couple bonus tracks that appeared on \"Obsolete\" are nothing new (given they are on the digipak of said album) and the few unreleased recordings were unreleased for a reason. They suffer the same flaws as the other Robinson tracks and offer little to even die hard Fear Factory fans. \n\nAll in all, this may have been the album Ulceration was slated to release years ago, but after one listen to \"Concrete\" and you\u2019ll understand why the band decided to head in a different direction from the one they were traveling. This release is the definition of meeting the record labels requirements, as it offers little more than a glimpse of what might have been, but thankfully never was.\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nDigital Connectivity is a collection of live performances, music videos, band interviews and various bits of informative clips recorded from 1993-2001. At the time, it covered the majority of their career, but sadly it would be the final collaboration as the band would inevitably part ways shortly after this video release. \n\nAs far as the material goes, it is a very entertaining bag of mixed goodies. The video plays almost like a documentary, in that it follows the band in chronological order from their days on \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d up to \u201cDigimortal\u201d. Throughout the video, we get to see live performances from each albums time period, each capturing the essence of the band with arguably the most popular of songs from each of the four albums. The live sets themselves are handpicked, I would imagine, to offer the best experience and impact from a live showing. Aspects such as sound quality, band interaction and crowd reaction are important ingredients for a successful live showing and as such, each of the live performances exude as much.\n\nHowever, this is not simply collection of live shows. As I said, there are other elements such as official videos for \"Replica\", \"Resurrection\" and \"Linchpin\". there are interviews with each of the band members that offer a lot of insight into the mindsets of each musician and really help show how they vision and imagine their sound. There are showcases of the band working in and out of the studio, preparing for both live shows and recorded material and then there are random clips ranging from the members goofing off, to telling a story or just showing them in random situations. Everything is woven throughout the live showings to give the video the documentary feel, which plays smoothly from start to finish and never feels as though it drags. There are even musical bonus tracks (at the time unreleased, but since have all been released on various albums and comps), which only sweetened the deal, leaving any fan of Fear Factory more than satisfied. \n\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\n2010\u2019s \u201cMechanize\u201d was a resounding success to both fans and critics alike and marked the beginning of the third era of Fear Factory. After two years of touring and songwriting, the band would put together the follow up in the form of \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d. Now, when \u201cTransgression\u201d was released, fans were at worst, hoping it to be \u201cArchetype\u201d 2.0, but were disappointed with the industrial rock experiment they received. If I had to sum of the comparison to the bands second comeback album \u201cMechanize\u201d to their follow up \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d I would say that it is, more or less, Mechanize\u201d 2.0.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear. When I say 2.0, I don\u2019t simply mean that the songs on \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d sound exactly the same as they did on \u201cMechanize\u201d. The similarities lie in the song structure and overall atmosphere that the albums share. Yes, one could argue that many of the songs could easily be interchangeable from album to album, but for fans of either album I ask; is that a bad thing? One might say that many 80\u2019s thrash or melodic death metal share so many similarities within their own catalog that the same interchangeable aspects could be applied, but we all know that Slayer and Megadeth create individual albums despite sharing similar traits from album to album. \n\nPerhaps the biggest reason for attaining the 2.0 label, in my opinion would have to be the fact that Fear Factory were now a two-man operation. That\u2019s right, this album (main players that is) features only Burton and Dino. Dino, once again handles the bass and guitar duties and Bell on vocals, which left one question? Who\u2019s on Drums? Well, the answer would be no one technically, as the drums on this album would be programmed, but we\u2019ll get into that soon enough.\n\n\u201cThe Industrialist\u201d is a prime example of following a working formula. I\u2019m reminded of Powerwolf in that, you know the formula of Powerwolf if you\u2019re a fan and if you are indeed a fan, knowing they follow a formula isn\u2019t a problem. The music on \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d simply follows the successful formula we saw on \u201cMechanize\u201d. Burton\u2019s vocals continue to flourish with his harsh and clean combination. They are just as powerful and crisp as they were on the previous album and can easily hook the listener. Dino\u2019s guitars chug along, creating groove laden riffs and leads that are both energetic and mechanical in nature. The bass is thick and bouncy, which lends a nice punch when harmonizing with the other instruments. The song structures are also very formulaic. Songs follow a harsh and intense set of vocal leads, which build into catchy and clean choruses that leave a lasting impression. The drums pound away, creating a wall of sound and rhythm that lend but to the intensity of the album, but also help deliver the force of each track. Finally, Rhys Fulber and company once again, add the programming, keyboards and industrial touches that have always been the band\u2019s shtick. As I said, everything fits the components of the formula and they fit rather nicely. \n\nNow, I mentioned the drumming and how on this album they would be programmed. To start, I have heard a number of one-man death and black metal bands employ the use of a programmed drum machine and while sometimes it\u2019s so obvious that it becomes almost a hindrance, other times it can sound seamless. Given Fear Factory\u2019s history of electronics and programming, I was more than confident that they would be able to handle the task of programming the drums to meet their needs. I for one prefer a human on the drums, but in a pinch, programming can get the job done. The result on \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d is a powerful sounding experience, but comes off as soulless. It\u2019s not completely obvious, but once you hear them, you\u2019ll notice the human touch is missing. Although it doesn\u2019t take away from the drum\u2019s effect, it certainly doesn\u2019t add the human magic that Herrera or Hoglan added either. For one album (as Mike Heller would join shortly after the album\u2019s release) the programming here is acceptable. \n\nCompared to the follow up of Fear Factory\u2019s initial comeback release (\u201cTransgression\u201d), \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d is head and shoulders above said album. Perhaps the band rested upon the cyber metal formula a little too heavily on this album, but by this point in the game, they know the style of music they play, they\u2019re comfortable playing it and have figured out how to recreate that sound. Again, it works for bands like Powerwolf (whom I love) who has had excellent success and the formula works just as well here.\n\nHighlights: \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d \u201cRecharger\u201d \u201cNew Messiah\u201d\n\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nThe bitter taste that was left in most people\u2019s mouth after 2005\u2019s \u201cTransgression\u201d was more than palpable within the metal community. After such a strong comeback with 2004\u2019s \u201cArchetype\u201d most were left shaking their heads with the follow up. Many thought that, perhaps, the band might put their collective minds together and produce an album to redeem themselves, but sadly, that was not the case. Shortly after the release of \u201cTransgression\u201d the band announced they were going on a hiatus to work on various side gigs and projects the members had their hands in. Herrera and Wolbers created a band called Arkaea, and Bell began recording tracks in a number of side projects/guest appearances, which only furthered the hiatus. By 2008, most thought that the band had officially split up as, other than rumors, there was not much in the way of hope for fans. \n\nHowever, in 2009, an article stated that the band would indeed be getting back together and would feature both Bell and Dino. Apparently, the two had put aside their differences and reunited, but due to internal disputes (no details in this review) both Herrera and Wolbers would not be returning. On one hand, the notion of Fear Factory reuniting again was big news and even more so that Dino was back. On the other, losing Wolbers and Herrera lead to some concerns. Byron Stroud was slated to return on bass, which was reassuring, but that left the void of the drums, an aspect of the band\u2019s sound that simply cannot be overlooked. Well, in a good PR move, the band made a special announcement that the drums would be fronted by none other than the legend, Gene Hoglan (Death, Death Angel and Dark Angel). The loss of Herrera was tough, but if you\u2019re going to replace someone on his level than it better be with someone that will be able to fill those shoes and with Hoglan\u2019s announcement, fans\u2019 worries were put to ease. \n\nNow, for a successful second comeback, \u201cMechanize\u201d would need to have the same impact \u201cArchetype\u201d had after the band\u2019s initial split, but would also have to capture the cyber metal power and aggression from the days of old. I\u2019m sure if this was nothing more than \u201cArchetype\u201d 2.0 people might not be too upset, but with Dino and Burton back together along with Hoglan on board, fans wanted a fresh sound with the classic elements up front and center, not a rehash. Fortunately, \u201cMechanize\u201d would have the comeback power of \u201cArchetype\u201d, while capturing elements of their work on both \u201cDemanufacture\u201d and \u201cObsolete\u201d.\n\nRight from the get go, \u201cMechanize\u201d starts off with the titular track, harnessing the aggressive nature we heard with \u201cCyberwaste\u201d. It\u2019s pulsating, fierce and exudes with anger and violence. \u201cIndustrial Discipline\u201d carries the classic harsh leads and clean vocals fear factory built their name on since \u201cDemanufacture\u201d. The classic cyber metal formula of harsh and clean vocals, chugging riffs and breakneck drums are all present, from start to finish. The industrial sound is only enhanced by each of the instrumentation, playing with rhythm and harmony that not only function like a machine, but at times, give off a machine like sound. \n\nBell\u2019s vocals are back in full effect. His harsh vocals sound much more crisp and to the point, even more so than they were on \u201cArchetype\u201d. His cleans are as euphoric as normal, only with the hint of programming, they give them an extra machine like touch that help create pleasant choruses and memorable notes. Unlike \u201cTransgression\u201d Bell unloads his pent up aggression upon the listener and those who waited patiently for another punishing display of vocal ferocity, you won\u2019t be disappointed with \u201cMechanize\u201d. I gave a special nod to the track \u201cEcho of My Scream\u201d on \u201cTransgression\u201d, which put Bell\u2019s vocals in a more emotional spotlight. \u201cFinal Exit\u201d has that same feel to its makeup and when you listen to it, you truly feel the emotion in Bell\u2019s voice. It\u2019s a welcome addition to mark an end of such an intense album. \n\nWith Dino back on guitars for the first time since. \u201cDigimortal\u201d fans immediately could hear the bouncy grooves that Dino had created since the days of \u201cSoul of a New Machine.\u201d The crunchy riffs carry the machine like nature that is undeniably, Dino. This sound had been missing from both \u201cArchetype\u201d and \u201ctransgression\u201d and although the former did not suffer from as much, the latter did not fare well. In any case, the powerful leads have returned to help shape the skeleton of the bands structure. Of course, there isn\u2019t much in the way of solos, which is nothing new, but at times there are passages that create an almost solo experience, but instead of stepping into the spotlight, they accentuate the overall mood and compliment the sound, rather than stand out. In any case, his guitar work is a welcome addition to the comeback.\n\nByron Stroud\u2019s work on \u201cTransgression\u201d was one of the few shining points the album had to offer instrumentation wise. With a lack of solos or much in the way of guitar fills, the bass, drums and guitars play as a cohesive unit in order to create a homogenized rhythm section, which requires each instrument to carries its own weight. This is more than accomplished by Stroud as his thick and reverberated chords both stand out when they need to, but also harmonizes nicely to form the team effort on rhythms.\n\nGene Hoglan needs no introduction. The man is a legend in the metal community. As I said, learning the Herrera would be absent from \u201cMechanize\u201d made me worry, but as soon as I heard Hoglan would be filling in, I knew there was nothing to worry about. The drums have always been the pulse of Fear Factory. They have always driven the songs forward, added to the rhythms that the guitars lack and created a mechanical power that gave their sound a distinction of industrial nature. Hoglan understood this concept and set out to not only stay true to the mantra the drums held in Fear Factory\u2019s past, but also added his only fierce and emetic touch. The result; a rapid fire displays of blast, beast, bass kicks and cymbal crashes, but they are played with such fluidity and skill that they are not merely a mash up of sound and loud noises. Hoglan uses a variety of tempos and rhythms that allow him to create an ebb and flow rhythmic base that anchors the sound of \u201cMechanize\u201d while also playing together nicely with Dino and Stroud. \n\nOf course, Rhys Fulber is back for more key programming and electronic touches that have given the band so much of its industrial identity, I don\u2019t;\u2019 think they would not have had the success they have had without him. Sometimes the smallest additions can have big impacts and with Fulber, it shows. \n\nFear Factory\u2019s second come back was just as successful and served as just as much of a fresh breath of air as \u201cArchetype\u201d. Although the atmospheres of each album are respectively both unique and on par with the style the band plays, \u201cMechanize\u201d seems to drive home the intensity a little more, straight forward. Once again, the worries of fans would be put to rest and this time, the band seems to be back for good.\n\nHighlights: \u201cMechanize\u201d \"Industrial Discipline\" \"Powershifter\" \"Final Exit\"\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nAfter the widely successful comeback of 2004\u2019s \u201cArchetype\u201d, Fear Factory immediately began working on material for a follow up album. With \u201cArchetype\u201d in the books and \u201cDigimortal\u201d in the rearview mirror, fans were eager to hear what would follow after such a strong showing. As information began to circulate about the ideas and concepts on this, at the time, untitled album, fans began to note the word experiment being used more often than not, which left them unsure of what to expect. Experimentation can be a double-edged sword in the music industry. On one hand, it can open sounds and ideas for a band to create a successful change of sound and experience. On the other hand, it can lead to a mash up of ill-gotten and mismanaged components that can leave a bad taste in the mouth of critics and fans alike. Given that Fear Factory had just reformed and had begun touring, one couldn\u2019t help but feel a little uneasy about an experimental album dropping after having reformed a year or so prior. In August of 2005, 16 months after \u201cArchetype\u201d, \u201cTransgression\u201d hit the shelves. \n\nNow, much like \u201cDigimortal\u201d, I\u2019m going to review this album from both a guy who listens to metal and a fan boy of Fear Factory. \n\nSo, where do we begin? Well, for starters, \u201cTransgression\u201d is what I would call experimental in that, it plays more to the tune of a heavier hard rock album with touches of industrial rock, and just a splash of heavy metal. For fans expecting the cyber metal assault they had just experienced on \u201cArchetype\u201d would be nowhere to be found. In fact, other than perhaps elements of \u201cDigimortal\u201d, this album hardly resembles much of any of their previous works other than the underlying industrial atmosphere and a few songs that retain their cyber metal roots. \n\nAs I said, the sound on \u201cTransgression\u201d is more or less a very tamed sounding industrial rock. Right from the get go, the opening track \u201c540,000\u00b0 Fahrenheit\u201d begins with a very simplified guitar lead, that builds into the chorus giving off an almost progressive vibe, but the payoff lacks usual lasting power Fear Factory general delivers in such situations. The same formula carries over into the next track \u201cTransgression\u201d and pretty much follows suit until the final song (on the non-enhanced album) \u201cMovement of impact\u2019. This is the only song I would say is a true, industrial heavy metal song in vain of the sound of Fear Factory had been playing up to this point. \n\nOn \u201cArchetype\u201d Dino had left the band and Christian Olde Wolbers assumed the role of guitar duties. He exceeded many expectations and left people satisfied that he was more than capable of continuing onward as the band began their second stint. I remember having some serious doubts when I learned Wolbers was taking over for Dino. My biggest concern was that the guitars would become stale, dumbed down and lose their impact they normally had on the band\u2019s music, but I was pleasantly happy to be wrong. That being said, those concerns would ultimately and unfortunately become a reality, only on the follow up to \u201cArchetype\u201d. The guitars here do not resemble any of the impact, power or crunchy riffs heard previously and in fact, they lack much depth for even a simple industrial rock sound. The guitars are honestly barely noticeable and rarely leave an imprint on the songs if any at all. \n\nI will say that, the drums are, as always, on point with Raymond Herrera playing. They may not be as bombastic and soul crushing as they usually are, but they provide the majority of rhythms and beats while offering some of the few metal moments on the album. The bass, which is now handled by Strapping Young Lad\u2019s, Byron Stroud, actually has much more of an impact that the guitars. The sound is thick and groovy and is generally in the foreground of the songs, which provides some additional rhythm with the drums. They are featured more so because the guitars were left out, so some form of guitar had to step up to the plate and handle something in the way of leads. Burton C. Bell\u2019s vocals have always been a favorite of mine. Unfortunately, his trademark style of harsh and clean vocals is for the most part absent from \u201cTransgression\u201d and instead we receive a heavy dosage of soft, mellow tones. We are treated with an occasional shout and hoarse passage that tries to convey some hostility, but generally comes up short. That lack of his aggressive style combined with his high choruses were sorely missed on the album.\n\nAll in all, this album failed to meet the expectations that not only Fear Factory fans had hoped, but left a sour taste in metal enthusiast alike. Experimentation is one thing, especially if you want to throw in a few songs with that mindset, but an entire album, especially so soon after reforming, was not the best of ideas. Aside from a few passable tracks, there\u2019s not much of Fear Factory\u2019s DNA to be found.\n\nOkay. Devil\u2019s advocate is finished, Now it\u2019s time for fan boy.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, after my first listen of \u201cTransgression\u201d I was a little disappointed. I mean, with \u201cArchetype\u201d having just been released a year prior, I figured at worse, this would be essentially \u201cArchetype\u201d 2.0. Being a Fear Factory fanatic, I was expecting the groovy and crunching guitars, machine gun drums and Burton\u2019s blend of harsh and clean vocals to inspire visions of industrialist robotic warfare, but, that was obvious not the case and I was left wondering just what kind of album \u201cTransgression\u201d really was? I remember my initial disappointment, as I would image most fans had experienced, but there was a part of me that couldn\u2019t give up on the band and had to try and unravel the mystery of this out of place album.\n\nNow, as most know, my love for Burton\u2019s vocals are unwavering. I enjoy everything he\u2019s a part of including Ascension of the Watchers and City of Fire (side bands), so as long as he is singing, I\u2019m going to find some enjoyment on that album. Knowing this the second time around, I dove back into the album and began to focus on the one element I knew I could find the most positive out of and that\u2019s exactly how I began to digest the album. Granted that Bell\u2019s harsh vocals are used sparingly, he does employ more midrange and mellow sound in their place. \u201c540,000\u00b0 Fahrenheit\u201d shows off this midrange lead, which builds into a beautiful and soaring chorus of his high cleans. On the titular track, we do hear him use a slightly harsher tone of voice that once again, leads to a clean chorus. This pretty much continues for the majority of the record, but there is one particularly song that stands out. \u201cEcho of My Scream\u201d might be considered a ballad of sorts as it shows Bell singing in an almost acapella format, that drips with emotion and is beautifully executed. Also, I enjoyed their rendition of U2\u2019s \u201cI will Follow\u201d and Killing Joke\u2019s \u201cMillennium\u201d, both bands who are influences on Fear Factory.\n\nTo this day, the guitars of \u201cTransgression\u201d are in my opinion the worst showing Fear Factory has put forth. I\u2019ve always defended them by pointing out that they do not use the guitars to create as much atmosphere as most bands, but rather use them to enhance the mechanical vibe of the albums, provide a steady and catchy lead, while harmonize with the other instruments. Those characteristics are simply not found on \u201cTransgression\u201d and while still disappointed, I eventually began to overlook the lack of guitars and focus more on Bell\u2019s vocals. I mean, the guitars are still present, and provide a simple Nu metal riff for most songs, but I can\u2019t give them too much praise other than their production is at least crisp and audible. \n\nSo my question remained: \u201cWhat kind of album is \u201cTransgression\u201d? Well, I\u2019d have to say that yes, this was an attempt to experiment with sounds of industrial rock, Nu metal, radio rock, with just a hint of heavy metal. At first it was hard to digest, but once I began to follow the lines that went outside of the box, I found much to enjoy. I find that for one to enjoy this experiment, you\u2019ll need to keep an open mind. If you love Bells\u2019 clean vocals over a backdrop of dark, and brooding atmospheres with a twinge of electronic edge (thank you Rhys Fulber), I think you\u2019ll be able to appreciate this album for the curveball it is. It\u2019s simplistic nature in both vocals and instrumentation may be looked upon as weak, but I view it as deceptively simple. The deception lies in the notion that, there are many elements to be enjoyed on \u201cTransgression\u201d, but like a good riddle, one will first need to unravel its mystery before they can begin to do so. Also, there are bonus tracks available (\u201cEmpire\u201d & \u201cMy Grave\u201d) both which are pretty solid tracks that fit the sound of this album nicely. \n\nMuch like \u201cDigimortal\u201d I would give this a higher rating simply due to my fanybosim, but I cannot overlook the flaws to which the album contains so my score will reflect a middle of the road agreement of my two overviews. \n\nHighlights: \u201c540,000\u00b0 Fahrenheit\u201d \u201cEcho of My Scream\u201d \u201cSpinal Compression\u201d\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nWhen Fear Factory announced that they were disbanding, I was crushed. My favorite band was to be no more. For a few years, the internet was filled with rumors of the band reforming, but none ever actually materialized. More of my hopes were dashed when I learned that two new releases were slated for 2002 and 2003 respectively, although they would be compilation albums, which, on the surfer were interesting, but new material they were not. Then, after reading an article in an issue of Brave Words and Bloody Knuckles, I saw a blurb that mentioned that Fear Factory was indeed reforming and would put out a new album in the Spring of 2004. I, of course, didn\u2019t want to get my hopes up, but when the band confirmed the news on their website, I was elated. It had only been three years since the release of \u201cDigimortal\u201d, which in hindsight, is not long between studio releases. However, the wound of the breakup was still raw, which made the wait seem much longer. The anticipation was almost too much to bear as more and more details emerged about the new album until, finally, \u201cArchetype\u201d hit the shelves.\n\n\u201cArchetype\u201d would mark a new chapter for the band, both creatively and lineup wise, as this would be the first release without Dino. His absence was a result of some inter-feuding with Burton and others, which led to the initial break up, but we\u2019re not going to go into detail of all that here. The change would shift the responsibilities of songwriting and guitars to Christian Olde Wolbers, who had played bass on the previous two albums and would record the bass tracks in studio. The situation is similar to how Dino handled the task on the first two albums. This was a tall order to tend to, as Dino\u2019s touch on both the creative side and guitar playing would not be easy to replace. Fortunately, the band decided not to simply try and replicate Dino\u2019s sound and instead, move forward with a fresh take on their cyber metal infused industrial act. \n\nNow, I must admit, I had my doubts about Wolbers taking over such a vital aspect of the band, but I\u2019m proud to admit, that I was a fool to do so. The music on \u201cArchetype\u201d both captures the essence of the band\u2019s past mantra, while also inviting a more modern sound, but by no means is it formulaic or vanilla, if you get my drift. The guitars offer plenty of crunch and groovy riffs, many of which are dark and moody. The lead in the opener \u201cSlave Labor\u201d showcases the simple, yet effective nature of said brooding riffs as many consider the song to be one of their most unique. \u201cCyberwaste\u201d turns the guitars up a notch and shows Wolbers capability to play a more fierce and energetic sound, creating both the angst and rebellious nature of the song. Throughout the album, he plays a variety of catchy riffs that are both memorable and act as a binder for the overall sound, harnessing the industrial sound Fear Factory play so well. \n\nIn addition to the guitars, his bass playing is on full display, often delivering huge and crunchy notes that harmonize with the guitars very nicely. The thick tone offers a nice addition to the layered sound on \u201cArchetype\u201d offering a mechanical punch to the overall atmosphere. I suppose manning both duties and having more songwriting responsibilities gave him the ability to showcase his talents, which at the end of the day, were on full display.\n\nRaymond Herrera\u2019s drums, once again are a work of art on this album. His precision beats, destructive blasts and machine gun bass kicks give \u201cArchetype\u201d an attitude the screams power and command your attention. His style has always offered a mechanical like sound to the makeup of the band, and his tempos and rhythms he puts forth on this release shows just how vital a drummer is to a successful band, especially one that can play a variety of tempos and adjust his sound accordingly from album to album. \n\nOf course, one cannot forget Burton C. Bell and his household blend of harsh and clean vocals. As usual, Bell\u2019s harsh vocals are rooted in violence, contempt and anger as the blaze forth and ignite a sound of fury that was missing from the likes of \u201cDigimortal\u201d. \u201cCyberwaste\u201d showcases the attitude his voice carries, while on songs such as \u201cSlave Labor\u201d, \u201cBite the Hand That Bleeds\u201d and \u201cAct of God\u201d shows his ability to carry more mid-leveled ranged vocals. His cleans are once again, crisp and mesmerizing, which leads to a number a catchy and memorable choruses on many of the songs. \n\nMr. Unofficial, Rhys Fulber, would once more add a heavy dose of keys, programming and electronics that help darken the mood of the album, while maintaining the industrial spirit of \u201cArchetype\u201d. Of course, Fulber is not always alone in the programming and effects department however, he has been a mainstay since 1993 and his influence has long been a key factor for the band, which is why I always give him an additional tip of my cap.\n\nAlthough perhaps not so much a comeback album as much as it is a reload, \u201cArchetype\u201d was a welcome breath of fresh air for both longtime fans and metal heads alike. And with that, Fear Factory was back in full force. Fans\u2019 concerns of a permeant break up were put to rest and the band had already announced they were working on new material. The was looking bright, but for how long\u2026.\n\nHighlights: \u201cSlave Labor\u201d \u201cCyberwaste\u201d \u201cArchetype\u201d \u201cUndercurrent\u201d \u201cDrones\u201d\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nShortly after 2002\u2019s album \u201cConcrete\u201d, which was to appease Roadrunner Records\u2019 album number requirement the band had agreed upon, another such release would follow in the form of a compilation known as, \u201cHatefiles\u201d. Now, the major difference between the two obligatory releases is that \u201cConcrete\u201d was essentially the songs that appeared on \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d, but the unfiltered versions of those songs recorded under the \u201cUlceration\u201d banner. That, along with a few other demos and a couple unrealized tracks made \u201cConcerete\u201d more of a compilation of demos and rough recordings as opposed to an album. \u201cHatefiles\u201d on the other hand, is a straight compilation, composed of unreleased and remixed tracks.\n\nTo those unfamiliar, Fear Factory has hand a hand in movie soundtracks as well as video game soundtracks, some of which I had never heard or realized until the release of \u201cHatefiles\u201d. The first four tracks are from the video game world, \"Terminator: Dawn of Fate\", \u201cFrequency\u201d and \u201cDemolition Racer\u201d to be exact, none of which I played in the past. They are solid tracks, that perhaps do not sound like they could be a part of any particular Fear Factory album, they do however, carry they Fear Factory sound. The songs' industrial nature and thick, groovy atmosphere make these songs a welcome addition fan any Fear Factory fan.\n\nThe next two are radio edits of previous songs \"Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies)\"and \u201cResurrection\u201d. Now, \u201cResurrection\u201d has a nice change up to its sound, retaining it's core, but is more condensed and shortened to give more impact. but the edit of \"Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies) the Suture Remix\u201d is one of my favorite Fear Factory songs of all time. I enjoyed the original version on Digimortal, but remix has some much more emotion and spunk to its sound that I always learn toward it before the original. The song was also featured on the Resident Evil Soundtrack. \n\nThe rest of the tracks are techno versions of previous songs similar to \u201cFear is the Mindkiller\u201d or \u201cRemanufacture\u201d, a demo and a live track. Of the entire collection, I found the video game tracks, the radio edits and the lone demo (\"Dark Bodies\") to be the most interesting. The techno remixes are saturated with heavy dosages of electronic and synthesizers that give the original recordings a bouncy and dance club vibe to them, so fans of such should find a little goodness here as well.\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nBy 2001, the Nu metal phenomenon was in full effect and had gained a strangle hold on the music world. Every radio station and music video show on television was dominated with their brand of pseudo metal that, whether you love it or hate it, had its effect on the metal community. Even the likes of the Big Four of thrash all had their hands in the Nu metal scene at one point or another. Now, for some bands, incorporating elements of the Nu metal sound was a complete 180 to their sound and as such, came as a shock to their fan base. Others, the transition was less of a hassle. One such band that also jumped on the bandwagon was Fear Factory with their release of \u201cDigimortal\u201d and although their entry into the Nu metal arena may not have been accepted with open arms, the final result was not a drastic change from many of the elements the band already played. \n\nNow, I\u2019m going to view \u201cDigimortal\u201d through the eyes of both a fan of the band and a guy reviewing an album. From the eyes of a non-biased fan, I will say that, the sound on \u201cDigimortal\u201d is very simplistic in both execution and talent. That was, essentially one of the staples of the Nu metal movement: focus less on music and more or attitude and emotion. It required a very monotonous and uncomplicated guitar sound, C-rate drumming and often dabbled into the realm of hip hop. All of which will be present on \u201cDigimortal\u201d To be fair, the basic industrial and electronic sounds that the band have always used were still present, but they come through more like a low fat version of Fear Factory.\n\nAs I said, musically, the sound is rather bland. The guitars riffs are even more simplified than their usual selves, the drumming is far from the powerful wall of sound it should be and the bass, although present, is not as harmonious as it was on \u201cObsolete\u201d. The industrial elements that are on display don't add as much to the atmosphere as much as they did on the band\u2019s previous works. Where then, they helped make up the DNA of the album, here they simply sound as though they were added just for the sake of adding them to keep their industrial tag. The use of turntables on \"Edgecrusher\" back on \"Obsolete\" was eye raising, but understanding Wolber's affinity to the sound and being a personal hobby of his, it was acceptable. The rap song \"Back the Fuck Up\", well, it may feature B-Real, a legendary figure in the hip-hop scene, but the song did not go over well with fans. All in all, a miss compared to the previous two releases, but by no means a complete bomb. \n\nOkay, now that I gave the album the devils\u2019 advocate treatment, it\u2019s time to view the album as a fan. This album can instantly transport me back to 10th grade. Despite the flaws of the album, I loved this release. Songs like \"What Will Become\", \"Damaged\" and \"Linchpin\" would be repeated many times that summer. I loved the simplistic, yet familiar sound Fear Factory offered on \"Digimortal\" and of course falling in the era that was dominated by Nu-Metal and Metalcore, I was naturally a fan of both. \n\nBurton\u2019s vocals, although not as harsh and violent as normal, are still powerful in their delivery. Their sound, while rooted more in the mold of Nu metal, they are executed well and still offer his trademark harsh and clean vocal tandem, albeit with less aggression. Although solos and in melodic guitar rhythms may not have always been one Fear Factory\u2019s priorities, they once again are absent from \u201cDigimortal\u201d That being said, generally Dino can offset the lack of rhythms and solos by producing memorable and hammering riffs to generate enough hooks and sustainability on most Fear Factory albums. This being Nu metal, he follows the template of the genre and instead of delivering crushing, groove laden riffs, we get a slimmer version of what we herd on \u201cDemanufacture\u201d and \u201cObsolete\u201d. Are they crushing? Nah. Groovy? Sure. Do they sound like Ne metal? Yeah, which is what I feel they were going for and in the scope of their targeted sound, they nailed it. In a good way mind you. The guitars may not inspire as much imagery as their previous work, but they more than carry both the metal sound, industrial components and Fear Factory\u2019s manta well enough. \n\nAs for Herrera\u2019s drums, think of them in the same light as the guitars. They are still clear and crisp with plenty of double bass kicks, but that\u2019s about as far as they go. They do not instill the same ferocity they normally bring to the table and instead play a slimmer version to compliment the Nu metal sound. Perhaps of all the instruments, the drumming would be the most comparable to their previous work as it takes command in the rhythm department for most of the album and drives the majority of the songs forward. Wolbers\u2019 bass may not play as nicely with Dino\u2019s guitars this time around, but they, much like the drums offer a distinctly notable sound on most of the album. It still carries the low sounding punch as before, but no longer blends with all the elements of the album and instead can be heard as more of an individual sound, which showcase\u2019s its ability, but also fails to harmonize into the cohesive Fear Factory sound. \n\nOf course, I can\u2019t forget to mention Rhys Fulber\u2019s work on programming and keys. His minor touches transform many of the songs in a big way. The industrial and technological sound heard throughout \u201cDigimortal\u201d still anchor the band to the industrial genre, which is most notably heard on songs such as \u201cWhat Will Become\u201d and \u201cNo One\u201d.\n\nFrom a diehard point of view, I'll always rate this album higher than it should be, but that's the beauty of one\u2019s opinion. Nostalgia aside, I was a fan of many Nu metal bands during their time, do Fear Factory\u2019s efforts in the Nu metal genre was always going to go over well with me, so I have no complaints. Sure, this is far from a masterpiece, but it\u2019s still a solid effort and most important of all, it\u2019s memorable. The digipak also offers a few excellent songs such as \"Strain vs. Resistance\", which I recommend getting if you're planning on giving this album a listen. \n\nHighlights: \"What Will Become\", \"Damaged\", \"No One,\" \"Linchpin\"\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nIt was the summer before entering high school and by that time, I had been jamming out to a stable mostly fixed of Pantera, Overkill, Metallica, but I was beginning to yearn for more metal. As fate would have it, my older brother would offer me a CD that he said he didn\u2019t enjoy, but knowing I loved metal as much as I did, thought I might. The album in question was Fear Factory\u2019s 1998 release, \u201cObsolete\u201d.\n\nI remember staring at the cover of the album, not knowing what to expect, but I was intrigued. I had never heard of the band before that point, so whatever I would hear on this album would have to serve as the focal point of my perception of the band. After my first listen, I was introduced to a new and invigorating sound that hooked me from the get go. Now, of course, at that time, the metal world was being turned upside down with the Nu metal movement beginning to take over the mainstream airwaves and while I was aware of such bands, I had yet to experience much of said craze. The same could be said for any type of industrial metal as well, so I would essentially be listening to an album with both Nu metal and industrial elements for the first time. \u201cObsolete\u201d would open my eyes to a world beyond the thrash and American groove metal that had constantly been blasting from my old boom box and introduce me to what would eventually become, my all-time favorite band. \n\nBeing 14 at the time, I was young, wet behind the ears and filled with teenage angst. Music had always (and still is) been one of my methods of dealing with the rigors of life and while the heading banging thrash assault of Metallica and Megadeeth combined with the pissed off shouts of Pantera were always at hand, \u201cObsolete\u201d offered something new and unique. I remember listening to Burton C. Bell\u2019s harsh vocals and couldn\u2019t help but lose myself in the rage and violence in his voice. His unique blend of hoarse yells and angry shouts convey so much emotion and conjure many internal images within the listener. However, the true curve ball I experienced while listening to \u201cObsolete\u201d would be the use of Bell\u2019s clean vocals. Up until that point, aside from a few ballads from the aforementioned bands or some glam metal that I still listened to, clean singing was simply not something that I sought out to hear in my metal. (Which is why I didn\u2019t get into power metal until late high-school) The chorus on \u201cShock\u201d at first caught me off guard. I was almost ready to pop the CD out as I thought anything that wasn\u2019t shouting, growling or guttural (I was really into Testaments\u2019 \u201cDemonic\u201d at the time.) than it simply wasn\u2019t metal enough. But, after hearing Bell\u2019s voice, I simply couldn\u2019t bring myself to stop the song. He had captivated my attention and had me at a disposition. After replaying it from the beginning, I immediately fell in love with the blend of his harsh and clean vocals. Bell\u2019s voice would continue to carry on throughout the album, offering me the outlet to transmit my teenage aggression, but also transport me to a more calming state of mind when his cleans kick in. To put it mildly, they had a euphoric effect on me and still hold a certain mesmerizing effect on me to this day.\n\nNow, at the time, I was rooted in the sound of guitar greats such as Kirk Hammett, Marty Friedman and Dime bag Darrel, so when I heard Dino\u2019s take on guitars, I\u2019ll admit, I was left feeling a little underwhelmed. Of course, this was not thrash metal, so to expect a shredding display of leads and solos would be foolhardy however, after multiple listens (and I listened to this album many, many times) the simplistic, yet catchy riffs would begin to resonate with the sound of the album as a whole and I began to appreciate them more. Their sound offers a robotic bite to the futuristic and cybernetic sound of the album, a sound that is both groovy and crushing, but blissfully simple in nature. Although I found myself initially disappointed that there were no solos to be heard, eventually, I began to realize that their absence did not affect my enjoyment of the album. The lack of solos may come off as a wasted opportunity to poor songwriting, but they simply are not necessary to create the foundation of sound for the album. The guitar\u2019s offer enough substance and power to root the songs to the industrial nature of the band, while creating plenty of memorable hooks along the way. \n\nThe drums on \u201cObsolete\u201d were like nothing I had heard before. Granted, I had the pleasure of listening to Lars Ulrich and Vinnine Paul for years, but Raymond Herrera\u2019s blistering assault of percussion was an entirely different beast altogether. The power and energy in the drums on \u201cObsolete\u201d are constantly in your face and force you pay them the attention they deserve however; they are not so overbearing that they steal any other instrument\u2019s thunder by any means. In fact, the drums aside from serving as one of the major rhythm generators of the album, create a sound that both sets it apart from the rest of the instruments, yet at the same time, serves as a beacon of harmony. This beacon allows the guitars, bass, vocals and special effects to come together as once cohesive sound. \n\n\u201cObsolete\u201d was the first album where Dino no longer had to man the bass duties, which would be handled by new comer; Christian Olde Wolbers. Unlike \u201cDemanufacture\u201d the bass on \u201cObsolete\u201d is felt throughout the album and is even put in the spotlight on the song \u201cEdgecrusher\u201d It delivers a thick and crunchy sound that reverberates with the mechanical sounding drums and futuristic sounding vocals. \n\nOnce again, Rhys Fulber adds his industrial touch, giving \u201cObsolete\u201d a very unique sound and vibe to many of the songs. I\u2019ve long heralded his abilities as an unofficial member of the band and it\u2019s easy to understand once you hear his work on obsolete. Listen to the opening of \"Shock\" to hear Rhys Fulber's work on programming. The sound is a simple guitar riffs that he put through various programming modules to create the awesome and unique sound.\n\nMusic aside and being a dumb kid at the time, it wasn\u2019t until on about my fifth listen that I finally decided to read the liner notes and discovered that \u201cObsolete\u201d was a concept album. It\u2019s a story about Edgecrusher, the protagonist, rising up and trying to destroying the machines that humanity has become far too dependent upon. The booklet contains part of the story, which is then intertwined with the actual songs and lyrics, which is a neat concept in both ideal and execution. Almost like a graphic novel only audible. Either way, it adds another awesome feature to this already wonderful album, one that was like a second, first listen once I discovered the story behind the music.\n\nAlthough \"Demanufacture\" may have been Fear Factory's most influential album of all time, \"Obsolete\" would become their most successful in terms of sales. Along with their digipak material, industrial rock legend, Gar Numan is featured on the band\u2019s remake of \u201cCars\u201d, which would propel the album to gold status. Speaking of the digipak material, it contains 5 additional tracks including the \u201cCars\u201d remake. Although the others are decent sounding sounds and fit the sound of \u201cObsolete\u201d they had nothing to do with the story and were ultimately left of the original track list (as far as I can tell, as they don\u2019t just sound like throwaway songs)\n\nThis was my first experience with Fear Factory when I was kid and it immediately spawned my affection for the band. I always recommend \"Demanufacture\" to any fan looking for metal suggestions, but almost always suggest this as a follow up due to its mainstream success and overall sound. It may not be a masterpiece in the eyes of others, but for me this album is pure gold Jerry!\n\nHighlights: \"Shock\" \"Hi-Tech Hate\" \"Descent\" \"Timelessness\" (Just listen to the whole album!)\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nShortly after the release of \"Soul of a New Machine\", Fear Factory dropped \"Fear is the Mindkiller\". This EP contained songs from their debut, but with a heavy techno sounding influence, which remixed and re-imaged the song\u2019s original sound. After 1995's \"Demanufacture\" the band would, once again, decide to take tracks from their latest release and remix them with yet another hefty dose of techno and electronic sounds to alter their genetic makeup. The result is the compilation album \"Remanufacture\" This compilation offers more than just a handful of songs \"Fear is the Mindkiller\" delivered as it is, for the most part the majority of the songs from \"Demanufacture\" just in a more techno light. (Hence the name \u201cRemanufacture\u201d)\n\nTo my ear the techno vibe is just as present as their 1993 EP, but the overall sound is a little more complete. Whereas \"Fear is the Mindkiller\" worked only with bits and pieces of the vocals from the original tracks, \"Remanufacture\" sees the remixed songs maintain a large majority of their original makeup, including the vocals and then adds the techno twist. Think of it as more of a techno infusion, rather than a remix. Electronic sounds and synthesizers are heavily used to transform the make up of the original songs, but keep much of their DNA intact. The difference between \"Fear is the Mind Killer\" and this release is the poopy sounding nature. \"Fear is the Mindkiller\" retained a very heavy metal resonance with techno vibes, \"Remanufactre\" has a more poppy, dance club sounding techno vibe to it. The majority of the songs have a repetitive nature of the sounds that become repetitious, which creates an almost mesmerizing effect. Thick and drawn out bass accompanies most of the songs, which only adds to the club sounding industrial sound. Once again, Ryhs Fulber works his programming and electronic magic to make this techno compilation possible, showing how vital his industrial touch is to the band\u2019s overall sound and identity. \n\nAs a whole, I enjoyed \"Remanufacture\" more than I did \"Fear is the Mindkiller\" largely due to the fact that, despite being techno remixes, the original source of each song is much more identifiable and recognizable. That being said, once again, unless you\u2019re a techno fan or a die heard Fear Factory fan, this album may not be your cup of tea.\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nIn 1992, Fear Factory released their debut album, \u201cSoul of a New Machine.\u201d The sound was a blend of raw, old school death metal with industrial elements added to create a powerful and mechanical sound. However, the sound \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d, albeit, effective and would be short lived as in the coming years, the band would tweak things to create the sound they ultimately thought fit their sound best. The result of said tweaks resulted in, \u201cDemanufacture\u201d and the brand of cyber-metal most associate when thinking about Fear Factory was born. Often considered Fear Factory\u2019s magnum opus, \u201cDemanufacture\u201d would pave the way for the sound that many bands would emulate down the road.\n\nWhen one thinks of industrial metal the likes of Godflesh, Ministry and even Killing Joke come to mind. Now, while \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d was, indeed, industrial in nature, it seemed to be missing the industrial punch to join such noteworthy list of contributors of the genre. The industrial sound in question came off more as complimentary component rather than a major feature. On \u201cDemanufactre\u201d however, the industrial sound was no longer merely additional elements spliced into the music, but rather an equal part of the formula that makes up the base of the album. As such, \u201cDemanufacture\u201d would better fit the mold of industrial metal.\n\nThe first change one will notice on \u201cDemanufacture\u201d would be Burton C. Bell\u2019s vocals. His vocals on \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d were raw and primordial and tended to sound more borrowed from other death metal acts at the time. However, since that time, he has altered the delivery of his heavier vocals, which are no less crushing and furious as they were before, but they now have their own unique sound. They are harsh and hoarse, carrying an air of violence that helps set the tone of the futuristic and industrial nature of the album. That being said, Bell has also honed his clean vocals as well on \u201cDemanufacture\u201d. On the debut, his cleans were clear and added an almost, robotic like quality to the sound. Now, they are far more crisp and well-rounded both in quality and quantity. They are featured more often in \u201cDemanufacture\u201d than on \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d and help create a deeper atmosphere for the majority of the album. The cleans also add a nice ebb and flow between the harsh vocals and pounding instrumentation, which would become a staple for Fear Factory from this album forward.\n\nOnce again, Dino\u2019s work on guitars flourish, as he creates numerous groovy and catchy leads that hook the listener from the get go. \u201cSelf- Bias Resistor\u201d starts out with a bouncy and memorable lead and then dives right into a chugging, groove pound riff that carries the song. Many of the songs follow this pattern of opening hooks and simple, but crushing riffs and while they may not be the most mind boggling in the greater scope of riffs, they provide plenty of substance and power to enhance the mood of each song. Now, there are no solos on this album, which only reiterates my claim from before that the guitars are not meant to be the focal point of the album, but rather a musical utility knife that can hook the listen, keep them entertained with simple and catchy leads and offer a nice transition into one of the many memorable choruses on this album. \n\nThe drums are, once again, manned by the machine, Raymond Herrera. His display of power shows even more so on \u201cDemanufacture\u201d as he hammers away from song to song, creating a lasting impact on the entire album. Drums have always been a driving force for Fear Factory and once you hear their effect on this album, you\u2019ll agree that their presence is irreplaceable. The drumming plays right along with the guitars for the most part, serving as a tandem rhythm section, creating section after section of memorable music. The bass, once again played by Dino, is not nearly as present as it was on \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d. Its absence is noticeable, but it really doesn\u2019t take away from the overall industrial sound, but that being said, it would have been nice to hear it more often.\n\nRhys Fulber\u2019s keyboards and mixing provide a spark to \u201cDemanufacture\u201d that was simply missing from \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d. Once he began working with the band on \u201cFear is the Mindkiller\u201d his electronic and techno oriented background added an entirely new level to the sound of Fear Factory. Once might even say that, his industrial/techno touch may have helped the band formulate the cyber metal sound Fear Factory have mastered for 25 years.\n\nRegardless of my fanboyism towards Fear Factory, \u201cDemanufacture\u201d is simply, a landmark album. It\u2019s importance to various metal acts is widely regarded and there is a reason why it pops up on numerous top xx albums of all time lists. Whether you love them or hate them, there\u2019s no denying the footprint \u201cDemanufacture\u201d left on the metal community. \n\nHighlights: \u201cDemanufacture\u201d \u201cSelf-Bias Resistor\u201d \u201cReplica\u201d \u201cZero Signal\u201d (I really don\u2019t\u2019 want to list the entire album here, but you get my point)\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nAfter the release of \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d, Fear Factory would release \u201cFear is the Mindkiller\u201d, an EP containing three songs from their debut album, but with a twist. The songs were essentially deconstructed, remixed, (\u201cSelf Immolation\u201d multiple times) and add multiple electronic sounds to create a techno version of their former selves. Having said that, the songs still contain their original atmosphere and familiar sound in that although each song is completely remixed, you are still able to clearly identify which song it is that has been altered. Much of the original lyrics have been shaved off to pave way for the techno atmosphere, but the vocals that do remain, still give the give off the industrial vibe of their original format. There is plenty of electronic sounds and synthesizers that add layer upon layer of sounds and effects that transform the original song into an interesting rendition of the original that creates new and strange atmospheres for each of the songs. The best way I can put it would be; this is not the techno you hear at the dance club, but rather a heavy metal sounding variety. It's still heavy and still resonates with heavy metal, not so much the poppy variety of techno.\n\nI would also like to note that, this was the introduction of Rhys Fulber's tenure with the band, whom in my opinion, would serve as an unofficial member of the band from this release onward. His skills on programming, sound effects and keyboards have added many layers of depth to the band\u2019s sound over the years. A very under the radar member of the band, but no less important. This is essentially his album (along with Bill Leeb) as the band didn't really have much to do with the remixes, other than provide the original content of course. \n\nI\u2019ve always recognized techno and industrial as the separate genres they are, but respect the fact that there is some overlap in their sound and backgrounds. That being said, I\u2019m not totally shocked that Fear Factory would put forth a heavily techno oriented remixes, but ultimately, the overall result was not exactly my cup of tea. I respect that the band explored their musical interests and also respect the fact that they kept this material on a separate release. I\u2019m also glad, to no offense to techno fans, that this would not carry over onto their next album and onward, although they would dabble in the techno genre in the near future, but that\u2019s another review. It\u2019s an interesting release nonetheless, but unless you\u2019re a diehard Fear Factory fan or a techno fan, this may not be up your alley.\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nFear Factory have been pumping out their brand of \u201ccyber metal\u201d for nearly 25 years, combining groovy heavy metal and industrial elements to create a futuristic atmosphere throughout their discography. However, before the band developed their trademark sound, they began in a much different light. Beginning their career under the name Ulceration in 1989, the band was set to release an album titled \u201cConcrete\u201d, but ultimately decided to scrap the album and undergo changes within the band. (more info on this can be read on the \u201cConcrete\u201d album that was released in 2005). Anyhow, out of the ashes of Ulceration, rose Fear Factory. After a couple of demos, the band would release their debut in 1992 \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d and the rest was history.\n\nOften dropped into the industrial category, it is true the Fear Factory dabble with a lot of technological, futuristic and sci-fi sounding material (which really began to show on their sophomore album, \u201cDemanufacture\u201d). But, before they would earn that label of \u201ccyber metal\u201d, the band played a very old school style of death metal, capturing the sound of the US death metal scene at the time with dark and guttural vocals, crushing guitars and pounding drums. The atmosphere on \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d dwells in the harsh realities of today\u2019s (as of 1992) world, while giving us a glimpse into the even darker and more disturbing realities of the future. However, unlike many of the copy and paste death metal acts around that time, Fear Factory were able to establish their own identity by incorporating the use of industrial elements to add a slight edge to their vision of death metal and thus, gained interest from various circles within the metal community. \n\nThe sound on \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d resonates with the likes of post-grind Napalm Death or Godflesh and even a little Entombed at times. There are many groovy, chugging sections as well as, short and disruptive blasts of guitars and drums. When you listen to this 17 song behemoth, you get the feeling of being trapped inside a dark, abandoned factory. (Ironically, the band did rehearse in a factory, which apparently leas to the choice of name, perhaps that was the inspiration for their sound as well?). The sound is dark and lonely and inspires a certain fear and anger while listening. The industrial/techno twinges that the band splices into the music offers a cybernetic edge to their sound, but the sound here is most definitely death metal. \n\nI\u2019ve always loved the sound of Burton C Bell\u2019s vocals. His cleans, for me, have always been simply stunning. Age and program assistance aside, he ranks as one of my favorite singers all time. Staying on the subject of clean vocals, one of the factors that made \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d unique was the use of Bell\u2019s clean tones and how they added a distinctive layer to the albums industrial approach. Clean vocals had been used in death metal before, but Fear Factory decided to make them a feature of the album, not just to simply to add variation to their sound, but to add depth to their overall theme. Yes, Bell has a nice clean voice, but there are times when his vocals give off the presence of being almost robotic (I hate to say industrial), or machine like, which both compliment and contrast with the harsh, vocals on the other side of his vocal spectrum. As for those harsh vocals, Bell would develop the right combination of anger and fury that would anchor his sound for the majority of his career after this album, but on \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d they are a mixed bag. At times, he carries a very low, monstrous tone that sounds almost like a loud whisper (\u201cMartyr\u201d), while at others, he lets loose with a mix of horrific growls and guttural barks. I\u2019m reminded of Mark Greenway\u2019s vocals from Napalm Death\u2019s, but Bell has his own distinct sound that adds an eerie echo to his vocals.\n\nDino Cazares\u2019 guitars have always been one of the highlights of the band, as he has the ability to create the futuristic tone that roots Fear Factory sound. On \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d the riffs here are thick, down-tuned and crunchy, which creates a distorted atmosphere. The leads haves plenty of groovy chugs to their makeup, but the industrial tweaks and hollow production makes many of the riffs sound almost like a machine in nature. The overall approach to the guitars on this album is not so much about creating catchy leads or shredding solos. Their purpose is to develop an industrial impact while helping depict the harsh truths within the vocals. There are some nice rhythms to be heard in the way of tempo changes and time shift, which coincide with Bells\u2019 vocals nicely and create a nice harmonizing effect.\n\nRaymond Herrera\u2019s drum work is an awesome display of power and ferocity, a trait that would follow him throughout his tenure with the band. I\u2019ve always said that his style is resembles that of a machine playing the drums and on \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d that mechanical style is on full display. The drums help create a powerful rhythm throughout the album, using a mixture of pounding beats, crashing cymbals and bass kicks, but they are not merely a mash up of loud percussion and noise. They, much as the crunchy guitars and Bell\u2019s vocals, offer yet another layer of the industrial sound, creating an almost machine like atmosphere that helps place you in that abandoned factory the sound the album is rooted in. The force of the drums always makes an impact on the songs, which would simply be lost without their touch.\n\nThe bass, which is credited to Andrew Shives that, other than a live performance, did not perform bass duties on the album. It was, in fact, Dino that played bass, or at least recorded the bass tacks in studio. Anyhow, the bass itself is even more thick and sludgy than man of the guitar chords, which at times gives the sound a very despondent sound, while also harmonizing quite nicely with the guitar leads.\n\nNow, putting my Fear Factory favoritism aside, I will say that this is far from a perfect album. There are moments when listening to the album straight through that the sound becomes, monotonous or for a lack of a better word, samey. The production has its flaws as well, as there are times when certain instruments tend to sound as if they are in the distance compared to the rest, but they are never ignored, nor completely washed out entirely. As I mentioned, Bell's vocals are not as well rounded as they would sound on later albums, they were no less effective for the brand of death metal on display here. \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d would mark the start of a very long and successful career for, Fear Factory and I would say this album is an important release for just for the death or industrial movement, but for the heavy metal movement in general. As a Fear Factory fanatic, I would rate this a 90+, but viewing it impartially, I will put aside my fanboyism and knock it a few points due to a few blemishes present. \n\nHighlights: \"Martyr\", \"Crisis\", \"Crash Test\", \"Self Immolation\"\n\nInto the Abyss of Oblivion\n",
        "\nMy expectations were fairly high following the awesome Mechanize and acceptable The Industrialist, especially considering Mike Heller making his album debut on drums. The initial release of Soul Hacker made me even eager to hear the album, even if it is a little bit of a rewrite of Edgecrusher sans the rap influences. All seemed well and encompassing all that I have enjoyed in listening to Fear Factory since 1997 on Carmageddon.\n\nThen the album lands. It starts off so well and has all the checkmarks ticked, with some cool classic Fear Factory going on for the first 5 songs. The production is top-notch as is expected, merging man and machine in perfect unison. Crushing kick drum and guitar sync and futuristic synthesizers. But then something happens. Something I had yet to experience on an Fear Factory album except for the last 3rd of the overly long Soul of a New Machine and the second half of The Industrialist. It starts to sound boring and forced.\n\nThe second half of the album is utterly forgettable and sounds like a cover band attempting the style of the real deal. There is no inspiration and it all starts to blend into irrelevance. And then begin the funnily re-recorded quotes from Blade Runner, completely out of place. And then comes to jarring attempt at a radio hit by the numbers: Regenerate. Am I listening to Happy Factory? Well, skip forward and the finale of the album continues with the poor Blade Runner references and bland songwriting.\n\nNow, I have the limited edition, which features one throwaway remix and... one of the best songs Fear Factory has done since 2002: Enhanced Reality. Man, that song is so simple but effective. It captures the futuristic nuclear winter vibe so well, that I have to wonder why it was left as a bonus track. Yes, it's not the classic Fear Factory, being a slow to medium pace power-ballad, but it works perfectly. It's like the big brother of the boring song that ends the actual album coming in to show how it is supposed to be done.\n\nOverall, I do enjoy the first half a lot, but the second half is what brings the score down quite a lot. I wish they'd done it a bit differently and written maybe one more song of Pisschrist / Obsolete ilk and replaced Regenerate with it, and then use Enhanced Reality as the album ender instead of Expiration Date. Then this one could have been right up there with Demanufacture and Obsolete.\n",
        "\nAfter bursting on to the scene with the poorly-conceived Soul of a New Machine, California's very own Fear Factory somewhat illogically decided that the grindcore/death metal/ear rape with samples wasn't for them (come to think of it, it was a perfectly logical decision, given the abortion that was the debut) and so set about a major renovation of their style in the three years that marked the gap between Soul... and this. A work many consider the band's magnum opus, FF changed from some hybrid of the aforementioned genres to a more industrial, groovy sound, whilst admittedly retaining some of the death metal elements, a primary example being guitarist Dino Cazares' machine gun riffing style.\n\nFirstly, I'll admit to not being a Fear Factory fan, merely listening to their work for one of two reasons: either, 1) trying in vain to hear what the critical praise is all about, or 2) because of their significance in the metal community, what with their pioneering usage of both clean vocals and growls within songs and being one of the first proper industrial metal bands, and a fairly successful one at that. \n\nSo we find ourselves here, with me listening to Demanufacture on repeat on long car journeys and the like, if only to find some strengths in it. And it's not like this album is all bad either; any metal fan can appreciate how much of a beast Raymond Herrera is and his drumwork on here excels from start to finish, blisteringly quick and propelling the songs forward with his groove. Equally, there are exactly four songs on this album worth listening to, and while 4 out of 11/12/15, depending on which version of the album you own, isn't the greatest ratio, the four songs in question are good. None of the bonus tracks do anything for the overall quality of the album, by the way, mine being a crappy song with a Spanish title, a crappy Agnostic Front cover, and a crappy remix of a crappy song from the original album. You get the picture.\n\nAnyway, the point is that the title track, \"Replica\", \"Dog Day Sunrise\" and particularly \"A Therapy for Pain\" are well worth your time. \"A Therapy for Pain\" is one of the few songs on here where FF really nailed the industrial vibe, this being a sprawling, near ten-minute Type O Negative-esque piece, maybe like the title track from Bloody Kisses only good. The main body of the song is driven by Burton C. Bell's powerful clean vocals and flows at mid-pace, and then is led off by a long semi-ambient industrial outro. \"Dog Day Sunrise\" is then the second strongest song here, catching the listener off-guard with its simplicity and calm nature, again dominated by Burton C. Bell's clean baritone. Unfortunately, the band seems to have missed the coincidence that the two best songs on here are those that feature exclusively clean singing.\n\nOn the flip side, we have the rest of the album, a confused, mechanical mess led by riffs with no variance and flat out yelling. All the other songs sound exactly the same due to this, and that sound is a lifeless, directionless rant against some machine-related concept. On the subject of concept, what is the concept here? This has been widely called a concept album, but does anyone actually know what the exact idea here is? Does anybody care? I doubt it, and for me it could be vaguely categorised as \"some shit about a conflict between man and machine\". I also highly doubt that Dino Cazares could even spell concept anyway. Finally, the production job doesn't really aid the album as a whole. I get that the band want to sound as robotic as possible, but maybe some of the songs may at least sound, I dunno, less like one long piece and, let's be honest, the album would be a lot less fucking boring if the songs sounded like they had some life in them.\n\nTo sum it all up, this can really be avoided quite easily. The good songs are worth their while, but don't justify going out and buying this album. What especially doesn't do favours for this album that upon comparing it with nu metal of the '90s, it is clear to see that this could have served as an inspiration or even catalyst for the explosion of nu metal in the late '90s. Still, could be worse... you could be listening to Soul of a New Machine.\n",
        "\nLike so many other bands at the time of the nu metal boom of the late 90s and early 2000s, Fear Factory switched their genre towards this new trendy sound in order to please record companies and get more exposure for themselves. They don't seem to be very pleased about this because Digimortal feels like much less effort was put into it than other Fear Factory albums. If there is a saving grace to this, it's that Digimortal still sounds like a Fear Factory album, a tepid and simple Fear Factory album, but at least one that holds onto their signature robotic identity.\n\nThere's such a dearth of energy on Digimortal that it feels like they treated it like a job rather than an actual artistic pursuit that they cared about. Everybody sounds like they're just half-assing their jobs. The guitar riffs on this album mostly just consist of mid-paced chugging without much in the way of variation. Keep in mind, Fear Factory already did chugging grooves on previous efforts, but they did them well, with a lot of energy, a lot of tempo shifts, and they change the notes around, forming jagged jackhammer-like riffs that strike hard. On Digimortal, these are mostly just jump-up bounce grooves that go at largely the same pace for the whole song. They lack the ferocity that made Demanufacture and Obsolete such heavyweights. They sound a little aggressive, but nowhere near as fired up as they used to be. The same can be said for Burton Bell's vocal performance. He shouts about a lot, but never pushes himself to the brink. It always sounds like he doesn't want to put his vocal cords at risk for this, and he's playing it safe. By contrast, his clean singing is probably as good as it's ever been. As for the other instruments, they fill the sound in well enough, but don't do much else. Digimortal just sounds like something the guys didn't care as much about, and it shows.\n\nThis feels like Fear Factory at its most basic. You've got your chunky, robotic riffs. You've got a guy alternating between barks and effect-drenched clean singing. And you've got a sci-fi setting with a lot of cool shit happening in it. But while this has all of that, it feels lacking. I already explained the instrumental deficiencies of this album, now let's look at composition. Most of the songs are the usual single-riff affairs with only the main riff and little else. The futuristic feeling of this album is much more subdued compared to earlier Fear Factory. Sure, on the clean-sung songs like \"Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies)\" Burton's voice adds a lot to it and gives it a very surreal and airy vibe that would fit the atmosphere of floating in blank white space. The rest of the album fails to hold much of an atmosphere and mostly relies on the weakened chugs. Yeah, a groove or two works for a bit, but doesn't last since most of these are basic verse/chorus songs with little to separate them. Few of the songs stand out, but only one of them is especially bad, that being \"Back the Fuck Up\". That song feels like a bad joke to me, and it only works as a comedy piece. I like Fear Factory and I like Cypress Hill, just never mix them. B Real sounds clownish and out of place while rapping and he screams \"BACK UP OFFA MEEEEEEEE\" like he got pushed off a building. The rest of the song is just hip-hop posturing with curse words and chugs. Aside from that, Digimortal is serviceable, but low-effort and basic.\n\nGoing nu metal and making an album just for the sake or money is a bad idea. Digimortal is what happens when you take otherwise passionate and talented metal performers and make them do the simplest take on their own sound. Digimortal feels like it was treated more as a job rather than a creative endeavor the band members were truly committed to. It isn't terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but there was so much more that could've been done. This is Fear Factory with the fire sucked out of them.\n",
        "\nBack in 1998. Fear Factory have already unleashed the cult \"Soul Of A New Machine\" and the solid \"Demanufacture\". How can FF progress from there? After an album as important as ''Demanufacture'', this album is almost a perfect exemple of a good sequel. So it was the most logical step but also a risky concept album based on the war between men and machines. \n\nThe artwork puts you directly into the atmosphere of this war against the machines. ''Obsolete'' starts with the splendid ''Shock''. A totally recognizable riff where Burton enters the scene by screaming \"Shock!\" Using his harsh voice to better bring out the coldness of the sound, \"Shock\" is incredibly full of violence and power. After such an opening, ''Edgecrusher's'' unparalleled groove plunges us into the story. Quickly you feel where the band is heading with this cortex of unleashed energy. The implacable violence of ''Smasher-Devourer'' with his monstrous chorus is counterbalanced by the clean vocals with a dazzling accuracy. It is 5 minutes of pure pleasure. The Cybernetics \"Securitron (Police State 2000)'' reminds us of ''Demanufacture'' with great riffs. Burton's voice is irremovable and yet unparalleled. \n\nWhile the first part of ''Obsolete'' made us think that the band had reached its climax, the second half is where FF pulls the trigger of a shotgun at close range. Behind, ''Freedom Or Fire'' there is an incongruous melody with Burton still screams at us out loud. Dino always comes out with the most effective rhythm sections that work perfectly with Raymond Herrera. This guy is a superman with supersonic play and precision. The title song is in the form of greetings addressed to those who survived this war and the conflict with the machines. \n\nHere is the ultimate tube for the radios: \"Man is obsolete, man is obsolete, erased, extinct!\" \nThis is a refrain that does not require translation. \n\nThe war has progressed well, the final assault can be put in place with ''Resurrection''. The song is focused almost totally on the clean vocals and the only song to reach the 6 minute mark. Never before had the band sounded so energetic. \n\n''Obsolete'' is a memorable concept album with cohesion and precision without fail, showing us that Fear Factory is at their peak and assuming themselves here. ''Obsolete'' is an album less frontal than ''Demanufacture'', but otherwise more successful. It should be noted that the digipack edition of ''Obsolete'' contains the cover of ''Cars'' by Gary Numan and also 4 unreleased songs of good quality.\n",
        "\nFear Factory's Demanufacture is still my most hated album that I've reviewed on the Metal Archives (a pretty good read if you enjoy musical defamation), but Fear Factory do have some worthwhile output to their name. Not exactly a death metal classic, not even really a pure death metal album, Soul of a New Machine was one of my first experiences of extreme music and remains heavy as shit today, especially compared to the band's other \"man against machine\" wank and the nu groove phase they went through. If it gives any idea of perspective, I bought this on the same day as a Red Hot Chili Peppers album and it's flanked in my collection by stuff like Machine Head and Disturbed, so my first impression all those years ago was mostly surprise. After that surprise had waned a little, I thought that Soul of a New Machine was a bit too noisy, overly percussive, repetitive, impenetrable, and really quite long, most of which still holds true for me nearly 10 years later.\n\nFirst off, Fear Factory were never death metal in the same way as Cannibal Corpse or Obituary or Death were: their brand of death metal relied on riffs and rhythms only, Dino Cazares probably never in his life going further down his guitar than the D string and that only because his fingers are too pudgy to play the small frets by the bridge. There aren't melodies or leads from any instrument, while the riffs are pummeling rather than thrashing or technical, having a definite industrial edge in some of the songs, as one can hear from the mechanized groove of 'Self Immolation'. Sometimes it's very fast and there are some nice semi-atmospheric descending scales that crop up a few times, but nothing particular that you might hang onto beyond the sheer brunt of the guitar. Added to that, the guitars are apparently synchronized with the bass drums, which was supposedly Fear Factory's big thing (I remember reading Chimaira's Mark Hunter giving special praise to this), though it gives less definition to the already dry guitar and the lower-pitched riffs just blend together as \"heaviness\" without being easily definable. However, listen to something like the opening of 'Flesh Hold' and you can see how some of the more varied riffs that twist and turn instead of stuttering on the low E really can latch in the mind and create both atmosphere and conditions for a good headbang.\n\nLet me go on to the \"impenetrable\" and \"really quite long\" comments now, because those are quite the issue when listening to the album as a whole. Although many of the songs have repeating sections, especially repeating slogans courtesy of Burton C. Bell (he really gets into the \"suffer bastard\" groove of 'Martyr'), they don't actually make it easy to distinguish where the song is heading or how it differs from the last song since there aren't many hooks barring a few clean-sung parts in four or five songs. It might be a benefit that the songs don't follow a verse-chorus-verse pattern, because it keeps them short and unpredictable, but it also means that I quickly forget what happened during their length as well. The problem is compounded by the increasingly shortening song lengths towards the tail of the album, where the material is even less catchy (vocal hooks mostly disappear at this stage) and the experience starts to drag interminably. It would have been advisable to cut at least four or five songs to increase the impact of individual moments, as well as for the band to more clearly define the direction of some of them, such as 'Suffer Age', which is set up with skill and intricacy and then descends almost into a grindcore song, disregarding the suspense of its long introduction for a gruff blast through two minutes of misdirected intensity.\n\nThe more memorable songs tend to be those where Burton C. Bell's vocals stand out more or Dino Cazares mixes up the riffs to provide a tastier meal. The first 8 songs aside from the sample-heavy 'Crisis' and directionless 'Crash Test' arguably fit the criteria best, while the latter half gets more intense in its death metal blasting, though not exactly better, 'Desecrate' or 'Big God/Raped Souls' proving the most ferocious. 'Scapegoat' has a great clean-sung chorus about judicial error, while 'Martyr' and 'Scumgrief' might get first place in the groove stakes. Other moments of interest include the dark ringing notes that open 'Escape Confusion' and the great throaty bass tone that appears by itself in some of the introductions and transitions. Ultimately, though, there's just too much material here and not enough to make it all stand out from song to song. The remixes found on Fear Is the Mindkiller would successfully transform some of this material into more atmospheric and industrial pieces, but Fear Factory would unfortunately find their horrible niche with the next full length, and all would be downhill from then on.\n",
        "\nSoul of a New Machine is distinct from the rest of Fear Factory's discography in that this album is death metal with only a slight industrial undercurrent. Soul of a New Machine plays more like an industrialized Napalm Death CD than the groovy, robotic sci-fi industrial metal works that would make up the rest of their career. Dino Cazares goes for riffs suited more to a traditional death metal audience and Burton Bell delivers most of his lines in a monstrous death growl that would make Barney Greenway proud. Soul of a New Machine is distinct as Fear Factory's odd debut as a death metal band.\n\nSoul of a New Machine shows Fear Factory attempting, at an early stage, to establish a unique identity in the climes of early 90s death metal. There are a large number of features to this release that other bands hadn't bothered with at this time. Plenty of the riffs have a crunch to them thanks to some being adapted from techno rhythms, with the band themselves citing Martyr as an example. Most of the album's guitar pieces are strong on impact and go for a sound that revolves around sledge grooves rather than the jackhammer riffing of later material, giving the guitars less of a sound like a robotic drill punching into concrete and more like some giant junkyard monstrosity that crushes other hunks of rusting metal into cubes. The bass has an imposing tone to its crushing licks, adding to the apocalyptic feel made by the guitars. Drum work on this album resembles machine parts beating away to enhance this even further. The vocals are roared forth with the force of a pissed off giant bear and add even more strength to the already beastly and muscular sound here. However, there are times where Bell takes the opposite vocal approach and sings in a faint, ethereal voice resembling a computer generated one. This was a novel thing in death metal, using clean vocals to get lines across in a more ethereal fashion to add to the atmosphere and deliver more feelings of despair and desolation. On top of all of this, Fear Factory writes some really savage songs with great riffs and plenty of crushing rage. Martyr, Arise Above Oppression, Big God/Raped Souls, Crisis, and Scapegoat are particularly imposing standout tracks. Even in early 90s death metal, Soul of a New Machine goes far in looking to distinguish itself.\n\nThis is a good album to start with when looking at Fear Factory's early catalog. Fans of death metal and grindcore will find a lot to get out of this with its punishing and apocalyptic soundscape. Soul of a New Machine attacks with all the speed, power, and impact of a terminator invasion. Aside from a few songs focusing on blasting beats and tremolos, as opposed to riffing and pounding, and the bizarre Natividad which is just audio from a junkyard crusher, almost all the songs deliver something of destructive substance. Soul of a New Machine is a great death metal release that shows Fear Factory at their most primitive and forceful.\n",
        "\nFear Factory almost fell apart before this album came about. With Digimortal not doing as well as expected and tensions flaring up between the band members, Dino Cazares would leave and Christian Olde Wolbers briefly departed before coming back shortly before Archetype became a thing. The stress was high and Fear Factory looked towards changing their sound back to something more familiar with Obsolete than the half-nu metal of Digimortal. The intensity was dialed back up and we were given Archetype.\n\nArchetype is a return to form in many ways. It goes only partly for grooves and more for accessible hooks and memorability. This album is front-heavy in the fact that every worthwhile song with any intensity is confined to the first six songs. Archetype, Slave Labor, and Act of God pack a lot of power and still sound brutal as ever with the guitar riffs, and vocal shouts and harmonies blending together the best on these for the most energy. However, once Bite The Hand That Bleeds comes on, this album ends up diving into filler territory really fast, it's good sounding filler, but still filler nonetheless and hardly memorable at all, which is unfortunate since memorable songs are something you expect from a Fear Factory album. A lot of the riffing on later songs is mostly chug based, and not even the lively kind of chugging that Fear Factory is known for. Archetype definitely suffered without Dino Cazares and by putting too much effort on Christian Olde Wolbers who is credited with both the guitar and bass writing, which would have tired the returning bassist out. He's still able to make the music on the later tracks work as background-style recordings and nothing on this album really offends the ears at all. You can find some good material on Archetype, but know that much of the best material is crowded up at the first half.\n\nBurton Bell gives one of his best singing performances on this album. The aerial sounding, computer-processed clean singing is at its strongest across songs like Archetype which rely on it for a sleek, futuristic feeling and strong choruses. He also syncs his vocals well up to the rhythm and his shouts still have a lot of impact, even on the filler tracks, giving life to the music that's already there. Bell's singing is a marked improvement from Digimortal and a definite plus on Archetype.\n\nIn many ways I view this as a middling Fear Factory album. It's okay with most of what it tries to do, and some of that is actually damn good with quite a bit to remember as it rocks you into the future. However, this album also lacks a lot of energy and effort. The guitars, while more energized than on Digimortal, are not as strong as earlier Fear Factory and the riff patterns aren't as creative. Losing Cazares and overworking Wolbers was not going to help these guys very much. Archetype is also as front-heavy as your average porno actress, only having enough in the back to make the album feel full with all of the hard hitters coming in first. If you're into Fear Factory, this album can provide a bit of fun for you and you may find some things to love, however this is still just another okay album for everybody else.\n",
        "\nAfter hitting a solid note with Demanufacture, Fear Factory set their sights on making a name for themselves in the metal climate of the late 1990s. This would give us Obsolete, a concept album that reads out much like the script to a sci-fi movie with tales of monstrous machines lording over humans in a dystopian future where robotics has become advanced enough to dominate all aspects of life. This being the late 90s, people were obsessing over computerization and the rapid advancement of the Internet, as well as the rise of alternative music. Fear Factory on Obsolete is very exemplary of the times and their concerns. They combine their signature metal sounds with a passionate spin on a possible and quickly approaching future. Obsolete is as strong as they come.\n\nObsolete sees Fear Factory going for a more catchy and epic sound. The start-stop chug riffing is structured in a way that pummels the listener like a supercharged jackhammer. Some of the heaviest and catchiest riffs and choruses are found on songs such as Shock, Edgecrusher, and Freedom Or Fire. Everything on Obsolete has enough force to blast skyscrapers into oblivion, from forceful growls and soaring clean vocals with a mechanical filter to give a robotic sound to Burton Bell's singing, to earthshaking mechanical riffs, to pummeling drums that put as much gust into the music as they can, often syncing with the guitars for an added robotic kick, Obsolete displays Fear Factory as truly proficient musicians. There are hints of alternative metal in this album with catchier songs and the use of turntables on Edgecrusher, which helps memorability and adds to the futuristic vibe if this release. There are also songs such as Descent and Resurrection which focus on a clean vocal style and catchier lines to give the album some variety and balance. These all help the more accessible and ambitious Fear Factory.\n\nThe album itself is structured off of a story the band made that strongly resembles an action movie. With the thunderous intro being handled by the first few songs detailing a robotocracy and the police state it upholds. The middle songs express themes of conflict, danger, and stress as the hero, Edgecrusher, sees the true extent of the horrors and threats he faces from his cybernetic overlords. This makes sense as the most menacing and melancholic tracks are in the middle. The ending is shown by the last two tracks which are the softest and most optimistic songs on the album, as if to show Edgecrusher in relief after his victory. The idea to structure this album like the movie Fear Factory always wanted to make, but never could, is a unique feature for an album, especially a non-progressive one.\n\nObsolete is Fear Factory's industrial push for the big time, an album that is at the same time accessible and ambitious. They go for a catchier, hook based style rooted in alternative metal and show off a knack for creating powerful and agile songwriting that shows off their robotic style. They also get creative, building a sci-fi world based in cyberpunk film and centering their album and its dynamics around their story. Obsolete is a strong album that any fan of industrial or groove metal can find a lot to enjoy about it.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing 3 abortions in a row, Fear Factory elected to throw in even more mallcore influence for their next album, Digimortal. The third and final concept album in the triptych of shite that also included Obsolete and Demanufacture, it was a good thing that the band went away after this one, because no more were our speakers being polluted with this nonsense. \n\nStraight away any prospective listener is 'treated' to a 2-note droning nu metal 'riff', and that sets the tone for the rest of the album, really. The whole thing is just full of these redundant and repetitive Roots-era Sepultura drones and mindless mechanical chugs played with a weak and processed guitar tone that drag their knuckles about without actually being entertaining in the way Pantera were. The songs don't flow, they feel stilted and broken and are hideously unmemorable due to their annoying stop-start anti-rhythms. The bass sounds nu metallish and drives the album too much, with vocals over bass verses being all too common on what should be a riff-driven album. The drums are boring as hell straight beats and stupid off-time stuff that gives the album a 'bounce', as well as combining the mechanical-sounding, overly precise and triggered performance of Demanufacture. \n\nThe vocals are horrendous, even by the standards of Burton Bell. His retarded and monotonous shouts sound even worse than they did before, having zero edge or power to them. His voice has basically taken a beating and hence now he sounds less like a metal vocalist and more like a mallcore vocalist, almost like Robbb Flynnn's gimpy yelling during their nu-metal phase. Even worse are his clean vocals, which combine angsty radio rock 'melodies' (read - tuneless whining) and absolutely no power behind them at all to give a revolting performance. They are there for the purposes of a catchy hook and hence radio play - but they are too damn distorted in order to sound 'industrial' and no one would want to sing along to crap like this.\n\nThe songs are all pretty much the same manufactured verse-hook-verse basic crap, where the verses are incoherent and unmemorable and the hook is weak and annoying. The songs are all pretty much the same length too, until the last few tracks. The only thing that separates one from the next is the prominence of the awful cleans and how broken the main 'riff' sounds. The album isn't industrial in any way, rather it throws those distorted cleans and the occasional 'mechanical' sound effect, as well as achieving a mechanical sound through the drum triggers, monotonous yells and juddering riffs to claim the 'industrial' tag. This whole album is a mess, from start to finish. A waste of studio time and a CD - completely worthless and shallow drivel.\n\nOh, and 'back the fuck up' with that rapping will you? A bunch of hacks like this lot should never try something as hard as mixing rap and rock/metal *well*.\n",
        "\nThe reunion of Bell and Cazares has been nothing but a thrill since the punishing \"Mechanize\" hit the shelves in 2010. That was a truly vicious record that heralded a triumphant return to form after the odd \"Transgression\". 2012's \"The Industrialist\" was something of a lap of honour, proving that they could still deliver the goods, albeit in a far less accessible way. However, 2015 brings with it good tidings of great joy in the Fear Factory camp. \"Genexus\" has arrived and, just like the 'new age of machines' the album (well, every FF album) describes, brings with it a new era for the industrial metal titans.\n\nIt's a good job Bell & co. make no effort to disguise their love of all things robotic and digital - because the atmosphere of \"Genexus\" is positively wrapped in cybernetics and circuitry. The two main factors that contribute to this electronic vibe are the expanded use of keyboards, and the rejuvenated guitar tone from Mr. Cazares. The former has become a more integral part of the compositions; carrying melodies as well as adding mechanical sound effects (\"Lockdown complete!\"). The latter feels like it has been put through a meat tenderizer - channelled in a more focused direction, whilst still retaining a beautifully buzzsaw-esque grind.\n\nWhilst the ethereal keyboards, machine-gun style drumming and bullet-precise riffs all hold their own throughout \"Genexus\", the vocals of the increasingly impressive Burton C Bell steal the show. His haunting clean singing is shrouded in effects, but for once I'm not complaining! After all, it only adds to the industrial atmosphere of the album. However, his vicious bark has neither softened nor waned in the past 25 years! For a man approaching 50, he is capable of sounding truly raw and brutal.\n\nThe album unfortunately is not structured well. Any one of these tracks could've been placed in any order (save for the ghostly \"Expiration Date\", but more on that later...). \"Autonomous Combat System\" doesn't quite pack as much of a punch as previous opening tracks such as \"Mechanize\" or \"What Will Become?\". However, following it up with the chin-wagging groove of \"Anodized\" was a stroke of genius. The most solid tracks can be found right at the heart of this album: \"Protomech\" brings back welcome speedy memories of \"Powershifter\". \"Soul-Hacker\" is an anthemic groove-a-thon that's guaranteed to start some pits! \"Dielectric\" brings back the more melodic stylings of the \"Digimortal\" era. But the jewel in the crown has to be the bombastic title-track. Such a powerful chorus combining Bell's enormous roar and a beautifully synthesized orchestra gets me pumped every time!\n\n\"Regenerate\" can almost be described as 'fodder'. Despite the awesome \"You can't kill me!!\" section, it only succeeds in contributing to the slightly sluggish latter half of the album. However, all qualms are forgotten once the listener is immersed in the spectral sound of closer \"Expiration Date\". The fuzzy, airy, almost celestial atmosphere absolutely envelopes you - bringing \"Genexus\" to a mysterious and melancholy close. It's bizarre, but by God it leaves you begging for more! \n\nSure, there are minor faults, but I really couldn't have asked for more from Burton and Dino. This is quickly becoming my favourite Fear Factory album; gnawing at the heels of 1995's classic \"Demanufacture\" - hell there are even some moments that echo melodies from this very release! Running out of ideas, maybe? Who cares?! I excitedly await the next journey into machinery, robotics and song-titles which combine human and mechanical characteristics! Proto-mech, Die-lectric, Gene-xus, Robo-bone, Cyb-elbow... The factory is still in business!\n\n\"No soul!\nYou'll never take my control!\nI dominate!\" \n",
        "\nSince their hallmark \u201890s albums Demanufacture and Obsolete, Fear Factory have stayed afloat in the ebbing music industry with varying results; the band\u2019s 2005 post-reunion album, Archetype, was met with critical praise, while its more experimental successor, Transgression, wasn\u2019t so favorably received. Fans rejoiced at the reunion of vocalist Burton C. Bell and exiled guitarist Dino Cazares for 2009\u2019s massive Mechanize, and the return to form felt so natural and celebratory that 2012\u2019s The Industrialist almost felt more like a victory lap than a genuine attempt to further the Fear Factory sound. In 2015, if you were to ask what territory the band still had left to explore, you probably wouldn\u2019t be alone in wondering. Fear Factory have answered with Genexus, quite possibly the best album they\u2019ve ever made.\n\nEvery single right step Fear Factory have ever taken is present on this album, and where past \u201cright steps\u201d may have felt underdeveloped, the songwriting and musicianship on Genexus take the record all the way home. Songs like \u201cAnodized,\u201d \u201cDielectric,\u201d and \u201cRegenerate\u201d retain the heavy/melodic duality that\u2019s served as a cornerstone of each past Fear Factory release, while capitalizing on Bell\u2019s vocal hooks and the lush electronics of longtime collaborator Rhys Fulber to push Genexus\u2019s cleaner moments in bold and memorable new directions. Cazares\u2019s riffs, as usual, are simply crushing; judging by the speed and precision of songs like the title track and sprawling opener \u201cAutonomous Combat System,\u201d the guy\u2019s picking forearm has to be as thick as a thigh by now. His guitar and bass performances are backed this time around by programmed percussion on select songs, as well as the recording debut of Mike Heller, the band\u2019s live drummer since the touring cycle for The Industrialist. Former Static-X bassist Tony Campos recently joined Fear Factory, but isn\u2019t featured on Genexus.\n\nWhile the instrumental performances are as impressive as anything from Demanufacture or Mechanize, Bell\u2019s vocals and lyrics really take the spotlight on Genexus. His lyrics are always at their best and most relevant when he nails that perfect intersection between sci-fi symbolism and observations on the human condition; we hear those qualities in some of the band\u2019s most powerful past numbers like \u201cResurrection\u201d and \u201cFinal Exit.\u201d But instead of being an album full of heavy music punctuated by occasional pensive introspection, Genexus is stacked front-to-back with the most significant lyrical substance Bell\u2019s ever generated in the span of one record. The most stunning example is \u201cExpiration Date,\u201d a haunting treatise on self-awareness in the face of death, set to one of the most beautiful songs the band\u2019s ever penned.\n\nFear Factory have outdone themselves. While no album is without its lesser tracks, the valleys on Genexus are surprisingly shallow, which is an impressive feat, given the soaring height of its peaks. As musicians are faced with maintaining passion in careers that began before part of their fanbase was even born, it\u2019s reassuring to see bands as mature as Fear Factory still producing some of their most crucial material. Genexus is excellent. The machine is still alive.\n\n(Review originally published on About Heavy Metal)\n",
        "\nI\u2019m going to go right ahead and say it: this is perhaps the most intelligent thing that Fear Factory ever released. I make no secret of my detestation for Demanufacture or my general shrugging in the direction of most of the debut, but Fear is the Mindkiller at least helped to push the envelope a bit, even if it is some kind of masochistic flogging at the hands of a drum machine, a synth, and a death metal bassist. It\u2019s not particularly death metal, it\u2019s certainly not techno, and it only has its teeth latched onto industrial\u2019s backside, but it has an undeniable surge of motion in its concrete grooves and a fair dash of menace in its dubby depths.\n\nHowever, the odd thing about Fear... is that it isn\u2019t really a Fear Factory release, since they are not responsible for the new songs, only for the originals. On that head, Rhys Fulber and the rest of the remixers deserve a big hand, even more so because their contributions have been downplayed over the years. Always users of electronics in their music, Fear Factory never managed to attach the kind of atmosphere to a song that the soundscapes in \u2018Self Immolation (Liquid Sky mix)\u2019 achieve, nor would the song sound nearly as good without them. The pounding, one-dimensional death metal - gravelly bass aside - rarely changes track or mood, whereas the new elements give the song a subtlety and uncertainty that is far more interesting than mere grooves.\n\nPicking a favourite song here is a little difficult, since the general rhythm and tone of the tracks are fairly uniform, plus Burton C. Bell\u2019s vocals are not exactly a focal point due to the trimming of material for the remixes. His harsh delivery is still better than he would ever achieve afterwards, while his cleans do lend \u2018Scapegoat\u2019 another dimension, but the inevitable repetition of an industrial-flavoured release render some parts unsavoury - witness the 2 straight minutes of \u201csuffer bastard\u201d in \u2018Martyr\u2019 for your example. In the end, it\u2019s the songs with a little more detail, like the aforementioned mix of \u2018Self Immolation\u2019, that slightly edge the rest, though they are best experienced as a whole, (mildly) atmospheric trip.\n",
        "\nIt actually surprises me that I like this so much, because this falls pretty far away from the proverbial basket most of my interests are found in. Yeah, this might happen to be a death metal album, but the obvious nu metal influences that would become more and more prominent with FF's later releases are already pretty visible here, though I grudgingly admit that they do this album more good than bad overall. There's an immense charm to the material found on Soul Of A New Machine because of it which turns it into a masterpiece where it had all the papers to be a trainwreck more than anything else. This album is pretty awkward, very clumsy and perhaps a bit compromised in its weirdness, but it still manages to hold up well against more obvious death metal masterpieces of its time as well as before and after its release. To call this a nu-death metal album is overstretching it, but the use of clean vocals, tendency to groove and pretty terrible lyrics definitely hint towards a more mainstream sound, of course further materialized on later albums.\n\nYes, you read it right though, Soul Of A New Machine is a death metal album, and a very unique one at that. It has the nu metal influences, but there's also the obvious industrial elements that characterize the band's sound, but what's arguably even more unique is that there's actually a healthy dose of early grindcore found here as well. Burton C. Bell does a nice job at imitating Napalm Death's vocals with his growls and some tracks definitely use some of the foundations that they laid a few years prior to this. I have to say, the weird combination of both brutality and melody (including the clean vocals) actually works pretty fucking fantastic. Sure, this album is unintentionally somewhat pretentious and awkward as a result, but again, it's that charm that keeps the majority of the album very enjoyable. It's wholly confused at times and doesn't really seem to know whether it should go flat-out brutal on us or instead treat us with a clean vocal passage, but most of the time the result is great no matter what.\n\nStill, at times it's inexcusable. Bell's growls aren't very exciting, they do their job at being 'death metal', but along with some questionable clean vocal sections and crappy lyrics there's definitely something to brag about. Like I said, the lyrics kinda suck, and his oftentimes simply mediocre vocals definitely hold the album back. The best examples are the opening 'speech' to \"Big God / Raped Souls\" (that's him, right?) and the inane chorus to \"Self-Immolation\" which -I am not kidding- has \"Self-Immolation, Crying Out!\" being repeated time and time again, with no alterations whatsoever. This becomes pretty fucking annoying at times, but luckily it isn't a very long song and apart from the crappy chorus it's actually a pretty good one nonetheless. It's clear that these lyrics are already full-fledged nu metal and the vocals also hint towards the genre, but that's basically it for the more obvious flaws.\n\nI can only praise this album for its material, it takes a whopping 17 tracks covering 55 minutes to stop emitting sound, but I find that not a single second of it actively bores me even the slightest. The industrial elements used on this album definitely set it apart from more traditional death metal records at the time, because what really sounds like this? Fear Factory looked at death metal, and basically thought about how they could expand the genre, and I'm pretty damn positive that they did a fine job at achieving just that. Sure, clean vocals are sometimes featured in death metal, but this much? It's definitely a big risk to take, but Bell is generally a very good clean singer, he just tends to use it the wrong way from time to time. There are numerous clean vocal breaks on this album, but apart from a few they're all a joy to hear on an album that succesfully mixes so many genres together into 1 glorious piece of experimental glory.\n\nTechnically, this album gets the job done. It's not anything special as it's somewhat basic for death metal riffing standards, but Fear Factory made full advantage of their supreme knowledge of how to make simplicity work by creating what is hands down one of the catchiest death metal albums ever made. It's obvious that this doesn't need stark technicality or complexity to be good, as this isn't really a riff-dependant album, the fact that the riffs are pretty catchy is a nice bonus, but I feel the complete package of a band mashing as much as they could into basically every song here is largely responsible for what makes this such a joy to hear. Soul Of A New Machine is full of electronic effects, sound samples and unusual stuff for a death metal release that reveal this album's insanely interesting experimental nature. This is a work of immense depth, songs are somewhat clumsy but it's obvious that a lot of thought and care went into making each song awesome in its own right. The instrumentation is mixed, as I said the typical early 90's guitar doesn't have much to prove in terms of technicality, but the catchiness we get in return more than makes up for it, couple with that a genuinely great bass sound and an impressive drum peformance and you have something that simply works.\n\nThis is a really great album and, while definitely on the long side, proves to be one of the most recognizable and memorable outings of the 90's. I urge basically everyone to give this a spin, this album is just well-rounded and doesn't really lack anything it shouldn't lack. The mediocre lyrics can be blamed on the nu metal aesthetics already present here, but it's largely overshadowed by the immensely good chunk of material that this release contains. It's clumsy, awkward and probably not very self-aware, but it doesn't hold the album back more than strictly necessary. This is one of the most diverse death metal records ever, succesfully combining melody with brutality, and it sounds awesome. This is Soul Of A New Machine, experimentation done oh so right.\n",
        "\nI understand why this album had to be made. But, my god, I can't understand why we had to listen to it. I counted all the riffs in this album...and there's one at the start of the title track. Really, the band keep playing it for 45 minutes and it never gets interesting. Or, if I'm being kind, there's the one that stutters and the one that doesn't, which is slightly better. I don't want to write a long intro, so I will summarise by saying that this ranks among my least appealing metal albums. And why is Demanufacture so shit? Let's investigate.\n\nThe basic elements aren't too bad. Dino Cazares has a decent nearly-death metal guitar tone with a very throaty bass behind it and Raymond Herrera is a good drummer. The instrumentalists are given a strong, if somewhat dry, production. What they do with it is utterly worthless. The drums follow the guitars on every riff, bar none. I think that was Fear Factory's unique innovation, but I don't see the point, since it just turns everything into a super-percussive mess, without distinctive riffs or atmosphere. Of course, there are no solos. Yes, it sounds mechanical, but so does the clock in my bedroom and I didn't have to buy Demanufacture to hear that.\n\nThe worst part is that Burton C. Bell's vocals add approximately nothing to the equation. His shout is flat and expressionless. It just sounds like someone shouting, which again I don't have to purchase - my dad does that. The cleans are a relief because they give a little bit of variation, though they aren't good in any sense, just a break from the monotony. The keyboards are actually very welcome, giving some nuance and variety to what is otherwise a few skilful toddlers breaking their toys. All this may sound unkind, but it's the most awfully repetitive album I've ever heard.\n\nPicking out songs is tough. 'New Breed' is angrier than the others, so is a more intense blast, while 'H-K (Hunter Killer)' maybe makes it up to one and a half riffs. Then 'Dog Day Sunrise' sounds alright because it's much easier on the ears and doesn't employ the same bash and bash and BASH and BASH percussive formula. It's the same with 'A Therapy for Pain', but that isn't particularly a song either, more like a dream that Peter Steele might have had when he was 15 (actually, that would probably have been a really cool dream, but basically it's a shit Type O Negative song). The other songs, taken on their own, might be okay, but together on an album blend into one big mess of drums and groove/industrial guitar. Having an average length of 5 minutes really doesn't help either, when the actual content is about 5 minutes for the entire album.\n\nMy advice: hit your head against a metal door for an hour to listen to the remix.\n",
        "\nThe first Fear Factory album stands in stark contrast to the rest of its catalog. Mostly sounding as a groovier inclined version of Napalm Death circa \u201cUtopia Banished\u201d and \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d, it is catchy and aggressive in equal measure. The dichotomy between extremity and mainstream accessibility is already present here. Yet on \u201cSoul Of A New Machine\u201d the rough edges are still present making it very different from the band\u2019s later groove metal material. That Fear Factory was a one-trick pony is abundantly clear from the onset, although arguably this record is one of its more diverse offerings. That it is often ignored for its more readily accessible material only makes it more interesting, even though the record is horribly paced, and confused sounding. \n\nFear Factory was founded in 1989 in Los Angeles, California by Mexican transplant Dino Cazares (rhythm guitars) and noted video game fanatic Raymond Herrera (drums). The early version of the band was rounded by a trio of forgotten bassists, of which only Andrew Shives made it onto the production credits of the band\u2019s debut, and frontman Burton C. Bell. Initially the band went under the more death metal sounding moniker Ulceration before switching to Fear the Factory, and not much later the abbreviated (and more memorable) Fear Factory in 1990. After an unsatisfactory demo recording session at Blackie Lawless\u2019 Fort Apache Studio in Hollywood, California with producer Ross Robinson, the band relocated to a different studio with Colin Richardson overseeing the mix. Instrumental in getting the band its new record deal after Ross Robinson won the court case against his former clients was Brazilian national Max Cavalera (from South American genre hopefuls Sepultura), who brokered a contract for the band with Roadrunner Records, a label imprint that at this point was fully supporting the international death metal movement, only to acrimoniously abandon it a decade later. \n\nEven at its heaviest Fear Factory was a decidedly hook oriented outfit, which wasn\u2019t uncommon for the style itself but lend itself for cross-genre appeal. It seems that for every heavy or blast section there\u2019s a sugary clean section, or a stomping groove part. The duality between extremity and accessibility is what reduces the middle section of the record to a test of patience. The first three songs (and \u2018Scumgrief\u2019 a bit later) are exceptional in the way they combine clean vocal hooks with bludgeoning death metal. Even though Fear Factory was obviously commercially inclined with its thick grooves and (sometimes contrived) clean-harsh vocal dichotomy the band\u2019s sound is only partially formed on its debut. The repetitive riffing, and mechanical rhythm sections are in place, but Dino Cazares\u2019 staccato, rhythm-only playing is still shrouded in early UK/US death metal stylings and techniques. The album is notably bass-heavier than anything that would succeed it. The bass guitar has that thick, murky sound one associates with Napalm Death circa \u201cUtopia Banished\u201d and \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d. The bass guitar itself is also integral to many of the songs as in various spots it gets a solo break, or two.\n\nIt is not until \u2018Scumgrief\u2019, and the instrumental percussion track \u2018Natividad\u2019, which was dedicated to the memory of Cazares\u2019 mother, that the record picks up pace again. \u201cSoul Of A New Machine\u201d continues with a number of meddling, directionless and confused sounding cuts until at long last arriving at the final third of the tracklist. The last third of the album is the most conventionally death metal sounding, and the least adventurous in terms of composition. Deriving most of its sound from Napalm Death these cuts operate at a breakneck pace, and spent little time on nuance and subtlety. It is the kind of consistency that the rest of the record lacks. Had the entire middle half been left on the studio floor, and recombined with the earlier mentioned four signature tracks (along with the instrumental interlude) of the record\u2019s first third, it would have been far more concise and memorable in the long run. Now the album is just long with no payoff.\n\nThe album is supposedly a loosely conceptual record about man\u2019s creation of a machine that either could be technological, or governmental. The lyrics haven\u2019t yet zoned in on and fleshed out the man vs machine concept that would come to define the band\u2019s prime era material, although the rough outlines are already accounted for. There are variety of subjects tackled on this album including personal relationships (\u2018Martyr\u2019, \u2018Leechmaster\u2019, \u2018Scumgrief\u2019), introspection (\u2018W.O.E.\u2019), animal lab testings (\u2018Crash Test\u2019), socio-political dismay (\u2018Arise Above Oppression\u2019, \u2018Escape Confusion\u2019, \u2018Manipulation\u2019), global conflict (\u2018Crisis\u2019), faults of the criminal justice system (\u2018Scapegoat\u2019, \u2018Flesh Hold\u2019) and religious hypocrisy (\u2018Lifeblind\u2019, \u2018Big God/Raped Souls\u2019, \u2018Self Immolation\u2019). The industrial component of the band\u2019s sound comes mostly from the mechanical rhythms, and the usage of samples (including \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d, \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d) along with the sparse use of studio effects. Much of it reads like a work-in-progress.\n\nBurton C. Bell\u2019s hoarse grunt is a commendable Mark \u2018Barney\u2019 Greenway approximation, but his clean vocals are terrible at best \u2013 even though the combination of both was novel at the time, and would later be famously adopted by Robb Flynn (Machine Head) and the metalcore scene at large. Being the last of its kind Bell would trade in his grunt for a harsh shout, and he would increasingly put more focus on the clean vocal hooks that first surfaced here. In totality this is Fear Factory\u2019s most aggressive, and heavy release \u2013 and it is the culmination of its first phase after the aborted \u201cConcrete\u201d sessions of which the majority of material (albeit rewritten) is lifted. The core trio is in its designated place, yet the bass guitarist slot had yet to be permanently manned. Due to this rhythm guitarist Dino Cazares played bass guitar during the recording, despite Andrew Shives being credited as bass guitarist in the production notes. Andrew Shives was a glorified live member at best, as he doesn\u2019t appear to have had any significant input in the writing of any of these songs, all of which were written by the Cazares-Herrera axis. \n\n\u201cSoul Of A New Machine\u201d was recorded at Grand Master in Hollywood, California with producer Colin Richardson manning the console. It is a rather typical production for the time with thick, crunchy guitars, murky reverb-laden bass guitar tones and an earthy drum production that squarely focuses on bottom-end heaviness. For its debut the band worked with graphic designer Karl Kotas. \u201cSoul Of A New Machine\u201d is dedicated to the memory of Dino Cazares\u2019 parents. In totality \u201cSoul Of A New Machine\u201d is a worthwhile effort for a young band still finding its sound and identity. It certainly isn\u2019t the best of its kind (Napalm Death just did this sound earlier, and well, better), and it is a pity the band didn\u2019t explore this direction on future output. Given some trimming, and more focus Fear Factory could have been an interesting death metal band. Afterwards the band would opt for a direction change while keeping its base elements in place. At least Fear Factory would be able to write its signature album, and a worthy follow-up. Its career path afterward is somewhat bumpy due to industry pressure, interpersonal conflicts and the want to recapture a thing that wasn\u2019t exactly stellar to begin with.\n\nReview originally written for Least Worst Option - www.leastworstoption.com\n",
        "\nThis is probably the most intriguing album Fear Factory ever made. Not the best, but certainly interesting. The band had previously broken up, then reformed without Dino-the main songwriter, with Christian switching from bass to guitar and presumably writing duties. A big set of changes for a band that constantly evolved their sound...and went too far on the follow up to this album with \"Transgression\". That album not only strayed too far from FFs core sound, but also just wasn't that good in general. \"Archetype\", however, is a solid album that dabbles across the whole spectrum of FFs previous albums.\n\nConsidering the potentially divisive nature of this album and the changes mentioned above, there are no particularly negative reviews of this album on this website and I don't know any Fear Factory fans that dislike it. Dino has often claimed that the band at this time simply copied his old ideas and even rehashed his previous riffs, but I think that is just bitterness. This is a pleasantly surprising album which makes \"Transgression\" all the more disappointing, as \"Archetype\" suggested the band could continue strongly without Dino.\n\nOnto the album itself. \"Slave Labor\" kicks things off in style. One of FFs best ever songs. Crunching riffs, blistering kick drums, huge sounding bass guitar and Burton delivering his vocals with utter conviction. Same goes for track 2 and first single \"Cyberwaste\". Raymond's drumming is unreal on this one. What a comeback song too, catchy yet heavy as fuck and very intense. Later on the album \"Bonescraper\" has a similar aggression reminiscent of earlier FF. These are the heaviest tracks on the album. \n\nThe majority of the rest of this album is somewhere between \"Obsolete\" and \"Digimortal\": Heavy songs but with plenty of clean vocals and catchy choruses, with less of the atmosphere found on \"Demanufacture\". This isn't a bad thing by any means, but people expecting \"Demanufacture Part 2\" will be disappointed. My general opinion on any band is that they should try to gradually evolve a core sound instead of repeating themselves constantly, something which Fear Factory have certainly managed even if the end result isn't always great.\n\nThere are very few tracks that I have issues with. \"Act of God\" is filler and the last track \"Ascension\" is the standard ambient outro they've done before, except this one is particularly boring. Also, it would be the end of the album if it wasn't for the utterly worthless Nirvana cover tacked onto the end. The original is shit, all FF do is 'heavy' it up. Even though this album has no overall concept like previous albums, this track still doesn't fit. It isn't in the style of the rest of the songs, it isn't good and it seems like a pointless afterthought. Seriously, if it was a particularly famous Nirvana song I could maybe understand the record label trying to milk it (like the \"Cars\" cover) but no, this is a waste of CD space.\n\nThose 3 tracks aside, I can understand why some fans may dislike the two 'ballads'. Personally I have no real issue with \"Bite the Hand that Bleeds\" or \"Human Shields\" but they are slower and not typical FF tracks. As for the rest of the songs that I haven't mentioned, as I said above could easily fit on the two previous albums. \n\nPerformance wise, Burton mixes harsh shouts and clean vocals as usual and his performance is top quality. Lyrically, there is no concept and as such the songs have more varied lyrical topics. Self immolation, internet tough guys, certain ex members, politics, corporations etc all get touched upon and of course technology gets a few mentions. So if you're into FF for man vs machine concepts only, this isn't the place to look. Again, I have no problems with the wider range of lyrics here.\n\nMusically this is standard FF and to be honest you barely notice the absence of Dino. Christian does a good job of carrying on his style which suggests the previous claims to his growing influence on their sound before the split are probably true. The riffs are generally solid and typical FF. He played all the guitar and bass here and I have to especially note the much more obvious bass sound. He has an amazing tone and for once it is allowed to shine. Big basslines ride through \"Slave Labor\" and \"Default Judgement\", nothing spectacular but solid lines with an immense, deep tone. Raymond does the usual business on drums, perhaps lacking variety with his hands but those incredible kick drums are his typical dominant, crushing and mechanical style. So top marks for musicianship and production sound here.\n\nTo summarize, this isn't \"Demanufacture Part 2\". It isn't really like any other Fear Factory album, instead a generally excellent mix of the previous albums with perhaps a few more more modern twists. Certainly a diverse album, likely to please open minded fans simple because the song writing is so strong. Widely regarded as a return to form/good comeback album, I'd have to agree with that.\n\nRecommended: Slave Labor, Cyberwaste, Corporate Cloning, Default Judgement.\n",
        "\nFear Factory have always played radio rock disguised as \"metal\" throughout the entirety of their history as a band, but with this album they seem to have fooled some people into thinking they had a \"death metal past\". In reality, this is the same product with a different skin. The same commercial soul rests in this machine and was all that Roadrunner Records needed to test the waters before dropping their entire death metal roster to make way for Coal Chamber, Slipknot, and Nickelback (except Deicide since they still made money). While the surface traits of this album seem to have been borrowed from the Napalm Death and Godflesh (maybe even Pitch Shifter) recordings of the time (to the point of not being signed by Earache for being too derivative of their roster), what we really have is an aesthetic mash-up that functions as yet another prototype for Nu-Meddle that deserves it's place next to Pantera, Chaos AD, and Biohazard in the pantheon of recordings that ruined music for future generations.\n\nThe bands aesthetic seems to be juxtaposing Napalm Death derived power-chord rhythm riffs and vocals against Godflesh inspired discordant melodic passages and clean vocals. Thankfully, the grunt/growl style of vocals do a pretty good job at imitating Barney Greenway and the cleans are kept to a Justin Broadrick imitation which isn't annoying unlike the later faux-operatic U2 styled singing vocalist Burton Bell would later utilize on their more obviously Nu-Meddle recordings. The lyrics tackle on interesting subject matter (judicial system, animal lab testing) but are written in an angsty \"keeping it real\" simplistic manner that have more in line with their Korn-y descendants. At worst, lyrics become \"personal\" or a parody of generic death metal lyrics (Manipulation and Desecrate, respectively).\n\nThe main thing this band did that would inspire legions of mall musicians is varying up rhythm picking patterns of 2 notes or chords against kick drums into a mechanical groove for a \"machine like\" feeling. Some tag this 'industrial' because of this feel but, despite ornamentation through samples on select tracks, the compositions feel more akin to the alternative rock of the day that is analogous to the dreadlocks-wave that was just beginning (Rage Against the Machine).\n\nSongs are organized into a standard verse-chorus format, where verses are filled with grooved out power chords or mechanically patterned rhythmic chugging of notes, and choruses are \"melodic\" affairs with a repeating meme (if not song title) that occasionally are accompanied by melodic sung vocals. It gets boring very fast, especially if you're already accustomed to real death metal since this has more in common with the Nirvana album of the time on a structural and communicative level with it's radio formatted display of suburban misery (where angsty loud choruses are verses here instead, choruses the whining drone). In other words, a corporate sham right out the gate. It comes off as being aesthetically unpleasant with it's intent to sound aesthetically pleasant by making the \"brutal\" sections seem \"warm and fuzzy\" when thrown next to those \"safe and reassuring\" choruses.\n\nTracks like Scapegoat and Crisis place an emphasis on vocals and have shuffling rhythms akin to rap music (sure enough, the riff to 'Scapegoat' was stolen by Korn for use in their single \"Blind\") and are representative of Fear Factory's unfortunate contribution to the music scene at large. Some variation to the formula occurs on select tracks like 'Desecrate' which sounds like a mash-up between Deicide and Napalm Death, one of few songs with melody embedded into a blasting angry verse riff but soon devolves into generic mosh death during the bridge that's not unlike Benediction. 'Flesh Hold' seems to ripoff Napalm Death's Utopia Banished throughout, being nothing but aggressive grinding death riffs but having melody incorporated during a couple of those riffs. This album's flow is also inconsistent, with the B-Side (or all songs starting from Big God/Raped Souls) having afterthought experiments such as Self-Immolation (the most \"industrial\" song here, utilizing a dance rhythm throughout) and Arise Above Oppression (a Napalm Death short blast track), where one idea is used and exhausted before the track ends, seemingly cobbled together at the last moment to fill time on this album.\n\nThat's the album in a nutshell - angry and hackneyed groove patterns and variations of similar rhythms patterns drone on before a melodic chorus and back again with any variations to the formula coming through incomplete failed experiments, never mind this band's attempt to make death metal \"nice\" being a failure of an idea to begin with. It is machine like with it's dishonesty, assembled through the parts of other bands with a focus group like flow chart mentality.\n\nIt would be wiser to listen to Streetcleaner and early 90's Napalm Death than this (the last track on Napalm Death's Utopia Banished is more effective at bringing a sense of \"contemplation\" to blasting frustration aimed at society than the entirety of this album). It should be no surprise the route this band would take since this album just seemed to be a space for the band to stretch out into more commercial pastures by using what was popular and trendy at the time as a spring board. Vapid. Purchase some Godflesh and Napalm Death instead.\n",
        "\nFear Factory, along with Godflesh and Ministry, is a pioneering industrial metal band that I can\u2019t fucking stand. Their vast influence on later extreme metal is so often overstated considering how grating and repetitive they tend to be: their definitive album Demanufacture not surviving one playthrough in my collection despite it being acquired for pocket change. However their debut still managed to pique my interest, as allegedly Soul of a New Machine confined itself to the harsh realm of death metal without the mechanical attributes of industrial music and unnecessary melodic passages that so taint their later material. Unfortunately, though the band were indeed performing death metal at their earliest stage, their fascination with the static, unpleasant, non-musical industrial movement is pronounced, if not fully implemented, and the album suffers appropriately.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that Soul of a New Machine successfully achieves is a wholly unique atmosphere for its era, as it\u2019s hard to imagine anything else this minimalistic and degenerative about in \u201992. Its cold, processed sound and repetitive riff structures punctuated by sampled film clips was surely alien for its time, with only the Napalm Death material of the time being remotely similar in nature. Still, its unique nature is not necessarily appealing, particularly to those fascinated by the increasing complexity brought to death metal, both American and Swedish. Fear Factory\u2019s regressive approach is stifling to the imagination and it\u2019s no wonder that that their post- \u201cIndustrial Revolution\u201d works are compared to nu-metal. One can only assume that groups like Drowning Pool and Disturbed were impressed by Fear Factory\u2019s plain yet crushing rhythms and tonal ambiguity, though those others clearly ignored the more extreme portions of Fear Factory\u2019s sound, as you won\u2019t hear any tremolo blasting in any of the derivative works. \n\nThat Fear Factory sound roughly alternates between stuttered, yet simple Meshuggah-like patterns and unexpected explosions of Napalm Death-like intensity. The minimal rhythmic approach is supported by Burton C. Bell\u2019s weakened Barney Greenway impression, which nonetheless becomes more appropriate as the album plays on. The tonal ambiguity I find so jarring is that, despite the group\u2019s supposed dedication to providing the most oppressive, dystopian atmosphere possible (in approximation of early Godflesh, which despite my dislike, I can at least admit they achieve what they\u2019d set out to do and probably care little about my opinion on their work), the odd melodic bits glare through the murk and undermine the general dreariness of the record. I had figured that these parts hadn\u2019t been implemented until later in their career (Demanufacture onward), but Burton\u2019s tuneful, if a bit monotonous, clean singing feels out of place on this otherwise singularly discordant piece. Additionally, the subject matter leans toward the personal and juvenile, whereas a more abstract and speculative approach might have been more cogent and appropriate given the musical accompaniment.\n\nThere is a forward-thinking ebb and flow to the way these tracks are constructed, with numerous thoughtful riff progressions and a strong, varied approach to percussion that stands out in the wake of future records, where said percussion devolves to match Dino Cazares' uninspiring guitarwork. But repetition is still the fatal flaw, particularly in a track like \u201cMartyr,\u201d which staggers over the same passages over and over again (particularly in the chorus, a mistake to be repeated throughout the album), not to mention has these queer growl-whispering passages from Bell. There\u2019s also an unusual arrangement of the many, many songs on the record, with its slowest tracks occupying the opening slots while the most consistently death metal-ish tracks show up in its final third or so. It is the hybridized middle tracks that tend to be the most memorable, such as \u201cArise Above Oppression.\u201d\n\nCall me a traditionalist, but I\u2019d probably have preferred a more conventional death metal record, devoid of the experimentation and with a more complicated rhythm section. But as you may not be me (in fact, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not), this record\u2019s particular atmosphere may provide enough appeal to justify its shortcomings. There is far more depth here than on their future recordings, none of which I can recommend. Its unique qualities may grow on you even should it provide an unimpressive initial listen, though as of this writing, I cannot yet consider myself a fan.\n",
        "\nFear Factory have really struck a chord as far as building an album that was meant to capture you're attention. Demanufacture is a jarring, destructive, mechanical hellride that will pummel you into the dirt without so much as a second listen. It's a new, original take on the Groove metal sound by adding heavy elements of electronica and industrial music to create this very mechanical, cybernetic sound. Back when this came out there was very little else like it, yet many bands in a similar style. It take the crushing groove riff techniques of bands like Machine Head and Pantera and blends it with the cybernetic and mechanical sounds of heavier bands such as Meshuggah to create a robotic behemoth capable of delivering an insidious, futuristic sound that would make you feel as though machine takeover is almost upon us.\n\nThe sound of the instruments delivers a hard, striking sound with a heavy amount of impact from all sides and just emanates a sound of inbound destruction. The guitars go on their stop and go riffing and chords that play off the robotic themes of the album and give you the illusions that robots actually are playing them, as well as the other instruments. The drums are struck with an impactful, slamming punch that adds to the overall crushing sound of the album and also enhances the robot theme. Burton Bell's vocals show off their versatility and strength by giving out a low roar for most of his vocals but also goes down low into death growl range and also delivers operatic, yet droning clean vocals that also give the impression a machine was generating them. The small amounts of industrial effects used in songs such as Zero Signal, New Breed, and Pisschrist finalize and round this albums sound and theme out as one of robotic domination.\n\nThe songs are arranged with jolting chords making up most of the rhythms in this album. They are hard and vicious, yet catchy and charmingly simple. The riffs on Replica, Demanufacture, and H-K (Hunter-Killer) are some of the most engaging and memorable, yet stylistically simple chords I have heard out of this genre. The clean vocals delivered by Bell give a soaring and atmospheric feel to the songs in which they are used, most emphasized on the extremely ethereal A Therapy For Pain. Overall, the theme of robot overlords and a technological slave state coupled with the slamming, machine-like instrumentation adds to the cutting fantasy and smart mystique of the album and it's sound.\n\nFor an album and a band with a theme about them, they certainly do it well. Fear Factory have delivered us a crushing, menacing piece of robotic brilliance. This album has many highlights and follows and perfects it's themes with sleek production, futuristic themes, mechanical playing styles and instruments. Demanufacture is a solid and original piece of groove, industrial, and trace amounts of death metal blended together with surgical precision, thumping heaviness, deadly jackhammer and sliding riffs, and memorable catchiness. For those of you looking to see what some of the best of metal in the 90's was, give this mechanical monster a listen and get ready to go on a futuristic adventure.\n",
        "\nTalk about utter brutality and annihilation in the sense of music of metal and variation. The whole of the release is totally intense and fueled with utter hatred, intensity, violence, and also at times severing away from the womb of metal where it doesn't seem like it's born. I mean in a sense that not everything here is totally brutal. There are times here that have utter atmospheric choruses and sheer perfection in the sense of sound plus production weaving it's metal way sifting through barriers and just severing the spirit equalling total metal invigoration, commencement, variability fueled with massive vibe of original metalish collection of tunes.\n\nBaffled me my first hearing years ago, then hearing Obsolete and thinking this album surpasses that one much more intensely. What we have here is a B-tuning guitar that's filled with such heaviness and crunch, goes well along with the heavy grunted vocals with it's manifestation of utter originality not mention genius in songwriting essence. And album that can be heard totally tons of times and be like maybe no way that you can get tired of it because it includes so many variations and atmospheres. The band really came together with such great thoughts in the way of making sounds like never heard before.\n\nAggressive vocals most of the time and the guitar just thick, chunky (as previously stated), bar chord complexity alongside clean vocals that goes well with it during those periods amongst the synthesizers that are orchestrated during chorus bits or just amiable errants of ringtone vox paving it's way to metal in a fashion like no other. The music overall is a complexity in effect making it hard to pinpoint where the up and down swings land themselves in, keeping the listener interested because of such variability. A total metal album that just fuels the fire of exasperating feel to it that makes it dominant in all aspects.\n\nRating this album as a 100% is not off in any way because I hear just utmost sincerity of pure imagination. That imagination is not more important than what is real here. We have guitars hitting home with no leads, but just heavy guitar bits, vocals that vary up all of the time, drums that just pound into your cranium with the mixing of these instruments was just mystifying and so well done. The quality is totally there. Some of the songs seemed to indicate a lack of proper definition, but that's where they got experimental with sound. Not everything is considered to be pure metal supremacy, but more so a total outlet of an experience to hear when you're pissed off or just want sounds.\n\nI'd have to conclude that the band as a whole really dominated in all aspects and Demanufacture is just a symbol of metal supremacy that's reinforced time and time again. Yes they did fool around with those wicked keys and not every song on here is totally with aggression, some with stagnant lack of perspiration, on the ones that make you sweat are the ones to capture the most of. Just taste a tune such as \"Self Bias Resistor\" and total imagination in writing achieves it's peak in complexity, tempo change and sheer metal domination. I'd say that this album as a whole was the bands best contribution to metal that they could've possibly achieved. Own this!\n",
        "\nFear Factory is perhaps the most extreme band ever to make a dent in the mainstream. I actually picked up a copy of Obsolete as a prize at my post-prom, of all places, back in 2000. Fast-forward to 2010, and the real Fear Factory's comeback album Mechanize was one of the first album reviews I ever wrote, giving it a 4 out of 5 star rating. You could say I'm a fan.\n\nThe Industrialist is a continuation from the core Fear Factory Obsolete/Mechanize industrial groove metal sound that I'm sure you already know, complete with the catchy, clean vocal choruses that let them put their feet in the door of the mainstream. Since there's no innovation or change in direction here, it's pretty easy to set it side by side with the other records in their catalog to see how it stacks up.\n\nThe core of the record consists of three absolutely killer tracks: opener \"The Industrialist,\" \"New Messiah,\" and \"Dissemble.\" The latter has a Meshuggah/djent chord or two, but aside from that all you need to know is they are blistering and memorable, just as Fear Factory should be. But outside of those, the record can be extremely tiresome. It almost loses me somewhere between the end of track 4 and the beginning of track 8. And I think I know why.\n\nWhile it's not that the rest of the record is utterly forgettable or boring, there's something about the soullessness of a drum machine. As I noted in my review of Mechanize, \"the drumming is what really makes it work,\" and there's no actual drummer. The incredible Gene Hoglan was of course not able to record, so instead of waiting for him, or finding a suitable replacement, they programmed it all. It's painfully obvious in the intro to the record, but the quality of the first few songs makes up for that. But after a while, the absence of soul becomes horribly obvious. Some people may argue that a drum machine is acceptable for an industrial metal band, or any band that's supposed to have a mechanical sound. Tell that to Tomas Haake.\n\nThe absence of true soul brought in by a flesh-and-blood drummer--even one as precise and apparently mechanical as Hoglan--makes The Industrialist drag in the middle. A few songs overcome the handicap, but overall it's just an OK album, when listened to completely. Yet again, I could barely make it through Streetcleaner, so maybe it's a problem with me. But the way I see it, this is the weakest FF record with Bell and Cazares on board.\n\noriginally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nWith \"The Industrialist\" released in early June earlier this year we saw Fear Factory go on without the rest of the Mechanize crew. Missing mainly percussionist powerhouse and metal legend Gene Hoglan as well as long-time bass player Byron Stroud. This means Burton and Dino composed and engineered this album all by themselves. And for a back to the basics album like \"The Industrialist\" these two members are more than enough to convey the music and themes present in the album.\n\nThe first song on the album is also the title track. Do you remember the title track on previous album \"Mechanize\"? If not, I can tell you that this song is similar in structure with an industrial/mechanical sample in the beginning of the song leading into the onslaught of Dino's tight riffs and Burton's screaming. The only difference between these tracks are that Burton has his own little spoken word monolouge dealing with the topic of religion in the very first minute of this song. It doesn't take long before the tight-as-hell rhythm guitar riffage of Dino kicks in with the programmed drum tracks interlocked beneath. The drums have the same overall sound as they did on \"Mechanize\", but you can clearly tell they are digitalized/synthetic this time around. If you've been missing out on Dino's riffage on former seminal Fear Factory tracks like \"Christploitation\", \"Self-Bias Resistor\" or even \"Corporate Cloning\". You will be pleased to hear that the dissonant and robotic machine-gun style riffage is back as intense as it has always been. Dino plays a few solos here and there on the album just like he did on \"Mechanize\". But the main melodic components of the album are still his guitar leads and the catchy synths/keyboards of Rhys Fulber. Burton is back in top shape just like he proved on \"Mechanize\", his screaming is full of rage and passion and this might just be his best harsh vocal performance to date. His clean vocals, although obviously enhanced and altered through the use of protools and other assets. Sound majestic and catchy as hell on tracks like \"New Messiah\" and \"Depraved Mind Murder\". He really gets to stretch his melodic vocal lines over Dino's chords on the refrains of songs like these, giving the songs memorability and lasting value. Some fans have complained that Dino and Burton copied and pasted from the compositions of \"Mechanize\" in both riffs and keyboards/samples. I beg to differ, and although I will admit there are some striking similarities between a few segments on both albums. There are hardly any riffs, vocal melodies or industrial samples that sound straight up plagiarized from past releases.\n\nThe concepts and themes of The Industrialist harken back to the days of \"Obsolete\" and \"Demanufacture\". The science fiction elements are back in place, just as they were in the good old days of Fear Factory. The lyrics still deal with topics like violence, religion and the hypocrisy of modern society. Albeit in the first person perspective of an automaton attempting to become more like a human being. I think there are some notable highlights on this album like the intense instrumental punishment of the riffs and drum parts of \"The Industrialist\". The epic, almost serenading chorus of \"New Messiah\" is another keeper for sure. Check out the syncopated double bass work and interesting lead playing in the refrain of \"Depraved Mind Murder\". Burton's singing sounds amazing on this track even though he doesn't really deviate from his usual singing style. It works wonders for the band when their skillful performances match their memorable songwriting. There is a heavy as all hell track near the end of the album called \"Disassemble\". I've always admired how Fear Factory can write mechanical music that is just as heavy as death metal, but doesn't spiral out of control into a cacophonous mess. This track is so damn heavy you feel like you are on a conveyor belt about to become ripped apart and stomped flat by vicious machines wielding razor blades and huge anvils.\n\nThere are a few unremarkable and lame moments on \"The Industrialist\". The single \"Recharger\" never really grabbed me because I felt the song was too calculated and formulaic. The riffs in the verse of the song are too repetitive and predictable and Burton's melodic lines don't really push any boundaries or remain in your memory for long. The fourth song titled \"God Eater\" starts off pretty cool with brassy keys and a piano part bringing to mind the intro of \"Christploitation\". The song gains some momentum in the verse as the downtuned riffage begins with Burton's lyrics shouted over it. Too bad \"God Eater\" is one or two minutes too long as the repetition really got out of hand and the song just turned into background music.\n\nOverall, this is a good if not great release by Fear Factory. I'm still hoping they can one day make amends with their former band mates Wolbers and Herrera, add them into the line-up once again and tap into the same brilliance present on their masterpiece \"Demanufacture\". Until then however, the Fear Factory we hear on \"The Industrialist\" will be more than sufficient.\n",
        "\nWhat compelled me to write this review? Well, fanboys did. Fear Factory\u2019s The Industrialist finally saw the light of the day and opinions were mixed all around the globe, yet I failed to see a really honest review on the internet. Here I\u2019ll try to be objective and neutral in my judgment, so you can get a proper opinion about the record. Yes, yes\u2026 fanboys made me do it.\n\nMany things were done right with this album, and many were done wrong also. The more obvious one, and subject of many arguments concerning the record, were the programmed drums. John Sankey helped Dino write the drum tracks and damn he did an impressive job, no doubt about it, yet still after a couple of listens one can\u2019t deny the fact that it makes the album sound a bit fake and plastic. That plus the eight string guitar tone of Dino\u2019s guitar, getting more and more soulless as time passes by. Not that he\u2019s loosing the mojo, not at all, his right hand is in perfect shape and the riff department delivers, as usual. But still, the tone you get out of an eight strings guitar just isn\u2019t the same as a normal one.\n\nAnother gripe I have with the album is Burt\u2019s voice. In Mechanize he kept his voice in a low range, avoiding to abuse the high notes, thing that proved to be a good move since he didn\u2019t get to sound annoying throughout the album and something that also helped him on stage, cause let\u2019s be honest, he can barely hold high tones live nowadays. Yet in this album he is all over the place with those vocals and the situation ends up in a mixed bag, sometimes it works, others doesn\u2019t. For example, New Messiah and Depraved Mind Murder were achievements, the contrast between screams and clean vocals works beautifully, plus Burt\u2019s \u201cgrowls\u201d sound ferocious when he just goes for it. But in songs like Virus of Faith or Difference Engine it didn\u2019t work so well and I feel it ruined a bit the songs.\n\nLetting Rhys to do the samplers on this album proved the band right once again and is one of the stronger points The Industrialist has. The talent of this guy nailing the most metallic parts of the record as well as the atmospheric ones is undeniable and, at this point, he should be considered a part of the band already. Listen to the transition between Disassemble and Religion is Flawed\u2026 and see what I mean.\n\nFinishing the album whit a track like Human Augmentation having already Religion is Flawed\u2026 wasn\u2019t really what I was expecting for and the remix of Difference Engine reminds me of New Breed (Spoetnik Mix), which isn\u2019t a good thing at all. Pitchshifter\u2019s cover was a good idea tho, here we can see the band sounding almost like how they used to sound in early demos and the album closes on a high note again.\n\nAfter all, you might think this isn\u2019t a good album since half of this review is criticism, but no, songs like The Industrialist, New Messiah and Depraved Mind Murder shows a solid Fear Factory, yes, I missed Gene or Ray behind the drums but even then what John Sankey did has its charm and is certainly impressive. People tend to compare everything the band does with Demanufacture, Obsolete or Mechanize, yet I think this record lands closer to Digimortal.\n\nI gave Mechanize 90/100 back in the day, The Industrialist doesn\u2019t gets closer to that, neither closer to the score Demanufacture or Obsolete have in my book, but it still stands proudly as a good FF album, a 70/100 would be the right score methinks. No fanboy bullshit, even when I admit it\u2019s my favourite band, just a honest opinion.\n",
        "\nIt has been over eight years since I last paid attention to anything that was put out under the Fear Factory moniker because they weren\u2019t making any material that was similar to \u201cDemanufacture\u201c, \u201cObsolete\u201c, or \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201c. Even when it was announced that Raymond Herrera (drums; Arkaea) and Christian Olde Wolbers (bass, guitars; Arkaea) were departing from the band so Dino Cazares (guitars; Asesino, Divine Heresy, ex-Brujeria) was to make his triumphant return, I still kept Fear Factory as written off. Much like I did with the latest Soulfly album, I am giving these industrial/groove metal giants another chance to try and win me back with their new album, \u201cThe Industrialist\u201c.\n\nI was impressed with the way the band used the opening on the first song, \u2018The Industrialist\u2019, by incorporating a sound (excluding the filtered voice over) that was reminiscent of something that would come from \u201cIn Their Darkened Shrines\u201d by Nile, which transcended into the trademark riffing of Dino. This was the Fear Factory that I had always loved, and I was excited to see this kind of return to form. \u2018Recharger\u2019 was no different except for the melodic chorus, which worked very well. After these two songs, I was ready to proclaim that Fear Factory had come to a realization as to what those two circular glands encased in flesh that dangled between their legs were for.\n\nWhile I could tell the band had definitely regained a lot of its old take-no-prisoners attitude, they still maintained that little bit of melody and experimented with some slower song structures, like \u2018God Eater\u2019, a plodding and melodic tune that spans nearly six minutes. Even \u2018Depraved Mind Murder\u2019 is a wonderful blend of these two styles that the band is known for. Unfortunately, after these five energetic songs is where \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d begins to stumble.\n\nWhat I mean by this is it seems that tracks like \u2018Difference Engine\u2019 and \u2018Disassemble\u2019 felt lifeless and hackneyed as soon as they start. These are the types of Fear Factory songs that made me forget their existence in the first place, especially during the chorus of \u2018Disassemble\u2019 where Burton sounds like a high school kid trying to sing cleanly during a talent show and doing a miserable job of it. Burton\u2019s voice sounds great on this album, so I have no idea why he took that approach in this particular instance. Not only that, but the opening riff of \u2018Virus Of Faith\u2019 is easily the most vicious in all of \u201cThe Industrialist\u201c. I was really hoping that the band would be able to capitalize on that genius and keep the energy going strong, but instead they just waste the rest of the song by basically re-writing \u2018Slave Labor\u2019 from \u201cArchetype\u201c. However, it had to be the last track, \u2018Human Augmentation\u2019 that annoyed me the most.\n\nWhen I saw it was just over nine minutes long, I figured I would be in for something that was similar to \u2018Resurrection\u2019 or \u2018Zero Signal\u2019, something ridiculously epic to cap off an album I really enjoyed. Instead what I was met with was \u201cbleep blorp heavy industrial noises we are machines Terminator boop beep\u201c. We get it, you guys are into this whole technological apocalypse stuff, give it a rest already. The only semblance of music that was in \u2018Human Augmentation\u2019 was the droning rumble of Matt DeVries bass, which you really needed to pay close attention for because he is buried underneath all of the other needless crap that was packed in. You won\u2019t even get something new for the entire length of the song, either. It\u2019s just an endless loop of the same reoccurring sound effects. This is what the band decides to end \u201cThe Industrialist\u201d with? I can\u2019t think of a worse way to end an album such as this. Unless you are Godflesh or Halo, then don\u2019t do this.\n\nI know I may have spent an enormous amount of time saying what I didn\u2019t like about \u201cThe Industrialist\u201c, but Fear Factory did a lot of things right this time around that must not be overlooked. You can tell that Dino\u2019s return has breathed some new life into the band and that is all we can hope for. This album is by no means a return to their old days, but there are enough glimmers of hope to get me interested in this band again. Now with the addition of Mike Heller of Malignancy* to be on drums for (hopefully) the next album, I will definitely be keeping my eyes on Fear Factory to see what they will come up with.\n\nOriginally written for Metal Blast: http://www.metalblast.net/2012/05/fear-factory-the-industrialist/\n",
        "\nIf you've ever heard of this album you'll notice it's sort of popular. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't know these guys actually wrote more than this album. The best way to put it is that this album is the \"Hipster's Industrial Metal Album\", but just like a new single from any irritating pop \"artist\", it's faded out. Probably because people woke up and realized that this album is awful.\n\nWe'll start with the vocals on this one. They sound very Max Cavalera-esque, and almost Justin Broadrick's Godflesh. Of course, these are just rip off's of it. Bell sounds like he's having issues when he sings. It's not pleasant on the ears and I listen to death metal too, so that says something. Trying to accurately portray his voice would involve a lot of unintelligent, the only way it's unintelligent is because he thought it was a good idea, screaming. The clean vocals are more bearable but it's hard to shine through the shit-smeared vocals commonly used. Ok, and the way he sings on \"A Therapy For Pain\" and \"Replica\". If you have a god start calling him awful because I cat being mutilated is more audibly pleasurable to a PETA member than Bell's vocals are on \"A Therapy For Pain\" to any human or should be to any human. He just sounds bad, plain and simple. Also, \"A Therapy For Pain\" is a tortuously long song. It's ten minutes but it drags on and on then they threw on some effects for two straight minutes and that's the worst song on the album in a nutshell. \n\nThe guitarists just sound uninspired. Seriously, the whole album is just palm muting and power chords. The same thing for three to five minutes. When \"H-K (Hunter Killer)\" started I almost expected to hear \"Demanufacture\" again. I've seen more variety from the various The Crow movies than these guys have when it comes to riffs. Any mongoloid can stand up there in a black t-shirt and cargo shorts, trying to look tough and fondling the guitar neck while they show off the one thousand palm-muting variations they came up with in their free time while head banging to the painful shouts of a man being beaten on stage. It's not impressive and it never will be. Maybe Fear Factory should just quit or change styles. As usual, the bass is buried under the mix. The drumming isn't as impressive as the guitars. It sounds like a drum machine was used since the music is very cut-and-paste oriented. Honestly, I'm just going to save you the same thing over and over because you'll hear it on the album if you don't heed my warnings to stay away.\n\nThe production is clear but the band probably needed it so you could hear just how repetitive the music is. There's a lot of effects on this album, but it's nothing to get excited about. It makes Bell's vocals sound worse, like on \"Demanufacture\". They also add no dynamic to the music. It's like they threw it in because they could not because it truly added anything. They appear in the form as pointless openers otherwise they're tossed in as is evident on \"Demanufacture\".\n\nI don't like the lyrics on this album. The chorus to \"Self Bias Resistor\" is cheesy, especially paired with the clean vocals of Burton Bell accompanied with the annoying vocal effect. \"Demanufacture\" has some bad lyrics too. Espcially the \"I've got no more goddamn regrets, I've got no more goddamn respect\". Singing like that I'd imagine no one would respect you. Never have I heard anyone utter such foolish words such as \"Burton Bell is a great vocalist\" or \"I draw inspiration from Burton Bell\". The part that's worse is when he degenerates it into \"Regrets, Respect\". It sounds moronic, because it is. They seem to try and mix lyrical themes with something mechanic. It doesn't work and it looks like they tried too hard to make it sound cool. I also have to note on \"New Breed\" Bell sounds like he's chanting \"War bred retard\" and \"New bride\". Not even close to what the lyrics say.\n\nFear Factory tried too hard to be badass here on this album. These shit-smeared mongoloids have produced one of the worst metal albums to exist. The fame overshadowed the actual ability of the band. It faded out before they could ride it's coattails all the way back into social relevancy. Unless you, just like a one night stand, got drunk and got stuck with this forsaken problem-child are still listening to the other festering bowel movements they've released. If only you noticed it sooner then you could've aborted this fetal issue, but now you've let it get 17 years old and no one wants it. I don't recommend this album to anyone. Whether you're interested in listening to industrial metal or are and avid listener to industrial metal you can live without listening to it. I was going to be nicer to this album and give it a 2% but it wasn't even that good.\n\n\"I don't wanna live that way, I don't wanna live that way\"- Burton Bell on Fear Factory's social relevancy.\n",
        "\nNot that this is techno\u2026 but it is Fear Factory. The typewriter drums of this band have always perplexed me. Too perfect, seemingly, but after seeing these dudes live with drummer Raymond Herrera I can rest assured that it\u2019s real. That was 2001, on a tour for the rather sub-par Digimortal, but despite the weak album, the live performance was aggressive and flawlessly executed.\n\n\u201cShock\u201d is exactly fucking that, a perfectly named and heavy as fuck opener to a brutal cyberthrash journey into the ionosphere. Here\u2019s the thing with Obsolete, the only real downfall, which indeed becomes apparent within this opening track, is repetition. Coming off the success of Demanufacture, Obsolete finds Fear Factory at a creative plateau; this album may well be the peak of this band\u2019s potential, it\u2019s angry yet polished, but at any rate, probably the darkest and most hateful of what this band would go on to do. Let me reiterate that Herrera is an absolutely crushing drummer. He and Dino seem to be locked into a formulaic system of composition for Obsolete, which lends to this conceptual album its needed feeling of continuity. The synchopated 32nd note machine gun riff of \u201cSecuritron\u201d is jaw-dropping in its pin-point accuracy. The soaring clean vocals of Burton C Bell spellbind the listener with Om-like vibration. Say what you will about the \u2018uplifting\u2019 melody of the single \u201cDescent,\u201d but the utterly nihilistic lyrics make for an aesthetic dichotomy. This song fucking rules. Fuck it, I don\u2019t care how poppy it sounds, there\u2019s no way I can keep from screaming \u201cNOOOO-THING\u201d when I hear it. \n\n\u201cFreedom or Fire\u201d is where things start to get nice and heavy. Can you say drum 'n' bass? Despite the dancy groove, this shit is fucking heavy, and as much as I hate this fucking word, the \u2018breakdown\u2019 that begins at 2:55 is absolutely ball crushing. The schizophrenic and thrashing chaos of the title track will fuck you up. \u201cObsolete\u201d flows flawlessly into the operatic grandeur of \u201cResurrection,\u201d a sci-fi disasterpiece that resolves itself in that weirdly uplifting feeling that is recurrent throughout this album.\n\n\u201cReach for the sky, touch the sky. Reach for a hope for mankind.\u201d\n\nSuch is the refrain of \u201cResurrection,\u201d which is at once an atheistic proclamation as well as a triumphant destroyer of conditioned boundaries. This is a great album. It\u2019s intellectual and catchy. It\u2019s well orchestrated and abrasively heavy. The closing piece, \u201cTimelessness\u201d is a brilliant rendering of the talented Burton Bell. An ambient end to a violent album, but conveys a feeling of closure nonetheless.\n\nObsolete also comes in a quite worth-it extended version with five additional tracks. A guilty pleasure, yeah, so what, but Fear Factory\u2019s cover of Gary Numan\u2019s \u201cCars\u201d is a total feel good rock and roll song, which is great if you feel good, and its waaay better that the original. Wiseblood tribute\u201c0-0\u201d is just plain evil, and very tastefully done, truly scary in its stark and sinister delivery. The other three tracks are FF originals, with \u201cConcreto\u201d being a particularly devastating beast.\n",
        "\nNu-metal, from 1996-2002 record labels such as Roadrunner encouraged their roaster to experiment with the worse music trend since hair metal. As a result we have Sepultura\u2019s Roots (1996), Machine Head\u2019s The Burning Red (1999) and Supercharger (2001), Soulfly\u2019s debut (1998) and Primitive (2000), and Fear Factory\u2019s Digimortal (2001).\n\nBeing a Fear Factory fan since Demanufacture (1995), I was surprised to hear Digimortal. Yes, Obsolete (1998) had some nu-metal moments but nothing significant. To be honest, the turntables on Edgecrusher really added to the song. Unlike Obsolete, Digimortal literally sounds like Fear Factory watered down.\n\nSeveral problems plague Digimortal from being considered a classic. The first and most obvious is that Burton C. Bell\u2019s vocals sound weak. During the time of its release I figured it was a result of abuse from years of touring, however, every album afterwards sounds much better. \n\nGuitar on this album is quite possibly some of the laziest guitar playing in metal history. Hell, Korn and Limp Bizkit wrote better riffs. Any Fear Factory fan would admit that, Dino Cazares isn\u2019t the best guitarist to begin with but his rapid-fire technique has been replaced with a few down tuned hammerons and mid pace rock riffs, for example Linchpin. This album actually feels like they\u2019re guitar parts missing on the final mix. For example, songs like Linchpin, Digimortal, and Hurt Conveyer only feature guitars in the introduction and chorus riffs. \n\nThe majority of songs feature the same verse/chorus/verse structure. Basically, you have an intro riff followed by the verse which usually only features bass and drums along with Bell\u2019s mediocre shouts. Then we get a big chorus with Cazares finally playing a riff or two, overtop Bell\u2019s clean singing. If you have the digipack, you\u2019ll have a few extra tracks that follow this exact pattern.\n\nThe saving grace of this album is Raymond Herrera\u2019s drumming and Christian Olde Wolbers\u2019 bass. Both instruments add some solid low end to the mix. Since Bell and Cazares half-assed this entire album, Herrera\u2019s drumming really stands out. Herrera fans should check out the tracks No One, Digimortal the pre chorus on Linchpin and the chorus of Back the Fuck Up (which actually makes this song somewhat enjoyable.)\n\nAs bad as this album is, Digimortal still sounds like a Fear Factory album unlike Machine Head\u2019s embarrassing nu-metal phase. Digimortal does feature a few hidden gems such as the two ballads Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies) and (Memory Imprints) Never End both being some of Fear Factory\u2019s better ballads. The production is the best of Fear Factory\u2019s career, minus the half-assed delivery of both Bell and Cazares. The tracks are crisp and full of futuristic ambience. Yes, Back the Fuck Up does feature B-Real of Cypress Hill as well as awkward rap vocals by Bell, but thankfully Digimortal doesn\u2019t drag on too long.\n",
        "\nSadly, Fear Factory has been draw into two camps similar to Sepultura. Back in 2002, vocalist Burton C. Bell quit because of feud with guitarist Dino Cazares. Bassist, Christian Olde Wolbers and drummer, Raymond Herrera decided to fire Cazares so Bell would return. The result, Archetype (2004) and Transgression (2005), both seemed to foreshadow a bright future. \n\n2009, Cazares and Bell reconciled their feud and decided to phase of Wolbers and Herrera. Byron Stroud would remain Fear Factory\u2019s bassist, a role he\u2019s played since Cazares exit. Herrera is replaced by heavy metal scab, Gene Hoglan. Early 2010, this new incantation of Fear Factory released Mechanize.\n\nThe album\u2019s strongest moments are in the vocal department. Bell\u2019s screams sound fierce and intimidating, especially for his age. Clean vocals are your typical Fear Factory clean vocals you\u2019d expect. Rhys Fulber also returns as producer and keyboardist, bringing back that classic Terminator atmosphere. \n\nUpon first listen, you might notice Cazares has upgraded to the 8-string guitar. The problem is, the 8 string\u2019s tone sounds hollow, especially when hitting the F# and B strings. This can be heard during the opening riffs of Mechanize and Oxidizer. Note: for further examples of this sound, check out Meshuggah\u2019s Obzen and Ihsahn\u2019s After. \n\nAnother flaw of the album, like current Machine Head, Cazares sounds like he wrote Mechanize with the intention of distracting fans of his nu-metal phase ten years ago. By the use of recycled riffs and trendy metalcore leads, Mechanize sounds more like a third Divine Hersey album. \n\nThe biggest problem on Mechanize is the drums. Yes, Gene Hoglan is a good drummer and to the untrained ear sounds like Raymond Herrera, but to a long-time Fear Factory fan, you can tell the difference. \n\nHerrera was responsible for pioneering the \u201cstop and go\u201d double bass kick. This technique is one most important aspects of Fear Factory. Herrera doesn\u2019t simply trigger his set to hide mistakes. What makes Herrera\u2019s hits so unique is that they\u2019re precise and still audible. Hoglan\u2019s, drumming on Mechanized sounds like a wall of sound, quite similar to his work in Strapping Young Lad. This may sound good in Strapping, but not Fear Factory. \n\nIn conclusion, there are two ways to look at this album. The first, this is quite possibly one of the heaviest Fear Factory albums. Or the second, long-time fans may be confused and alienated by this sudden \u201cPowershift.\u201d In 2004, Archetype made it pretty clear that Dino was considered an \u201cinfection\u201d to the machine. In, 2010 that same infection is back minus half of the machine (Wolbers & Herrera). One might say that the soul of this machine has been removed.\n",
        "\nWow.\n\n2010 was a year of surpises for me, good and bad, and Mechanize is most definitely one of the good ones.\n\nThough I've often enjoyed Fear Factory, in particular Demanufacture and Obsolete, they've rarely actually blown me away, until I heard this album that is. This is the very definition of a band revitalised and showing the world just what they're capable of.\n\nThe most immediately striking aspect is the sheer unbridled rage. This album is ferocious, it is furious, coming out as an aural assault of brutality the likes of which they haven't had since their death metal tinted debut. Though there are still the occasional more melodic breaks, the whole album is on an unstoppable rampage from start to finish. With each new song I kept thinking, \"Surely this is where it eases off the gas\", but no, it just keeps on coming. While still firmly in keeping with their earlier sounds, here the band take a distinctly thrash-oriented turn, full of aggressive speed and thrashing riffs.\n\nThis raw intensity is due in no small part to the master of metal percussion, Gene Hoglan. To be a complete geek and quote Obi Wan, \"He's more machine now than man\". Few drummers are capable of genuinely transforming an album for me, but Hoglan enhances everything he comes into contact with, adding a whole new layer to the sound and giving Mechanize just the punch it needs.\n\nHe's not the only thing doing that though. Everything on this album is geared towards smashing your fucking skull in. Dino and Byron's guitar work perfectly meshes with Gene's drumming, coming at you like a bulldozer with Burton Bell roaring atop it and sounding more enraged than he has in a decade. The album trashes along at breakneck pace with riffs and drums pounding away, yet like the vicious-looking cover art it's capable of a little more finesse as well, and the music picks just enough times to ease up and become catchy to keep it from sounding repetitive, as in some of the choruses or the epic closer, Final Exit.\n\nOpening title track Mechanize showing their intention perfectly, the explosive roar of Fear Campaign, the religious outrage of Christploitation, the infectiousness of Powershifter and Controlled Demolition, the band keep on throwing more and more at the listener. Really, it shouldn't have come as a surprise to me that a band half Fear Factory and half Strapping Young Lad would craft such a masterpiece of industrial-thrash annihilation, but after a few distinctly average albums I never expected something like this. In Mechanize Fear Factory have crafted the album of their career, every aspect that defines their sound cranked up to 11 and then some.\n",
        "\nMechanize, the long awaited album by L.A.\u2019s most famous machine-like metallers Fear Factory is finally here\u2026 the first single, Powershifter, did put expectations sky high for sure yet, does Mechanize live up to the hype or is just another hit and miss album in today\u2019s over polluted metal scene? I would say yes, it does, it certainly does and what is more important, it sounds fresh for what it is, a Fear Factory record\u2026 yeah! maybe you don\u2019t like Fear Factory\u2019s style and you think it\u2019s always the same with them but I\u2019ll get things clear once and for all on what\u2019s relative to that topic, just keep reading\u2026 avoid the haters people, this is what Mechanize really is.\n\nSo, do you wanna know how Mechanize sounds? Well, my answer to that is that Mechanize sounds mechanized indeed\u2026 you got all the classic things Fear Factory always had yet, this time, we got a brand new element to appreciate and that element is no other than legendary drummer Gene Hoglan going berserk at the rhythmic section. Hoglan\u2019s contribution to the band\u2019s classic sound is, with no doubt, his ferocious thrashier edge, leaving absolutely no doubt he is the drummer this new Fear Factory incarnation deserves, tracks like Industrial Discipline and Christploitation shows him filling the spot like no other could ever do, nailing an absolutely monstrous performance, mechanical yet completely organic (you won\u2019t get the feeling you\u2019re listening to pro-tools and such, no matter how machine-like the songs are)\u2026 in two words, energetic and memorable, he\u2019s simply all over the place with flawless execution, doing justice to the legend his name already is.\n\nBut what\u2019s even more obvious than Gene behind the drum kit? I\u2019ll tell you what, Dino Cazares once again on the 8 strings, that\u2019s what! You know, I\u2019ll never get all the haters bitching about him playing the same riff all the time cause he\u2019s, obviously, not playing the same riff all the time, you must be deaf and also have an extremely diminished IQ level to avoid the fact he\u2019s not playing the same riff all the time! What you do get here is his classic guitar picking style yet with a thrashier approach and here is where I wanna make a point, would you tell Trey Azagthoth to change his guitar picking style just cause a thousand bands have ripped off his trademark to boredom? No, of course you won\u2019t, so yeah, Dino deserves an amount of respect equivalent to his weight for being one of the most imitated guitar players ever to grace the metal scene yet he\u2019s still capable of pulling out insane right hand riffing without being generic like most clones do. Dino\u2019s back, thrashier and heavier than ever (literally).\n\nNow, if I would have to make a critic to the band\u2019s sound, what would it be? Easy question, the bass being always way too low in the mix\u2026 I know what Byron Stroud\u2019s capable of and I would love to hear him without having to concentrate on getting the bass tracks while I\u2019m listening to the album. I guess he does what he\u2019s supposed to do and that\u2019s adding the low-end to the music\u2026 but still, imagine an entire album with a bass mix like the one you get on Replica\u2019s Electric Sheep Mix and tell me you don\u2019t think that\u2019s something to look forward to, lie to me.\n\nSo, for someone into the whole Fear Factory sci-fi world, what\u2019s the strongest point of this album? Yes, the conceptual theme\u2026 Burton C. Bell is, and will always be, Fear Factory\u2019s main man, not because of his voice but his lyrics. This time, he went for a different approach yet keeping the main \u201cman becoming machine\u201d theme he have been developing since the Demanufacture days. He wrote a full-on critic to USA\u2019s terrorist state and his fear campaign to justify an illegal war made up to establish a fascist new world order, it\u2019s not sci-fi anymore, it\u2019s about reality, about our reality, about what we all have had to witness this last decade and oh boy he did a good job at getting himself clear with that, take a look at songs like Fear Campaign or Controlled Demolition and see for yourself what's Burt accusing\u2026 but of course great lyrics demands great vocal performances and I assure you, there\u2019s nothing to fear, he sounds just as aggressive as the rest of the band and this time he keeps his clean vocals in a lower range, kudos for that, there\u2019s no need to go high-pitched on us every time you get a chorus verse so, this way, everything follows a proper standard that makes the album flow smoothly.\n\nAs far as production goes everything\u2019s done perfectly, sterile sound with triggered drum kicks plus a killer guitar tone, typical Fear Factory \u2026 check Christploitation and Oxidizer for some awesome keyboard sections courtesy of Rhys Fulber, Fear Factory\u2019s main producer that\u2019s also back on the folder. The artwork is nicely done, specially the album cover and, as a product, I would say it\u2019s definitely a good buy, so I can safely say, this is the Fear Factory album we all have been waiting for, avoid the haters, the score Mechanize truly deserves is hands down a 90 out of 100\u2026 this is the album that blends all the Fear Factory elements in perfect balance, what Mechanize really is!\n",
        "\nAfter many years of playing some of the most emotionally intense drumming in metal in Strapping Young Lad, the famous Gene Hoglan has finally released his first solo album! Needless to say, I\u2019ve been anticipating this for a long time, and now I can finally review my drumming idol\u2019s debut solo release.\n\nThe album starts off with some cheesy-as-fuck electronics. I never knew that Hoglan was into the whole \u201ccyber-apocalypse\u201d theme that some old shitty band that I can\u2019t quite remember used, but whatevs, man. The electronics might not sound original, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m listening to Gene Hoglan\u2019s solo album.\n\nWhy the fuck is some bad guitarist playing shitty riffs on top of Gene\u2019s drumming? Like, holy fuck, Gene has some pretty cool rhythms going on, but this awful guitarist is just chugging away. Maybe this is some avant-Gene method of obscuring his wonderful instrument that will someday be the craze in awesome metal. Well, whatever it is, I can\u2019t quite say that I like it. Anything covering up his drums is a bad idea. Shit, now a whiny vocalist is \u201csinging\u201d about some shit that I honestly couldn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about. But the drums! The rhythms are pretty subtle under all the shit in the way, but they sound pretty nifty. I don\u2019t think it tops his older work, but it\u2019s certainly worth hearing for the subtleties if you\u2019re a fan of his older work (as you should be!).\n\nI think Gene is just trying to prove that even under countless layers of shit, his drumming will reign supreme. This avant-Gene techinique is actually working quite well, then. When he was in other bands, I unfortunately had to devote some effort into listening to those other chumps like Devin Townsend and Chuck Schuldiner play good guitar parts and provide good vocals. That distracted me from Hoglan\u2019s drumming prowess. Luckily, that is not the case here! All I have to do is focus on how awesome Gene is!\n\nYou know how some black metal bands make their music intentionally \u201craw\u201d sounding for atmospheric effect? Maybe that\u2019s what Gene is doing here. I mean, it\u2019s not like the guitarist or vocalist are contributing to the music in any other way\u2013that\u2019s Gene\u2019s fucking territory! Don\u2019t fucking mess with Gene\u2019s fucking territory! Still, the shrouding of his drums underneath the murk of chugging guitar riffs just adds more mystique to the legend that Hoglan has created for himself through his music.\n\nThe rhythms on this album are all consistently catchy, groovy, and subtly complex. Unfortunately, it feels like this style of music doesn\u2019t fit his skill set too well, so all I\u2019m wondering is why he is playing this instead of some more chaotic material or ballsy death metal. Surely that would be a better use of his talents than making this relatively restrained solo album. Still, these other chump musicians would probably sound like the worst band ever without Gene.\n\nAs I keep listening to this, I\u2019m noticing how the other noises going on always seem to be following the drums. It\u2019s like Gene\u2019s masterful drumming is leading a \u201cnoise parade\u201d of sorts, and these other \u201cmusicians\u201d are the floats blindly following him that wouldn\u2019t dare change their path for any reason. They follow him at all times, with no exception! I just don\u2019t get why Gene would want these other horrible floats following him. I mean, the awesome leading float is great and all that stuff, but the other floats are such a let down.\n\nGene, please get better floats next time you make a solo album.\n\nSincerely,\n\nZiltoid\n\nWritten for http://thenumberoftheblog.com/\n",
        "\nI've been a long-time FF fan since Demanufacture, introduced to said album through Headbanger's Ball and the video for \"Replica\" back in the early 90's (i think). Even though I've loved this band immensely for quite a few years, I must admit that they were treading the waters of mediocrity with Archetype and especially Transgression. \n\nWhen I heard Dino was back, I was fuckin thrilled. When I heard about the inclusion of the goddamned almighty Gene Hoglan, I was extatic!! \n\nWell, after spending the past few weeks ingesting this album, I'm glad to say that this band's birthed a monster of an album! I would describe it as a modern era Demanufacture, with cleaner production that works to enhance and sharpen the clarity and attack of every instrument.\n\nThe big difference in this album from anything else Fear Factory has produced in the past is the lack of Rhys' contributions. Its few and far between, but Rhys' contributions are utilized for maximum dramatic effect. There's a greater emphasis on heaviness and straight-ahead attack. Gene's all over the place here, and I mean that in a good way! His fills and patterns are incredibly crafty and clever in their delivery; he maintains a consistent level of freshness in his playing throughout every track. Burton sounds fuckin pissed off throughout, like someone seriously knocked him in the grapes! His melodic vocals are more ranged at some parts, yet he sounds like his old familiar self. Dino's better on this album, the difference on this album are his solos. He doesn't produce any real face-melters on this album (has he ever in FF?), his solos are more the type that work to accentuate the melody and add to the overall feel of the song. \n\nThe only reason why I knock off 20 points from this review is due to tracks 7, 8, and 9. These songs really don't go anywhere and leave no lasting impression on the listener's mind, they're sort of just \"there\". The last track \"Final Exit\" is true to the time-tested FF formula of having a melodically progressive closing track to the album. It deals with death and the final thoughts that one goes through. I found it to be quite beautiful, but also quite depressing. I think it would hit anyone who's experiencing the death of a loved one pretty hard, its a mature and gripping track. If anything, I'd recommend this track over the rest for it's feeling and the fact that it highlights the emotionality that FF specializes in, that makes them truly unique.\n\nWell, that's the long and skinny of it. This is my first review on this site, and I pumped it out at midnight with work looming in the early morning! \n\nNotables: Industrial Discapline, Fear Campaign, Christploitation, Final Exit.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ll admit it now; me and FEAR FACTORY haven\u2019t had a good relationship. I wasn\u2019t too thrilled by their earlier deathly roots and found their later KORN-fed machinations all the more abhorrent. Still, prattled on they did, churning out albums and tours despite their apparent dismissal from the overt popularity radar screen, And outside of seeing a few songs of theirs live back in 2005 I\u2019d pretty much forgotten they were still around (save for rumbling news on behalf of a few projects that contained the FACTORY workers), and as a result I wouldn\u2019t know how time had worked for them lo these many successive years.\n\nAnd with that, my curiosity as to how re-or-demanufactured FEAR FACTORY had become became a bit too loud to ignore\u2026\n\nWell, I know this much\u2026they still don\u2019t really throw me. And if nothing else they seem low on gas in this regard. While I am not counting their way too processed production values (theirs is of the mechanized type, thus the album name, I get that), the artificiality is also equal in part with the musical scheme of things, which does nothing for anyone save for the band themselves and what fan base is still present. There\u2019s attempts at brutality present, as if the band spent a few months improperly ingesting mid-to-late-era SOILWORK before it came time to write this new album, but for the most part FEAR FACTORY take the nu metal/hardcore elements that made them a household name in the 90s for Adidas-clad wiggery, Mansonites and those who raged against the machine to a new level of banality, where faux machismo, feeble acts of \u201cheaviness\u201d and attempts at modern melodic tendencies do nothing to coalesce or gel into anything that tickles the ear drum. To make matters worse it also doesn\u2019t seem like the band gives a damn this time around; a sensation of simply going through the motions is in play, where the gear-grating guitar riffs, drum machine-emulating percussion (always sweet how one-time mainstream acts take to blast beats like it could very well be a new feature) and a combination of hardcore shouts, whiny clean vocals and attempts at further vocal grimness may work for the band at a performance level, but when it comes to actually LISTENING to this dreck, it doesn\u2019t work. At all. And it\u2019s even more irritating when the band toys with you; the way they seemingly have the ability to create decent riff work but spend most of the time interspersing the stop-start -core bullshit over and over and over again until you\u2019re begging for mercy\u2026huh\u2026maybe that\u2019s what they were shooting for. Nevertheless, this makes for a bothersome, overtly digitized listen that could\u2019ve been better created by studio gimmickry rather than a collection of real musicians, as songs like \u201cIndustrial Discipline\u201d, \u201cPowershifter\u201d and \u201cOxidiser\u201d show as bright as the molten metal they seem to want to musically create.\n\nIn the end the latest FEAR FACTORY again reminds me of everything I never liked about this band. And for all the increase in melodic heaviness, it still sucks and I\u2019m better off staying away from the factory for good. Oh well.\n",
        "\nI've always been a huge Fear Factory fan. Demanufacture was just awesome. Obsolete was freaking epic. OK, Digimortal was a little weird in places, and Transgression...well, at least they had the crushing Archetype between them, right? After Transgression, the drama that has plagued the band since Digimortal decided to come back in a new fashion. Nobody knew what to expect when Burton and Dino announced that a new Fear Factory album was in the works. Well, the album got made, and damn, this is the best thing I've heard in a pretty long time. Overall, this is just a solid blast of classic Fear Factory aggressive sonic domination. Dino can still play. In fact, the riffs on this album seem a lot more intricate in places than the band's usual guitar work. Burton is still one of the most under appreciated singers out there. Byron is Byron, and Gene Hoglan has proven all of the doubters wrong, showing that he can play Fear Factory's high-intensity drum beats with remarkable proficiency.\n\nBefore continuing to praise Mechanize, it's important to realize that the album isn't perfect. There are some negatives on the album, just like with any other CD. The difference with Mechanize is that the negatives are pretty minor and don't distract from the album as a whole. OK, Burton sounds a little bit strained in his screaming at times, but come on, the dude is 40. When he cleans it up in places, such as the chorus of Fear Campaign, he's still a vocal force to be reckoned with. The other main nitpick with Mechanize is that some of the songs seem a bit short. Take Industrial Discipline, for example. It blasts along, and then goes into a dead-cool breakdown at the end. But, all of a sudden, the song just seems to stop. A few of the tracks have this problem, where they seem to be a little stripped down, or perhaps purposely shortened. But overall, those are pretty minor gripes given the strength of the album as a whole.\n\nWith the negatives out of the way, what are the strong points? Well, basically, the whole damn thing. I can't get over how good this album is, as is evidenced by the fact that it's pretty much all I've been listening to for a while now. Mechanize just refuses to get old or lose its impact. It\u2019s also hard as hell to isolate the strongest tracks. They damn sure made a good choice for the first video single, Fear Campaign. Fear Campaign is one of Fear Factory's best songs, and not just on Mechanize. Oh crap, is that Dino playing a lead in there? Seriously? A little more of that type of experimentation on future releases and Fear Factory might evolve into something even more bombastic. Another absolutely awesome track is Oxidizer. The breakdown/out-chorus at the tail end just begs to be blasted at obscene volume. Had they repeated that bit for 45 minutes, they'd still have delivered a serious album. Controlled Demolition is another standout, even if Burton has apparently missed the fact that all of the post-9/11 \"the government blew up the Twin Towers\" crap has been debunked by basic science. But regardless, it's still a damn good song musically, even if the flawed message is a bit out of date at this point anyway. The rest of the CD, including the album's teaser release Powershifter, is just as good as those three tracks. Another aspect of the album that really drives it over the top is the really solid work by Rhys Fulber. This is not surprising, as he was the man behind the electronic soundscapes of Obsolete. That aspect of Fear Factory's music really stood out on Demanufacture and Obsolete. It seemed to be a bit of an afterthought on later releases, so it's nice to see it return with more force and effect on Mechanize. When the band is hitting on all cylinders, they seem to be creating atmospheres rather than songs, and Fulber's work is a key element to that style.\n\nAt the end of the day, this will stand out as one of the best metal albums of 2010, and one of the best in Fear Factory's catalog. If you really want to know what this album represents, it's what Megadeth and Metallica have been trying to do for well over a decade now: recapture past energy and musical vitality. Megadeth is coming along while Metallica seems to be stumbling around, but Fear Factory has obliterated both of them in both the effort and the results. Here's hoping that they stay the course and deliver us an equally solid release the next time around.\n",
        "\nHow long has it been since there has been a Fear Factory album that was so intense it pretty much ripped your face off every second that it spun? Years? Probably not since Demanufacture for most fans, with Archetype coming in a close second. Well, after the atrocity that was Transgression, Fear Factory have reunited with Dina Cazares on guitars, and bring us the album we have all long been waiting for: Mechanize. This album is fueled by absolute intensity, melody, and technicallity, just what we all have come to know and expect from their releases. Welcome back, Fear Factory.\n\nThe title track of Mechanize is simply breath taking, but in the sense of that is crushes you to the point where you can't breath. However, this punishing track doesn't really set the tone of the album, though it's far from the heaviest track available. What comes next is a combination of various elements that have made Fear Factory a household name. Many of the tracks come at you in a blistering assault that blends furious music throughout with a more melodic chorus that is sung, the main thing that put the band on the map. But when you hit \"Christploitation\", things seem to change up a bit and we go right back to furious and angry Fear Factory that would make any of their recent discography quiver in fear.\n\nEverything on here goes great until you hit the track \"Designing the Enemy\". While this track isn't that bad at all, it just feels so out of place and tame compared to the rest of the album. The track is slower, has simpler Meshuggah-esque guitar riffs and drum kicks to it, and severely watered down focusing more on singing then anything else until a little more then half way through, when the whole thing comes into perspective a bit thanks to the distorted gutteral vocals, then back to the clean singing. It acts as a nice intermission if you want to consider it that way, but it does disrupt the flow of the album and will have you itching to strike the skip track button. It's clear that this track was added to prepare you for the closing track \"Final Exit\", as \"Designing the Enemy\" and the isntrumental track \"Metallic Division\" make for a more powerful closing to the release, but even if you look at that song as a form of interpretation to the album as a whole, it's still not that great a track. Had it been left out and let it end with \"Metallic Division\" and \"Final Exit\" instead, it would have been perfect, since the entire album rips your face off, but then gives you a feeling of hope and closure at the end.\n\nDeluxe Edition:\nThe Deluxe Edition of Mechanize comes in a nice digipack, and comes complete with four bonus tracks. The first of the four is a newly recorded track entitled \"Crash Test\" which is very diverse from the rest of album, beaing a very heavy and intense song that relies more on the band's older Death Metal roots then anything of the more established Groove Metal sound. This makes for a very furious track that fans of the original sound will like, but the track doesn't have much of a lasting appeal here, and seems to be one of those songs that would gain a bigger response live if used to really get the crowd pumped during the performance. Aside that, you also have the band's entire second 1991 demo tape recording placed on here as a bonus. It's great to hear some of the classic songs from earlier Fear Factory as they originally were when they were first recorded, before the record deal and access to better production equipment. These tracks are clearly a plus and worth the few extra dollars to obtain.\n\nMechanize, with the exception of \"Designing the Enemy\", is hands down one of the best Fear Factory releases in nearly fifteen years. The album is just a non stop thrill ride from start to bottom, and ends on such a powerful high note that actually resolves this album, giving you closure, which is something that many albums seem to lack anymore. This is one album that will be lodged in your player, and that you'll probably wear out from repeat listens before you even attempt to touch another release. If you're going to be any new release for this year, make sure you pick up Mechanize. \n\nOriginally posted on Apoch's Metal Review\nwww.apochs.net\n",
        "\nOnly a very few albums can be considered as essentials or revolutionary through the history of the metal scene. During the last decades an astonishing amount of works have been released, most of them mediocre, some of them excellent and a few of them masterpieces, but even less deserve the status of groundbreaking or revolutionary as I have said before.\n\nFear Factory\u00b4s sophomore album, the worldwide acclaimed Demanufacture is one of them. It is well known that the 90s were a time for a splendid evolution in the metal world, when the expansion of the range of styles were enormous and demostrated how metal music could be combined with an amazing variety of sounds. Los Angeles located band supposed the perfect example of this tendency. FF was the very first band who combined death metal growls, cutting riffs and extreme drums with electronic sounds, creating a new hybrid style. Today\u00b4s yet imitated Burton\u00b4s vocals (a combination of growls and clean voices), the precise and fast double bass drums patterns and the electronic atmosphere shocked all the fans who listened to their music at that time.\n\nDemanufacture was born as the perfected version of this new style, where the band took the brutality from this debut, refinned the sound, added some ambient keyboards and created an amazing futuristic atmosphere. This addition was basic to reinforce the sense of their lyrics, which related to how a technological obsessed civilization had lost its humanity and was destroyed by the machines they had created. The album begins with an instant classic, the homonym song, the atmospheric synthetizer mixed with the initial riff and double bass drum is legendary and the perfect definition of the band. The song itself is a crushing continuation of low tunned riffs, tremendous drums and the charismatic vocals which flow from the semi-growls to the amazing clean vocals.\n\nThe first part of the cd is absolutely unbeatable. The second song, Self Blias Resistor, is even heavier, and has an amazing final chorus. Zero Signal is one of the most futuristic songs with an amazing atmosphere and a touching final piano. Following these ones we find the most famous composition of the band, Replica, being sincere is not one of their best songs but it is straightforward and has a killer chorus, it was the perfect single and was presented with an original video.\n\nThe second part of the work maintains the great level although there are not songs as good as the first ones until we reach almost the end. When Pisschrist begins an industrial anthem smashes our brains, believe me this song is tremendous!. In my opinion it should be considered as the most dramatic, dark an epic piece ever created by these guys. The beginning is very characteristic with the industrial intro and Herrera\u00b4s impassive drums, Burton sings here amazingly and with a great ferocity and the rhytmic guitars are very mechanic and hammering. But the best is yet to come, the final chorus is absolutely marvellous, the clean vocals sound apocalyptic, and the keyboards create a dark and majestic atmosphere. All finishes with the repetitive and frightening chorus \u201c Where is your saviour now?\u201d. Absolutely tremendous!\n\nIn conclusion this album has not only been considered as a masterpice but also as a landmark in the metal music scene, being a reference to the next generations. A must have!!\n",
        "\nWell I\u2019m not going to lie about anything when it comes to Fear Factory. They are one of those bands with their albums they tend to go through this Bi-Polar string of releases where the last one was considered shitty and now the new one there are all back and angry and with \u201cMechanize\u201d they are just that. They\u2019re back and sounding more pissed than ever. And that is where I\u2019m having a problem at.\n\nFear Factory are a band that is known and has been known to create some wonderful pieces of music be it \u201cZero Signal\u201d, \u201cBig God/Raped Souls\u201d, even \u201cResurrection\u201d and \u201cSlave Labor\u201d are all excellent pieces of musical aggression that will have most metal heads giving two thumbs up and most entry-level metal heads blowing their loads over in sheer amazement. Even with Fear Factory doing this, they\u2019ve sure made a lot of filler. Not because the music sucks, it\u2019s just hard to top a song like \u201cZero Signal\u201d or \u201cPiss Christ\u201d on your album and expect the listener to take the rest of the album seriously or the vast majority of your music. On \u201cMechanize\u201d we see Fear Factory going for broke in the aggression department. I mean, if anyone knows anything about Fear Factory, they can bring the hurt. The shitty thing is that to ME, not any other listener, it\u2019s hurting my ears. It\u2019s like they forgot a lot of what they were trying to do over the years and just said double-bass, synchronized palm-muted riffs, Burton\u2019s trademark melodic/growling/shouting vocals that every single band seems to deliberately rip-off these days (and poor fucking Burton is never given the credit where it\u2019s due). It has all the Fear Factory musical trademarks. But it just seems like they are trying way too hard.\n\n\u201cMechanize\u201d starts off\u2026wait\u2026I\u2019m sorry did I pop-in \u201cDemanufacture\u201d by mistake? We hear the opening title track which gets things started off on the right foot. No fucking around here. But it lacks something, in which I am not sure. \u201cIndustrial Discipline\u201d starts off the same way, but picks up the tempo a bit faster, but we get more of Burton C\u2019 Bells melodic vocals. \u201cFear Campaign\u201d continues and\u2026.now I know what is bothering me about this album; IT SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE DIVINE HERESY. With original guitarist Dino Carzers coming back into the fold after a long hiatus, but subtracting the other half of the band, it's half of the deliverance of the songs. Burton C. Bell's vocals half of the time seemed forced and contrived. You would think with Gene Hoglan laying down drums and even getting long-time keyboardist Rhys Fulber it would be out-fucking-standing......but it's lacking the power. The few stand-out tracks here are \u201cPowershifter\u201d, \"Industrial Discipline\", and the last song \u201cFinal Exit\u201d which for the first time since I was a kid in high school has been able to be put in the top of the Fear Factory crop of songs that will gets stuck in your head for days. My best friend has been raging about this album because it is supposed to be an attempt for Fear Factory to be that raging machine again, but in the end, it sounds too forced. It\u2019s not a bad album and if you are a die-hard Fear factory fan, you\u2019ll no doubt love it, but for me, I rather pop-in \u201cDemanufacture\u201d at the end of the day.\n",
        "\nThe 90's was an exciting time for Metal just as much as the 80's folks. Stop bullshitting yourselves into thinking everything about 90's Metal was bad...it was just the last quarter or so of the decade that seemed fucking hopeless but for the majority so many new roads were paved and if there is one road which was paved well, so well that only 1 or 2 bands that can go down on it could not be re-produced by any means. That road was paved by Ministry with their untouchable album \"Pslam 69\". The only other band that could travel down is none other than Fear Factory. If \"Pslam 69\" was a dirty drag car hopped-up on speed, then \"Demanufacture\" is a huge war-torn tank slowly destroying everything in it's path. Fuck Meshuggah, they started almost and found out that they should have taken a left turn at Alberquerque.\n\n1995's \"Demanufacture\" is THE Industrial Metal album to own. Everything about the album is right on target; the album, lyrical themes, musical composition, sound production, energy, and level of agression has yet to be matched by majority of the bands out there these days. Imagine all those classic sci-fi movies you know and remember; \"Terminator\" series, \"Blade Runner\", \"Aliens\", etc. Imagine the desolation and freezing darkness those movies projected. Fear Factory takes all that and induces it ten-fold. And in some weird way, Fear Factory even gives a history lesson and a glimpse into the future on Industrial music in general....I'll go more into that idea later on. They clearly wear their influences on their sleeves and are not afraid of showing the direction of where aggressive music was headed towards.\n\nThe musicians on here are hitting on all creative cylinders. The stand-out performance of Dry Lung Vocal Matyr singer Burton C. Bell did something which no other band had done before. Combining screaming/shouting verses that are clearly inspired by Godflesh/Napalm Death's Justin Broadrick and melodic choruses that would put a smile on Killing Joke's apocalyptic madman Jaz Coleman. Burton's melodic singing is so well-sung that the first few listens you are left with goosebumps. Guitarist Dino Carzares's riffs are well-constructed Death/Thrash metal riffs but appear to be a more down-tuned Ministry. Although Christian Olde Wolbers is credited as bass duties, Dino does all bass duties on here. And last but not least is drummer Raymond Herrera....motherfuck...if there is one drummer to be credited for triggered drums, it's him. No other band maybe besides Morbid Angel were using triggered drums for the most part for the first half of the 90's. Raymond's drums directly influenced the machine-gun drumming. At first I had to double check to see if they weren't using a goddamn .50 caliber machine gun.\n\nSound production is handled by both Colin Richardson and Front Line Assembly's mainman Rhys Fulber. I seriously believe that Colin Richardson had nothing to do with this album because if it weren't for Rhys' Industrial/Techno background and touch this album would be very skeletal in just drums/guitars/vocals. Rhys' takes his futuristic profession to an entire new level on this album and was definately influenced by FF as well on future albums with Front Line Assembly. In essence, Fear Factory may have changed the entire course of Industrial music. Remember what I said earlier...ok, now stay with me on this one; The bands influences are clearly Godflesh, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Nine Inch Nails, Head of David(obviously do to their choice of cover), Loop, Killing Joke, etc.etc.etc. To any person who doesn't know, they are already being exposed to a lot of the pioneers in the Industrial genre and anyone in the know of Industrial music can see where the genre is headed for both the Metal and Industrial genres. Keyboardist Rhys Fulber on board providing keyboards and enhancing the Industrial tone, and again a total Catch-22 situation having FF influencing FLA, the teaming of two extremes altered the future. Think about it. Does anything industrial post 1993-1995 sound anything like before? Absolutely not. Most bands left the stark bleakness and depressive misanthropy behind. Skinny Puppy came down off their cocain high, Swans went more melodic/ambient. FLA started dabbling in wimpy dance Electronic crap and even tried introducing guitars. Ministry started sucking. And Godflesh started to become more boring. Fear Factory to the best of what was and put it to a level of agression hat even the founders of the Industrial genre couldn't match in comparison(except for Killing Joke). Even Metal suffered the same fate. Just how many bands these days are using triggered drums? How many bands are using the same start/stop palm-muted riffs mixed with machine gun-like double bass? And don't even get me started on how Fear Factory beat every single band to the shout verses and clean choruses by at least 10 years. Point being...Fear Factory may have set everyone back for at least the next 50 years.\n\nThe songs don't stop coming. Oh Allah have mercy on us all, the songs don't fucking stop at all. The opening title track \"Demanufacture\" sums everything up on the album. In fact it's obvious that the album is the standard man v.s. machine concept; A society crumbling apart and on a downward spiral into violence, hatred and corruption. Burton's lyrics are so fucking anti-establishment and hate-filled it sounds like he's suffering from a bad case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. But considering the band lived in Los Angeles in the early nineties and were prone to experience the riots, lootings, gang wars, drive-by shootings, earthquakes, and everything else that would make a regular person snap and go postal like Michael Douglas in \"Falling Down\", it's not too surprising that his lyrics are the every-day soundtrack to someone who is fucking fed-up with everything and wants the bullshit to stop. Burton C. Bell even goes into the person's failing faith in a god that is supposed to provide some answers to his cry out for help in songs like \"Zero Signal\" where is shows that this miserable bastard is suffering not only externally but internally as well. The tear-inducing \"Piss Christ\" follows the same dealings with the absence and questioning of the the almighty which provides us with notion that maybe we just made the biblical messiah up for the hell on Earth that we create. The album ends with the person can no longer stand against it all and must accept defeat and failure (A Therapy For Pain) and longs for death because it's the only peace the album's character will ever experience.\n\nI could go on and on on how great and genre-defying this album is, but then again I couldn't because it would sound like I'm repeating or others whom have reviewed this album, but fortunately for Fear Factory, no other album has come close to the level of agression and unfortunately for themselves they haven't either. \"Demanufacture\" is a glimpse into a violent future. \n\nStandout tracks:\n1.

        "\nFear Factory\u2019s sophomore effort \u201eDemanufacture\u201cis one of those albums that split the industrial fan base in two. There are those who praise it to the high heavens for being an album that \u201cpushed the boundaries of industrial metal\u201d and those who call it \u201cthe first misstep in a series of failures\u201d. Both opinions don\u2019t really match mine. \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d was a lot more unconventional when it came out three years earlier, yet on the other side, \u201cDemanufacture\u201d is definitely not a \u201csell-out\u201d, as the band is still instantly recognizable and clearly able to write coherent songs. \n\nLet\u2019s give this album a closer look; production-wise it sounds a lot cleaner, more polished and just overall more professional than its predecessor, without loosing the razor-edge guitar sound of earlier times. The technical proficiency of the band members has risen quite tremendously, therefore allowing them to put the emphasis on more machine-esque songwriting (precise rhythm sections, machine gun-drumming, etc.) which has become the trademark sound of this band up to this day.\n\nThe compositions seem to be simpler than before, but only at first glance; \u201cSoul of a New Machine\u201d had lots of songs with few riffs in them. But their shortness made them sound more diverse than they actually were. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, this band never was about \u201chow many riffs can I stuff into a one minute song?\u201d and that\u2019s why this can\u2019t be considered a riff-fest from beginning to end. If you want that, industrial metal might just not be your thing. \n\nSpeaking of which, the amount of electronic experiments has risen as well (the Godflesh and Ministry influences are definitely audible), which makes \u201cDemanufacture\u201d sound less one-dimensional than the album before it. Diversity is not lacking here, as the songs can be distinguished from each other easily.\n\nBell\u2019s clean voice appears a lot more regularly and has clearly gotten better with experience. He\u2019s one of the reasons why this album always retains its catchiness \u2013 especially in the choruses (Replica is probably the best example for a heavy, but accessible song). His harsh vocal-style has definitely lightened up a little, as it\u2019s not nearly as guttural as it\u2019s been in the past; quite a downer for some, including me, as his voice techniques here remind one of 90s hardcore more than anything else. Calling \u201cDemanufacture\u201d industrial death metal is an oxymoron anyway as the death metal influences are kept to a minimum over its whole duration. \n\nI guess there isn\u2019t much left that hasn\u2019t been said about this album. It\u2019s just a catchy and quite entertaining industrial metal album for those craving for a short blast of simple and undemanding brutality once in a while. Only recommended in full to those who can live with an album that becomes somewhat stale when being consumed regularly. To those who can\u2019t, just download \u201cZero Signal\u201d, \u201cReplica\u201d and \u201cPisschrist\u201d and you\u2019re set.\n",
        "\nAfter gracing us with a couple of demo tapes Fear Factory gave us the release that would kick-start their career. With the release of Soul of a New Machine they began a legacy of ever progressing style that started as just another death metal band. The industrial element of this first full length release was kept to a minimum, but present throughout. The overall sound of this album is raw. The guitars sound to me a bit like the overall feel of Left Hand Path by Entombed. The styles aren\u2019t the same at all, just the recorded sound. The death metal elements are a dead on match for the genre in the early nineties. \n\nThe album starts out with Martyr, an excellent track in my opinion. There is heavy riffing to bring the album to full steam immediately. Then, sustain is utilized on one note with the high hat to set the beat. Then the spoken words and drum set up the tension. The heavy riff kicks back in and sets you headbanging about your room. The song follows this loosely as a pattern until the finish. Nothing technical or brutal, just death metal, with clean vocals added in for the industrial feel.\n\nCrash Test begins with a grating industrial tinged scraping noise. Some shouting is added into the background as the song surges into a thrashing frenzy. It is a bit repetitive I admit, but halfway through the songs kicks into another equally heavy riff and the tempo is slowed. A bridge ensues and we can take a moment to breathe, and then you\u2019re plummeted straight back into the first riffing. The song is simple in comparison to much other death metal, but there is no denying the urge to get up and move. The lyrics themselves are interesting in the fact that they are about animal testing. The death shout instead of a death growl serve this song well and add to its intensity.\n\nThe track Natividad is a break from the metal and a cool approach to the industrial side of the band. The track consists of what sounds like large machinery in a factory. If you listen hard enough you may find a pattern to the jumble of sounds. You might also find yourself imagining that you are witnessing the machines doing their work. This track helped the lay the foundations of the industrial side of Fear Factory\u2019s brand of metal.\n\nThe song Suffer Age starts with a high guitar piece tightening up the coils of the track. The bass and drums are added in and a sense of impending chaos becomes more obvious. The intro is greeted with clean vocals in the background. Now the pressure builds as some riffs are introduced while dueling between the guitars and drums. The song then explodes into its death metal glory. The snare beats and the vocals dominate while the guitars tear up the background. A sample is thrown in and the tempo changes without losing momentum. After a short bridge the song kicks back into the death metal sound. Ending abruptly as it started I can only imagine how much fun the pit was when they played this track live.\n\nDesecrate begins with a short battle of riffs between guitar and bass. They join forces and plunge you into a fast and heavy song. The vocals are still the death shout as the rest of the album, however have an added effect worthy of the Fear Factory name. The song then move itself into a more groove oriented, but still heavy as hell section. This alternation takes place twice before a new riff is brought into the mix. The chord progressions are heavy for the whole track no matter where they are played on the fretboard. The riffage continues for a few more quick cycles and then finish abruptly.\n\nI\u2019ve only chosen a few songs, but this is the overall feel for the album. The standard slow and heavy lines are present in most songs. Likewise, the fast mosh oriented progressions are present throughout the whole album. The production quality is pretty high for a band of this nature from this era. If you are looking for a slightly different take on early nineties death metal I recommend picking up this album. Their death metal edge fades away as time passes, but this jewel lives on.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m not exactly at the forefront when it comes to the negative consequences of project MK-ULTRA, but I\u2019d venture to guess that this pile of sonic drivel was somehow connected to one or two of them. That\u2019s the only logical explanation for a band taking an already boring and redundant Machine Head meets Pantera groove metal album in \u201cDemanufacture\u201d and turning it into a 64 minute long bad LSD trip at a 2AM rave party. Either that, or Dino Cazares and company essentially predicted the rise of the \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d movie character otherwise known as The Shermanator, 2 years before the movie came out no less, and emulated his personality through the musical medium. If that\u2019s the case, maybe the makers of this also feel sorry for it enough that they\u2019ll decided to give it the hot Czechoslovakian chick in the sequel, but no such thing will happen if it\u2018s up to me.\n\nIf Type O Negative are going to be the subject of ridicule for the endless streams of remixes of their songs located on various single b-sides, it should be noted that said band never succeeded in stripping the metal edge from any of their songs. By contrast, Fear Factory have all but completely phased the guitar out of existence, save a few sparse entries spread out at key points within this sea of studio gimmicks and computer sounds. Whatever riffs are able to be located in this musical game of \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo\u201d are usually either two note idea farts comparable to what can be heard on \u201cRoots\u201d or slowed down chugging lines that were probably lifted off of \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d. But what this lacks in guitar sound it more than makes up for with goofy electronic drum sounds and over-processed vocals. If this isn\u2019t enough to make you break out your glow-in-the-dark lip gloss and hair coloring, all of the Ecstasy in the world won\u2019t help you dude.\n\nBetween all the cybernetic Dadaism and droning boredom a very clear pattern emerges, endless repetition without any interesting ideas to drift off into dream world with. Sectional changes, though at times abrupt, are as mechanical as the clanks and auditory zigzags that can only function to the detriment of a listener\u2019s IQ level. Plainness becomes even more apparent in the percussion work, which contains enough straight beats to make AC/DC\u2019S entire back catalog seem gay in comparison (pun intended). \u201cCloning Technology\u201d and \u201cGenetic Blueprint\u201d are grade A examples of hypnotic songs with redundant drum beats played by a machine since their too damn boring for most human drummers to stand playing for 5 minutes plus. Then of course there is the purposeless 30 second caprice \u201cBionic Chronic\u201d. Going to the rave and only packing weed guys? You pussies!\n\nBut my own facetiousness aside, my reaction begs the question as to how I came into possession of this sordid abomination. Truth be told, I got it out of a discount bin at an FYE in Baltimore about 6 years ago for $4, and I still feel cheated. When I measure it against all of the various Cds I\u2019ve encountered mocking the good name of heavy metal, it\u2019s pretty close to the bottom of the barrel. But one positive side of the album is that it doesn\u2019t try to pretend to be a metal album, which is more than I can say for \u201cRoots\u201d or \u201cThe Burning Red\u201d. If you want to hear a solid mix of industrial music and metal out of these guys, check out either \u201cSoul Of A New Machine\u201d or \u201cArchetype\u201d, and leave this crap to people who are too tripped out to tell the difference between the rave hipsters they\u2019re partying with and the purple demons their bad score dredged up from their subconscious.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 26, 2009.\n",
        "\nWell, first of all I must say that Fear Factory always was one of my favorite bands. Since the very first time I heard \"Demanufacture\", back in the mid-90's, I loved their own approach to metal and instantly became a fan of their music. As a matter of fact, I really enjoyed each and every album that the Los Angeles based quartet had released up to the infamous \"Digimortal\" (a quite shitty release, to say the least), which marked the beginning of all the controversy with Dino Cazares and such. You all know the history, I think.\n\nThat being said, I was really eager for listening their highly-anticipated comeback with \"Archetype\". I had a lot of expectations deposited on this record, since all the rumours were suggesting that style-wise it was going to be in the vein of \"Demanufacture\". And, gladly enough, for the first six tracks I can assure that it is.\n\nIn fact, the classic trademark sound of the old Fear Factory (lots of double bass, aggresive vocals, catchy choruses... even some blastbeats here and there) shines through the first half of the album like it never did for years. I guess you can say its some \"back to the roots\" kind of thing or whatever. Songs like \"Slave Labor\", \"Drones\", or specially, \"Cyberwaste\", bring us the Fear Factory formula at its best: heavy and powerful, yet melodic and groovy tunes with a futuristic edge. This first half of the album could be easy labelled as \"Demanufacture Part. 2\" and its amazing... while it lasts.\n\nUnfortunately, the remaining half (with the honourable exception of \"Bonescraper\", which is great also) is nothing but a filler. At least to my ears. And it's a big fuck-up, because \"Archetype\", seen as a whole, is ruined to a great extent by these less inspired and dull songs. Namely, \"Bite the hand that bleeds\", \"Undercurrent\", \"Default Judgement\" and \"Human Shields\" not only sound softer, but also look like b-sides in comparison to the first songs. As far as \"Ascension\" is concerned, this is a needless keyboard-driven instrumental track whose listening is just a waste of time. And \"School\"... oh, well, that's a cover from Nirvana and it sucks big time. As simple as that. \n\nBut lets get back to the positive aspects of the album, shall we? Regarding this subject it is worth mentioning that the production is awesome. Rather than aiming for an ultra-clean, almost artificial sound (just like their previous releases), \"Archetype\" is granted with a slightly touch of rawness which perfectly fits to the music. Thus, every instrument sounds great but also very natural. This is specially noticeable in the drums, less triggered and consequently more organic. By the way, the performance of Raymond Herrera on this recording is probably his best so far. The thing is that besides his foot work (impressive as always), Mr. Herrera adds an unexpected, but welcomed, wide range of rolls and fills to his drum patterns. \n\nTo sum up, \"Archetype\" could be a killer release but it has ended up being just an average album. There's no doubt that its overall rating could be much higher if some songs were removed from the final tracklist. Even then, it is interesting to a certain point and it is worth a listen, even if it is only for the first 26 minutes.\n",
        "\nAh, Fear Factory. The first stepping stone for many a metalhead into the depths of the underground. The nostalgic representation of a metal fan, as he spins Demanufacture or Obsolete and takes his mind back to the days of just discovering the weird and wonderful world of extreme metal. To many reading this, Fear Factory would fall into the echelon of nostalgia \u2013 not that this is a bad group to be lumped in, to be truthful, because it\u2019s the kind of band that you can go back to every once in a while and get caught in the industrial-esque delights this band can conjure, and you can reminisce.\n\nAs much as all that is truthful (at least, to me), one album that you can\u2019t do such a thing is their overlooked debut Soul Of A New Machine. This is what Fear Factory were before they turned into the plodding, industrial machine they are today (whether or not you figure Transgression fits that mould is discussion for another time). This is them raw; stripped of any direction or path, and just pumping out what they knew, and loving it. Despite their other albums having structure, this one has pure feeling, which makes this album stand out amongst their long history\u2026not just because it\u2019s stylistically separate, but because you can feel the air-thumping aggression within every note, every hit and every vocal line. I wouldn\u2019t say that their subsequent albums are inferior without the bare-boned power on display here, but if you could imagine Obsolete with Soul Of A New Machine\u2019s production values, then that would\u2019ve been one bitching album.\n\nWhat makes Fear Factory the band that they are would be the vocal deliveries of Burton C. Bell. His mixture of harsh growls (probably the deepest of his career here, as he later went on to use more of a harsh scream) and cleans are vintage Fear Factory, and he implemented that duel style from the very beginning. On paper, something like that wouldn\u2019t work when dealing with such powerful music, but one listen to tracks such as \u201cBig God/Raped Souls\u201d will change your mind. You hear the cleans, but there is no opportunity to say, \u201cwell, that didn\u2019t quite work.\u201d Everywhere they\u2019re used, it doesn\u2019t sound forced or off at any stage, which can only be a bonus. Of course, being the outlier album it is, tracks such as \u201cCrash Test\u201d use growls exclusively, so there\u2019s a good ratio of both styles.\n\nThe music itself, while quite punishing, is a bit of a mixed bag. On the plus side, Dino could write some really good riffs. The opening to \u201cLeechmaster\u201d is a good example, as the chugging sections lead well into the vocals. This is but one example of a plethora of great riffs scattered throughout. However, when you only have good riffs \u201cscattered\u201d throughout an album that spans for 17 tracks, there\u2019s bound to be a lot of filler and repetitiveness in there. While the so-called filler isn\u2019t at all bad, it can make the impatient listener stop the album before its completion. Particularly the second half of the album, the songs can seemingly blend into one another, because you can feel like you\u2019ve heard it all before in the first half dozen tracks. \u201cDesecrate\u201d in particular, for me, feels like another song. While this is true, like I said, it\u2019s not bad, and for the curious listener, you can find some treasure in amongst the seaweed (1:20 on \u201cW.O.E\u201d). Raymond was already a master at his kit, as shown everywhere here. His playing is not as tight as it was later on (thanks to the lack of Pro-Tools and the 90\u2019s production, more than likely), he completely dominates his drums here to create a pounding percussion monster. Nothing about his playing is truly memorable, but rest assured that none of his playing is redundant, either.\n\nThe industrial elements that are used at the forefront later on are more subtle in Soul Of A New Machine. \u201cNatividad\u201d, while not a proper song, contains the most industrial work, even if it is just objects being thrown around. The intro to \u201cCrash Test\u201d is something different, too. Other industrial sections are in the form of speech. I mean, I dare you not to repeat the line in \u201cCrisis\u201d: This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve made it known that not everything about Soul Of A New Machine is perfect, it\u2019s the very same imperfections that make it the album it is. When you\u2019re in a nostalgic mood, chucking this album on would be low on your pile, but make sure it\u2019s not discarded entirely. This is raw Fear Factory. This is awesome.\n\nBest tracks: Martyr, Crisis, Crash Test, Self Immolation\n",
        "\n\u201cThe light that burns twice as bright burns for half as long.\u201d - Eldon Tyrell\n\nIn case you were wondering, the aforementioned quote is from Blade Runner, arguably the most acclaimed science fiction film of all time. Set in the post-apocalyptic Los Angeles of 2019, the film depicts the decadence of western society into an inhumane, industrial waste land full of darkness, acid rain and decay. Now, you\u2019re also probably wondering what the hell this has to do with Fear Factory\u2019s debut album Soul of a New Machine, so let me try and explain. Like the city of Los Angeles in Blade Runner, Soul of a New Machine is a harsh, technology dominated realm; a death metal machine infused with various industrial and electronic elements. Such a unique fusion of raw, inhospitable death metal with industrial and electronic subtlety was completely unprecedented at the time, and still to this very day, few have been able to match the machine. \n\nWith its cold, calculated gears all meshing together for just under an hour, Soul of a New Machine has a lot to offer. From the grating, Godflesh influenced riffing and melodies on \u201cLeechmaster,\u201d to the abrasive, up-tempo chaos of \u201cFlesh Hold,\u201d this album is loaded with many, memorable tracks. However, \u201cFlesh Hold\u201d is more than just an aggressive slab of Napalm Death inspired insanity. It was actually through this track, that I began to draw the similarities between Blade Runner and Soul of a New Machine. Amidst the hammering, double bass and ferocious tremolo picking, is a sample taken from one of the greatest scenes in the film where Roy Batty, a genetically manufactured human being, a machine, demands for more life, \u201cI want more life, fucker.\u201d This is just one of the many samples infused into the machine which really enhance the harsh, mechanical atmosphere of the album. The early 90\u2019s production job also heightens the mechanized, synchronized feel and while the members themselves believe the poor production value didn\u2019t help the sound of the drums, I feel everything fuses together brilliantly. Raymond\u2019s barrages of double bass, hammering grooves and blast beats have been given a real industrialized tone to them as a result of the production as well as the use of drum triggers. Overall, his drumming isn\u2019t that complicated or the most technical and he usually just sticks to playing fairly standard beats and rhythms as well as lots of single stroke double-bass work and fills.\n\nThe duel strains of ruthlessly executed old school death metal and industrial merge together perfectly in \u201cScumgrief,\u201d my personal favourite track. The song opens with a crushing chord progression injected with short, intense bursts of double kick and tremolo picking. Natural and pinch harmonics are later added to the mix giving the song a refreshing melodic touch, which are layered together with Dino\u2019s scathing guitar work. \u201cScumgrief\u201d also displays excellent dynamic variation both instrumentally and vocally, with Burton alternating between aggressive, raspy grunts and growls and softer, clean vocal passages. His clean vocals, despite becoming a little repetitive at times are executed really, really well; I can\u2019t stress that enough. Tracks like \u201cMartyr,\u201d \u201cScapegoat,\u201d \u201cLifeblind,\u201d and \u201cBig God/Raped Souls\u201d achieve a well-balanced mix between Bell\u2019s twin vocal abilities and add an energizing burst of melody to their harsh, industrialized soundscape. \u201cCrash Test\u201d has also been given an intense melodic flare with long, harmonized tremolo picking sections followed by a crushing, half-time groove. This is one of the few, more memorable riffs found throughout the album as I find it is the songs as a whole that stand out rather than individual sections. \n\nAnother stand out is \u201cW.O.E.\u201d another brutal, grindcore influenced track characterized by the opening section of eerie, discordant guitar leads, raw, extreme tempo grinding and another sample. The song is structured solidly and features various shifts in tempo and time signature as well as excellent guitar work. Dino shows great variation between haunting leads, brutal palm-muted chugging and vicious tremolo picking onslaughts and is one of his strongest performances on the album. These traits are found throughout most songs as well as brutal, heavily distorted bass lines also provided by Dino, which give songs like \u201cCrisis\u201d and \u201cSuffer Age\u201d a massive crunch to them. \n\nDespite becoming a bit repetitious at times and being a bit long-winded in length, Soul of a New Machine is overall, a truly excellent album. This is Fear Factory at their most raw and ruthless; this is the machine when all its gears and pistons synchronized together perfectly; this is when, they were \u201cburning twice as bright.\u201d\n",
        "\nFear Factory\u2019s second album is pure boring. It\u2019s more industrial metal meeting their sci-fi and hate lyric theme while Burton Bell is screaming at the top of his lungs for every song. And listening to it all wears you out!\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not so terrible that it is almost impossible to listen to. It\u2019s just that the way it\u2019s put together with the vocals and over the top bass mixed with lame ass guitar makes it tiresome to listen to. And the drumming, it sounds the same on almost every song. It\u2019s like he is playing the same song over and over while new vocals and guitar goes over it. To sum what I just said up, if you hear anyone of the songs on the album, expect to hear it ten more times if you buy the album. \n\nNow because of how all eleven songs sound the same, you will get very bored listening to the entire album in one sitting. The guitarist does nothing but power cords. And that means no riffs. And to make things worse, the power cords are played on what sounds like only two of the strings.\n\nThe vocals\u2026I hate the vocals. Burton Bell is not a good vocalist. He is mediocre at best. His mediocre mallcore like screams bring out an \u201cI\u2019m 16 and I\u2019m angry at my father,\u201d vibe. This is very bad when it comes to singing in a metal band. \n\nTo sum this entire album up, BORING! Every song is the exact same in vocals, guitar, bass, and drums. The only people I can see buying this album are the die hard Fear Factory fans. And they might not even like it that much. If you hear one song on this album, that is the entire album. This album is a pass.\n",
        "\nI dig this album a lot, though whether that enjoyment hinges more on musical quality or on nostalgia to when I was first getting into metal is anyone's guess. To deny the obvious and pervasive nu-metal leanings of the material here is essentially impossible, but equally impossible is to deny some of the purely excellent songwriting that is indeed present. Well, excellent as far as pop music goes; by this point, Fear Factory had left essentially all vestiges of death metal behind apart from the barest of aesthetics, and was clearly leaning towards a much more mainstream direction. If you can get past that, though, you can find a core of great songwriting, which is not only accessible, but also surprisingly deep and a worthwhile listen for even the more jaded metal listeners among us.\n\nWeirdly enough, I feel that the most ignorant and lame songs on 'Obsolete' are those that stubbornly cling to the 'Demanufacture'-era sound instead of just abandoning that. 'Shock' is a clumsy attempt at an aggressive opener, and it's hard to enjoy beyond a sort of 'WHOA THIS IS HEAVY' adolescent fervor. But it's for that same reason that I can still enjoy 'Edgecrusher', with it's ridiculous tough-guy lyrics and silly hip-hop influence: instead of masquerading as death metal, it finds that big, stupid delight in the new sound and delves fully into it, resulting in what's possibly the ultimate metal 'guilty pleasure'. The title track is similar to 'Shock' in clumsiness, but that's about as far as the particularly offensive tracks go; the rest range from a tad mediocre ('Hi-Tech Hate') to really excellent ('Descent'), and unsurprisingly, the most fundamentally pop-leaning are the best on here.\n\nThe trio of ballads- 'Descent', 'Resurrection', and 'Timelessness'- are legitimately great songs that stand as some of the best that Fear Factory ever turned out. Burton C. Bell's clean vocals are used to amazing effect on these tracks, and are woven into the fabric of the music much better than on previous releases. 'Descent' and 'Resurrection' are the obvious standouts, with anthemic choruses and mammoth riffs, but closer 'Timelessness' is a more subtle beast, devoid of percussion and relying on pure, keyboard-soaked melody. It works. Each of this trio is a great example of what stereotypically progressive influences can do FOR an album instead of TO it, and, open mind provided, could likely convince a lot of people that the inclusion of poppy melodies, keyboards, and (to some degree) uplifting things can, in fact, be used to the benefit of extreme metal.\n\nOn the more genuinely underground side of things, there's two more standouts: 'Smasher/Devourer' and 'Securitron (Police State 2000)' are particularly of note, with sets of great riffs and memorable song structures in each. Admittedly, a great deal for my admiration for them comes from the past: they were some of the first extreme metal songs I'd ever heard. I have to say, though, that they're still great in their own right, even if they are a very poppy and accessible version of extreme metal. Even in their earliest, heaviest days, Fear Factory was never lacking in catchiness, and in this regard, I can't really accuse them of selling out as much as resorting their priorities in songwriting. Is 'Obsolete' essentially a pop album? Yeah, I'd say that's a fair assessment. However, it is a pop album geared to a metalhead crowd, and it does succeed in the attempt of crafting such a release. Plus, you have to give them credit for attempting such an ambitious concept and pulling it off so well; clearly a lot of time and energy was put into it.\n\nI feel about this album the way many people probably feel about, say, 'God Hates Us All'. I still like it, even though my tastes have 'advanced' past it in a lot of ways. It's a disc that I like to bring out occasionally to remind myself of that feeling of discovery when I was first getting into metal. It makes me happy to hear; transports me back to being eleven or twelve years old, furtively downloading Meshuggah MP3s off Kazaa nonstop and always sharing what new musical discovery I'd stumbled upon with my friends. Such a view is a bad way to critique music. It's a great way to experience it, though.\n",
        "\nThe most notable things about Fear Factory's first album are that it is a full-fledged death metal album, that it has industrial and electronic influences far ahead of its time, and that it's clearly heavily influenced by early grindcore and doom bands. It's very dated, but I'd say still worth listening to. But it is dated. That dating is earmarked by a lot of things; most obviously the early '90s production (though it has a colder, more mechanical feel than most), the somewhat clumsy song structures, particularly when attempting to add more experimental elements, and the somewhat strange shoehorning of samples into the album's whole. There's a lot of content here to uncover: seventeen tracks, nearly an hour total; but it is, again, something worth uncovering, even though it does have its weaker moments.\n\nEven at this stage of their career, Fear Factory was a heavily melodic band. Many of the tracks here feature (very good) clean vocals, and there are numerous breaks full of melodic riffs and electronic effects. 'Soul Of A New Machine', at times, sounds more like an industrial album than a death metal album; there's a huge amount of layering and careful crafting in these songs. Where other death metal bands were content to essentially hit record and put songs together, Fear Factory saw a song as an opportunity to express something very multi-layered, and they wasted no moment in adding as many effects and ideas as possible to each. The result is a little mixed; about a quarter of the tracks are forgettable, where the rest half wander between good to classic. But hey, it was a real experiment in a time in death metal where the genre was just really starting to find itself, so you can forgive some flaws when a band is as ambitious as this. The fact that even half the material is still so good is a damn nice ratio to maintain after sixteen years.\n\nIt's a good thing that they managed to get things put together so well, because this album is really much more than the sum of its parts. This is not a release with many memorable riffs or vocal passages (apart from the clean refrains). It's an album that depends on structure and interaction between elements to carry it when the elements on their own are pretty average. It's for this reason that the most conventional death metal tracks tend to be some of the weakest; the last few tracks in particular seem to be where the band ran out of industrial ideas and just went for the death metal jugular, and they kind of fail. Other, more melodic tracks are rousing successes though. 'Leechmaster' is probably one of the best combinations of brutality and Godflesh-inspired melody, executed through riffing instead of clean vocals, surprisingly enough. Speaking of those cleans, the band knew what they were doing; they just start to become a bit overused when 'Scumgrief' incorporates them yet again, when they throw a curveball with industrial noise track 'Natividad' and majestically crushing CLASSIC 'Big God/Raped Souls' and its martial drumming and heavenly clean vocal accompaniment.\n\n'Arise Above Oppression' shows just how influenced the band was by Napalm Death; Burton C. Bell seems to be doing his best Barney Greenway impression, and the overall feel is that of an industrialized Napalm Death track. There's a bunch of other really good tracks on the album; 'Self Immolation' has awesome drumming and effects, 'W.O.E.' is a great, brutal track, and 'Flesh Hold' is pretty instantly recognizable due to its outro sample. The album really does manage to keep coming up with something new just when you think they're all out of ideas. The playing from every member is pretty awesome, with a special emphasis on Raymond Herrera, who's pretty goddamn amazing throughout. He'd only been playing drums for two years when he recorded this album, and he's an absolute monster with those tight industrial rhythms as well as blasts and double bass.\n\n'Soul Of A New Machine' is still a really great album. It's a bit unwieldy with its length; the last three tracks could have been cut off with no trouble; but all in all, it's remarkable how well its stood up. You can NEVER confuse this with something coming out recently; there's too many awkward, unsure moments, evidencing itself as a release from when everything here was a very unique and progressive thing. While the latter may no longer be true, the former may be; I've never heard another industrial metal band with an album that sounds like the perfect soundtrack to the 'real Earth' landscapes of 'The Matrix'. Beautifully atmospheric, powerful, and brutal; it has everything that is necessary to have true staying power in heavy metal scene. I still love it, even after years of plays.\n",
        "\nFear Factory's \"Archetype\", their first album since the departure of Dino Cazares, features much of the band's traditional fury - directed, as per normal, at the wider society. A few songs here are clearly directed at record companies (\"Slave Labor\" and \"Corporate Cloning\"), which is perhaps only to be expected given the band's split from their label at roughly the same time as this album was recorded.\n\nThe hallmarks of Fear Factory's sound are well and truly present here. Burton Bell's roared vocals, a massive wall of guitars and frantic drumming - which is achieved through triggering, but even that realisation doesn't dull the impact of the whole package. That distinctively quasi-industrial precision of sound is also here, which shouldn't really surprise anyone given that this is a band whov'e always been interested in the relationship between man and machine. From the moment that \"Slave Labor\" starts, the album leaps out of the gates and really doesn't let up on the pace until around the 11th track, the mellow \"Human Shields\". Well, perhaps \"mellow\" isn't quite the right word, since the volume is still well and truly turned up on all the instruments - it's just that the band seems slightly more reflective here than at any other point on the album.\n\n\"Human Shields\" is in fact followed by \"Ascension\", a 7-minute synth-based piece which is practically ambient music, although Burton's voice (repeating a phrase from the previous track) floats in and out of the mix a little bit. It's an unusual detour on an album which is generally all about sheer destructive volume. The onslaught is re-started immediately afterwards with \"School\", but I feel that the momentum is a bit lost as a result of the synth track.\n\nThe one weakness of the album, and it's a weakness which I've found is the case over most of Fear Factory's career, is that over the course of the album the rage gets a bit blurred. Yes, each and every track is superbly furious by itself, but many of them seem almost interchangeable over nearly an hour. Taken individually, however, these are all (with the exception of \"Ascension\", which is a different case entirely) tracks which can stand up for themselves. It's just that listening to them one after the other shows up their lack of differentiation.\n\nStill, as a Fear Factory album, this is a prime example of the band's sound and well worth a listen.\n",
        "\nDeathy grindings and epic riffage meet sci-fi techno wizardry in this masterpiece.\n\nThe title of industrial metal king is hotly contested, and with Nine Inch Nails \"The Downwards Spiral\", Marylin Manson \"Antichrist Superstar\", Ministry \"Psalm 63\" and Rammstein \"Mutter\" battling for the techno-metal crown, it won't be an arguement that'll die down soon. However, as far as I'm concerned, the genre reached it's apex with Fear Factory's revered \"Demanufacture\". Here was an album that did the techno, and the metal, to perfection, balancing them wonderfully, while bringing each to the fore when it suits them. Which can only be a good thing considering that this was made while others were simply doing dance music with guitars and the occasional death roar.\n\nThis was FF's first industrial album, as they were previously a death outfit, but it is handled with such finesse that it puts them up with the masters. They claimed to want to make a \"Futuristic\" metal album, and to that effect they've succeeded. The guitars, courtesy of the now-legendary Dino Cazeras, are huge; they're rich, bassy and epic. They match the electronics perfectly, and the drummer is so good that it was initially thought that FF used a drum machine. The combined sound washes over the listener, leaving you breathless and hungry for more.\n\nThe vocals, however, are something else entirely; the screams are unlike anything even a seasoned metal fan will have heard before. They are oddly hoarse, not as deep as death metal bands, but deeper than most metalcore bands. You can make out what the words are, and the singing is equally unique, so deep, it's hard to decide whether Burton Bell is a good singer or not, but it compliments the guitars perfectly. The album goes at the kind of pace and progression only a concept album can, and each song is an instant classic, particularly \"Replica\" and \"Flashpoint\". A cover of Head Of David \"Dog Day Sunrise\" seems out of place but the appeal grows over time. \n\nHowever, the greatest thing about this album is it's almost cyberpunk feel; with it's drum'n'bass-slash-metal mixture, Dave McKean cover art and man-versus-machine storyline, it's like a music equivalent of \"The Terminator\", \"The Matrix\" or \"Ghost in the shell\". Yes, this marrage of meaty riffs and techno beats still sounds fresh today. This is the closest Industrial music will ever come to a true marriage of beeps and metal.\n\nClever, epic and futuristic, this has survived the 10 years since it's inception and still sounds cutting edge today.\n",
        "\nArchetype is essentially redemption. The word archetype refers to something that is the prime example and the album is damn near close to fitting its title. This album is a complete throwback to the Demanufacture era of Fear Factory \u2013 and right from the kick off of the album, the listener knows this.\n\nFear Factory has had their ups and downs in their career but since their \u201cbreak-up\u201d and the departure of (now ex) guitarist Dino Cazares it seems as if Fear Factory has found renewed vigor and vitality to create some aggressive industrialized death metal music. The line-up has shifted slightly (Wolbers left his previous bass position to play guitar and Stroud has entered the line-up as bass player) but really this album doesn\u2019t feel as though the line-up has changed at all \u2013 and if anything, the band seems to be clicking even better.\n\nThis album hasn\u2019t gone \u201cback to the roots\u201d of Fear Factory, despite what many people love to claim. This is essentially Fear Factory evolving once again towards a more aggressive form of music. It\u2019s not Demanufacture Pt. 2 or anything like that. It has its own identity. The guitar tones are heavy and rhythmic (if they weren\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t be Fear Factory) and Wolbers does an amazing job and sounds even tighter than Cazares did. The rhythms are pounding in the faster songs and the melodies in the slower songs (Bite the Hand That Bleeds is already a classic) are unmistakenably well written.\n\nBut with Wolbers being both a monster on bass earlier and guitar now \u2013 how does the new man in the band hold up? Pretty fucking well \u2013 is my answer. The bass is deep and threatening and undertones the album just perfectly to make Fear Factory really shake the walls. He proved himself to be good in Strapping Young Lad and I have nothing but praise for him now in Fear Factory. \n\nDrumming has always been one of Fear Factory\u2019s strongest suits and Archetype doesn\u2019t let the fans down. With double bass parts that put some black metal to shame and cymbal work that puts some progressive metal to shame \u2013 this album has most of everything. \u201cCyberwaste\u201d is a great example of his work on this album. What\u2019s really strange about this album though is that the drumming doesn\u2019t stand out quite as much as it previously did. The music is written so that each individual part fits nicely together and doesn\u2019t overpower anything.\n\nBurton C. Bell is impressive. He is on top with this album. He doesn\u2019t use a lot of synthetic elements on his voice \u2013 although there is some towards the latter part of the album. He really hits his high register at the end of the album (Ascension has some amazing vocal melodies) and even in the beginning of the album, when he does most of his death metal work \u2013 he really keeps the music from getting too heavy and keeping it slightly melodic. The industrial keys and samples help with giving the album a good variety but it\u2019s really Burton\u2019s job to do that. And he does it well.\n\nThe one strange complaint I have about Archetype (which I read isn\u2019t on all versions of the album) is the very unusual inclusion of a Nirvana bonus track. Fear Factory very much made the song their own \u2013 but with all bonus tracks it feels very out of place with an epic song like \u201cAscension\u201d ending the album. The album has good flow and then that cover just kind of spoils it. (I usually just skip it).\n\nFear Factory has redeemed themselves from their last album. Archetype is amazing from start to finish (even though the latter half of the album is a little repetitive and not quite as good as the first half). The new rearranged line-up is hitting their marks and the band hasn\u2019t sounded this good in a long time.\n\nSongs to check out: Cyberwaste, Archetype, Bite the Hand That Bleeds.\n",
        "\nFear Factory has been a heavy metal force to reckon with for many years. They established themselves with Demanufacture, deterred with Digimortal, and redeemed themselves with Archetype. How does a band continue on after doing all that? It\u2019s time for Transgression.\n\nThe title of the album says it all. This isn\u2019t the perfect Fear Factory album. Nor is it a massive change in sound. It\u2019s a slight evolution of the Fear Factory sound. It pushes the boundaries of what we all know to be FF without losing the integrity they fought so hard to bring back.\n\nTransgression is still industrialized death metal. The guitars are rhythmatic and crushing with the riffs. This is one of the major differences within Transgression. With Wolbers on guitars now, rather than bass which he played previous to the departure of Dino there is some experimentation going on. There are leads present at various places on Transgression. Leads are something that Fear Factory HASN\u2019T been known for \u2013 but even though the leads are nothing too impressive \u2013 it is nice to hear some variation in the music. The patented guitar/double-bass drum combo is still present and a massive force to be reckoned with. \n\nRaymond (drums) is spectacular as always on Transgression. His double bass work is something of gods and his use of cymbals and toms gives the album good variety and structure. Bass is powerful and well placed to the front and carries a lot of the rhythm on this album now that the guitars are doing a little lead work.\n\nThe flow of the album is a little better than Archetype (even if some of the catchier songs suffer for this) except for the random cover songs that are present. They really throw off the structure of the album and take up space that could have been used for amazing bonus tracks like \u201cMy Grave,\u201d or \u201cEmpire\u201d to make the first cut. What the hell Fear Factory were doing including a U2 cover is beyond me \u2013 not that it\u2019s a bad cover\u2026its pretty decent but it really feels out of place.\n\nBurton C. Bell has one of the most impressive ranges for metal vocalist I have ever heard. He doesn\u2019t go his highest or his most guttural on Transgression \u2013 but he does do his variations of soaring notes and barking vocals on this album. He tends to spend a lot of time in his higher range this album \u2013 something to help meld with the leads I would think \u2013 so this is going to sound like a possibly \u201csofter\u201d album than normal.\n\nOverall, Fear Factory have produced a semi-solid (if one just skips the two cover songs) album to continue their regeneration of accountability in metal. This album does experiment a little but overall it doesn\u2019t shake the overall Fear Factory sounds. Transgression spells it out exactly.\n\nSongs to check out: Transgression, Moment of Impact, Empire.\n",
        "\nUpon the release of Fear Factory's latest album \"Transgression\", a lot of people were thinking \"Archetype 2\", seeing as it was being released just one year later. Expectations were high, fans were getting restless, and then...\n\n...probably the biggest disappointment ever. Now, I have this album. I'm never getting rid of it. But I do have to say this: By God, this album sucks.\n\nWhen I say it sucks, I don't mean it completely sucks. There are redeeming factors here. For example, the tracks \"Spinal Compression\" and \"Moment Of Impact\" take you back to the good old days where they could be aggressive without being lame. There is nice riffage in these songs, especially on \"Moment Of Impact\" at the beginning. It has impeccable drumming and excellent guitar work.\n\nUnfortunately, they are the best two songs on the album. Some other tracks are not too bad either, until you hit track 6, \"Echo Of My Scream\". At over 6 minutes in length, I have never heard this song all the way through. The guitars are so weak, and the vocals are just awful. They usually do softer songs on their albums, but this is ridiculous. It's so lame. Radio friendly. Boring. It wouldn't feel out of place on a James Blunt album. Need I say more?\n\nSpeaking of weak guitars, that explains the entire album. Where \"Archetype\", \"Obsolete\", and hell, even \"Digimortal\" had crunchy guitars tuned down to give that extra power to the music, it just doesn't do that anywhere here. They sound soft and half-assed with nu-metal riffs, probably with the exception of the last track, \"Moment Of Impact\". Why they decided to go down this direction is beyond me, and hopefully they will have learnt from their mistakes.\n\nThe drumming is still pretty tight and fits well with the music, but again, where's the power? Raymond certainly knows how to play, but that's not enough if the drums sound weak on the CD.\n\nI could talk about the bass and vocals, but I think you know where I'm going with this.\n\nThe whole album is just weak. I can't think of any other words to describe it better. \"Moment Of Impact\" gives us a glimmer of hope that they may still have that talent they exposed earlier in their careers, but, jeez, hopefully their next release won't be so bad. Everyone knows they can do better. Right?\n\nBest tracks: Spinal Compression, Moment Of Impact\n",
        "\n\"Obsolete\" is an intersting peace of industrial material. However, it is neither as good as its predecessor nor as its successor.\n\nThe album is many times lyric-driven. This means two things: 1 - Burton C. Bell sings like a fag many times in this album, and 2 - basic riffing. Maybe Dino Cazares was too lazy this time, I don't know. For the most part of the album, the riffs are desperately basic and far from original and are used only as background. True, Dino and Christian play in perfect harmony, but that is really not that hard when most of the music is Nu Metal.\n\nOther than that, the album is technically good. In the many parts where the drums take the lead, they do excellent work. Sometimes it sounds like they are forced to, as if the drummer felt that if he wouldn't do something the songs will suck ass. Raymond Herrera is one of the best drummers I heard, and he is fast, diverse and sharp on this album. However - he's not heavy. The album lacks the feel of Metal. If you're looking for headbanging you won't find it here. maybe if you look real carefully. \"Shock\" and sometimes \"Obsolete\" are the only exceptions here.\n\n\"Descent\" is totally Nu-Metal and \"Timelessness\" is a semi-A-Capella song, totally boring. I assume it is meant to lyrically complete the story (it is a concept album).\n\nOne aspect must be pointed out: The production of \"Obsolete\", as all of Fear Factory's albums, is flawless. Every instrument is audible in its full sound, the bass is felt well and the drums - oh the drums. Every pound of every drum, cymbal and pedal is felt. The sound is mostly metallic-industrial, yet still possesses some grove. The synthesizer parts which are distantly scattered along the album are always in place, tactfull, and never obscure the other instruments.\n\nEventually, \"Obsolete\" is mostly a Nu-Metal/Metalcore album, with metal drumming here and there. My personal favorites: \"Shock\", \"Edgecrusher\" and \"Obsolete\", which are the only good songs here. True, fear factory make excellent Nu-Metal/Metalcore, but they better leave it to other bands and focus on the real metal they are good at.\n",
        "\n\"Archetype,\" Fear Factory's re-entry into the industry without Cazarres was a smashing success. So, in less than a year, it'd be logical to assume that hot off the excellence of that album, \"Transgression\" would've looked to be a great album as well, right?\n\nSee, this is the part where I think we're being toyed with. How could the same band that wrote \"Archetype,\" \"Demanufacture\" part two, write this atrocity? It was sayed that this album was going to be experimental, but apparently it was a failed one. On a massive fucking level. Fear Factory were a band that was very close to Nu-Metal to begin with, the only thing that stopped them was a Thrashy sound. Well, they tossed that out the fucking window, and here you have nothing but riffs that sound like rejects from a KoRn album. Listening to the opening of \"Contagion.\" Things don't get any better from there, either, as Fear Factory recess into melodic garbage with \"Echo of My Scream.\" It sounds like a radio single.\n\nNearly everything about the band's changed. That cold, mechanic feel of Herrera's drumming has vanished, the guitar has gone from crunchy, thrashy riffs to Nu throwaways. Bell's vocals, one of the defining traits of Fear Factory, nowhere near as over the top and magnificent as on their other albums. The writing style has shifted as well. Instead of holding to those drop tuning and drone string melodies, now it's just... radio-ready. It's the only way to describe it.\n\n\"Transgression\" is a fine example of when progression is a bad thing. What would happen if Krisiun started playing Power Metal? Some bands just need to stick to their guns. Fear Factory stopped and faultered. Hopefully their next album won't be as atrocious.\n",
        "\nNow let's talk about death metal when it used to rule. Case study here: Fear Factory.\n\nThis album pretty much defines early 90's style death metal. This reminds us of the young days of death metal when it was still a growing art. Everything about this album is old school death metal... just a very un-technical and unorthodox style of it.\n\nMany consider Fear Factory as being one of the first death metal bands to incorporate clean vocals into their music as well as random samples and stock footage usage. I can't debate that necessarily, but from what I've heard from other bands, Fear Factory seems to be one of the earlier bands to experiment with death metal. This is what made this band stand out within the death metal community back in the days....\n\nWell, minus the terrible production (those guitars sound so goddamn hollow!), this still stands the test of time as a well composed album. I like to look at it as industrial death metal for it's use of samples and diabolical growls. Some tracks on this CD are essential for listening like the classic \"Scapegoat.\" It really defines how death metal was back in the 90's. Other tracks, like \u201cCrisis\u201d incorporate movie samples and have a huge use of clean vocals that give off this somber industrial feel. If you really want to hear Burton C. Bells sickest growls, turn to \"Escape Confusion...\" those first few growls through the beginning of the song must be some of the most heathen growls he's ever belched. If you would like to hear blast beats, then take a listen to \"Suffer Age\", which is the most intense track on the CD because of it's shift from blast to thrashy beats.\n\nThough there are great tracks on the CD, there are some tracks which don't seem to play in full, at least, on my stereo. Those are not worth mentioning but if you do decide to take a listen to this CD, you'll realize what those tracks are (such as \"Crash Test\" and \"Life Blind.\")\n\nOverall, this is essential for any death metal fan, it\u2019s not the most technical death metal album, but it's definitely worth the money to buy and own. If you're interesting in getting into Fear Factory, then this isn't the best album to first get into. This is not what Fear Factory has been famous for; their next album is best to start with and shows what they will soon evolve into...\n\n\nEar Candy: Martyr, Leechmaster, Scapegoat, Crisis, Scumgrief, Big God/Raped Souls, Suffer Age...\n",
        "\nWow... I must really say that this is impressive! This has to be the best remix album of a metal album around. Many people bashed this album as being some \"money grabber\" or some waste of time making \"techno\" remixes, but it isn't. People cannot realize how hard it is to make remixes of songs, and at that, remixes of metal songs. I love the original Demanufacture songs, but I also love some of these tracks here... it's an interesting look at how a song can be changed and manipulated to be something completely different.\n\nNow for those who say that this is just techno and whatnot... they obviously don't know what they're talking about. This is a blend of, indeed, some techno, but there are also trip-hop remixes, industrial, trance, hardcore (in the raving sense), and even some break beats here and there. So as it is, this is a very diverse remix album with a variety of dance styles and genres. This is unlike Fear Factory's last remix album \"Fear Is The Mindkililer.\" That last remix album was, for the most part, industrial remixes of death metal songs (which ended up being interesting yet funny to hear an industrial beat with growls) and those tracks weren't as manipulated as the tracks on this CD. \n\nTo easily delineate each track, here's a list of how the tracks play out:\n\nRemanufacture (Demanufacture): a techno remix which isn't the best track on the CD, but makes for a good opener on the CD. It's progressive and has multiple changes.\n\nNational Panel Beating (Body Hammer): this is a trip-hop style kind of remix which is one of the better remixes on the album. This is one of the most manipulated songs on the whole CD where the whole song, and even lyrics, are changed up. This is a very \"chill back\" track with it's piano chords playing throughout the music.\n\nGenetic Cloning (New Breed): this is my personal favorite track on the CD. It's a trip-hop/break beat style remix which has the \"nu-metalish\" main guitar riff constantly playing through the track non-stop. It's sure to get you \"noggin'\" your head to the infectious beats... yes, I said infectious, so what?!\n\nFaithless (Zero Signal): this my favorite track off of the Demanufacture album but not on this album. It's a mix between trance/industrial and some break beats. It's a \"soft\" hitter to say the least on the album and it's not as manipulated as the other tracks are; it's just mixed over with some various beats and synths. The lyrics flow through the track as they had in the original song version. It's an intoxicating trip if ya ask me.\n\nBionic Chronic: This is an interlude track... if ya ask me, it's pointless. Skip it...\n\nCloning Technology (Replica): ahhh yes... this is the big hit single off of Demanufacture... and somehow, I never really liked the original song. Even on this album, you'd expect it to be a great remix song (well this CD is also known as \"Cloning Technology\" so you would assume so) but it's not a great remix. Replica has never really been such an energetic song and neither is this trip-hop version of the song, \n\nBurn (Flashpoint): ironically, this remix is much more enjoyable than the original version of this song. This is a techno/breakbeat style remix which is a mid-paced fun track.\n\nT-1000 (H-K): now let's talk heavy... this is the only track on this CD which is a hardcore remix (in the raving sense.) All you hear on this track is a heavy bass drum and the main riff in H-K being played. This is definitely the most energetic track on the whole entire album. If raving is your thing, then this is your track.\n\nMachines Of Hate (Self Bias Resistor): another great track from Demanufacture gets dubbed into a fast techno remix. I'm not much of a big fan of techno but this really gets me listening all the time.\n\n21 Century Jesus (Pisschrist): perhaps the most epic remix on this album is this techno/industrial dubbed track of Pisschrist. It's progressive and ambience which makes for a relaxing listen.\n\nBound For Forgiveness (A Therapy For Pain): the last of the remixes, which is an ambience track with trip-hop and industrial. It's the best way to end a remix album with a long, trippy song.\n\nRefinery: this is the only track on this CD newly composed by Fear Factory, and it's nothing but an echoing sound. Eh... who decided to put this on the CD?!\n\nThe last track is an edit of the Remanufacture track. This is probably the track they decided to use to promote the CD on radio and whatnot. I don't notice much of a difference between this and the other Remanufacture track... well the only difference is that this is a shorter version of the original.\n\nThis is only for the open-minded who are looking to expanding their musical senses out of the metal boundaries. It's as Fear Factory explains this remix album: \"Open minds shall dominate and breed.\" I could've not said it any better than that. This is a great remix album and probably the best one you'll ever find among metal bands. \n\n\nEar Candy: All of the tracks.\n",
        "\nWhat\u2019s a polite way to say that your bands album sucks?\n\nHonestly, when an album is THIS bad, I don\u2019t think there is a way to say it politely. I think you just have to come out, full-force, and say it. So having said this, I will now proceed to say this\u2026\n\nFear Factory, your latest album sucks\u2026\n\nI tried, so desperately tried, to like this album. But when it came down to it, there was no possible way to like what was here. It was totally generic, rehashed to hell, and done by so many other bands. But there is a positive, the music was played well. You can take a bit of solace in that. But as for what nourishment the rest provides us with, it\u2019s quite minimal. It\u2019s like you\u2019re a poor boy, living in a poor neighborhood. Your father works a job at the local factory where he doesn\u2019t make an earnest living. There\u2019s food on your table, and you eat. Then after you\u2019ve eaten, you look at your parents and ask\u2026 \u201cIs that it?\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s about what listening to this album is like. You long and long to find something positive here, but when it all boils down, there\u2019s really nothing there. Just the bare-bones of what once was. \n\nI will admit that I was a fan of this band a few years ago. I intensely enjoyed \u201cArchetype\u201d, \u201cDemanufacture\u201d and even \u201cObsolete\u201d. But this latest musical massacre really turned me away from the band. It\u2019s like they take one step forward and please the fans, but then retrace their steps and follow a different path. Maybe they\u2019re struggling again to find the happy medium that they once had? Who knows? It\u2019s like the harder they try, the bigger they flop. \n\nI\u2019ve heard this album referred to as an \u201cexperimental\u201d album, but I really don\u2019t know. Experimental albums tend to have different elements and experimentation to them. But this was just watered-down mainstream metal that Slipknot and Mudvayne freaks would gobble up in a second. It was quite second-rate compared to the astonishing Archetype \u2013 which honestly had a lot of fans looking twice at this band again. Dare I say it?? Maybe Archetype itself was just a fluke?\n\nNow, loyalists and other newcomers to the metal scene will enjoy this album, I\u2019m sure. What one person thinks is garbage may be beautiful music to someone else. It all depends on one\u2019s preferred listening style. For me, personally, this album fell way short of the expectations that I had. I was almost expecting Archetype Pt II. But I guess that was too much to ask, huh? \n\nSomething else that you can look forward to in this album is the amount of industrial elements that they have become known for using. Over the past number of albums, we\u2019ve seen them evolve into an alternative industrial metal band, which can have its moments, especially for someone who enjoys industrial metal, like me. The use of the drums creates a good sound that is immediately distinguishable as Fear Factory, but even this can\u2019t stop the lack of sustenance in the music. \n\nAfter the first few songs on the album, the direction seems to shift to the worst. It goes from semi-technical, Meshuggah-like riffs, to all out nu-metal garbage. The song that really gets that started is track number 6, Echo Of My Scream. It has to be, quite possibly, one of the worst Fear Factory songs ever made. It\u2019s a very calm song, with not a lot to offer; clean vocals, mellow atmosphere and sub-par music. Nothing special, but it\u2019s the transition to the worst part of the album. The sad thing is, this kind of song has been done over and over by countless nu-metal bands. It\u2019s like the kind of song a nu-metal band would make a video for to get their band noticed. So how can they say it\u2019s experimental when it\u2019s been done many times before?\n\nHowever, some of the songs here aren\u2019t all that bad, especially in the first 4-5 songs. They\u2019re not all that memorable or enjoyable, but definitely listenable. They don\u2019t redeem the album at all. I don\u2019t think there is anyway to redeem this album. Once you get past the first few songs, you\u2019re met with a following of trash that can easily destroy a metal band\u2019s credibility. And we all know that in metal scene that credibility is a big thing. And just when the band seemed to have built up more metal credibility, they release Transgression.\n\nNow, let\u2019s go a little deeper here for a second. \u201cTransgression\u201d basically means going beyond a certain boundary. Maybe we all should\u2019ve taken notice of this and expected the worst when they transgressed from the metal world into the more mainstream world, where the likes of Slipknot dominate. Maybe this was a sign, a premonition even, that this would\u2019ve happened. \n\nI know I\u2019m doing a lot of ragging on this band, comparing them to nu-metal bands. But the truth of the matter is that\u2019s all this album really is. When you look at the components, and the structure of the music, it\u2019s nothing more than nu-metal. I can swear I\u2019ve heard some of these riffs on this album done by other bands. \n\nSo overall, was I pleased with this album? Not even close.\nWould I consider it one of the year\u2019s best? No way. \nWould I consider it one of the year\u2019s worst? Most definitely. While not being the worst, it\u2019s down on the list.\nCan the band recover from this album? Who knows? I guess only time will tell.\n\nBut until that happens, we all have to accept the fact that the band, once again, has moved more towards the mainstream \u2013 like on their Digimortal days. It\u2019s not going to please a lot of people, but it\u2019s happened\u2026 again.\n",
        "\nI was quite excited for this release especially after the 2004 release of Archetype, which was a bit more aggressive than Digimortal and Obsolete as it contained faster tempos and aggressive double bass. Fear Factory was quickly back in the studio recording for this 2005 release \"Transgression\". Never has Fear Factory put out 2 albums in back to back years. It made me wonder if Fear Factory was only concerned about money and corporate America. \n\nWithin Transgression the listener will find tempos which are slower with less a darker presence and thus its more upbeat with plenty of melodic parts. This is the ingredients to \"new metal\", or metal that MTV headbangers ball plays. I am sure Fear Factory will be advertised plenty on MTV, which makes me think that Fear Factory has pretty much followed in the footsteps of Metallica; sellouts and not true to metal. After all isn't metal suppose to be aggressive, raw, and just plain 'darker' sounding? Since when is metal upbeat and happy sounding? Does this mean Green Day is metal too? I don't think so and Fear Factory with this release, has almost gone into the alternative genre. This is a slap in the face of extreme metal and Fear Factory is just not the fierce machine they used to be. It would be quite hard to catorgorize this as 'machine metal'.\n\nThe only reason I gave Fear Factory a higher rating on this release is because I do like alternative music (I also enjoy Enya) and they have some solid songs on here, some are even (at times) very Fear Factoryish, but its not the aggressive Fear Factory of the mid 1990s. I could never listen to this and think \"wow, this is hard'. Their day has past, and it is sad when bands stop progressing (especially in the realm of metal), although they have made a mark on those who want to progress metal, meaning faster tempos, darker themes, technical patterns, seven string guitars, and just tougher sounds! Raymond Herrera displays his trademark of (triggered) double bass patterns on Transgression, but they are not any more techincal than the work he has done the past 10 years. \n\nTherefore, Transgression is sadly just another release from Fear Factory, as they continue to struggle for the mainstream. If you like mainstream metal, you should purchase this CD, for this is the level its on.\n",
        "\nAfter Archetype hit and I was unbelievably pleased at how raw but mature that album was, I was very eager to get my ears wrapped around Transgression. Unfortunately, the album seems to be just that... a transgression. Did Burton know this before entering said 'acclaimed' studio, or was it a result of the studio? I do not know.\n\nAll in all, firing the disk up, the opening track \"540.000 Degrees Fahrenheit\" is exactly what I hoped to hear, a natural progression of FF's sound. Good and hard with that industrial sound, with a hint of something \"-core\", but enough to go unnoticed with that track alone. \n\nThen \"Transgression\" comes up and while a bit more reminiscant of the Soul of a New Machine days, some of the vocals sound displeasingly unmodulated, and the lyrics seem a bit immature like you'd expect from mtv \"metal\", but still a fine song.\n\nFollowing with \"Spinal Compression\", we go back to the Demanufacture era, and adds a touch of death metal to the mix. Still a good FF tune.\n\n\"Contagion\" sounds a lot like something you'd pick off Obsolete, and throws in FF's idea of \"melody\". Quite catchy, and has a good base of angst plus hopelessness in its sound, my second favorite track after the opener.\n\n\"Empty Vision\" hails next and is a great song for what should be the natural evolution of Fear Factory, though the song is a bit bland, and doesn't stand out like the opening track, I still commend it as being a true FF tune.\n\nNow comes the BAD news. After those tracks, I thought there might be a screw up on the disk, because only \"Moment of Impact\" on the remaining tracks really resembles Fear Factory. \"Echoes of my Scream\" literally made my jaw drop as it just seemed blasphemous. Sure they usually throw a slower somewhat \"melodic\" track on their albums, but this track may as well fit on an \"easy listening\" genre.\n\n\"Supernova\" and \"New Promise\" I will continue to refuse to believe were written by Fear Factory as they sound just like some melo-rock you'd get out of pop culture. \"I Will Follow\" was just an anathema for the band, whether it's a cover song or not. It did not stay true to the band's style in the slightest.\n\n\"Millenium\" and \"Empire\" are half-assed efforts that appear to be going the wrong direction at times, but still retain elements of Fear Factory.\n\nOverall, the album has a good startup, with a few \"oddities\" that are forgivable, but the second half with it's atrocious \"transgressions\" are significant and impious to the band's sound. Worth buying for a die hard Fear Factory fan, otherwise wait to hear the whole thing before deciding.\n",
        "\nEDIT (6/607): My original rating was a little high, so I fixed it.\n\nI'm actually not sure what all the hype over this album is about. I picked it up recently since I remembered having enjoyed the song \"Self Bias Resistor\" only to find out that I had already heard the best the album had to offer.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, if you've heard one song on this CD, you've really heard them all. Sure they all have some small thing that sets them apart from the others, but in general there just isn't much variety here. Same basic formula: some speedy (but triggered-sounding) drumming, catchy (but repetive) guitar riffs, absolutely no bass (reminds me of Metallica's ...And Justice For All album in that respect), keyboards and samples here and there (to add industrialness?), and mediocre growling plus some instances of clean singing. That's about it.\n\nAs for the music itself, I'll get my complaints out of the way first. The vocals are pretty bad. If you're going to do a death growl, do it right. The shouting that Burton Bell does just grates on my nerves. It sounds like death growls watered down enough that they have an edge, but won't scare the mallcore kiddies (that's another thing...this album is BARELY metal). Maybe I'm just a purist.\n\nAnother problem I have is the fact that they didn't add Christian Olde Wolbers' bass track to the final mix. Oh, they did? I certainly couldn't tell. Bass isn't as important in metal as the other instruments, but you can really tell when it isn't there. In this case it really detracts from the sound. I think the songs here would come off quite a bit better in concert.\n\nThe only other complaint is, as I said before, all the songs are pretty formulaic. But then again, some bands are just like that (*cough* Black Dahlia Murder *cough*)...you learn to live with it.\n\nThat having been said, the music on here isn't all bad. There are some songs that really do stand above the rest (\"Self Bias Resistor\" first and foremost) and it's a good disc to bang you head to in small doses. And when Bell is clean-singing, it sounds oddly cool.\n\nThis isn't a CD I would recommend buying, but listen to the title track, \"Self Bias Resistor,\" and \"Replica\" and see what you think.\n",
        "\nNow this isn't Fear Factory's first release (their first one was Concrete but was released in 2002) but it still shows how truly potential they are. This is Fear Factory before Demanufacture. That's right, they are just some other Death Metal band out there. But I have nothing against them in this album.\n\nHere, we have 17 recorded tracks for this album. All of these songs are quite incessantly brutal but there are some melodies in some of the tracks. Standouts of SOANM are the opener Martyr, Scapegoat, Crisis, Scumgrief, and Self Immolation. Martyr opens up with a quite brutal riff that jumps into soft, but guttural grunting and then it starts getting aggressive. Scapegoat goes on relentlessly on how a person is wrongfully accused and took the blame for a cause gone wrong. The basslines here are powerful, the guitars get distorted, the drumming blasts up mercilessly, and the vocals are unforgiving. These songs all have the intensity and ruthless aggression that will send you falling into a bottomless pit.\n\nSOANM does have its weak points. The production is very weak and I tried to put my CD player to the maximum volume. But it still felt soft to my ear and I wasn't happy. The production also made the drums sound like tin cans. That made me even more unhappy.\n\nThis is my review of the original version of SOANM. Finally there is a remastered version of this album with better and improved production. But then again, it is pointless already to get the remastered version. Oh, well...\n",
        "\nThis sweet little DVD is a must for any true fan of Fear Factory. The DVD covers everything Fear Factory, spanning their musical career, music videos, live performances, interviews, and misc. video footage... woohoo!\n\nThat's what I like about this DVD -- this DVD just doesn't include live footage or just music videos, it's a mixture of various footage and even bonus music tracks. Just make sure that when you pop this DVD into your TV/PC, you have a lot of free time ahead of the day because watching this can take almost half a day (well at least for me.) That's how much there is in this DVD, and it's not half-assed or boring.\n\nIt's like watching a movie, except it's a documentary of Fear Factory. If you played it like a movie, you'll see everything shifting from member interviews, live performances (old ones dating back to their death metal days and recent ones up to their nu-metal phase,) then back to some interviews/questioning, then a music video, then some misc. footage of the band on the road and being stupid, and so on.... etc, etc. The movie showcases everything in chronological order, from the first album released (Soul Of A New Machine) to their recent album at that time (Digimortal) so it's not a sloppy or disorganized documentary of the band. For someone like myself, this was some experience watching the DVD being I'm a huuuuge fan of Fear Factory and I've never actually seen Fear Factory perform live (I got this DVD when the band was inactive) and I never seen all of their music videos. I forgot to mention that the DVD has an excellent picture gallery ranging from fan art, to band promo photos, and so on. The DVD even offers nice wallpapers and screensavers for your PC which is always a nice treat.\n\nWith all the pro's of a release, there are the con's of course, and this DVD does have very little faults. I mentioned before about bonus music tracks (aka rare tracks/remixes) and yeah, the rare tracks really blows. I appreciate everything Fear Factory has done, even their nu-metal stuff, but these new/remixed/rare tracks really don't get me moving or entertained. Their nu-metal stuff was pretty good, but these nu-metal tracks are the really sucky kind of nu-metal which can compare to such bands like 30 Below Summer, Mudvayne and so on. I assume that's why most of these tracks weren't released on a full length or anything like that... humph, the band must have known that most of these tracks sucked.\n\nThis DVD is grand, and if you're a Fear Factory fan and don't have this in your little collection yet, then what the hell are you waiting for?! Get it and cherish it because this has got to be one of the best documentary DVD's of a metal band to come across. Even if you're not a true Fear Factory fan, this DVD is enjoyable to watch... either way, you'll be guaranteed to like it and might even become one with the Machines of Hate.\n\nEye Candy: Every little thing on this DVD is worth the minutes. Just try avoiding the audio tracks and you'll be just fine!\n",
        "\nHow many times have you heard of a \u201ccome-back\u201d album with stickers on it saying \u201cgoing back to their roots\u201d? St. Anger comes to mind, or Megadeth\u2019s last atrocity. I think Fear Factory is the only band that actually accomplished this. They fired the fatass guitarist, and now that the bassist does all guitar duties, it actually sounds tighter than before (maybe the fat got in Dino\u2019s way while playing). The drumming is beyond excellent, as is expected with these guys. They truly have something to say too, as the lyrics are a little bit more mature this time.\n\nThe songs are beefy, and even though the usual Fear Factory choruses with clean vocals exist, they don\u2019t seem overdone or \u201cold\u201d. Fear Factory definitely has a lot of energy, especially shown in songs like Cyberwaste, which actually makes me want to create something similar right now.\n\nThe only thing that could be criticized is that they downtuned even more (to B, luckily not lower), which does add a nice beefy sound, but it creates that feeling of typical death metal/nu-metal muddiness. The fact that Christian Olde Wolbers does both guitar and bass on this album makes the bass come out a little bit more, and the intro to the titletrack shows this. I obviously have a bias towards bass, but I love hearing a little more bass in the mix, so this adds a point to my rating.\n\nGood comeback, very energetic.\n",
        "\nNot a bad album at all, but the combination of repetitiveness and cheese (sweet lord the last two tracks are shit - tastic) brings it down a bit. Tracks like \"Shock\" and \"Obsolete\" are why you are happy you bought it, songs like \"Securitron\" and \"Hate -whatever whatever\" tire you out, songs like \"Timelessness\" piss you off.\n\n\"Shock\" is pure gold, one hell of an aggressive, angry song and the stop - start section at the end with Bell screaming SHOCK! is extremely headbangable. \"Edgecrusher\" is fucking sweet as well, an actual good use of scratching, I can see why they called it \"acid scratching,\" caustic and hissing sound. I have always liked the more deathy side of Fear Factory as opposed to the melody, but Bell's singing does hold them apart from other death bands. Then again, it was also their downfall into cheese, and while \"Descent\" is a good tune, you can tell it forebodes dark times of rancid radio filth for FF. \"Freedom or Fire\" is a good, chaotic and speedy track, \"Obsolete\" is good as well with an intro by Mr. Gary Numan (who, by the way, is a kind of punky -new wave space alien wierdo whose album with the Tubeway Army is worth checking out), and a very entertaining chorus.\n\nOverall, good, but the fear that Concrete - era FF will become Shitbag -era FF soon overwhelms the listener, and at the end there's no denying which era will soon be dominant.\n",
        "\nDue to Dino causing angst among the band members and Fear Factory having broken up for a short period of time back in 2002, we got a sudden mass of releases from Fear Factory to fulfill label requirements. One of these is Concrete, the other is Hateflies. Hateflies, is basically an album that on the outside, sounds interesting and unique. But when you get it, you suddenly realize there was a reason they didn't release a lot of these on things before.\n\nTracks 1-4 are songs that were for soundtracks of video games. The first track is \"Terminate\", from Terminator : Dawn of Fate. This was originally intended to be their last song they were ever to record. An apt last song, with the Terminator theme and whatnot. Overall this is done in the Digimortal style with extreme amounts of computer effects. Overall it's a decent song. The next track is \"Frequency\", recorded for the game \"Frequency\". Not so heavy on the computer effects as Terminate was, thankfully. This is a pretty decent track. The next two tracks are songs from \"Demolition Racer\". These songs were recycled into songs for Digimortal. The track \"Demolition Racer\" itself is utterly short and worthless coming in at 50-something seconds. \"Machine Debaser\", the last of the first four original songs, is a very good instrumental weighing in around 4 minutes. Basically it's well fit for a racing game as DR was, it builds up a lot.. Although it really doesn't go anywhere. It's anti-climatic, but the way it's done was fitting for what it was intended for originally. Alone, it's somewhat worthless, but interesting for the Fear Factory fan. Anyone else will get tired of it, fast.\n\nSo now we've covered the first four tracks. Everything that follows is a mass of remixes.. Basically this is like, Fear Factory : The Rejected Remixes. Oh well.. Track 5 is a remix on Invisible Wounds from Digimortal. The main difference to this is the chorus is has some effects on the vocals, it has a slightly different beat added in, and the heavier part in the bridge is missing. There's so little that's noticably different with this remix from the original, it's obvious why it wasn't really used for much of anything. Next track is a remix of Resurrection from Obsolete. This remix is.. Well, not very different from the original track, either. Maybe I'm just missing altogether what's different, but it just has a softer feel, expecially from the verses to the chorus and through the chorus.. And that's about it. There's barely anything worth noting besides that it doesn't serve any purpose. Another worthless remix. Next two tracks are remixes on Edgecrusher and Descent from Obsolete by Junkie XL. I frequently enjoy XL's remixing work.. But the Edgecrusher remix is merely sub-par, but at least it's a very noticable remix on the original. It seems to take the vocal structuring of the original, remove everything else from it, and add a new track which is very little more than a couple echoing sounds and a simple drum beat. It just doesn't hold your attention at all, and Burton's vocals sound horrible over it all. Descent's remix is similar, with a simple looping beat, and the way it goes to the chorus is ultimately, anticlimatic. To hear Burton screaming loudly and then just get a slightly louder, different beat doesn't do anything for me. Then halfway through the remix, it breaks into simple guitar riff from the song.. And then it sorta fades into the background over the beats again. It's interesting for a listen, but it's nothing you're really going to go back to listen to repeatedly. Track 9 is a version on Body Hammer from Demanufacture, this sounds pretty good. I'd even say it tops the version they chose for Demanufacture. As noted in the liner notes which briefly go over every song, Christian does an interesting bass riff which isn't in the final version used on Demanufacture. Finally, we make it to track 10 on the album, a different version on Zero Signal from Demanufacture. You can almost see the light at the end of the tunnel by now. This version is basically just different because Burton sings the verses in a more melodic way. But the way he does it here, is just bad. I'm thankful they didn't use this version. It's interesting to hear, but something I never want to listen to more than I have to. Burton's vocals keep going up and down, not giving an interesting effect, more of one that he just can't find a decent pitch for the song and doesn't know what to do with it. It just doesn't work, even for an alternate version, it's not enjoyable. Next is a remix on Cars from the digipak version of Obsolete. This has Gary Numan singing the song to the FF version, with Burton singing the last chorus with Numan. It's interesting, but this was never one of FF's stronger tracks to begin with. This version adds in a little bit more effects between the verses and chorus. I'd take this version to the regular FF version for certain.\n\nAfter all this is what I consider the best track from the entire CD.. A demo of Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies) from Digimortal, just titled Dark Bodies for the demo. This is overall a lot better than the version on Digimortal, and I'd prefer this to it any time. It's a little more deeper sound to it, and the chorus has an entirely different sound. Very worthwhile. The next track, 13 is a live version of Replica. There's not much to say about it. It's a good live track, but there's not too much special about it. Next is another Junkie XL remix, this one for H-K from Demanufacture. This is by far better than the other Junkie XL tracks up until this point. The beat is at least somewhat intriguing and doesn't sound like it was put together in 30 minutes. For the FF remix fan, this is fairly decent. For myself, it's better than what's been there but still not great. Next is another Junkie XL remix on HK. Yeah. Two HK remixes, from the same person in a row.. I don't know why.. The obvious joke available to use offhand is that this is.. Ahem, \"Overkill\"? Oh well. The second is by far superior to the first. Transgenic is more atmospheric and has an interesting feel to it. The next track, Transgenic, is a remix to New Breed from Demanufacture that gets very annoying, very fast. This has an almost constant thumping sound to it. This track pisses me off every time I forget to skip past it. Next is a better remix track, titled \"Manic Cure\". Not the best remix track on it's own right, but an interesting track to say the least with parts from New Breed, Replica, Body Hammer, and Self-Bias Resistor, all from Demanufacture. It's hard to really enjoy the remix for any reason besides that, however. Finally, we hit the last track on this mess of a CD.. Another remix of New Breed. Hope you like hearing the same songs remixed multiple times on a CD. The liner notes make a claim of, \"Love it or hate it, it's infectious and you will find it stuck in your head hours after you've heard it.\" Really? Funny, it slips my mind every time I hear it because it sucks poorly. It has a computerized voice singing \"We are the new breed, we are the future\" in a choiral attempting sound to open it up. Then it goes to more general \"techno\" sounds.. It has some of the original vocal tracks from the regular track, then it returns to the computer voice.. And it basically loops the \"music\" over and over. If it changes after that point from what's already been done 2 minutes before it, I certainly missed it. Then it ends, with the computer voice of sorts getting stuck on a note of singing \"future\".. And the CD's over.\n\nSo let's break it down. You had 4 new tracks, 2 of which you'll feel like you've heard in a worsened form on Digimortal, because you did.. One demo that practically carries the weight of the CD on its' own.. 3 unused original versions of songs released in different forms.. and 10 remixes from assorted albums, many of these remixes being done on the same track twice, which just makes the entire album all the more repetitious.\n\nI'd say get it if you're a fan of Fear Factory and want to hear a few decent tracks here and there, and want Terminate and Frequency on a CD, or if you're big into FF's remix albums, as this is basically what it is. But for everyone else.. Stay away from this. It's a fans-only album, by far. Very little is enjoyable, even considering the fact that I absolutely love Fear Factory, this album just pisses all over itself in an attempt to say goodbye to Fear Factory. Just be thankful they're back, and they (hopefully) won't be releasing any more trash albums of tracks they didn't already use for a reason.\n",
        "\nFear Factory released two albums previous to this that I thought were good but not great. Then this monster came along and totally realigned both my opinion and my spinal column while it was at it. This is, for me, the heaviest, best-structured, and most cohesive album FF released before they degenerated into nu-metal suckage and is my personal favorite of the lot. \n\nThe concept of the album is fascinating and intelligently-delivered, spinning a yarn of one man's (cyborg's?) search for freedom and independence in a post-apocalyptic scenario where individuality is devalued to the point of nonexistence (hmm...sounds kinda like the direction the USA is heading in politically these days...), and the intense struggle within and without he goes through to find it. During this story he questions everything including the existence of god and his own self-worth, and it is actually a pretty cool little story once you latch onto it. I find it really adds to the album's feel. \n\nOK, but is the music any good? Hells yes, it is! Raymond Herrera, although I HATE his drum sound (triggers to the max), is one of the most precise drummers I've ever heard, anchoring every song with grace as well as perfect time and killer double kick chops. Witness the rapid-fire flurries of double kick he tosses into the bridge part of \"Smasher/Devourer\" right after the second chorus...oh, man, is he TIGHT. Sounds like three-round bursts from an Uzi. \n\nDino is, of course, the MAN in the riff department--his writing style really defined FF's sound in the beginning, with his crisp yet deep downtuned 7-string (down to A, but this ain't no Korn wussjob). He gets in a nice clean chorused part in the chorus of \"Securitron (Police State 2000)\" that really suits the shifting of gears to a more melodic feel on those parts, as opposed to the syncopated, Pantera-like verses and the absolutely devastating mosh part that immediately follows the first chorus with a machinegun-like riff that chugs along with gut-wrenching intensity. As if you can't tell, this is one of my favorite songs on this album. \n\nDino also really owns on \"Edgecrusher\" with its simple, ultra-heavy riffing that is perfect for the song, and guest DJ Zodok's scratching on that tune adds to the chaotic-ness of it. The title track will compress your head down between your shoulders with its odd-meter verses, frenzied segue riffs, and its chorus is great to scream along to at the top of your lungs (\"MAN! IS! OBSOLETE!!! ERASED! EXTINCT!\"). Bassist at the time, Christian Olde Wolbers, doesn't let himself fade away, either; he gets plenty of exposure in the excellent and appropriately chilly-sounding mix with a variety of tones--from deep fuzz to clear and resonant, to even a bit of upright plunking and strumming on \"Edgecrusher\". \n\nMy other two real fave tunes here are the last two, \"Resurrection\" and \"Timelessness\". The first one is unabashedly melodic and catchy and features some nice and unobtrusive string parts on the chorus that really make the song soar and seem hopeful as the hero talks about finding the courage to go on in the face of incredible odds. And the last track...well, it takes a huuuge set of cojones to end a staggeringly heavy album like this with a song that is nothing but soothing strings and Burton singing his heart out, and it achieves the feel of the title perfectly. Before FF disappointed us all with their \"Descent\" into suckage, this was their apex--get it, already!\n",
        "\nI honestly cannot began to understand why the majority of people who have reviewed this Demanufacture are having orgasms over it. Other than a couple of songs that are enjoyable the rest of the CD soon becomes monotonous dribble.\n\nThe band makes good use of the industrial metal and death metal elements on this CD. For once in an industrial metal CDs damnation is not caused by the lead singer distorting his vocals so he sounds like a raped robot. For that listen to Blutrausch's \"Legions of the Sky\".\n\nInstead, where this albums damnation comes from is that it doesn't stand the test of time. During my first ten listens of this CD I too thought it was one of the greatest industrial CDs ever. All of the instruments on this CD had a near perfect use of unity and harmony. The distortion of the guitars only helped to enhance the CD. The additional programming used in this CD also helped it. The drumming of course was coursing with a few double dumbeats, but none the less it maintained the beat of the songs.\n\nSadly however the CD has now become too boring and too repetive for my personal tastes. Anytime I'm in the mood for industrial metal I'll put on this CD and trudge through the four songs I still enjoy, but then I turn it off just as quickly as I turned it on still craving for some industrial metal.\n\nFear Factory's \"Demanufacture\" is much like the bread of a staple heavy metal diet. Everyone needs to own this CD, but repeat listening of it might prove to be too difficult.\n\nStand Out tracks:\n\nReplica\nDog Day Sunrise\nH-K (Hunter Killer)\nDemanufacture.\n",
        "\nFear Factory has made a comeback of the rare kind this year, with their release of Archetype, back from the ashes and whatnot. But before they broke up, they managed to release an album which is classified by many as...well, crap. And of course, being who I am, I have to disagree. Digimortal is a great album, very different from Fear Factory's previous output, but nonetheless worthy. The songs revolve around a concept where man and machine merge together, forming a whole new society. In usual Burton C. Bell style, it's mostly very vague, and the songs can be interpreted in a multitude of ways, which is a good thing. While Digimortal is an aggressive record, it is also surprisingly melodic, and guitarist Dino Cazares seem very influenced by 80's dark wave music, departing from his usual all-out aggressive riffing, and infusing dark, melodic playing in most of the songs. Burton C. Bell uses a lot of harmonies, which enhances the mood of the music significantly. This is especially evident in songs like \"Digimortal\", \"Linchpin\", and \"(Memory Imprints) Never End\", where his haunting voice displays soothing emotions you'd be hard pressed to find in earlier Fear Factory works. The album is pretty diverse as well, ranging from the extreme catchiness and haunting feelings found in the ballad \"Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies)\" and the aformentioned tracks, to the cyborg-like hostility and aggressiveness found in song like \"Hurt Conveyor\", \"Acres of Skin\" and \"Byte Block\", to the mid-tempo tracks \"What Will Become?\" and \"No One\". There's something for most moods here. \n\nSadly, being influenced by the then strong rap-metal scene (cringe), they decided to collaborate with B-Real of Cypress Hill fame on the \"Worst Fear Factory Song This Side Of Soul Of A New Machine\", \"Back the Fuck Up\". It's a pretty useless song, and Fear Factory really shouldn't have done that, as it breaks up the flow of the album quite severely. Still, one turd among many great songs aren't enough to condemn an album. If you were so lucky as to buy the digi-pak version of Digimortal (hehe, digpack...Digimortal..hehe), there are four bonus tracks, where three of them rule immensely! \"Dead Man Walking\", \"Strain Vs. Resistance\" and \"Repentance\" could all be featured on the main album, as they have the same great quality as the rest. So it's a bit strange they didn't include them as normal songs. One reason could be that they didn't fit with the \"story\", so they decided to leave them out. Anyway, I'm glad I bought that version. The fourth bonus track, \"Full Metal Contact\", is from a video game (of the same name, I think), and is an intrumental, and in fact pretty useless, so the less said about it, the better. There is a little annoying detail I haven't mentioned. In many of the songs, between verse and chorus/bridge and chorus/whatever, Dino has chosen to fuck with the sound on his guitar, creating a bit of an anti-climax to the songs. It isn't a big problem, but I'm glad he wasn't in the band for Archetype, who knows what he would've done on that? \n\nOverall, Digimortal is a very fine album, with strong songwriting, mostly nice instrumentation, and great production, with little to complain about. A warning though; it is not for metalheads who don't like experimentation or modern (as in somewhat hip) metal. Otherwise, you should take a listen. :)\n",
        "\nThis album is good. It is no \u2018Soul of a new machine\u2019 or \u2018obsolete\u2019, but this album is good in it\u2019s own way. First off, it\u2019s simply nice to see that Fear Factory are back and making music again, they have always been a talented band in my eyes. But anyways, lets start with the vocals. Burton does kind of growly vocals, and then he will switch them to regular vocals, this might actually not sit right with a lot of people, it might depend on your tolerance for melodic breakdowns.\n\nNext is the guitar work. This album features some pretty good riffs, nothing mind blowing but they can be catchy at times and are for the most part good, next time around though, it might be nice to see a little more of their technical skill we all know they are capable of displaying.\n\nThe Drums on the album, also seem simple at times, but none the less, they are played very well, and are probably one of my favourite parts of this album, they always seem to go along with the music perfectly and are very functional.\n\nI don\u2019t know about the lyrics with this album, some of it just seems kind of nu-metalish. The first time I found the especially notable was in the song \u2018Cyberwaste\u2019 when the first lyrics are \u201cNothing you say matters to us!\u201d \u201cFuck you\u201d. I don\u2019t know, that just seems like it didn\u2019t need to be there, I would like to think that they are capable of more intelligent lyrics than that, but that isn\u2019t saying the whole album is bad for this, just at certain times like that. \n\nI my only other criticism of this album is the Nirvana cover \u201cSchool\u201d. I just think that is totally out of place and is not a good song to begin with. It\u2019s simply a miracle that FF can play their instruments so well to give the song some goodness. So anyways, this album is worth picking up of you are a Fear Factory song, are in the mood for something a little more simple and easy to get in to.\n",
        "\nI have ignored this band for a long time. I heard a few songs scattered here and there over the years but the only 2 things that came to my mind were - industrial metal and *gasp* mallcore. Well, guess what? I HATE both genres. So logically, I avoided Fear Factory like the plague. \n\nAnyhoo, one night while watching MTV's Headbangers Ball (oh the horror of it all), I come across the video for \"Cyberwaste\". The second that it finished I thought to myself \"Boy, I would really like to hear that again.\" Passing it off as maybe a slight bout of hysteria, I TRIED to ignore the fancy thought. But guess what? I could not. I could not get the friggin' song out of my head. Everything about the song would lead me to hate it but I didn't. \n\nI NEEDED to hear it again. So at the next trip to Newbury Comics, I find this album used for only $6.99. Hey, I can cough up that much for something I will probably sell back the next day, right? Uh, well, I spun this album and for fucksake if I did not dig the majority of this album, dammit. \n\nBefore I go into the songs, I will just say I still sense the industrial and mallcore leanings throughout this album. FF fanboys can cry blasphemy all they want but I gotta be honest here. FF are to my ears, a degree of mallcore. Not mallcore like the putrid Limp Dick or Stinkin Park and not even mallcore like Korn or Slipknot for that matter. But in its essence, this music is ............uh, lets see.........how to we -put this................a crossover of metal and mallcore. There are no solos, there are stop/start riffs, there are angst lyrics to a degree, and some of this stuff is MTV/radio friendly. \n\nBottomline, despite what I think this music is, I still really like this album and just like Halford came out for his love of penis, I must come out of the closet to admit that I like Fear Factory. *double gasp* \n\nI would give a detailed description of the songs but this is Fear Factory. THe creation of the wheel is nowhere to be found. Its machine gun drums and riffing, with Burton's mix of growling and clean vocals with some sound effects. You know what this band sounds like and they STILL sound like that. \n\nSo you ask \"Why the fuck are you even bothering writing a review about this?\" Good question but my only answer to this is simple. Its about ths songs, man. Yeah, thats right - the FUCKING songs. This is top notch SONGWRITING. Talk about melody and being catchy and still wanting you to headbang and thrash out - this shit does just that. \n\nSongwriting - the lost art. Metal bands of all genres today are too worried about being br00tal, speed, being grim, shredding, or being a bombastic choir or whatever else. However, they forget about writing good fuckin' songs. But a final guess what? Fear Factory does not forget on this album. \n\nThese are flat out great songs regardless of classification. Songs like Slave Labor, Act of God, Cyberwaste, Drones, and Archetype are written very well. Not too long, not too short, appropriate mix of growls/clean vox, and very memorable choruses. \n\nBesides the songwriting, note should also be given to Burton. His vocals are very good on both ends of the spectrum and the best part - he doesn't fucking WHINE! Also, the lyrics are better than your average nu-metal shite. \n\nFinal point - this album ends on 2 sour notes - the songs Ascension and School (a Nirvana cover for chrissakes). Both songs suck big time but thank god they are at the end so for me, this album ends with \"Human Shields\". \n\nMallcore, its not your annoying little brother's music anymore.\n",
        "\nFast drumming is nice- very nice. Pretty nice vocals are nice- pretty nice, meh riffs are ok- but not very. And thats really what we have here, who really cares about the bass? Me. Its good. I remember when I heard that Dino wrote all the bass lines, and the riffs- I figured that the band was dead with him gone. Apparently those rumors were COMPLETELY false, hell, I bet Christian wrote the fucking riffs. Archetype is better, I'll say that.\n\nI remember hearing so many things about how this album is this, how its awesome, how its that and how its \"Essential.\" None of that really came to be here, its mediocre in my book, and aside from maybe a couple above average tracks (Replica and H-K, and maybe Body Hammer), its just another album.\n\nMy problem isnt really with the musicinaship, but how people raved about it, because while its pretty good, its not \"Essential\" in ANY way. Maybe for someone who likes pretty good metal on industrial standards- but if I wanted that, I'd go back and listen to ...and Oceans' third release, Am God. Its what this album should have been, but in its own style.\n\nSome would say thats exactly what it is, others like myself say any music can be the same but with a different take on it- sort of like covers. Now, once again I'm not saying I don't like it, but that its not perfect and not horrible, but too raved. The drumming is top notch stuff, some of the riffs are too, the bass lines are sick, the vocals are cool, catchy, and simple in the good way- but the lyrics can get repetitive (see New Breed), so thats a bit of a let down in itself. The electronics and the \"industrial\" elements used are real nice to hear, and fit well with everything.\n\nNote how I say I like all the musicianship, but the songs themselves are only OK. I would definatly reccomend this, as it IS pretty good, but it dosn't deserve the title alot give it.\n",
        "\nHow on earth am I meant to review this?\n\nI shall put aside all the cynicism and slight resentment I felt not just around the time rumours were flying round about a reformation, but when that had been confirmed and it was being speculated as what it would sound like.\n\nLet's get this straight. Regardless of your personal views on whether or not this is \"Fear Factory\" - referring to the acrimonious ditching of Dino Cazeras, moving Wolbers up to guitar, and bringing in old buddy Byron Stroud on bass - the fact of the matter is, politics aside, this is far far stronger an album than Digimortal (which some would rightly argue doesn't exactly take much) and to a certain extent better than Obsolete.\n\nThe overall sound is not easy to categorically put down, but the majority of the material fits into a sort of period of time in between Demanufacture and Obsolete, with the occasional - and slightly nauseating - overlong melodic breakdown. One thing has to be mentioned as well, sure Raymond Herrera has pretty much proved virtually all his critics wrong about how excellent a drummer he is just because of the triggers, by doing some really strong work on this album.... the only thing is he seems to have borrowed at least one or more of Lars Ulrichs infamous drums from the recording of St Anger. \nNormally in the course of the songs this is for the most part masked by the now-trademark machine-gun riffing, but occasionally it shows itself up to be quite annoying.\n\nWhether or not Fear Factory can arrest the current backlash seemingly aimed straight at them from the slightly dubious split-cum-reformation or the hatred hurled at their previous (incarnation's) studio attempt - the flop that was 'Digimortal'. By reading some of the lyrics though, I honestly don't think they care that much, either that or they have even more bravado than ever.\n\nI won't bother with a song by song breakdown, as basically anyone that can recognise an 'Obsolete' period Fear Factory song will pretty much know what to expect here.\n\nSome have said mixed things from this being Fear Factory's heaviest release since their debut, or their heaviest full stop. Well yes in places this is heavier than Demanufacture, but that was as far more a rounded individual and QUALITY weight-around-your-neck as you're likely to get.\n\nDon't expect great things from this album and you won't be disappointed. (Believe the hype and) Expect the best album Fear Factory have made, and be very disappointed indeed.\n",
        "\nLets get this out of the way right now: This is Fear Factory's greatest release easily. Hell, this is probably one of the best metal albums of all time. I haven't heard many albums as super as this one and I doubt I ever will. I also doubt Fear Factory will ever reach this level again.\n\nAnyways... FF started off being a somewhat bland death metal band which threw in melodic vocals. But this album they arose to so much more. The growls were exchanged for angry yelling, and the melodic vox was cleaned up. Machine Gun percission drumming was also introduced, as well as alot of industrial influences. The band made quite the change, and it was all for the better.\n\nThe album opens with the title track, Demanufacture. The song is aboslute badass. Nearly every song on this album IS badass, with the exception of two (Flashpoint and \u00a1Resistancia!). The epic \"Pisschrist\" which features the most beautiful closing I've ever heard, the catchy \"Replica\" which is good for working out, the fast and furious \"H-K\" which will really get your addrenalin going, to an industrial fest you can dance to like New Breed. There's so much positive things to say about this album I don't even know where to start.\n\nStandout tracks are \"Demanufacture\", \"Self Bias Resistor\", \"Replica\", \"H-K\", and \"Pisschrist\". But calling them the standouts isn't really fair, as nearly all of the album is superb. If this album isn't in your collection I suggest adding it as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed.\n",
        "\nAfter recent Fear Factory releases there was much left to be desired. Now, with the absence of Dino Cazares, the band hammers out their attempt at a good album again. And it worked, sorta...\n\nThe album opens with what is literally one of their best songs ever, Slave Labor. Every little bit of this song is great. The vocals, the lyrics, the bass kicks, the guitar, everything. In fact, there's no a dull moment on the album... For the frist half of it. Slave Labor, Cyberwaste, Corporate Cloning, and Archetype are all amazing tracks, and Act of God and Drones are decent enough as well. But it's the second half of the disc where things get a little, um, uncool.\n\nTracks like Undercurrent, Bite The Hand That Bleeds, Human Shields are just flat out boring songs. Then there's the utterly terrible Bonescraper, which features Korn-like guitar riffs, Default Judgement which musically sounds like Rammstein's Sonne. The worst thing on the album overall though is \"Ascension\" which is all synth, and rehashed vocals from a couple other songs on the disc. It's a snore. The only thing that redeems the second half of the disc is the cover of Nirvana's \"School\" which is one hell of an accomplishment, since they took a shitty song and made it great. \n\nThe album really is a mixed bag, I do recomend it though for fans, as in some ways it's a return to Demanufacture. But be weary, in some ways it's also a return to Digimortal (the vocal department). Overall, 70/100\n",
        "\nBefore I review this, i'd just like to state that i've never considered Digimortal that bad of an album. My only real beef with it was Back the Fuck Up (obviously) and the fact that it just wasn't an 'epic' album like Obsolete or Demanufacture. \n\nThat's why Archetype is a return to form for Fear Factory to these ears. Musically, Archetype is a subtle readjustment of all of Fear Factory's previous trademarks. It abandons almost all of the minute electronic detailing that featured so prominently in Digimortal, and instead relegates it to a background role subservient to atmosphere and mood. Song lengths have increased in time over Digimortal, which allows more space for that 'epic' feel that was lacking in the to-the-point approach of Digimortal. Herrera's guitar-complementing double bass is the same as it ever was, but the riffs themselves are generally similar to Digimortal in thier limited scope and length, giving Archetype a punishing and unified percussive approach. The return to form however lies in the splicing of this with the very expansive but arguably underdeveloped choruses of Burton's clean vocals. While the heaviness of Fear Factory is still there, the softer songs like Human Shields, Archetype and Undercurrent succeed in establishing a sombre and foreboding mood that is reminiscent of A Therapy For Pain or Timelessness but not the overeagerly attempted in Invisible Wounds and Memory Imprints from Digimortal. The result is a successful sober balance that many would likely call a 'maturing' of Fear Factory. \n\nThat's not to say Archetype is completely successful, because it's not. While inspired, varied, and textured in many places, there are definately some moments that just fail utterly. 'Bite the Hand that Bleeds' could very well be the worst song Fear Factory has ever written; a slow and uneventful song filled with clean vocals which literally go nowhere and have no hook whatsoever. It's painful listening to Burton striving so hard and hitting no interesting notes whatsoever. Default Judgement takes one mediocre riff and murders it ad infinatum for the entire song, the quiet drums/whispered vocals sections and clean choruses don't alter the fact that sometimes Fear Factory just don't write interesting enough riffs to support 4 or 5 minutes worth of material. On the other side of the spectrum, the all-synth closer Ascension is completely unneccessary. Almost nothing happens in it and its minimalism does nothing for the charged atmosphere established by the rest of the album.....why it's there at all is puzzling. \n\nHaving said all that, my ultimate feeling after listening to the album is that it is a decent return to form, but maybe not quite the masterpeice some may credit it as in comparison to the much-bashed Digimortal.\n",
        "\nNice review title, I know. But you have to admit, all the guys in Fear Factory are fucking short. haha. Anyways...on to the actual album...\n\nYes, Digimortal has a nu-metalish sound to it, but its still fucking awesome. The music is impressive and catchy so I can easily get past that downside. Back The Fuck Up also has some rapping in it, which I do not like at all, but overall its an excellent song.\n\nThis album is just packed full of rage and energy. It sounds more like thrash than anything (other than the industrial sounding production). Most of the songs on here are worthy of some serious headbanging. The vocals are strong and clear, and they are always pushing the music forward. There's nothing too technical about this album, but when you put all the instruments together they make killer songs.\n\nBest Tracks: What Will Become?, Damaged, Linchpin, Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies), and Strain Vs. Resistance.\n",
        "\nAlthough I'm not too familiar with Demanufacture(the only song I've heard from it is Zero Signal), I can say that this remix album is very good. People who have actually heard Demanufacture may not appreciate this album because they may think that the originals were terribly bastardized. Ignorance is bliss for me however, for reasons I've already stated. This release can stand out on its own as an unexpectedly headbangable fusion of electronica and metal. \n\nThe title track opens the album with a mindblowing fury of electronica and metal that rages like a dark horse of the apocalypse. Later in the song there is an 'electronic' drum solo that is very mesmerizing. This song could hold its own in a techno rave party.\n\nThe second song is National Panel Beating and begins with ominous piano playing and clean, spiteful vocals that give way to Burton C. Bell's trademark ranting. I really enjoy his voice, both when he is clean singing and when 'growling'. He has a way of blending a Meshuggah-like rant style with a death metal growl and it's totally cool.\n\nFollowing this is Genetic Blueprint. This sounds like a song that would fit well on a video game. Maybe a fighting game or a racing game. Great amalgam of techno and metal.\n\nThe fourth song is the remix of Zero Signal. Though I am quite a fan of the original, the remix is quite disappointing. There's just not much going for it. The beat is lackluster and the keyboards are just weird. \n\nTrack 5 is Bionic Chronic. This is just an interlude, but it's damn cool. This is the kind of song you would play if you were driving through the streets in a Lamborghini trying to pick up babes.\n\nNext is Cloning Technology, which begins with harsh techno that sounds like the winds of a hurricane before erupting into some more harsh drum playing. Then, it's to a simple metal melody. The pre-chorus is especially cool because it is a vocal crescendo.\n\nI don't easily recall track 7, so I'll move on to track 8, T-1000. This is killer, folks. It consists of a pounding bass-line with hand-clapping and complementary wicked guitar-riffing, with plenty of interesting vocal layering to boot.\n\nMachines of Hate is the following song and it's one of the most syncopated of the album, if not the most. The chorus is particularly uplifting. \n\n21st Century Jesus is absolutely wicked. It's not as overtly exciting as many of the other songs, but it has a creepy atmosphere. It begins with the lyrics \"Body of Christ\" repeated over and over again. This isn't explicitly blasphemic, but as a Christian it is a little disquieting. The melody on this song would fit very well on an Enya album it's so relaxing. Well, that is before the apocalyptic guitar/electronica onslaught surfaces. Often, I have difficulty discerning if a guitar is playing or if it is a synthesizer. Oh well. Towards the end of this song there is some super-dense guitar riffs consisting of about 4 notes each. \n\nTrack 11 is Bound For Forgiveness, and it is very atmospheric like its predecessor, yet less straightforward. This is what it would sound like if you were trapped in a dark, desolate swamp in another dimension. Very brooding. T\nTrack 12, Refinery, is next and it's nothing more than just a composition of various refinery sounds.(metal clashing together, etc.) Nothing special, but quite relaxing.\n\nFinally, track 13 is the edited version of Remanufacture. Obviously since this is the edited version of the first track, it's a little different. However, I can't note the difference off the top of my head. Basically, it's the same song over again. It's a lame idea, but at least it's not unlistenable. \n\nWhen trying to decide if this album is more electronica/techno or metal, I'd say the former, but there's enough metal on this album for a metalhead to enjoy. For those of you have Demanufacture and enjoy it, listen to this album with an open mind. As for me, I hold it in high regard. Overall, this album is quite catchy, headbangable, and would be good to rave to.\n",
        "\nFear Factory's 4th release (but not last, they have a new one in April 2004) got mixed reviews. For some people they thought that they had gone nu-metal because of the crappy \"back the fuck up\" song (rap's not a music genre.) But there are some good songs on this album. I will review only the good songs. (Not in order)\n\nDamaged: This is one of the better songs on the album. It reminds me of Demanufacture lite. It starts off with \"I'm damaged for love\" and then goes into a heavy-ended sounding guitar riff. at 0:17 Rhys Fulber's keyboards kick in and gives it the industrial feel that is the Fear Factory trademark. The vocals are pretty good but they are nothing compared to Soul of a new Machine and Demanufacture. By that I mean that the death growl has been lost. However there are some pretty good trademark clean vocals about 2 minutes iunto the song.\n\nLinchpin: Holy shit this is a good song. In fact it is probably the best one on the record. It is catchy and a good song for moshing. Sure the drums sound like a drum machine (BUT THEY ARE NOT!) and the vocals may havbe been drenched in electronic keyboards, but they are still ok.\n\nWhat Will Become: This is the intro track and for the first ten seconds there's a really really weird sounding guitar riff. Then Rhys's electronics kick in and gives the song it's own unique flavor. In fact, this song probably (at least out of all the songs I have heard from Fear Factory which is all but 5 or so) has the most evident electronics. Ah well, that's what industrial metal is all about. Plus the intro to the second verse has a really weird sounding riff as well. There are also some very very very weird sounding noises around 2:13 and last till 2:31.\n\nWell I could go more into the songs but those are my three favorite from this album. Like I said this is my least favorite album by Fear Factory. Let's hope Archetype is better. But this isn't \"nu-metal\" like people keep saying except for the rap song. Another reason is that this was Dino's last album. He will be missed but we have Brujeria and Assenio for his other talents. He never was a good guitarist, but he was integral to the Fear Factory formula. Also this i Rhys Fulber's last album with Fear Factory. He has rejoined his old group \"Front Line Assembly\" which is an industrial group. Check them out if you like industrial in general like me. Try their millennium album, it has Devin Townsend on guitars! (shameless advertising)\n",
        "\nHmm, I\u2019ve never really liked fear factory, and this album doesn\u2019t really change that. The drumming is extremely samey; it just sounds like a drumming machine. The vocals, in my opinion, are just well, nothing spectacular being mainly a half-arsed death growl while sometimes alternating to a cleaner style. Yes, it is plenty brutal, offering many a blast beat, but isn\u2019t very memorable. Everything is just recycled, putting in some random samples so not to sound EXACTLY the same. Oh, and the guitar tone is horrible! Total mallcore shit.\n\nThe title track is probably the best track on here. It kind of alternates between growls and clean vocals a lot, and the overall melodic feeling of the song sounds OK.\n\nInvisible Wounds (Dark Bodies) is a ballad in fear factory terms: no growling, no double bass, etc, etc. Back the F*** up is an extremely fucking shit \u2018song\u2019 its just kind of extreme-rap. Many of my friends dig this song, so yeah, it\u2019s fucking shit; they like slipknot etc.\n\nHurt Conveyer is probably the most brutal song on here. The chorus is 100% full on. But those little samples or what ever the fuck they are really hurt my ears when listening to it on headphones. oh, this song would be cool if it was renamed 'Dust Collector'... or not.\n\nAlright, not every song is reviewed, but they all sound the same.\n\nHmm, I think this album could have been better if they tried for something different, but hey, they didn\u2019t and we got what we got. Its good for what its worth, but nothing memorable.\n",
        "\nWhen I wandered into the record store on a rainy afternoon a few years ago, not knowing what I intended to buy, I spotted this album on the shelf, and not knowing what to expect, I took a chance and purchased it. I remember this really angsty chick in my eighth grade class that was obsessed with Fear Factory, so I guess I wanted to find out what all the fuss was about. \n\nAnyway, this album is filled with excellent, Industrial-esque drum and guitar work, but it has much more of a watered down death metal feel to it, overall. Raymond Herrera does such a great job with the double bass that I'd be hard pressed to find a formidable contender. Burton Bell's vocals are yelled with a very throaty rasp to them, sort of like a white version of Max Cavalera, but better (I guess). As for the bass, I didn't notice any outstanding qualities about it, but it's sufficient.\n\nIn closing, you can't really go wrong with this album, especially compared to the band's later work. Some of the tracks may sound like filler next to the excellent Zero Signal and New Breed, but don't let that deter you. Fear Factory seemingly showed promise with this album, but God knows what caused them to transition into a typical Nu-Metal band (Gee, maybe their label, Roadrunner records?).\n",
        "\nOk, so I'm a fan of fear factory and i'm not afraid to admit it. Their releases before this are wicked awesome. And here lies the problem with this release. Its not wicked awesome. \n\nThe cd opens with What Will Become, which is a pretty decent song. Its has all the usual FF trademarks, except it is softer than anything on Obsolete. Damaged is next and again, we have all the usual FF tricks. It has a pretty catchy chorus and is a bit heavier than the opening track. Nothing all that memorable though. The title track is next and its quickly becoming obvious the band is somewhat softer now. Burton throws out his clean vocals, which are very good, but should be used to songs Ressurrection or Timelessness. No One is next and a good sign is we're back to the heavier songs, though there is some stupid keyboard thing in here. Its pretty cool though and has a good breakdown , \"take one, take one shot, one more shot at me\". Linch pin is up next and this is pretty bad. It has a stupid intro and it gets even worse. I can't even describe how much this song sucks. Invisible Wounds is next and the band seems to be trying to do ressurrection part 2. It works on some levels, but is somewhat of a hit & miss.\n\nAcres of Skin is next and finally, there is some fucking aggression on here! This intro brings to mind the days of Demanufacture. If the whole cd was like this, I would be saying much more good things about it. The next song...nothing could prepare anyone for the absolute awfulness of this song. Back the Fuck Up is the title and its a straight up rap song. PUKE! \n\nAfter this, the cd is just sort of akward after that stupid rap song. The songs are ok but don't really do much to grab the listener. The song Memory Imprints is another pretty good soft songs and ends the cd, for those without the digi pack. Now for those with the Digi version, these songs are actually pretty good. Dead Man Walking is the first of the bonus songs and starts like it could have been on Obsolete. Good song. The other bonus tracks are just as good and the last one is an instrument song.\n\nIn the end, this is a dissapointing cd, considering the previous cds the band put out, like the amazing Demanfucature and the also great Obsolete. Some of the tracks bring to mind these releases, others are just there, while some are plain out awful. I would have given this a lower rating, but I have the digi version, to the bonus tracks brought the rating back up.\n\nbest songs imo: no one, acres of skin, memory imprints, dead man walking.\n",
        "\nThe first track of Fear Factory's swansong basically sums it all up. What will become? The album for some will leave quite a bitter taste in the mouth and unfortuantly for the fans, the band was unable to make a new original record to get that taste out. Before I go into details on the tracks one, the first thing you will notice after you put this album into your cd player is the time of this disc. The Digipak version which includes 4 bonus tracks as well as the original 11 is only 56minutes long. That is an average of 3minutes and 45 minutes. Most Fear Factory songs are OVER 4 minutes not under. Yet on these 15 tracks only TWO songs are over 4minutes. This is indeed, as Raymond put it, \"An album for those with short attention spans\". Now to the songs.\n\n\"What Will Become?\" is a typical Fear Factory intro. A slow begining that soon turns up the noise. Rhys Fulber does yet another amazing job with the electronics here and this Fear Factory album but be their greatest achievement in using Electronics. The problem is, when you do finally get into \"What Will Become\" it ends. But it just does not end but rather it has a child saying \"us\". For me this was uneccessary and takes away for the song. Sure, it might be less than a second but why did the band use it?\n\nThe next track \"Damage\" has once again amazing electronics and a great sounding chrous. However like the previous song when you are about ready to go on a killing spear the music ends and thus killing the moment. Do not get me wrong, the song is great, but it would have been so much better if it were just another 30seconds long. \"Replica\" was under 4 minutes but it was long enough to give you a complete feeling. \"Damage\" is good, but not complete.\n\n\"Digimortal\", the title track, suffers from yet again the same fate as the previous two songs! It has a great chrous line with amazing clean vocals but ends far to quickly. The song is a little \"poppy\" sort of like Soilwork's latest release.\n\n\"No One\" is probably the best song using this new \"short attention span\" theory. What makes this song different from the first 3 is that it FEELS complete. The song goes as long as it can but is still strong enough to keep its own. The bassdrum beats have never sounded better.\n\n\"Linchpin\" might be the catchiest thing the band has ever done. The clean vocals sound a little too much like \"Digimortal\" and when you check the linear notes you will notice that there was some special vocal programming done for...well...you guessed it, \"Linchpin\" and \"Digimortal\". The song is nice but once again, just a tad too short. An extra 15seconds would have done wonders to this song.\n\n\"Invisible Wounds(Dark Bodies)\" is a wonderful track starting out with a nice bassline and leading into mystical(yes thats right, mystical) synths and keyboards. The song sounds similar to \"Descent\" but has a different feel to it. The bridge in this song throws a monkey wrench into things but it actually completes the song well. The song is just under 4 minutes and that is a perfect length for this song. A job well done and it comes right in the middle of the album.\n\n\"Aches of Skin\" is the heaviest song on the track resembling musicianship closer to \"Soul of a New Machine\". The drum track sounds great on this song and should not be overlooked. A very nice song that is unfortuantly followed up by,,,\n\n\"Back the F**K Up\"...terrible. This is without a doubt the worst thing the band has ever done. This is a prime example of what should have been left on the drawing board. The song just stinks from the get go. Rapping has no place with Fear Factory or metal for that matter. The song is so terrible that the band lost 5 points just from one listen from this. The song alone almost ruined the whole disc. I cannot express my hatred for this song. Hear it once and just skip it from there on. The song doesn't even have good lyrics on top of that. You have been warned.\n\n\"Byte Block\" is the best track on this album and the first one to go over 4 minutes. It has amazing song structure and great sounding vocals. This is one that I keep coming back. It's hard, it's heavy, it is Fear Factory. After hearing the putrid that is \"Back the F**K up\" this song picks up real nicely.\n\n\"Hurt Convoryer\" is pretty much the same as \"Aches of Skin\" but with more use of synths and keyboards. The problem with this track is its placement. It does not belong as the next to last track. Look at \"Obsolete\" and \"Demanufactured\" notice how the next to last song has an epic ending. \"Pisschrist\" has its errie \"Where is your savior now?\" line and \"Ressurecction\" is easy on the ears and flows nicely to \"Timelessness\". This song does neither. It is good, but it does not flow well to...\n\n\"(Memory Imprints) Never End\" is probably the best of the Fear Factory ballad endings. It is a little harder than their previous two endings but it has a very nice feel to it. This is the second of the over-4-minutes song. It is just an amazing song in which Rhys Fulber shows his talent. Without the keyboards and synths this would be just a regular song but with them it is something different.\n\nThus the album ends. I give it a 70, however, I did purchase the Digipack version. So I will now review those 4 and give you a total rating..\n\n\"Dead Man Walking\" makes me wonder why this is a b-side. It pretty much follows the formula for the whole \"short song\" structure by why was it left off the original record. The chrous is great, the vocals are great, and the electronics are great. I would have much rather seen this over the dreaded \"Back the F**k Up\"\n\n\"Straind vs. Resistance\" has a way more fast feel to it. It sounds like \"New Breed\" just not as hard. \"New Breed\" in my opinion was a good short song. That means this is as well. The chrous line is the most melodic thing on the record next to the token ballad. Still, its a strong song. Still makes me wonder why this is a b-side.\n\n\"Repentence\" is the heavier of the b-sides. Once again it follows the strucutre of the whole album. Fast and to the point. Nothing amazing but well above average. Yet again this is a b-side? Who was putting this record together? The band or Roadrunner?\n\n\"Full Metal Contract\" is an instrumental!?! Sounds pretty werid at first but its a nice track. I can see how this did not make the album as it really does not fit anywhere but...well...track 15. Nice and fast which one of the more original guitar riffs on the album.\n\nWell the original version of Digimortal receives a 70 from me, but when you add in those 4 great tracks I think a rating of 75 should be apporpiate. So I will give this a 73. If the band had just left off that ONE song this could have been something stronger. Not exactly their strongest but at the same time how many bands write a great unexpected swansong. If you find it used you might want to consider.\n"
