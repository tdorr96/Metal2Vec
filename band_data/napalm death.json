        "\nMy first approach to metal was direct with Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Sepultura at 10 years old. I was fortunate to have older relatives who owned collections of hundreds of cassettes, CDs, underground metal magazines, and all kinds of paraphernalia that made me hallucinate at that age with the metal genre. At school, I was privileged to be surrounded by people who had been involved in heavy metal for years, so at the age of 12 I was already a connoisseur of bands that today are classified as \"essential classics\".\n\nBut one day... a boring Sunday afternoon in the year 2001. A friend came home and gave me the Napalm Death \"Scum\" cassette. I wasn't able to hear even half of it. for me, it was a disaster, nonsense, so I passed this album and didn't pay attention to it again. But 5 years later, I tried to give it a chance, already more familiar with this genre called \"Grindcore\", but I just couldn't stand it. I couldn't hear it completely. For me, there were better bands from the same era and the same style, but better executed, such as Repulsion, Nausea, Carcass, Terrorizer, etc., etc.\n\nThis album, \"scum\", fails in several aspects that are minimal to make this something enjoyable at least. Given that the genre is not known for producing polished productions, is this album a shambles in terms of mixing?. drums sometimes sound, but other times they get lost between the roar of the bass and the guitar, The voice doesn't even sound brutal or chaotic, it just sounds like a bad hardcore singer. Everything is badly mixed here. The cymbal set sometimes has more prominence than the rest of the instruments, not to mention the damn echo of the bass.\n\nI know that this album is divided into two parts with different formations, but I was able to listen to it in its entirety and draw my own conclusions. I must say that it is complete rubbish, too amateurish to be enjoyed. Those were lousy riffs, even for a 14-year-old starting out to record their first demos. I know there are people who say they love this album, but no one really enjoys it when listening to it (I can tell). It's not even a \"revolutionary\" album; there were already bands doing the same thing a couple of years before like: Siege and Infest.\nThe fact that there were contemporary bands to Napalm Death that did the same style but in a better way and with more interesting themes than what \"scum\" represents. It makes me wonder... how the hell did such a bad album become a classic for some?.\nOnce I was walking to work through an old alley and I read on the wall of a factory a graffiti that said: \"grindcore is not death metal, hardcore is not violence\" and this album came to my mind. Clearly, \"Scum\" has nothing to do with Death Metal and is more related to punk, hardcore, and political positions that serve as incentives for hypocritical teenagers with identity crises and sexual frustrations.\n\nI swear to God, I know several Napalm Death fans and none of them really enjoy listening to this slop. There's nothing really metal here, and you can find more riffs and metal solos on UK.Subs albums than on \"Scum\".\nTo be fair with my final sentence, I must say that what Napalm Death wanted to do with \"Scum\" is better achieved in \"From Enslavement to Obliteration\", which is not to my liking either. This leaves me with \"Harmony Corruption\".\n",
        "\nAh yes, Napalm Death's Scum, seen by many as the record when it comes to early grindcore. It's a bit more complex than the age-old debate of what was truly the first death metal album, Seven Churches or Scream Bloody Gore, since one can't look over the punk scene that grind mainly draws from. Looking over it is exactly what I will have to do, however, since I am not particularly familiar with the topic. When it comes to the \"metal side\" of grind, it mostly boils down to Scum vs. Horrified. The latter, while being recorded a few weeks earlier, wouldn't be properly released until 1989, when other acts like Carcass, Terrorizer and Fear of God had already put in their 2 cents worth. Back to Scum however, its two sides were recorded almost a year apart by two completely different lineups that just happened to share the iconic crinkled logo of Napalm Death. I have to mention here that the era of vastly different lineups was far from over for this particular band\u2026\n\nI will eventually get to the elephant in the room, but let's begin with the 1986 side A. First off, I am a huge sucker for intros, whether they introduce an album or even just a longer track. Multinational Corporations is in my eyes a perfect overture to grindcore as a whole. I still remember first hearing the cymbals and the subtle melody, which fades wonderfully into the omnipresent distortion and the chanted vocals that just build the tension perfectly. If this is your grindcore premiere, the thoughts in your head should be: this is going to be one hell of a genre!\n\nWhat follows is a flurry of eleven other tracks, and most of them are, as expected, just raw grind. Distorted, primitive guitars, fuzz bass, oppressive drums, grizzly vocals. Yet with enough structure to still feel thought-through amidst the chaotic riffs and blast beats. Slower sections offer some breathing room, and even the lyrics can be distinguished on rare occasions. Speaking of them, they are mostly what one would expect, dealing mostly with big corporates, government control and exploitation of the poor and the Earth alike. Two tracks that stand out are the surprisingly well structured Siege of Power, spanning just over four minutes, and the closing (in)famous You Suffer, its exact opposite.\n\nNow comes the part where you flip the LP, if you have one. Hold onto your hats because you're in for a big surprise, and I'll leave it up to you whether it's a pleasant one. Not for me, sadly. The overall sound settles much more in the lower frequencies, due to multiple reasons. The guitars have a more \"grinding\" tone to them, with the less audible overdriven bass supporting underneath. The hi-hats no longer sound particularly crisp, either. A major shift happened in the vocal section, too, which is now more akin to the classic death metal growl and even the little signs of actual words are pretty much absent. \n\nAs to what has stayed or changed for the better, the unique feel of primordial grind is still very much present, albeit in a much less dynamic sounding package than what the first side had to offer. Those who care about lyrics and look them up will find out they naturally follow the spirit of side A, but feel less straighforward and more thought out. As for the guitar work, I find it more than respectable, with some great riffs and groovy sections. If it existed alone, few would say that the side B is somehow inferior. As it stands, I consider it weaker, but not by a huge margin.\n\nOverall, this record remains an undisputable classic of early grind \u2013 coarse, dirty, imperfect but undeniably influential.\n",
        "\nEDIT: When I first wrote this review then I thought that this review is terribly inconsistent and a bit hard to understand. So I decided to edit it a bit and I hope that now it is better to understand for everyone. I probably didn't need to write this paragraph but I'm going to keep it anyway, because I might as well, you know?\n\nWhen it comes to grindcore people usually start off with this album. But I think that is for the wrong reasons. It seems (to me at least) that people are claiming this the first grindcore album mainly because of the A side. But I personally think the B side of this rules more than the A side, and I also think that F.E.T.O. (\"From Enslavement To Obliteration\" for those who don't know grind as well as I do) is the album that really defined grindcore. \"Scum\" might have started it, but ND's next album is really where the genre really broke new grounds.\n\nThe A side is different from the B side. Everybody already knows this. The A side was actually intended to be a part of a split record with the hardcore band Atavistic at first, and it was eventually scrapped, for some reason. But then, people (either Earache or the band) decided to include that recording with this album. I think that's a bit of a shame, because I think the production value on that side would've been a lot better, if they just re-recorded it. And I firmly believe that this is the reason people claim this album to be inconsistent. Now enough of me explaining my opinions! Let's get to the actual music! But for that I have to explain each side separately.\n\nOkay, starting off with the A side, this was originally recorded as a demo. You can even tell on the actual album that this sounds like a demo. The guitars here sound pretty nice and heavy, and there's more solos here than on the B side. Also, the solos on this side are more of mocking glam metal solos, and there also aren't that many of them here. The drums are nice and punchy, but also they're pretty sloppy, seems that Mick was not quite in his drumming prime yet. The bass is more often revealed here and can actually be heard underneath the other instruments. Some people say it sounds like the bass on Repulsion's \"Horrified\" (a.k.a. \"Slaughter of the Innocent\"), but the bass there was more fizzy, here it sounds like complete sludge, in a very good way. Nik's and Justin's vocals are more like barks than anything else, and they don't really evolve, which makes it a bit of a bummer. But again, this side has still got lots of punk in it so it really doesn't matter, the B side is where shit really goes down (downtown!). The riffs are very much punk and don't really have much else going for them, besides a few thrash riffs, but that doesn't make them crap, and they don't repeat themselves too much either. Personally I think the A side is brought down by the production and the sloppiness of the band, and also the lack of lyrics. The B side was sloppy too, but at least there they managed to get a hang of things. All songs on this side in my opinion were good, but the songs that are kind of boring are \"Caught in a Dream\", \"Polluted Minds\", and \"Born on Your Knees\". The other songs are good. Not brilliant, but good. I wouldn't claim \"Multinational Corporations\" to be a song though, personally I think it's rather the intro track to the album. And also this side features the infamous \"You Suffer\". I will NOT get deeper into that. That has been done millions of times before.\n\nThe B side. THIS is where the band REALLY found their potential. Kicking off things with \"Life?\" and BANG! We are in for some pure fucking skull cracking, rib smashing, bone crushing GRINDCORE! This side is WAY more groundbreaking than the A side. Yeah, the year is 1987 so it sounds a tad bit shit, but it still has the soul and power that was possible around the time. The guitar is less heavy, but sounds a lot better and ominous than on the A side. There's also practically no solos, except for \"Parasites\", and it sounds rather intentionally shitty. Or Bill just didn't know yet how to play a solo, or better yet write one. The bass here is less revealing itself, and it's also a bit weaker. It's kind of fuzzy, but also low-end friendly, it does get buried in the mix, but at least it does a decent job at supporting the guitars. I do also have to compliment Jim's lyricism. Later on that though. The drums are way more consistent, and Mick Harris (who was featured on both sides) can blast faster here than he could on the A side. He managed to improve a lot in 8 months! Yes, that was the time between both of the recording sessions! The vocals here, delivered by the future Cathedral frontman, Lee Dorrian, are more of punk based yells than his distinct future growls. But the growls are still here too (occasionally) and this side also appears to have shrieks unlike the A side. Now look, I don't have a problem with the A side of this album, but I just want to get the differences between the two sides out of the way as much as I can. Back to the music. The production is also really good here, again, better than A side (I can see this becoming a joke), but maybe not keen enough of the low-end, but it does sound more serious, and more like an album. This side however SMASHES the A side, not because it sucked, but because the production and musicianship was inferior to the B side. The riffs this time are mostly death/thrash oriented riffs, but the punk riffs occasionally tend to slip themselves in here too. Again, they're not repetitive, so if you're all about riffs, this album has them. All the songs on this side are pretty great. The less great tracks are \"Point of No Return\", \"Negative Approach\", \"Pseudo Youth\", \"As the Machine Rolls On\", \"Common Enemy\", and \"M.A.D.\". Otherwise these songs are brilliant.\n\nLet's dissect the lyrics a bit. The lyrics here are more of anti-capitalist, sociopolitical commentary that was making huge rounds in the thrash and hardcore punk scene in the 80s. The A side's lyrics are more cheesy (at least in the way of phrasing), whilst the B side's lyrics seem to be more thought through and sophisticated. The A side seems to have lyrics that are telling the point of the lyrics out right away, while the lyrics on side B are trying to be more poetic and more thought-provoking, and actually sound more intelligent. You might not care about this too much, but personally I look deeper into song lyrics. So I just made an essay (I guess?) about the lyrics on this album, for those who look deeper into song lyrics as well.\n\nThis album might be viewed as inconsistent, but this review will probably get the same treatment! But one can only hope, right? I think this album is brilliant, but I don't think it defined the genre. That's next album. That doesn't mean THIS album isn't fun to listen to! Opposite, it's really fucking fun! From start to finish! I might have flamed the A side of this, but it still is great. I personally just prefer side B. And I think people should look a bit deeper into the B side too. Again, not that the A side sucked, but because the B side is overlooked in my opinion.\n\nThis is a landmark in grindcore, it is a classic, a masterpiece, JUST not the greatest thing ever. If you want to get into grindcore, find new music to listen to, or just looking for something to listen to because you don't have anything smarter to do, then by all means, check this album out! This has got energy, anger and pure headbanging tendencies going on through-out the entire thing. You will definitely not regret listening to this. I'm confident anyone who is okay with a bit of inconsistency will enjoy this.\n\nAnd that's it. I have nothing more to say here. Except one old stanza...  EXCEPT THE END! ACCEPT THE END? \n",
        "\nThe 90s was a strange time for Napalm Death and metal as a whole.\nWith a surge of alt/nu metal bands beginning their global takeover, record labels were increasing their pressure on old school, extreme metal bands to make their music more accessible for the masses. This is probably the reason you see so many 80s bands have such a hit or miss mid career in terms of their discography. Unlike many bands however, Napalm Death were still able to crank out some super solid releases that retained the heaviness of the past whilst incorporating influences of the 90s bands that were so successful at the time. \n\n\"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\", which i'll begin to abbreviate, begins an era for the band where there is less of a focus on chaotic blast beats and more of a focus on slower, pounding grooves and this would continue on for the next few releases (for better or worse). Within seconds of the album starting, we are greeted with a primal roar from vocalist Barney and a heavy, power chord driven groove immediately showing you this isn't the same band we had in the earlier releases. Riffs are mid tempo, but relentless in their structure, surrounding the listener in an envelope of sound. They have a savage quality to them that compliments the album's harrowing atmosphere perfectly and you can really see why the record is titled the way it is.\n\nThe production here is sludgy and murky, but I do not mean this in a bad way. The guitars are heavily downtuned, and produce a dark ambience that permeates the tracklist, making you feel like you are listening to this record in the sewer. The bass tends to stick to doubling on the guitar work, thickening the grooves in a tasteful way appropriate for the overall sound. Whilst anyone could definitely argue that Utopia and Harmony are superior records overall, I , for one, am happy that the band decided to deviate from the typical Scott Burns/Floridian death metal sound those albums equipped. It gives this record a memorable sound that makes it stand out in the colossal Napalm Death discography.\n\nI particularly love the vocals on this record, with Barney continuing the low death growl from Utopia Banished. They have a very particular, barbaric feel to them on this record that goes hand in hand with the, overall, dirty production. Barney sounds like an ancient demon, barking and howling at the microphone, and his vocals only increased in quality going forward. \n\nDespite all my praises however, there isn't much in the way of variance amongst the track list here, a quality that Napalm Death began to master in their later career. With a standard run time of just under 40 minutes, the record can start to become very one note towards the end, and the album can begin to drag as a whole. As the songs are generally a slower tempo than we are used to (with a few faster sections), the album essentially plods along at a very static pace, and i'm sure some people might not even make it to end because of it. \n\nAs an overall package, i'm very happy with this album. A turning point in the bands career and a vital part of the modern Napalm Death sound, \"FED\" delivers a 'to the point', straight forward package that is perfect for anyone looking for simple savage grooves to bang your head to. \n\nStand out tracks: \"Twist the Knife (Slowly)\", \"More than meets the eye\", \"Retching on the Dirt\"\n",
        "\nI want to start by saying I don't think Napalm Death has a truly 'bad' album. If anything, Napalm Death have one of the most consistently solid discographies of any band from their time period. However, one album has to come last and I don't even think its this one.\n\nDiatribes stands out in the ND discography, even amongst its other groove based brother albums, for having a unique sound that is unfortunately a bit of a departure from the ND everyone knew and loved. Carrying on what 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair' started, right from the get go we are greeted with a riff miles more melodic than what we are used to, and admittedly it sets the tone for the next 44 mins ahead. Gone are the blast beats from the past, Diatribes treats the listener with a sound all to much influenced by the growing nu metal and hardcore scene of the mid/late 90s. Whilst I wouldn't go as far to say that this album is a nu metal album through and through, its clear influence brings this record below the high standard we have come to expect from the band.\n\nSongs 'Greed Killing', 'Glimpse into Genocide' and 'Ripe for the Breaking' start the album off strong, with catchy hooks and grooves that, whatever your opinion on this album, are memorable and distinct enough to leave an impression. I particularly like the ending of 'Ripe for the Breaking', with its incredibly heavy breakdown after a small pause.\n\nSongwriting overall is more accessible than we have seen before, thanks to both the bands new sound and growing demand from the label to appeal to the masses. Songs have clear verses and chorus, a concept unimaginable for a grindcore band that previously blasted you for 30 seconds and that was it.\n\nWhere this album really shows its true self, is from 'Cursed to Crawl'.\n\n'Cursed to Crawl' is the band fully embracing the nu metal influence and centering its sound around rap verses dominated by a drum and bass beat. This sound dominates the record all the way through to the title track and, in my opinion, brings this album down from the niche pedestal it could have ruled in the ND catalog. The departure from classic ND is at its most here and whilst it is a bit too much for my ears, objectively the songs ARE well written and fulfill the intended desire quite nicely. If you was to disregard that this is a Napalm Death album and listen to it for its own merits, there is a decent groove, nu, death (lord knows what genre this is) record to be digested here.\n\nProduction wise, there isn't much to comment on here. The drums are as punchy as they should be, considering they accompany slower grooves as opposed to the turbo grind from before. The bass guitar can become a little lost in the mix when the album is at its fastest, but overall it has a funky clanky tone that compliments the drums and suits its often solo appearances. The guitar writing often leaves lots of space for the other instruments to breath so overall i'm pretty happy with the way they sound. As for the guitar tone, it is crunchy and serviceable but generic if anything.\n\nOverall, if i'm looking at the album as a package of its own merits, there is a lot to like about Diatribes that keeps it from being lumped with albums the likes of 'Illud Divinium Insanus' and 'St Anger'. It has a place in the history of Napalm Death that has always divided the fans of the band.\n\nThere is some truly memorable moments to be had here (both good and bad...) that, at the very least, warrants a listen from someone looking to experience the full development of Napalm Deaths modern sound, and how they mastered combining the best of all worlds in their later years.\n",
        "\nGuess it\u2019s nothing new that Napalm Death began as one of the most anarchic formations ever. But \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d showed first signs of a less individual sound and paid tribute to the rise of the death metal legions all around the world. \u201cMass Appeal Madness\u201d combines both worlds. On the B side are two new recordings from their second full-length and the riffing of \u201cUnchallenged Hate\u201d is definitely influenced by Sacrilege\u2019s raw debut \u201cBehind the Realms of Madness\u201d. The completely insane, hyper-hysterical whining reanimates the band\u2019s very early days and Barney\u2019s deep, pressed vocals fight a losing battle. However, this re-recorded song works like a stun gun \u2013 or just like many other pieces of Napalm Death in their very early days. Needless to say that the same goes for the 72 seconds outburst \u201cSocial Sterility\u201d.\n\nNaturally, the main focus was on the A side of the release. The title track is an almost complex piece with many great, unquestioning riffs, double bass attacks and a proper quantum of tempo shifts. Some screams echo every now and then through the inferno, while Barney spits out his lines with disgust. Sometimes bulky, sometimes in a surprisingly good flow, the song is absolutely convincing. \u201cPride Assassin\u201d does not deliver any form of weakness as well. This number is more straightforward and rolls over the listener with burning wheels. Both tracks cannot hide the fact that \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d had been released only one year before this EP. But okay, this had been a strong album and therefore I see no problem at all.\n\nThe quite massive production scores with a cool mix of sharp guitars and an almost dull sound base. The guitars and the voice dominate, but the rhythm section is not just a necessary accessory. The pretty stylish artwork reflects the more or less confusing yet brutal approach of the band and the lyrics are printed on the back cover. So what more could you ask for? Maybe a playtime that exceeds the nine minute mark, but come on, this is a grind-punk-death-hybrid, not an exercise in doom or progressive metal. Or to say it with Barney: \u201cMass appeal madness eats your brain\u201d and it is not the blame of Napalm Death that our miniature brains can be eaten that fast. And by the way, the short length builds a bridge to the 28 tracks / 33 minutes configuration of the debut. Even anarchists are reactionary enough to retain a remnant of their rebelliousness.\n",
        "\nThis EP is composed of 6 new original songs and 2 covers. What I liked the most about the originals is that they combine the heaviness of the groovy 90s Napalm Death with the full speed grindcore onslaught of their first records, without falling into the clich\u00e9s of either. 29 minutes are fairly long for an EP, it feels like a pretty complete record overall. There are some ambient passages that resemble Godflesh because of their industrial influence, especially on track 2 \u201cResentment Always Simmers\u201d but the covers feature some of that as well. \u201cPeople Pie\u201d, originally written by Slab! is technically funk, the bass is so downtuned and distorted it sounds like it's being slapped. \n\nIn terms of production I noticed that the drums aren\u2019t too loud and that helps the strings to stand out a lot more, all those dynamics. The album sounds very organic, despite the enormous amount of effects used on the strings, even the weird ambient noises sound like they were produced by actual instruments. I love how they managed to combine the punky riffing and guitar tone, ultra solid and consistent, with the overly distorted bass; generally it\u2019s the other way round, ultra thin and acidic guitars and a clean bass that sounds almost acoustic. They perfectly managed to turn around that mixing tendency.\n\nIn the vocal department we have Barney Greenway\u2019s traditional high-pitched yells but there are also a lot of low-ranged choirs done in clean vocals, like some sort of Gregorian Chant. The drumming is precisely what you can expect from Danny Herrera, completely methodic, not one single stroke is out of place or missing. Experimental passages on \u201cResentment is Always Siesmic - A Final Throw of Throes\u201d are so rough that the intensity of the regular blastbeat riddled sections is kept throughout the whole album. Mid paced sections are also heavy as fuck, in that sense I think this EP is more direct than its predecessor \u201cThroes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism\u201d. I loved that FL too, but I have to admit it was a pleasant surprise finding out that Napalm Death can still manage to release this ravenous level of grindcore.\n",
        "\nCalling Scum Napalm Death's debut album is only the ostensible truth. As is well-documented, the band who plays on the first half is almost completely different from that on the second half, the only exception being drummer Mick Harris. By that point, Napalm Death didn't even have any founding members left; over time, they would become one of those rare cases in music where the non-original members end up being the most recognizable line-up.\n\nScum is often derided by modern listeners as being inconsistent or haphazard - so this context is important. Rather than an LP, Scum must be seen as two albums from two different recording sessions almost a year apart. Not treating them this way invites the schizoid impression. The first side was originally released as a demo in August 1986, whereas the second half was recorded in May 1987. If anything, what we know as Napalm Death's first studio release is actually a demo with sixteen bonus tracks from a completely different session! The band saw that their entire 1987 recording fit on one side, and the label placed the original demo on the first half with no changes.\n\nWhat I'll call Scum 1 is full of grisly early death and thrash metal played to its logical extreme. Mick Harris called this style \"grindcore\" after Swans' debut album Filth, which he described to his bandmates as \"grind\". The side begins with a noise-esque intro that excoriates Thatcherite capitalism and waste - a theme that continues throughout the entire release through Nik Napalm's barks. It exudes dust and grime, with the bassy intro to the title track and the chaotic grooves on \"Sacrificed\" and \"Siege of Power\" showing to great effect. Justin Broadrick plays guitars - yes, the Justin Broadrick of Jesu, Godflesh, and fifty other bands - and he is surprisingly on-par for someone who by his own admittance couldn't play guitar before joining and was barely out of his mid-teens by the time of recording. Lots of Scum 1 features a rolling approach to riffs that demonstrates that \"thrash and death on speed and speed\", which is emphasized by Mick Harris's tapping of the hi-hats before launching into quadruple-speed. There's an interesting amount of restraint beforehand, rather than the gonads-forward kind of grindcore with which the band is now inseparable.\n\nSide 2 is completely different - as to be expected when a band completely shakes up its members. Gone is the bass-heaviness and spacious, slightly reverbed first half. Scum 2 more fittingly bares the term \"grind\", as the guitars sound like they've been turned up high at the expense of most other instruments and have a crunchy sound like grinding gears (of big business, perhaps?). Lee Dorrian's screeches greatly contrast with Nik Napalm's comparatively low pitch, and Harris's drumming is like the first half sans the slow, groovy parts. Bill Steer's cacophonous solos have the \"can they actually play?\" aesthetic of early Kreator, which might surprise those who only know his melodic death metal output as a founding member of Carcass (yet shock nobody who's familiar with the band's early work).\n\nScum 2 is generally thought of as the weaker side. I don't think this is fair. They are two different albums that just so happen to share the same vinyl or tape. The juxtaposition is even weirder when it's a CD, as the act of manually turning over the vinyl doesn't happen and \"You Suffer\" (a good closer in its own right) immediately flips into the roaring \"Life\".\n\nI encourage new and old listeners to listen to the two sides separately and treat them as such. When experienced that way, their strengths independently stand out instead of in contrast to each other.\n\nOriginally posted to RateYourMusic. Edited for Metal Archives.\n",
        "\nA more experimental Napalm though I still like it. It's kind of the same way I like Chaos AD by Sepultura though they're in a whole different genre. But the same idea. I think that they had a lot of good ideas in the songwriting but they totally abandoned their grind roots on here. Surprised that Jesse (RIP) did go through and play on this alongside Mitch. I supposed \"slowed down\" doesn't even come close to this one. I like it, but it's way not Napalm. If they wanted to abolish their metal roots (as I say), then they've done that here. It's kind of like Napalm meets Lamb of God or Killswitch Engage. I'm surprised that I like this!\n\nI can see an alternative metal approach on Diatribes it's closest to that genre far away what Napalm fans are really into. But since I value just about all genres I can appreciate this and give it a \"B\" rating. They probably wanted to do something they've never done and well that's what they sure as hell did. I like the guitar riffs on a lot of their songs here but you would think it's not Mitch and Jesse doing this. And Barney sounds the same just not like on Harmony Corruption, Utopia Banished or Fear, Emptiness, Despair. This is the newer Barney not as low in pitch nor as likeable (to me) as on earlier releases the ones I just mentioned.\n\nI think if this were a different band then grind, death/grind or straight death metal you'd probably be OK with it. I suppose that they did see the negative press so they changed their tune. I'm still in favor of people getting the album but just expect something different. Those blast beats are nonexistent and the intensity is a lot less. They probably don't really play much of the material on this live (they didn't when I saw them in 2012), so it's not well received. There are a lot of changes on here and the distortion on the heavy riffs are there but not on every song the whole way through.\n\nIt's hit or miss if you'll like this or not. Since I'm a big Napalm fan, I accepted that it was something different here so I thought it palatable for me. But if you're looking to the utmost intense Napalm search into the earlier releases I mentioned or with the old lineup. Don't expect Napalm of the old this is the new generation. Though on here, it's pretty alternative metal sounding. They abdicated their roots but a lot of songs are still pretty strong! I ordered the CD because I didn't get it when it came out in '96. I've been a Napalm fan since the late 80's. I've heard a big change in sound and this is a product of the new.\n",
        "\nI think this is a solid release as well as line-up. Except for the fact that they don't have Mick Harris anymore. He seemed to be the driving force when it came to grindcore. But Napalm changed into more of a death metal band than grind. This is a solid release nevertheless. It's got both elements to it: grind and death metal. The energy is high up there and the riffs are mind boggling. This is another newer generation of Napalm that I like. A lot of their newer material is OK but I prefer the old. This has a good sound to it and vibe. I think old school Barney is the best but he's doing good on here as well.\n\nThe music is the highlight of this album and I did enjoy pretty much all the tracks. Mitch's vocals are a little annoying though, but it brings back Mick to old Napalm. I felt that the bulk of the songs had a good structure to them and the guitar tone was appropriate. They were fortunate that Jesse (RIP) was still with the band at this point. I always liked him with the band. I think after Harmony Corruption the band experienced a fall in their energy (Mick). They've just changed when he left and turned more towards death metal than grind. Not that that's bad, but maybe change their name, I'm not sure.\n\nThe guitars sound like they're tuned pretty low hence their thick sound. Really keeping it underground they are and Danny has some wicked drum tracks though it sounds like he's using triggers. That's not bad just has to keep up with the rhythms! I guess I just like the old school Napalm though I do think a lot of their newer stuff is palatable. But yeah, they should've changed their name. However, there are a lot of good moments to this album. Nothing that sticks as well as the old but still, it is quality. Barney isn't as low on the growls as he was on Harmony Corruption or Fear, Emptiness, Despair.\n\nThis album is almost 20 years old, but it's still on the good side of Napalm. The main members were with the band on here (Barney, Jesse, Mitch and Shane). I don't know what happened to the last track on this album but all the songs are pretty strong! I decided to buy the CD after hearing this digitally. Mind you, I still collect CD's. It was worth getting, wholeheartedly! The energy and fire is still there on this one it'll just never amount to Harmony Corruption. That one was filled with death/grind glory! Still, an excellent effort on this one. They have shown the metal community fresh new riffs! Check it!\n",
        "\nArt is the psyche of the artist conveyed into a medium, and from there, most of the time, to the appreciators of the art. Very often, great high art embraces themes of romantic emotions and invokes an impression of beauty in the appreciator, or in the case of music, the listener. Napalm Death's \"Scum\" is the closest that hardcore music has gotten to high art. In \"Scum,\" Napalm Death expresses themes of intense political and social critique, as the great French philosopher Guy Debord has once implied that any piece of art must do so to be considered \"great.\" They, however, didn't achieve this with romantic textures that convey hefty emotions to the listener in a cold or warm atmosphere of artistic beauty, Napalm Death did the exact opposite. Instead, they've created the perfect impression of the hell world they're very accurately describing in this album in the best way possible: With extreme abrasiveness and intense aggression. Considering the nature of Justin Broadrick and Nik Napalm's later works, this album probably could've been much more sophisticated than it is, but they deliberately avoided that path. For the best.\n\n\"MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS. GENOCIDE OF THE STARVING NATIONS.\"\n\nThe album starts off with its only non-chaotic section, the intro, \"Multinational Corporations.\" The scraping sonic experimentation creates a hellish atmosphere, and it sets the mood for the album perfectly together with the rough spoken word track. From there, it smoothly segues into the endless chaos of the A-side of the album. \"Instinct of Survival\" and the following tracks establish the uncompromising, sheer brutality of the album, jumping from one intense riff to another, never staying in one theme. Nothing feels out of place, and the album flows very smoothly, never losing momentum. While great in quantity, all the songs longer than one minute in here are inherently unique, too. \"Control\" and \"Siege of Power\" are my favourites here. \"Control\" has the other and last section of sonic experimentation in the album, haunting the listener and finally perfectly and fully setting the \"hell world\" theme. The band should've expanded upon this with their follow-up record instead of creating \"Scum B-Side, II.\" \"Siege of Power\" is essentially an example of what a full-length song sounds like in the true Napalm Death style and also is the second peak of the creativity in the riffs after the title track.\n\n\"YOU SUFFER, BUT WHY?\"\n\nAnd then the A-side of the album, the legendary masterpiece that forever changed the metal and hardcore landscape, with many other opuses created in its vein, ends. Upon flipping the record, you're met with the nu-Napalm Death. The reason it's so drastically different and much weaker than the A-side is that it was performed by a new roster of musicians after Nik Napalm and Justin Broadrick both departed in the middle of the making of this album. While I can appreciate that they were at least faithful to the style of the other half of this record, their attempt at imitating it is unsuccessful and rather weak, both musically and artistically. The perfect flow of the album is disrupted several times in the B-side, with the riffs not being as characteristic nor as brutal. It feels like they were trying to forcibly create fifteen minutes of material so that they could release this as a full-length record. Even the otherwise masterfully written lyrics are slightly degenerated, with songs like \"Conservative Shithead\" or \"Stigmatized\" playing juvenile tribalism instead of trying to unite the people against the menace destroying our society. Overall, though, it's not offensively bad. I still give it a spin every once in a while if I feel like it.\n\n\"...EXCEPT THE END - ACCEPT THE END?\"\n\n\"Scum\" is an album that's much unlike most of what it influenced. It's something that most albums of similar nature don't even come close to, it's art. It challenged musical conventions of creating an impression. It challenged the theme of \"rebellious\" music, with the most mature and truthful political and social critiques ever written as lyrics that are within it. This album is a true masterpiece of legendary stature.\n",
        "\nWithin a different realm here with once pure \"grind\", but now death/grind pioneers, Napalm Death is back with in my estimation a technical, diverse, intriguing, illustrious and brutally diverse intense release. They, simply put DOMINATE in respect to the music and the variety. They're incorporating a lot of diversity here on this new one showing that they're still kicking ass even after over 30+ years since they were originally founded! By no way are they putting out material that is repetitious. On \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\", Napalm has technical guitar riffs showing here, some drop down tuning and such original music in all aspects. They've combined some of the \"old\" sound in respect to the vocals i.e. Barney showing a change in his style than what he once was and Mitch on background vocal screams. It makes it more listenable with variety.\n\nAll 14 tracks dominate! The music, production, vocals and intensity is all there. This is one of my favorite ND releases besides \"Harmony Corruption\" and the live album \"Live Corruption\" way back in the early 90's. This band is still kicking major butt because they're incorporating many different sounds musically and it's loud as all hell. It's alright that there are no original members since they were founded -- Shane Embury on bass is probably the eldest contributor, Barney and Mitch with the band for over 20 years and Danny took over on drums ever since Mick Harris left the band in 1991. They've really gone through musical evolution over the years, but still reign high as this one exceeded my expectations!\n\nYou have tempos here that very from slow, medium, fast then hyper-fast speeds -- they're covering it all! These guys especially Mitch and Shane did some great riff writing no doubt -- they both made the music highly well conducted as they used a lot more higher end concoctions of technical morbidity musically yet still tuned the guitars it seems lower than D-tuning for this as well as filled the album with precision. There was only I think 1 lead guitar part -- the rest just plain obliteration to the eardrums. Mitch and Shane were all over the fretboard here -- you get bar chords, tremolo picking riffs and intensity hands down! The vocal variations also make the album very diverse and intriguing. Barney no is not the same man on vocals as he was when he joined. He is yelling mostly while Mitch's backup screams keep the music flowing.\n\nVery well produced album! I liked the fact that they really did cover every musical avenue here when creating the music for this one. They really hit home with their creativity and even though old Napalm is dead and different from what they originally were doing in the earlier days to what they're doing now, I still think that this album is musical perfect in death/grind. Danny isn't as tight on drums than when Mick was with the band, but he's definitely a solid drummer and compliments the bands compositions quit well. Mick was more of a leader type of person when he was with Napalm, but Danny definitely did his part well on this release. He might not be as creative and tight as Mick was, but he's stuck with the band for over 20 years also!\n\nShould you be excited with Napalm's latest? My words are: HELL YES! This band takes all of these musical avenues and turns metal into a whole new avenue with all that makes a perfect score album complete: brutality, originality, diversity and intensity along with a solid production quality. These guys deserve praise with this one because it's I think their best one out since \"Words From The Exit Womb\" was released! They simply annihilate here and there's no doubt that it was by no stretch of chance that they were one of the Billboard's top releases for this year! YouTube this and listen for yourself. Interesting song titles and still yes the politically based lyrical concepts haven't escaped them! Get the album if you want to hear some top metal from this year so far. This one destroys!\n",
        "\nThis release is charged with hatred amazing they pulled it off. I didn't like this in the beginning because it's so different from their older material. By older I mean when Barney first joined the band via 'Harmony Corruption'. I just need to again get used to all the screaming because there's no burly vocals like in the past even on 'Utopia Banished' and 'Fear Emptiness Despair'. Those were the good days (to me). It's a matter of getting used to the 21st century Napalm. This one is charged with blisteringly fast guitar work though they change it up some songs are just slow and seem out of place.\n\nI think the energy here is great! I don't mind this album, it's a more modern Napalm with all the screaming and aggression. Mitch (I believe) does some vocals on here as well. The whole band does a good job on here, it's just not what I expected. But it's a good follow-up from 'Apex Predator - Easy Meat'. That's another really loud one with insane vocals and noise terror. Both this one and their last has this great energy to them. Just take out the useless songs. Some tracks however sound like 'From Enslavement To Obliteration' but the screaming is higher pitched and the guitars are more tranquil. \n\nThe music on here is quite unique the guitar sounds great. Just the vocals take some getting used to. I liked all the tracks that weren't slow and like I said out of place for this release. That's my only beef with the album. Other than that, the axe is amazing. Mitch does a great job with the compositions. Him and Shane are fantastic. I think this newer voice of Barney needs adjustment. I haven't heard him sound like his old self since his early days with the band (as I mentioned). He needs to go back to his roots with Benediction and early Napalm while they were just getting established. And say on the live album 'Live Corruption'.\n\nI thought that the production quality was top notch. Everything you could hear rather well. I wouldn't change anything in that respect. This new generation of the band with no original members left except Shane (way early on) is sort of reinventing their sound. It's mainly death/grind with all screaming. It isn't as much of grind since Danny cannot play nearly as good as Mick Harris was with the blast beating. Mick pretty much founded the grindcore drumming. Danny has never been really strong in terms of blasts, I also admired Mick's creativity. It's too bad he didn't stick with the band I think he's in Scorn now.\n\nThe songs with main guitars were phenomenal. The energy on here is amazing. I ordered this album, but I first heard it on Spotify. You can check it out there or on YouTube (I believe). It's worth getting the album, what a release! I loved the guitars the most and a hell of a lot of screaming between Barney and Mitch! The intensity! It only gets better as the album progresses. If you're a Napalm fan, especially the newer Napalm, you'll like this. And even though I'm a longtime fan throughout their discography, this one definitely needs to be checked out! Get it on CD and show support to the music industry!\n",
        "\nIt's a bit weird to talk about how shitty this shitty album is considering how much shittier this band got with each subsequent album, and it's kind of a situation like with a band like Def Leppard that yeah once they turn shit, they really get shittier and shitter, but it's the moment they first turn to shit that's really the shittiest because it hits the hardest, because up until that point they were something and could have been something more and they just went nah fuck it, let's just do what everybody else is doing except maybe more harmless.\n\nIn that respect Harmony Corruption is probably as suck as it gets, because here you got a band that innovated just about everything, at least in name, not in line-up, everybody with talent has left at this point and formed influential bands of their own innovating industrial metal and goregrind and stoner doom, you got the name at least and some people using it, a name associated with breaking about a dozen hundred thousand musical boundaries to this point, and so they got no more ideas, but got the guy from Benediction, so they wanna sound like Benediction without any of the cool riffs and just really tired and probably on benzodiazepines but still pretend it's grindcore somehow because the drums are really fast. \n\nYes every paragraph is one run on sentence and I don't remember how they started when I hit full stop which is a meta reference to the songwriting on this album, nobody really gives a flying fuck. It's grindcore, there are fast drums, the people playing guitar and bass don't give a shit about anything in terms of riffs, and Barney sounds as fucking ridiculous as he always did sounding less death metal than the actual Sesame Street Cookie Monster and just talking like he's really surprised all the time. \"Ooooooh! I'm so surpriiiiiiiiised! With my voice raaaaaaising randomly or at the end of a senteeeeeence!\" What band wouldn't want to replace him with the cool ass voice of Dave Ingram, dunno why fake Napalm Death never thought of it, maybe because they lack the riffs to back up a cool singer.\n\nI dunno, this fake band's fake career seems to go on forever, and somehow there are people who care, it's obviously not Napalm Death, and it's obviously a dumbass imitation of how Benediction regretted not finding Dave Ingram earlier so they could record Transcend the Rubicon instead of wasting their energy on someone ruining their music on someone making a complete ass of himself all over it with his hopefully unintentional comedy. For fake Napalm Death that's somehow their goal in life ever since everybody with actual talent left the band and formed Godflesh and Carcass and Scorn and Cathedral and all, gotta do Subconscious Terror without riffs. Over and over again. But like Def Leppard, who cares about them doing it all over again, it's not like anyone serious about the band ever listened to anything after this, because after this pointless vomit, who gives a fuck.\n\nJust for the sake of completion the production is also shit and sounds like some low budget mid 90s death metal accident some label wasted money on trying to follow the death metal hype rather than unhinged grindcore mayhem that would influence thousands of bands, and the political lyrics don't say anything anybody ever would care about in a way everybody would care about even less, but that's just for the sake of completion because ten seconds into listening to this you'll already know there will be nothing worth anything without having to explore the details. Why even use the name of a band you got nothing to do with for this kind of shit?\n",
        "\nTo introduce Napalm Death would be carrying coals to Newcastle. This is especially true because their sixteenth studio album spits on experiments and one still wonders how aggressive and enthusiastic these old boys are. Those \"metal\" fans who never liked the band will also hate \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\". Anyway, these guys have no clue. Napalm Death still mix their unique cocktail of chaotic, anarchic, hyperventilating and sometimes ponderous lines and rhythms. 98% of the non-metallic part of mankind will say that \"Napalm Death\" is the shortest definition of everything that cannot be described as music. Yet we, the experts of good music taste, know it better. The formation from Birmingham has created its own acoustic universe, definitely noisy, revolutionary and totally uncompromising, but exciting at the same time.\n\nAs always, it is not easy to realize that the chaos is based on a solid structure. Blast beats, animalistic screams and sawing guitars shape an almost indecipherable code of terror. The entire album appears as a bloody lump of meat which is as appetising as the meat on the album cover. It needs some time to figure out individual features of the single songs, but Napalm Death deliver a certain degree of variation. \"Hierarchies\", for example, starts with some rumbling lines that roll out the carpet for Barney's inhuman articulation. Rather slow, but hostile as hell. Anyway, suddenly an almost \"normally\" singing choir shows up and proves evidence that Napalm Death are able to write interesting melodies. They just do not like to do so. Just as a friendly reminder, this is Napalm Death, not Europe. \"Dead Slum Landlord\", to name another example, is rather a desperate intermezzo than a regular song. Its fairly melodic parts dominate and convey a slightly surrealistic mood. But don't be fooled. It goes without saying that the ferocious full-length is mainly characterized by the erratic and aggressive vandalism of the British dudes. Brutality is a pleasure as long as no one gets hurt.\n\nOf course, this musical approach needs a vehement sound and therefore I appreciate the fact that \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\" does not lack pressure, transparency and harshness. This mixture creates a truly demonic impression. The constantly attacking guitar leaves a trail of devastation and I bet that no fan of the band's former releases will be disappointed. Quite the opposite, the orgiastic violence of the musicians convinces with its irresistibility. Just listen to explosive outbursts such as the slowly starting \"Timeless Flogging\" which turns out to be a real sledgehammer. Or do you like to enjoy \"Bloodless Coup\" with its mercilessly shredding riff at the beginning? Give yourself time to identify your highlights of a full-length with an even quality level. I admit that outputs of Napalm Death always leave me slightly disturbed and I am not able to say which one is the best of their albums. Yet I know that the here reviewed work is a strong piece of extreme metal. Not each and every track is a killer, but the vast majority of them celebrate a violent feast. There are not so many bands out there that are able to record such an intensive sixteenth album.\n",
        "\nDuring Napalm Death\u2019s death metal years in the early 90\u2019s, Earache had them releasing singles, EPs, and other small releases between albums. During the writing of \u201cUtopia Banished,\u201d Napalm Death made sure to write a bunch of additional songs, something that wasn\u2019t a problem, as they were on fire in the writing department, especially with the addition of new drummer Danny Herrera. Bassist Shane Embury has said something that he forgets how to play a lot of these extra tracks since they wrote so many, but that doesn\u2019t mean these songs are just just discarded album material.\n\nFirst and foremost, if you don\u2019t like \u201cUtopia Banished,\u201d then the songs on this EP won\u2019t do it for you either. Out of the three tracks, one is a re-recording from that album, and the other two are exclusive tracks. They opted to record the three songs at a different studio with a different producer than \u201cUtopia Banished,\u201d so the production is a little different. It\u2019s a little more airy, especially with the guitars, but it\u2019s not a glaring difference. The title tracks differs from the album version slightly \u2013 it contains a bit of an intro with some samples, and the backup vocals are a little more prominent. The song itself has a really cool death metal groove with blasting section in the middle, and is a classic song of the band\u2019s death metal era.\n\nThe two exclusive tracks presented here are also rather enjoyable. \u201cA Means to an End\u201d has a pretty groovy UK death metal riff that\u2019s got a nice amount of speed, but generally also has a lot of speed with interesting riff patterns that get into some punk territory too. Meanwhile, \u201cInsanity Excursion\u201d is a lot more straight forward, as it alternates between blasts and fast thrash beats for its 2 minute duration. Again, the riffs are interesting enough, but I\u2019m sure a song like this was delegated to the \u201cnon album material\u201d bin due to its simplicity.\n\nDo you need this EP in your collection? Unless you\u2019re a diehard Napalm Death fan that has to collect all their releases, it\u2019s not something you need to hunt down. Thankfully, the two exclusive tracks are available on the extended edition of \u201cUtopia Banished,\u201d along with another 4 bonus tracks, making it a 21 track album. If you really want to hunt down the version of the title track that\u2019s on this EP, it appears on the \u201cNoise for Music\u2019s Sake\u201d compilation. I would certainly pick up the stand alone EP if I found it for cheap, as the artwork has always been striking, but I\u2019m in no rush to hunt for it.\n",
        "\nIf this isn't the best grindcore album ever, I don't know what the hell is. I've been in love with Napalm Death's almighty second effort From Enslavement to Obliteration since the minute I first heard it. I like most Napalm Death albums, but this one is definitely my favorite. Scum will never ever amount to this. Enslavement is far too superior.\n\nThe main reason why this is such a fantastic release is because of it's sound and structure, it's flawless. The drums sound amazing, the snare is thick and has such a great sound to it. Same thing goes for the kick drum. I really appreciate the drums' sound on this, whoever is responsible for making them sound the way they do, thank you so much because it's so PERFECT. The drumming itself is furious, fast, and rambunctious as hell. On some parts he slows down, or plays a mid paced-fast pocket beat, or blast beats the fuck out of your eardrums. Mick Harris' drumming is absolutely relentless, and I appreciate that he throws in more stuff in his playing, than just blast beats over and over, to give a little bit of variety to this grindcore album. Most noticeably in the opening track, there's no furious grindcore drumming just yet, he slows down for a little and feels the groove before releasing the beast on It's A M.A.N.S. World.\n\nHonestly, I probably wouldn't care for this at all if the drums sounded any different. That factor alone is what makes this album so magnificent. But obviously that cant be the ONLY reason why I love it. The guitars are similar to the drums, also having such a thick and rich sound that sounds fantastic. The drums and guitar work in perfect harmony together, such a fantastic mixture. The riffs themselves are also quite a treat. This may be a grindcore album, but the riffs are most definitely differentiable, and you can tell which song is which. Songs like It's A M.A.N.S. World and the title track are some prime examples, you know which riff/song is which. Grindcore is a genre where most of the songs are under a minute and most of them sound indistinguishable, and the great thing about From Enslavement to Obliteration is that they ingrain every separate track into your brain no matter the length, so this serves as a more memorable \"grindcore\" album overall. You know the songs one from another, rather than knowing just the album overall, if that makes any sense.\n\nLee Dorian's vocal work is quite the thing as well. He can do some ridiculous and nasty screams, growls, shouting, you name it. This man truly is a beast behind the microphone, he can spit out some good shit. Even though he was only present on two of the band's full lengths, he still did a great job and is still loved by fans. Scum is still popular among listeners these days, as well as Enslavement, but more Scum, as it's more monumental. Shane's bass is incredible. It's your trademark static and very fuzzy sounding bass, but the man knows how to put it in it's place. Enslavement is an album filled to the brim with bass and a thick sound, and Shane's bass does nothing but make it sound even better. Parts where fast playing suddenly stops and the bass shines alone for a few seconds, or when a song starts off with the fuzzy bass for a few seconds, they're so great, it's a big time giant eargasm and couldn't be any better. I'm also a pretty big fan of the cover art, I think the colors they used are awesome. I like the nice shade of indigo along with the orange logo, with gray+black+white surrounding images that have some sort of deep meaning. Whoever pieced this together did it greatly, it's some eye candy; and it also fits very well with the music.\n\nIn my eyes, this album is very flawless and nothing short of perfect. This is the ideal Napalm Death release. A good amount of people prefer the more raw and frazzled sound of Scum, but I much more prefer the matured, improved, thick, and more thought-out sound of From Enslavement to Obliteration. Like I said before, the drums are the BEST THING about this album, enough said. If the drums sounded any different, this wouldn't be as magnificent as it is. It's the key thing that makes Enslavement perfect!!! Fantastic drums overall, awesome guitar sound, amazing bass, good songs that aren't too random and thrown all over the place, vocals with some variety, some pretty damn good cover art, I don't understand what isn't to love about From Enslavement to Obliteration. I enjoy the whole thing through whenever I listen to it, always makes me happy whenever I put it on. It's PERFECT and always will be forever. This is for sure the best thing ND has ever done. Undoubtedly one of my all time favorite albums.\n\nAbsolutely magnificent, a well deserved 100/100%.\n",
        "\nIt might be the longest gap between records in their career, but Napalm Death give off the vibe of unstoppability now more than ever before. Previous album, 2015's Apex Predator - Easy Meat, was almost the same amount of 'fucking awesome' as this new one, and definitely confirmed ND's indomitable attitude, but the shitstorm that is 2020 has no doubt had a part in creating what must be the Brits' most experimental offering yet. Experimental, yes, but still surprisingly consistent. The singles released before the album launch would've been incredibly brave choices for any other band, but Napalm seem to have garnered so much respect over the last 30 years that they're pretty much immune to such mortal quandaries. The experimental moments on the new LP, Throes Of Joy In The Jaws Of Defeatism, are merely the quartet letting their influences shine through. \n\nInitial opinions would be that this is more of the same. The first single, \"Backlash Just Because\", annihilating all in its path with an equal blend of upbeat punkish grindcore and mid-tempo death metal groove which has become ND's modus operandi over the last decade. Not that this would be a complaint; Embury and co. smash this kind of shit out with such professionalism and controlled chaos, and it's gold every time. Just check out the huge riff that slams down at the 2:04 mark. Combined with Barney's beautiful 'UuuuuaaaEEEGH!!', it's indicative of the power of which this band is capable. The first four tracks are classic, brutal, 21st century Napalm Death showing only hints of musical exploration; mainly through the 5/4 rhythms of \"Contagion\" or the batshit rhythm in the chorus of \"Fuck The Factoid\".\n\nIt's on track 5, \"Joie De Ne Pas Vivre\", where the listener's brows perk up and their eyes widen. This eerie, industrial clanger - with its haunting atmosphere, absence of melody and Barney's terrifically sneery performance - bears a striking resemblance to Killing Joke's \"Hosannas From The Basements Of Hell\". Speaking of Killing Joke, it's no secret that Barney is a fan - thus we end up with a track like \"Amoral\", which might as well have been penned by Jaz Coleman himself. \"Invigorating Clutch\", too, exhibits mid-paced, industrial traits - albeit with a more hammering approach. However, those songs pale in comparison to the direction taken on the album closer \"A Bellyful Of Salt And Spleen\". Following on in mood from the title-track of Apex Predator - Easy Meat, I can only describe it as a nigh-on-guitar-less, terrifyingly noisy doom-monger which is simultaneously haunting and shocking, with a video to match. These tracks all stray from the Napalm Death formula, and yet suit them down to the ground. This is remarkable stuff which, once again, pushes the envelope of grindcore.\n\nBarney is utterly on fire throughout TOJITJOD (my new favourite album acronym). His normal brutish bark is sounding more full than ever, but he's taking more risks and achieving more timbres than on any previous release. I hope I sound this commanding when I'm 51 years old. The production quality is superb, with Danny's drums sounding so much more precise on the blasts than on the previous few LPs, and Mitch's guitar retaining that enormously thick tone. The lyrics are more of Greenway's vague political skewerings, shrouded in metaphor and extensive vocabulary, yet bluntly obvious as to which side of the fence they sit. It may have only been over a month, but I probably won't have any issue declaring this as ND's best album ever. Let's face it, these guys could give synthwave a good go and we'd all lap it up, because it would undoubtedly be amazing. No longer simply a phenomenal band, Napalm Death are a national treasure, and Throes Of Joy In The Jaws Of Defeatism is the pinnacle of their achievements. So far.\n",
        "\nThis album has a lot of detractors from fans more attuned to the sound of Napalm Death's later efforts. Compared to their subsequent work, this debut sounds disorganized and cluttered. That's the point, raw aggression with as few frills as possible. None of Scum's detractors can discredit its influence. Widely considered the birth of grindcore, what Scum lacks in sophistication it makes up for in sheer exuberance. Lukewarm reviews of this album confound me. I'd expect reviews to be split between those calling it a classic, and those believing it to be an abomination on par with the worst atrocities ever committed by humans. Despite featuring two almost completely different lineups on each side, it's a remarkably cohesive and consistent collection of songs. If you dig the sound you should like the whole thing, if you don't, you should hate it.\n\nHowever, there are a few variations between the two sides. Of the two sides, Side A is the more musical of the two, containing coherent riffs that are easier to follow than those of the second side. The second side frequently drifts into highly politicized noise, but with a youthful energy that is impossible to deny. Side A is generally considered the best of the two, which I find interesting since their sophomore album (recorded by the Side B lineup with a new bass player) is frequently ranked as better than either side of Scum. Highlights include the Guinness Book of World Record winner for shortest song ever, \"You Suffer\", the grooving grind title track, and the pounding \"C.S.\" for a compelling drum sound.\n\nIf you're a fan of grindcore there's no reason you won't enjoy this album. It's prototypical, maybe even primitive in spots, but it feels as though a cheese grater is being run across your brain as you're listening to it. I presume that's the intended effect. It galvanizes me efficiently, and it should do the same for you if you're in tune with grindcore. Just don't expect melody, coherent structure, or any conceptual epic.\n",
        "\nA veritable law unto themselves for the best part of 40 years and counting, the pioneering, peerless fathers of grind, Napalm Death, are back with their 16th studio full-length, \u2018Throes Of Joy In The Jaws Of Defeatism\u2019. The five-year timespan between this landmark release and its predecessor, \u2018Apex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat\u2019 represents the longest gap between Napalm Death albums, but it has clearly been worth the wait as \u2018Throes Of Joy\u2026\u2019 is right up there with the UK underground legends\u2019 greatest achievements. And that\u2019s saying something!\n\nThe first thing that\u2019s noticeable here is that, despite their ominously advancing years (all now in their 50s), Napalm Death have lost none of their aggression or edge. To the contrary, the naked anger and rage that have characterised their trailblazing protest music down through the decades remains wholly intact \u2013 perhaps more focussed than ever \u2013 as opening assault \u2018Fuck The Factoid\u2019 rips through the speakers, confirming that we are in for another unruly helping of socially-conscious violent, brutal extremity. The title track is another suitably pulverising, discombobulating affair, as is \u2018Zero Gravitas Chamber\u2019 \u2013 and indeed the vast majority of the album \u2013 but there are some notable curveballs, too, that merit special mention\u2026\n\nNever afraid to experiment or to do whatever the fuck they please, Shane, Barney and Danny take us to unfamiliar terrain for \u2018Invigorating Clutch\u2019, \u2018Amoral\u2019 and the stunning, experimental closing shot, \u2018A Bellyful Of Salt And Spleen\u2019, paying tribute to an unlikely potpourri of bands like Swans, Killing Joke, Ministry, Amebix, Godflesh, Hawkwind and Meathook Seed \u2013 post-grind with an alternative, indie vibe delivered with power and panache in Napalm Death\u2019s inimitable style. Meanwhile, there\u2019s an almost electro feel to the wonderfully-titled \u2018Joie De Ne Pas Vivre\u2019, another song where Barney demonstrates impressive flexibility in his vocal delivery.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of bass on \u2018Throes Of Joy In The Jaws Of Defeatism\u2019 and it\u2019s wonderfully composed and executed, giving me the impression that this is the most fun Shane has had in years working on a Napalm Death recording. Sensational drums and varied vocals are also very much to the fore, while the guitars do appear to have taken something of a backseat this time around, perhaps due to the fact that Mitch wasn\u2019t as involved in the process as he normally is.\n\nAll the songs are incredibly memorable and catchy, Napalm Death once more showcasing an uncanny ability to merge and mutate a myriad of musical styles into one seething, heaving, potent brew: 100% proof. Napalm Death is a unique musical force that has not only effortlessly stood the test of time but gone from strength to strength over the years. In my humble opinion, they are simply one of the most important bands in the history of music (of all genres).\n\nAs well as being ridiculously, paint-strippingly ferocious and caustic, ideal for letting off steam, their songs have also been a constant source of inspiration and enlightenment to me throughout my adult life. The combination of their vintage, neck-snapping, boot-stomping belligerence with the more adventurous approach displayed on the aforementioned, left-field tracks renders \u2018Throes Of Joy In The Jaws Of Defeatism\u2019 a stunning success and without doubt an album that all fans of extreme music need to hear.\n\nAs ever, the lyrics \u2013 such an essential aspect of the Napalm Death experience \u2013 are intelligent, thought-provoking and sobering \u2013 protesting prose and poetry put to music, socio-political commentary / observations pointing to the darker, inexcusable and frankly pathetic aspects of humanity, the system and everyday life. The refrain of \u2018Amoral\u2019, for example, that we are \u201cthe shit of the earth\u201d betrays a pent-up sense of fury and frustration at witnessing ad nauseam the same greed, corruption and mindless indulgences at the expense of others. Will things ever change? Can we learn or is it too late for redemption?\n\nThe great irony, of course, considering the inherently visceral and harsh nature of their music is that Napalm Death are such thoroughly decent, conscientious and outspoken human beings, tirelessly railing against ever-occurring, seemingly-endless injustices and inequality, lashing out fearlessly and unapologetically against morons and bullies everywhere, kicking against the pricks and standing up for the underdog. A beacon for the oppressed and cheated. They\u2019ve been doing it for so long now \u2013 and so well \u2013 that it would be all too easy to take them for granted.\n\nOriginally written for SwallowedInBlack.\n",
        "\nAs the 80's came to a close, grindcore pioneers Napalm Death were honing in on a more death metal oriented sound that came to fruition on their third album, \"Harmony Corruption.\" Preceding and following that album, the band had some shorter releases that showed the development of this new found death metal approach. \"Death by Manipulation\" compiles three EPs as well as a split 7\" into a single disc, which is certainly helpful for those who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on the original vinyl releases.\n\nThe compilation starts with four tracks from 1991's \"Mass Appeal Madness\" EP. Of the four tracks, three are brand new, and there's a re-recording of \"Unchallenged Hate\" from their second LP. The three new songs continue the style of Floridan death metal on \"Harmony Corruption,\" as it retains the same line up. The recording on here comparable to the aforementioned album, as it is still obviously going after the famed Scott Burns/Morrisound tones that so many death metal bands in the era used, but slightly darker in sound. These tracks are strong, and some have still made their way onto set lists in recent years.\n\nThe next three tracks are from the \"Suffer the Children\" EP which came out in 1990. This EP is really more of a single, as the title track is right off \"Harmony Corruption,\" and the other two songs are from the same session. \"Siege of Power\" is a song off \"Scum\" that's been re-recorded with a totally different middle section. It's got more of a death metal vibe than the original version, and manages to be the main attraction out of these three tracks. The song \"Harmony Corruption\" is an overly long interlude, and something I usually skip. Regardless, having these tracks on the disc is still nice.\n\nWithout a doubt, the highlight of this compilation are the six songs from 1989's \"Mentally Murdered\" EP. These are the first recordings where Napalm Death starts showing a lot more death metal influence, and it's performed by the same line up on the seminal \"From Enslavement to Obliteration\" album. As such, these songs truly do sound like they were crafted between the two albums. There's definitely that same unhinged grinding that rears its head, but it's put around death metal riffs in much more elaborate structures than Napalm has ever done before. Bill Steer's influence and skill are undoubtedly a part of this, as some of these riffs wouldn't sound out of place on Carcass' \"Symphonies of Sickness\" (which came out the same year). Lee Dorrian's vocals are absolutely brutal, and I think his performance on this EP set the tone for guys like Cryptopsy's Lord Worm in the coming years. Every song on here has excellent riffing, and you can tell the band is just bursting with creativity with their newly found death metal approach. The title track is a re-recording from the FETO album, and stands out as the grindiest on this recording. The last track, \"No Mental Effort,\" clocks in at 4 minutes, which is easily the longest Napalm Death song up to this point. \n\nIn contrast with the death metal material, the next six tracks come from Napalm Death's side of a split 7\" with Japanese grinders S.O.B. Again we have the FETO line up, but they're at full grinding force here. It opens up with a new version of \"Multinational Corporations,\" which sounds eerily similar to \"Half Life\" by no-wave band Swans. The next five tracks grind by in typical old school Napalm fashion, and they even included a 7 second micro-song. These tracks are honestly pretty good, but if you're only a fan of the grind era of Napalm Death, they hardly make buying this compilation worth it. I feel they're a welcome addition, as the original split is hard to find, and it's also the first material recorded after FETO, so it makes sense to include it.\n\nSome versions include three live bonus tracks from the \"Live Corruption\" album. These are kind of pointless, but at least they're decent enough sounding live tracks. It feels weird including them since it's not the full set, but some of the between song banter is amusing. I usually skip these tracks myself.\n\nThe amount of material packed in here is great, and I regularly listen to \"Death by Manipulation.\" It's a great way to own some crucial releases by the band without having to shell out lots of cash. As far as I'm concerned, Napalm Death from '88 to '91 is some of the most prime grindcore/death metal, and they really struck gold during the those transitional years.\n",
        "\nFive years have passed since the release of the last Napalm Death album. They've never had this long of a gap between albums, but considering this is their 16th album, it's not like fans don't have an excess of material to keep them occupied in the meantime. Between \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\" and now, a lot has happened in the Napalm Death world, and this can be felt on their newest record. \"Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism\" pushes in the same direction as their 2015 effort, but with more influence from post-punk and noise rock.\n\nThe increased usage of these post-punk and noise rock influences can be directly attributed to the absence of Mitch Harris' songwriting for this album. He only co-wrote one song, with everything else written by Shane Embury. Pretty much every Napalm Death album has been a sum of two or three main songwriters, with the Embury/Harris duo having a fairly even spread. Harris' death metal tremolo riffs and thrashy down-picked riffs are no where to be found. However, this doesn't translate into an album feeling like it's missing something. It feels like Embury purposely filled those gaps in by not trying to imitate Harris, but by expanding more on the dark, dirge-driven sounds that have always been present on their albums. Songs like \"Joie De Ne Pas Vivre,\" \"Invigorating Clutch,\" and especially \"A Belly Full of Salt and Spleen\" (the one Harris co-wrote) focus more on brooding atmospheres that you'd expect out of a no-wave record. Then you have songs like \"Amoral\" which seems to borrow a little more on the noise rock side, and it's really catchy.\n\nThe no-wave influences were to be expected, quite honestly, especially after the band put out a 7\" earlier this year with a Sonic Youth cover on it (which is also a bonus track on some editions of this). Of course, this album still has plenty of speed and intensity that you'd expect from Napalm Death. That's evident from the get go with the first handful of tracks. Embury's punkier songs are there, as are his grindier songs with some death metal influence. Overall, it makes for a very balanced album that is remarkably diverse but complementary to itself. With Embury writing the bulk of this record, and for it being as dynamic as it is, it only makes sense that it took them more time to write this. They very well could've just banged out a bunch of songs, but I think that really shows the amount of care that went into it.\n\nThe production is great. Russ Russell once again was responsible for engineering it, so there are no surprises in terms of sound compared to their last handful of records. He does a great job making the fast songs sound heavy and clear, as well as ensuring all the dark tones are preserved in all the left-field influences. The vocals at the beginning of the title track sound so perfect, and I couldn't imagine anyone else putting these records together for Napalm Death. Fans who only prefer their early grind years will probably scoff at how this record sounds, but that's their loss.\n\nI've seen a lot of people compare this record to \"Diatribes,\" which I think is a very poor comparison. The mid-90's Napalm Death focused more on groove, while this is obviously influenced by a lot of the strange music coming out in the 80's that the Napalm guys have always had an affinity for (especially since a lot of it was UK based), and there's still a fair amount of grind. With all this in mind, they've managed to put out yet another excellent record, showing that they can still sound fresh after almost 40 years of existence. Hopefully Mitch Harris is able to return to the band, as he's been an integral part of their songwriting for so many albums. Embury really pushed himself to make up for it, and even played half of the guitar tracks, making this a unique album in the vast Napalm Death discography.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death need no introduction, they are undeniable legen... just kidding, it won't be another one of these articles. Almost every extreme metal and hardcore fan knows that Napalm Death is the band responsible for the names such as \"grindcore\" and \"blastbeats\", Guinness Record Holders, favorites of Jim Carrey and an outfit with no founding members for more than 30 years. But what more people need to know is that these men's modern creations are way more than grindcore and death metal, even way more than metal and punk in general. These British gentlemen have been releasing music interesting, important and intense for many, many years. But none of their other modern records is as important and ambitious as Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism is.\n\nEverything about Napalm Death's sixteenth full-length album is very interesting and intriguing, including the title and the cover, elements that everyone sees first. In one interview Barney said that their new art should relate to current events, so the people could hook up to it. So in the title he used a clever oxymoron referring to the discrimination of minorities in the world, among others. The cover is portraying this idea very well and is one of the best album covers that I've seen this year so far. It kind of continues the path that Napalm took on Apex Predator - Easy Meat, but musically that album was more straightforward and more focused on grind.\n\nThe term that I always have in mind while listening to Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism is \"grindcold\". The music styles on the album are very diverse and the whole is really eclectic, but what is common to most of the songs are the cold guitar melodies here and there that remind of... yes, black metal! But most of these melancholic parts isn't black metal-inspired, but post punk-inspired and that reaches its climax in Amoral, an enormously catchy and magic song. The songs that the term \"grindcold\" fits the best are the first two: Fuck the Factoid and Backlash Just Because. Despite having a style pretty typical to Napalm Death, they stand out with this cold atmosphere and are very fresh and memorable. Fuck the Factoid is a perfect Napalm album opener. You expect the album to start in similar way it does, but still are surprised later.\n\nDuring the full spin the listener hears a catalog of the band's inspirations, for example: the main one, 80's hardcore punk (That Curse of Being in Thrall, Contagion), mentioned above post punk (Amoral and parts of many other songs) or industrial (Joie De Ne Pas Vivre, A Bellyful of Salt and Spleen), but the classic Napalm deathgrind style is still present, especially in the very energetic and straightforward title and opening tracks. Talking about catalogs, how impressive is Barney's vocal performance here! He especially surprised me in Joie De Ne Pas Vivre. Sometimes I couldn't believe it's him, but as far as I know he wasn't joined by Mitch this time. By the way, who recorded the guitars here? I know that because of private issues Mitch no longer plays live with Napalm, but was supposed to record on the albums and even though Shane wrote almost every song alone, he is credited for doing so. But it's not certain for me, as he isn't on any of the promo photos and in every interview with Barney that I have watched, he didn't tell anything about Mitch. Also, Mitch is at the moment promoting his new band with Dirk Verbeuren. But whoever is responsible for the guitars here, he delivered a strong performance.\n\nWorth noting is that despite being very eclectic, the record manages to remain consistent, but it may not be certain after first spins or at least that's how it was for me. It's actually very impressive that a mostly grindcore/death metal band put post punk and industrial into their music and it came out being very good. It only shows how good of a songwriter Shane Embury is. But I still miss Mitch's songwriting a bit. Fun fact is that (as far as I know) the only song that he co-wrote is A Bellyful of Salt and Spleen, a song... without guitar. But at least it's a very intriguing song. For me, it doesn't work as a single, but it's perfect as the song that ends the album. The lyrics are worth a praise too. Barney has always been a visionary that loves to play with the language and here he showed it again. Whether it's very straightforward and brutal or more deep lyrics, it works well here.\n\nBut I don't understand one decision that was made here. In the extended version, there are two songs between the title and the ending track and in the standard version there's only one. And what I kind of don't understand is the fact that the bonus song is way better than the one that made it to the standard version, which is the weakest part of the record. Feral Carve-up in turn impresses with its punk structure with some hidden melodies. In general, despite many mixed styles, the \"grindcold\" is always here and I love it. All of it makes Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism transcend musical boundaries and despite not being perfect, being one of the most intriguing extreme metal albums this year so far. This in turn makes Napalm Death still stand out after all these years, but in a bit different way than before.\n\nI'm trying hard not to be one of these \"They did it again! Another masterpiece!\" guys and I'm actually not. Napalm's discography (like discographies of most of the other great bands) has its worse and better parts, but on the last two albums they are definitely at their best. Without any idealization that often happens to the fans of this band, I can confidently say Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism is a must-listen for any extreme music fan.\n\nOriginally written for Tony Blackthrasher on Instagram and Facebook and The Metal Observer.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death is one of those bands that needs no introduction since they are undoubtedly one of the greatest ambassadors of extreme music for the past three decades. Grindcore pioneers, the band not only built the foundations of the genre with seminal releases like Scum and From Enslavement to Obliteration, but were also crucial in its worldwide dissemination due to the high impact these two albums had on the underground circuit in the late eighties. Directly or indirectly, all contemporary grindcore-oriented bands have a piece of Napalm Death impregnated in their DNA. It is a stylistic inevitability.\n\nThe band's original grind signature, which derived from their hardcore/punk roots, gradually evolved into a more metal-oriented formula. The Mentally Murdered EP signals the transition point which will culminate in 1990's Harmony Corruption, clearly more death metal-ish, influenced by the Florida scene that was emerging by this time. This transitional period also marks the moment when I truly began to enjoy the band's sound, enthusiastically embracing their more metal-oriented approach.\n\nSocial and political issues have always been present in the band's lyrics and, as expected, Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism is no exception. The dove, symbol of hope, being violently crushed by a sterile hand is a metaphor for a dehumanized society and its discrimination against \"others\", be they migrants or whether they have a different type of sexuality, for example. However, despite such oppression, we can still see a symbol of equality in the center of the dove, meaning that even after such cruelty we can still glimpse something positive in the end, as expressed by the oxymoron in the album's title - \"the celebration of humanity even in the mangling jaws of negativity\". This celebration of diversity also migrates to songs like 'Joie de ne pas vivre' and 'Invigorating Clutch' that explore more experimental textures, or the post-punk 'Amoral' and Godflesh-esque 'A Bellyful of Salt and Spleen', that closes the album with an unusual tone. These songs bring some irreverence and unpredictability to the album, which rejects any kind of conformity. Nevertheless, despite these stylistic deviations, Napalm Death remains faithful to its grind roots, as proven by the overwhelming first four tracks that are among the best the band has recorded in recent years. It's impossible not to headbang to songs such as 'Backlash Just Because' or 'That Curse of Being in Thrall', the latter featuring a vibrant On The Brink Of Extinction-esque tempo. This approach is again present in 'Acting in Gouged Faith', which momentarily takes us into Harmony Corruption era. The album flows through contrasts and musical diversity, with unexpected freshness and experimentalism. The symbiosis between the lads is remarkable, revealing a tremendous artistic complicity that has taken decades to shape. Barney's vocals, although no longer showing the deep gutturals of his early days, remain quite unique, with the rest of the team playing their part with exemplary professionalism. Songs such as 'Zero Gravitas Chamber' or 'Fluxing of the Muscle' also deserve to be highlighted, with the former being one of my favorite tracks on the album.\n\nOver thirty years after Scum, Napalm Death keeps displaying an overwhelming irreverence, without losing either its ambition or its creativity. As the metaphor on its cover or the subliminal message in its title, Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism is an ode to diversity. It is a product of contrasts. And given the social and political conflicts emerging throughout the world, it seems wise to give it due attention.\n\nOriginally written for www.sputnikmusic.com\n",
        "\nOn the previous album, 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair', the band had smoothly transitioned into a nice blend of classic death-grind gone bigger and wider with their sound to slip into their mid-90's death metal mode. Where the earlier records were totally focused on grind-spirited brutality, that album had achieved a fuller sound with more tools to its arsenal. On this record here, 'Diatribes', Napalm continue their progression towards an even more wide open sound, in clear contrast with the smothering/oppressive tone of a 'Harmony Corruption' from earlier in the decade. This still is Napalm with their typical heaviness, and the death metal tremolo riffs over blast beats are still a recurring feature, but a good chunk of the music now is more alternative metal (and in feel partly industrial metal), with at times even upbeat moments (see opening riff), and a lot of the pure grindcore from the olden days has been replaced by a more mainstream hardcore element. So in sense the band have gone from sounding completely bleak and underground to sounding more over-the-surface and accessible.\n\nThis wouldn't be a problem in theory, from the standpoint it constitutes an evolution of their sound rather than stubborn artistic staleness, and the band showed a certain courage with taking the risk of moving outside their comfort zone with both their music and their standing with the fan base, but that fan base rightfully expects the band in this case to either maintain the same level of quality or even improve upon it. And the album comes across as relatively flat in places, and not as inspired as previous releases, regardless of style whether classic death-grind or mid 90's crossover metal or otherwise. A lot of the material is quite linear and even sounding and settles for a consistent average quality. The riffs no longer sound like they're commanding, or like they draw in the listener with their sheer intensity like before. They do however retain the dark dissonance that was introduced and exploited well on the previous record, that's such a cornerstone for so much guitar work in any metal from the mid 90's whether underground or more mainstream. The album does possess some of that atmospheric depth that gives it more of a three-dimensional aspect.\n\nSo it's not all on the shallow level, and one example of that atmospheric depth would be the highlight 'Cold Forgiveness', probably the darkest track on this and arguably the best. The opener 'Greed Killing' is also an interesting take on the Napalm sound and offers an intriguing first step for the listener into the album. In fact in retrospect the first 5 songs are a well satisfying rendition of new Napalm; and an EP of just those five would've garnered a high rating; but the rest of the album sounds like a staler chunk of more of the same material without any new dynamics as is expected at this stage of the record. Had the band been able to inject more momentum into this after Track 5, with a couple of highlights with newer elements for example, the album would've suffered a lot less. \n\nOverall this is decent in quality and makes for a fun listen, but a lot of the tracks will have that non-essential feel about them. It's just disappointing that, in that new mold and sound they elected to build this record into, they couldn't make the songs stand out more and maintain a high standard throughout the whole album. It's a powerful sound, but a lot of its potential is left untapped. 'Ripe for the Breaking' is a great example of the band squeezing out the essence of this new found sound and showing off its range with aplomb, but few tracks are as memorable or optimal using the album's musical concept.\n\nThe next album, 'Inside The Torn Apart', very similar to this one, would be a step even further in that direction of groove-driven dissonant alt-metal, with (dare I say) nu-metal influences.\n",
        "\nIt seems that wherein any brand of extreme metal is concerned; all roads seem to lead towards the hardcore scene of the early 80s. Few understand this better than one of the earliest proponents of the grindcore subgenre, namely Birmingham\u2019s own Napalm Death. Though they originally cut their teeth as a member of the hardcore scene going all the way back to their 1982 demo Halloween, hailing from the same city that gave the world Black Sabbath and Judas Priest all but predestined them to move towards a more metallic sound, which arguably came to full fruition when guitarists Mitch Harris and Jesse Pintado joined the fold in 1989. The following year would see one of the most consequential albums under the death metal umbrella in this outfit\u2019s 3rd studio LP Harmony Corruption, joining Bolt Thrower, Carcass and a few others in putting the U.K. on the map as one of the rival scenes to the then exploding Florida one.\n\nDespite Pintado, who was a major part of shaping Napalm Death\u2019s earlier primitive hardcore sound into their current death/grind hybrid style, departed the band in 2004 and later this earth in 2006, the basic sound template of their aforementioned 1990 breakthrough has continued to shape their output. It can be best described as a more simplified, yet also less orthodox approach to conjuring up the extreme fringes of the metal style, placing a heavy degree on raw noise and aggression that is, nevertheless, organized into a set of coherent songs that are generally of a moderately short length. Now without a single member of their fold under the age of 50, they\u2019ve returned after a five year break since their 2015 LP Apex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat (barring a couple of shorter releases) to showcase that they can still grind with the same fervor as they did 30 years ago on their 16th full length offering Throes Of Joy In The Jaws Of Defeatism.\n\nThe more than a mouthful of an album name notwithstanding, this is the sort of no nonsense, going straight for the jugular mode of aggression at break-neck speed that any follower of the grind scene has come to expect. Such pummeling anthems of discontent as \u201cBacklash Just Because\u201d and the title song blur the lines between being pure eardrum-piercing noise and having something resembling a melodic catharsis, though translated through a lens of distorted and dissonant rage. Between the jostling transitions between high octane death thrash mayhem and chaotic blast beats, there is a dense and cold character to the noise elements that occasionally sound industrial in nature, in fact, the second half of opening crusher \u201cFuck The Factoid\u201d almost totally crosses into a sort of blackened industrial aesthetic, all but flipping the script on what would otherwise be more of a barebones hybrid of metallic brutality and grinding noise.\n\nNaturally a band with such deep roots in the original hardcore scene is not going to spend all of its time attempting to break the speed of sound, and there are plenty of fist-pumping moments to go with the frenzied ones. The first half of \u201cActing In Gouged Faith\u201d alongside the lion\u2019s share of \u201cFluxing Of The Muscle\u201d has a bit more of a thrashing character to the riff work, and while still winding up in blast territory and painted over with a loud and glassy bass sound, are a bit more restrained. On the subject of massive bass presence, the sub-3 minute exercise in pure auditory ugliness that is \u201cJoie De Ne Pas Vivre\u201d has it in spades, relegating the guitar to more of an atmospheric accompaniment and featuring vocalist Mark Greenway delivering up a truly vile snarl that barely registers as human. Nevertheless, the brightest spot in this collection is the more hardcore infused speeder \u201cZero Gravitas Chamber\u201d, which is the most memorable and accessible of the bunch and could almost be a Discharge homage if it were a bit less brutal and saturated in distortion.\n\nWhile the odds of Napalm Death ever topping the utter brilliance that was on display during their early 90s material, this album is yet another in a fairly consistent succession of good albums that they\u2019ve put out following the exit of Jesse Pintado. Remaining true to their punk roots, this is a collection of skull-shattering anthems that leaves its mark largely by aggression alone, eschewing most of the technical trappings of their adopted death metal aesthetic, save the insane drum work of Danny Herrera, who is somehow able to blast away in his 50s with the same degree of intensity he did back in the days of Utopia Banished and Fear, Emptiness, Despair. Nearly 40 years to the day that they first set out to promote peace through auditory violence and socially aware lyrics, they\u2019re still flying the flags of angst and discontent, and while their brand proves an acquired taste, it\u2019s also one that really sticks to one\u2019s ribs.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nPure, unadulterated resentful death-grind. That description alone would suffice.\n\nEach track consists of scornful death metal tremolo picking over blast beats, excellent sinister single note riffing and uptempo grindish power chord sections. The riffs are driven and inspired, dark and nihilistic in tone, and display spot-on distribution between those different modes with how the grind alternates with the death metal. The vocals are unleashed and utterly irreverent. The bass is aggro overdriven sub presence to fill in the center of the tracks. The drums sound alive and authentic, with particularly punchy snares and kicks that sound fairly modern for 1990. In fact all of the kicks, snares and toms were given that tight compressed tone (that producers would later exaggerate in modern metal) and the album generally feels rhythmically tight and clean, allowing the guitars and vocals to come through with more clarity.\n\nThe production/sensation throughout the album is one of smothering. The sound is purposely muffled and oppressive. The guitars have that pure early 90's death metal ominous tone to them, and where they lack the definition of later death metal they make up for with a tone that I could only describe as underground like. The power chords sound meaty and voracious. The blast beats are furious. It's a delight of early extreme metal. \n\nInterestingly, this album feels more organized than some of the later albums. One might think since Napalm are a band that started as full-on grindcore and later turned to death metal more, that the closer to their early works the more chaotic. And yet this one definitely feels more structured and tightly put together than, say, the very loose 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair' from 4 years later. \n\nThe album possesses a bit of an aura to it, starting with the album cover and main title. 'Harmony Corruption' is one of these titles that seem to work on multiple levels of meaning. It feels like it carries an important message, that's both current and timeless simultaneously. The album cover is also obscure, and cryptic with what its exact message is, but it's highly evocative and strangely fits the music despite being cartoonish in style. It's like the relation between its implicit violence and the brutal nature of the music makes sense.\n\nOne aspect about this record is also its modernity for its time and its historical significance in the field and beyond. Not many bands were sounding like full on death metal back in 1990 and the very musical concept was in its infancy. Lots of bands already had death metal elements in their music, but few sounded like full-fledged death metal with all of blast beats, growls, the whole guitar arsenal with tremolo picking, massive power chords, and that deep/dark subversive feel in the riffs in general. Most bands that dabbled in the genre still sounded somewhat thrashy. And for a band to release a record this heavy at the very start of the 90's, when groove metal only became a thing much later, is a notable feat in itself.\n\nThe songs do a great job at executing the riffs and making sure they're straight to the point and don't linger, as the tracks rarely make it over 4min. There's nothing but relevant, efficient riffing on display from start to finish, and given the brutal/unrelenting nature of the music they did really well at not blatantly repeating themselves or sounding like the whole thing is just one variation of the one same song. For the listener that enjoyed the opener, it's a quality ride all the way through, while of course it might get a tad tiring after about half an hour and 10 tracks in, simply because the music is taxing and nonstop action.\n",
        "\nSubtlety isn't this band or album's strong point, nor is it necessary when the point is to be utterly destructive the way this album here is.\n\nRight off the bat, an uncompromising and primal scream, like an ogre smashing through a door, welcomes the listener into the bleak and powerful world of 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair'. The album makes no effort to be appealing whatsoever and just spews its filthy brand of death-grind all over the place. Every track is as nasty and loose as the next and doesn't care for any remote notion of convention whether it's proper song intros, tidiness in song-writing, making the vocals sound tight or technical showboating to impress the listener. And it works so damn well that way. The album has immeasurable amounts of charm with how dirty and relentless it is, and the songs still don't come across as grindcore soup. \n\nThe tracks give themselves the freedom to be brutal with highly energetic power chord grooves, then throw in a darkly melodic or abrasive low-tuned open string riff, go death metal tremolo picking over blast beats unexpectedly, and then go full-on atmospheric (as on the dark and sorrowful 'More Than Meets the Eye', notably). The giant sounding grooves are just contagious and terribly headbang-inducing, and they're distributed just right among the other sections for more effect when they come on. They're so perfectly balanced with their progression between one part and the next, and how the changing grooves on the drums conduct the whole. They might sound simplistic on the surface but they're actually all over the fret-board, jack-knife quick power chord successions that just never quit, and this must be really challenging stuff to handle for a full live show. Relentless stuff, just really no other way to put than they're heavy as fuck. Some of the guitar work might come as a surprise with how experimental and outside-the-box it is, as the first riff on 'Primed Time' shows with its coarse low/high octave playing. \n\nBy all means this could've sounded utterly redundant, with so much of the music being about heavy grooves on every single track, and yet it instills a form of constant excitement into the listener provided they have a taste for this sort of savagery. The energy is so contagious from beginning to end. It's like an unrelenting bulldozer crushing everything in its path and it'll beat the crap out of you but in a way that's somehow relevant after each stop before the next aural assault. Try giving even the last song, 'Living in Denial', an ear. It's no filler song by any stretch.\n\nMoreover, it's got that mid 90's sound where the production isn't as crisp as on later releases but the songs just come alive without being overproduced. It's organic and loose and its intensity feels untrammeled and untamed. It's got this natural girth and momentum about it, almost like a full-band live recording in the studio.\n\nThe dark atmospheric touch and the subversive melodic element, almost industrial and reminiscent of Godflesh in feel, adds that extra dynamic and depth that makes it viable even for the non death/grind fanatic. It settles the listener into a sort of trance with its brutal power chord repetitions and forceful drums, like easing into this manic rhythmic pounding and falling prey to its engulfing energy. Its sheer passion and ability to renew its momentum track after track sets it apart from lots of similar releases which dwell in more shallow areas of the death-grind universe. This is powerful, bleak atmospheric death-grind with real purpose and personality of rare quality, which probably won't be replicated again given the direction the scene has taken today.\n",
        "\nI never really cared that much at all for this album aside from standout tracks such as Multinational Corporations, Instinct of Survival, and Scum. I definitely prefer From Enslavement to Obliteration, and all the albums following it over this one. Scum isn't bad, in my opinion it's just flawed in some areas and not as colorful as the band's other albums.\n\nThis album is supposedly the \"true pioneering force of grindcore\", and I think that it's a pretty solid start for the genre. But my ONLY issue is that it's half good, half \"what the hell happened???.....\"\n\nBasically, Side A, the first album of this album; is great. It's full of energy, the guitars have a great sound that maintains a nice balance of relentless grinding and the ability to hear actual notes and melodies being played, and the drums have a cool, poppy, fulfilling sound. It isnt too solid nor too soft, it's just right. On the other hand with Side B, the second half; it's all fucked up. It's drastically different from the first half of the album. The guitars have lost their great sound, it instead sounds like some damn random gray wankery for the hell of \"grindcore\". It's sloppy as well, but pretty much the issue is that the guitars sound entirely different compared to the first half, I just dont understand why this happened. It sounds like some \"brootal\" demo or something. \n\nSure, the second half is quite some grindcore, but it's a drastic difference in comparison to the first half. You're just chilling and enjoying the music, and as soon as \"Life?\" comes on, you immediately notice the change, and it confuses you, leaves you thinking something along the lines of \"uhhhh...what just happened? It's not that great anymore.\" The second half is definitely listenable, but compared to the first half it aint shit. So much greatness has dissapeared.\n\nPretty much what I'm trying to say is:\nSide A: Awesome iconic grindcore that's fun, awesome, catchy, and has personality.\nSide B: Sloppy, messy, demo ass material, wank-ish, gray noise grindcore for the hell of it.\n\nThis issue could've easily been prevented, I dont know why an entire half of the album has to sound different and not as good compared to the other, but oh well. If it all sounded like Side A I would have absolutely ZERO issues with Scum at all. This is definitely a great and iconic album, but one entire other half is different from the first half. I personally reccomend From Enslavement to Obliteration, it's much better and it doesn't change up it's sound. Scum is good, but it's half bland crap that appears out of nowhere, unfortunately. I'd give this a very high rating if such a drastic amount of the album wasn't the bad part, I dont want to give this such a low score that is 65%, but I have to since it consists largely of the not good side.\n\n+65 for Side A\n-35 for Side B\n",
        "\nSo it's been five years since Napalm Death put out their critically acclaimed album Apex Predator - Easy Meat. So naturally, it's the perfect time to review said album. Apex Predator - Easy Meat continues the upward trend that Napalm Death went on since 2006's Smear Campaign. The ironic thing here is that Apex Predator - Easy Meat is probably the angriest record that these Birmingham legends ever put out. And this was before America's greatest president in a while, Donald Trump got elected.\n\nSo yes, the lyrics on Apex Predator - Easy Meat are political subject matter taken to the extreme. However most of the time you cannot understand them because you're being simultaneously bombarded with blast beats and crushing riffs. Take \"Stubborn Stains\" for example, a casual listener would be turned off and think it's noise, but an experienced listener would understand the complexity and the subject matter. One favorite of mine is \"Hierarchies\", which contains some wicked guitar riffs and a breathtaking clean-sung chorus. It's also one of the few songs on Apex Predator - Easy Meat to contain a guitar solo. \"Dear Slum Landlord...\" is also a unique song in which the guitars take some influence from the sludge metal genre.\n\nMitch Harris' guitars are prominent on Apex Predator - Easy Meat, however, all four musicians share the spotlight. Whereas Utilitarian was basically deathgrind that leaned towards death metal, this album leans more towards the grind spectrum. The majority of the songs are below three minutes making the music on Apex Predator - Easy Meat very tight, leaving zero error. Special mention goes to \"Smash a Single Digit\" which clocks in at 1:25, the shortest song on the album which also received a music video. Harris' guitars are generally rhythm based, but are lead based in certain songs like the aforementioned \"Hierarchies\". Barney Greenway sounds the angriest he's ever been considering he was 44-45 during recording especially on \"Bloodless Coup\". Danny Herrera's drumming is everywhere on Apex Predator - Easy Meat and is arguably the most relentless of his career. Shane Embury's bass may not be as audible as the other three players but this is grindcore, a subgenre where a lot of bands don't even have a bassist. Regardless, Embury and Harris will provide lead vocals on certain songs.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Apex Predator - Easy Meat is considered to be one of Napalm's finest achievements, but ultimately that's a true statement. The album has no weak spots whatsoever and relies on pressuring the listener with controlled chaos. Whereas bands like Pig Destroyer eventually turned to shit, Napalm Death continued their consistency as their musicianship continues to evolve and please metalheads. Apex Predator - Easy Meat is so good in fact that I picked it as one of my favorite grind albums in a Shreddit Discord poll. So if you're waiting for Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism just like me, take some time during this pandemic and listen to this fantastic record.\n",
        "\nHistorical context; \nNapalm Death have existed longer with Barney and Mitch than all their pre-1990 members combined. I could sulk how the days of From Enslavement and Mentally Murdered will never return since those are still my fave releases in the history of Napalm Death. Or I could just not do that (anymore). Admittedly I did so, a lot, in the era 1994-1998, when Napalm Death had hit rock bottom musically and tried to appeal to the groovy needs of those days. But since the release of \u2018Enemy of the Music Business\u2019 back in 2000 the band rediscovered themselves. And so did I.\n\nBack in 1992 a young new group named Fear Factory took the old grindin\u2019 Napalm Death and combined this with influences from Godflesh (a band from an ex-Napalm Death member) and other industrial pioneers like Ministry , to create something not entirely new, but a new refreshing mixture which drew lots of new fans, mostly because of their tight performance. Now Fear Factory\u2019s days of glory have already past after pretty much only 2 real classic albums, but Napalm Death took back the music and have been releasing consistent quality since 2000 again. \n\nCurrent day;\nIn 2015, \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\", just like the previous 6 full length studio albums, not only brings back industrial grind elements to the UK but Napalm Death remains grindcore in essence, mixing it with crustpunk as well and of course their knack for throwing in old school Voivod riffs and Celtic Frost riffs into the mix. The only thing different on each of the last 6 albums is the balance of styles and influences between them. \n\nIf I have to compare \u2018Apex Predator\u2019 to an earlier album it would easily be putting Apex somewhere between \u2018The Code Is Red\u2019 and \u2018Smear Campaign\u2019 stylewise. And this of course is memorable seeing how those are very fine Napalm Death albums. \n\nFor those that also took the effort to check out their least interesting era (as said the 1994-1998), a lot of the less grindcore orientated songs and experiments on Apex Predator are refinements of earlier ideas from that period, often as if combining their Utopia Banished album with a dose of experimentalism as shown on Diatribes album. A good example would be trying to mix \u2018Ripe For The Breaking\u2019 and \u2018Cursed To Crawl\u2019 from the Diatribes album with Utopia Banised\u2019s \u2018The World Keeps Turning\u2019 and \u2018Dementia Access\u2019.\n\nWhat Apex Predaor does so well, is mixing the industrial parts and Voivod/Frost orientated riffs much more naturally this time. It\u2019s as if the songs just wrote themselves. They sound diverse yet not overly contrived. The best examples being the albums highlight \u2018Hierarchies\u2019 or the entirely slow paced and very creepy \u2018Dear Slum Landlord\u2019. \n\nAlso the highly threatening industrial opening title track is perhaps their beste since \u2018Evolved as One\u2019. What an atmosphere! Again present throughout the album are the staple vocals: grunts, screams, incidental punk orientated clean vocals and layered \u2018Gregorian chants\u2019 the band had been known for the last decades with Barney and Mitch sharing vocals. And wondering what I mean about the Celtic Frost orientated riffs? Try closer \u2018Adversarial / Copulating Snakes\u2019. I need not say more, do I? \n\nApex Predator is another excellent Napalm Death album and far from surprising if you are actually familiar with their backcatalogue and not just looking at the band with your horse blinkers still on (craving either Scum or Harmony Corruption part two). \n\nWhat is also so great about it, is that there are some real new classic individual songs to be found. \u2018Smash a Single Digit\u2019, \u2018How the Years Condemn\u2019 and especially \u2018Hierarchies\u2019 could easily become staple songs if the fans want more than the eighties classics.\n",
        "\nI don't need to introduce Napalm Death: grindcore founders (GTFO Repulsion), extreme music stalwarts, praise be to them, etc.\n\nElectro Hippies were a band once. Jeff Walker fronted them for a minute, then joined Carcass and music was better for it. They have one kinda decent album, only notable for contributing a little to early grindcore. Not really special beyond that.\n\nYeah. So, this isn't a split. This is something you show a friend, then they give you a weird look, and you wonder why you invite people over anymore. Two songs, one per side, each running for a second each. 'You Suffer' is... I don't know, it is what it is. Not any better (see 'funnier') here than on Scum. And EH's 'Mega Armageddon Death Pt. 3' is a lesser version of it. Not even the one chord that is the entire song sounds nice enough for me to care. This is what grimy basement-dwelling metalheads bring up as a footnote to a footnote in conversation to make their friends laugh, but they only chuckle awkwardly, and then everyone goes quiet and you just hate yourself well into the next morning. Yeah. Now go home.\n",
        "\nIt's sad to say that the grindcore days are over. But at least Napalm Death is still making music, even though it's totally different than what they began as. 'Time Waits For No Slave' is a good illustration where they're coming 2 genres, death metal and some grind. It's odd because I was so used to the Mick Harris blast beats from the 6 years that he was with the band. But Danny is an OK replacement. This album is heavy, but the tempo changes are evident and totally there, but the blasting is limited. The production quality is a little raw, but OK. I liked the whole album. I thought that at least for death metal fans, this is a good one.\n\nThe guitars aren't riffing too fast. That intensity is gone, but at least the music sounds good. It's a shame that they lost Jesse. I think he was a big influence on the band being that he was with Terrorizer in the early days. I guess when Mick left the band, that was the end of the real extreme days. I felt that he was the best grindcore drum in existence. Danny is good especially on here. It seems as though he's matured behind the set and is more comfortable with being alongside this band. It's amazing that they've been around since 1981. I was 5 when they formed! Anyway, it's difficult to pinpoint specific highlights on here, just that some tracks are fast then they completely chill out.\n\nI like the variety on this release, it can get really intense. Their newer stuff is LOUD. Meaning thier latest release. This album is one of their longer releases, it clocks in at about 50+ minutes. It's worth listening to, but it just takes some getting used to. If you're expecting Napalm Death of the old, it's sad but they're not really doing it. This release I'd say in the death metal genre is solid. I actually decided to order the CD. I know that this album is outdated and they're working on new material. I just thought that I'd write about it anyway. Even if it is an older Napalm Death release.\n\nSaying farewell to Jesse and the departed members of the earlier Napalm. It's a good lineup still and there literally are no leads on this album. It's just all rhythms which is why I like the album. Jesse was more solid in the lead department but Mitch has constructed some pretty good riffs. They're diverse and that's what makes the album interesting to listen to. I know earlier it sounded as though I wanted old ND back but that just isn't going to happen. What they evolved to is something totally different. A lot of their albums post-Mick are strickly death metal except 'Utopia Banished'. But that one wasn't very good in my opinion.\n",
        "\nEver since 'Scum' and 'The Peel Sessions' came out, I was hooked on this band. Even though they play more death metal (especially on this one) it hasn't shyed me away from liking this band. So on 'The Code Is Red...Long Live The Code', you'll hear a more ND death metal approach to their music. Though there is blast beating by Danny on here, it's mostly just fast riffing that's mixed. This is more of a death metal approach to music on here, as opposed to the old line-up producing sheer and utter noise-grindcore. I kind of miss that about the band and thought that 'Harmony Corruption' (and still do) was their greatest times.\n\nI admire the fact that the music on here varies, but miss the intensity of the old ND. At least they're still making music though they're veterans now. Barney's vocals changed after 'Death By Manipulation'. It's not as low and he doesn't do the loud massive roars like Barney of the old. But now they have Mitch contributing screams periodically. Screams ups the variety and keeps you guessing. A still highly politcally based band lyrically but the focus is on the music, not so much the lyrics. A lot of songs on here too, that's why they split it up. The guitar is pretty unique though the riff quality is nowhere near as good as on 'Harmony Corruption'.\n\nIt's fresh meat though, even though this was released in 2005. It's pretty new to me because it's the first time hearing this album. I don't necessarily like the slower stuff near the ending of the album, but for the bulk of it, it's a \"B\". I felt that they measured up to their standards. And the fact that this is death metal and not grindcore anymore, they still are pretty much the founders of that genre. I think it'd possibly be Mitch making the turn into death metal and it's a big loss that ND doesn't have Jesse anymore. Died too young, that's for sure. I think Napalm Death wanted a change because the only real original member is Shane. Even he came later however.\n\nI liked this album enough to write about it. I thought that the musical quality was good, just that they should've taken out the outros. They should've just ended at track 13 and that's it. But they squeezed in two unnecessary tracks. I guess that that's how they wanted it to be though. A big transformation from them then I used to know. Especially listening to 'The Peel Sessions' in High School. It seems as though now that there's less fire in the band because of the lack of Mick, Lee and Bill, they should've changed their name. They aren't losing their fire entirely, but let's see how they sound if they're releasing a new album in 2020.\n",
        "\nThis ep to me represents the Apex of Napalm Death because it's not only extremely frantic and off the wall, but the songwriting is great and there are hints of a very grimy death metal edge starting to take form here (no surprise considering Bill Steer's involvement in Carcass' Symphonies of Sickness which was released around the same time and has a very similar sound).\n\nPerhaps it is the production itself that elevates this above it's brothers, considering the title track was initially included on the From Enslavement to Obliteration album, where it's good there, but one of the plusses to this production is that the guitar is more audible as opposed to muddy on the FETO version.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these are ND's most developed songs at this particular point, and they are all extremely well written, while simultaneously having that morbid, dirty edge that makes death metal, y'know DEATH metal. Consider a song such as No Mental Effort, with that fucking amazing riff about mid way through the track (between around 1:50 to 2:30 in the song). It's twisted, it's beautiful, and it makes this such a relic of the early days of this amazing music. Other songs with great riffs include: The opening of Rise Above, the riff right after the first verse in Mentally Murdered, as well as basically every other riff on this album. Lee Dorian's growls on this EP are enjoyable, but not the greatest. They are reverbed and echoey, but don't add much to the music, in fact, they don't need to. Mick Harris is of course in top form here, delivering an exciting performance just like with every other Napalm Death album he appeared on.\n\nIf you like Symphonies of Sickness, you need to check this baby out. It sounds fucking great, and is just really exciting music, the way that all good death metal/grindcore music should be.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death\u2019s development was like many bands, a steady shuffling of puzzle pieces. The players from their exceptional debut were splintered in a thousand directions rather quickly. In fact, three years later only drummer Mick Harris remained. The lineup would continue to shift, but this snapshot of players proved to be special. \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d is a strong, no-frills death metal record that retains their powerful blast beat-crazed style along with corrosive crust-punk guitar riffing, all served up in a collection of longer songs that stand the test of time. \n\nBarney Greenway\u2019s gurgling vocals were not for the faint of heart, particularly in 1990. But listening back to the album now, it\u2019s hard to imagine cuts like \u201cMalicious Intent\u201d with anyone else, crunching hard-panned riffs woven between Harris\u2019 blasting madness sound fantastic with Greenway\u2019s trademark rumbles. Embury\u2019s bass tone is a foul, deafening roar that may not lead the charge outright, but it\u2019s emergence about a minute into \u201cInner Incineration\u201d just kicks all kinds of ass. \u201cSuffer the Children\u201d also tears out of the blocks with head-bruising thrash action, before eventually settling on a near-perfect bone-grinding doomy riff. Closer, \u201cHiding Behind\u201d is the strongest on the entire album, particularly thrashy, Greenway barking and spitting out metallic filth in nightmarish fashion. \n\nIt\u2019s not all top-shelf. \u201cThe Chains That Bind Us\u201d cycles through some of the best riffs on the album (particularly after the solo), but the band doesn\u2019t give them time to breathe. This \u201churried\u201d effect does drag down some of the otherwise excellent songs. Fortunately, a few \u201cbusy\u201d tracks don\u2019t undercut the quality of the album. \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d, a true gem from the early days of death-meets-grind.\n",
        "\nA frenzy of battering percussion and wicked guitar riffs potent enough to suck the air out of a room, Scum took the metal world by storm for multiple reasons. It\u2019s a sort of solar eclipse, capturing a time when Lee Dorian, Justin Broderick, Bill Steer, and Mick Harris were just four gutter punks looking to offend the masses, speeding over legends like Discharge and Extreme Noise Terror.\n\nIt\u2019s also an important reference point for future grindcore releases, which over the years would become more and more complex in nature. Grindcore should sound like punk, a group of street bums abusing the hell out of guitar, bass and drums, barely holding it together. Today, grind is a drum clinic or space opera. Scum lays down the gauntlet: short, fast, guttural, and abrasive.\n\nThe numerous short songs are a more challenging listen than traditional death metal records. Much has been written about this album (essentially the first grindcore record, see Choosing Death for all the details), but few have touched on how impressive it is sonically. Steer\u2019s guitar tone is so nasty and distorted, like the sound of a nuclear power plant melting down or some ugly machine belching along as workers frantically feed it with coal. The squealing, ear-shredding harmonics in \u201cSiege of Power\u201d, the burbling groove in \u201cM.A.D\u201d, and the filthy riff chain of \u201cC.S\u201d set against those pummeling drums. While it may not be everyone\u2019s go-to death metal record, it\u2019s still required reading for extreme metal fans the world over.\n",
        "\nAs it turns out, Napalm Death can release 90 minutes of disparate bonus tracks, singles, and tracks from various splits and compilations, complete with production differences and ranging over a recording period of 2004 to 2014, and just about all of them are at least good, if not fantastic additions to your Napalm Death catalog.\n\n18 of these tracks are from studio sessions for the albums \"The Code Is Red... Long Live the Code\" and forward through \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\", and originally appear as bonus tracks on various versions of those respective albums. It's safe to say that just about all of these tracks kick significant amounts of ass and are nearly all of the quality of the respective proper album tracks. The breakdown is as follows: \"The Code is Red...\" represented by two tracks, \"Smear Campaign\" and \"Time Waits for No Slave\" each represented by three tracks, \"Utilitarian\" represented by four tracks, and \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\" represented by a whopping six tracks. Only some of the \"Apex Predator\" songs can be considered as lacking compared with the rest, with \"Critical Gluttonous Mass\" and more so \"Caste as Waste\" being the offenders (the latter in particular is one of those modern \"atmospheric\" ND tracks that attempts to set a mood, and in this particular case is mostly a dud). Otherwise, everything is really good, from a short hardcore cover like \"Crash the Pose\", to a slow ND song that has seriously grown on me with every listen in \"Atheist Runt\", to monster slabs of ND's modern deathmetalgrindcore in tunes like \"Losers\", \"Call That an Option?\", \"Suppressed Hunger\", \"Everything in Mono\", and \"Oh So Pseudo\".\n\nThe other 13 tracks are mostly pulled from split EPs and compilation appearances, and while they generally don't wow quite as much as the studio album bonus tracks, you're still fully aware that this is Napalm Death, and their songwriting quality generally holds in these as well. There is one more \"atmospheric dud\" that must be acknowledged in \"Oxygen of Duplicity\", but that is balanced with fast grindfests like \"Legacy Was Yesterday\", \"Youth Offender\", and \"An Extract (Strip It Clean)\". \"To Go Off and Things\" (a Cardiacs cover) must be mentioned in particular: I never imagined that Napalm Death would play a song filled with goofy keys, or that it could be good, but this is a perfect example of Napalm Death taking a song completely outside of their sphere/sound and molding it to make it their own (look up the original song first, I'd never heard of it or the Cardiacs at all before).\n\nIf I could change one thing, I would have released this compilation in chronological order of release, so the listener can hear the subtle evolution of Napalm Death over the decade of 2004 - 2014 (like it or not, we have to admit that Barney has had to rely somewhat more on vocal effects in recent years, which are lacking at least in the two \"The Code Is Red...\" offerings, and suddenly present in various degrees from \"Smear Campaign\" onward).\n\nTo conclude, if you're a fan of even just a couple of Napalm Death studio albums from 2005 and onward, this compilation is worth your money to get the bonus tracks that you may not currently own. I quite enjoy listening to the bonus tracks, and the \"other songs\" are still pretty good as well.\n",
        "\nAbout a decade ago, as I was first getting into metal, I found out about something called grindcore and, just like every other genre, I tried it out. Unlike most of the other genres though, I quickly decided it wasn\u2019t for me and never revisited it, though through the years, I\u2019d occasionally wonder if I was missing something by ignoring it.\n\nWell, enough time has passed and I\u2019m ready to give the genre a fair shake. I\u2019ve decided to dedicate a few reviews to grindcore releases to help me along. And what better place is there to start than one of genre pioneer Napalm Death\u2019s earliest and most acclaimed works? \n\nNumerous other places, most likely. From Enslavement to Obliteration is an amateurish album so obsessed with delivering the most viciously heavy listening experience possible that it neglects to give listeners anything especially compelling. If you want a sandblasting for your ears, this release has you covered but if you want songwriting that's in any way thoughtful, layered, or memorable, there aren\u2019t a lot of songs here you\u2019ll be satisfied with.\n\nThe main problem is the unreasonable number of microsongs. Why did Napalm Death ever think having so many of these was a good idea? Six of the songs on this release are less than a minute in length. Shit, one of them is 22 seconds. Why doesn\u2019t Napalm Death know that isn\u2019t enough time for a song that isn\u2019t a joke or some kind of atmospheric interlude to develop? Songs like \u2018Private Death\u2019, \u2018Impressions\u2019, and \u2018Uncertainty Blurs the Vision\u2019 don\u2019t go anywhere because they aren\u2019t given enough room to expand. Each of those three is little more than all the instrumentalists playing as fast as they can while vocalist Lee Dorrian yells or grunts incoherently for about as long as it takes you to tie your shoelaces. Because of this, there\u2019s no atmosphere or nuance for about half the album\u2019s length. Hell, the band doesn't even sound like it\u2019s trying to make the microsongs stand out from each other, a weird artistic choice that robs the album of memorability, diversity, and intrigue.\n\nLuckily, when Napalm Death actually gives itself enough room to allow songs to grow, that\u2019s typically what they do. The tracks here that exceed 1:15 or so in length don\u2019t have a ton of space but NP manages to cram in enough variation and development for them to feel like real songs rather than snippets thereof. Though this group doesn't have much interest in writing catchy riffs, some of these songs have commendable parts. \u2018Display to Me\u2019 starts with an invigorating gallop and has some enjoyable grooving in its second half. 'Mentally Murdered' switches up the tempo quite a few times and includes an odd drum pattern that makes the song so much more energizing than nonstop blasting ever could. Unfortunately, there aren't enough standouts. Every song on this release, except the intro, features a heaping helping of fast, brutal grinding and there aren\u2019t enough songs that bring more to the table. \n\nOverall, FEtO offers a glimpse at a band more interested in pushing the envelope in terms of musical extremity than in writing compelling, well-structured songs. However, there\u2019s some undeniable promise on this disc. A few of these songs reveal a band plenty capable of writing strong progressions and meaty riffs but the album as a whole indicates an unwillingness to make good use of this ability. On FEtO, NP's attempts at cultivating music from of a slurry of the harshest sounds possible is only mildly and sporadically effective.\n",
        "\nImagine this: you're 16 years old and a budding fan of heavy metal in all its strange forms. You walk into a charity shop, namely Oxfam, for a routine trawl through lots of old junk in the hope of finding something musically exciting. Apart from finding the debut album from The Darkness about sixty times in a weekend, that trip to Oxfam provided 16 year old me with a titillating rarity - an old Napalm Death album on cassette tape. You read that absolutely right and, now that I'm back home for a few weeks, I'm taking the opportunity to listen to that old cassette on my ancient tape Walkman, from which I dug some rotting AA batteries a few minutes ago.\n\nHonestly, I hated this album when I first heard it and am still having some trouble dealing with all the static that comes showering off the drums when Mick Harris takes them out for a blast. Let's put that down to my equipment though and I'll tell you why I've changed my mind (not totally, I'm warning you) about From Enslavement to Obliteration. First of all, there's the infallible argument that this is a huge milestone in extreme metal. It's not that Scum wasn't anything special the year before, but my word isn't this so much more of a finished product than that album was. Cutting 28 roughly minute long songs down to 22 was a help, as was that little bit of extra length exhibited on the opening shoutfest/crawlfest 'Evolved as One', plus 'Display to Me' and 'Unchallenged Hate', making a few of these cuts feel like entire songs instead of only violent outbursts of horribly chaotic noise. The opening sequence of riff transitions and subsequent breakdown into piledriving death thrash riffing during 'Think for a Minute' is a whole different kind of destruction to the punkier strains of the debut, a new approach which undoubtedly laid the way for much of the death metal template taken up by Entombed and their Swedish brethren, hardcore-influenced drumming and all.\n\nAside from the manner in which this album has shaped extreme metal in the years since 1988, the performances are a factor in proving that Napalm Death were ahead of the crowd in the grindcore field and From Enslavement to Obliteration remains an authoritative document on how to totally fuck shit up in half an hour, something that doesn't always come across on the debuts by Extreme Noise Terror and Carcass. That might seem odd given that Bill Steer was also responsible for guitars on Carcass's slightly earlier Reek of Putrefaction, though here he gives a simply immense-sounding tone a huge death metal twist by means of low chugging tones on 'Inconceivable?' which also fields several changes of pace and outstanding backing from Shane Embury's bass guitar, the whole mix of the strings and drums caving my head in now even with the limited technology available to me. A few spastic solos and occasional slower crushing chords mix in an underlying threat to an otherwise brutal display of shit-smashing frenzy that Mick Harris and particularly Lee Dorrian take to absurd levels of heaviness. I've already mentioned the painful static that I'm getting from Harris's drumming, which mostly stems from his ultra-fast cymbal strikes, though the barrage of footwork that he keeps up at other moments is simply astounding, especially when dropping in frequent shifts in speed to accommodate Steer's guitar ideas.\n\nLee Dorrian gets a paragraph to himself because, as a fan of his later band Cathedral, it's simply unimaginable how he could sound so utterly monstrous and wild on these songs. His deep growl rips through the chaos of crashing percussion in a way that makes me care little about debates of which death metal vocalist is the best, though his crazed higher shrieks were initially a huge turn-off for me. These shrieks seem to have little in the way of thought put into them and certainly do nothing for the atmosphere that his deeper growls do. The worst moment for them is on 'Practice What You Preach', when the vocal phrasing is akin to a school pupil yelling \"Ner-ner ner-ner-ner\" through the railings of the playground, though thankfully this doesn't happen too often and mostly suits the chaotic vibe.\n\nHowever, it must be said that because of Dorrian's unintelligible lyrics (not to say they are entirely unintelligent though), the songs are incredibly hard to tell apart, especially when they are of the shorter, more blast-obsessed variety, partly owing to Steer's use of some generic hyper-speed crust riffs. Also, if you paid attention at the beginning, I'm listening on cassette and so there aren't any track breaks, so I apologize if any of the song titles I have given as examples are not accurate. Then again, those longer numbers I mentioned work as excellent semi-death metal tirades of pure frustration and angry demolition, while the shorter numbers demonstrate a band who are as tight as a gnat's arse given the speed they are playing at. As a result of these things, I can't claim to thoroughly enjoy From Enslavement to Obliteration, though there are some great songs and a whole lot of influence nestled inside its short length. Oh, and by the way, it only cost me \u00a30.50. A win for Oxfam.\n",
        "\nIt sounds like a stone-cast rule. It sounds like almost a prerequisite for classic status. A goddamned requirement. The key that'll open the gates to headbanging heaven. The last step to an album's apotheosis to eternal acclaim and absolute be-all-end-all importance within this vast ocean we love called heavy metal. It's what separates the leaders from the followers. The grand statements of the masters all must abide by it, right? What the hell would we put on our lists of greatest metal albums? Who would we turn to when asked what albums got us into metal initially? How would we answer questions like 'where were you when you first heard it' or 'what's the song that blew your mind the most?' What would be argue for hours over if it didn't follow this one thing? How would we decide, in our hearts and in our minds, what the ultimate metal albums are? When the aliens, millions of years from now, when they're finally bringing together all the information regarding music of the post-1970 ages, how would they know which albums to look to when chronicling the grand and very rad history or metal? How would any of this be possible if a supposedly classic album isn't GOOD?\n\nOf course, there are the exceptions.\n\nWe must begin by addressing the most important factor as to why anyone still talks about Napalm Death's legendary 1987 debut record 'Scum' in any capacity. Yes, this really is one of the most influential and important albums in the history of metal. The Birmingham quartet of grind did what so few bands are able to right out of the gate: invent a new fucking genre. Yes, despite the bipolar, deeply flawed, inconsistent nature of this album hasn't dampened it's importance, it's influence, it's widespread appeal among metal and punk fans, or it's lasting appeal within the catacombs of underground music in general. It's really a fantastic feat. No one will deny that. And although this will be one of the few truly positive things I can say about this thing, I'll gladly hold this album in high regard for what it did for the further evolution and development of extreme metal and the genre it helped birth, grindcore. And I know, I know, Repulsion's debut record 'Horrified' did do a lot more for the genre, but we must face the fact that ND beat them to the punch by two years ('Horrified' was released in 1989). So yes, regardless of what comes next in the review, I stand by my belief, my goddamned conviction, that 'Scum' really is the original grindcore album and Napalm Death are the progenitors of the genre.\n\nAlright, time to tear this fucker apart. I don't like it, and here's why.\n\nLet me take you back to England's musical underground in the late 80's. Tape trading was in its prime, punk and metal fanzines sang praises of the fastest bands around, and you've been jamming a mixtape of bands from 'round the country. The best band is Napalm Death, hands down. They play the fastest, they're on the right side a.k.a. your side on all the big sociopolitical issues, and you just read in a fanzine that they've been signed to Earache Records, an upstart label that plans to release ND's debut album. Awesome shit, right? This was the peak of early extreme music, everything was about to blow the fucking scene out of the goddamn water. And it did. You've never heard anything like it. All of a sudden, Napalm Death are untouchable. 'Scum' has motherfucking arrived.\n\nBut then, years later, you go back and listen to it. And it's not as good as it once sounded. It doesn't rip like it used to. Makes sense, nothing stays gold forever. But what happens when you listen to something for the first time and it takes less than a year before it wears on you. No, seriously. That was me,\n\n'Scum' is an odd record due to the drastically different approaches to the grind punk/metal style it personifies. It's an album that can't make it up its mind about how it wants to create this genre, but that's not the band's direct fault. One of the more unusual and well-known factoids surrounding this release is the fact that two different lineups play on it. On the A side, it's Nik Bullen on bass and vocals, Justin Broadrick on guitar, and Mick Harris on drums. It's far punk-ier than the B side, showing off Napalm Death's hardcore roots most prominently. If I had to choose a side that sounds the more consistently tolerable, this would be it. It feels tighter and better written, with the riffs hitting harder and the instrumentation being clearer and certainly more steeped in the punk side of grindcore. Fear not, the blast beats and growled vocals are here, but it certainly more a thrashcore sound rather than the straight-up grind of the opposite side. The riffing here isn't as metallic and tight, but it's more melodic (relatively) and has a sense of actual songwriting. But, it's still not great. The blast sections are noisy and can be tough to handle on repeated listening. It feels amateurish as well, like maybe some more tweaking of the material could've helped this record. Honestly, I think that if the A side was released on its own, it might've made for a solid cult punk album.\n\nBut now, we must discuss the B side.\n\nNow I'll admit it, I did enjoy the B side more upon my initial listens of 'Scum,' mostly because if there's anything truly positive to take away from it, it's that this is what I think old school grindcore sounds like. But that positivity didn't last, as I slowly began to favour the A side more as time went on. The severely downtuned guitar work of Bill Steer and crisp blast beats of Mick Harris do have a gnarly quality to them, but they don't mesh well or compliment each other at all. Steer's an excellent guitar player, and I love his work with Carcass, but here his guitar playing lacks the technical edge that made me a fan of his in the first place. His tone is muddy, almost sludgy, and it comes off as fucking nothing against the drums, easily the best sounding instrument on this side even if the kicks are lud as hell and treble-heavy. The actual bass guitar here is almost nonexistent, buried under the drums and guitar. The songwriting feels lacking and less structured, as if there's more of a focus on taking a primitive death metal sound and filtering through hardcore riffing. It just feels ugly and lackadaisical. The production sounds more like a metal album, and if listened to by its lonesome, you'd swear you'd be hearing some shitty grindcore demo from the early 90's.\n\nBut then, there's the most laughable aspect of this whole album: the vocals. Unfortunately, neither side really comes out on top in terms of their respective vocalists. Nik Bullen's throaty growls squaring off with Lee Dorrian's ugly proto-gutturals. Both are unimpressive, but I'll begrudgingly come forward and say I do prefer Bullen to Dorrian. This may sound like hearsay for someone, for I did give Catherdral's debut album 'Forest of Equilibrium' a perfect 100%. And I stand by that. Dorrian's vocals are more suited for psyched-out doom than hard hitting grind. Here, he sounds ridiculous and it actually made the B side more laughable in hindsight. In that same hindsight, I do feel Bullen's vocals do work better in tandem with the sound. As I've made clear, the A side is far more a punk effort than the B side, and it's clear that the punk influence is present even in that vocal performance. It's not good, but it's far more fitting and suitable for the aggression on display on that side. \n\nI must ultimately conclude that, while the album does have a few minor moments that I do get the occasional kick out of from time to time, 'Scum' just does not hold up. What was once a revolution in sonic brutality and the limits of fast, harsh metal sounds now comes off as painfully underwhelming. Unlike the early work of other bands in similar extreme veins, where the aggression and prowess was still somewhat present and has lifted those albums to a higher plane of acclaim, 'Scum' falls short with each passing year. However, unlike those releases, 'Scum's influence remains, surging and coursing through newer and younger bands who have grown up holding Napalm Death is the high regard, I must admit, they've earned. While I do admire this album for what it has done for music, I cannot say that I personally enjoy this album on any level similar to the one I did when I first heard this album.\n\nNow then... time for a little bonus something.\n\nOk, so the version of 'Scum' I reviewed here is the 2007 remaster, which included a forty-or-so minute long documentary about the early days of Napalm Death and recording of 'Scum,' entitled The Scum Story. This documentary features Mick Harris, the only member to appear on both sides of the album, discussing his time with the band up to and a bit after 'Scum,' along with interviews with Earache head-honcho Digby 'Dig' Pearson, music journalists and artists of various kinds, discussing the impact of the album. Despite it's low-budge quality, and the fact that it pales in comparison to the Cathedral docs Return to the Forest and Ethereal Reflections, as well as the Carcass five-parter The Pathologist's Report, The Scum Story is still a fun watch for metalheads and fans of the album and band. This did a lot to help boost my rating for the album, because it really is a good forty-minute summary of Napalm Death's debut album and their ensuing ascension and cementing into metal history.\n\nEdit: fixed some formatting in the final paragraph.\n",
        "\nThe '90s was a time of reckoning for a lot of classic '80s metal and punk bands. Usually said bands jumped onto a trend and lost any of their identity, stuck to their guns only to fall flat, or ended up producing a magnum opus. Napalm Death were odd in that they not only managed to jump onto a trend (hardcore/groove metal) but then actually made a very respectable transition with Fear, Emptiness, Despair. Sadly though, they couldn't keep up the momentum of that album and in 1996 dropped their worst album. Mind you, for a nadir it's hardly awful, being more forgettable than anything.\n\nTo sum up most of the album's contents it falls squarely into the Chaos A.D./Time Bomb/Far Beyond Driven style, that being a hardcore-informed strain of groove metal, albeit with death growls in place of shouting and nods to other NYHC bands like Helmet or Snapcase. Barring one bonus track on this 2CD ('Antibody') as well as the title track, there are no remnants of the band's classic death/grind hybrid sound at all. None of that darkened, hazy atmosphere of the preceding album is anywhere to be found either - this is probably the most stripped down of ND's groove albums (distinguished by their modern logo), with the riffing being repetitive and textured, clearly designed to be the brutal yet rhythmic and memorable motif of a given song. There aren't even any solos; the riffing as well as the beefy death growls of Barney are the main focuses here.\n\nAnd it's with this stripped down focus that the album largely fails. Barney is his usual self, with a particularly hardcore-infused take on the death growl with a percussive quality that this style demands, so he isn't at fault. The real problem is the music itself. Now, while I can appreciate that some time was spent crafting this album, with everything being meticulously performed and the energy levels remaining high throughout, I can also say that the music here pretty much falls flat. Very few of these riffs, and therefore by extension these songs, are memorable at all. Nothing really sticks, which is a big problem for a riff-driven album like this. The most memorable part is in fact the drum performance; what it lacks in blasting it makes up for by being a continuously rolling, shifting mass that dictates the direction of the music that also manages not to distract from the main show (the guitars and vocals.)\n\nIt's not all bad though, and some tracks clearly stand out to me in one way or another. This album marks the first time the band would throw in a 'dirge' - a slower, experimental song which is akin to ambient music in its construction (layers being added and removed over time, slowly evolving the song) that features dissonant, sustained chords. In this case said song is 'Cold Forgiveness', and it manages to work to this album's strength of textured, monolithic riffing, as well as featuring a much needed change of pace in both the music and Barney's spoken word performance. And in spite of myself, the rather infamous 'Cursed to Crawl' is a winner to me as well, having some of the most memorable and well-written riffing on the album and a more varied vocal performance (even if it is quasi-rapped(!)) The opener is quite the shock as well - with its bright, melodic and memorable riffing as well as its catchy nature 'Greed Killing' is probably the single best song ND made during this period and is easily their most distinctive.\n\nHowever, apart from other songs like 'Self Betrayal' (another dirge on the 2CD) and 'My Own Worst Enemy' (which has fairly distinctive riffing and rhythms) this album simply doesn't work all that well. For something so focused on being memorable and textured very few of the songs actually achieve this goal. Nothing on the album is bad, but at the same time not a lot of it is inherently good given what the band were going for. It's well worth it for 'Greed Killing' and even 'Cursed to Crawl', and the album is pretty cool while it's on but ultimately it leaves you wanting of something more than the wall of stock groove riffs and death growls it constantly pushes to the forefront.\n",
        "\nWhy did I give this split a 100? Well, maybe because of its humorous value. Musically, this has NOTHING to offer. Napalm Death's side has You Suffer, which was enlisted on the Guiness World Book Records as the shortest song ever made, and the second side has the thrashcore band Electro Hippies which is almost as twice as long as the first song. This split has exactly two drum beats, two power chords, and one mumbled vocal line. That's it. The production in the two tracks is actually pretty decent (and yes, you can hear the differences)- the Electro Hippies song (or chord) has a thicker production than the rawer Napalm Death, but both have a sense of rawness for both being 80's -core bands.\n\nSo that's about it. This is how this single could be summarized- two different power chords, two drum beats, and a mumbled vocal line. As simple as it gets. The only reason this split exists, is to probably to take a shit on the music industry and of cultural standards of music. This split is the equivalent of modern art in music- no one gets the point it, but some of it has a certain deepness (which most modern art lacks). These two bands made fucking history with this single, and in terms of revolutionary music, this is obviously one of the best examples. Recommended for people who think that painting one line in a 2X2 canvas is art, or just for fans of musical comic value.\n",
        "\nTalking about one of the most iconic grindcore/death metal bands out there is indeed a tough thing. Not only do you have to look at their entire discography spanning over two-and-a-half decades, but how their sound has changed and evolved over the years. One of the very few extreme metal bands who have been around for almost 30 years (from 2017 onwards) and are just as potent and lethal as ever before. Sure you may dislike their new releases for which reasons (it all does boil down to individual musical tastes after all) but there\u2019s no fucking way in hell you can deny the simple fact that these guys have shown absolutely no signs of slowing down or ageing, kicking ass all across the globe. A damn shame they haven\u2019t come down to India yet, but hopefully that will soon be remedied in the (near) future. \n\nEven though I haven\u2019t had any favourites, I have to say that all their albums post Enemy Of The Music Business (putting aside their classic era of course) have kicked my ass pretty much seven ways to Sunday. Having said that, this is pretty much the only album which kicks my ass from start to finish relentlessly pounding away at my skull till only fractured bone shards remain over a bloody husk. Sorry for the graphic description, but yeah that is what grindcore does to you after all. If you think otherwise, well then you\u2019re wrong. Plain and simple. Just want to put it out there. \n\nIt might sound strange, especially for a grind release but mark my words - as many others have already pointed out, this release truly has its share of diversity and variation spiced up among the super-pounding (read grind) moments on the album. No I certainly don't mean it in a progressive sense, but there are undeniably elements of doom and thrash as well. Also it's kinda hard to describe but the riffs are much darker in nature using unconventional more dissonant patterns combined with the classic riff-fuelled grind approach with plenty of well-timed groovy chugs in the mix as well, just oozing intensity and seething rage in every note. One also can't help but notice the clever usage of ringing chords creating an eerie unsettling effect especially on songs like the title track itself (man, that fucking intro!!), \u201cLife And Limb\u201d (especially towards the end), \u201cLarceny Of The Heart\u201d and \"Fallacy Dominion\". And my word the breakdowns are truly skull-crushing in every sense of the word. Needless to say but still. Listen to \"Work To Rule\", \"Procrastination On The Empty Vessel\" and \"De-Evolution Ad Nauseum\" and tell me if that doesn\u2019t want to make you construct a fucking gun from scratch just so you can unleash all that pent up fury on whomsoever concerned. No kidding. Then again they're called the fucking Gods of grind for a reason. Again there are NO weak songs on this album and for fans of the faster breed of grind, never fear as \"Strongarm\" \u201cFeeling Redundant\u201d, \u201cA No-Sided Argument\u201d and \"Diktat\" amongst many others will rip you several new ones. You might want to dial 911 at this point. Just so you know - at this point it's safe to say you're pretty much done for. \n\nBarney also utilizes a unique technique and approach to his vocals even incorporating a few cleans and spoken vocals adding to the diversity. And of course his shouts and growls are simply monstrous even giving me the chills at times. Listen to \u201cDownbeat Clique\u201d for any further proof. The guitars have got that vicious bite to their already massive tone and the drums sound absolutely epic, destroying everything in sight. The flawless production only heightens the fact that this is probably one of the most cathartic and ravaging albums out there. Age has not slowed them down or deterred these metal stalwarts in the slightest. Make no mistake, the band sounds even more pissed off than ever and will hack you apart piece by piece till you are nothing but bloody slabs of meat on the butchers block. \n\nI think the last sentence pretty much says it all. To sum it up - get this fucking album!!\n",
        "\nWhilst Napalm Death is best known for virtually inventing grindcore, by 1990 they were definitely in the death metal camp. By 1994 there was change in the air again with Fear, Emptiness, Despair. The only problem is the change seemed uninspired and most likely commercially motivated, resulting in an unsatisfactory album.\n\nThe grindcore-infused death metal is still there, but now there is a strong element of groove in the mix. This is unsurprising as groovy metal was quite popular in 1994 with Pantera hitting number 1 on the charts with Far Beyond Driven.\n\nThe result is bland and uninspired. Most of the album is mid paced death metal with some very uninspiring grooves. A lot of the songs such as \"Remain Nameless\" plod along mindlessly. Memorable moments, let alone memorable songs, are few and far between. \n\nGroove metal always required a bouncy production to get that moshy vibe it is known for. Yet the production on Fear, Emptiness, Despair is far too muddy with the guitar riffs blurring into each other. As such it often sounds like uninspired Bolt Thrower with Barney Greenway on vocals. Riffs blur into one another and too often it seems the same riff is played for too long. And at times Barney's vocals blur in with the guitars too. The end result is a boring album that comes across as far too long, even though it is only a mere 45 minutes long.\n\nIn some ways, Napalm Death was a victim of the times and its own success. By 1994, death metal was changing with many bands incorporating new elements into the mix, ranging from groove, to rock, to melody, and even to jazz. To stay successful, Napalm Death needed to add something into the mix to stay at the top of the game.\n\nHowever, they failed and condemned themselves to relative obscurity, playing third-rate groove/death metal for the rest of the 1990s. If one can take anything from Fear, Emptiness, Despair, it is that Napalm Death learned from these experiments and were a much stronger band once they returned to grindcore in the new millennium.\n",
        "\nSometimes, the borderline between comedy and stupidity can be very thin. Watching Jim Carrey imitating Napalm Death on TV can be quite hilarious. You know he is a comedian, he doesn't take things too seriously and he basically gets paid to make people laugh, which is awesome. But when you try to take things out of their context, let's say taking a seemingly perfect torturing device and market it as a musical record meant to be consumed and enjoyed by mentally healthy human beings...that's when you know it's time to visit a decent shrink.\n\nI don't think that extreme music should be retarded in order to be considered as extreme music. There's also a reasonable range of time where you can sound basically the same and repeat an idea before it gets annoying and predictable. Its quite similar to comedy, you cannot establish some sort of comedic pattern and repeat it forever. After the second time you tell the same joke, it's time to move on to the next one. Otherwise, the audience will lose attention and you won't get away with that. So, what happens when you repeat the same joke for the 20th time in the same evening, without any alterations? Well, you release it as a grindcore album!\n\n'From Enslavement to Obliteration' is an esoteric album that can be enjoyed from start to finish by a very specific type of people. This album is the equivalent experience of sitting in a midnight subway with damaged, noisy ventilators at 200mph. After a slow, dragging intro, we are thrown into a seemingly endless loop of half assed riffs and unstoppable blast beats with some low guttural and indecipherable growls at the background. There's basically zero talent in this record. Any kid can pluck some random power chords and occasionally pick the same note up and down through a fuzzy distorted down tuned guitar. The vocals are absolute shit. It's utterly impossible to differentiate between the vowels coming out in this record. I've heard dogs barking clearer than these attempts of sounding like a brutal cookie monster.\n\nIn addition to the mind numbing experience of listening to the same flat blast beats and meaningless riffs combined with indecipherable growls for almost half-hour (assuming you haven't given up), it's all padded in one of the worst recording qualities available. The guitars are way too buried in the mix and have a weak tone, which is basically a perfect outfit for the forgettable, repetitive riffs. The drums are heavily compressed and the vocals are way too loud in the mix. There's absolutely nothing slightly acceptable in this piece of noise.\n\nI guess that some people who claim an enjoyment from such an album are doing it for the purpose of fake self-empowerment that only a unique person could claim to have, which is perfectly fine. I won't lie, this album is truly unique in its continuous, uncompromising effort of sounding heavy and brutal. But after five minutes it ends up being an extremely repetitive, bad produced noise that deserves no artistic recognition. The only reason this album won't get a rounded zero score from me, is that I appreciate the fact that none of the people involved in this project gave up and could actually stand the disgust they created. That is probably the sole admirable aspect in this lousy effort.\n",
        "\nEarlier this year, grindcore legends Napalm Death released their 15th studio album, \u201cApex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat.\u201d Napalm Death have, in my opinion, always managed to put out awesome records, despite their flirtations with other genres and musical approaches. This new full length continues their current trend of infusing different influences into their grinding groundwork they first laid down back in 1987 with \u201cScum.\u201d\n\nWhile their 2012 album, \u201cUtilitarian,\u201d took a large influence from Canadian sci-fi thrashers Voivod, \u201cApex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat\u201d differentiates itself by utilizing a lot of post-punk/dirge-driven parts. The obvious influence here would be the mighty Swans. Napalm Death\u2019s infatuation with Swans goes back to the beginning of the band, and almost every album has had a song that has a clear no-wave approach. This new record has taken that approach to more than just one track, and Napalm Death proudly displays that influence right away with the opening title track. These gloomy dirges poke their head up throughout the record. \u201cDear Scum Landlord\u201d even opens with the lyric \u201cbig strong boss,\u201d which is the title of a track on the debut Swans record. No surprise that the last track of the album, \u201cAdversarial / Copulating Snakes\u201d fits this description as well (and is a very well done closing track too). Musical allusions aside, the tracks that display this influence are strong songs, and are the main reason why this album ends up being one of Napalm Death\u2019s most dynamic records.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of grinding songs on this record as well. After the intro, Napalm Death wastes no time doing what they do best \u2013 playing high speed riffs against lightning fast drums in a punk structure. Tracks like \u201cCesspits\u201d show the band at full grinding speed. Granted, Napalm Death doesn\u2019t write the same kind of grindcore that they did back in the late 80s. There\u2019s definitely some maturation in their approach to grind, which perhaps are learned from their death metal and groove eras in the 90s, as heard in \u201cTimeless Flogging\u201d. The most notable thing in that regard would be their usage of hooks. The chorus of \u201cSmash a Single Digit\u201d won\u2019t take long to get stuck in your head. Shane Embury and Mitch Harris are both competent songwriters, and as the song lengths suggest, they get right to the point.\n\nLyrically, \u201cApex Predatory \u2013 Easy Meat\u201d has a lot of what you\u2019d expect from a grindcore band that\u2019s been singing about socio-political themes throughout their career. Younger folks will probably find something to latch onto with songs about breaking oppression, while older headbangers might relate to a song like \u201cHow The Years Condemn\u201d in regards to its themes of age and trying not to break down over time.\n\nOne thing I did not like about this record is the artwork and layout. It\u2019s honestly an eyesore. The cover art is the least guilty of this, but the artwork within just seems really lame and to me feels like an overall lazy presentation. I expected a lot more considering how well the presentation of \u201cUtilitarian\u201d turned out, thankfully this doesn\u2019t take away from how good the music is.\n\nThe production of this record is in line with what Napalm\u2019s been doing the last 15 years. Handled by Russ Russell, this guy\u2019s recorded every Napalm Death album since \u201cEnemy of the Music Business\u201d in addition to related projects. The sound is modern, but it\u2019s not in modern production hell. Fans of old Napalm Death may not like how this record sounds, as it is a pretty clean recording, but at least it\u2019s not riddled with clicky triggers everywhere.\n\nIt\u2019s truly impressive that Napalm Death have put out so many quality records over their long career, and have managed to stay fresh while doing so. \u201cApex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat\u201d stands up well against their discography. As I mentioned before, fans of exclusively old Napalm Death probably won\u2019t find much here, but anyone who\u2019s enjoyed recent material, or likes when the band does creepy dirge-driven songs, will get something out of this record.\n",
        "\nChances are that even if you don\u2019t like a certain album entitled \u2018Scum\u2019 then you certainly have respect for it. In 1987 a 4 piece band called Napalm Death from Birmingham, UK finally cracked under the weight of politicians shit on their shoulders. They used the lies, promises and nature of the modern world to fuel the ferocity in their provoking debut album; in turn it established the dynasty of Grind Metal. Napalm Death\u2019s lengthy discography spans through grind, groove, thrash and back again but now their fifteenth album sees an approach unlike any other release. While the motive is undoubtedly aimed at the usual capitalism and modernity in human life, it\u2019s refreshing to know that Napalm Death\u2019s music has progressed further than the political idealists they base their music on.\n\nThe album starts gravely as authoritative clean vocals on the title track narrate how humans figuratively tear at each other willingly in a lust for higher power. \u2018Smash A single Digit\u2019 follows with furious wrath which is dominated by the exasperated screams of Mark \u201cBarney\u201d Greenway about the decline in value for human life. While his vocals are livid from start to finish, every song on this album packs a lyrical punch in the face to society. \u2018How The Years Condemn\u2019 frantically describes the realisation that nothing in the world changes for the better. \u2018Cesspits\u2019 is a double entendre that illustrates obvious struggles of living in slum-like conditions but also uses the \u201ccesspits\u201d as a metaphor for more fortunate people equally living and walking in a world of a different kind of shit. And you don\u2019t have to read the lyrics to \u2018Hierarchies\u2019 to see the imagery of an endless societal food chain for supremacy and rule.\n\nEven the instrumentation sounds just as pissed off. The sonic assault of Stubborn Stains\u2019 encompasses the quivering tone of the song with pounding blast beats behind the constant contortion of storming guitars. Even after nearly 30 years, the grind factor is high in certain songs such as \u2018Timeless Flogging\u2019 and \u2018Dear Slum Lord...\u2019 The former has a dark but fast paced rumble to it and the latter, while one of the slowest songs includes a domineering stamp that will undoubtedly snap many necks when heard. The average song length is around two and a half minutes and Napalm Death crams as much heaviness through the grinder (pardon the pun) as they can. Because of the short amount of time some tracks have, there is almost too much to take in at times. \u2018Metaphorically Screw You\u2019 certainly lives up to its title in terms of musicianship. It chaotically speeds along and shifts your attention from the extremity between Mitch Harris and Shane Embury\u2019s heavy breakdowns and wrenching grooves; all of which gnash around the tormenting vocals. \n\nIt\u2019ll either be very easy or rather difficult you understand the basis of \u201cApex Predator: Easy Meat\u201d. Not only will this make you want to punch walls, flip tables and feel like you could take on a rabid and starving bear but it\u2019s also thought provoking and has depth to its meaning. The anti-political, anti-capitalism, anti-everything nature that Greenway expresses on this album, and every live show, ironically summarises Napalm Death\u2019s career: Nothings fucking changed.\n",
        "\nContinuing War on Stupidity blasts out of your speakers, and you know that Napalm Death is definitely back, returning from their 90s experimentation and steamrolling forward with a \"modern\" sound that isn't death metal or grindcore, but some combination of the two which usually works incredibly well. Three minute songs of generally fast riffing along with blast beats, double bass, and d-beat drumming, covered with Barney's recognizable voice are the norm. Order of the Leech is generally faster and more chaotic than its predecessor Enemy of the Music Business, at the expense of a loss of memorability.\n\nQuite simply, very few of these songs are as memorable as the average Napalm Death song in the 21st century, and compared to some of the best songs they've done recently, are made mostly irrelevant. Any and all of these songs would kill live, there is no doubt about this, and the release is more than perfectly serviceable for what you would want out of \"modern\" death metal/grindcore. If you just want to bang your head for 30 minutes, this'll work just fine. But I love Napalm Death for their memorability, for the dozens of songs that are permanently embedded in my mind just because of amazing songwriting and memorability, riffs and otherwise. And these just don't quite make the cut.\n\nThere is no bad song here, just several mediocre songs and a few that stand out. Continuing War on Stupidity works as a fine opener, and the middle section with the mid-paced riffing whilst Barney calls out homage to Celtic Frost is very much satisfying. One has to wonder though if this is simply due to this song's placement first in line that it is remembered, just like how The Great Capitulator as the final song is also particularly memorable.\n\nSandwiched between these two songs are ten songs which mostly run together. I can recall a riff here, a vocal line there, but I probably won't ever remember these songs in their entirety, which I can probably do for the entire Smear Campaign album, for example. It's not really like the songwriting is any different from the previous album or what comes later to any significant degree; somehow with this album, it just comes down to a general lack of memorability. Don't get me wrong, I'm listening to the album right now and in no way not enjoying myself, but if I think back on this listening session in a few hours, I still won't remember how many of these songs start or end, just the general structure of \"fast riffing accompanied with either blast beats, double bass, or d-beats with Barney shouting over top of it all\". Or if I actively remember a riff here or there, I probably won't be able to match it with the song it's in. Slower (well, read \"mid-paced\" since this is Napalm Death after all) moments immediately stick to mind for standing out and being relatively rare (middle of Continuing War on Stupidity, beginning of To Lower Yourself (Blind Servitude), um I'm pretty sure Narcoleptic has a decent mid-paced part in the middle but I already forget what it particularly sounds like, just that it's there...).\n\nThe production is pretty \"chaotic\", more so than Enemy of the Music Business at least. I do own the vinyl version which I recorded in Audacity and imported as MP3s, so I have to admit that the sound is \"slightly different\" than if, say, I listen to these songs on YouTube or somewhere (just due to the nature of vinyl and all of that). (Whether that is affecting my opinion of the album as opposed to if I had bought a CD and had exposure that way, I do not know.) Oh hey, another admittedly catchy moment: the fade-out of Lowest Common Denominator leading right into the beginning stomp of Forewarned Is Disarmed? is memorable enough. But now that the song is going and fast and all, all I can say is \"Yeah, the guitar strings are being strummed in various patterns really fast and stuff\", and I really can't say much else. I get the feeling that a slightly different guitar tone could have increased the memorability factor of these riffs a little bit. But back to the production, it's modern without being \"too much\", not much else to say about it.\n\nThis is still a perfectly fine album for the (modern) Napalm Death fan, but all of its siblings are simply better remembered. I would probably skip this album entirely if making a modern Napalm Death compilation for a friend (maybe The Great Capitulator would be tacked on since it has the funny \"Total Black Trash Grind Freak from the Czech Republic\" skit tacked on at the end). With a few songs to go everything is still mostly going through one ear and out the other, not making a strong lasting impression. I'm glad things will end on a strong note with The Great Capitulator, but this will probably remain my least reached-for modern Napalm Death album. I do prefer it to Utopia Banished and Words from the Exit Wound though (Fear, Emptiness, Despair and Distribes of course also get beat), which both also seem to lack the memorability factor that Napalm Death usually brings to the table.\n\nShould the modern Napalm Death fan get this? It was my most recently acquired 21st century Napalm Death album, partially due to completion considerations, and it ranks below Enemy of the Music Business and everything from The Code... and forward as well. So... yes, but don't expect it to become a favorite.\n",
        "\nI don\u2019t think a new Napalm Death album will lead to increased seismic activity due to a sudden barrage of jaws hitting the floor. The grindcore/death metal classics have come and gone, but Napalm Death at least has proven itself capable of retching up some fine records late in the game\u2014\u201cSmear Campaign\u201d and \u201cThe Code Is Red... Long Live the Code,\u201d especially, come to mind. \u201cApex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat\u201d pulls a George W. Bush and stays the course on Napalm Death\u2019s musical Iraq, so to speak. Foreign anomalies drifting from the raucous mass of grindcore are, as expected, nearly nonexistent, though \u201cApex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat,\u201d while more limited than the average latter-day Napalm Death album, still does what it does quite well.\n\nOut of the many admirable traits still lingering in the heart of UK\u2019s grindcore overlords, the passion in these tracks stands out the most. The technical proficiency and breakneck paces of the band still work to keep the blood pumping, and Barney, a top-tier vocalist with some of the most unique barks ever put down on tape, sounds excellent as always. Most of \u201cApex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat\u201d falls directly under the grindcore blanket Napalm Death spent the last thirty-five years weaving with blast beats and fury. Some of these songs are surprisingly enjoyable, namely the early burst of the catchy \u201cSmash a Single Digit\u201d and the complex sequences of \u201cMetaphorically Screw You.\u201d Familiar territory, but far from redundant, even for a band that has an ungodly amount of unique cuts penned at this point. Traditional Napalm Death fare has yet to expire from spoilage. \n\nSome of these songs, however, naturally fall flat from the retracing act. Bits and pieces of the record\u2019s second half especially go in one ear and out the other without making too much of an impression. This, again, is due to having such an extensive catalog in the grindcore niche; they\u2019ve done some of this stuff before. Not horrible tunes, but certainly limited. I find myself enjoying the odd ones here, specifically the eerie, crawling riffs of \u201cDear Slum Landlord,\u201d a track similar to \u201cMorale\u201d and other slow ones. \u201cHierarchies\u201d is another keeper, probing a mid-paced route and finished off by a rare guitar solo and a chant-like chorus. \u201cAdversarial / Copulating Snakes\u201d ends the album in monstrous fashion, as the screamed vocals and twisting riffs make it a solid way to shut the whole thing down.\n\nThe chant-laden industrial number kicking off \u201cApex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat\u201d works as a nice introduction, although I would have enjoyed hearing this scheme used to improve the lesser tracks to help build them up a bit. Not too much to gripe about when it comes down to the meat and potatoes of \u201cApex Predator \u2013 Easy Meat,\u201d as the Napalm Death enterprise once more proves itself satisfactory. The songs branching out from the typical Napalm Death equation are more memorable and of higher quality than the usual grindcore explosion, but the band is so comfortable and sharp in their natural setting that they can still walk away with a winner on their hands, despite the occasional lemon. \n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nNapalm death delivers the heavy metal community another solid album. This album musically is mostly a nonstop assault of heavy grindcore and death metal laced with lyrical themes of social disorder, corruption and psychological unrest. \n\nBarney Greenway's vocals on this album are very harsh. His vocals have been similar on each album in Napalm Death's discography. The guitar tone on this album is loud, heavy, and dirty. Which complements the albums atmosphere of chaos and fury. Although the bass tone is kinda quiet, it provides a nice foundation for the guitars and the vocals. The drums on this album are standard for extreme metal. I enjoyed the snare sound on this album, But the double bass patterns and cymbal crashes get overbearing at some points in the album, especially on some points on the more straight forward grindcore tracks. \n\nThe atmosphere on this album is chaotic, disordered, and frantic. This album would be a perfect soundtrack for a riot or some kind of rebellion against a corrupt authority. The composition and flow of this album enriches the album to sound more controlled and well assembled. Songs like \"Hierarchies\" and \"Dear Slum Landlord\" have lyrical themes of rebellion and anti-government ideologies, which when combined with the music, gives a very nice realistic flow and atmosphere.\n\nI have a couple of things that I found dissatisfying about this album though. First, is the production. The production seems very clustered at some points. The clustered production is especially prevalent in the faster moments in this album, which this makes the drums sound too loud and drowns out the bass, guitar and vocals. \n\nThe other problem I had with this album was the first track \"Apex Predator- Easy Meat\". This song provides no significance to the album. It has these weird Gregorian chants and drum sounds which makes a really awkward industrial vibe throughout the track. I think this album would feel a lot more complete if it started with a with a strong track reminiscent to Napalm Death's previous releases.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd recommend this album to you if you enjoy Napalm Death's trademark grindcore sound. this album continues to rekindle that signature sound while throwing in a couple new stylistic elements. Although there are some problems which I stated in this review, it would stop you from enjoying this album.\n",
        "\nFor the past decade, the members of Napalm Death have been continually revitalizing their career and my interest in the band by cranking out exceptional releases that rival their early work. While Napalm Death could choose to coast on its legacy and continue to tour on a \"greatest hits\" set list, the band instead keeps cranking out solid albums filled with energetic songs that eclipse the efforts of bands half its age. \n\nNapalm Death's latest, Apex Predator - Easy Meat, is no different. The songs have the same energy and quality that we have come to expect from the recent string of Napalm Death albums. The band manages to make noise that's catchy, though it may take several listens to grasp. The album kicks off with industrial pounding and strange chanted vocals, but shortly thereafter Napalm Death plows straight into its trademarked sound. A great deal of the album consists of the band's typical blasting grind chaos and punky guitar chords. At times, eerie dissonance and ringing chords provide some breathing room before the band returns to blasting away. Intermittent straightforward chugging provides respite as well and gives the listener a chance to groove along before the proceedings descend back into barely-controlled chaos. These brief moments of relief not only make the album endurable, but also make it extremely enjoyable. \n\nIt's likely that the songs are so memorable because there are three different guys contributing to the writing and bringing their own styles to the table. Aside from the fact that the music is catchy in its own right, there's a wealth of vocal variety that gives the songs plenty of distinction. Greenway, Harris, and Embury all contribute vocally and provide the album with not only the standard growls and screams, but also chanting, sickly moans, and unsettling groans. \"Dear Slum Landlord\" and \"Hierarchies\" are both good examples of the creepy vocal varieties while \"Stunt Your Growth\" has an oddly-layered effect. Of course no matter how the lyrics are delivered, Napalm Death continues to rail against the injustices of the world. \n\nWith Apex Predator - Easy Meat, Napalm Death succeeds at the challenging job of making noisy chaos into something catchy. The band manages to make the off-kilter and queasy actually seem appealing. Apex Predator - Easy Meat may be essentially more of the same when compared to the band's work from the past decade, but when it's this good, one really can't complain. Fans of the band's recent output need to snatch this up. Old fans who strayed during the band's mid-career slump might want to check back in and see what they've been missing. Apex Predator - Easy Meat is a truly timeless flogging. \n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalpsalter.com\n",
        "\nI'll say it bluntly: this album is garbage, but it's garbage that apparently inspired a lot of bands to make good music, so I guess that is why it's considered a classic. \n\nLet's start off with the most important aspect about music: the songwriting. On this album, I doubt there ever was a songwriting process. Just take a look at the song lengths: there are 28 songs, and the album is 33 minutes long. There just is not enough substance you can get out of a song with an average length of roughly one minute. Buildup? Structure? None of this to be found here. The songs hardly consist of more than one or two riffs, if you can even call them riffs. It's mostly just a lot of fuzz with some stupidly fast, sloppy drumming on top. Listen to the first four songs and you can pretty much skip the rest of the album, because the songs all sound identical. \u201cInstinct of Survival\u201d for example consists of two parts: a groove-tinged mid-tempo riff and a fast blast-beat part typical for grindcore (a new thing back in '87). It's hard to differentiate between the songs because they are built and sound so similarly. \n\nNapalm Death is mostly known for You Suffer, and this song is a total joke. A one second-long assault of the ears, leaving you wondering \u201cwhat the hell was that?!\u201d. The Kill, Parasites or Common Enemy, for example, aren't that different, just a tad longer, this time around 20 seconds of static with blast-beats. Parasites deserves a special mention though, because one of the guitarists (Bill Steer even, if I'm not mistaken) actually tries to do a tiny solo here... and man, does it sound crap. Just random notes played as quickly as possible, much like early Kreator. The title-track is probably the best song here, churning out some actually decent and catchy riffs. This just shows that this album is at its best when it's not actually trying to be as fast and brutal and possible, but rather when it decides to focus on these kind of riffs that Slayer write when they play slower songs.\n\nOne of the other (very few) redeeming factors are the lyrics, some of which are admittedly pretty good. Really well-written, intelligent lyrics that deal with globalisation, fascism, society and many other themes in a way that kind of reminds me of Discharge. But I fear that alone can't save this album...\n\nThe vocals are absolutely atrocious, very weak screams/growls/grunts, extremely monotonous and boring to listen to. I find it hard to believe that the great Lee Dorrian is associated with such awful music, but it seems he's on here and he just sounds as bad as the other vocalist, Nicholas Bullen. You can't really call this a Napalm Death album, because none of the present members, or people we connect to the name Napalm Death, for that matter, are present here. The actual musicians here do a terrible job, the guitar does overly simplistic, lame riffs consisting of two or three notes, the bass is distorted beyond belief and sounds like total shit (just listen to the intro of \u201cPolluted Minds\u201d) , and the drumming is, as already stated, sloppy at best. This is the very first grindcore album, and you can notice that immediately, the sound is hardly any better than your average shitty raw bedroom black metal project.\n\nI fear this album hasn't aged well at all. I can imagine this was amazing when it first came out, because there (hardly) has been a band playing music this fast and raw before. This was the \u201cpeak\u201d of hardcore punk and resulted in creating a brand new genre, grindcore. But now, as of today, this doesn't have a lot in store apart from the nostalgic factor and the lyrics maybe. I also think that the fatal flaw of this album is actually the production quality. It's hard to make out the actual riffs beneath the overpowering drums and unintelligible vocals and that's why this album fails so hard. So, get this if you're a die-hard Napalm Death and/or grindcore fan and you want to know the roots (or really like extremely raw and blunt music), but if you're not one of those, don't waste your time and money. I give this band credit for trying something so new and daring and I love Napalm Death, but this album is just not what you would want from them.\n",
        "\nOne of metal's many bands that requires no introduction, the almighty Napalm Death, have, true to their ethos of consistency, released another solid collection of politically-charged grindcore mayhem. It cannot be denied that Embury and co. have never really stuck a foot out of line - from the vulgar blast of \"Scum\" right through to the more structurally extended \"Time Waits For No Slave\". Musically, the grind legend's 2015 release can be seen as a tactical step backwards - but the ideology and atmosphere behind the music pushes the band relentlessly forward.\n\nThe atmosphere I refer to is one of uneasy disquietude and inevitable dread. The excellent title-track is what sets up this convention, and is easily the greatest intro of the decade; both anxiously exciting and beautifully disturbing. It prepares the listener perfectly for the inaugural fury of the album's first single: \"Smash A Single Digit\"; a minute and a half throwback to the glorious \"From Enslavement...\" days. Despite the fact that the chorus is simply the title repeated over and over, Barney throws in enough rhythmic variety to keep it interesting - such is the success of similar tracks like \"How The Years Condemn\" and \"Adversarial\".\n\nThe production does a stirring job of maintaining the atmosphere. The kit is heightened by a metallic clang, the guitar/bass combo is vicious and buzzsaw-esque, and Barney's vocals are crushingly malicious, as per usual. I've heard some complaints about effects being applied to the vocals, but he sounds just as brutal onstage so I have no idea what evidence those claims are based on.\n\nIt's refreshing to hear the veterans continue to experiment with unusual sounds. The previously-mentioned title-track contains some eerie vocal warblings which reminds one of Gregorian chanting. The dirge-like \"Dear Slum Landlord\" is oddly sludgy, and makes for a welcome change of pace. And the irregular, almost jazzy time signatures that are sprinkled throughout the album are entertaining to say the least. \n\n\"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\" is a brief affair - almost disappointingly so. I understand grindcore is never a genre renowned for its extensive and drawn out structures, but Napalm Death might be doing themselves a disservice by stepping back towards the shorter, violent bursts that populated their debut. Both \"Utilitarian\" and \"Time Waits...\" displayed their capabilities to push the envelope of grindcore. However, this newest release remains satisfying, despite the lack of progression. Probably because Napalm Death achieved 'legendary' status a while ago and are beyond such qualms.\n\nFrom the original cover art, through the political ideologies, right to the chunky barrage of dissonant riffage and controlled blast beats - this is good ol' Greenway and co. at their most frenzied. Napalm Death never require an introduction, and this album doesn't require my recommendations for you to get out there and purchase it. Give them your money - but avoid the multinational corporations, if you know what's good for you.\n\nTenderize chunks of a weakling.\nClaim on bare bones for bleaching.\nThousand-yard stares for the meeting.\n",
        "\nSome review somewhere else of \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\" mentioned \"progressive metal influences\"? Um, really, are you kidding? This album is exactly what you would expect from modern Napalm Death, to no fault. Sounds like an extension of \"Utilitarian\" which was an extension of the album before that, and so on, probably going back to \"The Code...\". If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?\n\nThe production is pretty similar to that of \"Utilitarian\", suitably modern and in-your-face, maybe a bit too much in the way of effects on Barney's vocals (a common criticism of recent Napalm), but all is as it should be, and these guys aren't exactly young.\n\nEvery modern Napalm Death album, while similar enough to what came before it to be familiar, is unique enough in its own way. \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\" sees perhaps an easing of the foot onto the brakes a little bit, as we have a more overall \"mid-paced\" (well, mid-paced for ND anyway) feel to things. Tracks like \"Smash a Single Digit\" join recent songs like \"Rabid Wolves (for Christ)\" and \"Nom De Guerre\" in being a 21st century re-imagination of the \"From Enslavement to Obliteration\" sound, but on the whole many songs here are more comparable to an \"On the Brink of Extinction\" or \"Fall on Their Swords\": running with your \"Celtic Frost\" mid-paced riffage, to try to be general. \"Cesspits\" in particular draws from the previously two mentioned songs (I can't help but feel them to be linked), but still easily avoids being labeled a \"self rip-off\" or whatever.\n\nModern Napalm Death has to involve some \"experimentation\", lately generally involving \"clean\" vocal parts, suitably layered to get that \"Gregorian chant\" sound going, and \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\" is no exception to this. See the intro/title track (great track in the vein of a \"Multinational Corporations\" or especially an \"Evolved as One\"), \"Dear Slum Landlord...\", and the chorus of \"Heirarchies\" (the song probably supporting the best of those mid-paced, catchy riffs I've spoken of). Also see (less experimentation and more just \"something different\") the beginning of \"Beyond the Pale\" for a \"duet\" (as I heard it described elsewhere) between Barney's grunts and Mitch's screams (modern ND has plenty of instances of perfectly-placed vocal lines and tradeoffs between these two guys, but here it's a little different than what we're used too, and works greatly).\n\nLike any modern ND release, three or four of these songs will become permanently imbedded in your head. These guys are just damn good songwriters, and write choruses better than most pop artists/songwriters. Good luck getting the choruses to \"Smash a Single Digit\", \"How the Years Condemn\", \"Hierarchies\", or \"Adversarial\" out of your head. It doesn't even matter that three of those four are just the song titles repeated a few times. The background instrumentation and Barney's and/or Mitch's inimitable vocals get the job done. These would all work excellently in the live setting, get the whole crowd screaming along.\n\nThat's about all there is to say really. If you enjoy any Napalm Death release from this century (maybe specifically since \"The Code...\" as I feel that's where they really solidified this sound), don't hesitate to purchase \"Apex Predator - Easy Meat\". It's familiar without sounding stagnant in any way, will scratch any ND itch that \"Smear Campaign\" or \"Utilitarian\" can, and just proves that this band is one of the most consistent metal bands that is still running and touring strong. Long live Napalm Death.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the first full length grindcore albums ever made. So what do you expect from it, are you expecting something so legendary that it saw the rise of a whole genre, or do you see the rough draft and blueprints of a genre that is waiting to be perfected? I personally saw this as the latter.\n\nIn every way it sticks very closely to its punk roots, in fact the influences of punk outweigh the influences of metal by a considerable margin. The basic simplicity, the pure raw power, many DIY (do it yourself) aspects, the extremely short song lengths. All of these commonly associated with hardcore punk. The whole existence of the music itself can be summed up to trying to blurt out your political views in the loudest and angriest form possible. Any semblance of songwriting comes second to the expression of ideas and emotions. It is however very heavy and that by itself is inevitably going to draw the attention of metalheads.\n\nThe vocals are all about this style that is somewhere between a growl and a shout. He rarely ceases to use it, like growling it can be tricky making out what is being said, but for those with the patience or a lyric book you'll find the lyrics are very typical to the hardcore punk scene.\n\nThe production is about as muddy as it gets. The guitars are done mostly done in the lower range and have the sole purpose of being heavy and loud. The sound that is generated is very deep and very fast. The riffing is simple. Again very reminiscent of punk. Every once in awhile though they throw in a solo that shows quite a bit of skill, enough so to show that the man has a fair level of instrumental mastery (Parasites).\n\nThe bass is mostly drowned out. The tuning on the guitar is low enough that rather then merely rounding out the sound (which it still does) it adds in its own 'melodic' layer (Prison Without Walls). When he pokes his way through the production to a point where he can clearly be heard he fights with the guitarist for your attention and often times he wins.\n\nThe drums do better in the production, while still muddied up you can hear it very clearly. It seems as if every strike on the bass, snare and cymbals can be heard pretty easily, can't say as much for the toms but the whole album seems as drum centric as you can get without cutting everything else out. His favorite thing to do are his blast beats which are used almost relentlessly. He doesn't do much double pedal in preference for more punkish beats but when he does use them they are well executed (Moral Crusade).\n\nTypically these songs would seem completely undeveloped, however in the case that these songs are a political idea wrapped in sound you can hear that these tracks are as well developed as they need to be. True its kind of weak to have a 40 second song, never mind having 20 of them, but this music was made for completely different purposes and ideas then metal or even typical music in general. Each song is merely a piece of a longer idea. My best suggestion would be to listen to the album as a whole, nothing on here besides maybe Scum and Siege of Power would work in a stand alone fashion anyway.\n",
        "\nWhat we have here is easily a cash grab of sorts by Earache. Really, I'm not even sure there needs to be much more said about the album than that. I found this split for a dollar and some change at a local record store and, since it had been so long since I've purchased wax, I figured I'd give it a go. Afterall, I adore Insect Warfare and Napalm Death is the entire reason I'm into extreme metal. A combination of the two seemed novel, right? Like, let's take two tracks from Napalm Death's debut and then two tracks from Insect Warfare's only album to chronicle the genre of grindcore! That's not a terrible idea - but I think I would have much liked to hear new stuff from both bands - or maybe Napalm Death covers of Insect Warfare and vice versa? Now that'd be a tight split and definitely worth seeking out. \n\nBut, as it is, the album is divided into two parts - Napalm Death's \"rough cuts\" from Scum and Insect Warfare's pre-mastered tracks from World Extermination. We all know Napalm Death's classics - \"Scum\" and \"Control\" are the entire foundation of the genre - a groundbreaking and entirely new sound to punk and metal. Taking all of the aggression of hardcore and punk with the sheer violence and unmatched sonic fury of metal, Napalm Death single-handedly created some of the heaviest and most badass music of the 80s. Scum is right up there with Realm of Chaos for my all time favorite albums, and had a massive influence on my aesthetic choice, my drumming style, and hell, even my politics. \"Control\" is the more grounded of the two, having a much more hardcore sound than a fully realized metallic one - and it packs about three or four brutal riffs within it's extremely short length. \"Scum\" needs no introduction, but that opening riff, the slow plodding power chords with drum fills beneath it, is one of the most intimidating openers ever. Right when the riff comes to a screeching halt, you're ready for violence - and then man, does that pay off. When that grind kicks in, it's pure, unfiltered aggression. Classic for a reason. \n\nInsect Warfare, on the other hand, are considered by some to be one of, if not the best, current grindcore band. Unlike a lot of other big names or modern grinders, there actually isn't a lot of outside influences. They don't have a weird noise/screamo side, they don't have death metal influences, they don't have goregrind influences - they just play straight up grindcore. It's pretty sweet to hear those hardcore riffs run through metallic sounds, and honestly, Earache couldn't have picked two better songs off of the album. \"Necessary Death\" and \"Manipulator\" are intense, ferocious, and feature just incredibly violent explosive moments and some of Insect Warfare's harshest vocal deliveries. Seeing as both songs fun a little under two minutes, there's not a ton to say other than the fact that every single riff is well placed and really does kick ass. \n\nSo, the low score isn't because the music is bad - it obviously isn't - it's some of my favorite stuff of all time mixed with some of my favorite stuff currently. It's just that I have a really hard time figuring out who this is for. I could see this handed out at a concert - or if you preordered something, but as a standalone release, it just comes off as capitalizing off of a recent trend towards grind, just a year or two late. It's that cash grabbing action and attitude that would leave both Insect Warfare's and Napalm Death's heads spinning.\n",
        "\nI'm not familiar with this genre and these guys are considered on of the founders of grindcore. I'll admit, at first I thought this album was trash. Poor sound quality, short songs, and quite confusing. It is definitely not for everyone. If you don't like this album now, you most likely won't ever like it. I just happened to have a change of heart. \n\nFrom an Instrumental standpoint, complexity is not their forte. The riffs are extremely basic. This doesn't necessarily make it bad. They're catchy, but if you're driven away by the insane amount of distortion on the guitars, you most likely won't appreciate them, or the whole album. But, if you can look past the sound quality, you'll most likely enjoy the riffs very much. The drumming is very fast, but off beat for the most part. If you're looking for smooth and rhythmic drumming, you won't like this. Again, this album isn't for everyone. In my opinion, the fast, and almost careless, do what you want feel, is what made me love this album. \n\nLyrically, this album is focused on politics and they make a convincing argument in where, and why they believe what they believe. These lyrics may bore some people, but interest me considering I have a similar opinion. Their lyrics may be the only thing to keep some positive feedback on the people who hate the instrumentals, but agree with them politically. The vocals on the other hand, are pretty much white noise. Beautiful, heavy, and fast white noise. Don't bother matching the lyrics with the vocals. It simply won't happen.\n\nYou have to just accept the fact that this album is basic, fast, heavy, and pretty crazy sounding. This is the epitome of grindcore and a great album to introduce you to the genre. I enjoy the commotion created within the album. Overall, I love it. Even though it's basic, it has a great sound,, it's catchy, and contains lyrical genius. I can't stress enough that it is not for everyone. You've been warned.\n",
        "\nAs maligned as Napalm Death's mid-period has become, one simple truth remains: the best songs of that era were tucked away on their various splits and singles. Whereas the full-lengths often fucked around with pointless experimentation and plodding hardcore grooves, these seemingly forgotten b-sides often delivered exactly what those albums were missing: bracing blasts of intense death-grind. \n\nReleased as a teaser to the forthcoming (and mostly mediocre) Inside The Torn Apart, this EP (technically a split) offers up a radio friendly album single partnered with four sharp death-grind leftovers, songs so strong that they should've made the album. I don't hate \"Breed To Breathe\" per se, though I recognize just how commercial it sounds: a very slick, catchy, and bouncy riff with Barney's barking vocals overlaid and a super pit-friendly break beat underneath. A song that will definitely get a crowd moving, especially the d-beat bridge into the heavy breakdown chorus. Is it a little too slick and cloying, owing more to Snapcase than Sore Throat? Yes, but I can't argue that it isn't well-constructed and somewhat enjoyable. You'll get more of the same on the actual album but if you've been missing more old-school N.D., the next few tracks will balm your wounds a bit.\n\nWhile granting that all four of these b-sides have the same sugary production (very clean, bright guitar tones, clear bass, and snappish drums), the track constructions are of a less commercial nature. \"All Intensive Purposes\" is mid-paced and groovy but in a harsher, more tom-heavy (think Obituary circa World Demise) manner. Barney's voice is lower here too, layering over the guitars in a much heavier manner. \"Stranger Now\" does that shuffle/break beat intro into slammin' breakdown thing at first but there's a deadly morph halfway through into that classic grind tornado N.D. blast-mania that was so often missing during these wilderness years. \"Bled Dry\" is even better, forgoing the groove touches entirely and going straight hybrid death-grind, lots of chunky mid-paced riffage, bruising double-bass, and rabid backing vocals from Shane and Mitch. Even \"Time Will Tell,\" a more atmospheric mid-paced number, churns with a simmering hostility and energy I often found absent on the full-lengths.\n\nFoolishly, Earache decided to hold a promotional contest allowing unsigned bands to submit their covers of N.D. songs, the winner of which would have their version included on this promo. The 'winner' here is a band called Fatality but the 'loser' is the listener as this is one shit cover. Fatality butcher one of N.D.'s best tunes with a lifeless cover that sounds like the soundtrack to an N.E.S. game with someone retching into a toilet for vocals. Utterly putrid, useless, and stupid. \n\nNapalm Death: \"Breed To Breathe\" et al: 80%\nFatality: \"Suffer The Children (cover): 30%\nTotal: 55%\n",
        "\nI interned at a college radio station in high school and it had a huge impact on my musical life because I got access to the station's musical archive as well as their discard bin. Into the discard bin went most of the extreme music promos as the station had no dedicated underground hardcore/punk/metal show at the time and I pilfered from that bin big time. One item I distinctly remember picking up was this Napalm Death/At The Gates split promo. I was already a big fan of Napalm Death but At The Gates were entirely new to me. At the time, this split had a big impact on me but that impact has lessened considerably with age. The distance of time and perpetual re-releasing of material by both bands has rendered most of the material on here inert.\n\nNapalm Death promo two songs off their Diatribes album coupled to two rarer b-sides. Like most of the music from this era in ND's history, the b-side material is far superior to the album cuts. \"Cursed To Crawl\" is one of the worst songs in N.D. history and an unfortunate choice to start things off here. I distinctly remember being unimpressed the first time I heard N.D. try and emulate bands like Helmet and Prong, complete with start-stop staccato riffing and slightly-filtered clean vocals. \"Take The Strain\" isn't much better, the Helmet influence is even more pronounced in the riffing, though Barney's gruff vocals are thankfully back out front cuz without them, you'd be hard pressed to even guess this is Napalm Death. \"Food Chains\" and \"Politics Of Common Sense\" are so much better. Both songs have that sickening lurch of the F.E.D. recordings complete with ugly guitar tone and harsh double-bass grooves more akin to Obituary. These songs definitely feel like pre-Diatribes recordings and were super-rare until the Noise For Music's Sake comp came out.\n\nAs for At The Gates, they were completely new to me at the time and my opinions coming out of my initial listens were totally uninformed, though I still think that gut reaction is credible. Not knowing the band's history, I felt like I was listening to an unfortunate Heartwork style Carcass clone. Tomas Lindberg's screeching scream-shouts did not appeal to me at all (and I still don't like his ATG style nearly as much as when he fronts grind or crust) and the slicker-than-slick production really turned me off. The two tracks from Slaughter Of The Soul had elements I could dig, particularly in the riffs, but mostly I was turned off by the vocals, very stock drums, and cheesy production. As with N.D., I much preferred the b-sides: \"Legion\" pummels more like Deicide and showcased deeper vox and more varied drumming. \"The Dying\" too is monstrous in the riff department but again I am turned off by the vocals and drums. ATG just didn't click with me and in the years since that has remained the case personally.\n\nI held on to this split for a long time but stopped playing it aside from those rare N.D. tracks. Now the disc is worthless as everything once exclusive to it has surfaced elsewhere. Had ATG really struck me, I might still be grateful for the introduction and in some ways I am given I have since enjoyed vocal work by Tomas Lindberg for Lock-Up and Skitsystem. \n\nNapalm Death: 56%\nAt The Gates: 43%\nOverall: 49.5% (rounded up)\n",
        "\nOld Napalm Death is dead, long live old Napalm Death. As much as I like this album, nothing equates to 'Harmony Corruption' or even 'From Enslavement To Obliteration.' The early grind days were great, so was 'Scum' and 'The Peel Sessions.' I mean if you want chronic crazy blast beating with grind/noise, then old Napalm Death is for you. But here, they take on much more of a death metal oriented style, which isn't bad, just don't expect to hear any of what was featured on the early grind years. There are some blast beating going on, but it's solid musically and they've definitely progressed, but lacked the extremity that was retained on older stuff.\n\nI'd have to say that I was expecting to hear just utter crap on this album, but I was sadly mistaken. ND really delivers with the riffs here and keeps you interested the whole way through, even though it is slower. I still think that it ranks in a good rating despite what other critics of the band think. I think that this is a really solid put-together and everything seemed to flow fluently on here. No real objections, just the intensity. The music is way slowed down and definitely a more solid production than earlier days. It's good that Jesse was on this one too along with Barney, Mitch and the newer drummer Danny.\n\nDefinitely think that if Mick Harris was still with ND, I don't think that he'd let them slow down. But Mick doesn't even play the drums anymore and only owns a pair of drumsticks. If you caught 'Live Corruption', he said that their musical ability was getting better which it was, but why did he have to leave the band? That really created a lot of turmoil between him and Mitch. I doubt that they even talk anymore. I remember them having a quarrel about a year and a half ago on Facebook. It wasn't pretty. Mick kept them extreme and I think Mitch wanted a more death metal oriented ND which is what's featured here.\n\nNot saying at all that the band members slacked off on their musical performance here. They captivate the listener with pure in your face death metal. I really like this album because it's just different. Somewhat groove oriented with the riffs, not a whole lot of backup screams by Mitch here, and good that Jesse was still alive to keep them doing what they do best--kill on the guitars. There aren't a lot of tremolo picking on the riffs here, there's more chords and fast picking, kind of like some groove thrash. Barney displays a little bit of clean measures here, but really brief. The production quality was really really solid.\n\nNo complaints on this one, just don't expect that much fast blasting. Expect a more death metal ND, not grindcore or even death/grind. Just mostly death metal. It's really noteworthy and the music really sticks. Awesome what they were able to produce here. There is SOME tremolo picking going on, but not blasting. I think Mick was the fastest blaster ever. Those were the glory days, now onto a newer type of ND, something that I thought would never happen, but it did. They put on one helluva live performance though, even with the newer material and Jesse no longer with the band and living period. Expect diversity.\n",
        "\nThis is vintage Napalm Death at their absolute finest. What an intense and insane musical noise terror. \"Barney\" on vocals coming from Benediction, Shane on bass from Unseen Terror, Jesse via Terrorizor, Mick Harris (who discovered N/D in 1985 at a local pub) and Mitch Harris from Righteous Pigs. All-star cast and intense death/grind genres. The band has changed too much from what they originally started as a grindcore act. With Mick behind the set and \"Barney\" featuring more death metal oriented vocals (also different from nowadays). The band plays 20+ songs on this monumental live concoction. It is really entertaining and well played out the whole way through.\n\nIntensity and love for the extreme music, Napalm Death just kills here. Too bad that Mick left the band back in 1991--they've not been the same without him. I'm not really sure why he left either he only owns a pair of drumsticks now doesn't even play the drums anymore. Mick and Mitch had a falling out some time ago, they had their act called Defecation way back in the early 90's. I suppose Mick just stopped liking the extreme music, 'Harmony Corruption' I think would be their best album ever. What's played on here i.e. 'Live Corruption' is a combination of songs from 'Scum', 'From Enslavement To Obliteration', 'The Peel Sessions' and 'Harmony Corruption.'\n\nReally I need to re-order the actual DVD of this live album because the intensity is so there. These guys know how to give an awesome show back then and I think still put on a good live show even though Jesse died and Mick is gone. Danny could never live up to Mick's talents behind the set, but at least the band is still active. They formed way in the early 80's, 1981 I think. Their lyrical topics are taken from heavy political standpoints and society. They sing about things that I think people can really relate to. I don't agree with everything that they right about, but I still think that they really put a lot of thought and time into what they choose to write about.\n\nThis live video with them at their peak is played with utmost precision. I especially like the newer tracks like \"Malicious Intent\", \"If The Truth Be Known\" and \"Suffer The Children.\" That doesn't at all mean that I dislike their earlier stuff. It's actually played on here very well by Mitch and Jesse dishing out the grind riffs and a live production sound that's super high end quality. \"Barney\" is at his finest, he changed his vocal style on the newer outputs. I'd rather stick with the past work with him especially on 'Harmony Corruption' and 'Utopia Banished.' They should've stayed death/grind, but decided the path that they did and are still high end intensity on newer live shows.\n\nI think that they really lost their spirit nowadays with newer albums. Again the music here is just brutal with riffs that are blazingly fast. Mick played a role in getting them to play at their peak with their intensity. Simply amazing. His blast beating has become an interest and influence on newer death/grind bands like Nausea, et al. He really had that super intensity that was unequivocal. \"Barney\" is totally \"chuffed\" in terms of dishing out the death metal style of vocals. Amazing that the whole band came together and just annihilated the spectators. I wished that I could've seen them on 'Harmony Corruption' tour with Mick in the band. But he had left and never got to see him live unfortunately.\n\nThis whole output is simply extreme noise terror, even the founder of Earache records who knew the band when they had just formed in the early 80's would agree. I don't think that there are any songs on here that I don't like. Some are like 5 seconds long like \"Dead\" as an example. But yeah, these guys would probably be more likeable if they kept at the death/grind they were so good at. Some other good songs that were newer at the time were also admirable like \"Mindsnare\" and \"Extremity Retained.\" All songs were played with precision and each band member gave a little commentary on politics, musical interests (mellow to extreme) and overall it was an outstanding performance.\n",
        "\nIt pains me to say this but Napalm Death are long past needing to retire. I left Time Waits For No Slave behind soon after it was released, sensing a palpable diminishment in the band, mainly in Barney's failing voice and the unwarranted need for them to start fooling around with the lame experiments that degraded their discography back in the late '90's. That feeling is so much worse with this record. Utilitarian is hands-down the worst record Napalm Death has ever released and I cannot fathom the acclaim it has received in so many quarters. In the two years since it was released, I have tried and failed repeatedly to like this album, to give my favorite band a chance to show me they still have some fire left, but I can only shake my head at this tired, wrong-headed album.\n\nI remember when everyone shat their pants over Diatribes, a record that had many similar features to this one: clean guitar tones, clean singing, lots of mid-tempo grooves, and strange dissonant experimentation. That record cost ND half their audience (and all their street cred) in '96 and it wasn't until 2000's Enemy Of The Music Business that the band recovered their earlier straight-up death-grind sound. So when TWFNS came out, and some of those earlier stylistic mishaps started sneaking back into the ND sound, I was worried. Utilitarian confirmed my fears. \n\nThe biggest problem is Barney's vocals. Somewhere around 2006, Barney started losing his voice. The dry, airless barks on this record are a pale shade compared to his previously deep roars. I am surprised that few other reviewers have articulated how badly Barney's voice has deteriorated. It is almost impossible for me to listen to how shriveled he sounds. Put on any song from Utopia Banished and hear the diminishment of two decades. It is impossible for me to ignore -- something I wish I could do to his clean singing, its hilariously awful and always has been.\n\nThe music isn't much better. After so many decades of death-grind, coming up with fresh riffs has proven a challenge. These riffs are tired and gussying them up with some fancy window dressing ala clean open chords, dissonant noise, skronking sax solos, etc. is just a distraction. Like so many other great bands whose best days are behind them, Napalm Death are stuck in a pattern of releasing new music as an excuse to tour. The revitalizing energy of the early 00's has faded and the band has clearly run out of ideas. Utilitarian casts back over their entire discography, takes every single idea they've ever had and smashes it all together in a listless and pointless form of encapsulation: \"this is all Napalm Death has ever sounded like, altogether, on one record\" would be perfect promo copy, if they included a disclaimer about mediocre riffs and exhausted vocals. \n\nFor those of us decades in the trenches with Napalm Death, the band we used to love isn't coming back. All those who dig and praise this record can keep it but to really hear the heights these guys once stood on, track back to Harmony Corruption and go forward from there.\n",
        "\nAfter growing tired of death metal, Napalm Death released a series of lackluster experimental/groove albums before settling on a format of fast and blasting hc/death/grind augmented by \"weird chords\" with 2000's Enemy of the Music Business. After so many similar (and vapid) albums this past decade, the band thought it wise (or maybe it was the share holders at Century Media) to \"refresh\" themselves with an album that combines their \"2000's and beyond\" era with an experimental edge, only nothing has changed. Beyond the surface of adornments like clean sung vocals at select parts and a blaring saxophone (John Zorn guest appears), it is a repackaging of the same old crap. Napalm Death have become their very own worst enemy. Too stupid to quit long ago, they have cheapened their hardcore/punk roots and their death metal era yet again with Utilitarian - one more crappy album to add to their collection, but that's the state of this world.\n\nFor starters, it's really hard to grasp how anyone can relate to this dishonesty just from the performances on display here. Barney Greenway's vocals keep deteriorating like they have been since the release of 2000's Enemy of the Music Business. Gone is the powerful and forceful enraged grunt/shout/growl of old, and now we have the manic barking of a tired old man that occasionally lapses into drunken sounding monotone clean vocals at times in some songs (\"Fall on Their Swords\" is one example of this). Even Mitch Harris' backing shrieks take a back seat for some less deranged, hoarser shouts most of the time. Drums sound either mic'd improperly (cymbals sound flimsy) or over triggered/sampled. The bass and guitar tracks have a sharp sound, but no low end (maybe concessions that were made to compensate for the deteriorated vocals?). Where are the \"whirlwind hyper cans\" and \"sub-end vexation\"?\n\nAnother point of contention must be made with the lyrics, which have taken on an egalitarian \"first world/dreamworld\" problems angle that's a far cry from the lyrics of Scum (or even tracks like Armageddon x7). They have run out of topics to write about in regards to human beings relationships to this planet or our survival, instead focusing on niche topics like sexism and gender identity. This uninspired Napalm Death is without power or purpose, clearly running on empty. Disappointing, and while that was to be expected, I was taken aback over how far this once monolithic force of grinding musical power has fallen into the camp of flow chart derived, corporate approved sonic weakness.\n\nWith Utilitarian, Napalm Death have reached their low point. Music is loud but listless, like a lifeless alarm of sorts: a blaring sense of vacuity. Aside from the aforementioned adornments of saxophone and clean/effected vocals, as well as some pedal effected riffs, nothing has changed. Fusing their \"everything but the kitchen sink\" trend style of their mid-90's releases with the incessant blasting of their \"extreme\" 2000's and beyond era, but now incorporating these \"new\" ideas (that are actually old ideas that were already explored in the early 90's by former drummer Mick Harris' various projects as well as their own Diatribes album). Grotesque imitations. None of this is forward thinking, it's just a new surface Napalm Death could utilize to seem \"refreshing\" to the more unwise among their old audience while appearing \"fashionably different\" to a possible new audience of weak minds who are none the wiser.\n\nBlasting chaos without focus gives the impression of ranting old men and little else, as songs share a similar moment to moment display of the same tired pseudo-melodic blaring tremolo/chord phrases going into hardcore/punk phrases with 2-hit drumming to achieve their goal of \"being rowdy like death metal but being cool with the punks too\", but inserting annoying math rock derived noodling and Voivod inspired chords at times for the sake of being \"unconventional\" (\"Orders of Magnitude\" suffers from this throughout it's duration). They are typically arranged in a verse-chorus-extended bridge and back to verse-chorus format, but sometimes tracks blare off into an \"anthemic ending\" which recalls modern hardcore of the Terror variety but with \"strange chords\". It's obnoxious and feels like they were randomly combining ideas they couldn't use in their side projects and hastily fitting them into blast laden numbers to fulfill their contractual obligation towards making another album. The only variety that occurs can be found in tracks like \"Circumspect\" or \"The Wolf I Feed\", but only because they feel like one idea being taken to it's conclusion instead of 8 being randomly thrown around over fast drums for the sake of being \"extremely unorthodox\" (even then, they're not good).\n\nForget that old-school logo on the cover because there's nothing to gain here. Their extremity was not retained. Napalm Death have fallen in line with the interests of Century Media's focus groups, investors, and board of directors. Dressing up the past hoping we fund their master plan of rehashing the same ideas in more vapid side projects (a real Greed Killing if there ever was one). I always saw Napalm Death from the early 90's and before as some kind of infallible musical force to be reckoned with, but is it right to tolerate this focus group created process of seemingly haphazardly cobbled together travesties? No.\n\nIf anyone can offer this throwaway Napalm Death any advice, it would be to stop making music under the Napalm Death moniker since it is quite clearly a brand now with all it's integrity scooped out. This 2000's and beyond incarnation seem to have a knack for creating Swans inspired dirges such as \"Morale\" and \"Omnipresent Knife in your Back\". Barney Greenway's (and the rest of the band for that matter) performances on these songs feel inspired and not like one of a tired man bogged down by the obligation to seem \"angry\" over trite faux-death/grind like the vapidity which can be heard on this album. With what's on display here there's seemingly nothing to halt this tide.\n\nWhen the final track \"A Gag Reflex\" ended with it's obnoxious tough guy 90's Chaos AD groove riff, there was no change in mental state; I was just left wondering \"what the hell were they trying to achieve with this crap?\". The cover art is different, there's a saxophone in there, but it might as well be a reissue of their last album (which was already terrible and suffered from the same problems). The promo pic which shows the band making a parody of Wall Street reflects how cynical and corporate minded this band has become. Avoid this rancid display of musical feces. Vapid.\n",
        "\nWhat we have here is a combination of death metal like vocals done by Napalm Death's old singer, Lee Dorrian and backup ones by Mick Harris, who left the band in the early 90's. I'd have to say that the older Napalm Death releases like this one are where they were at their best. I would say that this album is better than \"Scum\" because the music is more catchy and the intensity of the songs are more noticable. They have all kinds of tempo changes like a slow intro and a slow outro.\n\nThe band did justice here for grindcore, them being pretty much the originators of the extreme music. \"From Enslavement To Obliteration\" is an album that one can get into easily because the musical quality and production were way better than average for a grindcore act (old Napalm Death I mean). When \"Harmony Corruption\" came out with Mark \"Barney\" Greenway, I think that all of the songs and production were superb as well. They didn't give up their roots on that one, but later play more death metal more than grind.\n\nThe compositions here by Bill Steer on guitars is filled with all sorts of original ideas based on his influences and not duplicating anything, just playing his bar chord exhibitions and shying away from any sort of lead guitars, which is different than when he was and now is again with Carcass. I think that he puts forth some sounds done like no other and intensity through the whole album except for the intro and outro guitars. He doesn't contribute anything to the vocals, Lee and Mick were on duty for that.\n\nI'd say that this is like death metal mixed with grindcore. You can hear what Bill's playing even with the extreme blast beating. Some of the riffs are going at full speed and it's really intense to say the least. I'd really say that Mick was the best drummer for the band, I suppose that he left because he sort of lost interest with extreme music. He was one hell of a grindcore drummer. I don't think that the drummer that replaced him (Danny) comes close to Mick's talent.\n\nSo hearing this album compared to the newer Napalm Death sound, they don't have really brutal vocals anymore, Lee was pure deep throat and \"Barney\" was better in the early 90's via \"Harmony Corruption\" and \"Utopia Banished.\" Well, the music here is what counts the most and you can because of the production hear Bill Steer's riff outputs even when Mick is grinding out blast beats. Most songs are not extremely long, but longer than the ones from \"The Peel Sessions\" compilation.\n\nLee and Mick kept the band brutal and insanely intense on this album. Bill had some leads here and some songs were very brief. The bulk of the grind was in the guitar, drums and vocals. The combination of the low-end grunts by Lee and the high pitch sounds done by Mick gave the band more variety. Bill does an awesome job on the guitar, even though maybe there were only 1-2 leads on this entire album. His riffs are immensely good, maybe even better than that.\n\nFor a grindcore band during the earlier days, this album sure puts a good impact on the music community because it simply uncompromising. The lyrical concepts are well thought out too and I think that as a whole, the band made an outstanding contribution to grindcore in itself. There's nothing compared to the older sound of the band, nowadays I find their albums to be monotonous and that they disbanded from their roots. Shane has been in the band for the longest time still dishing out great bass guitar.\n\nIf you're looking for grindcore at its absolute finest, \"From Enslavement To Obliteration\" is where it's at. You can find the full album on YouTube. It would be good to own even just the actual CD of this one because it's to me one of their best releases. With Bill out of the band and back to playing guitars with Carcass, Mitch Harris is a good fill. It's tragic what happened to Jesse Pintado, dead at 37. Anyway, for grind and extreme music lovers, this one should definitely hit home and 34+ minutes of intensity!\n",
        "\nA 20+ minute bout of sheer NOISE. This CD is grindcore at it's finest! Low end vocals by Lee Dorrian and high end screams by Mick Harris. Heavy wrenching guitar work by Bill Steer and on bass the immortal Shane Embury who's been with the band the longest. What we have hear is almost musically unspeakable. So intense and BRUTAL! The guitars are all over the place, mostly fast tremolo picked riffs and heavy duty bar chords with blasting by the amazing drums.\n\nSome songs are 6 seconds and I'd say a majority out of the whole CD there are no songs lasting more than 2 minutes. In fact, most songs are about 1 minute and a half tops. Just grind city and a raw production quality. This is Napalm Death at their most brutal and intense. There simply is no letting up with the deep throat vocals fluctuated with Mick Harris' screaming! His drums almost never let up in intensity and the compilation has a little reverb added to that drum set.\n\nThere aren't many songs on here that you can really make out what's being played because what you mostly hear are not only the guitar, but bass riffs that have a distorted sound to them. The band plays some covers on here. You CANNOT say that this is really music, it's really just a conglomeration of distorted guitar work and because the snare is blasting away constantly, it's hard to hear the music itself. There are only a few seconds of lead guitar work, pretty much all of this is pure grind.\n\nThis is one of the most intense 20+ minutes of sheer abomination! I have never heard a most extreme noise terror outlet by this band, it's simply amazing in intensity and total musical destruction. Yes the guitars are loud enough on here, but when you hear the drum blasting, I can't really make out and actual music. When the tempos are slower, then you can definitely make out what's being played. I think that Napalm Death did something here that is quite amazing if you want an adrenaline rush.\n\nThere are 25 songs on here most of which you can find the lyrics of, but from a musical standpoint, this is what grindcore should sound like and definitely should be at its most intense. These guys put in so much energy in each track, even if one was 6 seconds long like the song \"Dead.\" There's only maybe 1-2 tracks that are slower. The bulk of the release is just a good caffeine boost to have in the morning to get you going. This compilation is one of N/D's most notorious ones in just 20 minutes. It's hard to believe they were able to make this really work. If you want extreme noise terror, The Peel Sessions is for you!\n",
        "\nThis album has already gotten reviewed by \"millions\" of metal enthusiasts worldwide, but I still feel like I should give my two-cents. Grindcore has always been a hit and miss for me, and although the hype around this album still survives to this very day, more than twenty years after its release, for me, it sounds like total crap. \n\nGranted, the lyrics behind this album possess some real depth, being one of the harshest anti-capitalist critiques in all of music. But does the music possess the same depth, the lyrics so amazingly own? No way. The music is as bland as it can get, it's very simplistic, harsh, and straight to the point. If not provided with some booklet from where to read the lyrics, the feat behind them, becomes insignificant because you can't understand squat, because everything just sounds like a big cluster-fuck, with no real sense of direction. \n\nThis album contains the shortest song ever produced, entitled \"You suffer\" which is basically a one second piece of total crap. I mean, what's the purpose of holding a Guinness world record, when the \"song\" can't even be enjoyed? If a couple of drum beats, backed by a wall of sound of crappy guitar \"melody\" can qualify as music, then music's meaning has to be redefined. \n\nEach song on this album is too short to have any real meaning. The listener of this album is surrounded by a huge wall which deprives him from really enjoying the entire album, and make out something of it. A very strange oxymoron if you ask me. The artwork on this one, is very appealing to be completely honest. It perfectly represents the postmodern condition, showing some greedy politicians, above a huge pile of skulls, which symbolize the entire human race. One can really be fooled into expecting some grandeur in this album, if one's opinion is solely based on the artwork. \n\nThe copious amount of songs on this album, furthermore enhance its void. Napalm Death's approach towards music can be defined as \"quantitative rather than qualitative\", sure quantitative does not necessarily mean terrible, but in this case, the bold character that mediocrity possesses is just enormous. The entire musical structure, is quite simplistic, but unfortunately to the inexperienced ear, such void can hide behind a cryptic, complex veil, which is not the case. The number of songs on this album, is definitely one of my main gripes with this album, apart from the number of songs, for it completely destroys any chance the listener has, to enjoy each song individually. \n\nBy the end of this album, I was left asking myself the question of why I even bothered giving this album a listen. Probably, it was because of all the hype surrounding this terrible mediocrity. Basically, all I can say is that this album does nothing in conveying some sort of musical experience, although it does send a valuable message to the entire masses out there, to wake up from their dream. The production is passable, or at least, much better than your average grindcore album. I don't really see the reason why this album is considered as a cult in this sub-genre, I guess fortune played an important role.\n",
        "\nBirmingham\u2019s Napalm Death have been one of the most important bands in extreme music for over a quarter of a century now, having released 13 full length albums starting with 1987\u2032s Scum, one of the first grindcore albums ever recorded.\n\nDue to the fact they\u2019ve been so prolific, and that some of their albums in the late 90\u2032s/early 2000\u2032s weren\u2019t quite so good as their earlier material, some of their albums tend to get a little forgotten about and ignored. Which is a shame, because 2006\u2032s Smear Campaign was one of the best grindcore albums of the 2000s.\n\nBeginning with a slow, almost industrial piece, the album then kicks into a ripping punishing deathgrind album.\nBarney\u2019s trademark bark is at its veciferous best throughout the album, spitting vitriol and venom, especially on the mighty \u201cfreedom is the wage of sin\u201d. Riff after riff is delivered by mitch harris, from fast and grinding to slow and crushing, to ones which groove, its simplya fantastic riff fest of an album. Drummer Danny Herrera also puts in a great performance, energetic and heavy, while the bass grinds along courtesy of Shane Embury. The album also sees a guest performance with Anneke Van Giersbergen (ex-the gathering, solo) providing spoken word vocals on \u201cIn Deference\u201d, giving a darker atmosphere to the song.\n\nOverall its an extremely underrated album by Napalm Death, constituting their best release of the century so far. Highlights include Freedom is the wage of sin, In Deference, and Fatalist, but in truth its fantastic throughout. Any fans of the band, or fans of death metal and grindcore in general should listen to it ASAP if managed to slip under the radar.\n\nOriginally written for swirlsofnoise.com\n",
        "\nScum is an enjoyable, groundbreaking, and revolutionary album in the world of extreme metal. One must be familiar with this album in order to fully understand genres such as Grindcore and Death Metal. Along with the fantastic song writing, the primitive, rough, dirty, fast, and absolutely inaccessible sound of Scum is the original blueprint for Grindcore and Death Metal. \n\nLet\u2019s begin with a brief history overview. In the mid 80\u2019s there were a few active movements pertaining to extreme music. Bands such as Slayer and Venom were already taking metal into a fast and ferocious direction. Simultaneously, deeply underground subcultures such as Crust Punk were creating a sound that conveyed a totally raw, dark, filthy, and angry mindset. The point of Amebix and similar bands was to express an utter disgust with mankind as a whole. This is the environment that bands like Napalm Death and Repulsion were brought up in. The scene was like a time bomb ready to explode, and Scum was the explosion.\n\nScum is a highly original album in regards to the time in which it was released. It contained a new songwriting formula. The riffs are thrashy, but too fast, dark, and mucky to be labeled \u201cThrash Metal.\u201d The ultra-bass heavy distortion settings along with the distorted bass add to the grossness of these riffs. The vocals are an intense complement to the music. Lee Dorrian\u2019s vocals are just as bass heavy and filthy as the instrumentation. Over the years, Death Metal vocals have been adjusted and refined in sickening ways, but at the time the vocals on this album were the heaviest thing in extreme metal. They provided the groundwork for the evolution of the low and guttural Death Metal vocals that we all know and love. The lyrics on this album are deep, hateful, and rebellious analogies of society and the human race. That being said, they are relatively incomprehensible and are recited as fast as the actual music. This is another technique that has been perfected in later Grind/Death albums. A profoundly significant component of Scum is the drums. Mick Harris is the father of the blast beat. Blast beats have been around since the early 80\u2019s (check out the band Asocial for instance), but this is the album that demonstrated just how fast they can potentially be played. Along with the ultra-fast crusty thrash beats that make room for head banging grooves, the messy drums in each song always lead into a blast beat section that redefines the word \u201cspeed.\u201d The songs are so fast that they can\u2019t possibly be any longer than 2 minutes. Scum is where it all started. \n\nLegacy and impact aside, the songs on Scum are actually good. This album consists of two distinctly different halves. The songs on the first half are good metal songs. They are a nice blend of Grindcore, Hardcore Punk, Old School Death Metal, and Sludge. They are all individually catchy, easily moshable, and fun to play on any instrument. Instinct of Survival, for example, is musically and lyrically one of my favorite songs of all time. It is, therefore, understandable why countless numbers of Grindcore and Death Metal bands have covered these songs over the years. The second half of Scum is an entirely different creature. It consists of pure, 100% Grindcore songs. There are no grooves; these songs are all 30 second long collections of blast beats. This is Grindcore in its unadulterated form: absolutely raw filth. The second half of Scum is not as catchy as the first half, but it is still a good listen. Any Grindcore fan should find the songs intriguing. \n\nAs evident in the other reviews, Scum is a commonly disliked album. Some people have even gone as far as to label it \u201cthe worst album of all time.\u201d I firmly believe that the reason Scum is so hated is because it is too primitive for most people to handle. Think about it. As metal continues to evolve, bands figure out ways to perfect the sound of previous bands. As a result, over the years, the vocals become more distorted, the music becomes heavier and more technical, the subject matter becomes more morbid, etc. Not to mention, as the formula continues to perfect, the overall quality becomes cleaner \u2013 yet still dirty sounding \u2013 because people now have greater knowledge of how to effectively record such extreme music. Napalm Death, however, did not have a previous band to build off of. The music on Scum was a completely new sound at the time, so of course it does not meet today\u2019s standards. Furthermore, Napalm Death initially came from the Crust Punk scene. Horrible recording quality is a significant component of Crust Punk because it is a fundamental element of DIY ethics. This is partially a reason why Grindcore and Death Metal are, by nature, such inaccessible genres. The fact that actual fans of these genres hate Scum because of its inaccessibility exemplifies how extreme of an album it is. \n\nOne who dislikes the second half of Scum probably dislikes Grindcore in general. That\u2019s understandable because Grindcore is not for everyone. Any fan of Death Metal, however, should at least respect the first half of the album. It is an important piece of Extreme Metal history. As I previously stated, one must be familiar with this album in order to fully understand Grindcore and Death Metal. Respect your roots.\n",
        "\nA new singer. A new decade. A new direction. I jumped on board here, barreling with Napalm Death into the deepest uncharted waters of death metal. Did a lot of crust punks jump ship? You bet. Fuck 'em! Napalm's greatest mistakes were yet to come but wading neck-deep into the turbulent waters of Floridian death metal wasn't one of them.\n\nOne of the song titles on here is \"Extremity Retained\" and it is enormously fitting. Napalm Death had always been about extremes: extreme speed, extreme anger, extreme line-up instability. And I can think of nothing more extreme than slamming on the breaks and taking grind directly into mid-tempo death metal. And while the Brummies went straight Florida on Harmony Corruption, the signature sound of their earlier records isn't entirely absent either.\n\nNew vocalist Barney Greenway (ex. Benediction) makes his presence felt immediately on \"Vision Quest,\" which opens in a squeel of feedback and blurring riffs before Barney lets out one of his trademark roars: a personal stamp, a mission statement. His vocals are much deeper and rougher than his forebears. The production is a Scott Burns special with all the needles in the red. The guitars are distorted to the max, reduced to near white noise, the bass is evident in a rumbling undercurrent, and the drums are hot and boxy. \n\nThe album is a manifesto of sorts in the songwriting. Everything that Napalm Death would try on and discard in the next decade is present here: hyper-spastic grind bombast, bruising hardcore grooves, pummeling mid-tempo death metal, even some industrial/noise elements pop up in the sound. The best examples are the classics from this album: \"Suffer The Children,\" \"The Chains That Bind Us,\" \"Unfit Earth.\" These tracks utterly encapsulate what Napalm Death is all about. They are delivered with a fury and abandon that would later ebb away (only to be reinvigorated in early 00's when other bands who loved this record upped its ante). \n\nWhile Napalm Death have many great albums in their long discography, including some I overall enjoy more, this is the template. If you can't dig Harmony Corruption than most of Napalm Death's offerings aren't for you.\n",
        "\nFollow-up from the supremely monumental \"Harmony Corruption\" release, Napalm Death seemed to have a more polished production sound quality to this one, but fell a little bit short in the musical department. Since we're talking death metal/grindcore here, I'd say that this album was mostly a death metal type of release with grindcore mixed in with the music and the riffs were not as noteworthy as their predecessor. The music didn't stick as well, a combination of bar chord licks mixed in with heavily tremolo picking as they're so well known for, but this one kind of dragged on with nothing really flying in at a \"utopian base.\"\n\nWith Mick no longer behind the set, Danny's 1st full-length attempt to match Mick fell somewhat short on the set. The music was to me B- material, nothing that Mitch and Jesse (RIP) could really come up with that really baffled me. Barney's vocal outputs also were a bit different, a sort of echo to his burley vox, they weren't as deep. That's why I don't like much of the more recent material since he doesn't have that same burley sound as he did on his debut. The nickname Barney doesn't fit to him anymore because of this reason and I think Napalm Death fans would have a similar opinion of his sound is especially in the more modern releases.\n\nThere were just a few leads, but well composed, however they've never really emphasized them mostly just rhythms. I think it's better that they don't since the grind is enough tremolo picking in itself you don't want to have the music muddled out with blast beats, tremolo pick, leads and vocals all at once. You do get some of this here, so it sounds more like just noise. If I really wanted true noise, I'd revert back to \"Peel Sessions.\" In any case, the album had a big emphasis on lyrics, their anger and rage is brought on by the hatred regarding politics as well as other views, so yes, the aggression stood forth strongly and managed to be a decent listen to.\n\nI would have to say that the music was the highest emphasis on the release and some of the riffs were really catchy. The production wasn't flanked with much reverb as it's previous and I think that it seemed to have a fresher sort of composition as opposed to a sort of \"fuzzy\" type of tracks. In that sense, this album is strong, though the last track should've been omitted. It didn't really suit the intro, kind of like it should have been. I'd say that it did fall short in that aspect, but there is so much good to say about the album despite its imperfections. I sort of lost interest in the newer material not only because Jesse and Mick aren't in the band anymore plus Barney is not sounding like himself anymore.\n\nDespite what I threw out there as a follow up from the classic \"Harmony Corruption\", this one is good, but not nearly as good as that one. Just YouTube both albums and compare, you'll see that I'm not wrong in saying that \"Harmony Corruption\" way surpasses this one by a bunch. I sort of got the vibe that they went downhill from here and the earlier grind days with Mick in the band are a thing of a distant past. A tragedy to lose Jesse forever on 2nd guitar and that Mick going his own way and done with the band completely after \"Harmony Corruption.\" So listen to both and I don't think I'm wrong in saying yes this one is good, but nothing outranks it's predecessor.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death's Smear Campaign is aggressive, furious, modern and pounding death metal/grindcore. These guys have clearly stumbled upon a working formula here in the 21st century, with albums like Enemy of the Music Business, Smear Campaign, and Utilitarian all being quality works from the veteran grinders. I find Smear Campaign to slightly edge out those 2 albums, for example, not because of any difference in musical formula on this release, but because most of my Napalm modern favorites come from this release. \"Sink Fast, Let Go\", \"Puritanical Punishment Beating\", \"When All Is Said and Done\", \"Identity Crisis\", \"Rabid Wolves (for Christ)\", \"Deaf and Dumbstruck (Intelligent Design)\", \"Persona Non Grata\"... see, that's almost half of the album right there. (When I saw them live last December, I was bummed out that they didn't play a single song from this album! They could have made their set this whole album in order!) However, there isn't a single song on here that I would rate individually below an 8/10.\n\nMusically, nothing on this album is virtuoso in construction or execution. No technical guitar work, no difficult vocal lines, and no complicated drumming. But all 4 guys playing on these songs know their abilities and what they are best at, and go just for that. Mitch plays some fast grind riffs, some standard death metal riffs, and some mid-paced Celtic Frost-ish chugging that's just as catchy as it is on a Frost song like \"Morbid Tales\". Mitch also throws his high-pitched screams into many of the songs, a nice complement and opposite to Barney's vocals. Shane's bass isn't very audible most of the time, but when it gets standout parts, the tone is highly distorted and the playing is fast and aggressive. Danny divides his drum parts between fast blasting, some double bass, and d-beats/thrash beats. No obvious under-usage or over-usage of any of these styles, and thus the drumming on the album remains \"simple\" but perfectly fitting and creative. There's not even a single song here that exclusively features one drumming style, so there is no chance of calling the drumming \"repetitive\". And Barney's vocals are brutal and intense, espousing total confidence in the material that he is singing. To speak of the lyrics, this album is a \"concept album\" with just about every song having religious criticism within. It's obvious that Barney and Shane (the lyric writers, who split it about 50/50) are convinced that religion is a detriment to the progression of society (a view I agree with), and the lyrics are smart, thought-provoking, and worth reading in the booklet. They almost make you wish the album was sung with clean vocals so they could always be understandable, but in the end you decide not to wish this because you realize you'd miss Barney's and Mitch's grind shouts and screams too much.\n\nThe production on Smear Campaign is appropriately modern and loud and clear, but not over-produced or annoying on any fronts. Sometimes Danny's blast sections lose a little bit of audio quality, and Barney's vocals sometimes have noticeable effects on them, but neither of these things take away any noticeable enjoyment from the album.\n\nAt 45 minutes, and with songs averaging around 3 minutes in length, there is plenty of material to ingest, and the songs receive the appropriate amount of development, enough to be more enjoyable then sub-minute grind blasts, but never to the point that they start to drag. The songs never contain too many riffs, preferring instead to work with 3-5 awesome riffs, and the songs are always better for this. Riff quantity does not supplant the quality or memorability.\n\nSmear Campaign is a great release from Napalm, that is very memorable and that will draw you back again and again. \"Sink Fast, Let Go\" is a great opener that starts with Mitch's screams, \"When All Is Said and Done\" is an almost pro-humanist death/grind \"anthem\" that is clearly designed to be the catchiest song on the album, \"Rabid Wolves (for Christ)\" is an obvious throwback to the late 80's Napalm sound, \"Deaf and Dumbstruck (Intelligent Design)\" contains the greatest chorus combo of vocals, riffage, and blasting on the entire album, and all of the other songs are awesome too, even the slow, \"experimental\" title track/closer.\n\nAbsolutely worth purchase.\n",
        "\nFear, Emptiness, Despair in 1994 was noted by fans of Napalm Death as the band's full transition into their '90s sound template, a death/groove metal style which divided the fan base and gained some derision among metal heads for ND changing their sound and style. While many love to bash this album and blame it for their less noteworthy releases later in the 1990s, truth be told, it's not all that bad to listen to. \n\nFear, Emptiness, Despair has some of Napalm Death's most skilled guitar work and progressive songwriting out of all of their '90s material. It organized the chaotic grinding of their earlier albums into a newer, sleeker, more punishing package. As a stand alone album, it's really pretty sweet.\n\nThe album opens on a high, fast note with the rampaging song Twist The Knife (Slowly). After a few seconds of guitar build up, Barney kicks off the album with a savage roar, leading into guitar grooves that hit you with the force of a 10-story building collapsing. Barney's roaring helps the guitar along to create an atmosphere of uncontrolled chaos from which there is no escape. The lines \"Unborn suffer, unborn suffer, unborn suffer the norm\" only add to this destructive Molotov cocktail of a song. All in all, it is a damn satisfying song.\n\nHung starts off with a sliding two-note groove that is jarring and rousing at first. This riff, though, gets old after about a minute into the song. Feeling bored, I skipped the song about halfway through, but boy did I miss something at about the 2:45 mark in the song as it finally shows a bit of progression and goes into one of the gnarliest breakdowns ever conceived ten seconds later. This breakdown was enough to save me from completely disowning this song, but it doesn't save it from being skipped halfway most times I hear it. Needless to say, I have mixed feelings about this one.\n\nRemain Nameless has more variation and compelling riffs and grooves that improve upon Hung's mistakes while keeping a similar formula. It has breaks and changes in the song that aren't as numerous on Hung and keeps the song interesting. It also has a neat breakdown at the end of the song, but if you think this is going to be an album of pointless, simple breakdowns, you are sorely mistaken. The breakdowns on these two songs are nice, smooth, and complex as opposed to deathcore-ish chugging. Also, these songs are the only ones on the album that follow a formula similar to one another. Remain Nameless is a good song, way better than Hung.\n\nPlague Rages is seen as the big player on this album and it's the song that got featured in a music video and even a Beavis and Butthead skit. It has its own single as well, so that signifies some significance, but let's actually talk about the song for a minute.\n\nPlague Rages has a tasty, twisting intro groove and is driven by the riffs alternating with Barney's vocals setting the angry stage for the song and building a chorus and lines at the end. Around the end of the song, the blast beats kick in and Barney is screaming \"A PLAGUE RAGES!\" at the top of his lungs, leading to a crashing conclusion of blast beats, slamming guitar grooves, and Barney's angered growling. This song is more than satisfying and is a savage, great listen.\n\nMore Than Meets The Eye is simpler than all the others before it, but works due to the fact that the song has rousing riffs and grooves and a chorus line that acts as a memorable rallying point. The song starts to show welcome signs of lingering grindcore influence around the middle before going back to the original riff towards the end of the song. Simple, but rousing and enjoyable.\n\nThe next three songs, Primed Time, State of Mind, and Armageddon X 7, all contrast and are similar to the first five songs, the similarity being the style of music played and the difference being that these songs are forgettable and generic groove metal that do little to draw you in or interest you. These songs are the ones I would not recommend listening to as you will not be impressed by their simplicity and how generic they are.\n\nRetching on the Dirt and Fasting on Deception have more tasteful riffs and start to make things interesting once again. The intro to Fasting on Deception also has the second best intro on the album (the first being the intro to Twist the Knife). The riffage on both of these songs is also more complex and rhythmic than the last three songs, meaning they actually are engaging. These two songs are better than the last three and should keep most people engaged.\n\nThrowaway shows elements of vestigial grindcore holding on from the band's early days and serves as a perfectly gloomy outro track. The blast beats and swirling tremolos create an atmosphere of grim depression and fear. Barney's vocals only add to the sense of bleak, delicious hopelessness that this song projects. This song creates the kind of desperation and gloom that many newbie black metallers try to create, but fail to do so. Recommended listen since this song is so jarring and depressive that it's awesome.\n\nOverall, Fear, Emptiness, Despair is a good album with a few faults. Had something been done to spruce up or make songs 6 through 8 more interesting than this, album would've scored somewhere in the mid-90% range. Even so, Plague Rages, Twist the Knife (Slowly), and Throwaway are stellar tracks accompanied by many good ones (Hung, Remain Nameless, More than Meets the Eye, Retching on the Dirt, and Fasting on Deception). This album is a good listen and overall I enjoyed it and still see it as one of Napalm Death's better albums. It was worth the money I paid for it.\n",
        "\nThe split albums will always be a constant (And ritualistic tradition) within the DIY bands and the ones who once belonged to it. this case is not the exception, we got the powerful ones who put the \"-core\" suffix in metalcore, on the other hand we got the creators of one of the most brutal genres ever been created: grindcore.\n\nThe clash of two generations will always be a succes, different sounds joined in this old tradition, sure to think that this kind of rituals make everything possible, even combine two legends in their respectives genres in one place, also serving to introduce the old ones to the new things that are going now, and viceversa.\n\nConverge side is a direct slap in the face, with the chaotic sounds and fury that make them one of the top bands within the community, the cacophony and chaos that melt in order thanks to the mathematic speed and precision in every note that they play, following the rule to do this in no more than a minute and keep smashing the chords, beating the drums and screaming like no tomorrow to come, all of this things are packed in the first track \"No Ligh Escapes\".\n\n\"Wolverine Blues\" is the cover that people needed, with collaborations of Aaron Turner and legends of melodeath scene like Tomas Lindberg. Revitalizing a theme from the old time Death 'N' Roll to the new sound, but keeping the essence of the original one, Converge does a good effort to pay tribute to the long lived and mythical band from Sweden: Entombed.\n\nNapalm Death's side is traditional Grindcore at his best, with the first track \"Will By Mouth\" they only remark us what we know since the beggining: Their mastership on the chaotic chords, the brutallity of the constant beat of the drums and the growls of an old spirit with such greatness that even at his age is at his best, making us think that time will come and he'll be no longer growl in that manner and he's giving everything to trascend in every aspect, and he has done it since \"Harmony Corruption\"\n\n\"No Impediment to Triumph (Bhopal)\" The closing track of this split marks a difference with the previos one: this track is more accesible, keeping the brutallity and their characteristic rage, giving some moments of relaxation and even a sticky riff, making us think that the band never undid their punkish past and remembering us were do they came, which is their past, a past that will always be with them even if we don't see it clear: Their DIY constant.\n",
        "\nThis was the point where Napalm Death left the template of their legendary blast beat and punk fuelled grind and injected a smidgen of metal into the equation. It would be another year until they fully embraced metal but Mentally Murdered was the turning point for the band. They were testing the waters so to speak and for an experiment I have to admit it was a rather successful accomplishment. Rather than a full length album the band delivered this in the form of a six song EP (although I consider it a mini-LP). Gone were the 20 second speedy crust workouts and in their place were massive riffs. Check out the guitar work on opener Rise Above for further evidence of this. Yet it only takes a minute for the band to return to their old ways. As soon as vocalist Lee Dorrain lets out a guttural belch it\u2019s back to work as normal then just when you\u2019d expect the song to end along comes a half time break down. For Napalm Death to have this much going on in a track was at the time something of a revelation.\n\nCause And Effect could have been taken straight from debut album Scum, although half the speed of that albums glut of noise it\u2019s the most standard Napalm Death fare. It\u2019s Walls Of Confinement though that has to be my favourite track though. It has every element I love about the band. At around one minute and twenty seconds there is a huge breakdown part which is followed by (heaven forbid) a guitar solo which is beyond great. It\u2019s such a simple thing and nowadays a grind fan would not blink an eye but back in 1989 the band were re-writing the rule book.\n\nBefore I bought the mini-LP I had read a few reviews so I sort of knew what to expect but I didn\u2019t expect to like it as much as I did. A lot of the original fans of the band left them at this point and it\u2019s easy to see why. There was very little clue what would come next after the band released their sophomore record From Enslavement To Obliteration for the band to embrace heavy metal as much as they did here must have come as quite the shock. A year later Harmony Corruption was released and the band had embraced metal fully. The grindcore tag still follows the band today but there is no mistaking that Mentally Murdered was the point where the band grew tired of being tied to the sound.\n",
        "\nFear, Emptiness, Despair is a polarizing record. That needs to be out front because many metal heads won't even give it the time of day. They blame this album for ND falling off a cliff in the mid-to-late 90's, which is entirely unfair. This is Napalm Death at their heaviest and most straight-forward yet the material here is far from accessible. Whereas later ND albums went all simplistic and easy, this record cuts deep with a suffocating air of pervasive horror and gloom. This is Harmony Corruption taken to further extremes, a moment where Napalm Death decided to once again accentuate the death side of their death-grind equation.\n\nHeavily informed by Meathook Seed (Mitch Harris's industrial death side-project with members of Obituary), Fear, Emptiness, Despair rolls at a medium tempo relying more on nuanced riffs and menacing grooves than hyper-grind and unremitting blasts. As such it alienated many, especially coming off the feeding frenzy that was Utopia Banished. But this step back was vital for the majority of Utopia Banished's grind vortex blurred indistinguishably whereas F.E.D. has well-defined songwriting that sacrifices none of N.D.'s power and menace. Take first single \"Plague Rages,\" it builds slowly with an ominous riff moving at snail's pace before a slow acceleration incrementally builds towards the blast beat/double-bass inferno that dominates the conclusion. Or the opening rage-induced attack of \"Twist The Knife (Slowly),\" a song that recalls Obituary at their most compact and aggressive. This track made it onto some soundtracks due to some blatant cross-promotion on Earache/Columbia's part but no one I know enjoyed it. They were terrified, and rightly so. Had I not already been into death metal, I would've run too. Barney sounds like an uncaged beast shot full of methamphetamine. His voice heaving and ragged and just plain venomous. \n\nOne of the best tracks here is \"Hung.\" The sliding riff and bass run as Barney bellows and the drums nail this tight syncopated beat is killer. This track slams you over and over with its thick grooves before becoming completely unhinged with blinding riffs and scintillating d-beats and blasts -- this is a smart approach, layering that old-school N.D. feel into a newer template of mid-tempo death. When the blasts let up, they curb stomp you with a huge darkened groove that feels like a wall caving in. An unqualified success, \"Hung\" is one of Napalm Death's best songs. Another is \"Throwaway,\" the fastest and most old-school song on here. It blisters with ridiculous blasts and is a real showcase for Danny Herrera's tight drum work. Then Mitch and Jesse trade this twisted riff work over some jaunty double-bass. Shane's keeps things heavy with strong bass runs while Barney rages maniacally throughout. Ill stuff indeed and a slap in the face of anyone who calls this album weak.\n\nApparently Colin Richardson's production was a salvage job from Pete Coleman's initial work but I actually think that turns in the band's favor. There is a rich tension in the production. The guitars are thick and grey-toned with heavy slabs of distortion layered over them. Shane's bass is fuzzy and active beyond the riffs. His playing really stands out for a change. And Danny Herrera's drums are front and center with a rich snappy sound. All the instruments have a sinister vibe, as if slathered in a post-apocalyptic industrial grime. Barney's voice too sounds different: strained and sinister, deeper than ever. Apparently recording conditions caused his throat to close forcing him to force extra air through his diaphragm. Whatever the problem, it worked in his favor.\n\nIf you are looking for darkly atmospheric death metal with ominous industrial overtones, you could do a whole lot worse than Fear, Emptiness, Despair -- a deeply misunderstood record that has more than stood the test of time. It may linger at a slight remove from the majority of N.D.'s discography in terms of punishing speed and grind aesthetics and it may have presaged their mid-to-late 90's decline but don't hold that against one of the most powerful and singular records in the N.D. canon.\n",
        "\nLet me clear something up first. I love Napalm Death so this rant and negative review doesn't reflect hate on the band in general. Quite the opposite really because to me they're one of the best bands I've ever listened to in the grindcore genre along with Carcass. \n\nSo why am I hating on this album? Well simply put, this album is so distinct from their later stuff, and I honestly can't stand the overall presentation of this record. \n\nTo top things off, the production is terrible and is a mess all around. All I can hear is just pure noise coming from every single member in the band at the time. Random Drum beats, and blast beats that don't even flow through any of the songs not to mention the guitars are distorted as hell that I can't even tell if its the riffs from the guitars, or just a random static fuzzy noise going on. This is hell for me I can't stress that enough and not one of those fun hell rides you get from listening to such an awesome album; no, this is one of those hell rides that just pains your ears to death wondering what the fuck you were listening to in the first place. Not even Carcass's first album sounded like this abomination and it was grindcore with people who managed to have a composition and overall flow. Unlike this one. \n\nThe one thing that killed this mainly was the vocals. Oh my god of all the worst vocals I've heard in bands this has got to be the worst. Lee Dorian either was too lazy to practice the vocals prior to the release, or he was just a natural born vocalist that doesn't have the feel or ability to do good behind a damn mic. I get a headache listening to his vocals. I'd rather listen to this whole album without the vocals and hell, I'd rather have Barney do vocals on this album as it would've sounded much better.\n\nI respect the contribution this album has had on the grindcore scene, but this was a listening hell ride experience that I never want go back to as it just a random guys at the time sounding like they recorded this whole mediocre attempt in a garage rather then a studio. There's nothing else that needs to be said about this album as it outweights all the pros. Hell, if there is even any pros for that matter, and the reason this gets 12 is because its Napalm Death, and some credit or score has to be given because this is such an influential album that I'd feel bad giving this a zero.\n",
        "\nI think that Napalm Death are easily one of the most underrated bands when it comes to \"creativity\". It may be a simple reflection of the fact that the band's so-called \"experimental\" era (which lasted throughout the latter half of the 90's) is generally overlooked by fans (and the band itself, it would seem) due to it's lessened emphasis on blast beats and grindcore-oriented riffing, or the common misconception that these albums were, pure and simple, \"Fear Factory worship\" (how ridiculous!). However, whatever the case may be, anyone who holds that opinion likely isn't familiar with this album in particular.\n\nOf the four albums released in this era, this is easily the one granted the least recognition. You might hear an intoxicated bald guy in a bar exclaim at the top of his lungs that \"\"Fear Emptiness Despair\" is the best Napalm Death album\" (Note: I wouldn't make that claim if it hadn't happened to me, in real life), or perhaps the occasional reference to how terrible \"Diatribes\" was, and how \"Inside the Torn Apart\" was the \"only good\" album from this period...but sadly, \"Words from the Exit Wound\" rarely seems to be granted any kind of attention. And, you can't entirely blame people. I mean, just look at that album cover. God-damn. And, of course, the notable absence of the classic Napalm Death logo (which had already been absent for two albums, but, come on, you really can't compare the two, it's obvious which one is superior) in favor of this more \"modern\" looking font, which, while still cool, does (kind of) accurately reflect what one might expect to find within. \n\nAnd by that, I mean that you can expect to hear some vague glimpses of industrial and groove metal, which today would seem extremely \"out-of-date\" (in line with the cover image). The sound which dominated the previous album, \"Diatribes\" has now been reduced to all but ash, in favor of a new sound which combines elements of grindcore and hardcore, which is then doused in death metal gasoline and set alight. But, that's not all one can expect to find here...not by a longshot! Here, one can glimpse the band's first attempts at clean vocals in several tracks, and the band's continual musical evolution into (relatively) uncharted waters with songs such as the slow-paced, yet musically adventurous \"Next of Kin to Chaos\" exemplifying a unique sound, featuring atmospheric guitar licks settled nicely upon pounding drum rhythms and perhaps one of vocalist Barney Greenway's most powerful performances. \n\nWhile this sound is not quite as \"out there\" as the experimental aspects of the previous album, \"Diatribes\", it certainly cements itself as a memorable moment in the history of a band often overlooked as being a \"one trick pony\". On top of that, many of the tracks on this album, despite remaining firmly rooted in familiar territories such as \"death metal\" and \"grindcore\", still manage to possess enough eccentricities to keep the music from ever sounding too much like any specific genre of music. A very good example of this, is the track \"Incendiary Incoming\", which dances between death metal-influenced riffing, and between verses, dabbles in a riff which borders thrash and groove metal, all while keeping a steady, groove-oriented beat underneath it all. An even better example, is the track \"None the Wiser?\". This song is probably the best example of the band's \"experimental\" era, fusing elements of grindcore, death metal, hardcore, industrial rock, and experimental rock (in one way or another), to create a sound not much like anything else. This track (along with \"Repression out of Uniform\") is also notable for featuring one of the first examples of \"clean vocals\" in the band's music, which would eventually become more prominent on albums like \"Time Waits for No Slave\" and \"Utilitarian\". Of course, you could (maybe) point to \"Cold Forgiveness\" on \"Diatribes\" as well, and I've heard \"Evolved as One\" from \"From Enslavement to Obliteration\" being heralded as one of the first examples of clean singing in extreme music period, but this is the first time it's really not arguable, and actually takes a place in the band's music. \n\nThere are also songs which don't seem to mind the more traditional sense of song-writing. Album opener \"The Infiltraitor\" is firmly rooted in the realm of pure, death fucking metal (not far at all from the band's work on the all-time classic \"Harmony Corruption\"), and remains one of the album's highlights, while \"Ulterior Exterior\" showcases a return to the furious, relentless style of grindcore the band left behind after \"Utopia Banished\". However, the band makes a clear attempt to fuse it's past with it's present in tracks like \"Throw Down a Rope\", which happens to be one of the best songs on this album (I mean, just listen to that opening riff...holy crap!). In this case, the band opens the song with a fast-paced and extremely brutal assault of death metal and grindcore, before letting up some of the brutality for it's chorus, in favor of a powerful tom rhythm, and strange sounding tremelo-picked riff. \n\nOverall, this album rocks. I recommend that any Napalm Death fan check it out, it's an interesting album, but at the same time, the band manages to retain their personality to create something unique and refreshing...well, at least for 1998. Please buy the album. Thank you.\n",
        "\nGood, solid, quality grindcore is such a breath of refreshingly caustic air for the seasoned headbanger. For one thing, it's (to this day) the only \"core\" suffixed genre that doesn't seem to cause a mass epidemic of pant-sharting upon it's mention. But...we aren't gonna go there. This is Napalm Death. Either you respect these blokes, or kindly disappear with all of your teeth in place.\n\nThose that know this particular representation of Napalm Death are well aware of the somewhat unsettling lack of furious tempos and theory-disregarding death-punk seizures of noise. We either love it or shun it, the latter merely causing us to reach for their back catalog (or at least skip ahead a few albums for their recaptured rage to be fully intact).\n\nNineties fans of Barney and co. had a soft spot (or at least respect)for the artsier of what alternative music had to offer, realizing that the Helmet-like grooves, Sonic Youth-ey dissonance, and Smashing Pumpkins-isms within the melodic drone department are not just apparent, but intentional. Like I said; nineties FANS of the band know this. That is also my way of implying that not only is it an interesting and worthy integration, it's a damn lethal and brilliant submissiveness that worked beautifully. Ah, those nineties...\n\nHeaviness might be a given when regarding these Birmingham blasters, yet the amount of heft represented here is felt (to these ears) much more oppressively. As Crowbar have demonstrated, one need not turn to their methamphetamines at all times while playing brutally effective music. Fear, Emptiness, Despair has the occasional blast, yet they have proven here that it is not their crutch. It's used as it should be for this kind of record; as an enhancement.\n\nAll this talk of alternative influences is not to say that this is a weak, wiffle ball bat with a Napalm Death tag on it. It's grating, angry, vocally monstrous, and satisfying. This release was the threshold to a small foray into experimentation, but it's undeniably Napalm Death...Mortal Kombat song contribution or not.\n",
        "\nThe Leaders Not Followers EP was the first release from Napalm Death in awhile that seemed to indicate they had a little fire left in their bellies. Coming off the abysmal Words From The Exit Wound, their last record for Earache, and incensed by their acrimonious split from that label, the Brummies cut this one-off covers EP for Relapse and all sounds indicated that things were looking up.\n\nThe selection here is pretty straight-forward: old-school hardcore, punk, grind and death from the early masters who influenced N.D.'s sound. Aside from the Slaughter cover, which I think is pretty dull and not really suited to N.D.'s style of play, these tracks are executed with an enthusiasm and authority missing from the band since the early '90's.\n\nThe covers that hew closer to home sound particularly savage: Death's \"Back From The Dead\" is nice to hear in updated fashion having never gone past the demo stage with Chuck's band; Repulsion's \"Maggots In Your Coffin\" is slightly polished and tightened but with an additional heaviness that I find agreeable; Raw Power's \"Politicians\" gains in unhinged fury, a stronger version than the original. It took me awhile to warm up to N.D.'s take on Pentagram's \"Demonic Possession\" as they add a stronger death metal feel to it but it's grown on me over time.\n\nThese strengths make this EP worth copping but I must be straight about some glaring weaknesses. First, the re-record of \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off\" is totally pointless -- the original version from Virus 100 is far superior; this version sounds sterilized. They also tack on six minutes of silence for a thirty-second interlude at the end making this a must-skip if you are listening to it on iTunes, etc. Also, the production is pretty flawed. Guitars, bass, vocals -- all impressive; but the drums sound like hot plasticized shit. The drums are terrible! Not in the playing but in the recording. Overly triggered, way loud and obnoxious, it's a problem that would occur again on Order Of The Leech.\n\nAfter wandering in the wilderness for over five years, Leaders Not Followers hinted at a promise that would later be fulfilled on Napalm's full-on comeback, Enemy Of The Music Business. Despite any drawbacks, it's an enjoyable listen but in no way an essential one.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death are no strangers to hardcore split seven-inches, having shared wax previously with S.O.B., Electro Hippies, Nasum, & Coalesce. I admit indifference to their latest full-length (Utilitarian) being of the minority opinion that it is one of N.D.'s weakest albums. As for cohorts Converge, they came to hardcore popularity around the time I was leaving the scene. I've investigated their discography somewhat but nothing they've released has struck me as particularly exciting. We'll see how this seven-inch shakes out.\n\nConverge open up with fifty-seconds of pulsating hardcore. \"No Light Escapes\" is a violent pulpy mash of driving beats and coalescing guitar mayhem that unfortunately doesn't come together. The opening terror is sweet, especially with the underlying leads, but the half-time surf-rock interlude just fails as an idea. The finish comes out of nowhere. Jacob Bannon's vocals are ordinary, unequal to the menace hinted at in his music. As for their cover of \"Wolverine Blues,\" it's pale. Not as burly or heavy or threatening or loose-limbed as the original. They tighten up the riff too much. The drums don't swing as hard. It's like they took a needle, stuck it into the original, and sterilized it. As for the cavalcade of guest vocalists, they're a distraction at best. Not one of them touches LGP's visciously unhinged snarl.\n\nThe Napalm side, suffice to say, is better. But I still don't dig it. \"Will By Mouth\" has a very familiar riff. Can't quite pinpoint it but I know Napalm's used it somewhere before. This self-cannibalization has become a problem for them recently. Otherwise the blasting, shrieking ninety-second march of this tune is acceptable if generally uninspired. There's no sense of having not heard this before. \"No Impediment to Triumph (Bhopal)\" is better. I dig the crusty off-time riffs, the scattered drum patterns, and general noise-rock atmosphere. Way more unique and interesting, it held my attention repeatedly. Once they start thrashing away with the double-bass, you feel refreshed and excited. A good track that's hurt by mitigating factors. The first one is Barney's voice: tight, airless, lacking power, it has aged poorly. Compare this painful constriction to the deep, throaty, powerful roars of Order Of The Leech to hear the damage a decade can do. Another problem is the production. I realize they're going for a lo-fi, old-school four track demo-ish sound but this attempt has rendered them paper thin, almost brittle. Between this split and their last two records, I feel like Napalm has passed their resurgent second prime.\n\n\"Will By Mouth\"/\"No Impediment to Triumph (Bhopal):\" 56%\n\"No Light Escapes\"/\"Wolverine Blues (Entombed cover):\" 45%\nTotal: 50.5% (rounded up)\n",
        "\nThis has got to be one of the year\u2019s most highly anticipated split releases (if I need to introduce either of these two heavyweights to you, then you\u2019re reading the wrong site), especially after Converge\u2019s stunning split with fastcore champions Dropdead last year and Napalm\u2019s triumphant return to form (aside from one or two slightly clumsy moments) with \u2018Utilitarian\u2019. These two bands may be firing on all cylinders at the moment, but does this release live up to the hype?\n\nConverge waste no time at all in obliterating the listener\u2019s senses with the furious \u2018No Light Escapes\u2019, a song that will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s caught them live recently. It\u2019s a powerful blast of the kind of chaotic hardcore that only Converge can really pull off, with a fist pumping middle section and a finish that swaggers like Keith Richards hopped up on speedballs and bath salts, all in the space of 50 seconds. In short, it\u2019s totally fucking awesome! Before you\u2019ve had a chance to catch your breath, the band race on, into their star-studded and much-hyped rendition of 'Wolverine Blues'. Given the amount of contemporary hardcore bands taking inspiration from the mighty Entombed at the moment, the fact that Converge have assembled Thomas Lindberg (At The Gates), Aaron Turner (Isis), Kevin Baker (All Pigs Must Die) and Brian Izzi (Trap Them) to cover the Swedish legends seems like a fitting and wholly appropriate tribute. It\u2019s a pretty faithful cover, but Converge nevertheless manage to put their own stamp on this classic song, riding its meaty grooves with confidence and style. If you\u2019re able to resist the urge to bang your head until your brain cells cry out for mercy, you can also have some fun playing \u2018Spot The Vocalist\u2019, with each guest musician taking turns to spit out the lyrics. There\u2019s a real nice atmosphere here, like that time you invited all your mates round to cover a bunch of death metal classics in your garage. Fun vibes, and top riffs \u2013 always a recipe for success!\n\nAny thoughts that Napalm Death may struggle to compete with this fine display are quickly annihilated, as the band fire into action with \u2018Will By Mouth\u2019, one of the most grinding tunes they\u2019ve belted out in years. The song speeds ahead with a breakneck intensity and a genuine sense of righteous indignation, before concluding with a grotty punk-infused ending that would have Extreme Noise Terror fuming with jealousy. \u2018No Impediment To Triumph (Bhopal)\u2019 finds the band playing around with those industrial sounding, Godflesh-esque chord progressions they\u2019ve been using sporadically for the last couple of years, but skewering them with bleak, angular twitches of aggression. The song twists and turns through quite a few turbulent different sections, and is probably one of the more successful of their recent melodic experiments, combining their well-documented Swans obsession with the same unbridled fury that initially made their name. Napalm\u2019s contribution is nothing radically different from the material on their last few albums, but only the most hardened cynic would dismiss this as \u2018Napalm-by-numbers\u2019 \u2013 the band sound fresh, energised and gleefully destructive, with Barney\u2019s vocals especially standing out as sounding particularly vicious, almost straining with sheer venom in places. My only slight gripe is that Shane\u2019s thunderous bass doesn\u2019t ring through quite as clearly as it has done on previous outings, but you\u2019ll probably be grinding along too hard to notice.\n\nSo, to answer my initial question \u2013 yes, this absolutely does live up the hype. It may be short, but this is a textbook example of the phrase \u201call killer, no filler\u201d, with both bands stepping up their game and delivering the goods in abundance. If you\u2019re a fan of either of these bands, you\u2019re probably already cranking this right now, but if not, then you certainly don\u2019t want to miss out on this, a potent reminder of just how good both these acts really are.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.grindtodeath.com\n",
        "\nNapalm Death are an institution. In three decades of existence, they have remained at the forefront of extreme music, constantly evolving and refining their sound while at the same time staying true to the band\u2019s roots in early grindcore and punk. Despite the fact that there are no original members left in the lineup, they have never faltered in quality or watered down their singular vision in order to get ahead; their integrity and dedication has become something of a gold standard by which all other grindcore bands are judged. Utilitarian is Napalm Death\u2019s fourteenth album, and it finds the band sounding as potent and relevant as ever.\n\nOn Utilitarian, Napalm Death continue to operate within the sturdy grindcore/death metal/hardcore framework they\u2019ve built for themselves and have been working to perfect since 2000\u2032s ridiculously corrosive Enemy of the Music Business. The bone-breaking assault of tracks such as \u201cQuarantined\u201d \u201cOrders of Magnitude\u201d and \u201cThink Tank Trials\u201d prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the UK quartet remains a well-oiled killing machine; the level of battering brutality on display is almost frightening. But for all this brutality, Utilitarian is also shockingly catchy; its deep grooves and pummeling punk-derived chord progressions burrow their way into your brain with ruthless, surgical precision. Napalm Death are easily one of the tightest bands in all of metal; just listen to the way they lock in together for a rhythmic beatdown on the bonus track \u201cEverything in Mono.\u201d\n\nAs musically ferocious as Napalm Death are, they\u2019ve also never been afraid to experiment, and Utilitarian sees the band introducing some interesting new elements into the mix, as well as expanding upon previous explorations. Intro track \u201cCircumspect\u201d kicks the album off in doomy, groove-laden fashion, augmented by synths and electronics before dissolving into the explosive \u201cErrors in the Signals.\u201d John Zorn (Painkiller, Naked City, etc) lends his twisted, atonal saxophone playing to \u201cEveryday Pox,\u201d a track that also sees Napalm Death flirting with slower rhythms and layered vocals that recall the likes of Killing Joke and Godflesh, all within the space of two minutes and ten seconds. \u201cFall on their Swords\u201d features an eerie, gothed-up middle section that sounds like an ultra-heavy Bauhaus, replete with deep, Peter Murphy-esque droning vocals. Napalm Death have proved time and again that there is room for progression in grindcore, and Utilitarian just might be their most forward-thinking album yet while losing none of the band\u2019s trademark knack for total musical devastation.\n\nLyrically and aesthetically, Utilitarian finds Napalm Death as politically and socially conscious as ever. If the album\u2019s cover, which features a quartet of corporate lackeys stomping the shit out of the \u201ccommon man\u201d while he\u2019s down (being something of a corporate lackey myself, this image hit particularly close to home) doesn\u2019t give away the album\u2019s basic themes, then biting lyrics such as \u201cThe wolf I feed / Outweighed, policed and rationed / The wolves I feed / Our liberties seized and blackened\u201d from \u201cThe Wolf I Feed\u201d or \u201cTake a hammer to (stifling) traditions / Don\u2019t tread carefully / Yes, we presume with no exceptions / freedom is for free\u201d from \u201cQuarantined\u201d had damn sure better. The band have been raging against the machine for years and show no signs of letting up here.\n\nConsidering the state our world is currently in, we need art to act as a voice of dissent now more than ever. With Utilitarian, Napalm Death are that voice personified for the extreme metal underground, as they have been for the past thirty-one years and will no doubt continue to be until Embury, Harris, Greenway and Herrera are in the ground. Then again, who\u2019s to say that other musicians won\u2019t replace them to take up the mantle, just as they did when the original band members began to drop off? Maybe Napalm Death is eternal.\n\nOriginally written for That's How Kids Die\n",
        "\nUtilitarian is one hell of a album. From the extra heavy and doom-ish intro \u201cCircumspect\u201d to the insane and random noises inserted in the song \u201cRandom Pox,\u201d they bring genuine, authentic grindcore to people who are so bent on the next breakdown it\u2019s pathetic. \u201cCircumspect\u201d is something that Napalm Death has never done before and must be experienced through surround sound.\n\nBut that ends when they through you in the grind pit with \u201cErrors In The Signals.\u201d Insane riffs and spastic guitars are rounded off with the intense drumming that Danny Herrera brings to the table. It\u2019s perhaps the most retro ND track on the album as it has a lot of the same influences that classic albums like Scum had. It\u2019s refreshing to know that these guys can still make the same kind of music and not run out of new directions to bend and twist the grindcore genre to their liking.\n\nBest song on the album goes to \u201cProtection Racket.\u201d Probably the most sinister sounding song on the album, it reflects grindcore with an infusion of d-punk that makes a somewhat more straight forward song structure. Of course, it\u2019s about as straight forward as Napalm Death can get. It has that raw and gritty old school punk sound with more new school punk bass and grindcore guitars. Could this be considered G-Punk? With more of the growling vocals as opposed to the shrieking vocals, it brings forth pure mayhem that are followed by the chaotic drums later in the track.\n\nThis record is chock full of some of Napalm Death\u2019s finest songs ever. Easily one of their best albums to date, you would be a fool to miss out on this.\n",
        "\nFrom the opening notes of \"The Infiltraitor,\" you'd think you are in for a killer ride down Napalm Death lane but alas it's not to be. After delivering a monstrous opener worthy of Napalm's illustrious back catalog, the band slides into a pit of mediocrity and despair almost too pitiable to listen to. If you think Diatribes was Napalm at their worst, you probably haven't heard Words From The Exit Wound.\n\nWhether it's the gobs of clean singing, loads of sluggishly generic mid-paced riffs, weird industrial noise experiments that derail all momentum or the overall sense of malaise and reluctant adherence to worn-out cliches, Words From The Exit Wound has Napalm Death hitting rock bottom -- a condition that would trigger their eventual (and spectacular) return to form. Putting this record on and stacking it against such younger competitors as Nasum or Rotten Sound made N.D. sound like the tired old men many had proclaimed them to be. Hell, Barney Greenway has since noted that it was Nasum who kicked Napalm in the ass and got them grinding again. But to derail as utterly as they did on this record certainly had something to do with it as well.\n\nThere are only three good tracks here, starting with the aforementioned lead-off number. \"The Infiltraitor\" is just vintage N.D. perfection: vicious, assaultive death-grind par-excellence. If you love blast beats, d-beats, and ripping breakdowns, this tracks has them in spades. Just don't look for them anywhere else on this record. Only \"Ulterior Exterior\" & \"Cleanse Impure\" have them. Everything else is heading the wrong direction. Mid-paced, quasi-experimental material needs strong hooks to keep the listener engaged and the remainder of tracks on this album just aren't strong enough to hold my attention.\n\nOne thing I do like is the production. The band sounds huge with snarling guitar tones, chunky bass, and upfront tight drumming. When he's not trying to actually sing, Barney's voice sounds absolutely malevolent, overwhelming the tracks that fail to match his temper. Too bad about that clean singing though. It's retched. This record would also mark the end of Napalm's association with Colin Richardson, whose production here is brilliant even if the material isn't. Only the most committed N.D. junkie needs to spend time with this whole album. For everyone else, I recommend just snatching those three great tracks and letting the rest sink into oblivion.\n",
        "\nInside The Torn Apart finds Napalm Death properly reconstituted and ready to consolidate Diatribes rather meager gains into something altogether leaner and more vicious. In this, they are reasonably successful, though this record serves more as a blip than a true re-awakening. \n\nHaving sent Phil Vane packing back to E.N.T. and reclaiming Barney as their frontman, Napalm regains a bit of lost stride. Barney's time in E.N.T. (however brief) delivered ferocious offerings on Damage 381 and his desire to grind again is evident. There are a lot more blast beats, d-beats, and overall semblances of death-grind here than on Diatribes but there's a few pointless duds along for ride as well.\n\nIronically, \"Lowpoint\" is the highlight with its face-meltingly fast blasts and vintage Terrorizer riffage just bursting with energy and attitude! You even get a sweet Tom G. Warrior \"Ooh\" segueing into a pretty sweet mid-tempo headbanger riff before the whole thing collapses back in on itself with wailing blasts and Barney just killing it on the mic! This song is a fuckin' classic and one of N.D. best mid-period tracks by far. \"Reflect On Conflict\" also kills, delivering crusty d-beat perfection and some wicked double-bass action -- a total whirlwind of kick-ass headbangable riffage! These two tracks alone show more vitality and passion than anything on the previous album. \"If Symptoms Persist\" has a great off-kilter choppy riff that cuts across the rhythm section and stirs enough atmosphere and tension to keep the mid-paced grooves interesting. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention \"Breed To Breathe.\" It's basically \"Greed Killing\" redux with just as many hooks and sick riffs (even the occasional d-beat). And like \"Greed Killing,\" it makes you wonder how much better this whole groove era would've been if they'd honed their other midpaced numbers to the same samurai sharpness.\"Prelude\" too cuts a nice swath between d-beat craziness and tense mid-paced groove, harnessing a balance between styles that Diatribes failed to cohesively find. \n\nDespite a nice infusion of energy and aggression however, Inside The Torn Apart is not without failed experiments. \"Section\" sounds like it's building to something exciting but never releases more than a few bland grooves. \"Down In The Zero\" is more syncopated breakbeats and pointless riffing with no real meat or hooks. Napalm absolutely suck at the Snapcase-style hardcore breakdowns they try to slam in there as well. The whole track is just tedious and passionless. The title track is even worse. The clean singing is horrible! And the riffs are so bland and stale. A total abortion of a song. \"A Lifeless Alarm\" is okay as a dirge but I am sick of Napalm feeling that each record needs one. \n\nThe production is punchy and strong, though the guitars could sound a little sharper. Barney's voice is apex. He's in his prime, hitting his stride. Listening to this again, it's amazing how far his voice has declined now. Too bad he wasted some his prime on these mid-paced misfires. Inside The Torn Apart doesn't totally deliver on all promises and Words From The Exit Wounds would find Napalm sliding back into Diatribes level mediocrity. But hope is just three years around the corner and there's enough blistering material on here to keep the faith holding awhile longer.\n",
        "\nPersonally, I've never had any problems with Napalm Death's newer records. Some say they aren't as brutal or as good as the first three. My first contact with the band was their fifth studio album 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair' in 1994, so I guess I'm a new wave Napalm Death fan. I never found much meat on 10 second songs, anyways.\n\nAt first 'Words from the Exit Wound' was an uneasy album. It was very hard to get into, but when I played it enough, it blasted my world. It still does, even more. I never get bored with the band's \"weirder than usual\" time signatures, sick riffing or Barney Greenway's dry throat, which clearly shouts for more beer. Colin Richardson's heavy and powerful, yet clean (everything's well audible) production is manna for listeners' ears. And there's some extremely meaty riffing on offer, thanks to Mitch Harris' and Jesse Pintado's marvelous fretwork! Danny Herrera beats some very groovy and individual (I really mean individual) rhythms out of his drum kit, so maybe some can't take this. But believe me, there's a lot of blast beat (or whatever fast stuff) coming your way. Shane Embury's bass does devastating work on lower levels. Even though this album's musical yield doesn't differ a lot from a couple of previous records style, it is more refined and certainly sounds different enough.\n\nBarney's throat is in a good shape and he gets more varied grunts, roars and shouts out of him than usually. Just listen him spitting out his anger on 'The Infiltraitor', for example. He also sings a few lines with his clean voice, too, but thank god not many. Guitarist Mitch Harris' uglier than ugly shriek is also present, of course. Lyrics are aimed towards society's crap. The usual Napalm Death stuff all the way...\n\nI must say I simply love this record. There's no \"just okay\" songs, every one of them is great. Give this enough time, because I certainly needed it. At the first material sounds a bit one-dimensional, but just wait! Napalm Death have their own sound and style. Maybe not as much grind than on the first few records, but there's death metal, industrial edge and well... Hmmmm... Metal!!! This is heavier than previous, say, two albums, and mauls like hell so get wasted.\n\n(originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2002)\n",
        "\nNapalm Death truly need no inrtoduction to metal fans. Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 20 years, you would know that Napalm Death are one of the most revered bands, not only in grindcore, but extreme metal in general. They have been releasing consistantly superb albums on a nearly yaer-to-year basis. Their latest is no exception.\n\nUtilitarian is a prime example of Napalm Death's trademark brand of chaotic grindcore, but what really makes this album great is the careful hints of experimentation. Be it the industrial-tinged intro (\"Circumspect\"), a visit from the saxiphonist from Hell, John Zorn,(\"Everday Pox\"), the Gregorian chants on \"Fall On Their Swords\", or the Burton C. Bell-esque clean vocals on \"The Wolf i Feed\", this album packs some pleasant surprises.\n\nBarney's vocals sounds as pissed off as ever, the guitars have a great crunch to them, the bass really holds it's own, and the drums are brilliant as always. Another great thing about this album is the atmosphere it creates. \"Blank Look About Face\" is the kind of song that just makes you want to start a riot for no real reason at all. All in all, Napalm Death have never disapointed me in the past and this is no different. It will certainly be in my top 5 for the year.\n\nFavorite Tracks: \"Analysis Paralysis\", \"Leper Colony\", \"Everyday Pox\", \"Blank look About Face\", \"The Wolf I Feed\" and \"Errors In the Signals\"\n",
        "\nFew bands always deliver. To say Napalm Death is among those few bands would be a colossal understatement. To put it bluntly, listening to Napalm Death is pretty much mandatory. The more albums a mandatory band such as this one puts out, the more interesting a task it becomes to put the newcomers up against an already-immense discography. Needless to say, after spending an entire month listening to virtually every release from Scum to the band's latest, one would hope to be able to come to some insigntful and proper conclusions as to where Utilitarian stands by comparison, and to where the band may be headed regarding future endeavours. But before all that is discussed, there are some pressing extra-curricular activities regarding Utilitarian that need to be addressed.\n\nWhile Utilitarian may focus heavily on current events such as the recent Occupy movements, it's not really a new thing for Barney Greenway to speak his mind on current events. Therefore, while most of you were off rioting and protesting, I was left alone like the last kid in the sandbox -- except my sandbox was the streets of New Orleans and my play shovel was my bright and shiny new copy of the Utilitarian compact disc. And that's when madness started. First, I discovered that the CD is a pretty cool boomerang. If you throw it at a fast enough velocity, it will decapitate anyone within a hundred-mile radius before making its way back to its rightful owner. Next, I realized that holding the CD at the proper angle magnifies the reflection one thousand-fold, allowing the beholder to permanently blind anyone they hate. Finally, I started to notice that Utilitarian, when played at high levels, serves as a pretty good scrambler for radar detectors, police radios, and any other devices our uniformed babysitters may use to protect us. Think I'm kidding? You'll never know until you try it.\n\nFor those who are either hearing impaired or have yet to discover the fact that Century Media has been streaming Utilitarian on its website, Napalm Death's latest effort could be described as something of progressive grindcore. No, it's not the cacophonous saxophone segments featured in \"Everyday Pox\" that make the group's fourteenth full-length outstanding, even though those don't hurt the results one bit. Utilitarian is all about atmosphere, and it's strange that the cover bears a striking resemblance to the all-time classic, From Enslavement To Obliteration, which is the first instance in which Napalm Death reinvented itself for the better. \"Circumspect,\" the album's intro, is downright chilling, almost to the extent that I thought I had accidentally ordered some unreleased material from UK counterparts Dave Hunt and Mick Kenney upon first listen. Diving further into the album will lead the listener to find much of the same songwriting structure a-la Shane Embury that has graced every album since Enemy of the Music Business. What's different this time around is the sheer density of the fucking thing. It truly sounds better than any grindcore album that has ever been produced. But does that mean it is better? Let's do some brief comparisons, shall we?\n\n2009's Time Waits For No Slave is among the best grindcore albums of all time, if not the best. To be hit with \"Strongarm\" right out of the starting blocks is nothing short of cathartic. After hearing the production samples of Utilitarian, all hopeful fans expected much of the same, but in even more bombastic fashion. Unfortunately, that's not quite what Napalm Death has served up this go-around. The thing about Utilitarian is that the delivery doesn't quite outweigh the anticipation. It's not until the one-and-one-half minute mark into the fourth track, \"Protection Racket,\" that the infamous Embury groove finally comes into play, albeit without accompaniment from those \"Diktat\" moments of perfect brutality.\n\nAlthough the album is a bit slow to open up, by the time \"Think Tank Trials\" leads its way into the death march that is \"Blank Look About Face,\" the record, along with all of its quirky new additions, will have easily won over the hearts of the fans. The frequency of Greenway's Victorian-esque clean vocals -- the best of which are demonstrated on \"Fall On Their Swords\" -- add another new aspect to the band's sound. Mitch's raspy growls also give Utilitarian a refreshing yet crusty vibe on the throwdown track, \"Orders of Magnitude.\" Other smash hits include \"Leper Colony\" and \"Analysis Paralysis,\" or rather the \"Life And Limb\" of the album. Weighing in at roughly forty-six minutes, these seventeen tracks make up what will likely be one of the best grindcore albums of the year.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, Napalm Death has zero throwaway albums, a small handful of average ones (Fear, Emptiness, Despair, Diatribes), a very generous helping of records that easily destroy every other grindcore outfit out there, and a few timeless classics that are absolutely mandatory for everyone (From Enslavement To Obliteration, Time Waits For No Slave, Harmony Corruption). While Utilitarian doesn't quite fit into the \"best of\" category, one shouldn't go so far as to say it isn't mandatory, because Utilitarian pushes boundaries that even Time Waits... does not. Napalm Death has advanced its sound in every single aspect, and it has done so without even so much of a hiccup in its discography. Lord only knows what would happen if the powers of Utilitarian and its predecessor were to someday combine forces in some dark alleyway of Birmingham. \n\nOriginally written for MetalReview.com\n",
        "\nWhat can be said about this album that hasn't already been said? It truly is the magnum opus of the genre (just barely outclassing Symphonies... and Horrified). It set the standard that all grind bands in the '90s and the new millennium have tried to match. Musically, it's not that far removed from side two of Scum and Reek..., but because of the cold, harsh production it's more aesthetically pleasing than the other two, and not to mention Mick's drumming is much tighter than Ken's (though Ken's drumming on every subsequent Carcass release is top notch).\n\nLee's voice is the grindcore equivalent of Tom Araya. Powerful, percussive, and just so alive. While there are grind bands that have objectively better vocals (in the sense that you can decipher the lyrics), Lee's voice here just hits your eardrums like a sledgehammer. Not even Bill's vile and rotten gutturals on Reek... and Symphonies... match the indescribable greatness on this album. Speaking of Bill, his riffing here is more or less the same as it is on Reek of Putrefaction, but because of the higher tuning and better production it stands on its own to feet. While his playing here is simplistic and immature compared to Carcass and Firebird, it reflects what grind and hardcore are all about: aggression and passion. Mick's drumming is a chaotic flurry of up-tempo punk grooves and unrelenting blast beats, made even more chaotic by the reverberating production. Shane's bass is buried under all the chaos caused by Bill, Lee, and Mick, but you can't go bassless. If you did, it would probably sound hollow and weak. \n\nSince death metal was in its infancy in '88, there's very little death metal influence on this record as opposed to most grind records, and surprisingly enough, there is also very little thrash to be heard (which is where the early European grind differs from early American grind). Instead you get what is pretty much Discharge, Doom, and Crass with the metronome turned all the way up. \n\nLyrically, they kept to the formula of anti-establishment idealism present in nearly any socially conscience punk band. Though where Scum points out the corruption of western society in the '80s, FETO presents a myopic and disturbingly realistic dystopia that constantly punishes the everyday working man.\n\nThe only standout track is the doom opener \"Evolved as One\", as every other track is essentially crust punk on amphetamines and steroid-induced rage. An essential album for any grind aficionado or anyone who wants to look into what grind is all about.\n",
        "\nCoherence. This is the first phrase that popped into my head when I heard the new album by Napalm Death. Integrity is another phrase that complements the first and, finally, aggressive, very aggressive, is the final word that closes this comment.\n\nOf course, all production of Napalm Death has progressive and strange contraptions such as the introduction \"circumspect\", follow by brutal grindcore attacks like \"Errors In The Signals\", with a choppy start repeating a few times.\n\n\"Everyday Pox\" sounds strange, without doubt, for that attack dissonant alto sax performed by John Zorn, but in any case, a song full of blast beats and devastating guitar at full speed. No time to breathe straight cuts appear as \"Protection Racket\". \"The Wolf I Feed\" is a focused theme certainly a trend in punk and hardcore, \"Quarantined\" is a song that I love because it includes some awesome blastbeats and some brutal guitar riffs centered.\n\nThe rhythm section rumbles with a devastating sound contingency on \"Fall On Their Swords\". From here, are some of the most savage of the album: \"Collision Course\", \"Orders of Magnitude\" or \"Think Tank Trials\", these in typical grindcore: distortion brutal, crushing guitar and sharp as an axe , times dizzying and (of course), devastating blast beats, as only Danny Herrera knows. \"Blank Look About Face\" is a subject in which the protagonist is the chorus, one of the highlights of the song, shouting \"Look About Face Blank\" almost all the time.\n\n\"Leper Colony\" is one of those typical themes of Napalm Death, those issues that differ from the rest with some unusual parts at the beginning and again based on a core riffs.\n\n\"Nom de guerre\" lasts just 1 minute, destructive rage on the increase and speed define this song. And so are the other cuts happening, for example, \"Analysis Paralysis\", close to progressive, \"Opposites Repellent\" returns to the punk creeping and \"A Gag Reflex\" off an excellent album. a repeated final seal of this production: powerful sound of drums and guitar riffs conjoined to the angry vocal cords Mark Greenway.\n\nNapalm Death does not disappoint or loosen a centimeter. Highly recommended.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death are the most consistently excellent extreme metal band in the world. As bold a statement as that may be, Napalm Death have released 14 full-length albums over the past quarter century in an extremely intense part of the metal spectrum, and they have remained every bit as relevant as any band in their sphere. I can't think of a single other pioneering group from black metal, death metal, or grind that was releasing albums of the same intensity as these guys back in the 80s and has continued to produce equally strong material into the present day without any significant gaps.\n\nWith all that said, I assume most readers will be at least passingly familiar with the group, so I shouldn't have to spend a great deal of time describing the way this sounds. For those who don't know them, the extreme end of hardcore punk fused with the angriest part of metal back in the 80s to form grindcore, and Napalm Death were the band right at the heart of that development. They are the prototype on which all other grind is based and built. The instantly recognizable Barney Greenway bellows out his social rage in front of churning guitar riffs, gritty bass lines, and wildly fast drumming.\n\nUtilitarian continues the band's more recent trend of incorporating more death metal elements into their traditional grind sound. Personally, I actually prefer this hybrid style to the band's older material, as the fuller song lengths and the inclusion of some meaty death metal riffs adds more structure, allowing the songs to fully develop. It costs nothing in the intensity department, and I think it significantly enhances the overall sound and enjoyability of the listening experience.\n\nPart of what has kept Napalm Death so effective for so long is their willingness to change and grow and experiment with their sound. They have kept close enough to their original formula that they have never lost their identity, and they have been judicious enough with their divergences that they have never \"sold out\". The group throw a few experimental touches in here, too. They open with an instrumental track, not typical for them, but it sounds good. At barely over two minutes long, it's just the right length to serve as an excellent warm-up to the album. The tempos, rather than maintaining pure balls-to-the-wall speed in every track, vary enough to maintain interest and help to distinguish the songs more clearly from one another in their tone and approach. In some tracks, like \"Everyday Pox\" and \"Quarantined\", the group also include some wild, squealing horn work that accentuates and heightens the mad frenzy of the music.\n\nOther departures are not quite so welcome. The inclusion of clean singing on some of the tracks is the really notable example of this. In some places, like on the previously mentioned \"Quarantined\", the intrusion is minimal and the overall effect, while not exactly an enhancement, is at least not a significant annoyance. In \"The Wolf I Feed\", on the other hand, the clean vocals are weird and off putting. Largely due to those vocals, that particular track stands out to me as a jarringly bad song on an otherwise very good album.\n\nDespite that particular knock, this is still a very strong and enjoyable album. I'm not sure that it's my favorite from their newer catalog, but the majority of the material is as good as anything else the band has produced in recent years.\n\n(Originally published on beardsetc.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\n'Fear, Emptiness, Despair' is the first Napalm Death (ND from now on) album I got, thanks to Earache sampler featuring 'Hung' and 'Plague Rages'. I had heard the band before on MTV's Headbanger's Ball show, but that's not the right place for this kind of music, is it? No, it sounded like unintelligent noise on my shit telly.\n\nBeing the pioneers of grindcore, ND's fifth album has long songs (but no original members). Yes, the band wanted to slow down a bit, because getting bored on fast-as-fuck stuff. Understandable, I think. ND didn't sell out. This is sick music, much sicker than majority of older stuff from the band. I'm not a fan of 10 second songs, they usually bore me. Based on grincore, the band expanded into new territories with this album. Cold industrial feel make the album brutal experience like real life. Mitch Harris' (ex-Righteous Pigs, ex-Defecation, Meathook Seed) and Jesse Pintado's (ex-Terrorizer, Lock Up) sharp guitars bore into listener's brain without remorse, leaving shards of cutter in grey mass to cause traumas. Experimenting with different guitar tones, there's varying atmosphere fitting with words \"fear\", \"emptiness\" and \"despair\". Death metal bits are still in, thanks to heavy, thick guitar sound and some riffing. Coarse tones are warmer, but still fucking lethal! Dissonance is ever present. There's very fast bits in some songs, just try 'Primed Time' and 'Throwaway', but they always have slower parts. The slower movements bring in loads of groove, and better possibilities to survive moshing and headbanging this album will surely cause. Danny Herrera's drumming is not only incredibly fast at parts, but also very accurate. His style is unimitable. Time changes and original rhythms still include more straight blast beats, double kick drumming and punky beats, but usually all carry Mr. Herrera's signature. Shane Embury's (ex-Brujeria, ex-Unseen Terror, ex-Malformed Earthborn, Lock Up) bass is heavy and distortion rips. This music is closest to controlled chaos, that I've heard.\n\nMark \"Barney\" Greenway (ex-Benediction, ex-Extreme Noise Terror) barks (his trademark) his lungs out. The man shouts, growls and generally sounds as angry as possible. Sometimes he does his thing at different tempo (when he feeling ready to go for it), which is a nod to older, more chaotic times of ND. There's no hint of melody in the man's voice, he uses tempos. Mr. Harris provides some very fucking nasty inhuman shrieks. Social commentary (nuclear weapons race, racism etc.) is a big part of lyrical theme, but also feelings of a wretched human being. Suicidal thoughts, loss of friends, loss of individuality, such topics. Simplistic cover art is good all around and the lyrics are printed, although Mr. Greenway's outlet is comprehensible this time.\n\nThe album was recorded by Pete Coleman, but remastered by Colin Richardson. As mentioned, heavy guitars are very thick, possibly layered. Sharp guitars and noises can really send shooting pain through teeth. Bass adds very low frequencies. Together with heavy guitars a huge wall of sound is created. Drums are good. Tight snare might be a bit too echoing, making it a tad powerless and thin. Balanced well, vocals rage on the top, maybe feeling this way because they are only human thing (well, at least remotely, heh) here.\n\n'Fear, Emptiness, Despair' sounds exactly what its title says. But how can it sound this good, then? A paradox. More coherent song writing and incredible performance from the band raise this album to classic rank. For me, this is the best Napalm Death.\n\n(originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2004)\n",
        "\nThis album is no recycled crap a lot of bands seem to be okay with releasing. This one really takes you back to the \"good ole days\". This is one of those moments where if Napalm Death were to release this with poor studio quality and just SAY they were unreleased tracks from back in the eighties; people would believe them. That is what makes Napalm so great; their consistency. The late eighties ND to a bit more specific.\n\nThe easiest way to describe this album is to compare it to an older one, and with the 80's being mentioned, it would seem to be most similar to ND's second work, \"From Enslavement To Obliteration\". The one thing that the earlier album had (besides the svper kvlt recording) that this one does not, is the short thirty second songs. Those would have made this album a landmark in history. To be fair though, the second to last track \"Opposite Repellent\" is a brief minute and five seconds long, with the actual music kicking in at the 10 second mark. It also has the classic feedback in the beginning. For anyone who is partial to saying ND doesn't have it anymore just needs to hear that track to have their faith in them restored.\n\nThe intro track in the very beginning of the CD has a very eerie vibe to it. That has been consistent compared to their other recent releases. If they were to actually perform that intro live it would be just devastating! Then the next track kicks you right in the teeth with the speed! The first thing that comes to everyone's mind when the name Napalm Death comes up is how stupid fucking fast they are! And then in the next track, they bring in the \"noise\" here in the chorus with a sound that is very hard to describe. Almost as if they were letting the air squeak out of a balloon! Most of all however, what really will hook you into this album is track 5, \"The Wolf I Feed\". It has the upbeat skanking riff that has almost a crossover sound for a second. Mitch Harris has such an incredible voice. When you have him and Barney trading vocals in a track it. But the guitar riff in the beginning of that track is what makes it!\n\nHow many lifetimes would you have to live to come up with as many riffs as these dudes do? The thought alone is just baffling. Every track on this record has a riff that will either make you want to mosh or throw your arms up in the air at the sound of sheer terror! Besides the fore mentioned track 5 there is some very choice riffage in \"Nom de Guerre\" (the whole song!) and in \"Opposite Repellent\" at around :42. Also in the preview track \"Leper Colony\" there is some monster riffage (http://youtu.be/I0NqN6mGO2g?t=1m34s). Those riffs alone will convince you to pic this gnarly bastard up!\n\nThese guys haven't turned their backs to the music they set out to create, and by now it is pretty obvious that these legends never will. Their previous recent releases were amazing, and this album is most definitely a step above them!\n\nFavorite Track: The Wolf I Feed, Nom de Guerre, Opposite Repellent\n",
        "\nAs a long haired, cassette buying seventeen-year old metal head in 1996, Diatribes was an important album for me. It's thick grooves, slick production, and catching material was an excellent recruitment tool for borderline extremists looking for a toehold away from the Pantera/Prong/White Zombie axis of acceptable mainstream heavy metal. Fear, Emptiness, Despair had put the fear in them (a still heavily death metal accentuated album) while their earlier material was sheer hell on ears. Diatribes had the hooks those records lacked. The mid-90's was all about the groove and chug. Whether post-thrash or metalcore, Helmet worship was the dominant paradigm and Napalm Death bought into it all the way. \n\nLooking back on it now, I can see why Diatribes is so heavily maligned. There are some great songs on here. But for each exceptional track, there's several tepid mid-tempo numbers that dare to tread water. As such there isn't much to recommend here beyond a few key tracks that time has done little to undermine.\n\n\"Greed Killing\" bolts out the gate with huge hooks and catchy choruses. It's a neck-snapper, breathing fresh air into the Napalm Death template. Brazenly flirting with mainstream song structure, this track still screams anger and spits vitriol. Perfectly written, \"Greed Killing\" only serves to further highlight how flaccid the rest of the songwriting is. \"Glimpse Into Genocide\" chugs along nicely enough (with a super performance from Danny Herrera on drums) but never truly amounts to much. In comparison, \"Ripe For The Breaking\" is completely kick-ass. The ferocity of its opening segueing into beautiful atmospheric clean tones before returning to a thickening boil. Barney's voice dominates on top here, delivering strong vocal lines and displaying a passion clearly lacking on other tracks. \"Cursed To Crawl\" reeks of overreaching outside influence, its bland grooves baldly lifted from of-the-moment hardcore bands like Snapcase & Earth Crisis. \"Cold Forgiveness\" is a boring take on a droning dirge structure that N.D. seems prone to play with on nearly every record. This one just doesn't live up. \"My Own Worst Enemy\" has a nice intro riff that gets lost among the mindless chugs and syncopated drum beats. \"Just Rewards\" rides the shit out of a classic NYHC style breakdown and features some slammin' double-bass yet still somehow fails to cohere as a song. However the title track just shreds -- a classic run of insane windmilling death-grind that will make you pine for what this record could've been. The remaining tracks are merely competent groove numbers that wear thin any remaining patience I have with this record.\n\nDiatribes is a paradoxical album that alienated many. Yet without it, myself and many others might not have taken the longer journey into metal's more extreme hinterlands. So I can remain grateful to it while echoing those who have affirmed its bottom feeding status within the Napalm canon. Those interested in what could've been would do well to check out Extreme Noise Terror's Damage 381, which Barney recorded during his brief post-Diatribes split with the band. It more than adequately bridges the gap that this record (and the two after it) fell into.\n",
        "\nAll that I can shockingly say when I first heard this was \"wow, what a hell of an album!\" If your desire is to know what an ideal grindcore/death metal release or more particularly Napalm Death's best work to date, this one is it. Some accusations here I've heard is that Napalm Death copied the Floridian grindcore/death metal sound of the early 90's. While I say yes there are similarities, I still feel \"Harmony Corruption\" is original as is all of the Napalm Death albums that I've heard. This one has the most sickest guitar work, vocals and drums that an album needs in order to coin it as a quality release.\n\nLet's look at the sound and riff structure first off. If you have the metal zone pedal more power to ya because the distortion here is maxed out. If you haven't heard this album, the crunch tone is monumental and contains so much thick fuzz that an amplifier can dish out. Next, the riff writing was not overtly complicated and technical. It is just heavy, fast and insanely intense. Their riffs are composed of bar chord usage, tremolo picked notes and fueled with so much energy. To me, the riffs were wholly amazing and flowed well for each song. The production makes the music a little bit hard to hear everything though, that's the only downside. So the album has a little bit of a \"live\" sound to it. However, all of the instruments and vocals were well mixed together despite this.\n\nMy favorite feature of the album are the drums. Why though? A name that may be long forgotten: Mick Harris. This guy tore it up. It was his next to last effort with the band entirely and his energy is astounding, but yet his drum lines are basic and well fitting. One thing that will pump you up is the blast beating. If you have \"Live Corruption\" (1992), you'll know what I mean because you get to see him in action. His efforts make the songs sound more intense and fast. The band as a whole contributed the most ever and every member was at their best.\n\nOne of the fastest and most invigorating experiences are viewed on \"Live Corruption\". Mick kept the band intense, brutal and insane which is something they have lacked since his departure. For Mark \"Barney\" Greenway, their vocalist, this his first effort with the band and best one to date. To compare, he's similar sounding to Frank Mullen of Suffocation, but seems to have a sustain that's longer and more instances where he's bellowing out his vox. The vocals therefore makes things fitting and exciting. Another note here, John Tardy (Obituary) and Glen Benton (Deicide/Vital Remains) are guest backup vocalists for the song \"Unfit Earth\".\n\nThe promise of \"Harmony Corruption\" is a great one because this album remains in the grindcore/death metal archives forever for being one of the best records ever made. I don't like the newer lineup and all of the other Napalm Death releases that I've heard haven't been as original and classic grindcore/death metal as this one was. What stood out the most again are the vocals, the guitars, and the drums. Everything was fueled and fueled with vigor. I discount other Napalm Death releases and refuse to listen to any of other one of theirs because they're not even close to sounding as good as \"Harmony Corruption\" is. Old Napalm Death is dead, long live old Napalm!\n",
        "\nA live DVD from Napalm Death (ND from now on). What do you expect from it? Exactly. Pure aggressive energy. No flashy stage sets, lighting, image etc. ND do what is the most important thing in live music; they deliver. So, if you want something else than excellent live music, look somewhere else. Maybe some Britney Spears video for you, then...\n\nMain event was filmed in ULU, London on April 27th 2002. A benefit show for S.H.A.C. - the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaing - against animal testing. ND are well known for their political and social commentary in their lyrics. In this gig, punks, metalheads and other fans of aural brutality gathered to witness a musical equivalent to *insert here whatever you find extremely ferocious*. Consisting of 28 songs, this is a nice overview of ND classics and newies and three covers. Even if I don't find all my faves here and some less favourite songs, this is a very enjoyable batch of songs, thanks to the band's unbelievably exact yet groovy performance. The crowd enjoys the show and \"some\" moshing, headbanging and stage diving can be seen. Only some bastard want to stand on stage for long time. The stage itself is quite small and guys can't move too much. Guitarists Mitch Harris and Jesse Pintado stand and headbang, bassist Shane Embury moves a bit more and vokillist Barney Greenway seems to follow same footsteps throughout the gig, between the front of the stage and a few steps back next to drums (well, he needs to drink because his growl/bark is certainly abusive for his throat). Talking about drums, Danny Herrera is unbelievable; how can a man play drums like that fast and accurate. As this is live, some of the songs are actually a bit faster than on record. Well, I've witnessed it with my own eyes and ears now and I can tell you this is a totally inhuman show! I can't still understand how this kind of talent can exist. ND's music is a mixture of punk, grindcore and death metal, and they sound fucking original as they have always sounded.\n\nPicture is okay. This looks real, sharp and no effects are used. I think this was recorded with 6 or so cameras only, but this is enough, since the venue is quite small. Sound is great, with every instrument and vocals well audible, plus crowd noise. Basically it's completely WYSIWYG stuff.\n\nDocumentary is good for a ND newbie, and even long-term fans of the band might find something new. Every guy is interviewed, Barney and Shane talking most, Mitch and Jesse some and Danny only once. The documentary was recorded before the show. The tension grows nicely, I mean at first guys are calm, but towards the end they almost shit themselves, he. The extras are okay. Santiago concert is better with many cameras and okay sound, but the two Tokyo songs are of pure bootleg quality. One camera in the crowd, but still the songs are easily recognizable. A short history etc. could have been nice. A small booklet is included.\n\nThis DVD is a must for those who want pure live energy and all other stuff is secondary. This kind of ferocity is rarely seen on DVD. ND fans should love it, others will love it. If they do not go deaf.\n\n(originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2004)\n",
        "\nI've heard numerous times that \"Scum\" is the first pure grindcore album and I almost completely agree. I've also heard that \"Scum\" is the worst album ever made. I can see the validity in this claim as this album is very repetitive and the production is pretty lousy. Although, the songwriting is solid and for the repetitiveness, isn't all grindcore just a little repetitive?\n\nI'll start with the production. It's not good. The guitars sound like a bad punk sound. They are nothing like Napalm's F.E.T.O. album in terms of amazing production. The drums are the savior of the sound. I really like the drum sound on here: very raw and intense. The bass is heavily distorted and is audible throughout. The vocals are quiet, especially because the drums sound loud.\u00a0\n\nThe songs are like ultra-fast hardcore punk but with that essence of true grindcore attitude. Kind of like \"fuck you music\" attitude displayed by a lot of punks and grindcore bands. This is really shown throughout. \"Multinational Corporations\" is the standard atmospheric intro song. \"The Kill\" is very short and with a very simple riff and structure manages to leave somewhat of an impression of the grindcore attitude. Short and very aggressive. The title track is like something that could be found on their second album. After the heavy intro to the song that actually has a pretty awesome riff, the blasting begins and the heaviness comes back even better than before. Many songs are very similar to \"The Kill\", short and blasting through just like awesome grindcore should be. \"Success\" is definitely the best song on here. The awesome drum beat with the amazing riff really stands out among the rest.\u00a0\n\nI'm not really sure how to talk about the line-up because I know nothing of why the line-up is so strange, but both line-ups do a good job on here, yet the side with Lee and Bill are just slightly better, but that is to be expected from Bill.\u00a0\n\nThe first true grindcore album and it has some pretty significant flaws as with any genre defining album. Don't listen to the people who say this is THE worst album ever. I think that may be a slight exaggeration. Definitely check this out if you love grindcore.\n\nBest tracks - \"You Suffer\", \"Success\", \"Scum\", and \"Siege of Power\".\n",
        "\nAging tends to mellow metal bands. It's hard to sustain anger and momentum when you're trending toward middle age. But somehow Napalm Death have managed to become even more extreme in the last decade: matching (and in some instances even surpassing) the hellish levels of youthful revolt unleashed on their earliest records. Smear Campaign, coming knee-deep in ND's resurgent third-act, finds the band at their crustiest, grinding best. This record scorches the earth, incinerating all with its rabidly passionate and punishing death-grind.\n\nThe 'Weltschmerz' intro is all gothic fake-out -- a real head-scratcher and a hilarious set-up to 'Sink Fast, Let Go,' a song I'd argue is one of the most insane things ND has ever unleashed: a maelstrom of corruscating blasts, dueling vox, and a wicked Celtic Frost slowdown that flails with a reckless, almost hedonistic abandon. This track puts imitators in thrall of the originators, fulfilling the promise of everything from Enemy Of The Music Business onwards. With such a full-throttle start, you'd expect a slackening, a breather, but it never comes. Other ND records can slow down, play around with tempo and texture, get experimental. Not this one. The chip of relentless grind is on their shoulders here and the result is a non-stop barrage of crusty, brutal, cacophonous grind. And because they are such smart songwriters, the onslaught never grows wearying or dull. The few wrinkles they add (smatterings of NYHC, Big Black noise, and Anneke van Giersbergen's creepy spoken-word) are all tasteful and complimentary to the punishment served.\n\nIf there's one reservation I hold, it's with the production. The band sounds tight and fierce with all instruments perfectly captured and tracked. It's a precision sound that works perfectly, except with Barney's vocals, which sound airless, tired, and undermixed. It seems sad for his voice to start failing him just as the band is once again musically peaking. Compared to his delivery just two-or-three records ago, the decline is somewhat startling. Live he still can bring the oomph so I think a large part of the fault lies in the recording. It's a minor flaw, however, because even heard at a disadvantage, Barney has one of metal's most distinctive and capable voices. Add that Mitch Harris really steps-up his harsh shrieking and you get a two man vocal terrorizer team, a tired cliche in most grind but a welcome refresher here.\n\nWhile not ND's best record, Smear Campaign is easily the most violent. And its unremitting heart beats in both anger and compassion for those whom society and religion has abused at whim. Anyone who has ever dabbled their toes in death, crust, grind, or d-beat should find something rewarding to here.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death\u2026widely regarded as the first true grindcore band. \u201cScum\u201d was the first but I feel like it sounded too punk and \u201cFrom Enslavement to Obliteration\u201d was the first \u201ctrue\u201d grindcore sound. \n\nThe music is one thing, grind. Every song exemplifies what grindcore is to me. Blast beats are the most used drum beat along with a lot of thrash beats. They slow it down occasionally such as in \u201cUnchallenged Hate\u201d. The riffs are punk influenced riffs but the guitars are so freakin heavy that some of riffs come off as death metal riffs. \u201cUnchallenged Hate\u201d has an amazingly heavy riff. It is easily the best song on here. The title track also has an incredible riff and stands out among the rest. The songs are pretty short, the longest song is just over 3 minutes long and it\u2019s more of an atmospheric into than anything else. Most of the songs are between 1 and 1:30 long, perfect for grindcore. \n\nProduction is pretty amazing. Guitars are heavy but are kind of fuzzy during the really fast riffs, which take up most of the album. The bass is super LOW, like it should be. It\u2019s not overpowering in the mix but you can definitely tell it\u2019s there, more like feel it\u2019s there. The drums sound good, but the cymbals are very tinny and the snare could be louder during blast beats. Lee Dorrian\u2026this guy has the best grindcore vocals I\u2019ve ever heard. He might only say a few \u201clyrics\u201d every song but wow this guy has some energy. He is super guttural and his highs actually sound painful. Easily my favorite grindcore singer for sure. \n\nSo if you\u2019re looking at the beginnings of grind, this is a necessity. Everything about this album is amazing and is definitely my favorite grindcore album ever. \n\nBest tracks \u2013 \u201cPractice What You Preach\u201d, \u201cUnchallenged Hate\u201d, and \u201cFrom Enslavement to Obliteration\u201d\n",
        "\nThis is the album that set the standard for what grindcore should be. Napalm Death's debut album, Scum, was what gave birth to the genre we know as grindcore, but it mostly sounded like sped up hardcore punk. Which wasn't a bad thing at all, Scum is a fantasic album, but From Enslavement to Obliteration (FETO for short) gave the grindcore genre a solid identity. This album doesn't sound like sped up hardcore punk, and it doesn't sound like death metal. For its time, it was unique, and some would say still is, because no other album better advertises the fury expected from grindcore songs than this one.\n\nThe album packs twenty two songs into thirty minutes. Bonus versions include a few more tracks, which don't sound out of place at all and fit seamlessly into the feel and mood of the album. As expected from grindcore, few songs run for more than three minutes. The average length for them is around a minute. And the band makes full use of that time to craft memorable songs. The album is best enjoyed when listened to in a single sitting, which if you have an ear for extreme music, shouldn't be a problem considering the ridiculous amount of catchy riffs.\n\nFrom the lineup that recorded side one of Scum, only Mick Harris remained, who apparently decided to keep the band going. Lee Dorrian joined as vocalist and subsequent grindcore legend Bill Steer as guitarist, with Jim Whitely on bass. While this lineup did offer up side two of Scum, it was mostly a lacklusture effort when compared with side one. However, it was a glimpse of what was to come, and come FETO, on which Shane Emburey replaced Whitely, they did deliver a masterpiece.\n\nWords cannot do justice to Steer's guitar tone on the album. It contends with his tone on Carcass' Symphonies of Sickness as possibly the grimiest tone I've ever heard. Very harsh and cold sounding. It is a significant part of what provides the album its grittiness. Mick Harris is maniacally fast. You won't hear many cute fills or time changes here. He mostly flits between a steady beat and hyperspeed blasts that sound like he's hitting everything in his kit at once. Plenty of cymbal use as well. Basically, his performance is what drives the chaos on the album. Shane Emburey's bass is barely audible, but it's doing its job, which is to add an almighty rumble to the bottom end of the riffs. Which is perfect. The riffs sound absolutely monstrous with Steer's guitar tone and Emburey's bass following the guitar. Lee Dorrian brings his unique vocals to the album. Scum had mostly hardcore punk-like shouts for vocals. Dorrian does growls and screams instead. Which is another thing that differentiates the genre from hardcore punk. His vocals are in lock-step with the general mayhem of the songs, they match the manic blasts when they come along, and flow along with slower moving riffs.\n\nThe riffs on the album are still very punk-ish. Simple, fast, and extremely catchy. But the speed has been upped a notch. And while there are slower riffs that serve to establish a groove, speed is the norm. Apart from the first track, which has a very leisurely pace, and which is an excellent track as well; all other songs are a whirlwind of monstrous riffage and chaotic blast-beating, augmented by the very socially informed, yet completely unintelligible vocals. Also, another brilliant quality of the riffs is that when they change, they are variations on the former riff most of the time. That gives the songs continuity and coherence. Else it would be rather difficult to tell one song from the other since otherwise they mostly consist of blast beats and vocals that are delivered at the speed of those blasts.\n\nThe production is stellar, the cymbals sound divine during the blast sections. The guitar tone absolutely crushes and sounds like a juggernaut that'll mow you down, and Dorrian's voice always manages to be distinct from the rhythm yet complimenting it. There really are no outright bad songs here. Most have recognizable riffs and the vast majority of them are very catchy. Catchiness is a very valuable trait in a genre that mostly relies on creating aural chaos. And this album has catchiness in spades. Songs like Unchallenged Hate, From Enslavement to Obliteration, Social Sterility, Mentally Murdered are grindcore classics and will get stuck in your head when you listen to them.\n\nIf you are a grindcore fan, and you don't have this album, which is pretty fucking unlikely, you should have gotten it yesterday. So don't waste time. However, if you are an extreme metal fan who hasn't yet tried grind out, I'm not sure if this would be a good introduction. Maybe easing yourself in through death metal bands that have grind blasts would be a better approach. But, all said and done, this is a fantastic album and deserves its place in history. And absolutely nothing else sounds like it.\n",
        "\nQuick, what do you get when you combine British Crust Punk (Doom), American Thrashcore (Siege), and old school American Death Metal (Death), some noise, then throw in a dash of Post-Punk a la Killing Joke? You get classic Grindcore, that's what. And one of the earliest examples of Grind, as well.\n\nNow, this is really a compilation of two EP's, as the two halves were recorded at separate times, even with separate line-ups. This is also evident in the sound of the two halves-the first has more variation in tempo, sounds a bit closer to the Crust Punk scene that spawned it, more cohesive songs as a whole, while the second is more along the lines of pure chaos taking the form of the most extreme punk and metal combining. \n\nSomething I love about this (which is true of most Grindcore I listen to) is that its hardcore punk roots are very evident- this has similar riffing and vocal styles to old British Crust Punks, it has the speed and blasting intensity of early American Thrashcore bands- and this also manages to use it's Death metal influence very well, injecting a lot of its atmosphere, while still not letting it overpower the Punk, like many later Grind bands seemed to do. \n\nOf course, historically, this is one of the most important albums in the Grindcore genre, beloved by metalheads and punks allover, as this was one of the earliest real Grindcore albums. Before this, on the metal side, you had Repulsion, and in punk, while you had plenty of precursors to Grind, such as Doom, Electro-Hippies, Siege, and Cryptic Slaughter (though they were metal as well), but Napalm Death really brought it all together-sure, Repulsion had the blasting speed, but they didn't have the Punk attitude and socially aware, political side that Napalm Death brought to the burgeoning genre. This was basically the launching pad for Grindcore, I'd say, and my favorite from Napalm Death.\n\nIf for some reason you don't have this yet, buy/download it as soon as possible, but only if you can respect and enjoy extreme punk as well as extreme metal, though frankly, if you can't, you shouldn't be listening to Grindcore anyways, and in my personal opinion there's gotta be something wrong with you haha\n",
        "\nA lot of jokes have been made about this split album of Napalm Death and Electro Hippies and the absurd lengths of the tracks are certainly worthy to be ridiculed. Yet, to understand the intentions behind this album it is vitally important to look behind the obvious meaning of it all and to put it into the proper framework. \n\nYou suffer\nBut why?\n\nThese are the two short \u2018phrases\u2019 used by the British band Napalm Death for their one short track. In them they refer to a person who suffers, but the actual reasons why this is the case remains hidden. Yet, it is possible to provide some explanation for this and the background of this track. Through this, some light on the intentions behind the split release are shed as well. \n\n1 \u2013 The satisfaction paradigm:\nTo many people in many cultures music is an important part of their way of life. Common sayings such as \"the harmony of the spheres\" [\u2026] point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to (I). So, when you acquire a piece of \u2018audio art\u2019, then you try to enjoy those moments of music, satisfy a desire, dive deep into the motives and the play of the instruments. A listener wants to experience music, be surrounded by the spheres, which appear in the air like magic; you do not understand how the music is created by the artefacts, you are merely able to enjoy the atmosphere created by the mechanical/electronic tools. Yet, as Napalm Death as well as the other band Electro Hippies reduced their compositions to such lows that our ability to understand them is stressed over the limit, the satisfaction, once the \u2018performance\u2019 is over, will not arise. The person is left with this vague feeling of being cheated. It is music, but it appears in a fragmented way and is as such not made for our ears. The time and money that had been spent on this vinyl disk does not meet up the expectations on the side of the listener. You have to remember: it was released in a time in which the Internet was not around and people were not able to share their experiences over a longer distance on a larger (or any) scale. There were publications of course, but how were the chances that someone would have been able to lay hands on the one in which this issue was discussed in a meaningful way; if there actually was any in which it was brought up at all; aside of an advertisement of course? The following should also be kept in mind:\n\nOnly initial copies of \"Grindcrusher - The Earache Sampler\" (catalog# \"MOSH 12\") included this limited edition etched 7\" single (catalog# \"7MOSH 12\"), which was entered into the Guinness Book Of Records as the world's shortest single (II).\n\nIt was (and is) a rare album and collectors might have wanted it. Not only back then, also today it is important to refer to these two tracks on this vinyl disk as an important part of the musical culture, because through the limitation in copies and the small circulation, it is not only hard to lay hands on, but once you have achieved this goal, you have enriched the collection with something that is basically \u2018shit\u2019, something impossible to listen to; left alone to enjoy. The capitalist\u2019 mantra that through consummation satisfaction and identification is created, has received a reversal through this. Just look at the lyrics and everything be comes quite obvious. Moreover, the implications of this and how it affects the black metal scene in particular are also self-evident. \n\n2 \u2013 The lyrics:\nIf you leave the aforementioned aspect aside, then the one of the lyrics and how they are received plays an important role as well. As the track of Napalm Death is the only one with a text in it, a discussion of the performance of the Electro Hippies\u2019 part has to be limited to the title they choose for their composition, but more of this later. \n\nAnyway, another aspect why a person might suffer deals with the lyrics or better how they are/were expressed. Not only due to the extreme shortness of the track it is impossible to understand anything of them, but also because they merge somehow seamlessly with the instruments. The result is one violent burst; the track is even shorter and more extreme in the live performances. It might be argued that the style of the band would prohibit this on a broader scale and a listener would expect the impossibility to understand the text directly in some respect. Even though the validity of this point cannot be doubted, it still misses the point, though. The title \u201cYou Suffer\u201d points towards the listener, attempts to communicate with this person and as such it is only natural what the intention of the lyrics will be; remember those old radio and television commercials and how they attempted to speak directly to the audience. Yet, the mere burst of noise prevents an interaction between these two sides, especially as the mere listening does not reveal the meaning behind the composition. The anticipation of a/the revelation is contradicted by the final result. \n\nThen, if you ignore the issue of understanding the text by \u2018hearing\u2019 it, the aspect of how to interpret the four words is important as well. The words \u201cYou Suffer\u201d might be understood as an imperative, while the second two are nothing but a rhetorical answer to them; maybe even ironic. Further, when you keep in mind how short the track is, the phrase \u201cYou Suffer\u201d becomes somehow hilarious. To even imagine that this statement would bear some reference to or impact on the real world is simply preposterous. \n\n3 \u2013 The titles:\nAs discussed in section 2, the titles of the compositions need some additional attention. Napalm Death\u2019s share has been dealt with above, but there is still the other band: Electro Hippies. Their part, conservatively entitled Mega Armageddon Death Pt.3, might give a neutral person the idea that something really aggressive might have been used for this split album. A blast, something with a real punch \u2026 something brutal and aggressive, something that would reflect this title in one way or another. The actual result is rather wanting \u2013 to call it really euphemistic \u2013, because this band\u2019s share is even shorter then the one of Napalm Death. A single beat, this is what the listener gets and nothing more. Minimalism brought to new levels and the only album I can think of that would be even more extreme is a Silent CD like this one:\nhttp://duramecho.com/Misc/SilentCd/index.html\n\nThe \u201cMega Armageddon Death\u201d is reduced to nothing more than a single and extremely short track. Again, the anticipation created by the title reflects in no way the final result. The gap between these two is enormous and impossible to bridge. Moreover, this composition appears on their first output \u2013 entitled Play Loud or Not At All \u2013 already and had also the additional (Pt. 3) syntax. None of the entries at Electro Hippies\u2019 Discogs site give hints on whether there were ever earlier parts of this track or not; it can be doubted that there are. \n\nWhat makes this track even more absurd is the following:\nIt appeared on several albums before \u2013 for example The Peaceville Recordings (III) \u2013 and even in different lengths. In the version on the aforementioned release it appears in a recording of a live set: played once at the beginning and end with some solo part in the middle. Ridiculous somehow. \n\nTo sum the impressions up:\nThis is not a serious release, even though some might describe it as such. It is rather a bizarre example of what music has become in the modern ages. You do not need complex rhythms anymore, you do not need loads of arrangements and sometimes the music can have the length of a blink of an eye. Whether or not it is possible to measure the quality of this piece of art by normal standards is a different question and was not the idea behind this review. Nevertheless, the split album between Napalm Death and Electro Hippies marks an extreme not only in the metal but in the music scene in general. The chances to see or hear a shorter release any time soon are next to zero. As such, this release should be treated as it is:\nA communication with the listener, whose inability to understand the bands in any meaningful way, leaves this person silent. He or she suffers but does not understand the reasons why and is unable to ameliorate the situation in any meaningful way. The death is not of a physical kind, but a mental one, due to the inability to find the proper expressions for the art that said person has just experienced. Suffering and death are both rhetorical, but come with an ironical twist in it.\n\nIt really has something of Monty Python. \n\nI:\nhttps://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Music\nII:\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Various-Grindcrusher-The-Earache-Sampler/release/367419\nIII:\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Electro-Hippies-The-Peaceville-Recordings/release/497223\n\nReleased under:\nCreative Commons Namensnennung-NichtKommerziell-KeineBearbeitung 3.0 Deutschland \n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/de/)\n",
        "\n\"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.\" - Albert Einstein\n\nIf you believe that this quote summarizes everything there is in this release, well, it doesn't. The fact is that this is an interesting split that achieved what it tried to achieve and deserves to be commented by any Napalm Death fan (category in which I am not included) and the only reason to give it a 0 is that there is no point in buying it, owning it or listening to it. If you think for a while you will see that it makes sense: when you review a recording you are supposed to evaluate the quality of the music, so if there is no music at all (if you want to say that three goddamn chords with grindcore vocals in one side and one power chord in the other are actual music go ahead, but nobody will listen to you) the rating should be \"0\" automatically.\n\nThe idea, however, is pretty great. First of all, Napalm Death needed 1,3 second to do what most people will never achieve during a lifetime: they made it to the Guinness Book. Also, they managed to get extra attention from both their fans and the people who have never heard of Napalm Death before, pretending to be \u201ccult\u201d with a song that doesn\u2019t really have any meaning (the rhetorical question asked by the band is not very clear, and can be answered in a lot of ways). Whether this is valid or not is another problem, which shouldn\u2019t be discussed in a review since the morality of a band hardly ever reflect s on their releases, being \u201cMegadeth\u201d the most known and one of the most bizarre examples.\n\nThis release does have a point, but it is pointless to buy it for obvious reasons, unless you can resell it for a decent price. It lacks the very elements that are supposed to be present in music and is impossible to headbang to, while its length makes the act of putting it on not rewarding enough. I doubt that anyone is sufficiently insane to actually enjoy this, so the rating is fair enough.\n",
        "\nI've got to say, this is a little bit disappointing; compared to 'The Code Is Red... Long Live The Code', this might be the smallest change between albums I've ever heard from the band. 'Smear Campaign' is quite literally 'The Code Is Red... Long Live The Code' part two, with Napalm Death's style of sleek, modernized grindcore remaining essentially unchanged from that album. I wanted a bit more from this release- there's nothing bad about it, but it lacks the development between records that I've come to expect from the band.\n\nIf you've heard the previous record, you know what this one sounds like: a very solid fusion of more oldschool, crusty styles of grind and a death-tinged modern variety, with the band swapping between the two styles easily and frequently. Every track includes both d-beats and blast passages, bound together by, in what may be the largest change from the previous album, a colorful sense of dissonant tremolo riffing that seems to be lifted from the best moments of 'Diatribes'. Melodically, 'The Code Is Red... Long Live The Code' was a little bit more conventional than this, where long, held tremolo tones abruptly break down into chunky crust riffing. The instrumental performances are, as always, top notch, and Greenway has never sounded better on the mike, roaring like he hasn't been doing this for decades now.\n\nAnti-Christian sentiment seems to be a prevailing theme on this record with tracks like 'Puritanical Punishment Beating', 'Rabid Wolves (For Christ), and 'Deaf And Dumbstruck (Intelligent Design)' being a notable set of tracks that seem to attack America's newfound appreciation for evangelical Christianity. The fury of previous records isn't absent on this one- Napalm Death sounds, as always, just pissed off to be alive and that drips from every note. The tracks are compact and snappy, with an array of great riffs and savage rhythms that are essentially standard for the band at this point in their career. While I would have appreciated more variation (though the synth-tinged intro and outro definitely add to it), I can't deny that in essence Napalm Death is as strong as ever.\n\nWith Napalm Death's modern style codified, whether you purchase this album or not simply depends on whether you like the band's new sound. If you do, there's no reason to pass this one up: while it might be a bit still at times, 'Smear Campaign' lives up to the band's history even if it doesn't reinvent the wheel. Perhaps on their next album Napalm Death changed it up a bit- I'm eager to hear if they flexed their wings.\n",
        "\n\"Time Waits For No Slave\" is Napalm Death most radical and experimental album since the much-maligned \"Diatribes\" era yet it still retains the overall hellish intensity recently revived since their split with Earache Records. Songs like 'Strongarm' and 'Diktat' could level a city if played loudly enough, while 'Fallacy Dominion' and the title track remind us that Napalm isn't afraid to stretch outside the boundaries of the death-grind genre they helped start. Not being easily pigeonholed has always been one of ND's greatest strengths and they play to it impressively here, capitalizing on the good will created from their post-Earache run to engage in all sorts musical trickery: lots of dissonance layered under clean vocals, clean guitar tones and solos, and some odd-time shifts and signatures; it's a laundry-list to scare away the staunchest grind mavens but Napalm Death pulls off the hat-trick of successfully incorporating these elements into their usual harsh framework of blast beats, d-beats, and hardcore breakdowns. These songs, for the most part, crush all. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, 'Strongarm' is like a nuclear bomb detonating at the start. 'Downbeat Clique' contains the sickest crossover riff I've ever heard on an ND record. Ditto the breakdowns on 'De-evolution Ad Nauseum,' a song that could easily bring the house down live. 'Work To Rule' opens with a nice, wide-open, ringing guitar tone then lots of harmonic breaks and ill tempo changes. 'Larceny Of The Heart' could easily have appeared on \"Diatribes,\" that is until the sick grind bits kick in. If anything, ND is re-imagining their earlier, experimental era, adding textures without losing the extremity.\n\nIf anything is holding this album back from being an all-time ND classic, it is the production. Something that I've suspected for awhile is plainly evident here -- Barney's voice is double-tracked, and this prominent in the mix, it sounds odd. On \"Smear Campaign,\" his voice was more buried and the double-tracking less evident. He also sounds a bit tired, much rougher around the edges and lacking the power he so easily conveyed in his prime. In concert, he seems to do fine so fault seems to be entirely with the production and not the voice itself. Meanwhile, the guitar tone is way more compressed than usual and the drums are set slightly back in the mix. Both of these decisions detract from the overall heaviness of the record. This is the first time since their comeback where I didn't think that the band sounded heavier than they did previously.\n\nNote: some editions come with bonus tracks (either 'Suppressed Hunger', 'Omnipresent Knife In The Back' or 'We Hunt In Packs'), as usual these tracks are worth hunting down, particularly 'We Hunt In Packs,' a song so strong it should have made the main album.\n",
        "\nAh, notoriety. How often does it happen that a release utterly undeserving of anybody\u2019s time and attention is thrust into the limelight, to be reviled by most (and often lauded by a few), when it would have been better that it languished in obscurity? Too often, I suspect\u2014 it is far from a rare occurrence to see a release garner unwarranted discussion and review, simply due to its background, its artist, or some other notable feature that has somehow ensnared people\u2019s attention. It seems to be a part of human nature to fixate on things for the strangest reasons. This review is an example of this behavioural oddity; in fact, the 1300-odd words devoted to this curious little release is really far more than is deserved! A far more appropriate and succinct summary would be \u201cIt\u2019s shit; why bother?\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, in the name of the sunk-cost fallacy I shall forge ahead. This release has become somehow noteworthy due to its record-breaking nature, but ultimately there is no point in listening to it. Napalm Death and Electro Hippies each contribute one extremely short track, resulting in a total play time of about two seconds, making it the Shortest Release Ever; it also features the Shortest Song Ever (according to Guinness): You Suffer, by Napalm Death. Accordingly, this little split\u2019s reputation precedes it. But really, it\u2019s not meritorious enough that anybody should ever have even heard of it!\n\nThe first side consists of the aforementioned Napalm Death track, which apparently clocks in at 1.316 seconds. Its record-breaking nature has led to a number of (lengthy) cover versions, and resulted in many live performances of the piece. Now, many will be familiar with this little curio in its original form due to its inclusion on the Scum album, where it rounds off Side A. It has to be said that in this context it\u2019s not half bad. It essentially serves as a little flourish that firmly ends the first half of the album (and the tenure of the line-up that featured on that half!). It can be considered analogous to the endings of so many songs where the music completely stops and then after a second or so a final chord or drum ornament finishes the piece off. It works in exactly the same way, but for a side of an album rather than a piece\u2014however, given the non-stop assault of that album, it actually works extremely well! It\u2019s aggressive and violent and a great bookend.\n\nHowever, taken out of this context, the weaknesses and other traits of the song become apparent. It certainly is a song rather than a burst of noise. It features a good two guitar chords or so, which are played insanely fast and in a blurred manner that would be rather entertaining if not presented in such a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it fashion. The drums are sloppy and chaotic, but that\u2019s essentially perfect for the piece, and for what Napalm Death were doing at the time, and they are definitely playing about a bar\u2019s worth of music rather than just a crash. The vocals come out as a sort of throaty bellow, asking the listener the question, \u201cYou suffer\u2014but why?\u201d. It\u2019s hard to know whether this is profound or just silly (I tend to lean towards the latter), but it certainly carries a message of some sort, and is open to interpretation, to a degree. So, this is certainly a legitimate song, of sorts. Yet it provides none of the satisfaction that should be provided by a decent example of a real song. There\u2019s no progression, no engaging of the listener, no possibility of emotional release. It can\u2019t be treated as a cathartic explosion of noise, since it\u2019s just too damn short to get behind. You can\u2019t mosh to a gunshot for more or less the same reason. Awkward analogies aside, you can\u2019t bang your head to it, and it doesn\u2019t provide any kind of connection to the listener. It\u2019s just so short that without some kind of introduction (such as the first half of Scum) it\u2019s ultimately without impact of its own, and as a result is profoundly alienating. The worst part is that it actually sounds like it would be pretty cool if it were only a little longer. An equally intense and raw explosion of noise that lasted even five or six seconds would be something I could appreciate for itself, and even scream along with, but this takes the aesthetic to such extremes that I want nothing to do with it! Knowing that it was intended as a joke doesn\u2019t make any difference\u2014bad is bad, no matter how you dress it up.\n\nThe Electro Hippies\u2019 side of the split is another extremely short piece called Mega Armageddon Death Pt. 3. This one is similar to Napalm Death\u2019s in terms of length only, but is dramatically different in my mind in one crucial way\u2014I listen to You Suffer like it is a song, but this is nothing more than a burst of noise. It\u2019s just one staccato guitar chord with a drum crash. It doesn\u2019t really provide anything to the listener to analyse or think about. It\u2019s just there. I guess it\u2019s\u2026 a pretty okay chord? It carries unpleasant overtones, something fairly high-pitched that makes it slightly unsettling in its way. A little bit of echo makes it feel quite natural and almost warm, in a cavernous kind of way. But it doesn\u2019t actually go anywhere, which the Napalm Death offering does, in an admittedly stunted kind of way. It somehow manages to engage the listener even less, carries no weight, has no impact. It\u2019s just there, eternal and inscrutable. If I were to judge this as a song I would call it the worst song I had ever heard, carrying no artistic merit whatsoever (that I can feel, at least; these things are so subjective), but as I don\u2019t think of it as a song in the first place it is spared that particular ignominy.\n\nIt is unfair to bash this piece so without providing some kind of context\u2014it\u2019s actually the third in a series. Mega Armageddon Death is a very similar piece\u2014it\u2019s literally just a different chord, presented in the same way! There\u2019s also an extended version floating around somewhere, and a part two, but as I haven\u2019t heard either it\u2019s inappropriate to judge the series as a whole. Still, I can kind of guess what they sound like, and this doesn\u2019t seem like a logical conclusion to a series so much as another bad joke in a series of bad jokes-- and it\u2019s even more unpalatable in its way than Napalm Death\u2019s little peccadillo. Context or not, it is presented on this release without one, and it\u2019s every bit as alienating. It\u2019s not worth the time it takes to listen to it.\n\nTo summarise, the Napalm Death side of this split is utter tripe, but at least it\u2019s an actual song, and one that could be decent if it hadn\u2019t been pushed to such extremes. The Electro Hippies half doesn\u2019t even have that going for it\u2014it\u2019s a non-song, a nothing. Despite the distinctions surrounding this release, it is almost without merit of its own, not worth listening to, and certainly not worth writing about. It should sink into obscurity forever, but this is unlikely to happen\u2014as I said right at the start, human nature is a funny thing. The only saving grace is that it was available free with another release! This is not something that anybody but the most dedicated collector should shell out for, listen to, or otherwise pay any heed to. The irony of saying this in a review that I actually had to sit down and write is not lost on me, but let the reader rest assured that I regret every second it took.\n",
        "\nOh man, here we go: the oldschool logo and collage-style artwork returns along with an updated version of the sound from albums like 'Harmony Corruption'. This is the start of Napalm Death fourth and current musical phase: their breed of modernized but still brutal death/grind without the experimental waffling or hardcore leanings of the last phase. That had its moments, but most fans (and probably the band themselves) wanted a return to a more traditional Napalm Death sound defined by blasts and screaming rather than funk drumming and spoken word interludes.\n\nMusically this is very similar to albums like 'The Code Is Red... Long Live The Code'. Roots in albums like 'Utopia Banished' are clear, but this is most certainly a slicker, modernized version of that sound firmly located in the realms of modern death/grind. While the punk edge of material has not been entirely lost, it's been synthesized into the greater death/grind whole and generally appears in more obvious forms as a burst of thrashy riffing here and there or some scattered d-beats. The core of the riffing is entrenched in modern death and grind ala Nasum, though certainly with the rhythmic edge that Napalm Death has so powerfully cultivated throughout their career.\n\nWhile 'Enemy Of The Music Business' isn't really anyone's favorite Napalm Death album, it's amazingly consistent, particularly coming off the heels of the last era, and has more than a few tracks which are second-tier Napalm Death classics. 'Vermin', 'Thanks For Nothing', 'Cure For The Common Complaint', and 'Necessary Evil' (the last of which is the first Napalm Death song I ever heard) are all powerful slabs of death/grind, and the others are really no weaker. The remarkably powerful production and guitar tone contribute to the overall crushing quality of the record; it's definitely a step up from the slightly flat and dry sound of previous releases and is probably the best the band had up to this point in their career.\n\nMoreover, this is just such an excruciatingly angry album; the overall theme of corporate hatred comes through very clearly. Greenway sounds about ready to murder someone on tracks like 'Thanks For Nothing', and the other musicians are right behind him in aggression. This is a good summation of the album: while it's not saying anything new, it's saying those typical things in a remarkably intense and effective manner. Recommended for death/grind fans and Napalm Death devotees in particular.\n",
        "\nI've been a non-stop Napalm Death fan since the early 90's, defending and enjoying even their most mediocre work. And while they've never really released a flat-out bad album, there certainly were several middle of the road ones towards the end of the last decade. By 1999, I'd pretty much lost hope. ND seemed a band who could still write great songs but couldn't really string a whole album together. That coupled with their acrimonious split from Earache and Barney's tenative status in the band led me to believe they were finished as a unit.\n\nI couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nWhen \"Enemy Of The Music Business\" was initially released, I was skeptical but being the loyal die-hard I am, I quickly plunked out for the CD and set it in the player with minimal expectations. \"Taste The Poison\" proceeded to rip my face off. As did each successive track after it. Note for note, song for song, there wasn't a single piece of filler. Every song was concise, well-written and strongly executed. The production was razor-sharp and well-balanced with the guitars way up in the mix.\n\nWhen it was over, I was exhausted and excited. Here was the Napalm Death I'd always known and loved and hoped to have back again. A band ferociously, righteously angry with a huge chip on their shoulder and something to prove. Nothing could be more creatively exciting, especially for a band that's been around for awhile, a band who felt their credibility falter and slip on the precipice of irrelevance. \n\nEOTMB brought Napalm Death all the way back. It was harder, faster, louder, and angrier than anything I'd ever heard before. Here Barney unleashes his greatest fury: grunting, screaming, and yelling like a scalded, rabid, speared baboon whose gonna pull that spear through his own belly just to take another swing at you. Mitch Harris's shrieks also hit new peaks of intensity, adding another insane element to the sound. Hell, \"Taste The Poison\" sounds like pure, unfettered chaos, straining the constraint of a song to its very limit, pushing the sound to near white noise. \"Next On The List\" is brutal death metal. A song that easily could've appeared on either \"Harmony Corruption\" or \"Utopia Banished.\" Danny Herrara really pushes his abilities here. This is the most concise pedal work I've heard from him. From there on it is all pure grind madness: \"C.S., pt 2,\" \"Vermin,\" \"Constitutional Hell,\" \"Cure For The Common Complaint\" -- these songs are an almost perfect blend of F.E.T.O. era grind and modern ND death metal. They demonstrate a reinvigorated band picking up the gauntlet thrown down by bands like Nasum, Rotten Sound, and Pig Destroyer, all of whom had been nipping at ND's heels for awhile. EOTMB set Napalm Death back on their grind throne.\n",
        "\nThe mid-90's is a much maligned era for Napalm Death with most of the criticism well justified. Albums like \"Diatribes,\" \"Inside The Torn Apart,\" and \"Words From The Exit Wound\" featured some stand-out material but were also weighted down by plodding, repetitive mid-paced numbers and some misguided experimentation. That said, however, there are some gems from that era and this EP is one of them.\n\n\"Greed Killing\" leads off with three-minutes of intense, neck-snappingly heavy metal. In 1995, this song was a breath of fresh air for the band, an intriguing attempt at incorporating traditional song structures into their grind template. The chorus is sickeningly heavy with a hook strong enough to hang a cadaver on. Had they written more songs of this caliber, as compared to the utterly wretched \"Self Betrayal,\" this era would be more fondly remembered. That song, a half-assed attempt at a Swans-like dirge, just doesn't come together at all, sounding more like a discarded jam than a song.\n\n\"My Own Worst Enemy\" and \"Finer Truths, White Lies\" are both mid-paced affairs, enjoyable but not exceptional, they are more reminiscent of the filler that bogged down the albums of this period. Whereas on a full-length these songs would just blend in and be forgotten, here they are given enough room to settle in and make a decent impression. Both tracks feature groove oriented riffage with funky syncopated drum beats. \"My Own Worst Enemy\" falters along simplistic lines, the body of the song has some meaty riffs and hooks but the chorus falls flat, collapsing the song slightly. That track made the album whereas \"Finer Truth, White Lies\" did not. Would it were the other way around as \"FTWL\" features a deep, heavy groove that just invites a huge pit breaking out.\n\nAs for the other tracks, \"Antibody\" and \"All Links Severed\" deliver a classic dose of ND goodness. These songs blast through with the grinding death metal we all wish had been more prevalent on the albums of this era.\n\nOverall, this is a diverse and enjoyable short program of songs. The production is crisp and punchy, though the guitars sound a little flat and low in the mix. Barney's voice, however, sounds snarlingly strong and vicious, probably the best he's ever sounded on record.\n\nNote that there is a bonus, live track from 1994 on some editions. It's terrible, sounding like congealed mud, and ought to have been omitted.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the now considered classic \"From Enslavement to Obliteration\", Napalm Death definitely showed a new style in music in which they obviously were so influenced by the rising Floridian death metal scene that they released \"Harmony Corruption\". Ditto on that one too. By that time Napalm Death were not only progressing as a band but starting to show that they can hang with the big boys in terms of spear-heading the extreme metal wave of the 90's and rightfully so. But along the way Napalm Death started to receive flak from their original fan base which consisted of mainly crust punks and hardcore punks that were fans of their original grind core sound. Unflinching from the flak, Napalm Death said to hell with those cries and went back in the following year and released a compilation called \"Death By Manipulation\" which showed an even more Floridian death metal influence than before, which sadly was whirlwind drummer Mick Harris's last output with the band due to musical differences and stress from the road. Napalm Death kept pushing forward and with their fourth album \"Utopia Banished\", they had started to show their weary eyes for all to see.\n\n\"Utopia Banished\" is without a doubt faster and most extreme version of what \"Harmony Corruption\" could have been, but instead they took one step forward and two steps back. The album is a total of 15 songs of pure death metal-influenced grind core in the fact that it's more extreme than death metal, but too well-produced and too well-played for most grind core bands to even attempt at playing. If you can imagine a hundred Tasmanian devils running around in a whirlwind of destroying everything in it's path, it does just that, but it does so in an unfocused way that the band threads on water that keeps it from reaching a certain level of kill ratio. The sound production is obviously much more clearer than on \"Harmony Corruption\" which was too bassy and thick. Here Napalm Death show a sound production that would actually be perfected with their next album \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\". It's a distorted, static-like fuzziness that gives the album a more industrial overtone much like \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\" but not as depressing or bleak sounding. \n\nMajority of the songs presented on \"Utopia Banished\" are sadly filler. I mean, a lot of them run back-to-back at a speed to where it blurs to the point of stupidity. Songs like \"Idiosyncratic\", \"Aryanisms\", \"Judicial Slime\", \"Upward and Uninterested\" just sound like one long grind fest. I am not doubting these songs and calling them bad or horrible by any means, I mean some of the riffs are great and seeing how far the brummies have progressed is great, but it's too many ideas being thrown around and too fast for the sake of speed and extremeness. Then there are songs which by themselves have their own identities and completely stand-out amongst the blast beats and growls; \"Discordance\" opens the album up with nothing but noise, pulsing distorted arpeggios and industrial-like samples which reminds us how dark the world can really be at times. \"I Abstain\" is a song that has more tempo changes and drum rolls than the entire album put together. \"Dementia Access\" has a scream that still commands me to completely wreck everything around me. \"The World Keeps Turning\" is the single from the album and it's great. Nothing but hardcore-like thrashing skank beats mixed in with grind core blast beats and some serious death metal overtones. \"Cause And Effect (Part II)\" is one of the better examples of death metal-influenced grind core. \"Distorting The Medium\" has one of the better stat/stop intros and is a breath of fresh air amongst the filler songs surrounding it. \"Got Time To Kill\" could have been \"Dementia Access\" part 2 for the most part with guitarist Mitch Harris' insane shrieks. \"Awake(To A Life of Misery)\" is total double-bass and blast beats and then what is probably the best song on the entire album is \"Contemptuous\". With samples from the movie \"Full Metal Jacket\", the song is total Godflesh/Swans worship and is an extremely agitated doom and dread-filled song. The lyrics is five or so lines that perfectly sums up how depressing life can be at times; \"Sadness, despair/Sometimes the things I cherish, sometimes that all I've got/And that's enough/Bitterness, anger/Man made torture, not to be shared.\"\n\nIt's obvious the album is the source of great and well thought-out lyrics that put things into perspective. Vocalist Barney Greenway and bassist Shane Embury's lyrics should be the best reason to own any Napalm Death album as a way of showing the more intelligent side of such hellish noise. The album's artwork done by Napalm Death's long-time friend Mid, also helps the album put it's venting, and cathartic release of anger to a certain level where it more than just mere noise. Again a simple outcry of all that is hypocritical and downright stupid and unnecessary in this world. If I had to point someone in the right direction to listening to Napalm Death for the very first time, I would start with \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\" for obvious reasons. \"Utopia Banished\" is like a an athlete in his prime running a marathon as fat as humanly possible, but doesn't hold as much excitement as the other releases. I would only recommend this release to people who are just starting to get used to ND's blinding sonic terror.\n",
        "\nProof positive that getting older does not necessarily mean slowing down, Napalm Death offers their latest in a string of hi-octane records dating back to the turn of the century's Enemy of the Music Business. While some of these albums like Smear Campaign have been hard hitting and fairy ass kicking, this new album is probably the best I've heard from them since the late 80s/early 90s. It successfully captures their roots, that brutal punk which was partially responsible for launching the grind genre and thus a gazillion other bands. And at the same time, it embraces their death metal transition and a crisp, vibrant studio production.\n\nThe idea here is to finish you off as quickly as possible with \"Strongarm\", an aggressive grinder with mixture of Barney grunts, snarls and brutal gang shouts. If you've lived on, you are met with \"Diktat\" and its grooving hyper death riffing which explodes into a gorgeous flow of grind and vocal battery. \"Work to Rule\" shifts harmonic breaks into pummeling blast beats, and then two tempos of great breakdowns. \"On the Brink of Extinction\" starts with one of the best thrash riffs I've heard all year, and it's one of the best songs here! The title track is complex and well constructed, with some dissonant but melodic riffing amidst the punches and kicks. Okay I'm five tracks into this description and let me just say there are nine more to go, and you will be disappointed with exactly NONE of them.\n\nTime Waits for No Slave is Napalm Death on the top of their game, and I haven't enjoyed one of their records this much since Harmony Corruption, which was quite a different beast at the time. This is not only a pleasant surprise, but the death/grind album to beat in the coming year! Not only a forceful display of energy and experience, but an album of some depth and diversity in the songwriting.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nNapalm Death's fifth demo from 1985 was an important recording for Napalm Death being the last of their punk recordings and the first showing the bands transition into more extreme music. The demo has recieved much appreciation since its release and is one of the few Napalm Death demos available still today.\n\nThe original cover of the demo seems to be long gone at least from the almighty internet but the cover of the bootleg version in my opinion looks very nice. It really shows you what the demo is all about and what the band was like at that time. A black and white photocopied picture and bearly literable text done with a marker really just glow of the D.I.Y. mentality! \n\nThe production on this demo in my opinion is just amazing. It's just so incredibly raw yet with every aspect of the band in perfect balance! There's some background noise/static present but I find that it actually gives to the recording, giving it a very gloomy and notorius feel to it. The guitar sounds a bit like a chainsaw, reminds me of the japanese band Confuse. Even though heavily distorted and smutty you can make out every riff. The drums also sound decent even though the snare drum really is the most audible of the set. There's not much to say about the bass guitar sounds, but theyre there and do what they're supposed to do.\n\nThe demo starts out with the song: \"What man can do\". As soon as I hear the gloomy guitar riff and the tom-tom led drum loops I'm immediately reminded of early Amebix. This influence can be heard throughout the demo, as most of the songs are pretty much anarcho crust with thrash/death metal influence. If I wasn't so sure this is not the case, I could swear I hear some second wave black metal here too at times. None of the songs seem repetitive but still sound like they belong on the same recording. To me, control (also heard on the full length: Scum) is the best song on this demo. I might even go as far as saying it's a better song played like it was punk rather than grindcore.\n\nThis demo in my view really was quite important in Napalm Death's career. Not only because it's ice cream to my ears but because it shows the development of Napalm Death's music from anarcho punk to old school crust and finally to grindcore. All in all one of the best recordings of Napalm Death ever.\n",
        "\nI'd be very suprised if there was anyone on metal archives who hasn't heard of the legendary Napalm Death, who pioneered/helped pioneer almost everything that is used currently in extreme metal, as well as arguably being the one of the first extreme metal bands, next to bands like Death and Repulsion. They pioneered the use of blast beats, the use of deeper, angrier death growls, the mixture of high shreiks/low growls, as well as helping establish the now overpopulated death metal scene.\n\nMost people probably remember ND as a grindcore/death metal band with albums like \"Harmony Corruption\" and \"Utopia Banished\", and thus, this section of Napalm Death's history (this album and FED) is forgotten or hated. The reason probably being that the grindcore elements you may remember this band for are completley gone. This is more industrial/death metal/groove metal. On paper it sounds stupid, but it's actually a great record, despite the hatred it receives.\n\nThe opening track, \"Greed Killing\" is by far the most entertaining track on the album. In fact, of all the ND albums I've heard, this particular song is by far the most memorable and coolest. 50 of the points I gave this album go to this song. Unfortunatly, immediatly after that song the album goes downhill, and by \"Dogma\" you'll want to turn it off. However, all these songs are good, but they get very boring after awhile as the riffage is very bland and uninteresting. The songs are often very forgettable, and although there are a handful of standout tracks, all are ruined at some point in time exept for \"Greed Killing\", which is the only truly amazing song.\n\nSo, Napalm Death's \"Diatribes\" is fairly impressive, although it's definatly not the album I would recommend to get one into this classic band. If you're on here though, you probably already at least own \"Scum\", so I suppose this is more of a filler album for the big fan than an album I would ever personally purchase. But hey, I got this and Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\", buy one get one free for 7.88. Pretty good deal, I think so. \n\n7.2/10- Just buy the \"Greed Killing\" ep and avoid this unless you're really interested in hearing Napalm Death experimenting with a completly new sound.\n",
        "\nIt's quite difficult to believe that this band has been around since 1982. They started as a punk rock band, which then became extreme grindcore and now are currently playing grindcore/death metal. This newer sound fits the band better. They've also gone through several lineup changes since their origin. On this new release, they feature Mark \"Barney\" Greenway on vocals, Mitch Harris on guitars/vocals, Shane Embury on bass/vocals and Danny Herrera on drums. \n\nThe time signatures (tempos) on the music are all over the place. Some tracks start out with a groove style on guitars. Then, there are riffs that are heavily tremolo picked. In addition, a harmonic riff is also exhibited. Also, on some tracks there are a few cliche type of rhythms. However, some guitar riffs are very unique and catchy. There is only one guitar solo on this entire album. They really should've kept it out because Mitch does a better job on rhythm only. He did the writing on the bulk of the compositions. Shane wrote some of songs too though. There are 14 tracks which clocks in at almost 51 minutes in length.\n\nFor the overall sound, each instrument/vocals you can hear very clearly. Everything was mixed well. The guitar is thick, the drums blasting, the vocal outputs are mostly hoarse though some are screams and also some very little clean voice. The playing here shows that this band still has talent. They have not slacked off at all. They still know how to create intense/extreme music. Their age haven't gotten in the way of that whatsoever. They're still putting out quality material.\n\nThe lyrics feature topics such as political unrest, hate, aggression, and social issues. \"Barney\" wrote most of the songs. Though Shane wrote a couple and Mitch on one track. The lyrical content is rather interesting. They're not about death, dying, gore or anything else that's mindless. These words are actually intelligent. There is much admiration that I have for the songs. There are no covers on this album at all. All of the tracks are brand new.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Time Waits For No Slave\" is one hell of a solid release. Not every track was entirely innovative though. As I mentioned previously, there were some guitar riffs that were a bit cliche. But overall, Napalm Death composed some new awesome songs. 'Harmony Corruption' remains to be my favorite release of theirs however. If you're into grindcore/death metal, then do yourself a favor and pick this release up!\n",
        "\nLong overdue a review in these here parts is Napalm Death's 'difficult' 14th album, \"Time Waits For No Slave\", another cannon in the arsenal of a truly remarkable and groundbreaking career. Repeating their story is pointless, and anyway, it would take much too long for a review, but do check out Albert Mudrian's \"Choosing Death: The Improbable History Of Death Metal And Grindcore\" if you come away from this review with an interest in this area of the musical world - it's an excellent and informative read.\n\nDespite being one of the first truly extreme bands I heard when back in 2002 I somehow acquired a promo copy of the-then newly released \"Order Of The Leech\" LP, Napalm have never piqued my interest. Probably through a combination of a general disinterest in grind (though Napalm have been far more than that since about 1990) and the right moment never having come along, I find myself viewing \"Time...\" in the same level of interest: having had a few listens I feel I've hit the glass ceiling of appreciation towards this album. With 14 songs in 50 minutes it clearly doesn't conform to grind's one-song-per-minute stereotype but that number of songs does begin to grate after a bit when all are in the mid length category and, with a few exceptions, the tone and sound is similar throughout.\n\nThankfully it is always obvious whom it is when you hear Napalm blasting out of a stereo - the radioactive guitar sound of Mitch Harris and Barney Greenway's exceptional half-growl/half-bark sitting atop a perfect melting pot of Discharge/GBH inspired crust/punk and extreme metal is only going to mean one thing. Barney's highly thoughtful lyrics concerning politics, capitalism, environmentalism and other topics are always an endearing factor towards Napalm if you ask me (numerous interviews have proven Barney to be a respectable, intelligent man deserving of his opportunity to air personal opinions) and in respect to older records, Barney is more intelligible at times here too. In the musical department, the speed can be described as what would have been 'fast' in the mid-80s; read as blastbeats and speedy crust punk riffs without the overly triggered and unnatural drums that would be the definition of 'fast' today. Highlights include the punkiest of the lot, \"Work To Rule\", the grindiest of the lot, a Kreator-esque \"Feeling Redundant\", and opener \"Strongarm\", whose forthright directness matches the title of the song. However dismissing the eleven other songs would be a fallacy as the consistency throughout is a signifier of a band who have been round the block more than a few times in their career.\n\nAt this point in their career, an unimaginable 27 years after the earliest line-up was created Napalm Death are never going to get any bigger or more respected but for a band of such experience their commitment to blasting out with such a real intent is admirable and a lesson to anyone with a passion for an extreme craft. A commendably solid, if unspectacular, release from these legends of the scene.\n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net.\n",
        "\nWith the release of the massively influential \u201cScum\u201d in 1987, Napalm Death established themselves as the premier grindcore band of the world. They had been generating a buzz for five years prior to its release and had even garnered some popularity and radio airplay. Despite this success, Napalm Death suffered from constantly changing lineups. \u201cScum\u201d was an excellent album, but the fact that it was split across two entirely different groups of people produced somewhat of an unstable effect. \u201cFrom Enslavement To Obliteration\u201d fixed this problem by having a stable (for the time being) lineup. \n\nFOTE is an altogether different monster, but more importantly it is a monster that manages to keep itself intact across 22 songs. While some may argue that the Napalm Death of the Bullen/Broadrick days was the best, it is insanely difficult to compare them to the growling and shrieking of Lee Dorrian, and blitzkrieg speed of guitarist Bill Steer, drummer Mick Harris, and bassist Shane Embury. While most of these talents were introduced during the second half of \u201cScum\u201d, it is on FOTE where they consolidate and take on an identity of their own. \n\nThe album begins with the very slow and ominous \u201cEvolved As One.\u201d Distorted guitars and extremely creepy vocals give way to the utter mayhem that is \u201cIt\u2019s A M.A.N.S. World.\u201d That song is the starting point for where the early Napalm Death formula is pushed to the absolute limit. It\u2019s all here, from the catchy punk-infested grind riffs to Dorrian\u2019s demented vocals and Harris\u2019s insane drumming. While Napalm Death had been using this same formula for a while, it is here where it is done best. Just listen to the non-stop barrages that are \u201cLucid Fairytale\u201d and \u201cImpressions\u201d, or headbang to the more varied, but no less brutal, tunes of \u201cDisplay To Me\u201d and \u201cMentally Murdered.\u201d This is essential Napalm Death, and also their last true grindcore album. Indeed, after FOTE both Dorrian and Steer would leave and be replaced with Mitch Harris and Barney Greenway, both great musicians in their own right, but lacking the sheer explosiveness that made Napalm Death into such a powerhouse.\n\n\u201cFrom Enslavement To Obliteration\u201d is an album who may not have the historical value of the band\u2019s previous works, but instead has something that is perhaps more important; perfection of the formula that gave the band a name in the first place.\n",
        "\n\"Inside The Torn Apart\" is the album that many people don't even know exist. Or they do know exist but don't acknowledge that much because it was one of the albums that show Napalm Death trying and managing to rebound after the lazy \"Diatribes\" and even the somewhat messy divorce of mainman Barney Greenway from the rest of the tribe. Even the band photo on the back of the album you can tell the level of being completely burnt-out and lack of enthusiasm for their own future and eachother is easily shown in their eyes. But for typical band drama, Napalm Death managed to pull through the bickering and bullshit aside and make a damn better than that knocks \"Diatribes\" out of the water and next \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\" is easily the best representation of their progressive era where they were trying to not make the same ol' Grind-Influenced Death Metal/Death Metal-influenced Grind/whathaveyou.\n\nFor one the riffs are back and now they have a sense of direction. One of the main thing that was lacking in the previous album was riffs. Not only are they back with direction, but are more well-constructed and the tunings are much more clearer in that you know they are more focused and not fucking around with TRYING to experiment but just doing what the feel and not having it come out all forced and muck-filled. Half of the album's songs(depends on which one is your favorite) is written either by bassist Shane Embury, or the Jesse Pintado/Mitch Harris camp. It seems like we know who's stepping away from the progression and writing straight-forward traditional ND songs which is obviously Shane you have to give big boy his credit seeing how he took on a lot of the music arrangements and lyrical duties in order to try to make this a better album. And he did. Not to bad-mouth Jesse and Mitch but Embury did write lyrics for 8 out of 12 songs and jammed-out 5 of those songs kinda showing us that Jesse and Mitch are trying to catch-up with the song turn-out rate. Lyrically there is even less social-political and more personal which is the main theme. It's not whiny either. Shane makes it clear you can go through drama, conflict, stress, and other crap without being so melodramatic. I wish more bands would do the same. Danny's drums are still snappy and are more well-timed with the guitars. In fact the album seems less rythmic and more drum-melody driven. Vocally, Barney is sounding a lot better. It's almost as if there wasn't that split, he would not have gotten his second wind. His performance and low-end 'umph' is back and more clear. He doesn't sound muddy or tired, he just sounds like he's finding that extra something in the bottom of his gut. Bottom line is that almost everything on here sounds like they looked at \"Diatribes\" and re-wrote a lot of the riffs so that it would better match everything. I mean listen to the main melodies of both \"Greed Killing\" and \"Breed To Breath\" and tell me the tempo, pacing, and even pre-chrorus breakdown sound damn-near identical.\n\nAside from the above mentioned, I might go on the record and say that this is probably the only good album that came out in 1997. I mean correct me if I am wrong, but outside of the Grindcore/Death metal genre...what else was released that year that was any good? Pretty much nothing. Remember this was released the year Death Metal was considered dead for the most part. Outside of Brutal Truth and Suffocation everyone else just sucked for the most part? It goes without saying that Napalm Death managed to put put out a very energetic and better charging album admist all of the stress going on internally and externally. \n\nBest songs on here...oh there is quite a handful; \"Breed To Breath\", \"Reflect On Conflict\" is a riff-or-rama which will be stuck in your head for days, \"Down in the Zero\" which has a catchy melodic chorus \"Inside The Torn Apart\" slows things down to a NYHC melodic crunch which has Shane angrily singing, \"If Symptoms Persist\"(best song title) has some of the best reversed riffs next to Metallica's \"Eye of The Beholder\", \"Prelude\" sounds like \"Relfect On Conflict\" prt. 2 continued only faster, and possibly the best song and my personal favorite the blast-beat ridden \"Lowpoint\" which resembles \"Throwaway\" from \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\". Why the brummies don't play \"Lowpoint\" live is a fucking mystery, because through-out the entire album you are waiting for that devastating ramming-speed grind that only ND can bring about and then when the song kicks in with the churning opening riffs you KNOW they are about to bring it on(can't believe I used that phrase while reviwing a ND album, but I guess it's better than saying \"it's da bomb!\"...oh well)...but fuck they rage like only ND can rage. Pretty soon you'll be screaming out \"LOWPOOOIINNNTTT!!!\" right along with Barney.\n\nIf you are suffering like the band from the frustration-induced fatigueness of \"Diatribes\", you can easily be cured with \"Inside The Torn Apart.\"\n",
        "\nBoy you KNOW that Napalm Death were thinking of something other than the music with the artwork being mainly an annoying neon green color....of maybe it was just Dig at Earache pressuring them, who the fuck knows, personally it's migrane-inducing.\n\nNapalm Death's previous album \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\" was an all-time high as far as creativity and progression went, but \"Diatribes\" is where they hit their brakes and really just turned the tv off and were left wondering \"How do we progress, evolve further?\" More groove, less blastbeats, less cryptic lyrics, less socio-polticial lyrics and more mild-mannered song-structures leaving the listener feel a bit cheated.\n\n\"Diatribes\" production is too clean almost. Complete contrasting their last album where they really brought in a dirty industrial overtone, \"Diatribes\" seems like a bad making-up for what they originally wanted with \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair.\" Colin Richardson really fucking neuters the band on this album and the band themselves seem completely lethargic and out-of-tune as far as the direction of the riffs.\n\nThere are some good songs, but it's only for the first quarter of the album while the rest are scattered in sections and bridges and choruses and versus and just about everything. \"Greed Killing\" is catchy as fuck. Not doubting that song. This is probably the closest thing ND will EVER come to writing something that is melodic, catchy, and has the potential of being in the Top 200....\"Glimpse Into Genocide\", yeah a glimpse into a mass genocide of the music for the rest of the album because at somepoint between \"Rip For The Breaking\" (One of the more faster songs on here) and \"Cold Forgiveness\"(Swans/Godflesh-worship) they hit their lowest point ever. \n\n\"Cursed To Crawl\"\n\nLowest point meaning it's not needed. I enjoy the song. I seriously do. It doesn't sound Rap-Metal/Nu-Metal/whatever the fuck some of these pretentious so-called Metal fan drama queens would have you believe, in fact it sounds a lot like some other killer 90's Hardcore bands like 1992-circa Sick Of It All or old-school Snapcase because for the most part it's a giant breakdown but done with taste. And groovy. I enjoy it, and if it had been by some other band I would give them praise, but not the brummies. Thankfully they never attemtped to do this again.\n\nOther than that....maybe some points of the last two songs \"Placate, Sedate, Eradicate\", and \"Corrosive Elements\" the songs make you go \"Huh?\" just all the fucking way through. To the point of frustration. Barney is really suffering here with vocal performance. Mitch and Jesse....were you guys listening to too much Machine Head? Shane's lyrics and Danny's drumming are the only redeeming qualities here. And for all that you can still somewhat call it a decent album, just not their best one.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death are without the Grindcore kings, gods, innovators, etc. Whatever title you can give them they've earned it from being one of the handful of bands to give birth to the noisy bastard offspring of Hardcore-Punk, Thrash/Death Metal, with the depressive overtones of Industrial's bleakness. And honestly, it couldn't have come from a more depressing fucking city like Birmingham. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that if you live in a constant state of dismal post-WWII factory working-class structures, you're going to have a little bit of anger and frustration. Just ask Black Sabbath.\n\nAfter \"Utopia Banished\", it's easy to see ND threading waters with their music. Sure songs like \"The World Keeps Turning\", \"Dementia Access\", \"Contemptuous\", and \"I Abstain\" were stand-outs and well-written slabs of early 90's DM with Grind influences that you can still rock the fuck out to this day, but let's be honest, the majority of that album was just a lot of ideas thrown in the mix for trying to be another attempt at trying to out-extreme music for extreme music's sake. It's like poking a dead dog with a stick. It's fun, enjoyable, but maybe every once in a while you should use a broom handle, garden hoe, or a 72 foot dildo(com'n...THAT's funny!)...point being you have to switch things up from the traditional way of doing things in order to throw a bit of spice into life. And that's what Napalm Death does with \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair.\"\n\nFirst thing one notices is the sound production. Right from the get go, this is more akin to their first 3 albums where it was good but it still had ND's crusty punk roots all-over it. It's a layer of distorted white noise soot covering the background being covered in the grime from jumping into a huge pile of charcoal. And just the right layer too. It's not too overdone and it's not too thin, but again it enhances the dirtiness of the music. Pretty music this aint. Also the music has changed a lot. The blastbeats are still there, the socio-political lyrics are there, everything trademarked by ND is still there, but they've slowed down a bit in order to focus more on riffs which was somewhat missing from the last album. If \"Utopia Banished\" was all about speed, this album is definately more based on groove, lots of mid-tempo, and slightly more technical riffs that flow even better and don't sound forced.\n\nLyrically ND has started to expand as well. The lyrics have become slightly more cryptic, meaning you get the hint at what the are saying and you can still relate to the levels of frustration and general depression this album holds, but seeing how vocalist Barney Greenway and bassist Shane Embury are fluent in the art of world salad, I'd be surprised to see how it take you to pinpoint the main topic of some of the songs. Not all of them, most of them are somewhat obvious, but again when I first read the lyrics I personally was a bit stumped, but in a good way. Meaning that they can vividly describe the negativity surrounding them without having to result to a basic 5th grader vocabulary. It's best described as a world where only black and white are mainstayers and only a few shades of grey are hints of clairty amongst the murkiness of the music.\n\nOn the flipside of all the praise I give this album (It's in my Top 10 all-time favorites), there is also a lot of doubt and back-lash surrounding this album. Mainly because Napalm Death were the attempt at trying to be the next Metallica by Earache owner Dig by signing them to Columbia records alongside Entombed, Godflesh, Cathedral, Carcass, etc. This album was supposed to be their big breakthrough into the mainstream and they got a lot of flak from not only fans and critics alike, but internally as well. Vocalist Barney Greenway has often expressed how he was dissatisifed with the recording proccess which he often refers to as one of the worst nightmares he's ever had due to the fact that is vocal chords were dried-out and swelling because he claims the studio was \"hot\" or too warm which you can easily hear in his performance on such songs as \"Twist The Knife (Slowly)\". Also he didn't like the way the songs turned out because of the newer influences the other members were soaking in at the time mainly Alternative/Grunge influences. All of this put together and you end-up with one of the more criminally underrated ND albums even though it's their best.\n\nBest songs; \"Twist The Knife (Slowly)\", \"Remain Nameless\", \"Plague Rages\", \"Armageddon X7\", \"Throwaway\".\n",
        "\nMuch has been documented about Napalm Death's return to grinding, blasting form since their 'Enemy of the Music Business' album of 2001. Having heard that album soon after its release, I could hear the band was genuine in its intention of returning to the more intense, extreme type of sound that put latter day Napalm Death -i.e. Barney Greenway era - on the musical map. Since that album, the band has released album after album of such intensity & brutality, each gaining a substantial amount of positive press & reviews, including the album reviewed here, the 'Smear Campaign' album of 2006. \n\nHaving read many reviews of the album prior to hearing it, the main focus was always on the album's intense, uncompromising delivery, & the band's brutally honest intention to absolutely shred. So then, while listening to the album, it is clear & unmistakable that it certainly lives up to that reputation. The album starts with a bleak sounding instrumental, 'Weltschmerz', which is rather musical & moving, as well as methodically mid tempo in serving as a prelude to what follows it.....because then starts the shredding. With the second track, 'Sink Fast, Let Go', begins the uncompromising assault that the band has made its trademark once again. What you get here is the trademark blistering & intense grindcore/death metal that only Napalm Death know how to deliver, with good song structure, strong captivating riffs, & good variation throughout each song, never boring the listener. This skillful & punishing delivery continues as the album rages on with songs like 'Fatalist', the ambitiously titled but convincing 'Puritanical Punishment Beating', & one of the highlights of the album, 'When All Is Said & Done', with its strong chorus line. While each song may follow a slightly different formula in terms of arrangement, there is always good variation in riffing & tempos, from blast sections, to thrashing parts, to mid-tempo heavy breakdowns. \n\nAs this assault continues song after song, there is no doubt this album is living up to the acclaim the many reviews praised it with in terms of intensity & conviction in the music. There is something else though, that becomes just as evident which is not so positive.....& that is the production. What is soon noticeable from the first song is that the album has a rather dry, dead sounding production. Its not that it lacks power, there's certainly a powerful sound here, but there isn't any of that 'live' feel that was present on albums like 'Harmony Corruption', or 'Utopia Banished'. Instead the album has a somewhat more 'industrial' sound in terms of production. Everything sounds boxed in, dried out & muted. This is most evident with the way the vocals were mixed, as they have that muted, processed sound that is characteristic of the way 'industrial' heavy music is recorded. At first listen, I thought it may have just been an effect the band & producer attempted with the first one or two songs, but disappointingly though, it continues for the entire album. The question that begs then is, if there was an idea to experiment with a somewhat more industrial sounding production, why not commit one or two songs to that? Why the whole bloody album? Most disappointing I must say, as this is not a step in the right direction if the band is to stay true its musical origins & the fans of the earlier albums. \n\nHaving said that though, the production & sound aspects are not a complete failure. The mix is quite competent in that most instruments can be clearly heard, except the bass guitar. Additionally, the sound in general is punchy, crisp & powerful enough. The guitars boast a heavy crunching sound, & the drums have a good punchy sound, although it loses some of its punch noticeably when the drums switch to faster blast sections, but not to the point of failure, & it is after all a common challenge with mixing drums when recording extreme grind or death metal. \n\nBarney's vocals sound somewhat like a throwback to those on 'Utopia Banished', in that they are a semi-growled, semi-shouted vocal style similar to those on that album. Nonetheless, Barney has extended his vocal range to include high pitched screeching & some rare clean vocal sections, all of which are competently perfomed, adding a plus to the vocals. \n\nI seem to find the best songs are tracks 7-10, with track seven, 'In Deference', possibly being the album's most memorable song, largely due to a most effective & memorable middle section, featuring guest vocals from Anneke from The Gathering. \n\nGenerally, although this is a good album, it's not one of Napalm Death's best, & when deciding to listen to the band's musical output during the Barney Greenway era, I'd instead be listening to 'Harmony Corruption' or 'Mass Appeal Madness'.\n",
        "\nWhen people talk about new Napalm Death being good, it's usually with a sort of unsaid caveat that despite the modern material's quality it in no way stacks up with the first or second era of the band. Let me fundamentally correct that: the newer material by Napalm Death is most certainly as good as albums like 'Harmony Corruption', and I'd say is in many ways better than even seminal releases like 'From Enslavement To Obliteration'. Call me a poser if you like, but I genuinely think that the death/grind sound of newer material rather than the pure grindcore of 'Scum' is what Napalm Death has been meant to do all along, and at no point in the band's career have they been more consistently rock-solid and savage as they are now.\n\nDespite all this said about the death/grind nature of newer Napalm Death, I would still wager that this is closer to pure grindcore than the band has been since all the way back in the 'Utopia Banished' days. The opening strains of 'Silence Is Deafening' immediately take one to the early '90s, albeit with better production all around. The music here is a natural continuation of the previous two full-lengths, coming somewhere between 'Enemy Of The Music Business' and 'Order Of The Leech' in terms of absolute aggression and more subtle songwriting. All the tracks are uniformly fast and not quite technical but with a lot of jittery tremolo notes; the song structure are riffy and cyclic in nature but are immensely entertaining by virtue of just how well these guys work together musically. Variation is brought out through constant rehearsal of the tracks, making for deep and engaging music that's based off relatively simple principles.\n\nIf there's anything to complain about with newer Napalm Death material, it's that it rarely has standout tracks; 'The Code Is Red... Long Live The Code' is the same in this regard, and the differences and subtleties of each song will really only come out after a fair number of plays. But what it lacks in independence between tracks it makes up for in consistency, as there's not a single weak item on this disc. The deft and always blazing drumming of Herrera merges with Greenway's roaring vocals to provide a great rhythmic bass for the churning bass presence of Embury and Harris' incisive daggerlike tremolo riffing; the formula was established long ago and it still works here today. Production is clean, clear, and heavy, as it should be, and all instruments can be heard well. A brief comment about the guest performances: you barely hear them at all, strangely enough, so don't bother buying this just to hear Biafra.\n\nDiscussing Napalm Death in general is something of a fool's errand, as they've been so consistently massive and quality throughout their career. Every review for every one of their albums could really be summed up as 'go buy this', and this album is no exception. If you enjoy the Napalm Death style of savage death/grind, you'll of course want 'The Code Is Red... Long Live The Code'. It's another album in the catalog of one of metal's most enduring bands and shouldn't be missed.\n",
        "\nThis EP of covers is best when Napalm Death is playing to their strengths: oldschool punk and grind tracks that are clearly near and dear to them. The other stuff, though, is rather middling and seems to be more an example of Napalm Death trying to show off other elements of their style rather than what they're best at. About half of the material on 'Leaders Not Followers' is nearly essential for the Napalm Death fan, while the other half is better viewed as bonus tracks.\n\nThe good: the opening Raw Power cover is just the sort of thing this disc should have been full of. The blitzing oldschool hardcore of 'Politicians' is a perfect match for Napalm Death's extreme and grinding style, and the band definitely does a lot to kick the original up a notch while staying true to the style. 'Maggots In Your Coffin' retains all the nastiness and brutality of the original, not appearing overly clean even with modern production and note-perfect playing. And of course there's the one every Napalm Death fan knows: the band's rousing cover of 'Nazi Punks Fuck Off' is a staple of live shows for a reason with its ferocious vocal and drum performances.\n\nNot so good: everything else. The Slaughter and Death covers are of too fundamentally different a style from Napalm Death's origins to really be executed well. While they're true to the originals and played well enough, the band doesn't add any of their trademark fire to the compositions, so they're just sort of empty recreations. The Pentagram cover is really just a matter of being a mediocre song, and while Napalm Death do their best to liven it up with added brutality, it doesn't end up going anywhere.\n\nThe three solid tracks are really worth the price of admission, so I do recommend the Napalm Death fan pick this up, but I am a little disappointed in the rest of the tracks, which really would have been substantially better were they more similar in tone to the best three. Anyway, look at them as bonus tracks and be happy to chant 'YOU'RE! ROTTING! MAGGOTS! INYOURCOFFIN!\"\n",
        "\nI consider this album to be 'Inside The Torn Apart''s bouncier, more energetic brother. It's a natural extension of that album in many ways, firmly fitting within the death/grind/hardcore blend begun with 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair'. Unlike the crawling and dismal music which that album carried, though, the stuff on 'Words From The Exit Wound' is much more uptempo and rhythmic than that. It's probably a good album for those who want something closer to the Napalm Death from days of old or future, and it manages to be a fine parting shot from this era of Napalm Death before they abruptly returned to the punishing death/grind style of albums like 'Utopia Banished'.\n\nThere are no tracks in the vein of the title track from 'Inside The Torn Apart'; the music on this album is very uptempo and brutal, without most of the atmospheric touches and ultra-tense riffing that defined the previous LP. This is closer to 'Diatribes' in overall tone but is still closer to the 'true' death/grind of earlier years than even that. The music is more technical in the guitar department and much more feels like it's going on at once, even though the style of this album isn't really alien to what's been going on for the past several. There's a substantially lower amount of groove and more easily rhythmic sections, and a lot of the drumming is the syncopated snare battering from before but now with an extra dose of speed. Vocals are tight and springy and bounce off the savagely pounded chords nicely, and the production is, as always, very balanced and full.\n\nThere are some pretty massive songs on this CD; tracks like 'Devouring Depraved' approach Napalm Death classic status, and the added ferocity of the music on songs like 'The Infiltraitor' and 'Throw Down A Rope' make for music that's a bit more exciting than Napalm Death had been for several albums. It's probably the only release from this era that fans of more traditional Napalm Death would be encouraged to pick up, and it bridges the gap between the more traditional material and the experimental nicely, even if it is on the way out. The presence of memorable and engaging tracks alone already sets this far above albums like 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair', and it makes for something that's actually an enjoyable listen most of the time. I like the directness and intensity of these songs, and they're definitely in the upper echelon of content that Napalm Death produced during this era due to strength of songwriting.\n\nAs the final farewell of Napalm Death's death/grind/hardcore sound, this is a pretty fine parting shot; there's several tracks which continue to be relevant in the greater scheme of Napalm Death's catalog, and I pop this disc in from time to time without skipping any tracks. Recommended for those who have mostly ignored this section of Napalm Death's history; it's a bit faster and more straightforward, and the songs are worth your time.\n",
        "\nIt seems strange that this was seemingly advertised as a single for the track 'Breed To Breathe' off of 'Inside The Torn Apart' rather than for the four other tracks which are completely unique to this release. Anyway, this small release isn't mandatory but it's great for the serious Napalm Death collector who wants to hear everything the band's done; here's four tracks which appear nowhere else and are very strong tracks from the third era of Napalm Death.\n\nThe title track is of course strong and catchy, but is recycled and so the least important part of the package. The other four tracks are like more technical varieties of what's heard on the 'Inside The Torn Apart' album: death/grind/hardcore tracks laced with tense, single-string tremolo riffs blistering with a cruel and strained atonality and funk-influenced syncopated drumming. The songs move along at a good clip and don't get boring due to the highly varied and engaging drum performance, powerfully hot riffs, and, as always, the roaring vocals of Barney Greenway. The tracks never falter and are phenomenal examples of this era of Napalm Death, though perhaps lacking in the instant memorability of tracks from the LP they're most similar to.\n\nIt seems these tracks were recorded during the 'Inside The Torn Apart' sessions, being almost exactly the same in production as well as style. This isn't exactly a problem, as the music on that album is strong even now, and this related EP is no exception. In fact, the increased compositional density of the tracks on this CD might make them even better than the full-length, indicating a greater ambition and scope of artistic vision. A lot more seems to get done in these songs than usual on top of their natural catchiness and clever construction.\n\nWhile this is not a mandatory release, it's encouraged for Napalm Death fans to give this a listen if at all possible. The music is as savage and intelligent as ever and shows an aspect of style not quite replicated anywhere else in the band's career. Grab it if you can find it.\n",
        "\nWhat we get on \u201cTime Waits for no Slave\u201d is good, old school grind with a we bit of death metal and longer songs. There\u2019s the guitar work that\u2019s focused mainly on power-chords running up and down the neck in a familiar grind pattern which tends to stray every now and then, supported by frenetic drumming and blasting. But wait! Unlike old-school grind, these songs flow rather than starting and stopping with monumental tempo jumps, or have I simply gotten so used to grind that some of the tempo jumping seems normal? Whichever way it is, the tempo always flows just right through some extremely long grind tracks - by grind standards three and four minutes is pretty darn long! They make use of the time for real verses and choruses, something that most bands who start off eschewing that format often go back to.\n\nThere\u2019s just a tiny bit of experimentation that lays claim to a couple of songs here and there when the band wander off to an unexpected territory, the most obvious example being the strange singing on the title track, \u201cTime Waits for no Slave\u201d. Though what could be thought of as most bizarre once one puts some thought into it, is how strange Barneys voice is. At first listen, it\u2019s a wonderful grind bark that sounds illegible, yet I find myself making out the words all the time.\n\nNow \u201cTime Waits for no Slave\u201d would be a damn great album if it weren\u2019t for a couple of factors. With the number of tracks going up to fourteen, and the general nature of the songs being pretty quick, they do tend to blur a little by the time you get to the end. The other matter? \u201cTime Waits for no Slave\u201d does sound pretty similar to significant portion of other Napalm Death albums, most notably the two before this one, \u201cSmear Campaign\u201d and \u201cThe Code is red\u2026 Long Live the Code\u201d.\n\nAll being said, \u201cTime Waits for no Slave\u201d is still a fine way for young gun to become familiar with good ol\u2019 grind, and can easily hold those old-timers over looking to rekindle or romances with and old flame, metaphorically speaking.\n\nOriginally posted at www.waytooloud.com\n",
        "\nLike for lots of other bands, I\u2019ve always thought that the central part of Napalm Death\u2019s career has always been a bit overlooked. They are so famous for having put out the seminal grindcore album, Scum, but the albums after are not as famous as they deserve to be, especially if compared to Scum itself. I\u2019ve never loved that album and I\u2019ve always loved the death metal period instead, that sounded far more mature and competitive. OK, the grindcore on Scum was something revolutionary but we must be able to understand that even the central part of the career of this band was so important to forge the modern Napalm Death sound we all know. The violence of the early days was filtered down through the death metal and now with a touch of groove, a groove that was in bigger quantity on the album after this Utopia banished, that gloomy Fear, Emptiness, Despair.\n\n1992 Napalm Death was always bound to that grind/death formula that worked so well on the previous Harmony Corruption, one of the best efforts by this band. A young Danny Herrera took place behind the drums to replace Mick Harris. We begin with the gloomy, distorted sounds of the introduction, \u201cDiscordance\u201d to continue with the ferocious drums rolls and blast beats of the following \u201cI Abstain\u201d. Greenway is always the man behind the microphone and he\u2019s always able to transmit pure energy through of this growl, a truly hard thing to do in death metal. The first groove elements already start to come out during the mid-paced parts but the restarts are just savage death/grind ones with always the deserved intelligence to create always catchy and never chaotic sounds. \n\nThe production is fuzzy but dark as hell. Not that dark like the one on Fear, Emptiness, Despair but absolutely amazing. \u201cDementia Access\u201d is a kick on the teeth for speed and brutality. The band plays at the speed of light and the dynamism is something enviable. The tempo changes are numerous and they contribute in creating always mature and brutal compositions. The riffs are crust-like or death metal. No matter where the influences come from because the important thing is to create an impenetrable wall of sonic violence. All hail to Jesse Pintado. The distortion of the bass is something great because it conserved that primitive distortion (a way between Repulsion and the very first Napalm Death) and it fits perfectly for this dark and violent sound. \n\nThe fast songs run after each other in an infernal assault based on grind blast beats, punkish up tempo and grooving mid-paced sections. Everything is fucking catchy and made to snap tour head from your neck. The fury of this band knows no limits and to the punk elements of \u201cThe World Keeps Turning\u201d with those simple but devastating up tempo sections, we remark the iconoclast grind fury of that \u201cExile\u201d that pays tribute to the very first wave of this genre. One thing is evident: the coming of Jesse in the Napalm Death line-up was a revolutionary thing. His way of playing brought the perfect combination between death/grind and hardcore. Inevitably Terrorizer threw big shadows over the more recent Napalm Death production (post 1990). \n\nWell, all things considered, this is an album to appreciate for its sheer intensity. Maybe Harmony Corruption displayed more catchy sections with more standout riffs but my personal idea is that Napalm Death here really wanted to create a longer bridge with their past, with the experience they\u2019ve acquired along these years and with that new line-up. The intensity is the strongest point of this album, without shadow of a doubt. Once gain, I praise the post-From Enslavement to Obliteration era. It definitely gives me more satisfactions since I\u2019ve always preferred the death/grind combination, instead of the pure grindcore.\n",
        "\nI think this is probably the closest that Napalm Death got to properly executing the death/grind/hardcore mixture they'd attempted to pioneer back in the 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair' days. It's not perfect, but it's certainly the best of the band's albums in that vein, mostly achieving what albums like 'Diatribes' had attempted and failed to do. It's catchy and grooving without sacrificing the death/grind elements which define Napalm Death's sound and manages to be memorable and an exciting listen throughout its running time. In short, it's just about everything that Napalm Death aspired to be at this period in their career, and it manages to stand up as an enduring listen even now.\n\nThe thing that makes this better than the previous two albums is that it's not as boring as them. I can't think of a more elegant turn of phrase than that, but the previous two albums were pretty damn boring a lot of the time. It's not really the band's fault; they were settling into the new style and probably being a bit overly cautious in the process, but it all comes together on 'Inside The Torn Apart'. The music still resides in an upper midpace with a collection of groovy, power chord driven riffs over funk-inspired drumming, but everything has more motion to it on this album as opposed to the awkward stillness which tended to dominate albums like 'Fear, Emptiness, Despair'. The vocals are delivered more forcefully, and this might mark the moment where Barney Greenway's voice truly comes into its own and meshes with the band; it took a long time, but it's all good here.\n\nThe riffs really champion this album and manage to be surprisingly memorable despite being of a similar nature to those of the previous two. Greenway's sporadic clean/spoken vocals are used to surprisingly great effect on tracks like 'Breed To Breathe' without coming across as cheesy, and the drumming is propulsive and engaging with numerous creative fills and quality syncopated snare work. The tracks are very memorable, with the title number coming across particularly well with its ultra-tense main riff and tersely screamed verses, while others like 'If Symptoms Persist' are something of a throwback to older Napalm Death with a more straightforward, grinding feel. As the last album really in this style, it's good to see that Napalm Death really got it together, even if they were a bit late to the game.\n\n'Inside The Torn Apart' is not really a mandatory album in Napalm Death's catalog, but it is the best of Napalm Death's third stylistic phase and certainly worth a look from fans of the band. If you have to get one album from this period, it should certainly be this one, and I really do recommend it to the average death/grind fan who would like to see what good a fusion with hardcore can produce. This is an album that took a difficult combination of elements and truly made the best of them, and for that reason alone it's worthy of a bit more appreciation than it gets.\n",
        "\nIt goes without saying that Napalm Death are one of the most influential bands in metal (and punk) history. I mean, these guys were already underground legends by the time they released \u201cScum\u201d and when they released the colossal \u201cSmear Campaign\u201d they had become untouchable. \n\nTheir latest album is comparable to their 2006 effort in the sense that it is fast and aggressive in the vein of their first two albums, but with a modern metal production and more mature songwriting. Hell, the first four songs here could have easily been on \u201cSmear Campaign\u201d without any trouble. If someone enjoyed the aforementioned album, he could easily enjoy these songs as well. But after \u201cOn the brink of extinction\u201d the album takes a U-turn in terms of the feeling of the songs, and goes into darker territory. The atmosphere in the songs after comes in through the added effects on the vocals and the odd riffs most of the time, but to be honest I can't really place my finger on it. Atmosphere can't really be described in words, but the title track (and the song after that) is a perfect example of this. The dark feeling is a firm nod to \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d but other than that, the rest of the songs aren't much different. The song structures are very free flowing and spontaneous, but at the same time they feel strong and focused too. The first two songs, Diktat and Strongarm display the album's mature yet chaotic songs in the best way. \n\nThe individual performances on this album are top notch, which has been mentioned by the other reviewers also. Every member of the band is in top form, and this is the main reason why the album feels so tight. The legendary Barney Greenway also delivers one of his best vocal performances, the best since \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d in my opinion. His growls sound mechanical at times but not forced at all and he just oozes charisma. His high pitched screams have the power to make the songs become 10% better for a short period of time. The riffs here are brilliant, more catchy than in \u201cSmear Campaign\u201d and also show good variety, from the thrashy riffs in \u201cPassive Tense\u201d and \u201cOn the brink of extinction\u201d to the odd riffs in \u201cLife and Limb\u201d and \u201cWork to Rule.\u201d\n\nOverall, I think this is a great album. Napalm Death have finally managed to strike a balance between the aggressiveness of their grindcore days with the focus of \u201cHarmony Corruption.\u201d 2009 has only just begun but I feel that this might as well be the albums of the year.\n",
        "\nIt would be lying to claim that any other band is as influential to grindcore, or extreme music in the UK, as Napalm Death. Unfortunately it would also be lying to claim that throughout their near-30 year career, they have consistently managed to make albums that provide more than a quick break from the religious spinning of \u2018Scum\u2019 and \u2018From Enslavement To Obliteration\u2019. Sure, they were still good but there was always something a little off about their death metal output. Now, ladies and gents, for the moment of truth; the choice between two clich\u00e9 reviewing terms: \u2018Until now\u2019 or \u2018This is no exception.\u2019 Neither are particularly favourable in my books, but I think on this occasion a bit of dramatic tension is needed. There was always something a little off about Napalm Death\u2019s death metal output...\n\nUntil now. It should be fairly clear from the first, oh, four seconds of opener \u2018Strong-Arm\u2019 that this clicks. Maybe not surprising considering that four seconds is all the time you even get for some Napalm songs to click, but I\u2019ll be damned if \u2018Time Waits For No Slave\u2019 doesn\u2019t start as it means to go on. There is a fine balance here; the attack switches from mid-tempo death to a grindier velocity often enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, yet everything is wrapped up in one very aggressive sonic package, courtesy of Mr. Shane Embury. It\u2019s amazing how much one instrument can do for a sound; guitarist Mitch Harris doesn\u2019t even have to be following a riff for the paired bass and guitar to sound like an entire house of bricks flying through your window. Then again these guys always did know how to write a riff, and it shows on this record time and again.\n\nBarney Greenway is a loveable character; his no-nonsense live performances are the stuff of legend. However, as soon as he lets rip on \u2018Time Waits For No Slave\u2019, he commands your attention simply through his own ability. Despite arguably being a little on the layer-heavy side at times, the range and power in his voice is stronger than it has been for a long time. Lyrically expectations are met in typical Napalm style, lots of nice vocabulary which masks the politics as much as it enhances it at times. Perhaps his days as young radical are behind him, but Barney\u2019s still entitled to postpone the armchair, instead choosing to wax lyrical about stuff that pisses him off. \n\nSomething a little puzzling about \u2018Time Waits For No Slave\u2019 is how, despite being very solid, it becomes very tempting at times to listen to the really outstanding tracks and leave the rest unloved. The first six tracks kick enough ass for the entire album, but it\u2019s a 14-track, 50 minute piece of work and despite the best efforts of \u2018Procrastination On The Empty Vessel\u2019 and \u2018A No-Sided Argument\u2019, it can be a struggle to let the thing play through without having to listen to \u2018Diktat\u2019 another three times. Still, it\u2019s no time to complain when Napalm Death have finally released an album this good again, and boy is it. Let\u2019s just hope they can keep it up.\n",
        "\nSo here we have the 14th full length offering by Napalm Death. The first thing to know about this album is that in interviews Shane Embury stated that they wanted this album to be a more experimental album than their more recent work (The Code is Red, Smear Campaign), which when I first read that, was somewhat worried. The last time Napalm Death was experimental was the mid 90s, which, though the 4 albums they released in that era were decent, it was nothing compared to what they were capable of. That means that they sacrificed their trademark brutality and speed for a more laid back and semi-fierce sound. Skip forward to late November 2008, I find a download of the album on the internet. Turns out the word experimental has either been redefined, or was code for \"we are going to add some technical influences\". For my review I'm going to disect the instruments/vocals. \n\nLet's start with vocals. Barney is one of the lucky few whose vocals only become more powerful as time passes (with the possible exception of Harmony Corruption). Barney shows on this album that age doesn't do shit to hinder him. The best example of his vocal prowess can be found on track 3, Work To Rule. Here the first we hear of Barney is what can only be described as the bark of the hounds of hell as they are unleashed upon the world, not only does he give his most brutal performance yet, at the \"bark\" I alluded to previously he also shows off his fastest deliverance yet, which might tie into the aforementioned brutal depending on your opinion. Another shining example of vocal genious can be found at about the halfway mark of the same song, either the band use some major distortion or Barney is capable of vocals so haunting and brutal, Satan would shit himself. Besides that it's what you would generally expect out of Barney, pissed off as fuck vocals. Another thing to mention is the dragged out and creepy/cringe-worthy vocals he does in the bands slower doom-ish songs (Smear Campaign title track), they are still present on this album, but are balanced out at a 95-5 ratio with the rest of the vocals (95 being traditional Barney), with the only song being entirely composed of these, the bonus track Omnipresent Knife in Your Back, so unless you get limited edition no need to worry. Lastly in vocals I have to acknowledge Mitch and his insane high pitched screams, same as all other instances, but with each progressing album they are used more and more, and this is no exception. \n\nNext we have the drums. Danny Herrera is a very talented drummer no doubt. Overall his drumming at any given moment on the album doesn't stand out more than other instances on the album because he does the same for every song, transition with speed of song, play fast as fuck, slow it down, repeat. Though something about him that may be interesting is that he has maintained that with Napalm Death he does his blast beats with one hand only, the reason that this is impressive is because, on past albums that is obvious because the drums have a \"one-sided\" feel to them (they sound slightly flat and distanced), but on this album that sound is gone, and he plays faster than he ever has before, so either he decided to go two handed, or he is getting even more talented than before. \n\nGuitar up. Mitch Harris has been a driving force in Napalm Death for the majority of it's existence. Here on TWFNS he is no different. He is where most of the experimentation comes in, as I said before, experimental in this case means, some technical influences. He keeps for the majority of all songs the traditional Napalm Death song structure, but in some moments he throws in some classic Cryptopsy like technical riffing, which adds to the overall atmosophere of this album which comes together as Napalm Death's most impressive effort yet. Harris' most stand out moment on this album is the fairly rare grind solo. By fairly rare grind solo I mean that in modern grind, few if any bands do solos, and the ones that do sound like shit in a blender. But what we have here is the originators of grind (Repulsion, Carcass, and Terrorizer didn't create it, they evolved it) and they are not bound by modern grind protocol. The solo is towards the 3/4 mark on track 13 A No-Sided Argument, this solo is nothing that will stick with you for the rest of your life, but is slightly impressive. Normally this would take away from the score, but as solos aren't a staple in grind it only gives extra credit. \n\nThe bass is last. Bass is something one doesn't expect to see much of in modern death or grind, and yet here we have Shane Embury playing his soul out. Usually I wouldn't notice the bass in a song unless it is so obvious a deaf person could tell you it was there. But it seems there is an exception to every rule. What is impressive here is that Shane demands your attention and respect, and if you ignore the bass will kick your ass. Now another exemplary moment of skill shown by Shane I discovered by drinking 2 and 1/2 liters of Mountain Dew and eating a gelato, this wired me to the extreme and gave me superhuman senses of smell and hearing, the smelling was inconvenient, but the hearing part made it possible to hear and make out every single note of the bass, and I saw just how intricate the bass was and how it was integral to the song. \n\nThats it for my review and here is the synopsis: \nStandouts: All, especially tracks 3 and 13. \nLastly, even if you are not a fan of grind, give this album a chance.\n",
        "\nNot sure what the purpose of this split is; maybe just promotion for each band. It's incredibly brief and seems to serve no real purpose other than filling out the collections of die-hard fans of either band. Though the music isn't bad, at only twelve minutes, I could hardly describe this as a necessary purchase.\n\nNapalm Death's two tracks are kind of interesting. 'Food Chains' is groovy death metal very much in the 'Diatribes' vein, with almost Korn-like sliding chords all over the place and tribal-style drumming; you could almost confuse this for 'Roots'-era Sepultura if it weren't for Barney's always obvious vocals. The second half, a demo version of 'Utopia Banished''s 'Upwards And Uninterested' is a very different beast from the original version. I'm not sure if this was a rehearsal version recorded after the album version or before, but either way it sounds greatly like the material that Napalm Death would go to play on albums like 'Words From The Exit Wound', with a very streamlined sound defined by smooth tremolo riffing and rather unobtrusive drumming. It's the better of the two tracks.\n\nDespite having two other Coalesce CDs, I've never been able to really get into this band's material; their breed of technical post-hardcore never seems to settle into something that I find comfortable to listen to. 'A Safe Place' is dominated by constantly shifting rhythmic textures over strange, sliding riffs backed by a gutturally barked vocal performance. It's an interesting song from the perspective of drumming, but like most of the band's material, seems to resist listenability at all costs. 'Harvest Of Maturity' is much more relaxed, with small variations on the main midpaced riff being used to explore the musical space with similar drum theatrics as the first track; I prefer it to 'A Safe Place'.\n\nThis is a completely unnecessary release and despite the quality of the music I can't really recommend it properly; there's no real point to getting this. If you manage to get it for less than a dollar like I did, it's a nice collection filler, but it's otherwise perfectly easy to skip.\n",
        "\n'Fear, Emptiness, Despair' is really the album that 'Diatribes' should have been; it's more exciting than that release while not sacrificing any of the experimental elements that defined mid-era Napalm Death. It's not a full-fledged success, and it's certainly one of the weaker entries in Napalm Death's catalog, but it achieves its goals of experimentation and mid-paced introspection much better than 'Diatribes' managed to. It's a pretty crucial linchpin in the Napalm Death discography, as it signals the switch of the band from death/grind to a more experimental breed of grooving death metal that most found rather tepid. I kind of like it when I'm in the mood, but I certainly see where most would dislike it.\n\nNow granted this isn't quite as experimental as 'Diatribes'; it has a lot of genuinely death/grind riffs and blast beats, but it's certainly a big departure from 'Utopia Banished'. There's a much higher emphasis on grooves and upper midpaced riffing rather than diabolical tremolo and the mood has a great deal of uncertainty amidst the aggression; more like wandering through the fog after the bombing than undergoing the barrage itself. The rhythms are less straightforward, and though it's not a drum-dominated album, that instrument has a great deal more sway over the direction of the songs than on previous Napalm Death releases. The production is rounded but still kind of flat and lacking abrasiveness, especially in the overly clean guitar tone; a bit of a filthier sound would have done wonders for this release.\n\nBut then again, I don't know how much you could do for an album like this. It's more interesting than 'Diatribes' but most of the songs are still fundamentally unmemorable. None of the riffs or songs stick out in my mind despite the relative professionalism of their construction, and while it's pleasing when it's on, the album doesn't remain in the mind for more than ten seconds after it stops spinning. The fact is that Napalm Death was always a better death/grind band than experimental entity, so an album like this is really a matter of how little the band fails rather than how much it succeeds. I admire Napalm Death's attempt to do something new(ish) and interesting with releases such as these, but it's ultimately an unnecessary part of the catalog.\n\nThere's little to say about this music because there's just not that much content there; the riffs all seem to be variations of each other and it's the same case with the songs. It's not necessarily a BAD album, just surprisingly generic coming from a band like Napalm Death. I can't really recommend it but I suppose if you find it for a low price in a bargain bin somewhere it wouldn't hurt to grab. There's worse stuff, but I'd recommend one pick up other Napalm Death releases before this one.\n",
        "\nThe mid-90s were a period where a lot of the mighty fell, and few fell harder and more terribly than Napalm Death did. While other bands were gradually either dumbing down their sound, taming it for mass consumption, or in this particular case both at the same time. Between the castrated guitar-tone that sounds like something off up Sepultura\u2019s post-Cavalera period, the mess of disjointed ideas, and the perpetual mid-tempo groove going on here this could technically be seen as an early nu-metal release. Even Robb Flynn was doing stuff better than this during the mid-90s.\n\nMark Greenway has always had a less than stellar take on the death grunt, but most of what\u2019s on here sounds either like 3rd rate David Vincent work or someone farting frogs out of their ass. He really ratchets up the boredom factor on \u201cSelf-Betrayal\u201d, which is basically 70% taking rather than actual vocals; overtop a nice variety of dumb assed 2 note grooves of course. Some of the better work he does on here is during \u201cFiner Truths, White Lies\u201d, which in itself is a pretty sloppy collection of half-riffs and needless drum showboating, though not quite as ridiculous as what you\u2019d here out of Cryptopsy or Mastodon.\n\nThings get a little better after you get through the first 4 songs, although the really messy production and half-aggressive guitar tone masks it. \u201cAntibody\u201d is the only thing on here that manages to avoid getting itself stuck in groove land, sounding like a pretty solid death/thrash song half the time and loaded with grinding blast beat sections the other half. Greenway doesn\u2019t bother with any narrating or long grunts, and sounds closer to his older incarnation when he first joined up with this outfit. The other studio song \u201cAll Links Served\u201d gets a little repetitive, especially during the middle section, but at least avoids sounding like an outtake from \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d.\n\nThis was obviously far from a highlight for this band, especially considering how legendary a lot of their earlier stuff is. If you like Machine Head with low guttural barks instead of pseudo tough guy yells, this might appeal to you, but considering all of the extreme stuff out there that puts more emphasis on metal rather than crappy hardcore ala Biohazard, this is not something that you\u2019d want to blow money on. I got this second hand for $3 and I think the money would have been better spent on crappy McDonalds' food.\n",
        "\nThis is a bit of a curiosity in Napalm Death's discography. The band's career followed something of a bellcurve, starting with sloppy, punk grindcore, evolving into an experimental death metal sound, and then turning back towards a more pure modern grind sound, but this album immediately following 'Harmony Corruption' sounds much more like 'From Enslavement To Obliteration' than its much more death metal inspired immediate predecessor. It was something of a step down in my opinion; I felt that 'Harmony Corruption' was one of Napalm Death's best albums and I generally prefer their tighter, more mature death metal work to the frantic bursts of anger of their earlier career, and 'Utopia Banished' firmly leads on the grindcore side of their musical spectrum. It's a good album that avoids many of the pitfalls that plagued 'Scum' and 'From Enslavement To Obliteration', but I still would have probably preferred another more straightforward death metal album in its place.\n\nWere you to read this review before ever hearing the album, you would likely be surprised by that description when confronted with opener 'I Abstain', a very modern (for its time) death/grind track that hints extensively at the band's future direction. Its array of dogmatic opening groove riffs almost sounds like another band entirely, at least before it erupts into grinding chaos. After that, it all comes together: the following tracks are for all intents and purposes long, somewhat technical grindcore tracks with a pinch of death metal influence. Oddly enough, it feels sloppier than 'Harmony Corruption', both in instrumental performances and production. The hellish yet tight guitar tone of 'Harmony Corruption' is replaced by a sloppier, crustier one, and the drum sounds seem a great deal more rickety, probably due to being mixed a bit overly loud when compared to the strings and vocals. The cymbals in particular can be annoyingly obvious during some of the blast passages, but it's a relatively minor complain all things considered.\n\nThe songs are good, and unlike albums like 'From Enslavement To Obliteration', the whole album can be listened to in one sitting without boredom setting in due to the sameness of the group's early works. The death metal influence, while smaller than the previous album, does a great deal to enhance the songs beyond their traditional grindcore roots by adding a layer of technicality and intricacy to the riffing which makes the songs exciting and listenable. Without the complexity and sheer number of riffs, these songs would probably collapse under the weight of their length and somewhat more reserved performance than what was heard on 'Scum', but instead they're held together pretty well by the chaotic sense of melody that Pintado and Harris hold. Almost certainly virtue of Pintado's contribution, a great deal of Terrorizer influence can be detected in these tracks, particularly in some of the slower breaks which sound much more American than anything Napalm Death had done previously.\n\n'Utopia Banished' is a rather underappreciated album, though I'm not entirely sure why; the songs are strong and though this isn't the masterpiece that was 'Harmony Corruption' it's certainly worth the time of any death/grind fan. It's in the second string of Napalm Death albums I'd recommend purchasing, but it would still be difficult to go wrong picking this one up if you enjoy oldschool death metal and grindcore.\n",
        "\nThis is one of my favorite Napalm Death albums for several reasons. It heralds the entry of Barney Greenway, whose vocals I feel have always been much stronger than those of Naplm Death's previous vocalists. The production is stronger and the instrumental performances are tighter. But moreover, this is perhaps the purest combination of death metal and grindcore that Napalm Death ever executed, and the results are stunning, with long and involved yet still very aggressive and abrasive tracks filled with dark atmosphere and genuine anger. It's not as instantly memorable as other Napalm Death albums, and perhaps it's a good thing: it forces the listener to pay attention to what they're hearing, revealing music of much greater intricacy than anything from the band's earlier output.\n\nThe sounds of the instruments and vocals on this album are fantastic; much like the cover art, the sound is peculiarly hellish in nature, with a certain intensity that isn't communicated by any one feature alone. Maybe it's the guitar tone with its very simple yet intense distortion, or the sudden arrival of full-fledged death growls instead of the shouts of previous releases. Whatever it is, it conveys the sort of weight that previous Napalm Death releases lack, with a more definite aura of menace and darkness to it where the previous releases were merely angry for anger's sake. The songs themselves help convey that weight; generally around the four or five minute mark, there's a lot more room for the compositions to breathe and explore themselves via intricate death/grind riffing and frequent rhythm and tempo changes. Contributing greatly to the whole thing is Mick Harris, whose drumming starts on this album to incorporate some of the more unusual elements that would become a staple of later albums, such as his particular love of erratic snare notes and funk-based rhythms.\n\nThe riffing is strong and lacks the last tatters of good-time punk bounce that infected bits and pieces of the first two LPs. The only exception is the very out-of-place 'Suffer The Children', with its thrashy breaks and generally inappropriate feel when compared with the rest of the album. Call it Napalm Death's 'Angel Of Disease' if you will; the album would probably be better without it. The rest of it is almost extraordinarily good though. The death metal/grindcore combination (not death/grind; there is a rather important difference to be found) on this record is very savage, really feeling much like very fast and chaotic death metal most of the time. That's really what this is: traditional death metal played through the focusing prism of grindcore, making for death metal tracks that are much less orderly and predictable, but no less carefully constructed.\n\nThis is perhaps the first Napalm Death release so far in their discography that I can listen to the entirety of without ever feeling bored; the songs are much longer than the previous releases yet seem to capture my attention more. Maybe it's just Napalm Death finally shaking the last bit of punk off their bones; it feels like the band at this particular point was much more unrestrained by the shackles of d-beats and four-chord riffs. I like this album a lot and in general wish there was more music like it; it's more unique than it seems at first glance, at once logical and unpredictable without ever missing a step.\n",
        "\nI didn't really like 'Scum', but this album I definitely enjoy. It's not as punky as the first side of 'Scum'; really it's a natural step forward from that album's second side, but still much more 'songy' and coherent as a whole. The instrumental performances are better (though still nowhere near rigid) and the production is a substantial step up from the rehearsal room atmosphere of the band's debut. The package feels much more complete overall, which I guess isn't surprising since 'Scum' was originally intended to be a demo.\n\nThe fundamental importance of this album is that it's perhaps the most definite, clear, pure first grindcore album ever made. 'Scum' was rather excessively punky to fully hold that title and most others that could be theoretically crowned aren't as decisively absolute as this one. This is, in essence, grindcore in its purest form. Short and immediate songs with sped up crust/thrash riffs, ripping growls and screams, and blasting, chaotic drumwork. The songs aren't nearly as chaotic in general as the second side of 'Scum'. There are plenty of entirely intelligible riffs during even the most chaotic sections, and rhythmically the band is less tighter than the borderline noisecore of certain tracks on 'Scum'.\n\nI can't say the songs are particularly memorable (apart from the stunning 'Evolved As One', which, like many other future tracks goes to show that Napalm Death NEEDS to do an album of entirely slow songs), but at around a minute and a half each, they aren't really intended to be. It's an album to be consumed as a whole, as these bursts of brutality don't really stand up without a dozen or so of their compatriots as props. This is grindcore as it was originally supposed to be: an experience that is felt more than listened to. You're simply battered by the music more than pleased by it, and I have a feeling that that was the intention of the band from square one.\n\nThough it is a mighty step up from 'Scum', it's not my favorite album by Napalm Death. There's a couple of clear weak points. First and most importantly is a periodically weak vocal performance by Lee Dorrian, which occasionally slips into monotonous shouting that doesn't do anything to drive the music forward. The tracks are still occasionally rather simply structured without logical connectors from riff to riff. And while I appreciate this aesthetic of pure brutality and of the album being undergone more than listened to, I still prefer Napalm Death a couple albums down the road where the brutality was maintained but the music was more capable of standing up on its own merits rather than relying on its aesthetic.\n\nThat being said, this is still a great album, and not merely in the influential sense that 'Scum' was. It's a grindcore classic for a reason, and, at least in my opinion, the first and foremost example of the genre. Really a mandatory listen for all extreme metal fans both for historical and musical reasons. Napalm Death got better, but they were never quite this pure again.\n",
        "\nThe sole reason I bought this release (second hand, really cheap) was because I was still looking for a CD quality version of the split EP with S.O.B. I already had the other releases so I waited for this album to come available for a good price. I am not going into the individual songs nor the quality since I did that on the \u2018original\u2019 releases. I\u2019m here to judge a compilation.\n\nWhat\u2019s good about this album is that it has some releases that have been out of print for a long time now. So for those who didn\u2019t buy those releases back then, this is a great opportunity to get their hands on this material.\n\nPersonally I would have liked it a lot better if this had been a double album including their Peel Sessions as well or even the Hatred Surge and From Enslavement demos. Yet this album only has the more hard to get stuff from the 1989-1991 era. And it\u2019s all here. Almost no songs left out. There were a few obscure Dorrian-era recordings but some of those songs were later released on the 'Noise For Music's Sake' album.\n\nBest release here is the Mentally Murdered EP. But Honesty, that EP has been released on 12\u201d, on CD and also as a bonus on the first pressing of Harmony Corrpution. So in the end, the real collector has got 4 different versions of it. When hearing the songs from the split 7# with S.O.B. it becmes quite obvious these songs have been recorded around the same time and possibly even the same session. Guitar sound and vocals are very alike. Only difference being the length of the songs. But for more on that, check my review of that EP.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice addition if you only have the full length albums from ND from that period and don\u2019t want to spend much time searching for the EP\u2019s. It\u2019s hard to give a retrospective release like this a rating but for completeness I\u2019ll give it 85 points.\n",
        "\nFor those of you who think the \u201cHatred Surge\u201d demo was still too slow, too punk or those who found Scum too lightweight productionally, here\u2019s a 1986 demo that might interest you. Compositionally this demo is the missing link between their early days with Miles \"Rat\" Ratledge on drums and their 1987-1988 furious grindcore days. And it\u2019s even more than that. Just read on!\n\nOf course songs like \u201cInstinct of Survival\u201d and \u201cSiege of Power\u201d are in essence not that different from what can be heard on the Scum album but the sound and performance are very sloppy. \u201cUnclean\u201d is a hidden gem here. It would have easily been one of the better songs had it been on the A-side of Scum. This demo even holds the promordial version of a song that would not see the light of day until the 1988 F.E.T.O. album (\u201cPrivate Death\u201d) Although this version has different lyrics and is thrice as long\u2026 Come to think about it, only the title and one riff sound alike.\n\nI always wondered why the band never re-recorded lengthier songs such as \u201cAbatoir\u201d and \u201cWhat Man Can Do\u201d on a future album since those songs also appeared on more than one demo and obviously were two of their favorite songs in those days (played by both Ratledge as well as Harris). Okay, those songs are less aggressive than the average ND song in the years to come but didn\u2019t they write and record very different songs like Evolved As One and Contemptuous later on?\n\nI can imagine the band not wanting to use these songs during the Scum recording when they started to focus on the fastest material and a lot of the \u2018forgotten\u2019 songs here are more experimental than Napalm Death have been since. On \u201cWhat Man Can Do\u201d one can already clearly hear Broadricks typical guitar playing, including the dissonant wavy industrial elements that would evolve into his Godflesh songswriting.\n\nWhen focussing on those lenghtier experimental songs alone this demo even sounds like an omen of the 1992 Scorn debut \u2018Vae Solis\u2019. Scorn at that point in time consisting of the three members that recorded this demo and the A-side of Scum\u2026 Bullen, Harris & Broadrick going sick industrial metal all the way. It would have been so much fun if the threesome would have re-recorded those dissonant industrial tunes for the Scorn debut.\n\nIn the end one can even conclude this demo holds three old elements. There\u2019s some leftover punk, some grindcore and Broadrick\u2019s search for a new industrial guitarsound including hints of the future Scorn release. Therefor it is an interesting release for a metal historian and fun to listen to as well.\n",
        "\nAs the title suggest, the earlier \u201cFear, Emptiness, Despair\u201d album was a disaster. The band all of a sudden decided to play mid paced death metal with some industrial inspired sections here and there with a lot of groove metal thrown in. Fortunately the band succeeded to make a better album in that style, called \u201cDiatribes\u201d. \n\nWhat makes Diatribes better than F.E.D. ? Simply the increased focus on this style since the band had two years to get accustomed even more to composing this kind of material. The songs on Diatribes are just better, being more cacthy and compact.\n\nNow, apart from being better than its predecessor, there still is a reason it isn\u2019t a highlight in their career. For one, the band is borrowing too much ideas from other bands. Whereas they were trendsetters once, on this album they\u2019re followers, not leaders. Better said, \u201cBorrowers, not leaders\u201d.\n\n\"Greed Killing\" has great ideas and riffs but in combination with Barney's vocals it\u2019s just not catchy nor melodic nor brutal enough. \"My Own Worst Enemy\" combines groove metal with an incidental black metal riff and an intro that could've been written for Meathook Seed. The funky drum intro on \"Just rewards\" is missing the point because it is \u2013 de facto - not funky. Nor does not possess the right feeling of groove. The drums sound like Fear Factory in the wrong kind of way. The groove of \"Placate, Sedate, Eradicate\" is much better (also great backing screams). Furthermore, until vocals join in, the song \"Take The Strain\" could've come straight from Anthrax' Stomp 442! \"Cursed to Crawl\" is a failed attempt at incorporating too much groove and rap. Napalm Bizkit!\n\nI could go on but I\u2019ll just mention the real highlight next. For those who remember some old ND songs with Justin Broadrick on guitar like \u201cWhat Man Can Do\u201d or \u201cDeath By Manipulation\u201d (check out their 1986 From Enslavement demo for those!) or even \u201cContemptuous\u201d on their \u201992 Utopia Banished album, \u201cCold Forgiveness\u201d is not that big a surprise but still a refreshing moment. It\u2019s an industrial song with many layers of creepyness. It is the best and most daring experiment on the album.\n\nThe crustcore section of titletrack is great and the song as a whole the most dynamic of the album and one of the most aggressive ones here. Together with \"Ripe for the Breaking\" which is one of the few songs with a blast speed.\n\nApart from the lack of originality the album also often fails in terms of aggressiveness and energy. For a band like Napalm Death this cannot do. A lot of songs sound rather tame. I\u2019m still not sure if this is caused by the bands performance, the production or both. It really doesn\u2019t matter though since the album as whole is still not good enough to spend your money on unless you\u2019re a die-hard Napalm Death collector.\n\nHighlights: Ripe for the Breaking, Diatribes, Cold Forgiveness\n",
        "\nIdentity crisis all over. During the first half of the nineties Napalm Death had been changing their style on each album since Barney & co. joined. \u201cFear, Emptiness, Despair\u201d is no exception. In the years of thrash vanishing from the scene, death metal becoming a hype and groove metal taking over, Napalm Death decided to have a go at grooving as well. In future years (the next three full length albums) the band proved they could pull it off, but not yet on \u201cFear, Emptiness, Despair\u201d.\n\nWhen listening to opener \"Twist the Knife\" one gets the feeling the band is screaming out loud \"you see, we can actually play technical metal\". Unfortunately this damages the intensity of the song. Furthermore the song lacks a point and direction. This tendency comes back to haunt this album a lot more.\n\nApart from this a lot of songs just drag on in a dull mid paced way and only incidentally provide some great new ideas like the eerie dissonant middle section of \"More Than Meets the Eye\". Playing mid paced isn\u2019t a bad thing but one has to come up with good riffs, rhythms and/or vocal lines. As far as the mid paced riffs go, Napalm Death suffer from mediocity.\n\nThe album isn\u2019t bad the whole way though. \"Remain Nameless\" has most in common with Harmony Corruption (especially Suffer the Children) and the song has enough energy and dynamics to stay interesting. The second half of the song is wavy and atmospheric and these parts are more interesting than a lot of the mid paced pounders. \"Throwaway\" is really great. The song has good riffs and focussed drums. Even though the song almost feels overlong, it is the best song on the album.\n\n\"Primed Time\" is one of the few grindcore based songs on the album but focusses too much on breaks and riffs instead of a brutal in your face composition. A band like Macabre can pull this off yet Napalm Death unfortunately were not ready for this on this album yet since once again it results in a song missing direction and even getting slower and slower near the end.\n\nThe album has a weird drum production. Whereas the rest of the instruments and vocals sound 'normal', the drums sound as if it they were coming from an old wold war II radio. Talking about the drums. Danny Herrera plays fills and breaks at every possible moment. I like what the man has done on a lot of ND albums but here he is clearly overenthusiastic and exaggerating. Despite the guitars sounding reasonably normal, they are too loosely played and extremely downtuned, making it all sound rather muddy.\n\nPlaying slow isn't a bad thing but compensating dull songs with overactive drums is annoying. So are some vocal lines which seem to have been written without a song in mind and therefor just placed at random onto the music. Napalm Deaths first attempt at playing slow and/or groove is a failure. The band would prove to be much better at it on their next few albums.\n",
        "\nUtopia Banished is one of the odd albums in my collection. When I first bought it, I was rather disappointed. There was something missing. Eventually I discovered I was mostly missing Mick Harris\u2019 typical drums. His hyperactive approach on kick and cymbals were missing here and replaced by the much tighter and more organised sounding Danny Herrera. Which resulted in the music sounding less manic and more death metal orientated. So even though compositionally on paper Utopia Banished was more brutal than Harmony Corruption, it sounded a bit too polished and tame for me at first.\n\nBut when further analysing the material here it becomes obvious the album is more grindcore than meets the eye. Yes, it has a certain death metal atmosphere but this is mostly because of the guitar sound, Barneys vocals and as said the tight performance on drums. The songs and riffs aren\u2019t really that different from Napalm Death during their Mentally Murdered period and, more notable, Terrorizer. Yes, you\u2019ve heard me. Terrorizer. Especially when listening closer to a song like \u201cI Abstain\u201d one can hear those typical World Downfall-ish riffs and breaks. It\u2019s just that Pete Sandoval is missing to complete to comparisson.\n\nA lot of the more grinding songs on Utopia Banished are mixing the Mentally Murdered and World Downfall styles. \u201cDementia Access\u201d being one of the most catchy stand out songs here. It is hard to say if Utopia Banished was a step back compared to Harmony Corruption but it sure as hell sounds a lot more like Napalm Death than 'Harmony...' did if one takes the time to listen more closely.\n\nIt\u2019s songs like \u201cThe World Keeps Turning\u201d that build a bridge between their death metal-ish Harmony Corruption/Mass Appeal Madness era and their rediscovered grindcore approach. The result is a catchy song with lots of dynamics, changes in pace and a furious attitude. Closing song \u201cContemptuous\u201d is a wavy industrial song with the remembrance of Justin Broadrick surrounding it but fails to be as dynamic as for instance their earlier \u201cEvolved As One\u201d (F.E.T.O. 1988). Not a bad song though and a great way to cool down after this grindcore assault.\n\nAs said, this album is not a Napalm Death album I would advise to anyone discovering the band and most of the time I myself pick a different album when I\u2019m in the mood for some Barney-era ND. But each time I play the album once in every two or three years I like it better than before. Over the years it has grown on me. It\u2019s actually pretty good!\n",
        "\nThis album is actually very catchy. From the beginning of Breed to Breathe you get some catchy riffs that stick in your head for days. This album is one of those albums that you may not have listened to in a few years but when you finally give it a spin again you remember how great it is. Yes this is not your grindcore Napalm Death but more of a grove death metal. The songs range from 3-4 minutes and keep the listener interested all the way through. \n\nProduction is clear yet not to polished...just in case you Napalm Death fans think they sold out. Every instrument can be heard. Vocals are your typical mid nineties style of vocals resembling a Fear Factory type of vibe.\n\nGuitars are catchy, very catchy to be honest. Its good to hear some variation in death metal rather than monotone riffs for forty minutes. Don't let this statement fool you this album is heavy, but catchy. Once in a while there is a few melodic riff to keep things interesting. Check out the songs, Section, Down in the Zero, and Prelude. These sections are not In Flames melodic but give off a slight breath of fresh air. Section and Indispose melodies have quite an epic vibe to them.\n\nDrums are not blast beats but more of your typical type of mid pace metal such as Sepultura, Pantera, etc. \n\nBasically if your someone who enjoys experimental work from bands, Inside the Torn Apart isn't a bad place to start. If your one of those purists out there just think of this...Napalm Death tried mid paced death metal and kicked ass at it. Maybe several bands should have took notes on how to do it right.\n",
        "\nI don't like this album very much. I think I'd like it more if most of the albums that came after it weren't exponentially better than this. I realize that 'Scum' is really just a demo with a set of bonus tracks, but it's still sort of overly primitive to me, even as someone who enjoys crust/grind stuff. It seems very unfocused musically compared to even the next album, and while I appreciate its contribution to grindcore as a whole, I can't say I really enjoy listening to it very much.\n\nSide one is substantially better than side two; a lot of people generally agree with that statement. The second half concentrates on noisier bursts of aggression than the first. Side A is much more musical overall with a much greater note from their early hardcore punk days. You could say that side 2 is really where grindcore as we know it begins, albeit in a very chaotic and primordial form. Most of the songs that everyone remembers are on side one, however, including tracks like 'Instinct Of Survival', the title track, and 'Siege Of Power'. There are some really great tracks on this release and it's no wonder that it's as widely lauded as it is, as it is an extremely groundbreaking and crucial release in the scheme of metal as a whole. And yet at the same time I feel no desire to listen to it, really.\n\nI like the tracks on 'Scum' much more on other recordings. The production and playing do a lot to hurt them, honestly. Maybe I'm not a true fan, but I like Napalm Death more when they incorporate at least a little death metal into their sound, and so I prefer tracks from 'Scum' with the tighter instrumentation and more death-oriented vocals that the band later grew into. The production on this record is very weak throughout; it's noisy but the instruments have little punch, particularly because the drums frequently overwhelm the guitars. The playing is not very steady either, with the members of the band often falling in and out of time with each other. It's strange that all these imperfections are something I enjoy in other grindcore bands but find distasteful on this particular record, even when all logic says I should find it MORE acceptable than I ordinarily would.\n\nIt's like I can understand that the music itself is of high quality but I can't enjoy it; it's like 'Under The Sign Of Hell' part two. I like the punky/grindy riffs and the dynamic song structures that walk a very tense line between frantic chaos and speedy crust. I enjoy how direct everything is and how a fundamental lack of subtlety is sort of made artistic by the insane brutality of the music on display. The instrumentation is unique and groundbreaking for its time. The overall package is extraordinary and crucial for any serious metal or grind fan to listen to several times if only for historic reasons. But for my personal Napalm Death fix, I'll always go to one of the band's later albums rather than this one. It just lacks the steadiness that I enjoy in the band's later works. If I want straightforward chaotic crust/grind I'll go listen to early Extreme Noise Terror. But for Napalm Death, I like it a bit more grounded.\n\nObviously this is an entirely mandatory album and I highly recommend you hear it, even if it's not really to my tastes for reasons I don't entirely understand.\n",
        "\nOhw how I remember buying this one some 18 years ago. It said 25 tracks on the front and it had some Napalm tracks I never heard about! Later I found out some of these were covers which in turn led me to discover some more great bands from those days.\n\nNow I you have the \u2018Scum\u2019 album the versions of these songs are in most cases much better here. Scum suffered from either the production or from the fact that the B-side consisted of a new line-up which still had to get accustomed to the style. Here we can here a more experienced and focussed group of youngsters. The sound is more transparant, the guitars more furious and the vocals are much more varied and dynamic.\n\nThe first 12 tracks were recorded in 1987 and I featured some \u2018new\u2019 songs like \u201cLucid Fairytale\u201d, \u201cObstinate Direction\u201d \u201cBlind To The Truth\u201d (which were later recorded on the F.E.T.O. album), \u201cDead\u201d (appearing later on The Curse EP) and \u201cIn Extremis\u201d and \u201cYou Suffer prt.2\u201d which were both extremely short noise eruptions. Personally I prefer the F.E.T.O. versions to the earleir mentioned threesome but the songs from Scum sounded very good here, especially the B-side tracks \u201cLife?\u201d, \u201cPrison Without Walls\u201d, \u201cNegative Approach\u201d, \u201cDeceiver\u201d and \u201cCommon Enemy\u201d. Personally I would have liked liveversions of \u201cSuccess\u201d and \u201cAs the Machine Rolls On\u201d as well obviously. \n\nThe next 10 tracks get even better. Again the band got slightly better in their performance and sounded a tiny bit heavier, resulting in very good, tight and aggressvice versions of oldies like \u201cInstinct of Survival \u201c, \u201cConservative Shithead\u201d, \u201cControl\u201d and an enormously good brutal version of \u201cDivine Death\u201d. Also memorable are the great guitar noises on the intro of \"Moral Crusade\". Please note how this second Peel Session only features one (!) song from the F.E.T.O. album, \u201cWorlds Apart\u201d (great intro riff by Bill Steer!). I\u2019m glad they did actually. Much more room for good \u2018new\u2019 live versions of Scum tracks left since F.E.T.O. was perfect as it was already! \n\nThe last four tracks are a bliss. The Siege cover \u201cWalls\u201d is slightly tighter, less hardcorish and more grinding than the original and vocally a more than adequate performance by Lee Dorrian with Mick Harris screaming along. \n\u201cRaging In Hell\u201d, and \"S.O.B.\" being S.O.B. covers. The vocal funniness and sleazy guitar details of the original Raging Hell version are well copied by the Napalm Death boys and their version kicks serious ass. Closing off with \"S.O.B.\" which, kind of, is the Japanese \"You Suffer\".\n\nWell, concerning \"Conform Or Die\" I'm having serious doubts about it actually being a S.O.B. cover since the song can't be found on any S.O.B. release and on the original Napalm Death Peel Sessions this song is NOT quoted as being a cover. I really think it is either from another band or really an obscure Napalm Death songs. It is not the most enervating song but Steers short lead in the middle is quite funny.\n",
        "\nHere with have a split 7\u201d featuring two of the most classic grindcore bands from the late eighties, Napalm Death from England and S.O.B. from Japan. Apart from both being two of the important originators of the genre, these bands had also become friends and Napalm Death even covered two S.O.B. songs on their 1998 Peel Session. Now it was time for both bands to share a record together. We\u2019re talking Napalm Death here so I\u2019ll have my say about the S.O.B. on their bandpage.\n\nWhen listening to the production and performance of these recording I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if these songs were recorded during the same sessions as the \u2018Mentally Murdered\u2019 EP. The guitar sound is similar and so is Lee Dorrians performance.\n\nBiggest difference with that EP however that this 7\u201d only features short songs (Mentally Murdered had an average of 2:30 minutes per song). The Napalm Death side of this record has 6 songs in 4:32 minutes, which is an average of 43 seconds per song. Obviously we\u2019re talking fast furious grindcore here with not much room left for breakdowns, D-beat parts or whatever.\n\nHowever, first song \u201cMultinational Corporations\u201d is ofcourse a re-recording from the opening to the \u2018Scum\u2019 record and very industrial and doomy. Last song \u2018Stalemate\u2019 has some great uptempo crustcore sections. So it\u2019s not blastspeed all the way. I\u2019d prefered some more variation personally but seeing the over all length of the release that\u2019s a minor complaint since it\u2019s all over in a jiffy.\n\nI you want these tracks, simply get the Death By Manipulation album. But for collectors with an historical sense it is a must have. Napalm Death and S.O.B. on one EP. Enough said. But you\u2019ll probably have difficulties finding an original one instead one of many bootleg versions. \n\nThe S.O.B. side is over in 4:50 minutes and the emphasis is on short grinding songs. Within this racket however the band did find some time to have some breakdowns.\n\n\u201cDevice\u201d even starts off with a crossover riff that could\u2019ve come straight from the S.O.D. album \u2018Speak English Or Die\u2019. Of course this song eventually erupts into pure musical violence. \u201cRepeat At Length\u201d starts really doomy and has a nice breakdown in the middle. \n\nBoth \u201cDeceiver Pr2\u201d and \u201cHumanity or Stupidity\u201d are short grinders. \u201cDeceiver, Part 2\u201d obviously being a Napalm Death cover (the version WITH the Repulsion intro)\n\nNow this isn\u2019t the highlight of S.O.B.\u2019s career. For that you\u2019d obviously have to get \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d and \u201cDon't Be Swindle\u201d but it\u2019s fun hearing the band at their most furious. For collectors with an historical sense it is a must have. Napalm Death and S.O.B. on one EP. Enough said. But you\u2019ll probably have difficulties finding an original one instead one of many bootleg versions.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m not giving 60 points because the material here is bad. I\u2019m giving it 60 points because this release only features one interesting recording out of three. And even that song is now available on a compilation album.\n\n\u201cSuffer The Children\u201d comes straight from their Harmony Corruption album. It\u2019s a great song combing death metal with D-beat crustcore and some grindcore thrown in. It\u2019s one of the most catchy songs from their Harmony Corruption album. \n\nThird song \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d is in fact not a song but a bunch of noise. Never understood it\u2019s use. Maybe it was originally an intended intro our outro for that album but never used? Who cares, on itself it\u2019s really boring and obsolete.\n\n\u201cSiege Of Power\u201d is ('was', actually) the sole reason to get this EP. This is a re-recorded song originally from the Bullen-Broadrick era of Napalm Death. It is in essense a very catchy crustcore song with a lot of Discharge, some blast speed eruptions and played with metal-proof palm muted riffing. It\u2019s nice to hear what this song sounds like when played by the 1990-1991 line-up. Because of the production and vocals it sounds more death metal than before.\n\nIf you just want to have all Napalm Death recordings, these songs are all on the \u2018Death By Manipulation\u2019 compilation album. If you really want to have each release, good luck and don\u2019t spend too much money on it I\u2019d say.\n",
        "\nWhen I saw the video to the titletrack on TV somewhere in \u201991 two things were very notable. The music was played more aggressively than on the Harmony Corruption album and secondly Barney\u2019s vocals sounded more vile and convincing. The return of screaming backing vocals (Mick Harris?) were nice to hear again.\n\nYes, it is very obvious how the 1990-1991 line-up of Napalm Death have grown accustomed to eachother and the style the played. The attitude of the composition and performance are stunning. Second song \u201cPride Assassin\u201d built a bridge between the last ND days of Dorrian & Steer and the previous Harmony Corruption album.\n\nWhat also makes it obvious the band rediscovered their roots is that they also re-recorded two old \u201988 songs which actually don\u2019t fall out of place next to the new songs. Now with that \u2018modern day\u2019 heavy guitar sound and Barney on vocals all songs on this EP are remarkably cohesive. Not forgetting to mention Mick Harris was still around to play these songs with his typical hyperactive crusty style.\n\nWhen hearing this version of \u201cUnchallenged Hate\u201d it is even less possible to deny that Napalm Death already used some typical (death) metal riffs on the F.E.T.O. album. \u201cSocial Sterility\u201d is the more brutal one and features some of the most classic lyrics from the Dorrian-era. Comparing these songs to the originals is like comparing the 1988 version of Maiden\u2019s \u201cProwler\u201d to the 1980 version with Paul Di\u2019Anno\u2026 You get the idea.\n\nFor collectors this EP might be fun to look for but for the rest of you these recordings are also available on the compilation album \u201cDeath By Manipulation\u201d\n",
        "\nWell, this was a big leap forward compared to the earlier F.E.T.O. album. The individual musicians have grown a lot. I can\u2019t say too much about Shane Embury because he is buried in the sound.\n\nThe growth becomes most obvious of the re-recorded version of the song \u2018Mentally Murdered\u2019. Except being a lot tighter the guitarsound was a lot heavier, even comparable to the sound Bill Steer has on the Carcass album \u2018Symphonies Of Sickness\u2019 albeit a bit dry. Speaking of Carcass, there\u2019s a great solo on \u2018Walls Of Confinement\u2019 that has that Symphonies-atmosphere.\n\nLee Dorrian grunts deeper than ever. It takes a lot of effort to understand what\u2019s coming out of his mouth. \u2018Walls Of Confinement\u2019 is the most comprehensible. Mick Harris plays an important part to the band sounding a lot tighter. He\u2019s become quite a good metal drummer here and also his D-beat sounds brutal and tight.\nNow the compositions on itself aren\u2019t even that different than the F.E.T.O. album. The sound may confuse some but if you notice how the \u2018new\u2019 songs are written compared to the re-recorded track \u2018Mentally Murdered\u2019, it\u2019s actually pretty much the same style, only played better. So the biggest differences can be found in performance and production.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to point out \u2018best\u2019 songs here as they all are great. \u201dRise Above\u201d, \u201dMentally Murdered\u201d and \u201dWalls Of Confinement\u201d are remarkably catchy and \u201cThe Missing Link\u201d had a great Extreme Noise Terror-ish crustcore beat to it. If I had to complain it would be that 'No Mental Effort' is slightly over-strechted.\n\nThe 'Mentally Murdered' EP is a classic example of a band becoming proffessional at making noise and playing great songs as well.\n",
        "\nWhen this came out I could not believe it was Napalm Death. It wasn\u2019t actually. As the title of my review says, it\u2019s (almost) a brand new all-star-band paying tribute to eighties grindcore they actually conceived earlier themselves. A bit weird. \n\nWe have two Members from Napalm Death (Mick Harris and Shane Embury), one from Terrorizer (Jesse Pintado), Mitch Harris from Righteous Pigs and finally the only member to come from a second rate band, Barney from Benediction.\n\nNow to make every things even funnier. The album does not sound like Napalm Death, Terrorizer, Righteous Pigs nor even Benediction. And in fact at the same time also sounds like the lot of them combined. We were entering Napalm Death phase 3\u2026\n\nMick Harris\u2019 raging madness on drums is still here but he has improved a lot over the years (something which became very obvious on the earlier \u2018Mentally Murdered\u2019 EP). The midpaced sections and rolling double bass sound very convincing. Shane Embury can hardly be heard. \nJesse Pintado\u2019s sound is very much present. It\u2019s almost the same typical \u2018Morrisound\u2019 as his earlier Terrorizer album had. A thing you could say for Mitch Harris as well since the last Righteous Pigs also had that production. \nBarney sounds like Barney. Pretty hard for a vocalist to have an entirely different production, right? But clearly the man was a death metal vocalist and he doesn\u2019t sound very natural (yet) on his Napalm Death debut. Something he\u2019d improve on the superb \u2018Mass Appeal Madness\u2019 and \u2018The World Keeps Turning\u2019 singles.\n\nBecause of the production and typical vocals the album sounded more like your average 1990 US death metal band coming out of the Morrisound studios. Yes, a death metal band. Not a grindcore band. The sound was way too heavy for that and the compositions were mostly death metal with elements of grindcore. So goodbye to good old Brittish underground grindcore and goodmorning to intercontinental deathgrind! And actually \u2018Harmony Corruption\u2019 was a pretty good album!\n\nNow \u201cSuffer The Children\u201d actually sounds like an eighties crustcore song covered by a death metal band. And by Jove does it sound great! I\u2019d almost wish modern day death metal bands would lay off the over-technical Cannibal Corpse-Nile-Cryptopsy apporach and start playing this more straight forward style. I makes so much more sense and impact!\n\nFurthermore \u2018Harmony Corruption\u2019 is quite a catchy album. \u201cVision Conquest\u201d, \u201cUnfit Earth\u201d, \u201cThe Chains That Bind Us\u201d and \u201cMindsnare\u201d being remarkable sing-a-long compositions. A song like \u201cMalicious Intent\u201d unfortunately is too much on the slower side of death metal and sounds stretched. But those are minor complaint.\n\nOn future releases the band would sound more cohesive but I like this transitional album a lot. Mick Harris\u2019 drums still have that old Napalm Death touch and this is something that defines this album. \n\nThis is not an album I play when I\u2019m in the mood for some old Napalm Death nor do I play it when I\u2019m in the mood for the furious \u2018modern\u2019 Napalm Death which found back its roots around the 2000 album \u2018Enemy Of The Music Business\u2019. This is an album which I play on itself at least once every two years or so purely out of sentimental values.\n",
        "\nWhat we have here are two separate recordingsessions released as a single album. Also the line-up had changed halfway. So no wonder the A and B side sound quite different. \n\nThe first half were recordings from august 1986 when Justin Broadrick and Nik Bullen were still in the band. Justin already had a characteristic way of playing guitar, incorporating an industrial touch at times, a lot of feedback and playing punk riffs in a way you\u2019d expect from Celtic Frosts Tom Warrior. Combined with the more hardcore punk attitude of vocalist/bassist Nik Bullen it gave Napalm Death their own specific sound in 1986.\n\nDrummer Mick Harris and Heresy drummer Steve Charlesworth had been competing with eachother live in terms of playing faster than eachother. As a result Napalm Death in 1986 sounded twice as fast as they did during their \u201cHatred Surge\u201d days when drummer Miles Ratledge was still in the band. This line-up recorded the A-side of the album which included a lot of their older punk songs but placed at a higher pace than before (for instance 'Instinct Of Survival', 'Control' and 'Sacrificed') and some new, shorter and more brutal tunes. \n\nAs a result the A-side can be seen as a transitional period between hardcore punk and grindcore as we know it now. Not only are these songs very enjoyable but from an historical point of view rather experimental and groundbreaking. A Napalm Death fan cannot imagine the band with their all time classics \u2018Control\u2019, \u2018Siege of Power\u2019, the titletrack and of course the shortest ND song ever, \u2018You Suffer\u2019 (Guiness Book Of Records: 1,316 seconds)\n\nThere are those who dislike the punk attitude of side-A. Are they having difficulties accepting that grindcore emerged largely from the punkscene? The fact that grindore later on got a life of it\u2019s own within the metal scene doesn\u2019t change that. Please go look for the 1984-1985 recordings of the American band Siege and check out old interviews with grindcore bands about their influences. Without punk there wouldn\u2019t have been grindcore nor even thrash metal for that matter! Live with it. And the influence of punk on grindcore can\u2019t be more obvious than on the first half of this record. It was history in the making.\n\nDue to Nik and Justin leaving, the B-side was a result of Mick Harri\u2019s persistence of continuing the band. With Bill Steer, Lee Dorian and Jim Whitley the \u2018new\u2019 group focussed on the fastest elements of the earlier recordings and left punk for what it was. One can hear Dorian and Steer still struggling with getting into this new style and they don\u2019t sound convincing all the time yet (something which became more obvious when the From Enslavement LP was released on which they sounded briliant!). Still the B-side had a lot to offer. It was more consistent than before, faster and some instant classics like \u2018Conservative Shithead\u2019, \u2018Life?\u2019, \u2018Moral Crusade\u2019 and \u2018Deceiver\u2019.\n\nFor some a lot of songs on this album have too much punk in them. Other find Side-B too montome compared to the variation in styles and pace on the A-side. In the end it\u2019s an album that in itself shows the remarkable evolution of a young band and incidentally influencing metal headsa dn punks all over the world.\n\nTo people who grew up with polished (modern) grindcore and find this album not to be brutal enough or too sloppy I can only say: these were a bunch of youngsters, without cash, experimenting and having fun. Don\u2019t expect a 21st century sound nor triggered super tight drums from a 1987 (underground) release. And heavy guitars do not automatically make something \u2018brutal\u2019. They just make it\u2026 heavy\u2026.\n\nNapalm Death weren\u2019t heavy, they were musically structured noise with a message. A buch of youngsters who used to play punk but under the influence of Genocide (Repulsion) and Siege got a whole lot of new ideas about extreme music\u2026\n",
        "\nWhat we have here is the ultimate Napalm Death (which from now on shall be called ND) album in the classic pre-Barney line-up. For a lot of metal fanatics their previous album Scum. Although groundbreaker, still had too much \u2018punk\u2019 in it. But on F.E.T.O. it\u2019s old school grindcore all the way. Not as sloppy as their earlier works yet not as slick and heavy as their Barney period, F.E.T.O. sounds underground as well as proffessional enough to appeal to more than one select group of listeners. It therefor is ND\u2019s most \u2018accessable\u2019 release from the eighties.\n\nLee Dorrian feels more at easy growling and grunting the socially aware lyrics compared to his performance on the B-side of scum. His voice has improved and therefor the dynamic performance is more consistent. Mick Harris\u2019 drums have slightly approved in terms of tightness which is logical considering that on the previous record the band was still experimenting and on this album they had crystalised their music.\n\nBill Steer? We all know what Bill Steer could pull of so his performance here sounds laid back and therefor pretty proffessional (if we can use that term in old school grindcore). Shane Emburys pressence is just a heap of distorted bass but is excatly what the music needs. \n\nWhereas \u2018Scum\u2019 was the album that really started it all for ND, \u2018F.E.T.O.\u2019 was in fact their best! Tighter, more focussed and produced suitingly. It\u2019s not all noise or blastspeed. With \u201cUnchallenged Hate\u201d, \u201cMentally Murdered\u201d and especially \u201cDisplay to Me\u201d the band shows they can combine grindcore, crustcore and some pleistocenic death metal into aggressive, catchy and well played songs.\n\n\u201cRetreat to Nowhere\u201d and \u201cLucid Fairytale\u201d are two prime examples of the Scum (side-B) approach being worked out more efficiently. Brutal, short and with some ingeniously catchy riffs, breaks and vocal lines.\n\nLyrically the band was as furious and sometimes remarkably subtle as ever. For instance \u201cCock Rock Alienation\u201d (apart from a briliant title!) being a great song against corporate music or the even more impressive \u201cSocial Sterility\u201d (check it out yourselves).\n\nOf course, most grindcore albums since those days sound heavier, more brutal or whatever. But the intensity, drive and especially honesty surrounding this album is still hard to equal. F.E.T.O. is way up there with other early bands like Terrorizer, Carcass and Fear Of God (Swiss). \n\nIf you like grindcore, your collection can not exist (mustn\u2019t even be allowed!) without From Enslavement To Obliteration!\n",
        "\nNapalm Death, a name that needs no introduction to fans of extreme music. A compiler and crystallizer of influences and genres who in turn, gave birth to dozens of bands and genres hitherfore unheard of by anybody. This release is a swan song of sorts in the fact that it is the last release by what is a classic line-up. After this EP, each band member would go off in stunningly different musical tangents. Lee Dorian in the form of Cathedral, Mick Harris in the form of Scorn, Shane Embury, in the form of Meathook Seed, and Bill Steer in the form of the equally classic Carcass. \n\nThe opener 'Rise Above' has a nice mid-tempo ND riff in the beginning that is kind of their trademark. The blastbeats in this album are the fastest ever played by Mick Harris and Dorian's vocal style had progressed immensely since their debut 'Scum'-there is something in his vocals that sound distinctly non-human. Second up is 'The Missing Link', also popularized by 'The Grindcrusher Collection' released that same year. It has a brutal opening riff and face-melting solo after some nice riffy build-up. Another highlight is 'Walls of Confinement' which was also featured on the 'Live Corruption' albeit sans the haunting, melodic leadwork courtesy of Bill Steer. \n\nMusically,everything about this release kicks ass- it is a bold transition between the old, d-beat driven style of earlier releases and the death metal that would be 'Harmony Corruption', but managing to avoid any straight-up death metal as is. There is less emphasis on blasting, and more emphasis on riffing, which make the songs far more memorable and really establish a 'trademark' style of Napalm Death riffing. The overall production is good but with one complaint-the drums son't seem as loud as they should be, but this presumably has something with the sheer velocity at which Mick Harris plays.\n\nIt is interesting to speculate what this band would have become or what direction they would have went in musically if this particular line-up would have stayed together. Bands like Godflesh (ironically formed by former member Justin Broaderick) and Sore Throat (with their 'Disgrace to the Corpse of Sid' ) were already starting to re-define the essence of what extreme music was and could be, pulling it in opposite directions until it snapped. Seminal releases by both bands were extant at the time of the release of 'Mentally Murdered' and ND could not not be aware of them. Or maybe they would have stuck to the classic grindcore purveyed by bands today like Phobia and Insect Warfare. Whatever the case may be, get this release if possible. I highly recommend it-it has the ferocity of 'Scum' and riffs and arrangements comparable to 'Harmony Corruption'-in short the best of both worlds with superior production to 'Scum' but not quite the metal feel of 'Harmony Corruption'. In short, something that will make both punks and metalheads nod in appreciation. Which pretty much sums up the legacy of this classic, classic line-up.\n",
        "\nOne year after their well known debut album, the seminal british band Napalm Death attacked again with another raw and brutal album, called \"From Enslavement to Obliteration\". \"Scum\", their debut, is considered as the first grindcore album, and yes, it was rabid as hell, fast and brutal, but it lacked of maturity. Fortunately, this time the band was pretty much solid and established than in their first album, or at least it sounds like that, but that doesn't means a lost of their primal brutality, it is still the same.\n\nThis lineup had brilliant elements on it, particularly the vocalist, Lee Dorrian, Cathedral's leader and godfather of deathened doom metal, and the guitarist Bill Steer, who got his own name in grindcore and death metal with Carcass. The bassist, Shane Embury (which is the only member who remains in the band since their debut album) and drummer Mick Harris are the perfect support for Dorrian's manic gutural screams and Steer's machinegun riffs. The production is somewhat cleaner than the debut album and it helps a lot to the band, their massive strenght gets even more empowered by the production.\n\nWell, it's pretty hard to review an album like this, because it's something like 30 minutes of noise... but the greatest noise you'll be able to hear. The album starts with \"Evolved as One\", which is the most listenable song of the album. This track is more doom metal oriented (which is probably a hint of what will Lee Dorrian do with Cathedral), a deep bass line with a slow and stomping drum pattern domine all the three minutes of the song, the guitar is very secondary on this one. It works well as an introduction but it gets a little monotone when Dorrian yells \"your weak minds!\" so many times. After this \"peaceful\" intro, hell unleashes. Literally. There are three of four songs on this album which surpass the barrier of the two minutes, so you can barely distinguish one song from another. It's better to take this album like a 35 minutes song than like an 35 minutes album with 27 songs. Musically, there are some notable changes from \"Scum\" to this record, in \"Scum\" the punk and death metal elements were somewhat balanced but this time the death metal orientation dominates their music, although you'll hear some punk passages along this album, this is more a festival of growls, metallic riffs and blast beats. Of course the 3 or 5 seconds songs are still present, \"Your Achievement\" and \"Dead\" are as short as \"You Suffer\", but that \"song\" remains as the shorter song ever recorded.\n\nFinally, \"The Curse\" is \"Evolved as One\" without vocals, it works as a return to peace and normality after such a brutal discharge.\n\nIn my opinion, \"Scum\" is very overrated, if you want to get the true grindcore spirit of this british monster, then get this album. You will surely get many brutal moments.\n",
        "\nIt's not as bad as a lot of people would make you think, it's just boring. 'Diatribes' is probably the most widely disliked Napalm Death album they've put out, probably because it's not really much of a grindcore album, or even a death metal album for that matter. What it really reminds me of is a heavier, more brutal version of Sepultura's 'Chaos A.D.'; it's quite groove-laden and midpaced, with rather simple riffing and song structures throughout. It's really not very bad at all (unless you hate 'Chaos A.D.' and related works), but it's a very static Napalm Death album, and its place as the band's worst is probably legitimate. But if this is Napalm Death's worst, then they're better than just about any band out there as far as consistency goes.\n\nThere's one really, really bright spot on this album: the opening track, 'Greed Killing'. It's a fucking great song. It sounds nothing like anything else on this album or in the rest of Napalm Death's catalog for that matter, with its incredibly bright and evocative yet undeniably simple riffing and flawlessly bouncing and rolling drum and vocal rhythms. As far as what Napalm Death could do with the groove-based ingredients of this style, this song is probably the best that they could possibly come up with, and on its own, it's an essential part of their musical history. The five bucks I spent on this album were worth it for 'Greed Killing' alone.\n\nThe rest of the music doesn't fair quite so well. Aside from a couple memorable tracks such as 'Cursed To Crawl' and 'My Own Worst Enemy', the music on this CD is pretty dull and lifeless. It's the same thing that people would feel, again, with the change from Sepultura's 'Arise' to 'Chaos A.D.'. High-speed, aggressive riffing transforming into midpaced, groovy, textured pieces has generally never been a particularly welcome move in the metal scene, and this is another instance of where it objectively pretty much fails. None of the grooves are very compelling, and though there's a pretty great drum performance throughout by Danny Herrera, he's not backed up with riffs of any magnitude or import. Barney Greenway's overly straightforward vocal performance (apart from a few attempts at spoken word drama) just round out a generally uninspired and unnecessary album.\n\nEh, it's not an album I regret buying. 'Greed Killing' is an amazing track, and the rest doesn't offend me. It's of course the worst full-length in Napalm Death's catalog, and it's not an album that I can imagine anyone would say is a shining moment in their history or metal in general, but it's not the musical travesty that many people make it out to be. It's just that it's a merely average album from Napalm Death, which makes it by comparison seem like a musical Holocaust. Not bad, but not very good either.\n",
        "\nI believe that this Napalm Death album started the more groove period for a group that \u2018till here always did very violent albums, passing through different kinds of extreme genres. From punk/crust to grind/death \u2018till groove death. The albums after this one will show, \u2018till the end of 90s, a more \u201cprogressive\u201d approach but with this one we can always find pretty good violent songs.\n\n\u201cTwist The Knife (Slowly)\u201d is a different song in Napalm Death standards, as the following \u201cHung\u201d. Anyway the guitar sound is always fucking heavy along with true brutal vocals and some blast beats too. A good mix of rawest parts with a more groovy approach. The atmosphere is so gloom\u2026never before they created such obscure songs. \u201cRename Nameless\u201d is total mosh for the semi up tempo and punkish attitude. One of the best here.\n\nTo notice some filtrated vocals and strange guitar lines\u2026almost with an industrial touch but not so artificial\u2026odd, with a stench of abandoned factories where everything is so dark and lifeless. The other good thing is the songs length: they are never long, so if one of them is more progressive and groovy, like \u201cPlague Rages\u201d, is not boring at all. It is good to observe some out of the blue blast beats that break a bit the suffocating atmosphere made of fucking heavy riffs, like the one on \u201cMore Than Meets The Eye\u201d.\n\nThe tempo and the guitar work on \u201cPrimed Time\u201d are fucking great (quite fast, with blast beats too). \u201cState Of Mind\u201d features doom/progressive opening riffs with a crescendo of intensity under the sign of groove death metal. I like it. Overall, it's a good album, far more different and slower than the previous ones but also more obscure and intelligent if we want. It depends on the tastes\u2026I liked it as I loved Harmony Corruption.\n",
        "\nThis one\u2019s gonna be short. What did you expect? Seriously, how could anyone wax lyrical about finer aspects of Napalm Death without exposing himself as a pompous prick?\n\nSo, in a nutshell, what we\u2019ve got here is a collection of the four sessions that Napalm Death did for BBC Radio One between September 1987 and March 1996. The last one of these is not a \u201cproper\u201d Peel Session\u201d as the four tracks were recorded for Friday Rock Show. Incidently, they are the worst sounding ones and I choose to see them as lame bonus tracks I only listen to if, for some reason, I can\u2019t be bothered to get up and switch off the CD player. Not that it happens too often.\n\nOther than that, the CD is a must for any discerning grindcore fan ( a contradiction in terms? Yeah, whatever\u2026). If you consider \u201cScum\u201d and \u201cFrom Enslavement\u2026\u201d classics of the genre and don\u2019t know the first two Peel Sessions, it\u2019s\u2026.erm\u2026.just not on, man! Actually, all three are just perfect. You\u2019ll find they sound superbly and the band really delivers here \u2013 it feels as if they just weren\u2019t trying to prove anything and were actually enjoying punching you in the gob and kicking in the bollocks with each killer track. I may be thirty-four and generally jaded about many things but on a good day I will mosh erratically to this in my living room and get so psyched-up that I could kill any hapless soul that would interrupt my private Peel session.\n\nI love very much every aspect of the sound and instrumentation (cough\u2026) but if I were to single out anything it would have to be Mick Harris\u2019s drumming. He is a god, here tighter and more convincingly miked up and mixed than elsewhere with Napalm Death. Don\u2019t expect any virtuoso rubbish, just honest old-school grinding slaughter and you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\nWell, that\u2019s all you need to know about the release. Now go get it. Turn your amp up to eleven and start banging your head. No, I\u2019m not being funny. That\u2019s what you do.\n",
        "\nI never loved Scum because I always found it very chaotic and immature, even if I can consider it an innovation. Anyway in 1987 there were far better demos by Terrorizer or the first album by Unseen Terror (a bit more death/thrash). With the following From Enslavement To Obliteration the things would have been a bit more mature but still a bit chaotic. Only with this Harmony Corruption, Napalm Death began to be something I like\u2026and a lot, because I can easily consider this one as my favourite album in their discography. \n\nIn those years the principal genre was the growing death metal that, mixed with grind produced lots of masterpieces: World Downfall and Harmony Corruption among the others. And death metal itself contributes in giving this genre a more mature approach and songwriting. The grind influences are more brutal and filtrated through the heaviness of death.\n\nThe production is far better and pounding than in the past and Barney at vocals is an animal. His growls are always extreme but comprehensible and bad ass. The death metal influences can be found in the always not too fast \u201cMalicious Intent\u201d, with slow lead guitar lines and truly heavy tempo. The grind ones in the fist of \u201cInner Incineration\u201d: impact, violence and structured brutality. \n\nIn the massive \u201cUnfit Earth\u201d we have two special guests: John Tardy and Glenn Benton to do some screamed parts. The song is a good blend of fast grinding parts with up tempo parts and mid ones. Sometimes the death metal is so rooted in the group\u2019s skills that the blast beats parts have a brutal death metal style, without being so grind. \n\nIn \u201cCircle Of Hypocrisy\u201d you can truly hear the influences from Obituary in the sound. Very gloomy atmosphere, riffs and tempo changes. The guitar riffs on the grinding beginning to \u201cThe Chain That Bind Us\u201d come along with a black touch. \u201cMind Snare\u201d is awesome, one of the best here. Very catchy, fast with up tempo and truly evil riffage. \u201cSad dependency, brain fried society!!!! Jack Up!!!\u201d A good reflection about drugs. \n\n\u201cExtremity Retained\u201d is the shortest and the most violent here along with \u201cVision Conquest\u201d. Awesome in speed, tempo and vocals. Pure mosh!! \u201cSuffer The Children\u201d is very impressive for the double bass work and the grind break in the middle. The atmosphere is always growing in obscurity and suffocation. The riffs are heavy and so claustrophobic with lots of Obituary influences, especially in the mid paced tempo. \n\n\u201cHiding Behind\u201d is bonus track, excellent with his rotten, obscure beginning with an out of the blue grind part at 2:00. A perfect song to put an end to this album, starting a new path in Napalm Death music; a path made of good songwriting and more mature structures. Still their best.\n",
        "\nThis CD is flat out horrible. I hate every single little aspect about it, the only thing I find semi-tolerable is the drumming. I picked this up at a local store for 20$ and I wish I would have bought something else. It is a complete waste of money. And I wouldn't even download it off LimeWire, because it's not worth the time. Besides that I always buy albums anyway (musicians with talent gotta make money somehow, right?)\n\nLet's start off with the vocals. Monotonous, annoying, talent less, incomprehensible shouting. In the 20th Anniversary Edition of this disk (the one I own) there is a bonus DVD with \"The Scum Story\". On that DVD, it reveals the vocalist had to be cued in on every single song. How pathetic is that? \n\nThe guitars have heavy, yet catchy riffs, I will say that much. However, there is no talent in them at all! This is metal people! It HAS to be to get on the Archives! Metal has talent. Napalm Death does not. That's the simplest way to put it. These riffs are only power chords, that\u2019s it. There is no variation. Now, most of my favorite bands only use power chords for riffs, but they have solos. That\u2019s another thing I can't stand about this release. There are very, very few solos. Of the few that are there, I don't think a single one of them is over 5 seconds in length, and they are very basic.\n\nThe bass is completely inaudible, except in tracks like \"Scum\" which if I remember correctly, has a bass intro. Then the bassist uses very terrible distortion, completely killing the tone. He also uses a pick, destroying the sound even more. What was this guy thinking? The only way distortion sounds good on a bass is if Cliff Burton played it that way.\n\nThe drums are probably the best part of this release. Very fast and brutal, nice. This drummer is insane, but not the best I've heard. In the bonus DVD, they show him demonstrating a blast beat. He no longer even owns a kit and had not played for years, and somehow, this guy surpassed what most modern day drummers could do. This is the best part of the album along with the lyrics.\n\nThe lyrics are very political and convincing, they get their point across. I just wish I could understand them while the vocalist \u201csings\u201d them. I have no problem understanding Chris Barnes or George Fisher. \n\nWhat was this band thinking? Were they trying to make this album as short and terrible as they could? They have one track over three minutes. One of twenty-eight tracks is over three minutes in length! They have a song that one second long and then four seconds of silence. That's ridiculous. I hated this CD and I would never recommend this to anyone. Not even my worst enemy deserves that kind of torture. Whatever you do, do NOT buy this release.\n",
        "\nThis album is famous for a number of reasons some of which don't actually relate to the music itself. Certainly \"Scum\" was a forerunner of the grindcore scene and for a time drew public attention to a new generation of underground metal bands in the UK (and it helped that the late UK radio host John Peel was a fan of Napalm Death for a while). The album is also unusual in that two different band line-ups, each featuring people who became famous in other bands after leaving ND, play on the album: Side 1 features a line-up with a future member of Godflesh and Jesu (Justin Broadrick) and the musicians on Side 2 include future members of Carcass (Bill Steer) and Cathedral (Lee Dorrian), plus the only musician to feature on both sides, Mick Harris (or MJ Harris as he prefers to style himself these days) has since made a name for himself in experimental / dub / ambient music. The album cover which depicts reptilian corporate CEOs presiding over social, economic and physical destruction of human beings and the Earth was designed by Bill Steer's Carcass comrade Jeff Walker and the album itself addresses the theme of global domination by octopus-like corporations and the methods they and their friends in government and the commercial media use to keep people down, a theme that perhaps is more relevant to us now than it was 20 years ago when \"Scum\" was recorded.\n\nAside from all this interesting background info, what actually emerges in the way of music from \"Scum\" is a parade of strongly anarchic punk-influenced metal songs most of which are no longer than a minute or two and are hardly more than blasts of guitar anger and guttural roar. Other songs have basic riffs and melodies with maybe slightly more comprehensible lyrics and a rare guitar solo. On Side 1, the early songs go so fast and the singing can be such a blurry mess on most tracks that it's easy to get lost. Drumming consists of Harris mustering as much energy he can at once to bash the skins and foot pedals. Occasionally there'll be a diarrhoea guitar solo. The few recognisable songs include \"Multinational Corporations\" and everything from and including \"Siege of Power\" to the end: the singing becomes a lot clearer and the last 5 tracks on Side 1 have stronger and more regular riffs and melodies, though they can still collapse into fits of blast beat chaos. At the very end is the famous one-second wonder \"You Suffer\" in which everything that has gone before, lyrically speaking, gets pancaked into the short rhetorical question that is spat out in a roar. \n\nThe Side 2 songs are just as fast but are slightly different in that they sometimes have a dual vocal approach (Dorrian singing the lyrics and Harris helping out on garbled background vocals and screaming) and the standard of musicianship is a bit better with some songs actually having changes in rhythm and pace and Bll Steer managing to get in a frenzied fat-sounding lead guitar solo suggestive of burgeoning bacteria on \"Parasites\". Songs like \"Success?\", \"Stigmatized\" and \"M.A.D.\" have bouncy, almost danceable rhythms and it's clear from the energy on these tracks that the musicians enjoy each other's company.\n\nMusically the album is short on technical finesse and you could argue that if all the songs had been better written and had some real structure in the way of definite riffs and melodies, then the guys would have something to channel their energy and righteous anger with the result that their message would be more effective and hard-hitting and listeners would feel the anger and aggression coming out of the music. As it is, the emotion seems blocked and all over the place and unfocussed. With the songs being so short, there is not much scope for a guitarist with some talent like Bill Steer to prove his chops. But possibly the idea behind \"Scum\" was to create something that was anti-capitalistic and anarcho-punk in spirit and that might have meant doing away with \"capitalist\" music concepts such as melody and pacing and all the other things that make music amenable to listeners' preferences (which sometimes can be pretty narrow), therefore we have \"anti-music\" as well as \"anti-capitalist\" music. \n\nOverall the lyrics are more important than the actual music itself and I think this is very much in sync with Napalm Death having been more of an outlet for expressing a particular point of view and ideology about what music should be about, and changing people's perceptions of music composition.\n\nThis is obviously one of those recordings where the legend surrounding it is greater than the actual object that spawned it deserves but that's often the way with famous albums. I could take an example of a legendary album like Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon\" which is hugely famous and which a lot of people regard in awe: I find that a lot of the music on that record is really very ordinary, indulgent and forgettable, and the hoopla that's surrounded the album since its 1973 release just seems to get bigger and more out of control.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, before I begin let me say that I do also own Harmony Corruption. I do like that one better (on most days, at least), and I perfectly understand that Diatribes is not like older Napalm Death. In fact, it's a completely different kind of music. I'd call it groove/grind, or death/groove, or something. Anyway, onto the review.\n\nVocals- Barney whatever-his-name-is sounded better on Harmony Corruption. Here, he sounds like he's blown his vocal cords or something. That's not to say that he sounds bad, but his voice is one of many differences that you will find between this and anything else from Napalm Death. \n\nDrums- Yes, there are far less blastbeats on this album, and only 2-3 or so D-beats (I adore D-beats). Yes, there is more of a focus on slow/ midtempo beats. Oh well, some people like that. Besides, when you think about it, unless you're talking about blastbeats, a slower beat tends to be heavier than a faster one (think doom metal). In regards to the drumming aside from blastbeats and D-beats, the percussion is... not technical, no, not that but... unorthodox sounding, different. Also there is heavy use of toms here. I thought that was cool.\n\nGuitars/ Bass- Yes, the guitars are \"groove\" oriented and not really that much like traditional Napalm Death guitarwork. But it's not really like other typical groove metal bands; it's more akin to something like DevilDriver, but more modern rock-like (maybe if you like DevilDriver, you'll like this). Remember that despite this drastic change in style and musical approach, Napalm Death is still a death metal/ grind band. There were some songs that used an accoustic guitar or some kind of strange tuning. I guess that's not unheard of in death metal or groove metal, but it seems kind of strange here. When bass is audible, it is good, but kind of numetal-like. Some people might not like that, in fact they might hate it and destroy the blasphemy that is this album. Does anyone get the idea that this is like the death metal equivalent of numetal? Funny, huh...\n\nLyrics- Societal/ personal/ political. They're not bad lyrics in any respect, but they tend not to be very involved, lots of repetition of the same phrases over and over again. They're very interesting if you read the lyrics book. \n\nI agree with the last guy, buy an older Napalm Death album FIRST!!! I actually bought Diatribes before Harmony Corruption, and I listened to it and I said \"Where are all the blastbeats?!? I thought they were a grind band.\" So the next day I went back to the store and bought Harmony Corruption. It's not that Diatribes is bad, it's actually pretty decent, but in order to really appreciate it you must first be able to appreciate things like less blasting, slower tempos, groove metal, etc. If you like those things, you'll probably like this; if not, stick with more ordinary sounding death metal/ grindcore.\n\nRecommended tracks- 2, 3 (blastbeat), 6, 8 (blastbeat), 9 (beware of start/ stop guitarwork), 10 (blastbeat), 12\n",
        "\nI typically find a decent chuck of live albums to be very poor and redundant. After all, several factors can make or break a band\u2019s own show that most folks don\u2019t even consider, and from that comes the 50-50 chance of such a release kicking ass, or sucking like a black hole. Thankfully, my bi-annual stint in which I crave Napalm Death like a drug brought me to the group\u2019s loved live record entitled \u201cPunishment In Capitals.\u201d Intrigued by Napalm Death\u2019s legendary status and career, I picked it up, and wasn\u2019t disappointed by the wonderfully-produced plastic that brought every good quality of a live recording in full-circle. A great song list, awesome production, and spot-on playing are just small parts of what this great CD has within.\n\n\u201cPunishment In Capitals\u201d was recorded about twenty years after Napalm Death suited up for what would become their genre-defining sound. And with this special mark in the band\u2019s career, Napalm Death showcases a surprisingly-large set containing songs from every release at this point in time. Whether they\u2019re grinding through a collage of \u201cScum\u201d material or newer death metal tracks, Napalm Death keeps the track list enjoyable, unpredictable, and definitely fun to hear. After all, thirty tunes from the gods of grindcore should keep anyone entertained; if that doesn\u2019t, then the mini-solos, the various cover songs including \u201cNazi Punks Fuck off,\u201d and the Celtic Frost reference will. This here is a golden hour of slaughtering metal filled with an incredible list of tracks that will make any fan of Napalm Death faint, or jump for joy at the very least.\n\nLive recordings must meet a certain number of non-performance guidelines in order to be considered passable by the slightest degree; this includes several items, but production is by far the most important. \u201cPunishment In Capitals\u201d thankfully benefits from the wide scale of wonderful production this CD offers, mainly because each member brings his own set of cacophony to the table without coming off as a sloppy performance. Everything is clear and easy to here, yet one thing separates this baby from the rest: the utter rawness. Napalm Death is a group that lives for sounding rough, unpolished, and uncooked for the sake of originality, yet the group\u2019s chewy rareness is what builds up this record\u2019s content. It\u2019s like diving into a big, greasy burger knowing you\u2019ll get a bit messy, but love it nonetheless.\n\nAlas, Napalm Death manages to benefit from a strong overall performance. All thirty tunes are jacked with high doses of speed, flexibility, and comfort with the group\u2019s signature ripping riffs, Barney Greenway\u2019s low growls, and raw bass audio. The common death metal characteristic of playing fast is definitely something to expect, but the quick transitions between tracks is also something to take note of. Also, Barney doesn\u2019t hesitate pumping up the crowd by offering the coming tracks or just joking around with the fans. The entire band has all the attitude, charisma, skill, energy, and crowd interaction only a Napalm Death show could offer. \n\nBeing a fan of live CDs myself, I need to say \u201cPunishment In Capitals\u201d is definitely one of the better items available on the performance shelf. It sure is amazing to hear this legendary faction dish out tune after tune with ease, and without leaving any breathing room or gaps of excellence. Truly a disc you\u2019ll want to own if live records make you smile, or you have a place in your heart for Napalm Death.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m generally reluctant to play the part of philosopher when scrutinizing an album, of any kind, for review purposes. Though the lyricist may have a very specific point to drive home or a particular emotion to evoke from his carefully written lines, I still maintain the stance that any lyrical excellence is for naught if the instrumentation with which the words are coupled is tepid and uninteresting. I\u2019d like to believe that the average listener agrees with me, with evidence being that instrumental albums sell considerably better than spoken-word albums do. So no matter how compelling the lyrics are, I\u2019m never going to grant mercy upon a musically-flawed album. This leads me to my review of Napalm Death\u2019s Utopia Banished.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve always liked about Napalm Death are their lyrics. Since the band has grown from humble punk roots, they\u2019re socially-minded: an attribute that separates them from the brunt of death metal bands they\u2019d be endlessly compared to by the mid-90\u2019s. But unlike many of their grindcore contemporaries (or even many of their hardcore ones), Napalm Death were incredibly well-versed. This was beyond tongue-in-cheek ranting; this was futile, satirical poetry at a pace best described as blistering. Utopia Banished does not fail to deliver in this department; in fact, it might even be their masterwork. This is fatalism at its most cynical: ND crafting a not-so fictitious tale of humanity squandering in reckless abandon, at the mercy of our own social institutions. Reading along with this album was surprisingly engaging and even now I can look back on the album\u2019s lyrics with fondness. While this isn\u2019t a particularly unique emotion to have towards an album, it carries a certain weight when it\u2019s taken into consideration that I find the album musically unremarkable.\n\n\u201cDiscordance\u201d begins the album with 1:25 of static and distortion (oh lord, it\u2019s \u201cMeat Hook Sodomy\u201d all over again) before segueing into sonic crusher \u201cI Abstain.\u201d This track can be considered an archetype for the rest of the album because every other track insists on sounding just like it. There\u2019s a combination of thrash-like breaks, mid-tempo stomp riffs, and insanely fast grind passages, all of which feature the band playing at their full capacity. Barney Greenway then proceeds to roar the words over top, occasionally screaming them in a way that surely inspired a Bleeding-era Chris Barnes. This is a basic synopsis of \u201cI Abstain,\u201d as well as pretty much every other song on the album. Yeah, there\u2019s a few nice solo moments and a few notable memorable riffs that stick out in spite of the album\u2019s monotony, but otherwise this is a one-trick pony of sorts, pounding out a good message through a single dimensional wall of sound. I\u2019m not discrediting the band\u2019s musicianship; on the contrary, they navigate tempo changes and blazing riffage at an expert level. But their songwriting sucks to put it plainly, and I\u2019d have a hard time recalling any memorable passages outside of the first track or two. The bonus tracks on the reissue make it more difficult still, as they\u2019re no more striking than the rest. If you\u2019ve heard anything from the genre before, you\u2019ve heard this.\n\nGrindcore has never really been the best medium for expressing one\u2019s political discontent in a meaningful fashion. It works if you want to spout a bunch of surgical misanthropy or bludgeon your listener with rage, but it\u2019s not really the best genre for getting across a valid (and fundamentally serious) point. But maybe I\u2019d be singing a different tune if Utopia Banished wasn\u2019t so musically inept. Uncompromisingly heavy and fast, perhaps, but mindless nonetheless. And it\u2019s really a shame, because the lyrics are so damn good. Too bad the best lyrics in the genre couldn\u2019t keep this from tragic mediocrity.\n",
        "\nHere we have the ultimate Napalm Death collection. In the first disc you can find all the highlights of their career. ''Suffer the children'', ''Scum'', every ''hit'' is included. It's good that the band didn't stick in their old grind albums but included also their more ''modern'' songs as ''Greed killings'' and ''Diatribes''. So you can really understand the evolution of this terrific band and its fantastic quality, both in the grindcore and the death metal songs. The only bad ponit for me is that ''Siege of power'' is not in its original form but with Barney in the vocal duties. Oh, and it was wise that the band included ''Nazi punks fuck off'', their fantastic Dead Kennedys cover.\n\nThe second disc is really Napalm Death's fan paradise! Firstly we have the whole ''Mentally murdered'' E.P., my favourite album from this band. It's really difficult to find it nowadays in its original form, so I thank God that they included it here! Apart from that, you can find a lot of unrealased and rare stuff. A live jamming with Godflesh (yes!), studio recordings with Lee Dorrian and Bill Steer, even live recordings back from 1986! \n\nSo, here's something for everyone. The first disc is a perfect best of for somebody who had never heard Napalm Death before, and the second disc goes to all those who want to have everything from their favourite band.\n",
        "\nA lot of things have been said about \"Scum\" by Napalm Death. Some more true than others, but as it stands, this is a very fine grindcore album, though not deserving of most of the credit or praise it gets.\n \nThe music defines the early Earache sound. Exceptionally metallic grindcore (at the time) that has been copied to death, from Japan to the USA. What made the album so revolutionary and different than other music at the time wasn't the fact that it was grindcore (which was played before by punk legends like L\u00c3\u00a4rm, Cyanamid and Fear Of God), but its mysterious metal crossover appeal.\n\nThe production was crap, the vocals were shouted and shrieked and the guitars sound like a muddy mess, with the most of the guitarplaying in mid-speed over the frenzied and well-executed blastbeats. The only break from the insanity are the occasional thrash metal riffs and the slow sludge of the title track's intro.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, it's a very good record and definitely recommended if you want to widen your horizons in extreme music, but the formula has been done better before and after, even by blatant copy cats such as Insect Warfare or Unholy Grave. However, if this isn't what you're looking for, don't hesitate to look for other grindcore records, the genre has much more and better things to offer than this.\n",
        "\nThis was where ND took it to the next level musically and proceeded to \"go metal\" on us all. I rather liked it at the time and still enjoy this album quite a lot even though it features the de rigeur for the time mushy Scott Burns \"production\" style. The guitars overwhelm the bass in typical metal fashion except for a little burst here and there and the drums are not very defined at all in the mix, and the vocals are a tad low in the mix, but otherwise this is still listenable. And this is still a mighty kick in the nads and to the head musically to say the least. Were you expecting any less than that from ND?\n\nAfter an intro of radio static, the grind crashes in with walls of furious guitars and drums, and Barney wastes little time announcing his presence with one of his trademark \"Kam Lee blowouts\", a mighty bellow that showed us all from the get-go he was a more than adequate replacement for Lee Dorrian. \"If The Truth Be Known\" showcases his Tom G. Warrior impersonation with hearty \"OOGH!\" grunts and runs the gamut from a slow (!) intro to a midpaced headbanging beat and an irresistable riff that makes me pull out ye olde air guitar. A tasty and otherworldly little guitar lead takes us out of this one courtesy of the late Jesse Pintado. \"Unfit Earth\" is another one that starts midpaced and gets a good headbanging groove going and features backing vocals from both John Tardy and Glen Benton (Tardy sounds more convincing and appropriate to their sound, though). \"Suffer The Children\" is a fave of mine that runs the gamut again tempo-wise froim midtempo to speedy thrash and the usual blasting madness. There's still lots of blasting on this album, but in a more refined (dare i say it) manner that shows they'd gotten their heads around the concept of writing songs as opposed to furious blasts of noisy brutality.\n\nMick Harris actually got his act together impressively for this album and tightened up a LOT on the drum front and the songs benefit from his additional drum prowess. Even though he was a right asshole when I met him on the tour accompanying this album, he deserves mention for \"Most Improved\" player on this album. Mitch Harris and Jesse Pintado contributed a new style of riffing, a more metallic style that featured more technical ability and structure, but still had the go for the throat intensity ND were/are known for. Leads are minimal--in fact, I think the only one is at the end of \"If The Truth be Known\" and they don't play it live anyway so it doesn't matter. Shane Embury rumbles away with his trademark filthy fuzz bass, supplying the Godzilla-like low end that powered ND's sound. Barney, however, is the star of this album with his guttural bellows and grunts, showing that Lee Dorrian's shoes were easily filled. And in fact, I think he was/is even better than Dorrian.\n\n\"Harmony Corruption\" is far from unworthy. In fact, in my opinion, it was the last really great ND album before they lost their focus for a while and branched out into too many odd directions that diluted the power and impact of their music. It is well worth hunting down and adding to the collection, if you ask me, so don't pass it up.\n",
        "\nI am not really into grindcore, but this one is exceptional. Not like ordinary grindcore - damned lot of noise and growls without melody - this one is more melodic. Let\u00b4s take a look at an example: guitar riff from \u201cWhen All is Said and Done\u201c in the beginning of the song and during the chorus. It\u00b4s adding to this album more melodic sound reminding me of death metal. This is what makes it different from other bands. \n\nAnd now for the story how I got this album. When I was in the shop, I hesitated because they had the normal CD and the limited edition digipak (including 2 bonus tracks and a sticker; it was also more expensive.) I decided to buy the special edition even though it was my first album from Napalm Death and, as I said, I am not into grindcore. I don\u2019t regret buying this one, though. \n\nEverything about the music is already written in the booklet and on the limited edition paper CD case: \nBarney \u2013 shouting, screaming, swans, sermons \nShane \u2013 four strings of apocalypse / NY aggro lung assault \nMitch \u2013 shredding, grinding, subliming noise / shrill cries \nDanny \u2013 blast beat terrorism \n\nSo prepare for 45 minutes and 2 seconds of growling, shredding, blast beats, and, of course, four strings of apocalypse. I especially like those shrill cries in the beginning of \u201cIn difference\u201c and \u201cSink fast, Lets go\u201c, where Mitch releases one shrill cry for few seconds in \u201cAs Always, the Will and Desire\u201c and the another one for \u201cPassed Off as a Fault of the Unlearned\u201c, but without the booklet, I thought at first that he was only shrieking. I then found out these noises are meant to be phrases with meaning. \n\nThe music is extremely violent and fast, the growls are pitched low, and riffs are simple, but well played. Some of them haunt your head for next few hours, like the one from \u201cWhen All is Said and Done\u201c. And as for the two bonus songs on the special edition, \u201cCall That an Option?\u201c is as good as the other songs on this album and the final track \u201cAtheist Runt\u201d is a six minute long track repeating the few lines of text over and over with catchy guitar melodies. After hearing the whole album I found myself singing to my brother to make him angry \u2013 \u201cRestrain this runt, neutralize this runt, behead this runt amid pillars of salt\u201c over again and again. This definitely rests in your head. \n\nIt\u2019s a great album - fast, heavy and violent. My favorite songs: \u201cSing Fast, Let\u2019s Go\", \u201cIn Difference\u201c, \u201cWhen All is Said and Done\u201c, and \u201cPersona Non Grata\u201c.\n",
        "\nI know, I know! Napalm Death are probably the most popular grindcore band of all time! They've been hailed as the creators of grindcore and that Scum is the best grindcore album ever! Well, I say no way! After hearing this EP, I can safely say Napalm Death have become one of the more average grind/death bands. \n\n\nLeaders Not Followers is a cover album, part one in a series of two albums. Leaders Not Followers part. II, however, is an album, Leaders Not Followers part. I being an EP. This albums has covers of Death, Slaughter, Pentagram, Dead Kennedys, Raw Power and Repulsion. All great bands! The only thing that's bad about it is, well, Napalm Death are covering them.\n\n\nYes, yes... I know Napalm Death are a good band, but this album is nothing short of boring and dull. I was glad it was only 6 songs or I'd have never bought it in the first place. It's not it's bad beacuse Napalm Death are covering, it's because almost every song sounds the same, no matter how different the bands they're covering are.\n\n\nAll I can say is, what were Napalm Death thinking when they released this? The songs are boring, the drums sound horrible and everything just drags on and on and on. The guitars and vocals are done fairly well, but that's me in a good mood.\n\n\nI would not recommend buying this at all and I'm sure anyone who likes Napalm Death would agree with me. Just buy Scum and go from there.\n",
        "\nUp until this point Napalm Death had been known as the infamous inventers of Grindcore (which is debateable), playing \u201cone minute songs\u201d and generally flushing the concept of song structure down the toilet. However with Harmony Corruption they began to change their style playing more death metal than Grindcore They added new vocalist Barney and guitarists Jesse Pintado (R.I.P.) and Mitch Harris after Lee Dorrian and Bill Steer quite to follow their own musical directions. The end result cannot really be called pure Death Metal instead its kind of a mixture of Death Metal and Grindcore. \n\nThe main notable change to Harmony Corruption is the song length, no songs are shorter than 2 minutes and the longest being over 5 minutes, much to the disgust of any Grindcore purest. The production is a lot more professional sounding than Scum or FETO as ND could actually afford a \u2018decent\u2019 production job. However it is the production that is my main gripe with album (as previous reviewers have noted), it will probably take The sound is too muddy and undefined, the drums have quite a strange sound with the snare ringing out very loudly, the toms are deep and thundering and the bass drum is fairly clicky. Shane Embury\u2019s bass guitar seems to have been unfortunately almost completely forgotten in the mixing. The guitar tone is probably the thickest Napalm Death have ever had, however the whirring Grind riffs that are played during the blast sections sometimes sound perilously thin and weak, which leads me on to the riffs. \n\nThe Guitar work on Harmony Corruption is mainly composed of 2 types of riffs, heavy crushing Thrash riffs such as the intro to Unfit Earth and whirring Grind riffs that are usually played during the blast beats, this creates the mix between Death Metal and Grindcore sound the album has. Both Guitarist bring their own approaches to riffing on the album and it really works adding another dimension to ND\u2019s sound. Micky Harris\u2019 drumming has improved enormously since his Scum days where his drumming couldn\u2019t extend much beyond blast beating the hell of the kit.\nOn Harmony Corruption his blasting is controlled and far more accurate without losing any speed, his fills brim with confidence and are extremely fast, he has also mastered the use of double bass, something that wasn\u2019t present on Scum or FETO. Shane Embury\u2019s bass playing is excellent but as already stated the bass is unfortunately very quiet in the mix. Last but not least I come to Barney\u2019s vocal performance, quite simply he is one of the best Death Metal vocalists ever. His vocals are infinitely better than Lee Dorrian\u2019s work as he has a truly monstrous growl that retains audibility, allowing you to actually hear what he is growling. \n\nThe lyrics of the album are in the traditional vein of ND\u2019s socio political themes, condemning the way people and governments act in the world but there are even some lyrics about the music itself (extremity retained). \n\nAlbum highlights would have to be If The Truth Be Known and the classic Suffer The Children. Other great songs include Unfit Earth (which has backing vocals from Glen Benton and John Tardy) The Chains That Bind Us and Circle Of Hypocrisy. \n\nThis album is an excellent work of Death/Grind and is worthy of being in every extreme metal album collection.\n",
        "\nI really hate to see this happen. When a good band releases a mediocre live album. I have seen it happen to many bands. And once again I see it happen, this time to Napalm Death.\n\n\nThis album suffers from a few things. The main reason I think is that this album has a really bad selection of songs. It's really too bad that this album came out in Napalm Death's weakest period. They had just released \"Diatribes\" which was pretty bad. And of course when a band has a new album out they are going to play a lot of songs off that album at live shows. So on this album there is a lot of songs off the disappointment that was \"Diatribes\". Also, for some reason they played barely anything off of \"Harmony Corruption\" which is arguably there best album.\n\n\nThe best stuff on the album is when they play the older stuff. Everything they do from there Grindcore period is played really well. \"Life?\" is played really well, and \"From Enslavement to Obliteration\" and \u201cScum\u201d are just as good. Probably the best song on the album is \"Suffer the Children\". They play it with so much energy and anger.\n\n\nThe production on the album isn't half bad. It is a little flat at times, but that doesn\u2019t bother me all that much. Overall the production is a little above average. This is weird seeing as this album was originally a bootleg. \n\n\nOverall this is an okay album. It has some very weak parts, but there are some definite strong parts as well. If you are a big Napalm fan it is worth picking up, but if not it is worth maybe $6.\n",
        "\nMost everything has already been said, but some of this bears repeating: Scum, albeit incredibly raw, epitomizes everything good about grindcore. This entire album is a work of incredibly fast and aggressive sonic mayhem. The speed and intensity of Napalm Death on this recording (which is actually two separate sessions, one in late '86 and one in early '87) still is rarely matched today by most bands; it puts all of their speedy hardcore punk and thrash contemporaries of the mid-eighties to shame.\n\nSimply playing fast, of course, is not what is amazing about this album; any artist with enough practice can play at fast tempos. The amazing thing is how they manage to weave the speed with their incredibly raw production and instrumental sound (which in my opinion is when grindcore sounds best). The album is not polished, but still very audible, even to picky listeners. The actual instrumental sound is very raw, adding further to the intensity of the music. \n\nBlastbeating drums thud throughout the entire album, which unfortunately sometimes drown out the guitars. Despite this, the heavy insane drumming makes the perfect grindcore atmosphere, complete with frantic riffs and the occasional slowed down parts, such as before the verses in \"Scum,\" or in \"Siege of Power.\"\n\nOverall, this album is a completely amazing work of raw, lightning fast, wild grindcore that has to be listened to to be believed. Amazing, amazing album, 100%.\n",
        "\nIn their previous album The Code is Red... Long Live The Code the band took a big step towards more punkier style and they continue to do the same thing in their new album, Smear Campaign. It has that typical Napalm Deathish groove and aggression but this time with even more variety in- and between songs than their previous recording. Length of this album (little bit over 45 minutes) is in most cases too much for a grind (or deathgrind) band but it's a little bit surprising that Smear Campaign doesn't really sound boring although it has some parts that come close to the line of what is boring and what is not.\n\nIf you listen to songs like In Deference, Shattered Existence or Persona Non Grata, your legs will begin moving uncontrolled and your head will move in the rhytm of the music and these songs are amongst the catchiest songs in this album. It seems that guitarist Mitch Harris gets more and more vocal parts after every album, and Smear Campaign doesn't make an exception. Nevertheless, his high screeching that resembles something close to someone killing a cat supports Barney's growling pretty seamlessly.\n\nIt is becoming clear that Napalm Death is going back to its roots although I think that they go back to their more death metal sound sometime soon. This album is very good and hard-hitting even if it isn't better than Napalm Death's first two albums. Jesse Pintado would be proud of this album...\n",
        "\nNapalm Death have dominantly established themselves as a household name with avid grindcore and death metal enthusiasts, using a perfect mix of the two genres in nearly every release they've put out to date. From their hardcore punk beginnings to their continual stranglehold on the world of deathgrind, they have never lost grasp of their roots and continue to utilize both dated and current methods to ultimately achieve their goals. One of the cornerstones for this near transcendence of genres would have to be the classic album \"Harmony Corruption\". \n\nFrom blistering start to lumbering finish, \"Harmony Corruption\" weaves a dark tail of political dissension, the likes of which would make Michael Moore blush. Every track leads us in a different direction via impetuous droning of guitars and a subversive vocal assault by our favorite Flinstones character. The opening into to \"Vision Conquest\" has us adjusting our radio settings with a crackly radio frequency buzzing before jolting into the guitar leads followed by a signature bellowing wail from Barney. It's with this first song we really see their Death Metal influence take hold, utilizing an overlaying melody of a high velocity scale ascent and decent, and some nice riff patterns near the latter portion of the song. The next song \"If the Truth Be Known\", my personal favorite on the album, gives us more traditional Napalm Death up and down grinding as we know it. The opening intro of mid paced guitars backed against some nice varying drum lines gives us a great lead in to one of the most powerful words ever exclaimed in Death Metal history...\"RUUAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRGHH!!!!!!\" Thus ends one of the greatest opening shouts ever leaving us with profound understand why Greenway is so beloved as a vocalist.\n\nThroughout the album, the blistering low to mid scaled guitar droning is a dominant feature. Here and there, the guitars will slow down into more of a grinding thrash section that mosh monkey's dream about. The first part of \"Unfit Earth\" exemplifies this with some great crunching riffage to bang your head to before disappearing in a sea of blazing low tuned grindcore horrors. The oft covered \"Suffer the Children\" is by far the most groove driven grindcore track on the album. Beginning with a quick roll of the drums and melding into some of the finest guitar work seen out of Mitch Harris and the late Jesse Pintado collectively. The drumming on this particular song could not be done any better from the opening roll cycling into furious bass hits interspersed with a fast paced assault on the wrists from the snares. The quartet of instruments mesh perfectly at that critical second before that well known riff section kicks in giving us that classic thirty or so seconds of headbanging tunes.\n\nThe reason I left out poor Shane from my review was because the jolly chap was nearly completely drowned out in the muddy production which, consequentially, was the only drawback that this album contained. Besides that all too common \"black hole bass\" production mishap, this album almost completely annihilated all negative perceptions of deathgrind in the early 90's. While politically, I most always disagree with the rantings of Napalm Death, I commend the fact that it provides that fuel and animosity to produce albums such as \"Harmony Corruption\". Any avid Death Metal or Grindcore enthusiast could not consider his collection and life complete, without owning and listening to this monumental album.\n",
        "\n\u201cFear, Emptiness, Despair\u201d was the first Napalm Death album that disappointed me. On that album the band really started to move away from their traditional grindcore sound. Instead they started to add dull mid-tempo and groove parts to their music. This evolution continues on \u201cDiatribes\u201d. Here the band are moving even further away from what I consider to be \u201cNapalm Death\u201d and I\u2019m not pleased at all. My question is, where the hell is the grindcore? It\u2019s certainly not here! A Napalm Death album consisting of twelve tracks out of which only three contain blast parts is ridiculous \u2013 it\u2019s simply not \u201cNapalm Death\u201d. Seems the band got really tired of grindcore at this point in their career and wanted to experiment by writing slower stuff. Well, it didn\u2019t work, not for me at least. This stuff is really boring and totally lacks extremity. The groovy mid-tempo parts abound and the riffing is many times as average as can be. Many of the songs are also too long and start to drag seriously. This pisses me off even more. I bet many mallcore kids would love to jump around to these groovy riffs but this is not what I want to hear from a band called Napalm Death. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s not only the music that sucks here, also the vocals suck. On \u201cDiatribes\u201d Barney\u2019s vocals really annoy me. Yeah, his grunting has always been monotonous but on this album it sounds so one-dimensional it hurts (and no, the fact that they use clean vocals on some tracks doesn\u2019t help matters at all). The only tracks that I like on this album are \u201cGreed Killing\u201d and \u201cCold Forgiveness\u201d. On the first one the groovier approach actually works and the latter is more of a darker and experimental song with an ominous feel to it. The rest leaves me cold though and in my opinion \u201cDiatribes\u201d is easily one of the worst Napalm Death albums. However, if heavy\u2019n\u2019groovy metal with grunted vocals spiced with occasional blast beats sounds like your thing, \u201cDiatribes\u201d might be a good purchase. If you\u2019re a newcomer to Napalm Death, I suggest you check out albums like \u201cFrom Enslavement to Obliteration\u201d, \u201cHarmony Corruption\u201d, \u201cUtopia Banished\u201d and \u201cOrder of the Leech\u201d first. These will give you a much better idea of what Napalm Death are about musically.\n",
        "\nWhere to start off? Well, being a fan of early Napalm Death, I was very happy to see with Enemy of the Music Business that they decided to revisit the genre they, along with greats such as Repulsion, Extreme Noise Terror, etc.., spawned!\n\nThe first track (an intro) makes you wonder what exactly Napalm has in store for their fans\u2026Then \"Sink Fast, Let Go\", the second track, tears through the speakers with simple riffs and blast beats galore! Napalm definitely went back to the old days covering the entire album in blast beats and, much like the old days with Mick and Lee, high-pitched shrieks delivered by both Barney and Mitch! You can even hear some of Shane's voice in the back at times! (Listen to the Offenders cover they did on Leaders..Part II and you'll see what I mean! \n\nThe Code is Red..., their previous effort, was very good and was a step towards returning to the days of Dorrian and Lee. I think this album is what Harmony Corruption should've been, instead of the more death metal sound they went for. The production is excellent, very much like Code.., and much catchier too! Definitely not for fans of Greed Killing n' Words From the Exit Wound n' what not...\n\nFavorite Tracks: Sink Fast, Let Go ; Freedom is a Wage of Sin [dig the chorus!!] ; Short Lived; Deaf and Dumbstruck (Intelligent Design)\n",
        "\nThe undisputed kings of Grindcore return with another round of utter grinding insanity here on \u201cThe Code Is Red\u2026Long Live The Code\u201d. Over the course of the past 24 years, Napalm Death has symbolized the epitome in extreme music and continues to do so today. No other band has yet managed to capture the intensity and original sound that Napalm Death deliver, but make no mistake, ND are an act that has set the benchmark for extreme music throughout the course of their career and on this album, the band continues to do so. \n\nBarney Greenway's unmistakable voice is instantly recognizable as he tears into \u201cSilence Is Deafening\u201d with ripping growls and his trademark high pitched screams. The production work on this release does much to bring back the feelings contained in the band\u2019s classic recordings. \n\nMitch Harris continues to be a monster con the six string, delivering lightening paced hardcore riffing that causes the group\u2019s material to have a feel that is manic and chaotic at one moment, then massively doomish at another. He is one of the most overlooked and underrated axe men out there, and he proves exactly why on this record time and time again. \u201cRight You Are\u201d is a feverish fifty two second burst of grind that launches right into \u201cDiplomatic Immunity\u201d, yet another track that evokes the feeling of the band\u2019s earlier recordings, while maintaining an updated feeling with the inclusion of a bit more hardcore sounding rhythms. \n\nGreenway sets off the title track with a cool belch of discontent as the band wails away at a rapid pace. Perhaps the most intriguing thing about the group\u2019s music is their uncanny ability to take song parts of contrasting styles and meld them into a singular unique sound that is without a doubt, truly all their own. As always, the band\u2019s message carries a political theme that lashes out at governments and systems on songs like the title track and \u201cClimate Controllers\u201d with an inspired vehemence. On \u201cInstruments Of Persuasion\u201d, the band moves between chunking rhythms and blasts of grind that are focused, relentless bursts of pure power. \n\nDrummer Danny Herrera attacks his drum set like a madman, churning out speedy flurries and crushing downbeats with effortless precision. \u201cAll Hail The Grey Dawn\u201d is highlighted by the off tempo axe work of Harris, as Greenway delivers stringent, upfront vocals that are truly magnificent. Shane Embury continues to be one of the greatest bass players in extreme metal, issuing thunderous sounds that serve as the backbone of Napalm Death, tearing away at his instrument with devastating fury.\n\nThroughout the album, the group never lets up, continuing an awe-inspiring pace for the course of the album that is nothing short of amazing. Special guests on the record include Jello Biafra, Jeff Walker and the omnipresent Jamey Jasta. Long time fans of this legendary act will no doubt delight in this record, which is easily the group\u2019s most consistently brilliant effort since \u201cFrom Enslavement To Obliteration.\u201d\n",
        "\n\"Smear Campaign\" is album number 12 from Napalm Death and it's good to see they can still lead the grindcore/death metal scene after nearly 20 years since their first album. This new album is brutal as fuck. A complete onslaught of relentless riffs, blastbeats and a combination of high pitched wailing vocals and Barney Greenway's trademunk grunts. \n\nThis album doesn't add too much new to the Napalm Death sound, nor does it take anything away from it. This is one of the heaviest albums I have heard them perform so far, and its a lot of fun for a while, but many of the tracks seem to just blur into each other. With so many releases it may be difficult for this to be a stand out album in their long discography. \"Smear Campaign\" doesn't have as much range of ideas as the last album, which was one of the Napalm Death's best moments of their whole career. It's easy to see \"Smear Campaign\" as the same song written over and over. \n\nThere are however, stand out tracks to be found here. \"Sink Fast, Let Go\" is a brutal onslaught which sets the standards of this album, whilst \"In Deference\" experiments with female vocals from guest vocalist from The Gathering. The track \"Rabid Wolves (For Christ)\", is smart and punky, throwing back to their earlier grindcore sound. \n\n\"Smear Campaign\" is nothing more than the next Napalm Death release really. It isn't a standout album, yet nor is it a stinker. This album is somewhere in the middle, and sounds like a heavier, better produced \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\" in some respects. The last album, \"The Code is Red... Long Live the Code\" was an essential Napalm Death purchase, whilst \"Smear Campaign\" is more for fans only and not an album I would instantly recommend. \n\n* Bonus track \"Call That An Option?\" is a well good addition to the album, whilst \"Atheist Runt\" just sounds too similar to last years closing track \"Morale\", which is a slower and longer track, almost with a hint of doom metal in it.\n",
        "\nThe Promo Clips\n\nTo start out the dvd we have some of the promo clips that Napalm came out with during their earache era. There\u2019s some interesting footage in these promo clips, especially on \u201cBreed to Breathe.\u201d However, I notice that some videos such as Mass Appeal Madness are a little choppy. But other than that, these clips are pretty interesting.\n\nLive Corruption\n\nLive Corruption is an awesome show, an excellent choice of songs and clips of Napalm really shredding. Anyone who owns the cd remembers the drunks crying out at Shane Embury \u201cFat Bastard,\u201d well here you\u2019ll notice that between songs will be interviews with the band and it cuts that crap out (I think it\u2019s crap anyway.) The only problem is that the sound quality is so quiet compared to the loud promo clips that were on just before the show. Other than that it\u2019s a great show.\n\n\u201989 Show\n\nThis show is somewhat boring. There\u2019s some good songs on it, but nothing really happens. It is interesting to see Napalm\u2019s recovery from the departure of Steer and Dorrian. If you look on the side of the stage you can occasionally see Mitch Harris who has yet to join the band at this point. This clip is good for the history.\n\nRock Show\n\nI love this. The sound quality isn\u2019t that great, but hearing Lee\u2019s roaring voice echo across the audience as Embury, Harris and Steer tear shit up is just amazing. Unfortunately they only play two songs! \u201cYou Suffer\u201d and \u201cScum.\u201d As they finish you suffer you can even hear Dorrian say \u201cMentally Murdered.\u201d But after that it cuts the rest of the show out. Earache has deprived us of an excellent show! They truly are the Enemy of the Music Business.\n",
        "\nIt is surely not the \"identity crisis\" and not \"all is said and done\". Napalm Death know exactly who they are and what they were created for - to spill aggression everywhere they are. Guitar is still devastating and Barney still spits the words with inhuman fury. Hatred lives in the band as it did those years ago and time doesn't bring any release. Actually, \"Smear Campaign\" is no doubt much more aggressive than the previous recordings. It would be an overstatement to claim this is Napalm Death's return to the grind, but that's better - I believe the band is not able to record \"Scum\" once again and it's fantastic to hear a band changing a bit even after more than two decades of continous activity.\n\n\"Smear Campaign\" is a real chest of riffs and this always makes a metalhead childishly joyful. The sound hardly changed but the album seems different. These are the indisputable achievements of Napalm Death anno 2006 and I really wish this chase for freshness and being up-to-date would never stop. I also hope that I will admit that \"this is the best Napalm Death album\" every time I listen to a new record from the English masters of extreme music. Judging from the discography, the next opportunity comes next year.\n",
        "\nNapalm death are supposedly returning to their grindcore roots with this album after a few grinding death records so when i bought this album i was a little apprehensive as to whether they know what grindcore is anymore, however as soon as the i pressed the play button and track 2 kicked in \"Sink Fast, Let Go\" is Napalm Death at their incendiary grindcore best. One of the things that stands out most about this release is the amount of backing vocals used. The last few albums have used the backing vocalist sparingly at most but in this they utilize the fact that they have 2 immense vocalists compared to just Barney (who by the way sounds angrier than ever on this release).\nThis is an album i can really enjoy and Napalm Death havent slowed down a single beat. Yeah there is a couple of melodic vocal bits in there like from Morale off the code is red but they dont over do them. Dont Worry, they dont use the melodic vocals too often, however it does add a different twist to the normal Napalm Death formula.\n\nSo in short this album shows that not only are napalm death still one of the angriest and feral bands around, but their still better than most of these young bands that are trying to plug into the grindcore sound these days.\n\nBring on the UK tour!!\n",
        "\nOkay okay okay! So it's already obvious that Napalm Death's \"Scum\" is hailed as the first true grindcore release ever... but does that make it so \"Godly?\"\n\nIt seems like many people praise this album as the best grindcore release only because it was the first known grindcore release. I must say that this isn't the best grindcore around; although for it's time, this was extreme but even back then, if I was to hear this album as a raging angst teen in the mid-80's, I'm sure I still would've been kind of turned off to the album. A lot of it has to do with the bands attempt at trying to be the most brutal band of the time and the musicianship.\n\nI do like Napalm Death, but I honestly don't like this CD. It's not really catchy, not so memorable, not spectacular; wait, I take that back; it's spectacular in the sense of actually hearing one of the first attempts at making \"schizo\" music. Other than that, the production on the first half of the CD reeks of shit (the first half is actually the demo I know but it could've been mastered better) while the other half of the CD has much more decent production but still not the best song writing.\n\nThat's the weird about this release, it has two distinct sides. The first half of it is the demo part that Napalm Death recorded and released independently featuring Justin K. Broadrick and Nik Bullen on strings. Justin I know never was a fan of being apart of the \"grindcore\" movement and despised the word. With this in mind, I must also add that he wasn't the best guitarist for fast paced music; Godflesh is his homecoming because his attempt at playing stellar hardcore punk riffs never worked out. For the most part then, Justin wrote the music with Mick Harris (drums) on the first half of the CD and did I mention how much of a maniac Mick is on drums? For something in the 80's, this was fucking extreme because of his unique drumming style (at the time of course.) \n\nSome songs which could've been good but failed because of musicianship are songs like \"Instinct of Survival\" because the drumming and attempt at playing fast guitar altogether just didn't seem to work out and Lee Dorian (vocals) sounds more like he's barking with a sore throat rather than barking with a growl sound. Throughout the first half, Lee sounds like this and it's not the best vocal performance either. I like it better when he sounds like he's actually growling rather than half assed sore throat rasps. On the other hand, some standout songs are the immediate showstoppers \"The Kill\" for it's intensity and sting after it's done within 23 seconds, and also the classic \"You Suffer\", which has to be one of the most innovative songs played and why you ask? Well, it's no more than 3 seconds long and that should seem retarded to many of you, but think about it: a song that is 3 seconds long? Who would have ever thought? It's definitely not a sing-a-long song (try screaming \"You suffer... but why?\" fast!) but it's just one of those \"wow, what the hell\" songs. \"Siege of Power\" is a song on the album which comes close to being the thrashiest track here as well as probably the longest, spanning over 3 minutes and actually having a chorus line as opposed to every other \"blast\" of a track and oh yeah, there's no blast beats on this track either. It's not the best song here but it's worth mentioning that it's different from the rest of the whole album.\n\nThe other half of this release features Bill Steer (guitar) of the soon to be Carcass fame as well as Jim Whitely (bass) of Ripcord fame. Even though the production is far better on this side of the album, it still isn't so memorable of a listen. Bill was born to play music this fast as opposed to Justin because his riffs are top notch and can play in temp with the blast beats... Justin couldn't really do that so well as I mentioned. The blast beats and guitar playing working hand in hand with one another. Still, the music on this half seems kind of \"empty\" or it's missing something\u2026 it's missing energy! As opposed to the other half of this CD, this side doesn't have such great and raw energy. It sounds very monotonous and bland... but at least the music work is tighter as I mentioned. \n\nSuch memorable songs here are \"Deceiver\", which the opening riff kind of grabs you and leaves you in blast beat oblivion and Lee's (better) vocal performance with his growling. It's a riff playing over and over to a blast beat with Lee's voice echoed through the song like he was some ghost in the studio. I can't think of any other song really worth mentioning from this side because nothing else seems to stand out like \"Deceiver\" does.\n\nWhile this may be the first grindcore release ever, it isn't the greatest. Things that begin usually start very rusty and progressively get better. As with most things that start, grindcore as well as Napalm Death would sound and get better and, as with any art, you have to learn to perfect what you're doing. Hence I'm not trying to negatively degrade this album at all but I am pointing out that Napalm Death will get better and this \"grindcore\" music will become more interesting than the music here. I'm merely saying in short that this is legendary and very novelty to listen to, but it's not recommended for a intro to grindcore music or what Napalm Death sound like. \n\n\"Scum\" just presents a movement of a new kind within the extreme music world... and its birth date was on this very album... it's just came out prematurely let\u2019s say.\n\n\nEar Candy: You Suffer, The Kill, Siege of Power, Deceiver...\n",
        "\nAfter blowing the rules of punk and metal apart with their debut album Scum, Napalm Death were back in short order to do what some thought was the impossible: produce an encore to the apocalypse. But lo and behold, the band, now with extra added bassist Shane Embury (who\u2019d formerly recorded with Unseen Terror) did their debut one better, by virtue of experience, both on their part and of their still fledgling record company, who were quickly gaining ground as bastions of extreme music on a global scale. \n\n\nPrimarily, the production is was ahead of the debut, balancing the drums, which threatened to consume the whole aural picture previously, and pushing up Lee Dorrian\u2019s wails and Embury\u2019s fuzzy bass high in the mix. And somewhere in there Bill Steer (co-currently recording with his other band Carcass) churns out riff after riff of sonic goo. Also, the songs boast somewhat meatier, more metallic riffs, as Napalm Death begin their slow and steady but ultimately short lived journey to the frontiers of death metal. \u201cUnchallenged Hate\u201d is perhaps the best thing on hand with its weighty structure, although the opening semi-industrial dirge of \u201cEvolved As One\u201d is a striking piece as well. But then, this is Napalm Death, and plenty of brief and formidable hyper-speed blasts appear in abundance, with \u201cPrivate Death\u201d and \u201cDisplay To Me\u201d coming out on top of that heap. More fortress-weight tunes are in attendance, as the title song and \u201cMentally Murdered\u201d make evident, and the band\u2019s growth as players make them indeed a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\nIn a sense, From Enslavement To Obliteration has taken a big back seat to Scum in historical terms, which is a real shame. Almost twenty years on, the band perform a bevy of songs from this recording live, and in terms of extremity few subsequent releases (both by Napalm Death and their legions of imitators) can hold a candle to it. The good news is that Earache has (sporadically) issued both albums on one CD! Pretentious record collectors note: the original vinyl pressing came with a bonus seven inch single containing five cuts, one of which (\u201cThe Curse\u201d) is pretty dang hard to find in any other form.\n",
        "\nWe didn\u2019t know it, but as they were producing their best work to date, this incarnation of Napalm Death was rupturing from within. Musical and business differences would splinter the band, which would see itself radically restructured in the two years that would succeed this EP release. But for the moments, Mentally Murdered was a new and different Napalm Death, one with it\u2019s ear bent to the encroaching death metal scene, and an eye towards beefing up the band\u2019s previously lo-fi recording standards. Thus this record reveals the band in an interesting middle ground, wielding the grindcore values of yore as pushed up against the very evident musical influence of Morbid Angel, a touring partner who would join the Earache roster right around the time this record was being issued. \n\n\nIt\u2019s an excellent release, completely benefiting from the sonic alchemy being toyed with. Thus songs like \u201cRise Above\u201d and the seminal \u201cWalls Of Confinement\u201d boast a maturity and even greater sense of bassy extremity that Napalm\u2019s earlier work. The songs, supported by monstrous and memorable riffs, are given nefarious life by Colin Richardson (who would go on the be one of extreme metal\u2019s finest producers) and his diabolical engineering skills. The general maturity on hand should not be surprising when one considers what the players involved would bring us in the future. \n\n\nAfter an ill-fated tour, Bill Steer would depart to concentrate completely on his gory \u201cother\u201d band Carcass, while Lee Dorrian would form/join doom/stoner rock legends Cathedral. Mick Harris would reveal other formidable sides to his musical mind with industrial/ambient projects like Scorn and Lull. Shane Embury would also be a part of many projects; the industrial tinged Malformed Earthborn being perhaps the most pleasing. I know this EP is now incorporated into a host of Napalm Death retrospectives and rarities releases, but I had to give it full points here as a stand-alone release.\n",
        "\nNapalm death have always been pretty much a constant threat to music in general, never really conforming, always pissed off. you know what your going to get with a napalm death release, which makes this album even better. \n\nOpening with Taste the poison, ND dont let up for the first half of the album, ripping through tracks like men possessed, the Angry-hatefuelled lyrics always bubbling under the surface. In my opinion the best track on here is \"cant play, wont pay\" simply because of the raw, viscereal energy they put forward, with barneys screams of revenge on the music industry being particularly effective.\n\nThere really isnt a weak point of this album. the riffs are as crushing as ever, yet in songs like blunt against the cutting edge, they have inserted a certain level of catchiness into the mix, giving it a really head banging surge. As always Danny Herrera's drumming proves him to be one of the best in the genre, if not one of the best in the world, with his single pedal blastbeats being jaw dropping and the sheer speed in which he does his fills. Shane Embury even gets a look in with his bass riffs being different from most identikit grind bands out there by the fact that he doesnt just stick to what the guitarists are doing, he has his own style and it really shows on this release.\n\nI cant fault this album at all, if you dont own it, i seriously recommend you go and get it, i refused to compare this album to any other ND albums, simply because it wouldnt be fair on the other cd's, this Album Slays. simple\n",
        "\nHere is one of the pivotal releases from British grind pioneers Napalm Death, when they began travelling a more death metal-influenced path, a more musically-able sound resulting. And did I mention it slays hard and mercilessly? Even though Mickey Harris is far from as tight as this music requires a drummer to be, I cut it slack, even though it results in the music not sounding as good as it could. \n\nFrom the pounding intro of \"Rise Above\" to the last frenzied blast beats of \"No Mental Effort\", this EP immediately grabs your head and slams it clean through the tabletop, wall, or whatever other hard surface is available with its powerful and arresting riffs and drumming. The production is cleaner and more defined, Colin Richardson starting to hit his stride in his career, but still a wall of fuzz and crashing drums is the end result. And *this* is how I prefer Lee Dorrian to sound, inhuman grunts and roars of fury as opposed to his more fey and affected vocal style in Cathedral. \n\nThe lyrics are brilliant, intelligently-written condemnations of modern society even though you definitely need the lyric sheet to even try to understand what the hell Lee is saying here. Mickey is still screaming mindlessly in the background with his usual \"caveman with his balls in a vise\" style, and it only adds to the chaotic madness on display here. Brillo pad fuzz bass sound and chainsaw guitars are the final piece in this wonderfully wild, mad portrait of ND at a crossroads in their career. \n\nThis was also the last recording with the classic lineup, before Lee and Bill jumped ship and were replaced by Barney Greenway and the twin-guitar tandem of Jesse Pintado and Mitch Harris, and a total death metal sound resulted. Not that \"Harmony Corruption\" is a bad album, but this is the last of ND as pure grind we had for years before they got their act back on track and started slaying again. Hunt this fucker down and terrify the neighbors with it!\n",
        "\nNapalm Death has come a long way... they've played on grounds that only punk rockers would walk and eventually left the punk rock sound to come across grindcore, what the band is known for pioneering... and now onto death metal. It's apparent that Napalm Death finally reached a metal level... many people may argue that Napalm Death has been metal to begin with, but grindcore isn't necessarily metal. More than likely, as I like to describe grindcore, I see it as \"schizophrenic hardcore punk.\" Death metal, on the other hand... well do I really need to explain that one?\n\nWhat makes this death metal? Well, for one, the growls are in the vein of death vocals as opposed to the shriek/grunt style presented on the last few albums. Also, everything from the production to instrument sounds have a death metal quality... it's really tuned low; they must've loosened the strings on the guitar and bass to get a really low rough sound... a super rough sound on this split at least. One question remains... is that necessarily good or bad on Napalm Death's behalf?\n\nFor now at least, this isn't a bad transition. While this new sound they're playing is death metal, Napalm Death still maintains a grindcore characteristic on this split. Most of these songs here are just re-recordings of some of their grindcore stuff. \"Multinational Corporations Pt. 2\" is the only song which dramatically sounds different. This was the introduction to the \"Scum\" album, which only featured grunted screams and cymbal playing on the original song. This, on the other hand, is a super death/doom sounding song with the slowest possible beat Mitch Harris ever played in his life. The growls display Lee Dorrian's new style of singing, and it sounds very morbid on this song. Everything else is pretty much just a mere \"blast\" with low growls and distortion. It seems like this time around, those \"blast\" songs have no effort put into them. \n\nThe only big bad thing about Napalm Death's stuff here is that it doesn't possess the raw energy releases like \"From Enslavement To Obliteration\" had... it seems like Napalm Death out some effort into sounding death metal... but there's still some energy in this release, just not a real punk attitude kind of energy. Everything, excluding the first track, is nothing more than muffled noise in my mind. Either the production is terrible or just the music itself is terrible, I don't know, but this music doesn't seem to do it for me. They tried too hard this time around. I like their \"anit-music\" approach on their recording though... they've stilled kept that on this release, making every song as minimal and schizophrenic as possible.\n\nOverall, this is a nice transition into new territory and then again a bad idea...\n\n...\n\n\nEar catchers: Every track is worth the listen (being most of the tracks are no longer than a minute) but the first track (\"Multinational Corporations Pt. 2\") is the most unique song on this split for Napalm Death.\n",
        "\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say thanks to everyone out there for coming down and supporting the welfare of animals\u201d explains vocalist Mark Greenway as this massive live album begins. A death metal/grindcore band playing an 80 minute set for the welfare of animals.\n\nRecorded live at the University of London on April 12, 2002, the legendary Napalm Death rip through tracks spanning their entire career as well as a couple of covers - the Dead Kennedys, Death and Raw Power - which has been in the setlist for some time. A particular highlight is \"Back from the Dead\" in this regard: given a raw production the original by Death never had.\n\nThe production really brings out the ferocity of this album and shows how tight the band really is. They cruise through some songs, twisting the screws on others but its overall pretty even. Dan Hererra on drums is a mayhemic standout, the riffs are just as any Napalm Death studio album sounds, but rawer. The setlist is finely chosen, even though it does concentrate on newer material. However, like any 80 minute album, it's a test of stamina and lacks the visual presentation the DVD medium provides enhancing this same show for a much more impressive package.\n\nThere is really no reason to own this over the DVD, but for what it is \"Punishment in Capitals\" is crushing Napalm Death - you should know what to expect.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death isn't really my favourite, at least the latest recordings, which seem to me just almost aggressive, with the very negative meaning of the first 'a word'. However, those old grindcore stuff still makes me impressed and one album makes me really stunned... \n\n\"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\" is much more than just an album. For the first and the last time Napalm Death really fills music with what they want to say - with that whole aggression against all stupid on this world. It may be heard in every single moment of the album. \n\nOn the musical ground the band mixed its traditional grindcore elements with experimental death metal. Actually, it's the only ND release that is so aggressive and so experimental. Strange, heavy riffs that melt into chaos, interrupted by catchy \"melodies\" or riffs. All distorted by great growls (Greenway's best performance) and chaotised drums... The whole makes some kind of chaos with catchy moments. Sounds nice. \n\nSongs are very good, with few outstanding exceptions like \"Hung\", \"More than meets the eye\". \"State of mind\" or \"Armageddon times seven\". There are no bad moments here, though the ending may seem a bit less aggressive. All in all, \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\" stays the best what the Englishmen have ever done and what they probably will. A pity they have never used any of its great elements anymore.\n",
        "\nTo cut straight to the point, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with this album.\n\nFirst and foremost it's not even remotely a patch on the previous two studio albums, nor is it really what I'd come to expect from Napalm Death - although in hindsight what with the Leaders Not Followers sequel coming out prior to this, it does seem to make sense as to the new styling.\n\nMake no mistake, this is noticeably far more punky than in my opinion Napalm Death have been for at least the last decade, harking back more their slightly mediocre mid-90's output much derided.\n\nQuite what is going on with the production on this job either I don't know, as the songs themselves, when taken out of the context of being NAPALM DEATH songs, aren't actually that bad songs with a rather vicious streak. It's just that said viscious streak is ultimately let down by, again the punk influence, the really stripped down poor production sound. Kind of like if you envisage a nasty-ass rabid pit-bull.... only one which has had it's teeth all pulled out.\nSure it can still bite you and lock it's jaws on, but it's not gonna do half as much damage to your legs as it could have done.\n\n\nI'm pretty much certain that there'll no doubt be a certain clique of people that will buy this album solely for the fact that it has a guest appearance not just from Metal Hammer flavour of the month (Hatebreed member) Jamey Jasta (in what in my opinion is a rather strange inclusion) but also from sheer utter legend of extreme metal himself, Jeff Walker (carcass), making his first appearance on a high-profile recording for quite some time now.\n\nAs much as I probably absolutely hate to rip into Napalm Death, especially as they were practically the first death metal band I got into & loved, this album really fails to interest me at all really as anything other than filler music. It kind of brings up comparisons between this and say 'Inside The Torn Apart' or the godawful 'Diatribes' album... only this one slightly fails to look remotely convincing standing up against those two.\n\n\nIf you listen to 'Enemy Of The Music Business', you'll no doubt hear the punky groove that's become almost a signature sound of Napalm's, only done with more subtletly or with more effectiveness. 'The Code Is Red... blah' just sounds too much like a death metal band trying to convince the world they were a punk band all along.\n\nOn it's own it's probably not a BAD album, certainly not a great one by a long shot, but put into context that it's Napalm Death, one of the most intense ferocious British bands that have existed...\n\nAfter the expectation of something alltogether awe-inspiring created by the high-end nature of not just the ferocity but the quality when the band went from the superb 'Enemy Of The Music Business' to the slightly samey yet still darn good 'Order Of The Leech'... after all that, I'm afraid 'The Code Is Red...' quite simply doesn't live up to it.\n\n\nMaybe it's just about time that Barney fucked off and made a punk band himself, rather than trying to unsubtlely forcing one of the most influential DM bands into becoming a rather mediocre 80's-punk-tribute bands.\n",
        "\nNow, you won't find a lot of death metal or grindcore in my music collection, but I do know its history. And while Napalm Death didn't invent the genre, (as someone here on Metal Archieves pointed out) they're the band responsible for making it the (somewhat) well-known genre it is today. And while they did stray from their traditional sound in 90's, they are back making the music that made them (somewhat) famous.\n\nWhat's really cool about this album is that it came out on Century Media, so it was available in the major chain stores that stocked metal music. It also came with a free CD that featured tracks from CM's death metal and metalcore bands. The compilation is kinda meh, but hey, free CD!\n\nAnyways, getting into the music... What can I say? This is what death/grind is supposed to sound like! The blast beats, (a Napalm Death invention, BTW), the fast, distorted guitars, Barney Greenway's harsh growled vocals... The Code is Red, Long Live the Code is sure to appeal to all fans of the genre.\n\nNow, there aren't any rediculously short songs on this record, which is good, cuz really short songs kinda turn me off when it comes to grindcore. Only the second track, Right You Are, is less than a minute long, and, following on the heel of the explosive opener Silence Is Deafening, it's well-placed. Additionally, there are only three other songs, of the 15 on the album, that don't make it to the 2:45 mark, and one of them is the instrumental closer.\n\nAnother thing that's cool about this album are the backing vocals, which accentuate the chorus on Silence is Deafening and really add to the epic four minute long(!) tracks on the album, The Great And The Good and All Hail The Grey Dawn. While they are longer than most grindcore, they maintain a fast pace throughout, and the four minutes goes by faster than expected.\n\nIn fact, all of the songs on this record are played with blistering speed, until you get to the end. Morale, the fourteenth of fifteen tracks, (clocking in at a total time of just over 45 minutes) is more of a mid-paced song, with Barney trying to sound like a death metal singer and long instrumental breaks. And are those keyboards coming in near the end? Well, whatever instrument they are, they continue on throughout the final track, an instrumental entitled Our Pain is Their Power.\n\nNow, while it's not terrible, Morale does stand out as being weaker than the rest. However, it also seems that Century Media has pegged it as the single off this record, seeing how the music video for it is also included. If you end up seeing it on MTV, (don't ask me why you'd be watching MTV in the first place) and thinking that's what the new Napalm Death album sounds like, don't be fooled. Morale notwithstanding, this is an outstanding release.\n",
        "\nNote: This is a review of the original 15-track album.\n\nA promising start to Napalm Death\u2019s fourth studio outing, as first proper song \u201cI Abstain\u201d creates a comfortable parallel between their grindcore roots and more recent death metal flourish. They have an operable sound, (at initial impressions) sound songwriting skills, Barney Greenway\u2019s distinctive roars and an individual character that could surely make this one hell of an album. The album that this might have unfolded into is quickly thrown out of the window as a spreading lack of variety loosens the album\u2019s tight grip. They concentrate on trying to be as relentless and favourably inaccessible as they could and create instead a monotonous flop, where they have three songs\u2019 worth of material mixed and matched into thirteen (not including the take-it-or-leave-it style intro and closing track).\n\nIt\u2019s a common problem, repeated much by Cannibal Corpse and co. and thankfully avoided by many others. Sound-alike songs for a whole album really dampen the appeal when they invariably have no standout qualities from the next. Bolt Thrower could pull it off alright by maintaining the energy and grinding out the hooks, but Napalm Death here didn\u2019t. It ends up becoming a decidedly faceless album, which is a shame given their reputation. When they try to be different right at the end, they just fuck it up. Poor Napalm Death\u2026 \n\nThe meat grinding \u201dDementia Access\u201d along with \u201cThe World Keeps Turning\u201d, \u201cAryanisms\u201d and \u201cDistorting the Medium\u201d are the other ones that do sound pretty good off the shelf, but only there. All I recall when I think about the album is that it generally has itself a strong sound, but no individual songs come to mind otherwise. The rest is just tedious full stop. The longest track on hand here is to finish. \u201cContemptuous\u201d, I hoped would come full circle with electrifying velocity and fresh bludgeoning riffs to make a dramatic and forceful close. What it is instead is akin to Slipknot\u2019s \u201cIowa\u201d reduced to a merciful 4 minutes, but still being a seemingly endless hulking mass. Sure it breaks away from the stony template of all the other stuff, but annoyingly doesn\u2019t move onto anywhere just as it seems like it might be about to get going. It starts with a cool fitting sound clip from \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d but the heavy, clanging ambience never really develops.\n\nWhile this album is hardly total cack, it could have definitely been a lot more given the more than capable abilities of the five musicians here who pour it all in for a few brief moments of glory.\n",
        "\nOh good god, this is sheer grind, brutal, fast, incisive. Everything that any Napalm fan could ever want, this is so good I'd call it a 'blasterpiece' it is that godly.\n\nWhat makes it so amazing is how it is a proper throwback to what many call the glory days. None of the death metal experimentation here, this has the feel of an album that comes between 'From enslavement to obliteration' and 'Harmony corruption'. It is brutal, short and boy does it tear your face off.\n\nHighlights for me are 'Right you are' Purely because of Barney's seething vocals, he sounds like he is about to pick up an automatic and simply go postal on this track. 'Diplomatic immunity' is pure vintage ND singing about politicians, their lies and how hide away from any form of consequence. \n\nThis album completes the comeback. After the stunning (personally my favourite) album 'Enemy of the music business' the band wavered a little on the follow up 'Order of the leech' While Leech was a sonic barrage, it had very little of the ND vibe. But this... By god it is awesome, if you loved the late 80's/early 90's Napalm Death then get out there and buy this record, it is truly awesome, simple as that!\n",
        "\nMuch has been written and said about the Napalm dudes. \u2018Scum\u2019, described as a collection of cacophonous conmotion, introduced the planet Earth to a new breed of animal in 1987. Things were somewhat different in the following years after line-up shifts. In fact, \u2018Death by Manipulation\u2019 stands for a pivotal point where the testimony of two eras are recorded. \n\nThis release is rather a compilation of songs featuring two different incarnations of the mighty Napalm Death. The songs found here show that in spite of any facelifts or moves into the death metal territory, the band hadn\u2019t lost their rabid bent for the blast burst.\n\nTracks 1-4 are solid and even wiser than the rest of this collection. The riffs are more focused and production is almost flawless. In fact, the re-done versions of \u2018Unchallenged Hate\u2019 and \u2018Social Sterility\u2019 are far away form the original found in \u2018From Enslavement to Obliteration\u2019 (1988).\n\nTracks 5-7, from \u2018Suffer the Children\u2019 (1990), are interesting but unnecessary. The re-worked version of \u2018Siege of Power\u2019 (originally found in \u2018Scum\u2019) is the only worthy track because of the new arrangements and better riffs.\n\nTracks 8-13, from \u2018Mentally Murdered\u2019 (1989), made up the legacy of the Dorrian-Steer affinity. These are a raw, anti-music mindset. The blast is ever present and the lead work is corrosive. Dorrian spews out lyrics as if he was possessed while the band spearheaded higher levels of aural evisceration.\n\nThe rest are bonus tracks that add little to this collection of tracks spanning the period of transition in the process of Napalm Death\u2019s evolution.\n\nEven though there are many bands with the obsessive bent for the blast that it\u2019s just the norm today, Napalm Death is an entity that shape-shifted without losing its stamina and \u2018Death by Manipulation\u2019 is the record to prove it.\n",
        "\n(A reviewer's goal principally must be objective explanation of what an musical release is - both the form and content - and to avoid any subjectivism and thus the non-objective praise or criticism. This review is subjective, and it expresses mine own interpretation of this demo, so I appologise for some possible 'strange' inventions posted below...)\n\n\nThis is the strangest release of Napalm Death. Harsh punk gets mixed with some depressive chords and a sound, which reminds me of the Thorns' demos. Imagine Discharge with some Burzum-like moments ('What Man Can Do'), noisy michrophonies and the angriest ever heard cries - that's what 'Hatred Surge' is all about. The oppening riff of my favourite track - 'So Sad' - reminds me of Master's Hammer's (!) 'Vykoupeni', and then appear those more-blackmetallish guitar parts, and the voice of a human being who is completely lost any hope, entrapped in the social 'prison without walls' of oppression and mass ignorance - the dignity and smashed human nature react through these simple riffs and desperate shouts, cursing the rotten world around us. \n\nThere are tracks like 'Instinct Of Survival', 'Control', 'Caught... In A Dream', which will be later reworked and heard in the famous 'Scum' release (the birth of grind core). Here in this demo they still sound very punkish (Crass were one of the most influential bands for the early Civil Defence/Napalm Death). 'Cheswick Green' is another punk crusher, recorded live and of course, with a very poor quality. The rest of the tracks are more listenable as a sound, but for those who respect some band, the sound/record quality is the last thing to care of. \n\nHatred radiates from this demo, both lyrically and musically, so if you want to hear one of the most outright and honest hardcore protest against the modern 'brave new world', find and listen to 'Hatred Surge'. No matter what kind of metal you like at all - true rebellious music is always the righteous fist in the face of lowdirt. Napalm Death have recorded that on a tape.\n",
        "\nWhile I like Napalm Death, I certainly don't love them. It is one of those bands whose albums you first buy because everyone tells you that they are old school, that they started this and that, and that most metalheads seem to have an appreciation for. My appreciation is lukewarm, though, and so far this is the best thing I've heard from them.\n\nJust to inform those who haven't heard it, this is Napalm Death more at the death metal end of their career than the grind period, but grindy influences can still be detected. The guitars are not as downtuned as traditional death metal, and the vocals are more of Barney's trademark shout/growl than your average throat-ripping Corpsey performance. The drumming is one of the most enduringly lovable things about Napalm Death though, as it is steady throughout.\n\nI wish I could say the same about the album. 'The Infiltrator' is a damn awesome song, good lyrics, good chorus, one hell of a breakdown. \"Next of Kin to Chaos\" is cool as well, a slow, chugging tune that makes you wish they took it slow all the time. \"Inciendary Incoming\" is not too bad, and \"Thrown Down A Rope\" is amazing as well, with a riff that sounds like the tension wires on a bridge snapping and the whole damn thing falling down. It is the songs in between these that seem repetitive, lackluster, unmemorable and unexciting.\n\nThe live tracks at the end are recorded pretty well, but also not exciting. I guess buy it for The Infiltrator and Thrown Down a Rope alone. I really try to like these guys - I saw them recently and they were funny, honest, and talked to the fans after the show. But their material really needs to be condensed into a greatest hits that has more focus than the one they came out with.\n",
        "\nWhen a good band releases a cover-album, it tends to suck, no matter how good the band is or the songs are. There are only a few cover-albums, which doesn't suck. This one doesn't suck, on the contrary, it's the best cover-album I've heard for a long time.\n\nNapalm Death isn't my favorite, but many of my friends called me a loony when I listened to Enemy of the Music Business-album. Then I suddenly had this one on my hands, I placed it to my record player and the next reaction was something between happiness and getting totally fucked up.\n\nBut what the hell does this release contain? All the songs are either hardcore, death metal or thrash metal. Only a few of them are well-known: Kreator, Sepultura, Agnostic Front, Hellhammer and Discharge. The rest of the bands are less-known, bands who never got out of their cellars. Many of these bands released an album or two, some demos, before disappearing. And that's a shame.\n\nNapalm Death adds their brutality to the mix, though the songs could be recognized (if you know the songs, of course). The vocalist Barney Greenway still sounds like an angry goat. The guitarist Mitch Harris screams like he is being tortured with the fork, sending me to change my pants. This album introduced to me many good (and forgotten) bands like Cryptic Slaughter, Wehrmacht and Master, just to name a few. This album belongs to my albums-of-the-year-list.\nVery angry package, indeed.\n",
        "\nYou want pretty melodies? You want keyboards providing texture and ambience? You want dynamics and musical prowess? HAH!!! Look elsewhere, people, cos this whole entire album will tear your empty head off and toss it into orbit! \n\nPut it this way; I used to listen to this cassette on mornings I had to get up at the asscrack of dawn to go to work at a job I hated, and it woke my sleepy ass up faster than caffeine ever did. Within the first few blasts of noise, I mean songs, yet. And I mean blasts of noise in the best possible way, as this is grind at its purest and most undiluted. The late, great John Peel somehow managed to capture the rawest of the raw in aural form, as this album sounds like it was recorded in a garage, with trashy drums, ultra-grungy downtuned guitar and obscenely fuzzed-out bass, and Lee Dorrian's vokills right in your ear like he's screaming and roaring right next to you. And it is a brilliant representation of what Napalm were about \"back in the day\".\n\nFrom blasts of sound only a few seconds long to (slightly) more coherent attempts at songs, alll the great classic ND stuff is here on display; \"The Kill\", \"Lucid Fariytale\", \"Instinct of Survival\" (featuring Mickey's most deranged whirlwind screams ever), their choice cover of Siege's \"Walls\", \"Deceiver\" (which blatantly rips off the intro riff of Repulsion's \"The Stench of Burning Flesh\") , it is all here, all good, and all GRIND. Lee sounds like he's demonically possessed here on every tune (he has never done it for me in Cathedral, I have to say, after hearing all this especially), and Mickey's trademark bloodcurdling \"whirlwind screams\" will make you cringe in terror. \n\nMany (if not most) of these songs sound alike, but at this insanely, impossibly high level of energy and intensity who cares? And this album WILL get your blood rushing, your heart pounding, and you ecstatically screaming your head off every second of the roughest ride you will *ever* experience. Who cares if you can't understand a word they're saying, this is the best representation of ND you will get at their noisiest and most sense-obliterating and cardiac-arrest-inducing before they toned it down a little in favor of a more metal-influenced direction musically. Get this and know what true devastation is.\n",
        "\n\"Scum\",the first ever grindcore album, is a must have for any fan of grindcore,death metal, hardcore or even punk.\nThe line up is really archaic, one of the early line ups,(yes there were other members before the band recorded \"scum\"!)\nThe production is raw, giving the cd a gritty feel. Elements of punk and hardcore clubbed together to create a sound so raw and brutal, it could change the way you look at the world around you.\nThe songs mainly deal with socio-political issues such as governments,multi-national corporations, 3rd world nations etc. The album got napalm death noticed because of its ferocious anti-commercial stance. Each song is a furious minute long burst of agonizing guitars and vocals coupled with blast beats and fast punk style drumming.Songs on this cd may come across as short detonations of noise to the untrained ear.\n\nThe guitars on the first 13 tracks sounds more punkish. The guitar on the songs after track 13 are more buzzsaw like and \"grindcore\" sounding, this kind of tuning is what you may hear on most other grindcore bands.\n\nVocals range anywhere from gruffy shouts to savage screams (\"whirlwind screams\" as the cd inlay describes it).\n\n\nSome of the songs are very mosh-able but most are just furious explosions of sonic violence making it very different from later napalm death albums where songs would be around 4 minutes in length and sound more refined and polished.\nIts really hard to keep track of the songs without looking at the display on your cd player.Most may not even differentiate between the tracks which all are the same blasts of noise only varying in terms of riffs and drum paterns.\nI guess that makes listening to it better. You have to play the entire album from start to finish and just sit back and take the pounding and enjoy all 26 tracks as one unit all together.\n\nScum would sound very harsh on your ears and devastate your idea of extreme music if your listening to it for the first time but then again, this is how napalm death stormed through the metal world, crushing death metal and thrash metal bands alike.\n\n4 songs youll have to pay attention to are:\nMultinational corporations : Composed of guitar noise, with cymbals crashing faintly and a pissed off voice going \"multinational corporations, genocide of the starving nations\". This is the greatest opening track on any cd.\n\nInstinct of surival : A bizarre mutation of punk metal, has a great vocal pattern. And great opening riff.\n\nMoral crusade : This is on the \"second\" half of the cd. Boils with angry screams and growls and insane guitarwork.\nThe most extreme outburst of guitars, drums and vocals ever recorded. \n\nYou suffer : Ok, this isnt exactly a song, but just a songlet less than 1 second!!! This holds the world record for shortest song ever released. Probably inspired the trend of releasing really short songs among other grindcore songs.\n\nOn an ending note, it should be observed that no ther band -save for Black Sabbath,has achieved what Napalm death have - Inspire a whole new genre of music with just their debut called Grindcore. (which would later spawn several subgenres - noise, crust, goregrind, porngrind, shitcore etc that would eventually flood the category)\n\nNapalm death rises tall above all the bullshit . They are LIVING LEGENDS, probably the last worthy survivor in this genre. The fact that they exist to this day without leaving behind any of the brutality is a standing testament to this fact.Little wonder the name \"napalm death\" is synonymous with the term \"grindcore\".\nAnother interesting point is that two other big bands branched out of the line up on this album: Bill steer(bass) would quit to form carcass, and Lee dorian (vocals) would start cathedral. Both bands gained their own brand of popularity in the metal underground.\nA sacred relic to every grindcore fan and a powerhouse of socio-political expression, \"scum' is a must buy for any fan of extreme music. Truly, this album is a piece of modern music history.\n",
        "\nReleased by Earache after the label and band kissed and made up after the latter left the former under a cloud, this double CD \u2018best of\u2019 charts Napalm Death\u2019s time with Earache from 1986 to 1998. Disc 1 is basically \u201cNapalm Death \u2013 the Earache years\u201d, so don\u2019t go expecting post-Earache goodies from the Leaders not Followers albums, \u201cEnemy of the Music Business\u201d and \u201cOrder of the Leech\u201d while Disc 2 has goodies like the entire \u201cMentally Murdered\u201d EP, bonus songs, some covers pre-Leaders not Followers, original mixes and more.\n\nDisc 1 contains what Napalm Death and Earache have chosen as the best songs from Napalm\u2019s time at the label, from time honoured favourites like \u201cScum\u201d, \u201cFrom Enslavement to Obliteration\u201d and \u201cMass Appeal Madness\u201d to the more experimental period (experimental by Napalm Death\u2019s standards) like \u201cGreed Killing\u201d \u201cArmageddon x 7\u201d and \u201cDiatribes\u201d.\n\nAnything from \u201cScum\u201d and FETO (the album, not the bands own label for those watching in black and white) are guaranteed to kick your arse from the get go and grind themselves into your mind. Whenever you like to or not are academic. Otherwise, it\u2019s rather a case of hit or miss, depending on your view, which in my case is well, hit and miss. Barney Greenway\u2019s early vocals performances for the Grindcore greats are steady growlers though he later comes into his own near the end of Napalm Death\u2019s time with Earache. It\u2019s probably because his early performances suffered from being under Lee Dorrian\u2019s shadow or the fans expectations being on him.\n\nAs for the post FETO songs on the disc, some songs work and some don\u2019t, the good songs of the group are \u201cContemptuous\u201d (an good example of the band\u2019s ability to perform slower songs), Barney\u2019s version of \u201cSocial Sterility\u201d (an improvement over the FETO version), \u201cLowpoint\u201d (reminds me of the Scum album), \u201cHung\u201d (Heavy cruncher of riffage and blastbeats), \u201cNext of Kin to Chaos\u201d (One of Barney\u2019s greatest vocal performances) and \u201cNazi Punks Fuck Off\u201d (good cover of the Dead Kennedy\u2019s song). Weaker songs of the group such as the \u201cDeath by Manipulation\u201d versions of \u201cUnchallenged Hate\u201d and \u201cSiege of Power\u201d (both are a good reason not the re-record songs by your former vocalist, 9 times out of 10, it just isn\u2019t the same), \u201cThe Infiltraitor\u201d (bland) and \u201cDiatribes\u201d (too much focus of effects and not enough on riffs and drumming, also bland).\n\nOne maybe hard done by the fact that there aren\u2019t more songs from both the Scum and FETO albums but the band has done more then those two greats that propelled the band into living legends. Another minus for disc 1 is that some albums are neglected than others (Harmony Corruption for example).\n\nDisc 2 is where we have some rarities from Napalm Death\u2019s past for those into Napalm Death before and since \u201cScum\u201d and for those who been into Napalm Death the 1990\u2019s and beyond who want a taste of Napalm Death\u2019s past, in fact, this disc goes into the band\u2019s pre-Earache past with \u201cThe Traitor\u201d and \u201cAbattoir\u201d. Some rare material heard for the first time (\u201cScum\u201d with Lee Dorrian on vocals) amongst others. Again, the quality varies, the Mentally Murdered EP featured what can said to be the best material by the line up that gave the world FETO (Lee, Bill, Shane and Mick), the solo on \u201cWalls of Confinement\u201d is probably the best solo Bill had ever done in his career. Mick never sounded any better here as well and Lee was at his most guttural for the recordings, the riffage on display is nice and crunchy and above all, arse kicking.\n\nBeyond that, we go back into hit-and-miss country here, though there\u2019s more \u201chits\u201d than \u201cmisses\u201d with an extra of oddness thrown for good measure. In the hits section, we have \u201cPride Assassin\u201d (good cross between FETO production and Harmony Corruption), \u201cMalignant Trait\u201d (Pure blasting to great effect and riffs that eat you alive), \u201cInsanity Excursion\u201dand \u201cPolitics of Common Sense\u201d While in the misses section, dishonourable mentions go to \u201cTwist the Knife Slowly original mix\u201d (bland and not heavy by ND standards).In the odd-as-hell section, and honourable mentions go to the live covers of Godflesh\u2019s \u201cAvalanche Master Song\u201d (the hell?) and \u201cDeceiver\u201d which had a different intro to the song on the \u201cScum\u201d album (the intro was by a band called The Swankys, which was a serious case of what the fuck?) and the Swans inspired \u201cInternal Animosity\u201d (the FETO line up doing an atmospheric song? Blimey!).\n\nWith the two pre-Scum songs, \u201cThe Traitor\u201d and \u201cAbattoir\u201d reflection the band\u2019s early days as a Punk band going into a metamorphosis into the beast that resulted in \u201cScum\u201d. The production values vary from song to song on both discs as does the guitar tuning, from good to raw and sometimes slightly iffy. One has to remember this is Napalm Death, the very early years to Napalm Death, the Experimental years via the Spotlight years etc.\n\nDespite some weak songs selected and the rare appearances of Nik Bullen and Lee Dorrian on disc 1. This is a collector\u2019s item for old and new fans alike, worth purchasing.\n\nEDIT: Swans never did \"Internal Animosity\", Napalm Death were inspired by them for the song.\n",
        "\nThis is the first review I've written on this site, and I wanted to save it for this release. Having first heard Napalm Death a few years ago (and now owning the majority of their discography and claiming them as my favourite band), I soon heard acclaim for their 'Leaders not Followers' ep. Upon further inspection I realised this was a six track ep, on which napalm cover some of their biggest influences in the hardcore, grindcore, punk and death genres, giving each song the odd trademark napalm blast. The only quarrel I had with this ep was its length, clocking in at just under 20 minutes, i was left gasping for more of my personal highlights of 'Nazi Punks Fuck off' (Dead Kennedys) and 'Back From the Dead' (Death). Not long ago I heard news of the release of this album, the follow-up, and a full-length. I bought it on its day of release (the day I am writing this review) and will try my best to give you the low-down.\n\nThe album begins with a cover of Cryptic Slaughter's 'Lowlife', a crowd favourite at CS gigs. This song begins with a crazy drum intro, where guitars and bass soon follow suit, with some dizzy riffing spiralling into the verse, where we Barney's trademark gruff growling, suprisingly followed by some awesome second vocals by Mitch (whom, although I've heard do vocals before, never sounding this intense and .... somewhat hardcore, in a strange kind of way). This song is definitely one of the highlights on the album, and the cd even includes a live video of the band playing this song, stick it in your computer and druel. 'Face Down in the Dirt' (The Offenders) is instantly recognisable as old skool hardcore and has a very hostile sound to it. It is a real short sharp shock (though in no way on the same scale as 'you suffer' or 'dead'!). 'Devastation' (Devastation) is a full-on death metal attack, and I love every second of it, taken from a band whom Barney claims are vocally one of his biggest influences, it almost sounds like Napalm could have penned this song themselves (apart from the slow intro). 'Messiah' (Hellhammer) begins with an improvised 'Morbid Tales' intro riff, and then propels into the cover itself, the song is extremely powerful in the capable hands of Napalm Death, and, although being very little like their usual sound, it is played and \u2018sung\u2019 very well. There are two Anti Cimex covers on this album, and this first one is very Discharge-esque and would be an awesome sight seen live ( I imagine). Being honest, I\u2019d never heard of Wehrmacht before I got this cd, but upon hearing the cover of this song, I have begun searching for their LPs. Hearing the opening guitar work on this cover of \u2018Night of Pain\u2019, I instantly noted the metalling-up of the Halloween movie soundtrack, which sounds fucking awesome here, I\u2019m yet to hear the original of this song, but this cover is nothing short of amazing, in my opinion, and only goes to highlight the musical ability and competence of Napalm Death, I hate to say it but the vocals (although great as ever) are undermined by the awesome music of this song. Next up is the song I was most looking forward to hearing: \u2018War\u2019s no fairytale\u2019 (Discharge) and the Napalm boys don\u2019t disappoint, this is quality stuff, simple as that, and makes you want to listen to discharge more than ever. Many may remember Napalm\u2019s cover of Siege\u2019s \u2018Walls\u2019 on the BBC sessions, here they cover \u2018Conform\u2019, again an excellent cover, but with better production, however, without meaning to knock this song, I personally prefer the \u2018Walls\u2019 cover on the BBC sessions. \u2018Master\u2019 (Master) is a great tune, bursting with sheer brutality. It\u2019s brilliantly played and ends superbly with \u201cYOU FUCKING WIMP!\u201d. The intro to the next song that follows, Insanity\u2019s \u2018Fire Death Fate\u2019 is gripping and immediately grabs your attention if, in the unlikely event, it was wandering. It is great death metal with an almost hardcore catchy chorus, with backing vocals emphasising the hardcore sound. Kreator\u2019s \u2018Riot of Violence\u2019 is easily one of the best moments on the album, I can\u2019t decide whether or not I prefer it to the original, I think I do (controversy ensues). The next Anti Cimex cover, \u2018Game of the Arseholes\u2019 is a dig at organised religion, hence \u201cTake your fucking cross and stick it up your arse!\u201d, this is the better of the two Anti Cimex covers, it has a more punk, aggressive feel to it and sounds great from start to finish. \u2018Clangor of War\u2019 (Massacre) boasts a super brutal intro and keeps up the pace in this death metal gem of a song, with an excellent mosh-inducing riff about halfway through. I\u2019d never heard Attitude Adjustment before, but I definitely will after hearing this song, \u2018Dope Fiend\u2019 is brutal, and the sort of song you can\u2019t just sit and listen to, it makes you want to mosh real hard. Die Kruezen\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m Tired\u2019 is a short sharp shock of hardcore violence and is a great moment on the record. Ah, the Sepultura cover\u2026 this is fucking amazing! From the intro that builds up until Barney has a go at a Brazilian accented \u201cun, dos, tres, cuatro\u201d and the song kicks in and you can do nothing but headbang helplessly. This is definitely one of my favourite moments on the album. \u2018Bedtime story\u2019 (The Dayglo Abortions) is hardcore with excellent riffs and speedy verses. \u2018Blind Justice\u2019 (Agnostic Front) begins like pure hardcore punk should do, a rumbling bass intro with blasting guitars and drums, this is just over a minute long, but is brilliant from start to finish. The final song \u2018Hate, Fear and Power\u2019 (Hirax) is 30 seconds long and is a brilliant abrupt ending to what has been a brilliant album, in my opinion.\nThe album is the band\u2019s first release on Century Media and the packaging with artwork and general presentation of the CD is the best yet of any Napalm Death release I\u2019ve seen. Now I cant wait for the next Napalm Death album (of originals)!\n",
        "\nNot a fan of this style, however, I was impressed on how few people came to post here about this album. I use to play on a funny little project of Grindcore, more as a joke project than anything serious ,just because even if sucking as music per se, grindcore is REALLY funny to play as joke. and I listened to this album several times to get an idea of the style. What I can say is that, this CD, along with Carcass \"Reek of Putrefaction\" and Napalm Death predecessor \"Scum\" where among the most extreme albums of the entire 80\u00b4s decade. This could be probably considered the \"earliest\" ND \"death metal\" record, as Scum sounds more like a ultrafast hardcorethrash mix and is quite enjoyable. FETO is much faster, darker and heavier than Scum, plus the vocals are much more growled and guttural, to the point of being not of my liking, however, I believe that , to any extreme metal fan this is a must have , because it probably set many standards to 90\u00b4s Death Metal in general, the riffs, altought buried on the blastbeats , are quite good for this style and the vocals, altought horrible to my ears, fit the style perfectly and I believe, are capable of pleasing the ears of any extreme metal fan of Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation and bands alike.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death aren't a band they are already a living legend and finally \"Noise For Music's Sake\" is the definitive Napalm Death collection. \nThese are (arguably) the inventors of grindcore, and they have confused the extreme music scene for more than 20 years! \n\nThe first CD features all of Napalm Death's classics like songs from their early records \"Scum\" and \"Suffer The Children\" and of course they also cover the best songs off the later albums \"Diatribes\" and \"Breed To Breathe\". \n\nAs I said this CD features only some tracks off the albums so it's definitely not a complete discography. It would be just to much to name all the tracks but beside the classics like \"Scum\", \"You Suffer\" or \"Deceiver\" off the Scum-LP, \"Hung\" from \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\" and \"Antibody\" from the \"Greed Killing\" album they also offer \"The Chains That Bind Us\" from \"Harmony Corruption\" or \"Breed to Breathe\" from \"Inside The Torn Apart\"! \n\nThey picked the best songs of all their albums and at the end of the first CD they also added the Dead Kennedys cover \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off\"! \n\nThe second CD features rare and unreleased tracks beginning with the four songs off the \"Mentally Murdered\" EP and \"Pride Assassin\" off \"Mass Appeal Madness\", the live cover of Godflesh's \"Avalanche Master Song\". After that two songs off the \"World Keeps Turning\" EP and the bonus tracks off \"Fear, Emptiness, Despair\" made it on this compilation. \n\nNow we come to the demo-version of \"Upwards and Uninterested\" that was also on the Split with Coalesce and the demo-version of \"I Abstain\". Next ones are \"Politics of Common Sense\" off the At The Gates Split and four compilation tracks. \n\nLast but not least, we get five unreleased tracks, the Pete Coleman mix of \"Remain Nameless\" & \"Twist the Knife\". \"Deceiver\" live in Wacken '87 with Mitch Dickinson of Unseen Terror on guitar, \"The Traitor\" live in Birmingham '86 and \"Abattoir\" also live in Birmingham '86! \n\nThat's it...almost 2 1/2 hours of Napalm Death destruction and this should be a part of every single \"TRUE\" metal CD-collection.\n",
        "\nWell what do we have here?\n\nOnly probably THE singlehandedly most extreme reknowned and pioneering albums of the eighties which has influenced countless extreme bands since... all with a debut album.\n\n'Scum' is effectively comprised of two demos which got the band signed with the two different lineup each forming one half of the album. The first, and superior, half contains both the blistering title track that is still a death classic even now, as well as the infamous two-second hyperblast (one of many) that is 'You Suffer'; the latter half with the more familar Embury, Dorrian, Harris lineup.\n\nThis music is raw (yet not underproduced to detriment), incendiary, brutal... practically sheer aural carnage. Music to destroy things to. Or more to the point, music to bring down governments /multi-nationals with.\n\nScum practically invented what would later be termed 'grindcore' even though the band would later evolve into more of a death-grind hybrid with hardcore & punk influences (ie the Dead Kennedy's cover 'Nazi Punks Fuck Off' of later years).\n\nQuite simply if you hate pop-rock and their coiffured MTV-kin, or just want to make your ears bleed, listen to the album that gave heavy metal a shotgut at the base of the neck and cold shiver down the spine.\n",
        "\nFor those that have the DVD, this CD is something they can live without (unless you got the CD first like, then you\u2019ll probably want to see the show live). For those that don\u2019t usually go for live albums for whatever reason, they should probably pass this by, but if you like these kind of albums, there\u2019s more than a decent offering here, especially for fans of the group.\nAll the Napalm Death elements are here. Danny Herrera shows why he\u2019s the best drummer the band ever had, Jesse Pintado delivers crunchy riffs, Mitch Harris does the same but also adds something special with his high-pitched screams, Shane Embury plays his bass with ease and perfection, and Greenway growls and screams in the way that only he knows how.\n\u201cPunishment In Capitals\u201d is a great live album, with a nice raw sound to it. Despite Greenway\u2019s vocals not being what they could be, and the tracks on selection in need of some older material than it has, \u201cPunishment In Capitals\u201d is a pleasure to listen to, simply because it\u2019s both well played and raw. Jesse, Mitch and Shane all put on a great show with extremely good guitar/bass playing, with Mitch also screaming like a little girl, Danny\u2019s drum playing is perfect as he keeps the band in-time and Greenway\u2019s vocals are heavy with a unique sound to them. Basically, they show why they\u2019re considered to be one of the greatest death/grind bands to ever bless us with their music.\nSo, if you haven\u2019t already seen the DVD, \u201cPunishment In Capitals\u201d is worth listening to. I\u2019d only really recommend this if you like live albums or you want to hear what\u2019s on offer on the DVD version, either way, if you like what you hear, than checking the DVD and it\u2019s extra features, would be the next step. For a live album, this is excellent.\n",
        "\nI for one always enjoy live DVDs, as they give you a chance to see what you can\u2019t always see firsthand. While never a perfect substitute for the real thing, a recording of a good show can be immense fun to watch (or just listen to). That\u2019s why I enjoyed what was on show here.\nAfter a lengthy behind the scenes intro that you\u2019ll watch maybe once, the mayhem begins. From the first riff of the classic \u201cLucid Fairytale\u201d, Napalm Death put on a crushing performance. Excellently executed riffs, check. Distorted bass played by a fuzzy-haired fat guy, check. Exemplary percussion, check. Growls and screams, check. Well it seems that all ingredients are present, and indeed they are. \nTaking place in a small venue with a small stage, absolutely packed, \u201cPunishment In Capitols\u201d shows Napalm Death at their best. On the visual side of things, this release gets a top score. Constant movement added to the clearly brutal rapport between fans and band, this show is nothing short of chaotic. People interact with the band on the already packed stage (from singing along, to requesting songs), mosh like gorillas, stage-divers pump into the band while they\u2019re playing, \u2018Barney\u2019 Greenway moves back and forth the whole time, it\u2019s fucking amazing to watch. All this action isn\u2019t hindered in the least by the camera work. Steady where it needs to be and a decent shot-changing rate that doesn\u2019t tire but only adds to the overall experience. There\u2019s even icing on the cake with some little incidents, including Greenway accidentally getting kicked in the balls and shortly losing his singing voice. The extra footage from others concerts admittedly isn\u2019t as good, but it\u2019s still satisfactory. Visually this DVD is as good as anyone could wish for. And that brings me to the meat and fat, the music.\nI\u2019ll start off stating that there are some downfalls musically. For one the track-listing, although good (it contains mostly tracks from \u201cEnemy of the Music Business\u201d) could have really done with some older material, but then again, the material they did play was wisely chosen in it\u2019s own right, with a good amount of classics and new stuff, including a flawless playing of the at the time yet-to-be-released, \u201cNarcoleptic\u201d. Another slight downfall is Greenway\u2019s vocals. While he is a great vocalist, his voice isn\u2019t what it used to be. That\u2019s not to say that he doesn\u2019t perform well, as he does. Both his growls and his screams are excellent, but his voice is slightly lacking at moments. Also, he seems to skip a lot of words in the lyrics to keep up with music, which is understandable as he spilling his guts screaming, a feat that\u2019s definitely not easy. My one major grudge with him has more to do with me being a Napalm Death fan than his vocals; for once I\u2019d like to hear \u201cUnchallenged Hate\u201d with the original screams instead of growls. Anyway, moving on.\nThe rest of the band all bring the pain. Pintado and Mitch Harris both keep the riffs crunchy and blasting, despite both being pushed and shoved by crazed fans, Mitch further pleases with his awesome long, high pitched screams, Embury plays his bass perfectly, even treating the crowd to mini solos between songs and Herrera blasts out endless beats of perfection, too bad his drums were louder in the mix. \nMusically, this DVD is of the highest quality, with such crushing tracks as The Dead Kennedy\u2019s \u201cNazi Punks Fuck Off\u201d, the classic \u201cScum\u201d, the obliterating \u201cSuffer the Children\u201d and \u201cThe World Keeps Turning\u201d, the catchy \u201cConstitutional Hell\u201d and the infamous \u201cYou Suffer\u201d (what\u2019s a Napalm Death show with \u201cYou Suffer\u201d?). If you\u2019re a Napalm Death fan, than this should be a worthy purchase. A cure for the common complaint? If that complaint is godly grind, then yes.\n",
        "\nThere's quite a difference to be found between this album and previous Napalm Death albums. Besides the fact that this is the first Napalm Death album to feature ex-Terrorizer guitarist Jesse Pintado and ex-Righteous Pigs guitarist Mitch Harris, it's also the first Napalm Death album to feature Mark \"Barney\" Greenway (former Benediction), a frontman that would become one of the key ingredients for the most important grindcore band in existence, on vocals. As is natural, 'Harmony Corruption' has few similiarities with previous masterpieces 'Scum' and 'From Enslavement to Obliteration', due to the fact that besides the drummer, Mick Harris, and the bassist, Shane Embury - who joined on the latter album, Napalm Death is now a totally different band which is following in a different direction from that of 'Scum' and the band's following album (a direction also evident on the 'Mentally Murdered' EP, the band's last studio recording with vocalist Lee Dorian and guitarist Bill Steer).\nFirst of all, Napalm Death's first two albums are straight-up grindcore, while in 'Harmony Corruption' the band tries to play more traditional death metal, even if in the end the result dips in and out of grind. But that's not to say that the members of the band don't bring the goods. Far from it. \nFor starters, both guitarists (Pintado and Harris) both put on a terrific display of riffing. From the slow grinding riffs of Pintado to the ferocious song structures of Harris, it's evident that accidentally getting two guitarists was the best thing that Napalm Death never meant to do. From start to end, this album packs a shit load of memorable and crunching riffs - quite a few, which have been written by the bands fuzzy haired bassist, Shane Embury. Ah, yes. Shane...\nWell, there's no way any listener could have a gripe with Shane's excellent bass playing. Not only is he the glue in the band, taking on both playing and writing duties, but he also lays down the low end of the album better than anyone could hope for. \nFilling out the drums 'n' bass department is Mick Harris. It's not that I don't like his drumming on this album, his timing is perfect, his blast beats are ripe as hell and his breaks are fast as fuck, but the production of his drums can either drag down someone's enjoyment of this album or elevate it emmensely - a kinda hit and miss affair when taking into consideration the guitar playing of the album, also plaguerized with the same lame production. Someone has to question a producer's production goals when they listen to a recording that in the long run tends to tire with it's overall sound...\nLast but not least, we have Barney's brutal vocals. Not only does he show off his talent at guttural vocals (a talent that is less evident in future recordings) but shows some great lyrical inspiration on this album. From songs that attack conniving realigous fanatics, to lyrics about the decimation of our eco-system, to lyrics about drug abuse. For those that like some intelligent substance and opinion in their music, they're sure to find it. On the other hand, those that aren't seeking for such 'secular' aspects can rest assured find plenty in Barney's distinctive vocal style, which consists of some great good old death metal growling (then there's also the added bonus of quest appearances by Obituary's John Tardy and Deicide's Glen Benton on 'Unfit Earth').\nIn the end I'm sure that any Napalm Death, grindcore, or even death metal fan for that matter, can find plenty here to satisfy themselves with. Especially if they make it a goal to overlook the sloopy, hindering production. Definately a great way to break in a new line-up, with a killer album for all fans of the extreme.\n",
        "\nOkay, so there's 3 EPs on this, which I'll go ahead and break down into sections:\n\nI: \"Mass Appeal Madness\"\nFirst 1 1/2 songs are kinda boring, but it gets progressively better. The production is certainly a step up from \" Harmony Corruption\" as the guitars are actually audible and the drums don't sound so damn cheap. Better songs as well. They remake one of the tracks from \"FETO\" with Mick Harris doing most of the vocals (interesting). Rating: 75\nII: \"Suffer The Children\"\nFeatures tracks from the \"Harmony Corruption\" sessions. In other words, when fast playing is going the guitars are 100000% non-existent in the mix. Vocals and drums over-power everything (the drums sound like utter crap, that snare head must've cost about $1!!!). They completely butcher \"Siege Of Power\" from \"Scum\" and the outro never seems to end. The title track has some good riffs that actually sound like old JP (somewhat anyway), I'm only giving it an 11 because of this (would've gotten a big fat ZERO otherwise!!). Rating: 11\nIII: \"Mentally Murdered\"\nThe last recording with Lee Dorrian and Bill Steer. Clearly, you can see the \"morphing\" in their style taking place. Songs are more structured yet still fast/aggressive/semi-short. Dorrian's voice clearly got help with a vocal harmonizer, but I still think it was his best vocal performance in the band. The solo on the 4th track was also probably the best solo Bill Steer ever did with any band. Easily the best production on the album as well, the only thing not very audible is the bass (all distorted bass sounds lame anyway). I'd actually have to say this is ND's finest moment!!! Rating: 90\n\nSo, I combined the 3 numbers to get my average, though I'd say the third EP alone makes this worth owning!!!\n",
        "\nim sure if your reading this you know the general sound of Naplam Death, so i will not go into what they sound like.\n\nIf you are in to nalpalm death buy this cd. it holds only the best songs they have recorded over the many years of napalm death, and a few additional bonus'. the last few songs on the second cd are live and a few songs are originals not before released. classic songs like \"you suffer\", at a huge 5 seconds, \"greed killing\", \"breed to breathe\", and \"suffer the children\", will induct new napalm fans and should really convert any napalm sceptics.\n\nthe two cds both give different insights to the band, and also (if you look up the time when the song was recorded) show a logical progression with each cd they have made, during different stages of napalm's history.\n\nthe booklet that comes with the cd, holds interviews with Barney Greenway, the vocalist (benediction), and an interview from Shane Embury, the bassist (lockup, unseen terror) which give an insight to what Naplam death are about and why they make the music the way they do. also contained in the booklet is a low down on every song on the second cd. it also comes with a time line of when the band was formed, and how Naplam death has progressed over the years with band members leaving etc.\n\nTruely a great cd.\n",
        "\ngrindcore has been going down these days, bands like Pig Destroyer, Circle of Dead Chilren and Origin have been giving grind a new name. Napalm Death have continued time after time to take back the music that they rightfully created. Enemy of the Music Business is not only a slap in the face to all grind bands, but a big ol' slap in the face to the music business. Napalm Death's origonal sound teams up with aggressive animosity towards those who have screwed them over in their 20 year existence. This album presents the idea that no matter how much you screw a band over that you cannot kill them, they will continue to fuck you as you try to fuck them (if that makes any sense). Songs like 'Next on the List' and 'the public gets what the public doesn't want' are perfect examples of bands like Napalm Death who are fed up with pop culture and how the media feeds the general public (MTV is the biggest example). If you dont like us, then eat shit. Like every other ND album, this one send the message of rebellion towards an infection that is the high masses of corporations and government. Musically this album serves up the best ND has to offer with their latest line up. They combine old school grind with their newer signature grind that will never be mimicked. The combination of old punk-metal and classic grind, Napalm Death makes a sound that cannot be ingnored.\n",
        "\nGrindcore...the very creation of Napalm Death, 'Scum' ended the race for fastest and heaviest in the music world. The original line-ups (yes I said line-ups, because there are essentially two different bands on this album, one per side) combined metal, hardcore, and punk with their own sick, demented, twisted creativity and points of view which evolved into the most brutal music ever made. Mick Harris's technique called the \"blast beat\", forever changed the genre of death metal. Virtually every death metal band to start after 'Scum' made use of the blast beat. The music on 'Scum' is brutal, fast, and speaks of human nature, and political unrest and world issues. The songs are short, which is why there are 28 tracks crammed on, which equal less than 30 minutes worth of listening. The vocals are all but impossible to decipher, which also had an influence on death metal. The guitars are grinding and pound brutality into your skull like a jackhammer. 'Scum' may have been the album that started grindcore, but the influence that it had on death metal is undeniable. To fully get what the music on 'Scum' is all about I advise that you check it out...NOW! Be open minded, as 'Scum' takes several listens to fully absorb.\n",
        "\nI have been criticized quite a bit lately for supposedly \"not liking any Grindcore,\" so let me tell you about a band that I truly enjoy listening to: Napalm Death.\n\nNapalm Death is Grindcore that actually functions as music instead of mindless noise. The guitars have an incredible sound that is clear and manages to stay in some sort of order so that the listener does not get totally lost in the process. The riffs are brutal and manage to convey the harsh feeling of the music without losing all semblance of order in the process. The drums actually have different rhythms and are turned DOWN in the mixing process so they don't sound like a group of terrorists burst into the fucking recording studion and gunned down the entire band. The beat is followable and clear--you can actually THRASH and HEADBANG to this music instead of spending your time wondering what the fuck is going on. The bass is actually AUDIBLE in the production, so there is, in fact, a solid bass line underneath all this brutality, and it really enhances the sound as opposed to the \"shadow\" basses that completely mirror and get lost in the bass drum. Finally, the vocalist has a brutal and harsh death/grind voice that goes perfectly with the music and doen't sound like random ass gurgles (Cock & Ball Torture) or something inanely stupid like that.\n\nHighlights. The Great Capitulator is an awesome song that starts out with a really cool guitar introduction before heading into a pure assault of drum beats and vocalized emotion on top of insane riff shredding. Lowest Common Denominator starts out with some brutal opening riffs before heading into a headbanging frenzy in the main theme courtesy of the very well-done 1-2 beat of the drums. Out of Sight, Out of Mind starts off with a blood-curdling scream that is done above some really catchy riff work from the guitars and a really interesting drum \"roll\" pattern that is quite unique in terms of anything I've heard from bands of a similar vein.\n\nSo, let me say this loud and clear for the benefit of all: I DO NOT HATE ALL GRINDCORE. I don't like the subgenre as a whole since it tends to produce mindless acts of stupidity in the name of \"music,\" but there are exceptions to the rule, like Fuck...I'm Dead. Napalm Death may be an exception to the rule, but what a motherfucker of an exception it is! This is THE definitive Grindcore band and should be bought by any Grind or Death fan immediately in addition to anyone looking to get into the scene.\n",
        "\nSuch an awful, directionless album. At times they do a decent job of keeping the riffs in the foreground, and generally uptempo (without resorting to stupid br00tal tricks)... then they forget they ever knew how to play their instruments and they totally resort to said tricks. It is grindcore, after all.\n\nGreatest example of this schizophrenia... Unchallenged Hate - they start off with probably the best opening riff of the entire album. Some solid death growls and the song seems like it's heading somewhere pretty good, and even when they speed it up at 0.29, it becomes a total fucking headbanger. It's similar to March of the S.O.D. in how it alternates fast and midpaced sections. More solid thrash riffs come along, and nifty growls and overall, this is a great song... so far...\n\nThen, at 1.16, it's like they spliced in an entirely different song. Total grindcore drumming, and it's a new vocalist... a raped ferret or something from the best I can tell. What the fuck is up with that interlude?? It just turns into some mindless crap that is at best tolerable, at worst annoying.\n\nThe rest of the album doesn't quite match either extreme. They have their fair share of decently long songs... though even they suffer through flaws. They all seem to need a \"br00tal\" section with really tickticking drums - Mass Appeal Madness, Suffer the Children, etc etc. What would be decent death-thrash is ruined by the core shit.\n\nThe highlight... Siege of Power because it stays away from that shit and just ends up being a thrasher in the end. If the whole album were like this, it would be decent. Not spectacular, but kinda decent. It sounds a bit uninspired, and I'm not sure if that's a fault of the mix being a bit blurry or the songs being very samey... not great stuff, but I'm sure I could find a way to bang along to it. If only the whole album were like this, of course - none of this core shit, or the stupid interlude \"Harmony Corruption\" (I mean what the fuck, man??). \n\nThere's a real stretch of songs after that that kinda blur together because they all have a bunch of \"urrgghs\" and a bunch of random grindcore sections, and maybe one memorable riff (Walls of Confinement, 1.28).\n\nThen there's a matter of the last six songs on the album, which take a total of under 8 minutes... that's Regurgitated Cow Fetus territory, and it's clearly marked, so stay the fuck off the property. It's just pretty much unadulterated crap. Especially \"Understanding\". SEVEN seconds? Gimme a break.\n\nSo, the album does have its redeeming moments... it's not ALL crap, but even the good stuff is missing something, and the terrible stuff is just terrible!\n",
        "\nIt's always cool to listen to a new NAPALM DEATH CD, it's a bit of warmness in your so cold heart of ice!\nBut I've got quite mixed feelings about this new one: this is in the same vein than their 2/3 last releases, but I find it less expressive and intense on an emotional point of view! And even if there are still a bunch of cool riffs, some guitar parts doesn't sound that good (too common for Napalm!) \nThe style hasn't changed much, this is still a mix of Death/ Grind/ Crust/ Hardcore/ Sludge... but there are a few new elements such as the heavier CELTIC FROST like part on the first track (Barney even growls \"Procreation of the wicked\" on this riff. I may also compare them to USUR\u00a8PER on this part as this American band sounds like old Celtic Frost with a more powerful sound) or some few Black metal influences riffs.\nThis is a cool CD with nice parts, but there aren't so much \"Hits\" or incredibly killing riffs (they doesn't dig that much under the surface of the iceberg). There are still some nice parts that stands out particularly (the 2 last minutes of the 2nd track, the 5th one or some more powerful one) but these parts are ways less numerous.\nNotice the comeback of a punky tempo beat Napalm didn't use since the time of the \"F.E.T.O\" LP or \"Mentally murdered\" MLP.\nTo conclude I'll say it's not one of the best NAPALM DEATH CDs! Their 3 previous albums were far better! What we've got here is a CD \u00e0 la NAPALM DEATH played by NAPALM DEATH themselves...\nI understand it can please someone who haven't listened so much to N.D, but I expect more from a band whose members release so much stuffs (Another tribute to old bands is on its way, the DEFECATION new CD, DVDs, and other projects we don't know).\n",
        "\nIts been a long time since an album literally grabbed me by by neck and pounded the flying shit out of me, but all has changed since i bought this album. On the first spin i was all over the fucking place!!! The album just picked me up and slammed me against the wall.... how can you not get floored? this album is 28 tracks (well 27.... 'Multinational Corporations' is an intro with no real substance, but still good for what it is) of pounding brutality... harsh Vocals, pounding fast as fuck Drums, a peculiar but awesome as hell Muddy Bass Sound, some great Guitar work..., good riffs, wherever there was a solo it was a good one, especially the one contained within 'Siege of Power'.... most songs ran under :50, but thats the unique beauty of Grindcore...\n\nMany would consider this an infuential album, and so do i... this was one of the very first albums to get the Grind movement.. well, moving! And you can't forget the odd story behind this album... as the other reviewer stated, the line up changes on Side A and B and how there are no original members of Napalm Death to this day. A lot of people have had problems with production, i'm one of those people who can listen to something with horrible production and care the slightest bit (like Cracass 'Reek of Putrefaction', production is irrelevant..) But i personally think the production is good!\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of Napalm Death (unless you're into newer ND) or just a fan of Grindcore in general.... listen to it at its best, pick up Napalm Death's 'Scum'.. you won't be disappointed!\n",
        "\nIn this 1990 release the short grindcore songs (under a minute) that Napalm Death played on Scum and From Enslavement to Obliteration are gone and replaced by songs in the four to five minute range. Given that, the intricate riffing, and the many tempo changes and complexity, one could certainly argue that this is grind influence death metal rather than grindcore. Napalm Death itself appears to note the ambiguity throughout the liner notes, where they refer to \"deathgrind\" and thank just about every major death and hard thrash band of the day, including Morbid Angel, Death, Obituary, Sepultura, and others. In fact, John Tardy of Obituary and Glenn Benton of Deicide lend backing vocals to the song \"Unfit Earth,\" which rules!\n\nThe music is, per usual, 100% rip your face off aggressive. Barney Greenway's vocals completely own most death growlers. The riffs are intense, complex, and ever changing. And Mick Harris is an absolute wildman on the drums, going from blast beats to Dave Lombardo double bass drumming as appropriate. The production, particularly on the drums, is just perfect. Scott Burns did this album and it sounds great.\n\nFor too long I dismissed Napalm Death as all attitude but little in the way of musical talent. Harmony Corruption demonstrates that this band was able to mature and improve radically in just a couple years, while still maintaining 100% of the aggression that defined their early grindcore releases. This album completely slays and belongs on the shelf next to your top death metal albums.\n",
        "\nNapalm Death... the underappreciated godfathers of grind, seize their throne with Enemy of the Music Business. THIS is how its fucking done kids... 14 massive, violent, reckless tracks of insane blastbeats and riffs. Napalm manage to capture a bit of FETO's intensity and splice it with modern production. \n\nI am not familiar with ND's 90s material, widely reknowned as tripe, so I won't go there (to be fair, the 90s Napalm I have heard is good). \"Taste the Poison', \"Blunt Against the Cutting Edge\". Songs like these are memorable, propulsive, and feral. It sounds like Napalm have a reason to be discontent with the establishment again. \"Can't Pay Won't Play\" is my favorite... just fucking excellent, riff after riff, all the blasts and venom that makes old school ND so killer.\n\nAlright before this review degenerates into a necropolis catalogue adjective fest I'll end it... Enemy is an excellent release and a good introduction to Napalm Death. I think it's their best album and a lot of fans agree.\n",
        "\nWell...this has so many fuckin great speeded up songs that I think I\u2019ll just generalize it... Napalm Death's first record \"Scum\" is a landmark in grindcore. Probably one of the founding albums of the impressive extreme sound that had as the other godfathers of it, the fantastic...well you know them...Carcass. This one is a festival of average 40 seconds, totally fast, ripping apart and annihilating grind authentic beasts. It terms of comparison, it doesn't have the brutality of \"Reek of Putrefaction\" from Carcass but it is sure good enough to put your neighbour at your door with a rifle next to your head telling you to shut the fuck up...\n\nThis album has a lot of peculiarities inherent to it. The first one is the fact that none of the Napalm Death members that recorded this one is on the actual line up, so, you can call those five guys everything today but not Napalm Death, that's the way it goes...The other interesting peculiarity is the fact the original release had two sides, side A and side B that were played by two completely different line-ups. Probably the first time this ever happened in a metal record (or in any other record!!!). The first line up is the closest to the original Napalm Death that went from punk to an aggressive grindcore and was formed by: Nick Bullen - Bass/Vocals, Justin Broadrick - Guitars and Mick Harris - Drums. These guys recorded the first side of \"Scum\" that went from \"Multinational Corporations\" to \"You Suffer\u201d. ATTENTION, these guys are not credited on the original release but they actually played that bulk of songs...\nThe side B of \"Scum\" was recorded by: Lee Dorrian - Vocals, Bill (yeah, the guy from Carcass) Steer - Guitars, Jim - Bass and Mick Harris - Drums. There's a little difference of sound from one line up to another but the psychological slaughter is practically the same in the two of them, and it goes from \"Life\" to \"Dragnet\" \n\nThe production is not so good and it could have been a little better if the producer had made them sound more then a garage band recording that was about to record their latest demo. \n\nAbout the guys, Nick Bullen and Lee Dorrian really throw it out completely in some really brutal kind of singing...no sorry, screaming, Bill Steer's guitar sound could be a little bit better than Justin' sound but it's not bad after all. The bass has practically the same sound for the two guys, a really distorted and grinding low tone that fits like hell on those little demonstrations of pure killing and the drumming by the survivor member Mick Harris is just fucking hyperactive...that guy must have sipped some pretty decent gallons of fuel to play like that...it's so fast that he probably got his arms on fire in the middle of recording...\n\nShane Embury, the current bassist is now the closest member to be an original one, as he entered Napalm Death after the recording of the B side to join them on tour. Bill Steer recorded this one and the next album with Napalm Death after Carcass were put on hold because of drummer Ken Owen studies. He then left to record permanently with Carcass. The cover art for this album was made by Jeff Walker, the bassist/vocalist from Carcass.\n\nAll of the songs, although being very similar, never are enough to get you bored with that brutality and speed. The really remarkable song on this record is the Guinness record for the fastest song ever (something that even S.O.D weren't capable of doing...). \"You Suffer\" is the fastest and brutal, but really brutal song ever recorded in metal. This one goes in time like this: 00:00:00.10. Well, if you don't believe it, you have to get \"Scum\" to verify it...\n\nAbsolute Grindcore classic...an absolute must have for these three reasons:\n\n1 - Two different line ups\n2 - Bill Steer (Carcass) on Guitars, Lee Dorrian (Cathedral) on Vocals and original drummer Mick Harris\n3 - 28 Devastating, brutal, vomiting horror classics\n\nGet it...NOW!!!!!!!!\n",
        "\nAhhhh, a new Napalm Death release is always a good thing. Not always an original and unique release, but the fans keep buying the cds and the band still keeps pumping out the brutality after 20 years. This cd is a return to older style ND while still staying modern. Oh yea, the old logo is back! \n\nThe basic idea of this cd is the bands dislike for the music industry, as the band had problems with before this was released. The songs are fast and come right for your throat. If you have heard ND before, you know what to expect music wise. Barneys shouting/yelling style vocals, the fast drums and the always awesome riffs. Jesse & Mitch pump out some killer riffs that literally make some of the songs awesome.\n\nThe cd opens with Take the Poison, which is short and sweet. Track 3, Constitutional Hell, is one of my faves on the cd and has some of the best riffs on the cd. Another great track is can't play, won't play. \n\nBasically, if you like a few songs on this cd, you will like the whole thing. If you can't get into Napalm Death, then this cd probably won't change your opinion. Its a good cd and its great to see the band still putting out great cds, but after getting to track 9 or so, it starts to get a little old, but that doesn't take away from very much in the end.\n"
