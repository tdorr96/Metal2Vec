        "\nThis is a rather curious release that barely registers a blip in not only heavy metal history, but heavy metal concert history. There\u2019s nothing real spectacular here, none of the bands have much in common, all coming from different record labels and not all of them were even thrash (which I'll get to)! I said \u201cwhat the hell is this?\u201d back in the day upon seeing this at a store, getting it for Candlemass, which turned out to be a mistake (not because of them, but for the whole release).\n\nIt starts off decently enough with D. A. M.\u2019s opener of \u201cTotal Destruction\u201d but that doesn\u2019t last for long. As a guitar player friend of mine said when I showed parts of the video to later (who\u2019d want to sit through the whole thing? Well, *other* than die-hard fans of most or all bands, I mean), \u201cdude, I\u2019m hearing wrong notes\u201d, yep, indeed, the guitarist was messing up. One of their songs ended almost as soon as it began, being a very fast, short thrash song, only being like a minute long.\n\nNow, I know an opinion of some internet stranger such as myself can\u2019t account (nor possibly count) for everything (or anything), but when I was underwhelmed, my friend was and there was barely a response from who knows how many members of the legendary Hammersmith Odeon venue\u2019s (where it was filmed) audience, well, let\u2019s just say this didn\u2019t make us fans of D. A. M., to say the least.\n\nDark Angel closed this out with a couple of amusing antics, one of which involved, early on, the vocalist finding his microphone not working after trying to fiddle with it, which he threw and walked off the stage in disgust. The rest of the band didn\u2019t miss a single note! He returned not long afterwards with a new mic. Also near the end, he told the camera person to show \u201cthem\u201d (saying \u201cno, not me\u201d, as he meant the audience), and instructed everyone to raise their middle fingers, which was, I\u2019ll admit, juvenile but funny to see thousands, if not 10,000 or more people do just that.\n\nUnfortunately their material, even though very fast, heavy, and well-played, wasn\u2019t that great, but I\u2019m not some doofus who heard some Dream Theatre (or Ghost nowadays, which, after seeing their \u201cRats\u201d video, makes me laugh at religious whiners who protest them when they barely seem to be metal at all) and said \u201cI\u2019m a metalhead!\u201d without being able to handle death and/or thrash metal. I\u2019ve been a metalhead since 1983 or \u201884 since high school and have plenty of death and/or thrash metal cds (Bolt Thrower\u2019s Those Once Loyal should be here any day now in the mail, for example, as I never got it back in the day), yet even when I got both of Sabbat's releases back then (along with Coroner\u2019s R. I. P. as well), I STILL muttered \u201cslow down\u201d several times while watching Dark Angel, plus my friend said, after just a couple of minutes of them, \u201cdude, you can fast forward...\u201d. Aside from only some bits and pieces here and there, the only song of theirs I liked was the closer of \u201cWe Have Arrived\u201d.\n\nNow, in between those bands was the mighty CANDLEMASS, the best of them all (in my opinion), yet they\u2019re not even thrash! I believe the majority of their material over the years has been slow, but heavy doom (I'm going to start getting caught up on their old stuff soon) and the only thrash song of their four was \u201cThrough the Infinitive Halls of Death\u201d, which was kind of odd. They sounded stronger live (or at least on this release they did) as opposed to on cd, what with the drums sounding much better, the guitars were mixed better than on their Ancient Dreams release (sounding thicker) and singer Messiah Marcolin sounded really strong. Only thing wrong here was not playing anything from their Nightfall cd, although \u201cThe Bells of Acheron\u201d was an interesting choice to play.\n\nI\u2019ll admit 60% isn\u2019t a very high vote, but the good elements that made up the release include the following:\n\n1. Candlemass, of course!\n2. Pretty decent sound; again, Candlemass sounded even better live than on some of their studio material, and the other bands sounded good too, no drums that sounded like they were tin cans being hit or anything\n3. Decent video quality for the time\n\nUnfortunately as far as the rest goes\u2013and going hand-in-hand with #3 from the above list\u2013even though it was good to make the bass players the stars of the show, most of the guitar solos were missed by the camera, which is ridiculous. I don\u2019t know what this cost to make but I\u2019m going to assume it was low budget; an extra camera/person or two would\u2019ve helped. Post editing was also poor, as a fair about of the drum synchronicity was screwed up upon release of the tape.\n\nThey also could\u2019ve done a better job with artists; granted, for those that are fans of two, if not all three bands, they would rate this video higher than myself. Because I can drop my Candlemass bias (again, they\u2019re not even thrash metal except for one song on here!) and state that, as far as Noise Records artists go, instead of D. A. M. they could\u2019ve substituted them (along with Candlemass if need be as well) with Coroner, Rage, Celtic Frost, Sabbat, even the mighty Helloween, but playing \u201cwhat if\u201d here is pointless since they were limited to who was playing on that day, acquiring the rights to said groups and maybe another factor or two, I\u2019m just pointing this out.\n\nAs far as I go, I ended up transferring the Candlemass onto an all-music vcr tape of mine and then tossing the original. With it literally being 30 years after its initial release and I\u2019m the very first person on here to review this only fairly ok tape at best, I think that says it all, pretty much.\n",
        "\nCandlemass deserve your respect because they are gods, and there are few who would argue with that. However, I can\u2019t be the only one who looked askance at the sort of \u201ccomeback\u201d that the epic doom Swedes have waged over the last few years. Performances with original vocalist Johan L\u00e4ngquist (who was only really a session member when the first album was recorded), a new album called The Door to Doom, and a spate of smaller releases: all this seems like the activity of a commercially-inclined band, particularly one that already \u201cretired\u201d from the studio. Marketing The Pendulum as an EP when it mostly contains shavings from a demo of unused cuts from the latest album sort of seems like another page in the same chapter. \n\nHowever, as I previously stated, Candlemass are gods and deserve your respect. You don\u2019t become a doom institution by recording mediocre stuff, and neither the new track here nor the offcuts seem like a poor man\u2019s scraps. I didn\u2019t expect to be saying that L\u00e4ngquist sounds a bit like ex-vocalist Robert Lowe, yet that\u2019s something I notice more in the middle age of both men. The sonic range of Candlemass generally remains lower now, so it makes sense for the singing to focus on mid-range power and emotion, while that partly affects the riffing choices too, in that the quintet know how to create ponderous weight in the most suitable manner and don\u2019t go darting off on power doom quests that often. That totally describes the character of \u2018Snakes of Goliath\u2019, which features an instance of Candlemass sticking a little too close to conformity, as anyone who knows the main riff from Sabbath\u2019s \u2018Iron Man\u2019 will agree. \u2018Porcelain Skull\u2019 arrives with more character, feeling like something from Death Magic Doom and breaking things down nicely after a couple of choruses. The title track here should obviously impress the most, since it gives the release its whole purpose: gladly, that\u2019s the case, packing more dynamics and a bit more zip in the riffing. \n\nNonetheless, I don\u2019t believe any of these cuts - not even \u2018The Pendulum\u2019 - lives up to the real capacities of Candlemass. Then again, I didn\u2019t expect too much, seeing as the last full-length was no more than solid, and most of this material didn\u2019t make it to The Door to Doom. And if I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s kind of lame to have 3 random, crappy interlude tracks among 6 on the whole EP. Use one for an intro maybe, but 3? Next time, just save the good stuff for a while, no?\n",
        "\nBefore I begin the review for Candlemass' twelfth studio album \"The Door to Doom\" in earnest, I need to both give a bit of history to the album and vent a little bit. Before the release of this album, Candlemass had been a live-only band just going around playing festival shows and riding the waves of their legendary status without contributing much. Now, since Robert Lowe was dismissed very shortly after the release of \"Psalms for the Dead,\" you might ask who was singing for them? Well, longtime friend of the band Mats Leven had been keeping the band afloat and giving them new life. Mats is an AMAZING singer with a great voice, fun stage presence, and is just a standup person. Now, if you're unfamiliar with Mats, let me show you how vital he has been to Candlemass and Leif Edling in general.\n\nMats was/is the singer of two different side projects Leif had. Both Abstrakt Algebra and Krux. Not only that, but he was there every single time Candlemass needed someone to help them. When Candlemass returned for their self-titled album, before they got Messiah back, who helped them demo songs and put things together? Mats Leven. After that album, before they recruited Robert Lowe for \"King of the Grey Islands,\" who was the one who did all of the demo work, and almost ended up as the real final singer for that album? Mats Leven. Now, Candlemass was a live band that Mats had done a fantastic job at fronting for half a decade. I believe that it was because of him wanting to put a studio footprint on a band he helped so much that Candlemass released two EPs with his voice on it.\n\nNow, we get to \"The Door to Doom.\" If you're unaware, Candlemass admitted that this record was almost 100% complete with Mats at the head of it. They have said that all that needed to be done was a final master. But suddenly, very close to the album's release time, original singer Johan Langquist is back, and Mats is out. Why? Money. It's really THAT simple. Candlemass wanted to bank as much money as they could with this release, and they realized that being able to hype up the return of an old singer would lead to more people who haven't listened to Candlemass in a decade or longer suddenly tuning in. Johan's name simply had bigger dollar signs than Mats' did. I needed to bring this up because I find this act to be disgusting. Mats was a good friend of the band, and with all he had done, he deserved better than this. He deserved his fair shake. If they'd released this album with him and it didn't sell the way they wanted, and they wanted to go with Johan next, I wouldn't blame them as much. But making Mats do all of the work both on this album and for the past 5 years only to kick him aside shows a disgusting lack of humanity for the sake of a few extra dollars. Because of the circumstances of this album, you are going to see a LOT of Johan vs. Mats comparisons, because I don't think it is fair to review this album as if Mats had nothing to do with it considering it was built with him in the band almost entirely.\n\nNow, since I got that out of the way, how is the actual ALBUM? Well...very good! You see, I think them releasing this album with Johan instead of Mats ended up doing them more harm than good. I think Candlemass did gain a bunch of ears back that hadn't been listening to them for a long time. But where most people expected this album to be Epicus Part 2, it's anything but. After all, the record was entirely written to be around Mats voice, so there was just no chance that could have happened. However, if you've been listened to other recent Candlemass material, this is a pretty good next step for where the Lowe era left off. Certain tracks Johan Langquist owns like he never left, while certain tracks are very clearly supposed to be for Mats to shine instead of him.\n\n\"Death's Wheel\" is probably the most clear track where the later is the case, to me. From start to finish, if you're at all familiar with how Mats sings, this one very obviously has his handwriting all over it. Every single vocal melody on this track is one where his gruff, husky voice would be a much better fit than Johan's more somber vocals it. Johan isn't the best 'screamer,' so a few times during the album where he belts out a scream, it's pretty lackluster. Mats is a better fit for screaming. The chorus in particular Johan tries his best to hit, but I just hear Mats voice the whole time. It's a solid track, but just doesn't feel right. \"Under the Ocean\" is the other song on this album that Johan can't quite hang in there with as well as Mats could have. It's a really good one, too. The intro riff is a very strange sounding one backed with somber acoustic guitars. For this quiet intro part, Johan is perfect, but once the song starts to pick up into the much heavier parts, especially the chorus, he just can't quite make it fit. The chorus is a chugging, heavy one with a fantastic riff and sounds of machinery clinking in the background. Try as he might to sound powerful, Johan just comes off a little bit flat during it. Meanwhile, Mats gruff powerhouse of a voice could have sold the chorus just the way it needed to be sold. The song's slow opening and interlude midway, as well as the heavy riffs still make it worth it, though.\n\n\"Black Trinity\" is a really great example of a track both Johan does justice to, but also one I could see Mats knocking out of the park. Once again, after a bit of a meandering intro, Candlemass show off why they're one of the prime riff writing groups in metal. It's a dark, sinister onslaught of a riff. Johan's low register fits pretty well in backing up the riff. I think he's the one building the riff instead of the opposite. My favorite part of the song is the pre chorus, which is where the track really screams 'Mats' the most. It's a really catchy and unique melody with just the right flavor of 'doom' in there. This is probably the track that I think would have fit Mats better, but give Johan a pass on. The closer \"The Omega Circle\" is just the reverse. I think Johan nails it better than Mats could have, but I can see Mats doing a good job here too. Both the slow intro and the heavier core verse riff is one where Johan's masterful art of forlorn and miserable beauty fit perfectly for. I think drummer Jan Lindh is the star of this one, though. His beats are exactly what the song needed. They're subtle changes all across the song, and during the pre chorus, his switch to double bass as well as his crack of high pitched cymbal give much needed flavor to the track.\n\nThe two tracks that I think are by far the best the record has to offer are pure Johan goodness. I honestly don't see Mats doing half as good a job as Johan on them. Now, maybe it's the rebel in me, but I always hate saying my favorite song on an album is the 'single.' Especially when Candlemass advertised the fact that Tony Iommi played a solo on it as if he was an integral part of the song. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure getting Iommi here was a dream come true for the band, and it's REALLY cool to see his name on a Candlemass record but...he just did a solo. Not only that, but, and this is said with all due respect, I don't think anyone would argue that Iommi's SOLOS are the best part of his particular craft. Yet Candlemass released this info like Iommi was part of the entire process of the production of this song. They have 'FEATURING TONY IOMMI' everywhere they can slap it. But there's no way I can deny just how incredible \"Astorolus\" is. It's in my top three favorite songs the band ever made, too. As a doom fan, this is everything you can ask for. A primal drum beat starts it off before a soul-crushing riff hits. The song backs off to a simple riff that Johan matches note for note. These verse parts feel like a hunter stalking prey, and then the subsequent explosive section is them going for the kill. It floats back and forth like this beautifully. The chorus is EVERYTHING, though. It's absolutely chilling and addictive. The echoes behind Johan's chorus lines sound like the screams of lost souls giving the listener a warning of the beast. It's perfect.\n\n\"Bridge of the Blind\" also deserves special attention. This is really the first time Candlemass had a straight up ballad, and it's exactly what a Candlemass ballad should be. The acoustic guitar and Johan are both at the top of the miserable doomy game. \"Bridge of the Blind\" is equal parts beautiful and sad. The chorus adds elements of foreboding within those two emotions. Once again, the chorus is everything to this song. It hits you right in the soul, and you feel the chorus done to your bones. Yet, it's still a very sing-able and catchy chorus despite the misery hiding behind it. If you sleep on \"Bridge of the Blind\" just because it isn't 'heavy,' you're doing yourself a grave disservice. This song proves two facts. That you don't always need electric guitar (besides the obligatory solo they add in) to make your song heavy if you can hit the right emotions and that you can still make something catchy without betraying your genre.\n\n\"The Door to Doom\" is a really stellar record. Sadly, the process of its creation leaves everyone a bit disappointed with it. Older fans will be disappointed that this is ABSOLUTELY not even CLOSE to being the second coming of the debut. Fans of Candlemass' more recent outputs are going to be disappointed that this album doesn't fully fit the singer who performs on the final product because it wasn't written for him. It just can't win. I really don't think there's a bad track on \"The Door to Doom,\" however, I also don't exactly think much of it at all ends up being outstanding either. \"Astorolus\" and \"Bridge of the Blind\" really tow a lot of that weight. \"The Door to Doom\" deserves more credit than it gets, but I also hope Candlemass has at least one more album in their bones to let the return of Johan Langquist stand on its own from the ground up. I also hope that Mats Leven gets a chance to shine like he deserves, even if it's with another band. If this is how Candlemass is to end their studio career, though, I leave satisfied.\n",
        "\nBefore the release of \"The Door to Doom,\" I used to be able to joke that my two favorite Candlemass albums were their first and their last. I know what you're thinking. This is a very odd album in their discography for me to love as much as I do. I strongly believe that the reason this album is often passed over is the very same reason why I adore it so much. Candlemass' eleventh studio album \"Psalms for the Dead\" adds in a TON of power metal elements. We've seen the band flirt with some power metal here and there, but they go harder on those elements here than ever before. For a normal Candlemass fan, I can see why this would leave some with a bit of a sour taste. However, I myself adore power metal just as much as I do doom, so to see them be married together like that is an absolute treat to me.\n\nWhat do I mean? Well, you need look no further than the opener \"Prophet.\" The song starts with a traditionally pounding Candlemass riff which echoes a warning of what is to come. Instantly, the song picks up with a faster, heavier riff fueled by double bass. Once again, a constant double bass beat isn't something entirely new to Candlemass, but isn't the most common thing in the world for doom, either. It drives the song forward similar to the role double bass plays in power metal. If that wasn't enough, the part of the song right after the second chorus SCREAMS power metal. It absolutely blows the top off the rest of the song. The accenting keyboards underneath it help both the riff and Robert Lowe's brilliant melodies. The melodies are perfect for accenting the style of riff, yet they are just forlorn enough to still be doomy. The hushed whispering vocals behind Lowe's main lines add that eerie element the section needed too. They feel almost whispered from the wind. The solo that follows this particular section is also without question one of the most melodic and powerfully uplifting solos Candlemass has ever displayed.\n\n\"Dancing in the Temple,\" while not quite as musically screaming power metal as \"Prophet\" trumps it thematically one thousand times over. \"Dancing in the Temple\" is fueled by sword and sorcery D&D style theming that is one hundred percent new and different for Candlemass. It is SUCH a breath of fresh air for the band, and the song in general is SO much fun. The chorus melodies are frantic and rushed in vocal quality, which aids the panicked disjointed nature of the new theme of the song. There are a bunch of short solos dispersed throughout the song that give it life, and the chorus is the best of all. The chorus has SO much power, and the sudden change in tempo along with the keyboards accenting the riff behind it really make it feel like a strange dance is being performed before your eyes. \"Dancing in the Temple\" very well could be the most unique and different song Candlemass has ever made, and it's SO incredible.\n\n\"Siren Song\" also delivers the same fantasy style theming, but in a MUCH, MUCH more 'Candlemass' way. The riff is a prime example of 'simple, but effective.' The riff is a tiring one in the best way possible. It's the kind of thing you can imagine hearing when you're exhausted from a long journey, but need to keep trudging along anyway. Robert Lowe's vocals soar across the entire track, and they help inspire this ominous hope that ultimately will not come to fruition. The 'rest' the listener is going to get after the riff tires them out is not the kind of rest one would want. They keyboard parts are at the top of their game here, and once again, \"Siren Song\" uses an almost calming keyboard and bass solo midway to breathe new life into it. \"The Killing of the Sun\" adds to new ideas for the band. It has a bouncier type of riff that is a bit on the catchy side for them. Robert Lowe's vocal melodies perfectly dance and groove across them. The variety this track brings is what really makes it stand out. It's both powerful and very catchy in its own way, and while it doesn't betray Candlemass as a band, it's certainly not the type of material they've ever really done very much of.\n\nThere are definitely still enough songs that are more 'traditionally' Candlemass to give you a great fill of doom, though. \"The Lights of Thebe\" has some of my favorite riffing on the album. The main riff is incredibly catchy, but also has that somber doom element to it. It also has a bit of a middle-eastern flavor to me, and once again has more fantasy-type themes. While \"The Lights of Thebe\" might not be the most ground-breaking song, the combo of catchy and doomy make it incredibly memorable. \"The Sound of Dying Demons\" is pure old-school style Candlemass. The opening pounding drum beat sets up for the doom-ridden riff. All the while, the subtle background effects of wind, rain, and soft chanting give the track a primeval and deadly sound. Robert Lowe demonstrates a masterful use of vocals fitting the riff and tone perfectly. He's haunting and eerie once again, but then for the chorus, he kicks it up a notch with some more powerful, harsh, tortured vocals. Much like across most of \"Psalms for the Dead,\" the keyboards during the chorus which seem to be replicating a theremin add that extra and much needed layer of horror to the track.\n\nTo me, \"Psalms for the Dead\" has no duds during its entire runtime. I can certainly understand why the album carries mixed feelings, but for my taste, the variety they introduced on this album are both refreshing and loved. After the rather typical \"Death Magic Doom,\" this one was such an amazing breath of fresh air that the band needed. Unfortunately, a continuation of this record was not to be, as Robert Lowe was dismissed from vocal duties almost immediately after this album was released. We never got to hear any of these tracks done live with the lineup that recorded them, which is really sad for me. After the release of both \"Psalms for the Dead\" and Robert Lowe, Candlemass would pretty exclusively be a live band playing big festival shows and doing solely classic material. At the time, they said this album was the one they'd ride off into the sunset with, but (at time of writing) we get at least one more studio effort from this legendary band.\n",
        "\nCandlemass' tenth studio album \"Death Magic Doom\" is a bit of a head scratcher to me. Without a doubt, this one is a quality record in Candlemass' discography, but I feel like there's just something missing somewhere to elevate it into 'excellent' status. Their previous album \"King of the Grey Islands\" was mostly written before Robert Lowe joined the fold, so this is their first album with Lowe from start to finish, and I think it shows a bit in the songwriting. To me, a lot of these songs feel like the rest of the band is still testing the waters with Lowe. Both sides seem to be figuring out what they can bring to the table that the other side would like or not. It leads to a record with too much sizzle and not enough steak.\n\n\"Demon of the Deep\" is probably the song on the album that shows this unique hybrid of their styles best of all. When the mixture of styles clicked for the better. Most of this song relies on Robert Lowe's mixture of incredibly somber yet also very aggressive vocals. His ever-changing tone and style when the song goes from soft to heavy show what a fantastic vocalist he is. The song has pretty lackluster riffs all across the board, and yet Lowe makes this a very enjoyable song despite that. When you're a band like Candlemass that is famous for having incredible riffs, being able to save a song that is lacking in that department is truly an accomplishment. So much of an accomplishment that he couldn't even do it twice on the same album (more on that later.) The best part of the song by far is the very end of it. The entire tone of the song shifts into a much more melodic waltz which Lowe helps drive to a close with a miserable but beautiful repetition of chorus lines.\n\nMeanwhile, \"House of 1000 Voices\" is a track that sums up my feelings on the album in general. The song is a fine one with pretty good riffs, and a solid performance from Lowe, but there's just something missing from it to get it to that next level of 'amazing.' The main riff has a fantastic groove, and Lowe sings across it with a lot of power. The chorus also adds eerie keyboards to sell the mood more. I think the core problem I have with this song is that every part starts to overstay its welcome. The solos are all just a little too long without any stellar moments. There is a small bridge section after the first solo that goes nowhere and goes on one measure longer than it needed to. Then, the song swaps to a cool transition riff lead by Leif's bass which, again, goes a bit too long. Finally, we resume the initial parts of the track, which I feel is unnecessary. The song should have ended after the transitional part. It then takes FOREVER to finally end. This would have been a great song, but has absolutely no business being almost eight minutes. Despite my complaints, I like \"House of 1000 Voices.\" I just can't love it.\n\nNow, the song that steals the show without question is \"The Bleeding Baroness.\" It is no contest the best \"Death Magic Doom\" delivers. It opens with an absolutely haunting riff that Lowe's mystical melodies sell. It explodes into a harder, grinding riff full of power. The subtle lead guitar parts that accent Lowe's vocals during the verses elevate him higher. \"The Bleeding Baroness\" masterfully uses the magical element of breathing-room that many bands don't have a concept of. The constant swaps between softer and heavier; slow to slightly faster; eerie to aggressive; help the song always feel fresh. It leaves you hungry to see where the song goes next, and then satisfies with each fantastic part. \"Clouds of Dementia\" is the other song on the record I absolutely adore. The riffs and chorus are both the best the album has to offer. The chorus in particular is just melodic enough to be addictive without being too cheesy for the song itself. It is both catchy and powerful at the same time. The keyboards and switch from single bass drum pattern to double bass when it loops adds subtle power to drive it.\n\nSadly, I think the worst on the album are the very first two tracks it greets us with. \"If I Ever Die\" tries to be the stereotypical quicker paced Candlemass track to the album, but needed more time in the oven. The riffs that stand on their own are good enough to fuel the track, but the verse riffs are just simple chords being held for Lowe to sing over. His melodies are not good enough to save such an unacceptably lame verse riff, leading to a snore fest every time the vocals come in. About half way through the song, there is a part where the band starts and stops with Lowe singing during the pauses. This was clearly supposed to be the track's epic moment, but it comes out pathetically to me. The band is just smashing away at random notes, almost like they're unsure of what exactly they're playing. \"Hammer of Doom\" is by far one of the most boring tracks in the band's discography. The song has one of the most dull, boring, simplistic riffs you can ask for. These are the type of riffs that bands could get away with when the genre was new twenty years before this record was released, but just come off as lazy now. Lowe tries some quieter creepy vocals, but isn't at the top of his game trying to sell them. The lack of band support behind him doesn't help. When the song explodes with the chorus, it should be a breath of fresh air, but once again, we're greeted with an absolute lack of riff support. Towards the end, the song tries to speed up, but I've already been bored to tears, so I can't be bothered to care. Lowe's actual chorus lines are solid, but that's about all the song has going.\n\nWhen all is said and done \"Death Magic Doom\" is a mixed bag. Without a doubt I think it's the weakest of the three Robert Lowe-era albums. There are definitely a few gems of Candlemass brilliance to it, and even at the record's worst, it's more 'boring' than it is downright bad. The fat needed to be trimmed off this album. I also think the tour for this album was where tension between Lowe and Candlemass started. Candlemass has been very vocal in stating that they thought Lowe was a subpar live performer, and it's hard to disagree with them if you watch any live performance he does with them. His singing is on point, but he has absolutely no stage presence. It's odd to me, because I think he's the best studio singer Candlemass ever had pound for pound, but the worst live vocalist they had too. Luckily, though, Lowe'd have one more studio album left to give, and I think it's the best of them all.\n",
        "\nStep by step out of the doom trap: the last of the four classic Candlemass albums of their first period gives clear signals that the time of pure doom was coming to an end. The speedy instrumental \u201cInto the Unfathomed Tower\u201d was just the most significant of many elements that pointed into a new, slightly modified direction. (Thank you, by the way, that this piece did not open the record. I would have thought the speed setting on my record player was broken.) Already the first complete song, the galloping, great \u201cDark Reflections\u201d showed an affinity for pushing power metal and its smooth guitar lines stood in contrast to the slowly droning guitars of \u201creal\u201d doom formations. True purists beware!\n\nThe album needs a small warm-up period \u2013 the intro sounds lame and the spoken words performance is expressionless. There are three miniature cuts on \u201cTales of Creation\u201d and this is the most useless one. \u201cVoices in the Wind\u201d appears as a mystic intermezzo, inter alia due to the female voice and \u201cDawn\u201d is just there, neither adding value to the album nor doing any harm. Maybe these ingredients were necessary in view of the concept of the album, but honestly speaking, a concept is never more important than the music itself. Fortunately, there is not much to grumble concerning the musical content. The highlights have been placed at the beginning (the above mentioned \u201cDark Reflections\u201d) and the end. The quasi-title track \u201cA Tale of Creation\u201d is carried by a typical doom riff that flows organically into a lamenting bridge and a memorable chorus.\n\nBut the majority of the remaining songs do not stand in the shadow of these jewels. In alignment with the artwork \u2013 \u201cThe Creation of Light\u201d \u2013 they develop their own warm and bright rays. Melodramatic, dignified and sublime, these attributes apply to all titles. Unfortunately this does not mean that all songs are impressive. Both \u201cThe Edge of Heaven\u201d and \u201cSomewhere in Nowhere\u201d lack heaviness and exciting moments and so the B side cannot win the comparison with the first half of the album. \n\nNobody will miss the typical trademarks of the early Candlemass albums here. There is Messiah\u2019s nearly unique clear voice that always strikes the right tone with passion and expressiveness. The production does not fall victim to any weak points. Finally, the lyrics present a further portion of mystical content (\u201cA black star fell down on the night I was reborn\u201d \u2013 I wonder who can see a black star in the night). At the end, we have a good but not outstanding work. The gatefold album \u201cTales of Creation\u201d marks the ending of the first period of the Swedes and therefore it has gained more importance than its content justifies. Nevertheless, only very selective minds do not give this work a chance.\n",
        "\nReviewing a doom record is for me what you would call an away game in sport. As a thrash metal maniac, I'm all for energy, speed and shredding. Doom, on the other hand, stands for sluggishness, drummers who forget where their snare was in the middle of the song and... and I don't know what. Luckily there is Candlemass. Their debut is supposed to be cult (I never understood it, as I said, doom layman) and their second album seems rather toothless to me. (Outrage! Blasphemy!) They grew on me with \"Ancient Dreams\" - despite the kitschy artwork. It was the time when Messiah Marcolin gained a legendary reputation. This was based on three pillars: his always the same, terribly smelly stage clothes, a hairstyle (see back) that only let him walk through a door sideways and the almost unique, powerful, charismatic and sublime voice. \n\nBut Marcolin is not the only trump card of the Swedish five-piece on the album from 1988. Despite the compositional narrowness that the style dictates to its disciples, mastermind Leif Edling can score with a high degree of variance. The power riff of \"The Bells of Acheron\" sparks an otherwise absent forward momentum, while \"Epistle No. 81\" would make a suitable background noise for the prayer hour in the next best monastery. Unfortunately, the closer is also (probably for this very reason) the weakest track on the album. To return to sport, the song has the character of a 0:0 in football - there was something, you think, but nothing exciting.\n\nFortunately, there are also other calibres on \"Ancient Dreams\" which, by the way, is praiseworthily not overloaded with pathos, drama and tragedy. The B side is opened by \"Bearer of Pain\". It houses viscous verses, a chorus as if painted for Marcolin's voice and a surprising break after the second chorus, which lends the already good piece even more depth. The partly driving \"A Cry from the Crypt\" or the fatalistic and ominous \"Darkness in Paradise\" show Candlemass from their very good side as well. The latter track also impressively demonstrates one of the band\u2019s strongest weapons at the end of the eighties. Edlund managed to write catchy choruses seemingly effortlessly. This feature combined with relatively snappy guitar lines (\"Mirror Mirror\" emphasises this element right at the beginning) and the omission of the lowest speed levels results in a piece of black vinyl that still spreads its musical charm after 33 years. This is also a merit of the production. \"Ancient Dreams\" sounds heavy, warm and occasionally a little dark. If I were an insider in matters of doom, I would perhaps speak of an almost perfect setting for this style - but in view of my limited knowledge of this metier, I prefer not to presume that. But no doubt, I listen to a good, balanced mix that gives Messiah's voice the space it needs. \n\nIn retrospect, \"Ancient Dreams\" is still what it was probably meant to be from the point of view of its producers: the next logical step in the discography. Maturity meets musicality, a good flow is more important than endless repetition and no song suffers from anorexia, but no one puts on fat either. So we are simply dealing with a rightly self-confident doom record, I guess. But what do the 11 experts before me say about this piece of vinyl? 91% on average? I can largely understand that.\n",
        "\nAfter a successful albeit short lived return to form, Candlemass once again found themselves needing a singer. I'm sure the band was drawing many parallels to this same thing happening after \"Tales of Creation.\" The difference, however, was that this time the band was older, more mature, and realized that Candlemass was a legendary band worth keeping afloat. So what do you do when you're in a legendary band that needs a singer? Well, you recruit the singer from another top quality band of the same genre! In stepped Robert Lowe of Solitude Aeturnus, which might not be as synonymous and legendary a name as Candlemass, but has some of the most quality material you could ever ask for. The result was their ninth studio effort \"King of the Grey Islands.\" In my opinion, Robert Lowe is the best overall vocalist Candlemass has ever had (at time of writing at least.) Sure, he might not be quite AS perfectly fitting in his sadness as Johan Lanquist was on the debut, nor are his high notes as sailing and operatic as Messiah's best work...but as a total package, Lowe surpasses them all.\n\n\"King of the Grey Islands\" might very well be Candlemass' most thematically miserable and dreary album of all time. The true definition of 'doom' is more apparent here than anything else they've ever done baring maybe the debut. \"Destroyer\" does exactly what the title would suggest it'd do. The opening riff of the song is quite simple, but the way it trudges along; slowly picking up after each verse before slowing back down; gives off the feeling of a hopeless forced march. Robert Lowe reinforces this, too, by being able to make his vocals sounds 'tired' in a sense. He is able to deliver an incredible performance while at the same time sounding like he has given up all hope in life. The album's closer \"Embracing the Styx\" is just as miserable in the same vein. Taking very real themes of suicide and depression while connecting them to a fantasy-like story is tough enough, but the song's main riff has a rushing wave of heart-pounding adrenaline that makes it feel even more tense. \"Embracing the Styx\" is able to perfectly use tempo, space, and riffs to really drive home that dismal, doomy aura. The track's acoustic outro is one of the most beautiful ways you can end an album, too. The outro juxtaposing such a heavy song wraps everything together in a perfect bow.\n\n\"Of Stars and Smoke\" shows that this album has more to it than just dreary themes, though. While, once again, the opening riff is a very simple Candlemass-style riff, Robert Lowe really gets to shine more than anyone on this song. The chorus of the track is a very uplifting sounding one. On paper, this should be a death sentence for doom metal, but Lowe's beautiful notes which have the perfect amount of keyboard and distortion to them along with Lars' subtle but very powerful lead work backing and fueling his notes make this a very unique showing for Candlemass. The song almost has a subtle power metal feel, to me, that the band hinted at just a bit of during \"Into the Unfathomed Tower\" on \"Tales of Creation\" and would continue to dive a bit deeper into on future albums.\n\nOf course, this album isn't an entire one-eighty from the self-titled that came before it. \"Emperor of the Void,\" to me, has roots in \"Born in a Tank\" from the prior album. It once again has a faster tempo than Candlemass is famous for, and the raw pace makes it a GREAT head-banger. It really is a perfect opener for putting Robert Lowe on display, too. His verse vocals start gruff and a little rushed or frantic in a fitting way, and then for the chorus, he sings over a fantastic riff with an absolutely chilling display. It's a great pace-setter for the record. \"Clearsight\" is my pick for most underrated song on \"King of the Grey Islands,\" though. The song's main riff and drum beat give off a galloping feeling. The parts together really drive home a 'chasing' and desperate kind of feel that fits with the song's theming. It's frantic; like someone searching for something that is almost impossible to find. Lowe's verse melodies show a lot of what a strong higher register he has, too, and both the pre-chorus and chorus melodies have him harmonized with the riff and echoed across it for added punch. The mid-point in the song gives a little bit of a break for some much needed tone setting. A slow, simple riff plays behind a plethora of atmospheric sounds like wind and water that helps the song's story, and leave you feeling 'cold' before it explodes back.\n\nIf there's one song that I'd have to say isn't quite on par with the rest, though, it'd be \"Man of Shadows.\" It's not even that I dislike \"Man of Shadows,\" but I definitely feel that its a bit more of a filler track when the rest of the record is filled with hard hitters. The riff is on the weaker side, and I think the verse melodies are pretty lacking and uninspired. They don't let you get into a good enough groove before they're interrupted by something, and they're not strong enough on their own either. The chorus comes pretty late in the song, and its so random to me. It doesn't really work with what came before it, but it also isn't different enough from the earlier parts of the song to make it a surprise, either. It really just plods along and overstays its welcome. The song isn't all bad, though. I love the random break in the song where Robert Lowe gets a cool little melody along with an acoustic guitar part and some lightly atmospheric keyboards. The part is just too short, and never returns, which kind of leaves you scratching your head.\n\n\"King of the Grey Islands\" is without a doubt one of the best releases Candlemass has ever had, and is the PERFECT way to stick a middle finger up to the Messiah purists who didn't think they'd be able to turn out a good release after he left a second time. It's a rare example of a doom metal album that lets the doom show through its tone and theming as much as the actual music behind it. The album is almost more 'personal' than most of the band's purely fantasy based efforts, and the raw biting nature of that comes through clearly. It's a rare and unique beast that fires from all cylinders. I think both fans and the band alike breathed a sigh of relief when \"King of the Grey Islands\" showed that Candlemass was here to stay for a while.\n",
        "\nAfter Candlemass did an abysmal job at trying to change their style during their previous era, they took a much needed break. Half a decade later, everyone from their famous and classic era would return with another offering. Their self-titled 8th release had a ton of expectations for the simple fact that loved vocalist Messiah Marcolin was returning to complete the Nightfall-era band. There's a good chance that this album would have been praised no matter what the quality of it was like because of the return of a classic lineup, but luckily, the band gave us a great release despite this. More than anything, I think the Candlemass' toughest job was presenting a more modernized version of their tried and true brand of doom. They had to make an album that would keep classic fans happy, but at the same time, if they just tried to ride the coattails of their earlier success, it certainly wouldn't have gone well.\n\nThe closing track \"The Day and the Night\" might be the finest example of the band blending classic with new. The track begins with a somber riff that you could easily imagine coming from their early material. Messiah's vocals soar in, and this begins the shift. While his vocals are still very impressive and operatic on this track, he isn't trying to be as dramatic or theatrical as he used to be. He uses a slightly lower register a lot more and shifts between the two ranges very fittingly all across the record. The song then explodes into a heavy, simple, but effective riff for Messiah to tell his story over. The way the chorus riff and Messiah match notes make the entire passage extremely memorable. The solo followed by the tempo change in the middle perfectly demonstrate what Candlemass is all about.\n\n\"Born in a Tank\" also illustrates how well they've learned their new style. The main riff of the song is a pounding and driving experience, and the tempo and aggression coming from it aren't usually things people would have associated with Candlemass before. Jan's use of double bass, while certainly not unheard of in earlier eras, matches what this song needed. By far my favorite part of the whole song is the riff right before the solo. It's a perfect Candlemass riff that fuels that explosive nature with subtle sadness. Jan's crashes syncing up with the guitar parts help give the notes more attention and focus, too. Nothing shows that Candlemass has learned from the past while keeping what they're loved for more than \"Born in a Tank.\"\n\nAt the same time, there are still plenty of songs on the record that harken back to the classic material more heavily than others. My personal favorite song on this album \"Seven Silver Keys\" is the pure riff-laden doom that I love Candlemass for. The song begins an amazingly dark riff that is even stronger than some of the classics. Messiah effectively uses his lower range during the verses to make the riff feel even more ominous than it would have felt if he tried to soar over it. The chorus riff is dripping with a forlorn beauty that Messiah helps elevate by now showcasing his higher register. It helps \"Seven Silver Keys\" ebb and flow perfectly. It's a wonderful ride of doom. \"Witches\" also has more of a classic feel than a lot of the other songs on this record. The opening riff is also haunting, and feels like it's prepping the listener for a horror story. The song keeps kicking back and forth between that opening riff and the main verse riff for Messiah to sing over, and these transitions keep a tense and suspenseful atmosphere the entire way through. Once again, Messiah could have muddied the atmosphere of the track if he tried to soar over it, but he keeps a lower range to let the creepy and ominous nature shine through more. It really shows how he matured as a vocalist. Interesting aside! Tony Martin of Black Sabbath gave this song a shot in a demo, and even performed it with the band live! Go out of your way to hunt it down if you enjoy \"Witches.\" It's pretty different than the final release with Messiah, but it's SO cool to me to hear Tony Martin playing with Candlemass. He proves he still has it with a really powerful voice on the demo.\n\nThe band's self-titled release sadly isn't without a few missteps, though. The opener, \"Black Dwarf,\" was a song that the band tried to showcase their new style with, but just isn't effective. The song's main riff is really, really boring. It just chugs and bounces without a real purpose or message to send. Messiah, too, is very ineffective on the track. For the verse melodies, he sings a certain melody, and then for the final line of the passage, he tries to push out with more intensity, but it sounds so forced that he completely misses the mark. The chorus is also an incredibly forgettable one. The solo might be the best on the album, however. \"Assassin of the Light\" is the other song on this release that I feel really misses the mark. The opening riff sounds like a rejected one from \"Ancient Dreams,\" and the verse melodies from Messiah are just too annoying for me. The verse melody sounds like he's trying to sneak or groove around the riff instead of complimenting it. It feels very disconnected. The chorus riff is as basic as doom riffs get, and Messiah sounds like he was trying to sound pained during it, but once again just comes off as forcing it.\n\nLuckily for us all, Candlemass returned from their slumber as an absolute ball of fire. While I don't think their self-titled album is quite as strong as some of the classic Marcolin material, it certainly isn't bad by any means, and is a welcomed addition to their discography. Now, for Candlemass fans who think Messiah is the end all be all for the band, this might be where the chapter ends, as egos got in the way once more and couldn't keep Messiah around too long after this release. However, Candlemass struck gold, because they'd go on to pluck another legendary doom metal singer for their next few releases. The Robert Lowe-era begins where this one ended, and he goes on to do possibly the best overall job of any Candlemass singer.\n",
        "\n\"From the 13th Sun\" picks up almost immediately where \"Dactylis\" left off, with the only change in lineup being Michael Amott leaving and being replaced by Mats Stahl. In fact, the band essentially doubles down on what they started for this release. For sure, Candlemass seems more focused on what they were doing for \"13th Sun\" than they were for \"Dactylis.\" The result of that is an album that seems less random. However, unfortunately for them, the lack of variety and pin-pointing on one style makes this album even less enjoyable than the one that came before, because what they focused on was the worst aspects of the one that came before it. When you abandon what you're good at doing, even if you focus all of your efforts on something else, it won't lead to much if you're not exactly good at what it is you're focusing on.\n\nTo get the ball rolling on what you should expect when you listen to this album, just look at the track titles. Candlemass tries to name their songs after a plethora of techno babble as if to prep you for how 'out of this world' this album is. Looking at the track listing seems more like reading the script of a sci-fi B movie rather than a metal album. It really is something of an accomplishment for them to have tried so hard to make a memorable album with experimental music and sci-fi track names, yet it remains the most unmemorable and unremarkable album of their discography. The music on this record is as boring and half-assed as the album cover for it is. Bjorn Flodkvist has abandoned the gruff style of vocals he mixed in on \"Dactylis,\" and now sings almost the entire album in his nasally whiny tone. This is probably the biggest kiss of death for the album. I do not understand why. On the last album, he showed that he was a pretty versatile singer, yet on this one, he almost seems to intentionally be a one trick pony. But the one trick he's doing is the worst trick he knows. \n\nOn \"Arx/NG 891,\" the song's core riff gives it a pretty decent pounding feel until he whines and cries like a child over the top of it. If that wasn't enough, the track goes on for 6 minutes, and really doesn't have the material to justify it. This track feels like the band scrapped together an unfinished song. Like they had one okay idea and just tried to mold things around it to lengthen it instead of sticking it back in the oven to grow more. \"Cyclo F\" might even be worse than that. Without a doubt, this song is where Bjorn's vocals are their absolute worst. He sounds absolutely tone deaf. I'm amazed he was allowed to leave the studio after that kind of performance. Shortly into the song, a random drum solo gets thrown at you, which only leaves me scratching my head. It is a very standard, by the book rock drum solo. It's not like an atmospheric percussion section that's supposed to set a tone or pace. Its just...your basic drum solo randomly smashed in there 3 minutes into the song before the core track comes back just as randomly as it left, only to just loop one part for the remaining 5 minutes. There is nothing tasty or artistically done about \"Cyclo F.\" It is as random and nonsensical as it gets.\n\n\"Blumma Apt\" is probably the biggest heart-breaker on the record. The song's intro gets your hopes up. The intro riff has a somber, chilling mood that really seems like its setting the table for something good. And then it takes a back seat for Bjorn's whining. The track then just crawls across the floor, searching desperately for a place to go to no avail. A little after the halfway point, there's a decent little tempo change that gets the blood pumping a bit, but the little shift is too fleeting for to sink your teeth into before you're back to square one, and left entirely disappointed. \"Tot\" is just about as boring as a song can ever be, too. After some atmospheric raining, we get met by some marching drums and a riff that sounds like it was recycled off \"Dactylis.\" Much like \"Apathy\" on that album, this one features your very stereotypical vocal distortions to feel spacey. The song 'picks up' with an insanely stock riff that an amateur could come up with in high school before you rinse and repeat the dull nonsense. This song has the quality of that local opener you've seen at your favorite dive. Not Candlemass.\n\nThe opener \"Droid\" is the only thing that even remotely saves this record. This song is the reason this album is getting the rating it is and not lower. The main riff of the track is quite powerful and aggressive, and the main drum beat really drives the song and carries it. The snare pattern really makes \"Droid\" move by giving the listener a simple but effective pattern to count on and follow along with. Best of all, they didn't try to turn this song into some lengthy masterpiece. It tells the musical story it needs to tell with some enjoyable playing and then fades away. \"Droid\" is the only song across this entire record that I feel like a modest amount of effort went into crafting. Everything else seems like an experimental jam. Is it a highlight of Candlemass' discography? No. But when you only get one good track on an entire album, you can't help but heap praise on it.\n\n\"From the 13th Sun\" winds up being the very definition of an album that needed more time in the oven. Every single track on this album has a scattered riff or idea here or there that shows some promise, but ends up being bloated or muddied. For every semi decent idea on this album, there's five more that are bland and uninspired to cover it up. If Leif had planned on really going full on in this direction, he needed a lot more time to craft and hone in on the good qualities of the record to build it more. Luckily for me, this era of Candlemass went to sleep as quickly as it had appeared, and when it woke up again, things would be back to normal.\n",
        "\nAfter Candlemass released the underrated gem \"Chapter VI,\" things kind of fell apart. I can only assume after that album didn't receive the praise the Messiah-era albums did, they decided it wasn't worth trying to pick up the pieces anymore and called it quits. Everyone did their own thing for a while, and Leif Edling came up with Abstrakt Algebra. However, upon wanting to create a second Abstrakt Algebra album, it was asked for him to rework it into a new Candlemass release. \"Dactylis Glomerata\" is the result of all of that. The first album with the Candlemass name in half a decade brings a VERY different style than anything traditional fans might be used to. But different doesn't mean bad by default, does it? Well, no. But this one still isn't great.\n\nLeif is armed with an entirely new band than all previous albums. Michael Amott, who had already formed Arch Enemy when he recorded this album but had not seen it hit its peak yet makes an interesting addition. Vocalist Bjorn Flodkvist's very different voice helps cement the bands new identity, and Jejo Perkovic rounds out the group on drums. Carl Westholm plays a big part with his keys on this album, and he must have struck a tight bond with Leif with this one, because he'd perform keyboards for a TON of his releases in various bands after this album.\n\"Dactylis\" is incredibly 'of its time,' and I personally don't think has aged well at all unless you're pretty specifically into the niche this album presents. Most of what you'll find on this record is very distorted, grainy, experimental tracks. Many songs have a lot of space where instrumentally everything just...floats around. The structure and songwriting is more random and disjointed which fails to give it any sort of real identity. Lots of metal in the mid to late 90's was doing this sort of thing. For the most part, \"Dactylis\" is really lacking in the bone-shattering riffs that Candlemass thrives on.\n\n\"Dustflow\" and \"Apathy\" absolutely demonstrate this the hardest. \"Apathy\" greets us with a stellar bassline, like is usual for Leif, and some interesting percussion. However, the guitars are just holding strings one-note long and just distort it to the max besides the solo. It honestly makes me feel like there's an insect of some kind that's near my ear. The vocals have that dripping kind of distortion that makes the singer sound like he's in water. If you're well versed in metal, you've heard a million bands make a song just like \"Apathy\" when they went through their 90's 'experimental' phase. \"Dustflow\" is the same sort of material, but gives the whole band a bit more of a chance to shine. Once again, you have a very cool bass part that feels like a waltz over the rest of the track. The keys do the best they can to give you a 'floating in space' aura, and the guitar parts are solid enough. There's an okay track somewhere hidden in this song, but the bloated 9-minute runtime combined with the fact that it needed something like a tempo change or a new riff somewhere in there to spice it up makes the song just plod along.\n\nWhile those two songs are the ones I'd consider the most mediocre on the album, \"Karthago\" is the highlight. The song kicks off with a heavy, pounding riff that is far more akin to what Candlemass has made their legacy on. This track is what the whole album should have been like to me. It's without a doubt very different than their previous releases, but just the riff alone gives enough of a connection to their previous material to let you know what you love is still hovering inside. The keys go on to harmonize with the chorus riff to give a chilly, haunting-type feel, and Bjorn's vocals are filled with torment and pain to complete the sell. The middle of the track features a lot of what I talked about in the previous two songs, but here, it's done right. All of the atmospheric material is there just long enough to get the mood across, but doesn't overstay its welcome. While \"Karthago\" reigns supreme on this one, album opener \"Wiz\" sets an incredible pace. It writes a check I wish the rest of the album justified cashing. In this instance, the quicker tempo makes the grainy guitar sound biting. \"Wiz\" is a great head-banger, and the aggression it hammers into you makes it one to go back to very often. Bjorn's almost 'grungy,' rougher style of vocals are a perfect fit with the full-speed-ahead nature of \"Wiz.\" All in all, this tracks really clicks and showcases the best of what this lineup was capable of.\n\nOn the other side of that coin, \"Abstrakt Sun\" is where the album truly showcases all of its flaws prominently. To call the vocal melodies weak would be an understatement. They're bored sounding and don't really even try to have any semblance of a pleasing quality to them. The guitar work is beyond awful, with this whining, high pitched squeal that goes absolutely nowhere and just pierces the ears. The entire drum beat is just smashing the crash cymbals over and over and over again. The song seems like unstructured noise and disjointed patterns where no one is trying to compliment or work with each other. It's like if you put all of the instruments in a washing machine and let it run. Everyone is doing their own thing with no mesh or flow. You can definitely refer to this track as an 'experimental' one, but it just makes me cringe for the entire runtime.\n\n\"Dactylis\" was without question supposed to be the start of a new identity for Candlemass. I have no doubt this album was the one that was meant to 'modernize' the band and get them 'with the times.' Little did they realize, though, that everything they attempted on this album had already been attempted and done better by many other artists by the time this was made. They wanted to get a new identity with this album, but at the end of the day, released a record without any identity at all. Even though Candlemass is now (at time of writing) back to their roots, they'd still have one more attempt in them to right the ship and maintain the course for their new identity that this album started.\n",
        "\nI've already written a review for Nightfall, one of my favorite albums of any genre ever. This record definitely has the same status. Eventually after I finish writing 100 reviews and have my 15 perfect albums complete, this and NIghtfall will appear back to back. Candlemass were ready for metal and metal was barely ready for them, they changed the landscape of metal not only in Sweden, but worldwide. Nobody had ever sounded like them before, this in 1986 Candlemass crafted the new and aptly named genre of \"epic doom metal\" a genre influenced by classical and opera and fused with the crushing riffs, drumming, and slowness of Black Sabbath, Pentagram, Saint Vitus, etc. They were truly original, and they garnered attention amongst thrash fans as well, in 1986 thrash was king and they still managed to appeal to the people of that scene, even with the stark differences in genres. This and Bathory's debut were truly the crowning achievements of early Swedish metal. Let's get into this masterpiece's glory.\n\nEpicus begins with a track that's instantly recognizable and a genre classic, perhaps being the bands most recognizable tune, Solitude. This is the classic intro to the all new genre, the song having the lyrics and attitude of doom, but making a sound of epicness and a never before heard sound that can only be described as ancient. Demons Gate has synths and a spoken word intro that sounds like a demon speaking, and a crushing bass/drums only midsection. Crystal Ball, Black Stone Wielder, Under The Oak, A Sorcerer's Pledge, these are all the definition of epic doom metal, every song sounds like something that would've been written if metal had existed in the 1700's, ancient, foreboding and ultimately epic. The vocals of Johan are incredible, the emotion he conveys in every lyric can be felt, and it's a shame this guy was a poser at the time and didn't want to be in the band. The solos are also incredibly well-done, and they're unforgettable. The production of this record is another strong suit and the specific way this was produced helped establish the epic doom metal production format.\n\nThis production is heavy, thick, and to say it has reverb is an understatement. This album's production definitely helps establish its atmosphere, and that's why I love it. I like this album's production better than Nightfall's or Ancient Dreams'. I love being able to hear Leif's bass, and not only that, the tone of the guitar is perfect, the drums sound great and powerful and aren't overdone or underdone, they're just right where they need to be in the mix and they sound fantastic. The reverb of the drums makes this release so much heavier and atmospheric and is one of the selling points of this fantastic release. \n\nSo all in all, this is one of my favorite albums ever, this is the only band in my top 15 albums of all time to have two LP's on the list, and deservedly so This album, while only 3/5ths of the band are official members, is one of the best albums of all time and deserves all the praise it gets. When you get the chance, definitely give this album a spin, it's one of the best ever. 100%\n\n-Nolan\n",
        "\nImagine hearing the first two Candlemass albums in the 80's. The masterful craft of epic doom they invented in 86 with their debut was unlike anything ever done musically, sure they had plenty of influences, but they took those influences and crafted an entirely different beast, as most Swedish metal bands do. Candlemass is special in the way that along with Bathory they helped influence the youth of Sweden to form bands and play at local youth centers, start fanzines, start bands, release demos, and eventually Sweden became the best country for metal and put out some of the most classic bands/albums of all time. Today I'm delving into the fantastic and highly anticipated follow up to 1987's \"Nightfall\" this is Candlemass's third effort, Ancient Dreams from 1988. Let's get into the music within, shall we?\n\nThe album starts out with the heavy hitting \"Mirror, Mirror\" one of their best songs and one of the best on the album. A key difference here is that there aren't any interludes/preludes like the previous record. This keeps us from having to wait, and because of this you'll soon hear the memorable riff of \"A Cry From The Crypt\" a melodic grooving 7:24 song with 2 fantastic solos (one being the outro) and a marvelous vocal performance by Messiah. These first two tracks introduce fans to a different production, which I'll cover later on. \"Darkness in Paradise\" is simply fantastic, one of the best tunes on the record, the bass and vocals at the forefront creating quite the song. \"Incarnation of Evil\" starts with a distorted voice intro talking about something evil. Of course Messiah slays here as well as the band, with memorable lyrics and riffs to boot. That's 4/8th of the album covered. with the last four tracks being all fantastic in their own right, but for the sake of the reader, I will only mention the 2 standouts of them, not going into detail, but I definitely don't dislike these tracks. \"Bearer of Pain\" and the title track rule. I love these songs, only 3 points away from \"Nightfall\" just because that album has more classic songs and is just a bit better. Now onto the production of the record.\n\nThe production on this album is just a bit cleaner than \"Nightfall\" the drums are just as punchy, but there isn't as much reverb, but it's still there. If i'm not mistaken there was an issue with the snare on \"Nightfall\", and as a result the drums sound different. I love the drums on \"Nightfall\" but the drums sound better and I stand by saying they are better on this follow up release. The guitars sound a bit less cavernous and a bit less \"fuzzy\" than the previous release, but I don't have an issue, as it does not stray away from the Candlemass signature sound and it doesn't compromise the riffs either. This album also has more audible bass, which adds proper backbone to the music, which was present on NIghtfall, but is done ten times better here. All in all, this album has better production and it serves it well.\n\nAll in all this album gets a 97 from me, I love this album, it's one of Candlemass's finest releases. It has all of the aspects of the band that make them the masters of doom metal and the masters of epic doom. It gets a 97 because of some very memorable tracks, just a little less memorable than \"Nightfall\" this album was originally a 95, but as a result of the cleaned up production it gained two points, and well deserved, because the production makes this record a more enjoyable listen when the riffs have more clarity as well as the drums and bass. If you like the first two records from Candlemass, I'll bet that you'll thoroughly enjoy this record. Listen to it after \"Nightfall\" and compare the sounds and the album style, while \"Nightfall\" has many interludes/preludes, Ancient Dreams have none to be found. Great record!\n\n-Nolan\n",
        "\n\"Only the vultures will come to see me hang...\"\n\nCandlemass, the masters of epic doom and even doom itself released \"Epicus...\" in 1986 creating a new style of doom metal and showing the world another Swedish metal master, along with Bathory. That album has such an ancient, foreboding and expectedly epic feel to it and that is further developed on Nightfall. Nightfall is an album that never ceases to put chills on my back with the epic atmosphere that it creates. The lyrics, production, tempos, and the 19 year old Messiah's masterful vocals, who was full time singer after they used Johan L\u00e4ngquist as a session guest on the first album. (He did fantastic, but wished to pursue a solo career, but joined Candlemass in 2018) This album is one of my top 10 albums of all time, and today i'm delving into the majesty of Candlemass's magically crafted epic doom metal masterpiece, their sophomore release, Nightfall\n\nThe album prepares you for the epic atmosphere, with 48 second Gothic Stone, with opera singers, drums and a haunting melody to boot, which follows The Well of Souls with an awesome vocal intro by Messiah, introducing him to listeners. This song's riff is very catchy. There are a lot of instrumental preludes on this album, something that usually pisses me off, (There are 4 in total) but they are here for a good reason here, but i'm going to avoid talking about them because most of them are riffs of the song that follows repeated, or are a part of the chord progression of the following song, except for Codex Gigas. Codex Gigas is followed by two super strong tracks, At Gallows End is simply one of the best songs ever recorded, with it's dark and melodic intro of a man narrating the beginning of his last day, it begins with a beautiful sunrise, the last time the light will embrace his face in that manner, that beauty and light, so warm and tender. He has been hypnotized and was not able to sleep, and is dwelling on his last day, his last hours. He knows he's condemned to Hell, he has lived his life as a sinner, now being punished for it, but he has a friend where he's going, the devil. The main riff and speedier portion of this song along with solo are perfection disguised as music. The next song is the opposite of the spectrum, which is what I love about these two tracks. The next song is Samarithan, which is about a man who gives a beggar food, clothes and a bed and goes to heaven for his deeds. The song has a fantastic riff and Messiah is wonderful in his delivery on this song in particular. Then the last 3 songs, one of them having a music video that is hilarious, Dark Are The Veils of Death, Mourners Lament and Bewitched. Both Dark... and Mourners... are classic songs with awesome riffs and vocal performances. Did I mention the solos and drums? They are wonderful on this record. Mourners Lament has chiming bells and an amazing vocal intro as well. The highlight of the album, the song that everyone thinks of either first or second when Candlemass is mentioned, the almighty Bewitched. The riff, unforgettable, the lyrics legendary, the music video? Hilarious... and amazing at the same time. No one can forget that line, \"You are Bewitched!\" The solo on this song is the best one on the entire record as well. This album is really only 6 songs due to the preludes/instrumentals, and every song is a masterpiece. Now about the production.\n\nThe production here is reverb laden, and this adds so much to the atmosphere and the epic feeling of the album, the drums are punchy and cavernous complimenting the riffs amazingly, the bass is also very well done adding awesome backbone to the riffs and drums. The distortion of the guitars is some of the best i've ever heard, that tone is amazing and I love it. Messiah's vocals were recorded awesomely as well, definitely one of the best vocal performances I have ever heard. There are also some keyboards and acoustic parts recorded, and they add to the atmosphere very well.\n\nThis is an example of a band who didn't know what a sophomore slump was, and proved that they are the masters of doom metal. Candlemass had already impressed with their masterful debut album, which I love, but not as much as this album. Candlemass and Bathory were the first extreme metal bands to get attention from Sweden, helping get the underground movement picking up where D-beat bands left off in the early 80's. Some of those demo tapes were the fastest recordings of that time. Candlemass wasn't fast by any means, but they were still very influential. Other than influencing later Swedeath metal boom of 1988-1993, they influenced epic doom bands worldwide, for example, Solitude Aeturnus, Solstice, Sorcerer, and the criminally underrated Scald, an epic doom metal band from Russia that have one album every Candlemass fan must hear, The WIll of Gods is Great Power.\n\nAll in all this album is a 100, it's the first album i've reviewed that isn't death metal besides 1 Bethlehem record. Doom metal is one of my favorite genres, and this is the album that got me into it. I can't tell you how many non metalheads i've shown this to, who adore it and have seen the Bewitched video. This is definitely the album to recommend to all new-comers of the doom metal genre. Listen to it today\n\n-Nolan\n",
        "\nWhere do you think you are when you step through \"The Door to Doom\"? Probably in the \"House of Doom\". Exciting? No, somehow logical, predictable and a little bit boring... And so it goes on. Who lives in the \"House of Doom\"? Surprise, Leif Edling. He has made himself comfortable and is reluctant to leave his fluffy couch. There he sits now and writes his riff-emphasised melodies, which still sound pretty much the same as they did 35 years ago, when Candlemass released their debut in 1986. Actually, they even sound something like the style-forming harmonies that were presented by Mr. Iommi on 13.02.1970. But the other 16 years don't matter now either.\n\nYou might have noticed it when you read the first paragraph. \"The Door to Doom\" is not an album that sends me into absolute euphoria. Candlemass offer more of the same. They do it in a mature, dignified and anything but bad way, yet Edling could have at least thought for a moment about some kind of exceptional characteristics. Or (totally revolutionary) just let someone else write a song. Some of the melodies sound damn familiar, but that's probably his personal touch. Speaking of personal touches, the new singer called Johan L\u00e4ngquist doesn't add any. He has a very similar approach to Robert Lowe, so he is not a bad vocal acrobat, but he hits the notes safely, powerfully and clearly. He even creates a certain drama and tension, but sorry, we know all that already. I would have rather wished for Messiah or Thomas Vikstr\u00f6m back.\n\nOf course, of course, I can reassure you all, dear readers of this review. \"The Door to Doom\" is not a dunghill. This is not only due to the full, albeit somewhat polished sound of the album. There are no total failures on the song list. Even the soft \u201cBridge of the Blind\u201d is not an annoyance. Thanks to the usual but fortunately not rancid mixture of intensity and indulgence, the material gets into the ear well, but often out again quickly. \"Under the Ocean\" and other tracks have really some strong sequences to offer, but a real highlight is missing. There is no new \"Dark Reflections\", \"Assassin of the Light\" or \"Of Stars and Smoke\" (and even if you have other favourite songs, their class is also touched upon here at best). Maybe the story of Candlemass has simply been told. What remains is a nice, unspectacular, foreseeable and somewhat poppy doom record, without which the world would not be significantly poorer.\n\nWhat do I see? Colleague Edling is enraged. He makes an effort to get up from the couch and vigorously object. In a moment he will have risen... but no, too strenuous. He prefers to stay in the comfort zone. The couch is just too warm and cosy.\n",
        "\nFew albums are actually as essential to a genre as they implicitly claim. Most seminal records help push the boundaries of their time and reveal uncharted territory for the next generation to take heed and further develop the style until an entirely new genre is created. On Candlemass' 1986 debut album here, the band not only permanently establish a definitional trademark doom metal sound (others responsible for it as well), as they also release one of the most accomplished works in the genre's history. Not that they single-handedly invented the genre, but let's just leave it at this: the album deserves its title 'Epicus...', and rather than being a smug appellation it rather feels tongue-in-cheek in spirit as well as aptly descriptive. Instead of coming across as a merely brave effort full of youthful exuberance and rookie mistakes this debut album sounds like the ripe work of seasoned veterans that have perfected the song-writing down to the smaller details. \n\nThe songs are all eminently climactic. They're given judiciously crafted intros, the verses aren't just tossed in but rather seamlessly embedded into the tracks with clever and detailed sections around them making for a perfectly fluid listening experience, and the choruses are enchanting moments of unforgettable pure doom metal grief. The songs know when to mix it up in tone and color, thus avoiding the droning staleness usually associated with the style, as the bulk of the tracks will be heavy with the imposing dirges before soon switching to either an eerie low/high lead harmony interlude often punctuated by the soaring solos, an acoustic guitar part more rustic in feel, or a short bass solo break linking up the two halves of a song.\n\nThe riffs have a luster about them and genuinely make the album feel essential and classic, almost gleaming with the aura of an old recording from previous decades that was discovered some time in the 80's. If not for the verse/chorus structure, conferring a modern format and feel to the songs, this could practically come across at least in atmosphere as session music for mysterious secret society rituals, as it's got that quaint quasi-religious reverence about it. A major component of that epic ambiance in the riffs comes from the octave doubling whether on guitars or synth choir hums, and with the added reverb at the back of the mix the guitars sound distinctly alive, like they're breathing entities pouring out their chagrin. Then-vocalist Johan L\u00e4ngquist has quite a bit to do with the solemn and sober tone of the record. His style surely is not as impressive as the next lead vocalist Messiah Marcolin and his operatic demonstrations, but it rather serves the album as it fits the straightforward and reserved feel of the record.\n\nMuch of the charm comes from the plainness in composition that each track conveys, and rather than expand the songs in length and extra parts Candlemass opt to thicken or modify the sections either harmonically or with drum variations among other arrangements. They do a remarkable job at keeping the entire album at virtually the same tempo, and yet never have it sound stale or flat. A temptation among many doom acts is throwing in a slightly faster section just to add a dynamic to the pacing before returning to the ponderous stuff, but Candlemass are doom metal purists here and they have their own methods of writing classic cult doom for the ages.\n\nAnnable Courts - http://antichristmagazine.com/review-candlemass-epicus-doomicus-metallicus-black-dragon-records/\n",
        "\nA self-titled album can mean many things. Most commonly it's the first album released by a band - the statement is \"This is who we are, this is our band, and this is the art we want to make.\" So for Candlemass to release theirs 20 years into their career with a cover void of anything but their logo, and to do so after a long spell of questionable releases which left many thinking the band had lost their identity - it's bold to say the least. But as a single listen to the album proves, that confidence was more than justified, and this re-emergence from slumber would see a revitalised Candlemass firing on all cylinders, determined to reclaim their place at the top of the epic doom world.\u00a0\n\nThe Swedes in effect present us with a more focused, stripped-back version of their distinct sound. The focal point has clearly shifted; the mystical melodies and soaring vocal lines from albums like Nightfall are still there in some capacity, but they've taken a backseat to the crushingly heavy riffing. Mappe Bj\u00f6rkman's rhythm guitarwork is more potent than ever, giving rise to monolithic, overwhelming soundscapes, illustrated especially well in the instrumental interlude - as weird as it feels to be saying this about Candlemass of all bands and not some obscure Finnish funeral doom act, The Man Who Fell From the Sky is actually in contention for the heaviest song I've ever heard. With all that being said though, Johansson's leads have their role to play as well - his prints are heard all over the album in the form of sudden bursts of solo that come in to ease the tension.\n\nSpeaking of focus shifts, you can also say goodbye to the immersive high-fantasy lyrics of albums like Tales of Creation - Candlemass' self-titled is a gritty, down-to-earth affair, the only retained theme from albums past being the Christianity denoted by the cover. Lyrically, it deals with the clash between the whimsical stories we tell and our cold, harsh reality and the contrast is very well-expressed through the vocals. Candlemass have seen a lot of different people take up the mantle as their singer over the years, but Messiah Marcolin towers above all the rest. His voice here rivals his performance on Nightfall in sheer power, delivering some of the most memorable lines in all of doom metal on songs like Copernicus (\"The sky is full of shining crosses for our sins...\") and Witches (\"You know it's time to scream now and leave this fucking place\").\n\nThere is a complaint or two I can level against the album, however. First off, the band play it way too safe in terms of song structures and composition. Practically every single song is born from a blueprint of \"riff-verse-chorus-solo-verse-chorus\", which doesn't mar the quality of the album, but it does give that nagging sense of wasted potential. I would've loved to hear a Well of Souls-esque bridge to slow things down and amplify the 'epic' in epic doom, but only Copernicus, the album's best song, comes close to achieving that effect.\n\nMy other complaint is that while most songs on here boast undeniable quality and passion, there's two which are below standard. 'Born in a Tank' tries to be a more aggressive, gritty piece akin to the opener 'Black Dwarf', but it doesn't tread any new territory and ends up coming off as a lacklustre attempt to recapture the feeling. The other miss is 'The Day and the Night', which tries to be an epic closer but ends up overlong, repetitive and drawn-out, robbing the album of a lot of momentum at the very end. Had they cut out the filler and given us something a little more potent and concise, this would be the perfect Candlemass album. But even if not flawless, it's still incredible as it stands.\n\nTo conclude, Candlemass found their footing in a very different place to the ancient, grandiose landscapes of times past. Their self-titled album has the band's signature romantic, fantastical flair in places but overall is a much more gritty, down-to-earth affair. It was a new, bold direction to take but quality is nonetheless written all over the result, and my minor complaints do not change that.\n\nHighlights: Copernicus, Witches, The Man Who Fell From the Sky, Seven Silver Keys\n",
        "\nThe black sheep of the Candlemass family this one? Absolutely. However, before you start vilifying and slaughtering it, let\u2019s take a closer look at the circumstances surrounding this lamb\u2026 and if we do that, we\u2019ll find out that it simply doesn\u2019t belong to this family. The foster fathers were blackmailed into adopting it\u2026 yeah, tragedies of soap saga-sque proportions are not exactly strangers to the metal circuit, ladies and gentlemen. They\u2019re a not very common phenomenon but do pop up from time to time\u2026 to add spice to a heavy shredding routine, mind you; not much else. \n\nCause once upon a time Candlemas was a happy family, happily married (1984) and happily divorced (1994), a wedlock that lasted for a good part of ten years; one that tolerated a few wild cards (Messiah Marcolin) along the way, but one that solidly thrived under the watchful gaze of Leif Edling, the father figure, the man who kept the Candlemass saga marching onward to success, fortune, glory\u2026 success again\u2026\n\nhowever, once the tides changed, the man didn\u2019t find it necessary anymore to keep the family members together. The times had become ripe for something more abstract and more mathematical, and here\u2019s how Abstrakt Algebra appeared, Candlemass\u2019 more volatile less doom-prone sibling, one that also saw Edling adding a gifted new member to the family, the axeman Mike Wead (Hexenhaus/Memento Mori, King Diamond/Mercyful Fate later). The father generously ignored the fact that said Mike had previously teamed up with the denounced son Marcolin for the Memento Mori stint, but a shredder of such a calibre should be forgiven such shortcomings\u2026 after all, Edling was looking for a suitable associate to head the newly-sprung power/progressive/doom metal wave in his homeland, a strong statement of that last intent being the Abstrakt Algebra debut. \n\nA promising new enterprise? Sure thing, with only one small detail missing: Edling had to receive the blessing of the other chiefs of the Swedish metal mafia; without their signatures this endeavour would remain just an isolated spell, buried in the annals of the Swedish underworld. During the fateful meeting in early spring in 1998, the man didn\u2019t get green light for this project; the godfathers couldn\u2019t see why Edling would be looking to branch out into other ventures instead of prolonging the existence of its main child, the one and only Candlemass; the scene simply looked barren without the presence of the kings of doom\u2026 they had to be brought back but not side-lined by some capricious algebraic foci. A confrontation was looming on the horizon, which prompted Mike to pack his guitar and abandon the Abstrakt camp; he wanted no trouble with the powers of the day whom he almost instantly pleased with two albums, one from the Hexenhaus (\u201cDejavoodoo\u201d) and one from the Memento Mori (\u201cSongs for the Apocalypse Vol. IV\u201d) camp, both pretty good, faithful to the mentioned wave.\n\nA very sad development for Edling who was left betrayed and desperate, with more than half an album completed, waiting to be released under the Abstrakt Algebra moniker. As this initiative wasn\u2019t an option anymore, the man found it beyond futile to go to war as a lone wolf, he had no choice but to shoot as Candlemass again\u2026 only that he would use the already composed material; he would add a few more tunes and doom\u2026 sorry, boom, he would satisfy a wide gamut of humans, not to mention the always-devoted Candlemass audience. For the purpose, he decided to team up with another Mike, Ammott, another talented guitarist who had gathered a fair bit of notoriety earlier, largely for stirring an early-90\u2019s Carnage on the Swedish scene and promptly fleeing to England right after, in order to escape the inevitable death sentence. However, his biggest crime was that he left his motherland for the Isles only to shoot the local favourites Carcass to stardom; an unpardonable sin in some people\u2019s eyes\u2026 a sagacious businessman, the guy exonerated himself by offering two lucrative outfits upon his return from exile, the stoner/doom feelgooders Spiritual Beggars, and the melo-death metal cohort Arch Enemy; and before you know it things were back to normal. \n\nYep, you can\u2019t make a mistake betting on such a prominent, also controversial, figure and this collaboration swiftly became a fact. The cross-carved skeleton, or the skeleton-ornated cross, from the debut was smacked at the right bottom side of the cover, and the two luminaries were ready to go\u2026 the Candlemass saga would receive another go, yeah! \u201cJoy to the world, the kings have come\u2026\u201d; it doesn\u2019t matter that Christmas was still far away, the metal world was celebrating the return of the legends with all Christmas carols re-written and adapted for the occasion. Under the joyous circumstances, any chances for Marcolin to be lured back? Are you kidding?! Take this complete unknown, the name Bj\u00f6rn Flodkvist, and stick him behind the mike\u2026 he should do the trick. \n\nAnd the man does the trick on all counts, holding his own with a steady, not very emotional baritone, perfectly fitting the belligerent rhythms of the opening \u201cWiz\u201d this one not exactly vintage Candlemass but not a bad inauguration at all, with echoes of the guys\u2019 step-sisters (of) Mercy. However, the doom-laden tactics are only a few minutes away and here comes \u201cI Still See the Black\u201d to paint everything in black rolling stones\u2026 sorry, colours and to shatter the foundations of all shacks around. Too tenebrous this antediluvian hymn, and some brightening of the horizon becomes necessary but not by much as the 9.5-min saga \u201cDustblow\u201d is a psychedelic dreamy, but not overly optimistic quasi-doomy melancholia, a seductive hypnotic parade that doesn\u2019t bring too much abstraktism to the already larger-than-life menu. Bigger adherence to the doomy canons would only be beneficial, and yes, this is exactly what \u201cKarthago\u201d delivers, intimidating ship-sinking doom at its finest. You can\u2019t mess with the masters, even the unpromisingly-titled \u201cAbstrakt Sun\u201d steps aside in veneration serving spacey balladic, oblivious doomisms merging with the similarly-styled but more minimalistic \u201cApathy\u201d, before \u201cLidocain God\u201d shows some bite with more energetic rhythms, the band trying to exit this opus in the way they started it, with more verve and passion.\n\nHm\u2026 what the hell has happened here? This by no means sounds like a customary Candlemass album, but it doesn\u2019t bear too many resemblances to the Abstrakt Algebra outing, either; the ambitious progressive power/doom metal layout of the latter is only ephemerally present, mostly as a side-dish which may as well remain untasted. In fact, this approach to song-writing is more abstract, the psychedelic cloud is thicker, the hypnotic therapy is more lasting, and when you add the renewed interest in doom on at least one third of the material, then this recording is more of a new direction taken than a faithful sequel to anything Edling has come up with previously. It\u2019s not hard to detect the mentioned third, it\u2019s clear that \u201cI Still See the Black\u201d and \u201cKarthago\u201d have been written later with the Candlemass repertoire in mind, the other songs coming as one interesting psychedelic progressive doom/rock/metal package that certainly smells something both spiritual and beggary\u2026 \n\nso this second Mike did put his signature under these tunes; it was kind of good that he didn\u2019t stick around for another spell\u2026 nah, nothing too embarrassing, mind you, good music all around only not packaged with the Candlemass fanbase as the prime target. The heavier doomy material was apparently added to daub the eyes of the big bosses who were eagerly waiting to hear how their investments had been spent\u2026 and they must have been left satisfied with it as Edling survived; and not only but he was given more finances for another Candlemass album, one that deepened the doom without completely phasing out the psychedelia, the man coming even closer sound-wise to his idols Black Sabbath. Flodkvist was here again, happy to lend his vocal cords for another spacey transcendental ride\u2026 his last corroboration with Edling as the Candlemass saga came to another end early in the new millennium. \n\nKrux was the name of the new offspring, Edling simply can\u2019t sit still, just looking at life passing him by\u2026 this was an outfit closer to the doom metal idea, and one that miraculously survived even after the Candlemass family got re-married, marriage nearly made in heaven this time, with even Marcolin showing up for the opening ceremony, the self-titled masterpiece. The experimental chapter from the band\u2019s discography seems to have been closed for good, the steam-rolling doom-foreboding machine has been moving onward without fail ever since\u2026 no algebra, no geometry, no half-cooked spells in Latin\u2026 let\u2019s stick with the doom, and leave the mathematics and the obsolete languages for the university students.\n",
        "\nTo say I was a huge Candlemass fan, is to state the obvious. I have been a fan for many years, and it has influenced my playing. I have also had the pleasure of seeing them live twice \u2013 something that was amazing. So when I saw I had the chance to review the latest album from them, even though their last few ones were not ones I would have recommended but were not overly bad either.\n\nI will not get into the long history of the band here, only to say that the latest incarnation (Leif Edling; bass, Mats \"Mappe\" Bj\u00f6rkman: rhythm guitars, Lars Johansson: lead guitars, Jan Lindh: drums, percussion and Mats Lev\u00e9n \u2013 lead vocals) is not one of my favorites. They seem to be trying to keep the bands signature style and the added bonus is this EP which is the soundtrack for a on-line game of the same name (slot machine styled). I will not be commenting on that here, the music is my only true focus.\n\nThrough this is four song outing, I listened carefully. I could feel that the old school vibe of the band was coming back, but still it was not there. Vocalist Mats Leven is more than capable, but I could not help but think that if past vocalist Messiah Marcolin was the at the helm fronting them, this would make it from average to epic. The songs and music are stellar but the vocals seem to drag them down, and sap some of the power from them. As their style reverts back to classic, the songs get more power and this is good for all doom fans, as well as all metal fans. \n\nCandlemass is back, as founder and bassist Leif Edling returns from taking time off due to an illness and has delivered a very good album. In my opinion, with the right vocalist, this could have been so much better than what has been offered up \u2013 yet it is what it is. Still good.\n\n(Originally written for www.metalbite.com)\n",
        "\nFew bands have impacted the metal scene in such way as Candlemass did with this behemoth of an album. 1986 was the year, Sweden was the country and Epicus Doomicus Metallicus was the name of the album that made an enormous crater when it impacted into the 80\u00b4s scene. Trash metal seemed to be the dominating trend in those years, for example, Sodom, Megadeth, Slayer, Kreator, Metallica and so on so forth. Every single trash metal band was hitting the scene with great recordings that focused mainly on noise, speed and aggression. However, Candlemass said \u201chold on guys, let\u00b4s be epic, heavy as fuck and way slower than the rest of those bands\u201d. So, it is time to praise the undoubtable and untouchable classic that influenced thousands of bands yet to come and that also put the brakes on to the speedy and aggressive bands back in those years. \n\nEpicus Doomicus Metallicus captures you with the intrigue of the album title. Then, it casts you on the spell of \u201cSolitude\u201d, the first track in this monstrous corner stone. Solitude is simply the hymn for desperation and depression, it is atmospheric, moody and functions almost as a funeral march. Since the first verse you realize of the overwhelming sadness that engulfs the person who wrote the lyrics. The voice of Johan L\u00e4ngquist fits perfectly with the lyrics, showing a spectral register that transmits the deep forlorn perfectly. The riffs are seriously heavy as fuck, I really mean it, Iommi would be proud of the crushing punishment that Mats \"Mappe\" Bj\u00f6rkman displays. The bass, oh my fucking god, the bass lines are almighty and permeate the musical skeleton with incredible force sponsored by Leif Edling. Hey folks! this is just the first song, the beginning of the ominous path we have yet to walk. \n\nThe album is composed by six pieces of absolute greatness and obscure poetry. Demons gate opens with some cryptic spoken words that set the mood to what\u00b4s to come next. The riffs in this song are more driven by a dark hypnotic melody accompanied by the ghastly vocal performance of L\u00e4ngquist. The bass gallops along the guitars with simple lines but at the same time seemed to be omnipresent and very predominant; providing a thick and chunky aura to the music and overall production. Every single track in Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is transcendental and leaves a profound mark in your musical memory. No fillers at all, all the music is created with the intention to trap the listener in a valley of desolation and loneliness. Crystal Ball appears to have the same slow and crushing atmosphere but by the minute 3:00 speeds just a little bit to show the incredible musicianship of the guys in Candlemass just to come back to the slow pace that will become a trademark in the genre. Let\u00b4s continue the journey through the Acheron, guided by some galloping guitars that help telling the story of the Black Stone Wielder. A song that changes gears between slow-crushing pace and a more galloping dynamics offered by the guitars and drums. Under the Oak and A Sorcerer\u00b4s Pledge close the album in a monumental way, all songs here are instant anthemic classics of doom/epic doom metal. \n\nAs I said at the beginning of the review, Candlemass changed the accelerated pace that most bands where following back in the time to implement a more overwhelming sonic experience and also to change the status quo of the faster the better. They implemented the less is more approach influenced by the down tune guitars of Black Sabbath. Something that caught my attention is the age of the band members when they released Epicus Doomicus Metallicus; they were surprisingly in their early twenties. You expect to listen such a mature effort from musician in their thirties or more but these guys were very young even though the recording sounds incredibly mature and self- centered. \n\nConcluding the revision of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, I have to say that there is no waste of notes, riffs, fills, lines or screams in this recording. Everything is strategically set up to capture your ear and cast you in a spell of subterranean sadness, longing and forlorn. The greatness that we had the opportunity to witness is epic and very few bands have been able to craft such imposing day view album. Changing paradigms of music structures, production and even aesthetics, Candlemass became a reference and influential force for upcoming acts like Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and The Gathering. So, in conclusion, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is a totemic monument where we all must kneel and praise for the impact it had in doom metal. Listen to it, is mandatory if you call yourself a metalhead.\n",
        "\nCandlemass' most famous singer left the band, so that must mean their next release can't be as good, right? Well, if your mind is that closed, you're going to miss out on quite the experience. Candlemass' fifth album, titled \"Chapter VI,\" is absolutely one of their best. Now, to be fair, this album is a little bit less doom-y than anything that came before it. The addition of new singer Thomas Vikstrom adds immediately more of that subtle power metal influence that I alluded to just a touch on \"Tales of Creation.\" Vikstrom is a phenomenal singer, though. In fact, I absolutely think he has more depth and variety in his voice than Messiah. Do I think he would have been a perfect long-term singer that fits their older doom-y songs? No. But he's able to use his voice and cut through a new style on this record. That's also not to say he can't put the doom in his voice either, though.\n\n\"Where the Runes Still Speak\" is a more traditional sounding Candlemass epic on \"Chapter VI.\" For the eerie intro, keyboards, guitar, and bass are all playing the melody, and Vikstrom comes in to give the song the freezing cold feeling they lay the foundation for. You can almost close your eyes and picture yourself standing outside as icy cold rain hits you for this song. The main guitar part is a slow paced bone chiller of a riff, and Vikstrom is shutting up any naysayer with his vocals here. He has the perfect variation in emotion and epic singing on the song. Every powerful high note he adds is done so specifically to enhance exactly what needs to be. His high notes on the chorus are a work of art. And during the final few loops of the chorus at the end, he kicks it up to eleven, and delivers notes that any singer could learn a lesson from. In my opinion, this album is the best collection of Johansson's solos. His solo on this track is a staggeringly good one. \"Where the Runes Still Speak\" is an absolute journey. \"Julie Laughs No More\" is very creative in the way the song's story basically takes fairy tales and flips them on their head. It makes all of these happy nursery rhymes suddenly seem sinister and hopeless. Once again, Vikstrom uses his high notes as an amplifier on the chorus. Those notes are deliberately saved to further bolster the chorus. The main riff of the song is a quick and punchy one, and I find it incredibly unique in the way that both lead and rhythm guitars harmonize the very last few end notes each time. It's a subtly cool sound that I think deserves attention, because it's very easy to gloss over.\n\n\"Temple of the Dead\" has some absolutely supreme riff work. Every single riff that is introduced is incredible. A short keyboard intro sets the tone for the song, and then matches the following riff for a little before the main riff comes in. Once again, the harmonization between both guitars makes the riff feel really special. The riff itself is also just an immediately powerful and catchy one. It's dark and dreary in an almost alarming way. It gives a panicked and frenzied energy to it. The keyboards sporadically return here and there on the track to give the mood a bit of weight, too. After the second chorus, the song's main riff takes a total tonal shift. It suddenly progresses into a more groove based head-banger of a riff. It's another absolutely beautiful part that rivals the ones prior. Johansson gives another stunning solo too, and the little acoustic section that follows it gives a bit of life and breathing room for the song. In general, \"Temple of the Dead\" really does no wrong. The album's opener \"The Dying Illusion\" is a bone-crushing track that kicks both this album and the new lineup off right. The main riff is a bit of a simple one for Candlemass, but it accomplishes its mission of injecting energy into the album for Vikstrom to surge forward on. Vikstrom's vocal melodies on \"The Dying Illusion\" really are what makes the whole song. The subtle keyboard work supports him, and gives him an eerie mood to lay his foundation upon. The chorus riff and vocals combined exude an extremely melancholic mood that shows the roots of the band still there despite the slight direction change on this record. The section that follows the solo does a great job of kicking the energy up again with a different feel than the main riff has. \"The Dying Illusion\" is Candlemass putting a bit more flame into their music instead of the bone chilling cold they normally go for.\n\nWithout a doubt, my favorite track on the record is \"Black Eyes,\" though. The main riff of the song has a stellar groove and punchy energy to it. Vikstrom gives great variance in his performance here. His vocal lines have an impressive mixture of sinister, desperate, and terrified natures that weave a brilliant story. I think the song is very unique due to the story of the song seeming like it could be about a real life woman at first glance, but as the song goes on, it's clear that there is something far more unearthly about the entity. The prechorus riff is a superb one. It really builds up to the chorus in an almost roller coaster-like way before the chorus is the drop. The riff is an insanely catchy one. The chorus itself is Vikstrom putting on another clinic. His vocals are chilled to the bone, and his high notes are gorgeous. After another great solo at the end of the song, it ends rather abruptly, leaving you catching your breath. Conversely to \"Black Eyes,\" \"Aftermath\" is the only song on the album that I dislike. Again, it's certainly not a horrible song, but it's mediocre enough to drag the album down a bit. The chorus is honestly the biggest reason for this, as the song opens with an acoustic intro that is quick enough to not get dull, and also nice enough to be a great burst of new life to the album. The song's main riff is actually a pretty strong one that mixes beauty and doom, and Vikstrom is absolutely as powerful as ever. The verse melodies are just a little bit on the standard side for Candlemass, and then the chorus hits. It's insanely whiny, and just falls flat in every regard after the verses. It doesn't really get built upon, and isn't strong when it makes itself known. It feels like a chorus a hair band would come up with, not Candlemass. The track also ends on a pretty nice fade out to another acoustic part. In general, \"Aftermatch\" isn't a terrible track, but it seems pretty clear to me that this one was an absolute filler track.\n\n\"Chapter VI\" is an incredibly strong record no matter how you look at it. There are few records in all of metal that are such a victim of circumstance as much as this one is. I definitely admit that it's not quite as dark and full-on doom-y as Candlemass prior, so if that's ALL you listen to Candlemass for, I guess this one might be a bit disappointing, but as an album standing on its own, it measures up to the rest of their career easily. I'm not sure this is a direction I'd have wanted Candlemass to stay performing for the rest of their career, but I wish we could have seen another 2-3 albums from this lineup. Hell, even if they did a sideproject together with Vikstrom, I'd have been extremely happy. Unfortunately, due to \"Chapter VI's\" poor reception, Candlemass would take a decent hiatus, and when they did return, it'd be with a TOTALLY different lineup, and an even bigger departure in terms of style.\n",
        "\nAfter Candlemass stumbled a little bit out of the gate when making \"Ancient Dreams,\" their final of the classic Messiah-era albums \"Tales of Creation\" came back with a fiery vengeance. This album is without a doubt the best release Messiah sang on. A ton of material on this record was actually written even prior to the band's debut, but was rewritten and reworked Regardless, the slightly pretentious feeling on \"Ancient Dreams\" is gone, and the song writing goes back to having the epic doom-y vibe the band has always made their living on. Beyond even that, everyone is at the top of their game on \"Tales of Creation.\" The riff writing is stellar, and Messiah really provides some of his best work here. There are a lot of little surprises across this record that makes it incredibly refreshing too.\n\nThe biggest of these surprises is the instrumental \"Into the Unfathomed Tower.\" It's in my top three instrumentals of all time. No Messiah? No problem. For a band that is known for their slow paced hammering doom tracks, this song smacks you right across the face with speed and brilliant playing. I have no hesitation in saying that Candlemass has brought subtle and classy power metal influences later in their career to mix in with the doom, but \"Into the Unfathomed Tower\" is definitely their first hint of some power metal influence. Upon saying that, though, it's not like this track is entirely out of left field and unfitting. The rhythm melodies on the song, and the light atmospheric keyboards behind it still give a very dark feel that Candlemass is known for. Lars Johansson is absolute fire on the song, and Mappe is keeping up and harmonizing with him to not be outdone either. Their playing is fast, precise, and also amazingly catchy. Johansson in particular is changing constantly during the track between more crafted, written solo parts, and more free-form solos, which makes it even more captivating. Every note is addicting and adrenaline fueling. Jan Lindh's tight, quick, and powerful drumming shows he's no slouch either. This was Candlemass' way of saying \"Don't you DARE think we're not masters of our instruments just because we normally play slower.\" My personal favorite track on the record that has Messiah's vocals is \"Through the Infinitive Halls of Death.\" After a short, slow intro section that builds the feel and mood of the track, the song features another much quicker main riff than Candlemass is usually known for. It's a crunchy, aggressive riff for Messiah to sing over. This is how Messiah shines best. His soaring high melodies are a beautiful juxtaposition from the lower, darker riff underneath him. The song has a really brilliant 'heaven and hell' feel (I don't mean the Black Sabbath track/album) due to his melodic high vocals, and the damning lower riffs. Once again, Lindh gives his main beat a cool feel with a ride cymbal pattern that has some space and weight to it compared to his constant pounding double bass work. The chorus of the track maintains a forlorn motif that the slower intro alluded to. \"Through the Infinitive Halls of Death\" is one of the more crafted, cared for Candlemass songs on the record, and it shows.\n\nThe title track is a fantastic and underrated song from the band. It has a pounding, stomping groove going for it, and Messiah's vocals are electric on the track. His held high-note vibratos really show what an incredible singer he is. The riff underneath the chorus is a powerful, yet melodic one, and Messiah's vocal melodies give one of the catchiest Candlemass choruses ever. Both his vocals and the chorus riff perfectly compliment each other. The very light atmospheric keyboards add a ton for the mood as well. The track closes with an incredible riff that is actually a slightly slower version of one used on the album's intro track. It gives the album a terrific feel of being book-ended by this riff. It's a really fantastic one that is also both catchy and very heavy. The fact that the band decided to do this really gives \"Tales of Creation\" a story-book feeling that helps it stand out. \"Tears\" is another song from the record that doesn't get the attention it deserves. The track's main riff is another staple dreary Candlemass riff that speaks volumes in terms of atmosphere all by itself. It's also another song where Messiah is absolutely at the top of his game. I've said a few times that I don't find Messiah to be the most emotional or expressive singer, but this is definitely a track that begs to differ. His main vocal melodies are as equally downtrodden as the track's main riff. He has a sadness that's absolutely fitting of the song's mood and title. The solo section of \"Tears\" features some more delightful guitar work, and Lindh is giving a lot subtle but fitting and flashy fills all across it. It's a more direct and to-the-point track, but it explores all it needs to in order to be great in the time it plays.\n\nHowever, even though I think Messiah does a fantastic job on tons of songs on this record, he drops the ball on the remake of \"Under the Oak.\" Pretty much everything about this version of the song, maybe minus the solos, is vastly inferior to the version featured on the debut. Messiah just has no ability to sing with the same kind of absolutely miserable and doomed feeling that Johan had on the debut. Comparing the slower melodic section of both songs is night and day. Messiah's performance gives this weak gentle feeling that doesn't at all fit. Meanwhile Johan sounded like he was literally watching the world die around him. It might have ended up decent if there was no original version to compare the track to, but as it stands, there's no reason for this version to exist. Despite being one of the more popular tracks on the record, I actually find \"Dark Reflections\" to be the weakest new track on the album. It's still a solid Candlemass song, and it's far better than half of the \"Ancient Dreams\" record, but it's a step down on \"Tales of Creation.\" The main riff is just a very weak, very typical one that isn't catchy, isn't all that heavy, and doesn't really have any good progression to it. It just kind of chugs along. The chorus section actually has a very cool, mystical feeling to it that definitely holds the song up enough to make it worthy, but I don't find the tune has much going for it despite this.\n\nThis would be Messiah's last Candlemass record for a bit less than ten years, so it's really fitting that he left the band on such a high note. \"Tales of Creation\" is the best this era would ever offer, and it's definitely one of the best records of their entire career. There are few other records with such a precise and deliberate onslaught of great and varying material that always remains fresh as this record has. Many people consider this album to be the last 'great' record for the band, but I strongly disagree with that. Candlemass would have very few missteps in their career, with or without Messiah. The album that directly follows \"Tales of Creation\" is a perfect example of one that would be gravely passed over simply due to the loss of a singer.\n",
        "\nCandlemass started their career with a near flawless debut, and followed that up with a phenomenal album in \"Nightfall.\" After two releases of that caliber, I really don't know how they missed the mark so much with \"Ancient Dreams.\" Now, I wouldn't go as far to call it a bad album, but it's certainly not great. For sure, it's Candlemass' worst album if you're to bar both \"Dactylis Glomerata\" and \"From the 13th Sun,\" which, as I pointed out last time, are incredibly different styles of albums. There are some gems on \"Ancient Dreams,\" but there is so much dead weight along with it, that it becomes a frustrating listen. There's a lot about this record that I'd call pretentious. A ton of songs put an insanely heavy focus on Messiah, and even though he's a phenomenally technically singer, he doesn't have the range of emotion to be in such a forefront. It takes more than technical skill and excellent notes to capture attention fully.\n\nMost of my complaints about \"Ancient Dreams\" are summed up in \"Incarnation of Evil.\" The main riff is so painfully boring. Messiah's vocal melodies are actually very good ones, but with basically no backbone behind him musically, it really enhances all of his flaws as a singer and puts them in the spotlight. His notes are technically gorgeous, but I hear no real emotion in his voice. The notes are there, but without a dreaded emotion that doom metal positively NEEDS, the song sinks into the ground. When Messiah isn't singing, the fact that the riffs and instrumental portion of the song are so dull and boring becomes a forefront, and when he does, his bandmates let him down. The song is also 7 minutes long as well, so to call this one a snooze is an understatement. \"Incarnation of Evil\" isn't an awful song (we shall get there), but sometimes boring can be even worse. \"Darkness in Paradise\" is only marginally better. Edling gives a nice bass groove to give the song some energy, and the track's main riff is at least better than what they tried with \"Incarnation of Evil.\" This song shows that the problem is Messiah, and not the rest of the band. Once again, when he's the one taking the lead over Edling's great bass riff, the song is as flat as an ironing board. Just like before, his physical notes are fantastic, but there's just no spine to them. There's no fire and no passion or emotion. This isn't to say that Messiah never had emotion to his voice, as he certainly has on other tracks, but still, he's just not the right kind of singer to take such a big role by himself. He's a singer that absolutely NEEDS a band to support him. The solo section on \"Darkness in Paradise\" is fantastic, though. That section almost saves the song by itself. The keyboard part that follows bestows an atmospheric tension that should have been built upon, but instead, if's wasted when Messiah's near-isolated parts come back. This one might have really been salvageable with a lot of its fat trimmed off.\n\nDespite my negativity up to this point, I still feel strongly that \"Ancient Dreams\" still has some Candlemass magic going for it. \"A Cry from the Crypt\" is a masterpiece of theirs. The song starts with a really spooky, eerie riff that sets up a great mood, and then the quicker one that comes in after and becomes the verse riff sets a galloping pace that still keeps that sinister mood. Messiah's vocals are extraordinary here. His held high notes work wonders in a song like this where the band is fully supporting him and giving him a leg to stand on. Even though I never thought Messiah was a super fitting doom singer, he's actually able to really drive home that haunting feel of the song. Johansson's solo is a really impressive one on this track. The way the guitars harmonize the intro riff after it is captivating. Finally, the last riff introduced in the song that fades it out is one of my favorites from Candlemass. The way they once again harmonize the riff as it fades out makes the song feel incredibly miserable and dreary in the best way possible. \"Bearer of Pain\" is another personal favorite of mine off the album. The main riff isn't one of Candlemass' strongest, but the verse riff syncs up really well with Messiah, and gives both him and the band the right amount of shine and breathing room at the same time. The chorus is excellent, and Messiah really enhances it further with his perfectly placed high note at the end of it each time. The best part of the entire song is definitely the mid-section of it that gives a really brilliant and unique middle eastern-like flare to the riff and vocal melodies. Messiah is basically note for note with the riff, and it gives both more power. Candlemass dabs into this sort of thing later in their career, but it's a pretty special feel on \"Ancient Dreams.\" I also love the concise and abrupt ending the song has. It feels like it could continue more, but then just shuts the door.\n\nI've talked about the mediocre, and I've talked about the good. Now comes the REALLY bad parts of the album. The title track is an absolute abomination. Easily in the running for worst Candlemass track of all time. The riff is a random one with no real decent melody or feel behind it. It doesn't groove nicely, it's not catchy...it's nothing but annoying. Then we have Messiah who comes in and basically matches each random dull note the riff is playing. Yet Messiah sounds far more bored than the guitars do, so every word and note spoken is just an affront to the ears. If you can call the chorus a 'chorus,' it's one of the blandest, weakest, and flat choruses of their career. Besides the solo section and a slight bit towards the ending, the song has absolutely no variation to it, either. It's such a criminally annoying, random, dull track. I absolutely struggle to listen to the song entirely without skipping it each time I throw the album on. \"Epistle No. 81\" is no better either. It's stock, paint by numbers riffing from the band, and Messiah is absolutely rambling on it. His notes sound more awful than my words can describe. They're bored, have absolutely no depth nor emotion to them, and have no melody whatsoever. His vocals on this song sounds like you got your tone deaf uncle drunk and taped him mumbling incoherently on the toilet. This is an unacceptable track that has absolutely zero point in needing to exist. Just stop the album after \"The Bells of Acheron\" (which is another REALLY good track, by the way.) \n\nIn general, Candlemass has such an amazingly stellar discography, and I wouldn't go so far as to call \"Ancient Dreams\" a failure, but it's one of the worst for sure. In a discography full of diamonds, a pearl seems worse in comparison. There's no question to me that it's a 50/50 release. Half with gems and great material, half with utter dull, random, unpleasant garbage. The band sounds like they were really trying to be ambitious with this release, but with that, they lost sight of a lot of what got them to the top of the mountain in the first place. Fortunately, though, this was a one time momentary slip-up, as when it came time for their next release, Candlemass got right back on the saddle. \"Ancient Dreams\" is worthy of some listens due to the handful of quality tracks on it, but some of the magic was undoubtedly missing on it.\n",
        "\nAfter a legendary debut release, Candlemass had to repopulate the band when shaping up to deliver \"Nightfall.\" Even though this is the sequel, and you may look at this album and feel it's longer than the debut, it actually still only has six songs if you take away the instrumental build-up and lead in songs. Along with Edling and Bjorkman, Jan Lindh and Lars Johansson joined on drums and lead guitar respectively. These four would definitely be the most consistent Candlemass lineup instrumentally; only deviating for two albums from this point on. Messiah Marcolin takes vocal duties, and he's probably the most famous Candlemass singer. Time for a bit of blasphemy on my part. Messiah is probably my least favorite Candlemass vocalist if you bar \"Dactylis Glomerata\" and \"From the 13th Sun,\" since those were a DRAMATICALLY different style of Candlemass. Don't get me wrong. I still LOVE Messiah and the material he helped to create. He's a technically amazing singer, but I never found that his soaring high vocals were a bulls-eye of a fit for doom masters like Candlemass. Of course, his voice fits his own songs just fine most of the time, but I always felt like he missed something in the qualities of his voice that most of their other singers nailed.\n\nTo stave off the torches and pitchforks I hear coming my way, I will point out that \"The Well of Souls\" is my favorite Candlemass track of all time. The main riff is just so insanely heavy, but also very catchy in a doom metal way. It's one of my favorite riffs ever, and Edling's bass line enhances the weight behind it more. Messiah is absolutely on FIRE on this track. He hits some of his highest notes ever at the end of some of the verse lines, which adds a very unique enhancement to them. Lindh's steady double bass parts keep a grooving head banging feeling going across the entire song. The riff following the chorus is a very ominous one that gives Messiah a great stage to sing on. The song has a tremendous amount of varying parts to help it stay fresh and strong. All of them give the track a slightly different flare and feel. The slow riff after the solo is another personal favorite of mine. Despite the simplicity, it's still heavy, and incredibly powerful. It fades out with an eerie keyboard choir part that matches the riff. \"The Well of Souls\" is a tune that fires from all cylinders. \"At the Gallows End\" is another track that just gets it right. The intro mixes clean electric guitar and acoustic to give a dynamic flow of heavy and beautiful. When Messiah enters, simple but driving electric guitar is added, and keeps the doom-y roots of the song despite Messiah's beautiful melodies. The song's main riff is the epitome of head-bangable. It's a quick, chugging riff for doom standards, but the closing few notes add a sinister and angry flare. Messiah's quickened pace is spaced from the riff very well so that they're both noticeable, and neither is lost. The softer intro section returns midway in to leave breathing room, and the song's solo is excellent. \"At the Gallows End\" is one of Candlemass' most energetic pieces, and it makes a brilliant addition to the album.\n\n\"Bewitched\" is absolutely the band's second most popular song behind \"Solitude.\" I like \"Bewitched\" FAR more than \"Solitude.\" The song's main riff is trademark Candlemass. A dark, somber riff that still has intense heaviness while retaining a level of catchiness too. It has such an incredible groove and flow to it. Every riff the track delivers follows suit in an impressive way. Nothing gets repetitive on this song like I feel \"Solitude\" gets. Messiah is very fitting on the track; able to tell a story with his voice very intimately. He really dials back his voice to set the tale up, but also adds his famous soaring melodies at opportune times to give them meaning. The chorus is a fantastic one, and Lindh's tom slams that match the guitar give it a little bit of an anthem-like feel. \"Bewitched\" is definitely a prime track that was excellently crafted. \"Samarithan\" gives \"Nightfall\" its fill of mystical and dramatic story telling. The track's main riff is once again a pretty simple one, but it gives off the perfect depressing mood. Messiah's higher vocal range and incredible vibrato are dead ringers for this song's angelic yet forlorn feel. His wordless callings interspersed sell the strange but magical journey the song takes. The small lead parts between verses are a fantastic addition to the song to give it space for the story's progression while still adding interesting elements to it. The main solo as well picks the pace up just a little and gives the tune a little bit of a shot in the arm that helps its advancing flow without growing boring. \"Samarithan\" is truly a doom lovers paradise.\n\nUnfortunately, though, unlike the debut, which had six songs that packed the album to the brim with shining moments, one of \"Nightfall's\" six is a dud that weighs it down in comparison. \"Mourners Lament\" just can't hang with the album's other five songs. While far from Candlemass' worst song, the main riff of the song definitely meanders around quite a lot. It still keeps a doom-y atmosphere to make sure the flow of the album doesn't stagnate, but the riffs seem a bit more random and less polished to me. Messiah's vocals are pretty much the same. His vocal melodies are just all over the place and never finish on a strong groove or rhythm. If either the guitars or Messiah were on their A game for this track, it might have been able to save the other, but both of them are far from at the top of their game on \"Mourners Lament.\" It really weighs the whole experience down. It's just a rather boring track that doesn't seem like it truly knew what it was trying to accomplish.\n\nCandlemass was absolutely fighting an uphill battle on \"Nightfall\" by trying to live up to the expectations set after the debut. While I think this record is a bit of a step down overall, it's still an absolutely phenomenal record with showcases from each individual member across the entire record. This album set a precedent of what people expect to hear when they pop in both Candlemass and also any kind of doom record in general that has clean vocals. Even though the band had their problems with Messiah, he'd stay around for a couple of more releases at this point to further define and craft the band's sound. \"Nightfall\" is without a doubt another essential album that should be in your collection.\n",
        "\nCandlemass really needs no introduction, as they essentially wrote the book on doom metal. Despite the cringe worthy album title, the music itself is incredible. The band had it right from their very debut, and have had a very consistent career ever since. Their debut lineup features consummate band leader Leif Edling on bass and staple member Mats Bjorkman on guitar. This would be the only album appearances for Mats Ekstrom on drums and Klas Bergwall on lead guitar. Johan Langquist makes an appearance on vocals, and it'd be his only Candlemass performance for over twenty years. \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus\" shows that the age-old saying 'quality over quantity' is absolutely true. Despite only being six songs long, every single one of them packs a powerful punch.\n\nMy personal favorite on the record has always been the closer \"A Sorcerer's Pledge.\" It's a journey of a track in the truest sense. The song begins with a decently long acoustic intro part, but despite being a two minute intro, it doesn't drag at all. The acoustic melody is eerie, and Langquist's vocals are dramatically haunting and terrified. His vocals in general on this record are just absolutely perfectly fitting for the atmosphere it creates. The effects of swirling wind around him along with the keyboards making almost whistling sounds give the intro a very cold and ominous feel all by itself. After about half the intro, Edling's bass enters very subtly to give a bit more weight to the segment. When the heaviness of the song picks up, we're greeted with a fantastically heavy riff, and a tremendous scream from Langquist. The pace gives a solid groove with varying feels to all of the riffs. The fact that there's a lot of variation in the pace and feeling of a couple of riffs on the song means that everything stays familiar as the story progresses, but also never gets stale. Langquist's vocals stay dramatic, but he intersperses elements of a sinister nature all throughout the track. The song slows down towards the end with an eerie keyboard part, and a wonderful beat from Ekstrom. Finally, the song closes with some absolutely beautiful female vocals that are chilling, but also have a catchy melody. It's an incredible ending to such an impressive track. \"Demons Gate\" is another track on the album with a long run time that is worth every moment. It's not quite a journey in the same way \"A Sorcerer's Pledge\" is, but it's incredibly powerful the whole way through. After a short keyboard intro, the song kicks in with a trudging, heavy riff. Edling is also playing some impressive bass parts underneath it that shouldn't be overlooked. Once Langquist comes in, the riffs vary between giving him space to sing, and then also having a catchy heavy feeling once he's holding his notes. During the verses, everyone is shining at proper moments. Ekstrom's double bass grooves are placed at opportune moments to enhance the song's mood. A bit less than halfway in, Edling's simple, but downtrodden bass parts lead into a strong solo. The solo itself is probably the best part of the song. The way it layers upon itself is magically done, and it's also extremely singable despite how dark and sinister it is. Once the solo ends, Langquist is repeating his verses from earlier, but he gives them a much darker, tortured feel as opposed to the deeper, doomier one he had before to demonstrate the song's progression.\n\nOf course, \"Solitude\" is pretty much Candlemass' biggest staple song, so not mentioning it would be a great disservice. Quite honestly, it's far from my favorite Candlemass track, and may be my least favorite on the record. I definitely still enjoy it, and listen to it often enough, but it probably wouldn't even make my top 25 songs from the band. The mood the song creates is absolute pure dread. It weighs on the mind with brilliantly executed misery. The track is all about that mood and atmosphere it creates. Beyond that mood, though, it's just a bit too repetitive for to call it one of their best. Riff wise and vocal melody wise, as good a feeling as they both create, they both just go on a bit too long and often for me. \"Solitude\" is a fantastic track for what it helped build and create, but the band and this album both have much more to offer musically than this song. \"Crystal Ball\" is the song on the record that is most underrated for me. The intro/chrous riff of the song is an amazing one. It sets a fantastic tone, and also is pretty catchy in its own doom-y right. Langquist is able to use his deeper register to give the track the mystical nature the title'd suggest it'd have. Despite this, he crafts his high notes exactly where is needed to give the track a punch; especially on the chorus where he shines. After a short solo, Edling gives another memorable bass part to start kicking the track into high gear. The quicker segment of this song is a great combination of sinisterly catchy, heavy, and driving. Ekstrom's double bass work really pounds this part of the song ahead.\n\n\"Black Stone Wielder\" also deserves a bit more attention than it gets. It's another track that Langquist really sells. I don't think any of his replacements ever captured the nature and energy of this song when playing it live the same way he was able to. His vocal qualities really paint the perfect picture in the listener's mind. All of his notes, and the way he emphasizes certain words are masterfully done. It's a hard concept to appreciate, but telling a story with these kinds of vocal qualities alone are not something most singers are easily capable of. You could show one hundred singers this song, and ask them to sing in the same way, and ninety nine of them couldn't capture the emotion and narration like he did. The song's main riff paints a more rushed feeling, as if the listener is being chased by a force unseen. At the same time, the riffs played when Langquist isn't singing give a bit more breath, and let the instrumental heaviness stand for itself. The final new riff of the song after a wonderful chorus leads it in is a great riff to culminate the tale and nature that there'd been up to this point. As a final note, this album has the best version of \"Under the Oak.\" The re-release on \"Tales of Creation\" doesn't hold a match to this one, let alone a candle. This is solely due to Langquist's jaw-droppingly emotional and sad range during the acoustic section midway through. Messiah might have been a technically better singer than Langquist, but he was far from an expressively or emotionally better singer.\n\nCandlemass was off to the races after the release of \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus.\" Despite a majority of the band changing after this debut, their quality stayed very strong. Though Johan Langquist would come back for a few demos and live appearances, he didn't truly return to the fold for more than 20 years after this release. Candlemass would have great releases with pretty much every singer that took the helm, but Langquist deserve massive credit for being a big part in giving them such a dynamite start. It always makes me wonder what Candlemass would have been if he stayed from day one. Their debut is a rare example of a band's first seed growing into one of their biggest trees. Candlemass didn't need time to take root and grow like most bands do. They had the right idea from day one.\n",
        "\nFor a long time now, I\u2019ve been quite obsessed by how artists perceive their own work. Just a trip down metal\u2019s history pages will reveal several artists whose own views on their oeuvre is wildly at odds with that of their fanbase. Some more notable ones might be in Tom G. Warrior\u2019s book, Are You Morbid?, wherein he praises the best-forgotten Vanity Nemesis whilst not really having much positive to say about To Mega Therion. I imagine his view might be somewhat different now, mind you. Unlike our favourite Swiss beanie-enthusiast, Leif Edling has at least been somewhat consistent in his poor view of Ancient Dreams (tellingly, I believe the band played an Ancient Dreams set whilst Edling was inactive as a live musician). However, I\u2019m quite sure you\u2019ll not find too many (read: hardly any) Candlemass fans who share his view of what is, simply put, another fine work from their classic era. \n\nThe criticisms I\u2019ve heard at this record are wide-ranging but nonetheless they mostly leave me a little confounded. Firstly, the production is deemed to be terrible. Now, I can understand this point-of-view from its makers; after all, the frustration of your own creation not being as you heard it in your head must be palpable. For the rest of us, however; let\u2019s keep things in perspective! Sure, Ancient Dreams isn\u2019t as smoky and evocative as Epicus\u2026 and it doesn\u2019t have the instant advantage of Nightfall\u2019s obvious step-up in terms of budget, but anyone complaining about this within the context of the realms of 80\u2019s metal needs to spend more time with Destruction\u2019s Eternal Devastation and its teeth-splitting treble or Metal from Hell by Satan\u2019s Host (is that a guitar or did they just run a vacuum cleaner through a distortion pedal?). Honestly, I think this a suitably grandiose sounding record with enough polish and depth to allow the guitars to shine and Messiah, obviously, takes the spotlight in the mix. \n\nSpeaking of which, I\u2019ve heard criticisms towards Messiah\u2019s performance on this record as being \u201ctoo gothic\u201d. Obviously, a song like \u2018A Cry from the Crypt\u2019 is usually considered the main offender. However, I do wonder what critics were expecting from a song with that title? If nothing else, in such a context I don\u2019t think one can be too gothic. Furthermore, it\u2019s not like any of Messiah\u2019s previous performances had been anywhere near understated; he\u2019s the loud, proud guy in a monk\u2019s outfit\u2026 never one to shy away from being the owner of metal\u2019s finest warbling, wobbly vibrato. These people aren\u2019t fit to eat Messiah\u2019s cold McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers, I tell ya. \n\nFor the rest of us, then, there\u2019s a suitably dramatic performance full of all the pathos and over-the-top melancholy that made the epic part of doom metal. If he wasn\u2019t a metal singer (one whose absence from the scene is baffling \u2013 c\u2019mon, man, you\u2019ve got that voice, you should be out there using it!) I could imagine Messiah in theatre. Maybe having a bit part in Shakespeare where the actors \u2013 given the frequently minimalistic use of props \u2013 have to create the setting using their words only. One can imagine that Messiah wouldn\u2019t struggle to create the freezing fog on a cold night at Elsinore with just a rhyming couplet. \n\nOf course, the other more pressing criticism seems to be that this is one record wherein Candlemass coast by on their fantastic sound, capitalising on the success of two stellar records before it. In fairness, though, I think the only fair criticism that I see levelled at Ancient Dreams is that it isn\u2019t necessarily one of the top-ten doom metal records of all time like its predecessors. Which is a shockingly stringent criticism, if ever there was one. Whilst The Skull or Mournful Cries aren\u2019t as strong as, say, Psalm 9 or Hallows Victim I\u2019d say they absolutely deserve a place in the collection of even those who have a fair-weather interest in doom. The same can be said for Ancient Dreams. In fact, consider it a worthy place of refuge after you\u2019ve \u2013 inevitably \u2013 overplayed the first two Candlemass records somewhat. So, consider that a massive benefit! \n\nFurthermore, you have the sense that the band breathe a little better on this record: having been established as more of a \u201cstudio-project\u201d on the first two albums (in the fine, Bathory-approved tradition of not playing live), the band finally got out on tour after Nightfall\u2019s release and they reap the rewards here. It might be a somewhat nebulous issue to take, but Nightfall is just a little stiffer rhythmically than Ancient Dreams and it seems that the band are slightly more developed in their roles (ironically, the band used a click track on this record for the first time). Of course, Lars Johansson is a masterful player and, it seems to me, that he would be more than capable of being a guitar-hero bandleader in any other project (he is, however, too astute of a player and knows that the songs have to shine first and, therefore, plays accordingly \u2013 not accordion, that would be weird). Additionally, the band are keen to flex their harmony guitar muscles a little more on this record, which makes for wonderful interplay and tends to \u2018liven\u2019 up some of Leif\u2019s more leaden riffs, which is occasionally necessary given his somewhat single-minded approach to writing here. \n\nI should note that these criticisms are not necessarily ones I\u2019ve read on this site, but nonetheless, Ancient Dreams is a mandatory record for fans of the band. Go forth, seek it out if you haven\u2019t already and maybe give it another spin if you\u2019ve been sleeping on it.\n",
        "\nIf you can't already tell by my glowing review of \"Nightfall,\" \"Samarithan\" is a great song. Who said doom had to be dark and depressing? It's strangely uplifting, I can't think of many other non-Christian metal songs with such a happy ending. And musically, it's as top quality as the rest of the album. The riffwork is as great as always, simple but powerful. And Messiah Marcolin sounds terrific, making some good use of his lower register in the start of the first few verses before shifting to a higher range for the ending. It's just a great song, and a good choice for a single.\n\nAs a b-side, Candlemass has re-recorded two tracks from \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus,\" the classic songs \"Solitude\" and \"Crystal Ball.\" It's interesting to see how Messiah's voice contrasts with that of original vocalist Johan Langquist, he's a bit more operatic and dramatic than Langquist, and it puts a new spin on the songs. It's very worthwhile listen, even if you're very attached to the original versions.\n",
        "\nThe best way I can describe \"Nightfall\" is that it plays out like a 46 minute orchestral piece played by a metal band. If you close your eyes during some of the instrumental passages, it's not hard to picture a symphony taking place in front of you. There's enough melodrama here to push everything just the right amount over the top, but not too much where it devolves into sappiness. \n\nProbably the thing that'll stick out most to you is the man himself, Messiah Marcolin. As legend has it, he got the gig in Candlemass by calling Leif Edling in the middle of the night, declared, \"I'm your new singer,\" and sang \"Solitude\" into the phone. And he brought just as much bravado to his performance here. His voice is towering and dramatic, perfect for those who aren't afraid of a little cheesiness, because his power and range is truly fantastic here. \"Mourner's Lament\" contains one of my all time favorite vocal performances in metal history. Messiah plays the role of a grieving father perfectly, managing to sound on the edge of losing his sanity from grief while his powerful voice is as strong as ever.\n\nAnd of course, that's not to discount every other element of the album. Leif Edling's songwriting ability is at its best, and he proves himself able to write some truly incredible riffs. Being doom metal, there's a sort of raw simplicity to the songs, many of the riffs are just single string melodies, but in the hands of Candlemass they sound massive and towering. \"Samarithan\" is a great example of this; at its core it's a pretty simple song, but every single element of it works to perfection. Lead guitarist Lars Johansson has an expressive, melodic style to his soloing, and the solos don't feel shoehorned in or forced, they feel like a natural extension of the song. The production has a bit of a raw, live feel to it. The guitars have a nice fuzzy bite, and I love the massive, booming sound of the drums. Usually I prefer a tighter, less reverb-y drum sound, but that's the beauty of this album, I guess. \"Dark Are The Veils Of Death\" is a microcosm of everything great about this album: titanic yet catchy riffs, operatic vocals, and thundering drums, that stretch on long enough that you're not left wanting more, but not to the point where you lose interest.\n\nEven the lyrics are top notch. There's a gothic flair to them, and it casts Messiah in the role of the wizened old storyteller informing the young ones of the trials and tribulations of life. In an old Headbanger's Ball interview, Messiah has described their lyrics as neither Pro-Christianity or Pro-Satanism, but merely as stories of good and evil. And judging by the characters in these songs, that sounds like a pretty accurate assessment: a grieving father looking for answers, a condemned man on his last morning alive, the strange bewitching villain of \"Bewitched.\" \n\nIf I had to pick a minor quibble with this album, some of the instrumental interludes can feel a bit excessive at times, but in the grand scheme of things, that's a minor speck on its greatness. Go listen to \"Nightfall,\" you won't regret it.\n",
        "\nSweden's Candlemass is a band that needs no introduction. Significant to heavy metal history, they've influenced countless doom metal bands over the years. If you come across a doom metal band that has a singer with an operatic vocal range like King Diamond or Rob Halford, chances are they're influenced by Candlemass. I'll be reviewing their debut album, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, often considered to be one of their two most important releases. Expect a few instances of the word \"mesmerizing\".\n\nEpicus Doomicus Metallicus as a whole is a highlight, but most notably \"Solitude\" and \"Demon's Gate\". \"Solitude\" is probably the big hit on the album and coincidentally shares its name with a Black Sabbath song. Johan L\u00e4ngquist displays an operatic voice that's pretty much a mix of Ozzy Osbourne and King Diamond and shines throughout the song. \"Demon's Gate\" is in my opinion the definition of the epic doom metal subgenre that Candlemass pioneered as it lasts for over nine minutes. The downtuned riffs benefit this song a lot and I'd say it's L\u00e4ngquist's best vocal performance. If you want to request a metal song at a Halloween party, this eerie number is an excellent choice.\n\nEven the musicians had no clue what they were doing at the time. Johan L\u00e4ngquist was actually a session musician on Epicus Doomicus Metallicus and because of the album's failure at the time, he was replaced with the legendary Messiah Marcolin. Unlike Marcolin who was a tenor, L\u00e4ngquist was a baritone and doesn't have the same range as the former. I still prefer his performance on this album compared to The Door to Doom. The lead guitarist, Klas Bergwall was also a session musician and his solos are as mesmerizing as L\u00e4ngquist's vocals, with rhythm guitarist Mappe having his own melancholic solos in turn. The bandleader Leif Edling wrote some really good songs on Epicus Doomicus Metallicus with \"Crystal Ball\" having some really cool chorus lyrics:\n\nGaze into the crystal, see what it tells\nIt can bring you all fortune, do you so well\n\nVisions and dreams you can see in the Crystal ball\n\nI know that Johan L\u00e4ngquist sang the songs but Edling needs a shoutout for his mesmerizing lyrics coupled with his bass playing that likely made him the Geezer Butler of the 80s. The drumming provided by Mats Ekstr\u00f6m is well synchronized with the instrumentation most notably on Side B cuts \"Black Stone Wielder\" and \"A Sorcerer's Pledge\", which is just so mindblowing.\n\nBut in the end, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is a mindblowing masterpiece for its time. You could never find a \"Son of Sabbath\" that had a vocalist that was inspired by King Diamond before this album. This album notably inspired US-based Solitude Aeturnus, whose singer Robert Lowe notably became the frontman of Candlemass following Messiah Marcolin's third departure with the band. It's one of the most essential doom metal albums ever made with a strong vocal performance and mesmerizing instrumentation to boot. Make sure you have it in your metal album collection.\n",
        "\nBeing a huge Candlemass fan of old, I was quite enthusiastic for this new release and especially for Johan L\u00e4ngquist\u2019s return on vocals, which was totally unexpected. Many dreadful signs tended towards a honored retirement for the Swedish band, whom I believed oriented to an ending of a grand career as masters of doom. My fears were instead wiped out by the signs that a new production was coming. Creeping up here and there, the teasers for the new album were all so captivating, such as the rumors of Tony Iommi\u2019s collaboration and the album artwork itself (with that clever hint of Epicus Doomicus), that I couldn\u2019t wait to listen to it. \n\nThe first time listening of The Door to Doom was a great experience and I really enjoyed the album a lot. The more I listened to it, however, the more flaws I discovered and suddenly I realized that behind a veil of back-to-basic doom it was almost the same as the latest albums from the Rob Lowe\u2019s era. The album has a captivating atmosphere as Candlemass has used us to from the very start. But is it really a \u201cdoor to Doom\u201d? Not really; let\u2019s find out why. \n\nThe opening track, \u201cSplendour Demon\u2019s Majesty\u201d, starts by oozing Candelmass with a majestic riff and doom sound. Yet something is lacking, you do not get what exactly until you reach the chorus and are so introduced to the real problem present throughout this album: the weak, blend choruses (more of this below). \u201cUnder the Ocean\u201d has a lot of potential but is somewhat too confused in its composition to be correctly evaluated: you feel a lack of coherence throughout the song, even if it summons rather well the sensation of being underwater in dark, strange and unfamiliar surroundings. \u201cAstorolus \u2013 the Great Octopus\u201d is perhaps the best track on this album: the doom sound is heavy and fluid, the main riff is immediately entering your head, never to leave and sticking there just as an octopus\u2019 tentacle. Johan\u2019s vocals here are really good, and furthermore the track is enriched by an stout riff by nonetheless than Mr. Tony \u201cI-invented-metal\u201d Iommi. \n\n\u201cAstorolus\u201d is one of the few tracks from this album that really got my attention and I kept headbanging throughout the whole song. The rest of the album is made of decent tracks, with good riffs but not much more than that. The ballad \u201cBridge of the Blind\u201d is an interesting interlude but it does not have much to do on this album. It is something that reminds you of older Candlemass production, yet not that epic nor doomish. Even if not unpleasant, and frankly very beautiful due to Johan\u2019s great vocal interpretation, it has little to do with the general atmosphere of the rest of the album, made of faster rhythms and more powerful style. I do not despise it, not at all. Maybe it was better if put as closure, right there in the middle is a little bit out of place but perhaps it can be appreciated as a moment of \u201crest\u201d between the first and second part of the album. \n\n\u201cThe Omega Circle\u201d is far too long and straight out tedious: it\u2019s not that good to endure it neither too bad just to jump over it. A listening dilemma that could have been avoided by cutting its length, which would have also improved the quality of the song.\n\nMusically speaking, Candlemass deliver as usual also in The Door to Doom, no doubt about it. Johan is a pleasant surprise at vocals: he lost some of his epic and high-pitched touch from his younger days, but he has evolved his voice in a slightly rougher, rustier sound which goes well with the less epic sound which dominates the band\u2019s later work, this latest included. Leif Edling still manages to produce (mostly) good quality lyrics, and the album has a general atmosphere of impending doom, as you would expect. The problem, as mentioned before, is that in almost all the tracks you feel frustrated and disappointed for the sudden plunge into weakness: the doomish and sturdy riffs are lost in a weak, kind-of-AOR chorus. You often find yourself headbanging like hell to a song, only to see your arms fall down in frustration and your neck suddenly stop when the chorus come up. This is evident especially in \u201cWheel of time\u201d, \u201cBlack Trinity\u201d, \u201cHouse of Doom\u201d but also the rest of the songs, maybe except of \u201cAstorolus\u201d. This is a great pity, which makes this album not better than a fairly decent one, but which could have been so much greater. \n\nOne can say that The Door to Doom is a wink by Candlemass towards their origins, in intentions rather than facts. The sound and composition may never reach the heights of their first masterpiece albums, but it could have been so much doomier and heavy than what it actually turned out to be. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the tracks are good metal songs and the album is fully enjoyable (especially for a fan), but in the end it sounds just like the later productions, as Psalms for the Dead or Death Magic Doom. Nothing has really changed, and Leif\u2019s side projects\u2019 style is coming up here and there. If you expect a sound closer to the old Candlemass, you will not get it. With this said, it is indeed a strong album which delights the listener with high quality metal by no means unsatisfying. \n\nTo sum up: lacking a little bit in inspiration and rather working on the already established fan-base and proven sounds defined throughout the years, held together by the undisputable talent of Leif & co., the album can fit into the collection of any metalhead, and surely of any Candlemass\u2019 aficionado, but is nothing memorable that will last in memory. A pity, as this could easily be the band\u2019s swansong and for this you need more than a little nostalgic glimpse towards the grandeur of old days, trying to emulate it but still not really there.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve never been a fan of seeing a great band become a soap opera, so I\u2019ve mostly ignored the singer shenanigans that Candlemass have gone through in the last few years. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, since doom metal is like a soap opera in many ways, what with all the unexpected deaths, failed love stories, and plot twists, just with fewer weddings. And so, kind of like the long absent father, Johan L\u00e4ngquist returns unexpectedly for his second album more than 30 years after the seminal debut ushered in epic doom metal as a recognized musical force. In those years, Candlemass have become a little less epic but certainly no less doomy, not if a quick sniff at their guitar tone and bpm rates are anything to go by. Therefore, the pivotal question is this: was it worth re-entering the studio for The Door to Doom after previously promising an end to recorded output?\n\nThe answer you\u2019re getting from me, as a massive fan of the band across most of their career - despite taking in six vocalists and featuring rather a blip after the first reunion - is that having Candlemass releasing albums is always a good thing. Even the weak albums have managed to secure one trait out of entertaining, unusual, or crushing. The Door to Doom won\u2019t be ranked among the classics of these Swedish titans (already quite a haul, lest we forget), but it should join the likes of 2009\u2019s Death Magic Doom and 2012\u2019s Psalms for the Dead as both entertaining and crushing, which seems a pretty reasonable outcome from where I\u2019m sitting. In the studio, a very familiar line-up of four instrumentalists managed to combine their talents to produce eight diverting songs of earth-shaking heaviness, benefitting from a slightly grittier production than before and resulting in a modest attempt at keeping things fresh. The wild card, L\u00e4ngquist, delivers surprisingly well.\n\nTo dispel any doubts I should clear make it that The Door to Doom undoubtedly fits the mould of 21st century Candlemass: chunky riffing at both slow and mid-pace, no sense of abandonment or holiness as the old power metal tendencies made possible, and everything divulged within two or three listens. Nothing strongly involving like \u2018A Sorcerer\u2019s Pledge\u2019 harks back to the debut, nor has Leif Edling guided his troops to any serious risks, unless the brief ballad \u2018Bridge of the Blind\u2019 can be counted as such. Allowing L\u00e4ngquist to lead a mostly clean song in this manner proves a first, even if the same kind of ground has been covered with the solemn trudge of \u2018Epistle 81\u2019 and the introduction to band anthem \u2018Solitude\u2019. Closer 'The Omega Circle' impresses on the basis of a more evocative clean verse, ending the album on a high note with a sterling Lars Johannson solo and a rousing chorus. If only it wasn't for the pointless Sabbathian fade-out tacked onto the end. Reducing the running time of 'The Omega Circle' to its true six minutes, one can spy a very clear formula running through the album, only 'Bridge of the Blind' diverging from the longer trend. As such, creativity is rather lacking in terms of song structure and format. Due to that gripe, it would be difficult to say that The Door to Doom breaks any new ground or will surprise old fans, but Candlemass still sound awesome when they nail the simple stuff, as opener \u2018Splendor Demon Majesty\u2019 quickly points out.\n\nGenerally speaking, the best material greets the listener on arrival, clocking up a strong up-tempo number, a well-judged pounding riff on \u2018Under the Ocean\u2019, and an atmospheric guest solo from Tony Iommi on \u2018Astorolus - the Great Octopus\u2019 before things calm down for the ballad. The second half features rather more ordinary cuts, \u2018Death\u2019s Wheel\u2019 and \u2018Black Trinity\u2019 only achieving decency, while \u2018House of Doom\u2019 already had its own EP released with Mats Lev\u00e9n on vocals. As such, the album version is mildly different, actually sounding like the best fit for Psalms for the Dead owing to the gentle use of Hammond organ. You may be able to tell that I'm in two minds about the song quality here: on the one hand, Candlemass haven't been daft enough to release sub-par material or wander too far off course; then again, how many of these songs would make it into a greatest hits set? I'd guess only 'The Omega Circle' or 'Under the Ocean' and they couldn't fend off competition from any of the contenders from the '80s albums, nor probably their more similar counterparts from King of the Grey Islands.\n\nTherefore, pleased as I am that Candlemass are back in the business of making new albums, I probably won't be playing The Door to Doom all too often in the next few years. Yes, it was canny of the band to try and give the fans something they wanted, but what we'd really like to see is an album that defies a few expectations and shakes up the formula just enough to make this vigil exciting once more. The candle is not snuffed out, and the mass continues, though some of the old feeling is absent.\n",
        "\nThough many have come forth to construct their version of the colossal structure of impending woe that is epic doom metal, few have managed to even hold a candle to those that carry them en masse. At their prime, they built a grand castle with many great towering epics, casting a mighty shadow upon the metal masses and reminding them that after all the rage and violence is done that there is always time for despair. Opinions naturally vary regarding where the zenith of their career lays, with a great multitude pointing to the late 80s trilogy of operatic melancholy featuring dramatic tenor Messiah Marcolin, while other newer adherents of the grand funeral procession see greatness with Dio-inspired ex-Solitude Aeturnus front man Robert Lowe at the fore and the occasional oddball pointing to the brief stints with Mats Leven and Thomas Vikstrom at the mic. Only occasionally is the name Johan Langquist, the one-off session vocalist who gave the world this band\u2019s stellar debut Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, thrown into the mix given his extremely brief time in the fold.\n\nIn somewhat similar fashion to the reunion of Black Sabbath earlier in the decade, the original lineup that unleashed the original epic doom manifesto upon the world in 1986 has found itself reassembled more than three decades later to show the younger pallbearers who it\u2019s done. It is a somewhat fitting eventuality given that Langquist has been performing Candlemass\u2019 famed debut in its entirety live, on and off for several years, and more fitting still that 2019\u2019s The Door To Doom picks up right where the band left off 33 years prior as if this incarnation had never parted ways. This naturally comes with the caveat that founder and principle songwriter Leif Edling and company have not been oblivious to the ever-evolving world of studio technology and have crafted as slow marching masterwork that reminisces upon the style\u2019s primordial roots, yet is palpable to the ear of the late 2010s. This is the same band that ushered in the woeful, depressive odes \u201cSolitude\u201d and \u201cA Sorcerer\u2019s Pledge\u201d, and yet they are a changed one as well, like a wiser sage adorned with a deeper shade of gray upon his beard.\n\nThe best way to describe the sonic workings of this vintage yet fresh take on things is as a slightly darker, and perhaps a tinge more mechanized reflection of its 1986 equivalent. The same general atmospheric aesthetic of reverberating minimalist riffs, thudding drums and occasional layers of keyboard work crosses paths with a much more experienced and aged Langquist, who\u2019s powerful pipes have more of a classic old school metal attitude to them, resembling the smoky quality of Coverdale and the Dio-like grit of Robert Lowe rather than the agonized bellows and suicidal croons he contributed to Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. It arguably misses a tad bit of that organic realism that the band sort of accidentally stumbled upon the first time around, but it also comes off as more polished and will likely be more agreeable to the ears of younger fans of this outfit who may have passed upon the debut due to its rawness. All the same, the songwriting is about as faithful of reminiscence upon that mystical variety of darkness that Sabbath occasionally ventured into on their slower works during the Tony Martin days.\n\nEven more of a credit to this album\u2019s effectiveness is that it manages to present a variety of expressions within its simplistic and heavily classicist format. The creeping largess of \u201cBlack Trinity\u201d and the Lovecraftian nightmare ode \u201cAstorolus \u2013 The Great Octopus\u201d (featuring an astounding guitar solo guest slot by Tony Iommi, his first recording since Black Sabbath closed its case, in a grand passing of the torch moment) offers up the heaviest end of the spectrum. Meanwhile, the nimble driving character of opener \u201cSplendor Demon Majesty\u201d and the occasionally thrashing epic crusher \u201cHouse Of Doom\u201d (which also features a brilliant church organ solo, a looming bell tolling in the distance and plenty of atmospheric keyboard work) reminds all that you don\u2019t have to play slow all the time to capture the depths of misery. Topping off this monument of darkness are a collection of brilliant droning acoustic passages littering \u201cUnder The Ocean\u201d, \u201cThe Omega Circle\u201d and a full on ballad in \u201cBridge Of The Blind\u201d that showcases a more polished yet still organic clean vocal character out of Langquist to rival his seminal moments with this band decades back.\n\nMoving forward doesn\u2019t necessarily mean abandoning traditionalism; in fact, there is a fairly strong case to be made that without a traditional rooting that metal would have lost its way decades ago. What this album represents to the metal world in general, and doom metal in particular, is a traditional response to a changing world by embracing whatever new conventions will complement an already winning formula. Any stalwart fan of Candlemass will find every bit of what originally drew him or her to the band over the course of their time expanding a formula that reaches back to the earliest days of metal\u2019s longstanding history, whereas any newcomer will be greeted by something that isn\u2019t a throwback to a time they don\u2019t remember, but something real and current to complement the far more varied musical world to which they have been raised. The final chapter of the morbid tale that is epic doom metal has yet to be written, and God willing, it will hopefully not be the last one in this sorcerer\u2019s mighty anthology.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nWhen Leif Edling lay Candlemass to sleep after Volume VI, no precedent existed to suggest that the Swedish epic doomsters would reawaken several times over the years. Turning his hand to other projects, such as the relatively doomy Abstrakt Algebra, Edling\u2019s arm was twisted to return his attention to his most successful project by industry hands in Music for Nations who knew that the Candlemass name alone would guarantee better results for Dactylis Glomerata. Perhaps the incredibly familiar packaging (the same skull appears from the cover of the debut) meant that more records were sold and a few backs were patted, yet every Candlemass fan knows that this is the point where the group\u2019s legacy was besmirched and that the same style of output from the late \u201880s never returned, member changes notwithstanding. This does not sound like a Candlemass album, nor does it sound like a mere tangent \u2013 Dactylis Glomerata is another kind of music entirely.\n\nDue to the recording first being made as an Abstrakt Algebra release, the divergences from the doom metal formula (forget epic doom entirely) can be quite severe, something that guides around half of the songs on the album. One notable factor is that a hefty dose of psychedelia turns up here, which also found its place in supplying the spacey elements of the more coherent follow-up From the 13th Sun. I can see how some people would be able to trace that psychedelic influence back to Hawkwind through Black Sabbath and thus confirm it as part of a doom metal agenda, but feels like a reach when keyboards are often at the ready and \u2018Apathy\u2019 sounds like a secret shrine where Marilyn Manson\u2019s fondness for David Bowie is revealed, along with a taste for Peter Steele\u2019s poetry. Admittedly, \u2018Dustflow\u2019 \u2013 the album\u2019s longest song \u2013 spirals off into dreamy synthesizer twangs as its second half lopes along on a repeating riff, though nothing in the Sabbath canon ever hinted at such an ambition.\n\nBarring the psychedelic elements, other weirdness crops up in the shape of two much quicker and more abrasive songs that share more in common with post-hardcore than doom metal. Conspicuously, one still goes under the name of \u2018Abstrakt Sun\u2019, proving how much Edling\u2019s other project differed from Candlemass: that song sets out its stall with aggressive \u201860s guitar strumming like that found on the debut of 13th Floor Elevators, which transitions through another quiet atmospheric verse to discordant single note riffing that puts me half in mind of Glassjaw. However, the sense of unease that the keyboards generate faintly in the background really skew expectations, as does a decent punky break in the middle, seeing Bj\u00f6rn Flodkvist shouting as the guitars squeal. The closing section of the song picks up on the backing ambience and exits in eerily spacious manner. As such, \u2018Abstrakt Sun\u2019 comprises something totally different from the band and comes across a great deal better than \u2018Lidocain God\u2019, the other fast song on the album and essentially a disjointed part two of \u2018Abstrakt Sun\u2019.\n\nDoom fans terrified that Candlemass entirely missed out on their raison d\u2019\u00eatre for Dactylis Glomerata may not find solace in learning that I find the doom songs much less interesting than the experimental cuts. \u2018Wiz\u2019 constitutes the expected fast-paced opener to the album and finds it adequate to speed up some riffs from Sabbath Bloody Sabbath while pinching Tony Iommi\u2019s solo technique wholesale, yet things really hit bottom rung when \u2018Karthago\u2019 finds even more basic ways in which to rip off Sabbath and couples that with being entirely forgettable. Of greater reassurance is \u2018I Still See the Black\u2019, which forms a stronger link to the staple Candlemass sound of crawling riffing that carries with it a sense of momentum and stateliness. The pick-up of energy after the second chorus corresponds with a solid effort from Flodkvist, not to mention the masterstroke of allowing him to gently intone the pre-chorus over synthesized bells. Unusual, unexpected, and astoundingly effective when the main riff piles back in.\n\nFrom a purely Candlemass perspective, Dactylis Glomerata was rather set up to fail, since it delivers almost nothing that a fan of the band\u2019s earlier work expected or desired. In the bigger picture, however, some of the experiments attempted more or less stuck the landing and prove interesting digressions from the latter day \u201cLeif Edling formula\u201d of solid slow doom with charismatic vocals. Even the kooky little aside \u2018Cylinder\u2019 has me crooking my ear to catch the stripped down sound of an orchestra playing, quite possibly, from an original wax cylinder recording. Therefore, regardless of the sense of impropriety Dactylis Glomerata bestowed upon the Candlemass name, I view it more as the weird cousin of the family than as a knife-wielding intruder - freaky, often ignored and maligned, but part of the family nonetheless.\n",
        "\nIsn't it a wonderful feeling when hype\u00a0actually\u00a0pays off?! Teasing retirement for the past fuck-knows-how-many years, the pioneers of epic doom metal, the legendary Candlemass, have pulled off a 'comeback' of sorts. The EPs that bridged the gap between this album and the last were questionable both in terms of quality and enthusiasm. However, with the announcement of the return of original\u00a0Epicus Doomicus Metallicus\u00a0vocalist Johan\u00a0L\u00e4ngqvist, there came waves of hype - which, as it turns out, were well justified. The guy sang six songs 33 years ago but has somehow retained 'God' status among fans and is frequently hailed as a legend. Well, Leif Edling and crew have decided to come full-circle, bring a 55-year-old Johan back to the frontline and releasing\u00a0The Door To Doom.\u00a0This is the Swedes' 12th full-length record, their first in seven years, and - dare I say this after only 3 listens? - their best in ages.\n\nNow, I don't give in to hype very easily (one of the reasons I've never read\u00a0A Game Of Thrones),\u00a0but I know what I want from my doom metal - and the revitalized Candlemass provide exactly that. Menacing melodies, crawling tempos, a sense of cosmological dread, and - most importantly - huge hulking riffs. Dear sweet Jesus...SO many riffs! Sure, they were pretty big on the last LP (2012's\u00a0Psalms Of The Dead) - especially \"Prophet\" - but here in 2019, 'big' has been inflated to 'colossal'. This became clear as soon as the first single, \"The Omega Circle\", was dropped like a fucking anvil on our stupid faces. That's the sort of weight and gravitas we expect from the 'Mass, and then some! The beastly production quality adds to this tenfold, retaining a sense of rawness whilst beefing up the timbre to monstrous levels. All you need is the majestic first minute of opener \"Splendor Demon Majesty\" to convince you that this is the best sound Candlemass have achieved on disc since 2007.\n\nHonestly, any one of these amazing riffs could attain 'riff of the year' status (\"Black Trinity\" anyone?), but then the great Tony Iommi himself appears on \"Astorolus - The Great Octopus\" so maybe that had something to do with it... Anyway, onto the main talking point, how does Johan fare after a whole three decades in obscurity? Insanely well! He has aged, but more like a fine wine than milk. He croons, mourns, bellows and falsettos with the best of them - providing some real emotional edge and attitude on both ''Astorolus...\" and \"Death's Wheel\" especially. He even manages to improve last year's \"House Of Doom\" by injecting it with some much-needed energy. Guitar solos are well executed and well positioned; drums are a reliable pillar of solid excellence; and the rumbling, metallic bass is - naturally - always fully present.\n\nThe Door To Doom\u00a0exhibits exactly what Candlemass are best at: varying tempos whilst remaining stylistically loyal to the lumbering epic doom vibe. The record is 70% slow and elephantine like a sleeping giant from\u00a0Shadow Of The Colossus,\u00a0and 20% vibrant and energetic for that lethal dose of headbang-worthy fun. The remaining 10% is the beautifully sorrowful ballad \"Bridge Of The Blind\" which splits the album in two, acting as an interval before \"Death's Wheel\" melts your face with Edling's creative riff-writing and\u00a0L\u00e4ngqvist's gruffest performance yet. This album needs to be heard by every metalhead, to remind them who birthed a massive segment of our beloved genre and why they're not just relevant, but a mentor to those following in their footsteps.\u00a0The Door To Doom\u00a0is the best doom metal album I've heard in a long time, and my favourite Candlemass output since 2007's\u00a0King Of The Grey Islands.\u00a0I don't miss Messiah, I don't miss Lowe and I certainly don't miss Leven. I'm only looking forward to a dark, gloomy and doom-laden future.\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Observer\n",
        "\nI might be a rarity here, but when I heard that Candlemass was (again) abandoning their plans to become a live-only band and that they were reuniting with the vocalist who graced their legendary debut, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, I was... pretty much not at all hyped about it. Let's be real here, Johan Langquist was incredible in 1986, but fuck guys it's been 32 years and he's done essentially fuck all since then. He pops up every now and again to join Candlemass onstage but he's only ever sang Epicus songs with them when he does, he auditioned to join the band full time in the early 90s (it's easy to forget he was just a session guy they hired on the debut, though the band loved him back then and wanted him to join for real) and lost the gig to Thomas Vickstrom (and rightly, I should add, I've heard his demo of \"At the Gallows End\" from that era and he butchers it), and apart from his occasional appearances onstage to remind everybody that he sang \"Solitude\", I haven't seen much evidence that he's done a whole lot of singing at all in the decades since then. Forgive me for being cynical, but we are currently neck deep in the era of nostalgia where every metal band that existed from 81-94 is getting the band back together for fests to play shit they wrote in their early twenties, and Leif is a savvy businessman who knows that he can maximize hype for himself by bringing back a nostalgic favorite and attaching it to the only band of his that anybody gives a shit about instead of fully moving on with one of his other projects or finally giving Mats Leven the chance he deserves.\n\nAnd now that The Door to Doom is finally out, I feel somewhat vindicated, because this is exactly as uninspiring and average as I expected.\n\nOne thing I want to get out of the way right away is that Johan does sound very good. I expected him to sound like what he is, a washed up fluke decades past his prime, but I'll eat a small bit of crow here and admit that he sounds excellent here. Even if you totally ignore the surprise at the vigor in his voice for being a session guy who has been out of the scene for three decades, he sounds great on his own. Instead of sounding worn out and lame like I expected, he sounds like any other good epic doom vocalist out there today. He sounds weathered in a way that implies he's an old guard warrior who has put his time in and experienced everything he's singing about. I wish his voice blended with the music a bit better, as he's mixed in such a way where he sounds like he's singing in a completely different studio and slapped on top of the band long after the fact, and his completely dry and reverb-less sheen is distracting in how much louder it is than the rest of the band, but he turns in a great performance nonetheless. He may be lacking the range of previous vocalists, but if Candlemass is good at anything, it's landing iconic vocalists with loads of charisma, and I can safely say that Lanquist truly does deserve to be in the same conversation as Messiah and Lowe on that metric alone. \n\nBut what truly drags the album down is just how workmanlike and uninspired the songs themselves are. Leif has been on autopilot for a while now, basically cycling the same four or five songs on every single album since the reformation in 2004 between all of his projects. He's basically doing what Rolf did with Running Wild, constantly releasing similar albums between several projects and only generating interest with the original band that made him famous in the first place. The difference is that while Toxic Taste and Giant X guided what Running Wild was doing, Candlemass has always been the one leading Krux and The Doomsday Kingdom. What this really means is that Leif has gotten comfortable in his songwriting, and once again we've seen him release something only sort-of inspired and overall triumphantly average. The Door to Doom is functionally identical to Psalms for the Dead or Death Magic Doom, further showcasing that the band really doesn't seem to be able to tap into whatever it was that made them so much larger than life in the classic era. There's no splendor here, instead it's much more down to earth and rocking, which is fine on principle but can be disappointing when the riffs don't do much to excite you. I can name the good parts, it's not hard. The explosive riff on \"Under the Ocean\" absolutely demolishes, \"House of Doom\" has a very \"Crystal Ball\"-esque sense of demonic psychedelia, and \"Astrolus - The Great Octopus\" channels the best of Heaven and Hell's The Devil You Know with it's monolithic pace and heaviness (and no I'm not just making that connection because of Tony Iommi's guest appearance, though it certainly helps). Everything else just kinda... happens. \"Death's Wheel\" and \"Black Trinity\" are total non-songs that contribute absolutely nothing beyond pure banality, \"The Omega Circle\" feels longer than it is and the fadeout two thirds of the way through just feels excessive, \"Bridge of the Blind\" is a pointless quiet bridge that would've worked better if it was only a minute long and treated like an interlude, and \"Splendor Demon Majesty\" opens the album with a quicker pace but fails to grab you in the same way \"If I Ever Die\" or \"Prophet\" did on the previous albums. And then that's it, five of the eight songs are just unnecessary.\n\nThe Devil You Know is a good point of comparison for me, because I was also totally underwhelmed with it on the whole and it's for mostly the same reason. Heaven and Hell didn't utilize the members efficiently and didn't play to Dio's strengths because he's always worked best when there's a sense of magical wonder behind him.  The Door to Doom also plays against Candlemass's strengths by focusing less on the wide-eyed splendor and almost spiritual undercurrent of their classic era, instead focusing purely on heaviness and downtrodden Sabbathisms. The dark psychedelia can work in certain contexts (see \"House of Doom\") but something like \"Bridge of the Blind\" or \"The Omega Circle\" just could've been approached in a different way that better encapsulated what made everybody fall in love with Candlemass in the first place.\n\nOverall I don't necessarily dislike The Door to Doom, but it's a very average album. Not quite mediocre, not quite enjoyable, just... there. If this didn't have the legendary name attached to it, it would likely fly as a flavor of the month joy for doomheads before quickly fading away, and that's just disappointing. Johan's surprisingly great vocals and \"Under the Ocean\" and \"Astrolus\" alone can't carry the album. Maybe it's not fair, but this is just completely unexciting coming from a band that we all know is capable of writing some of the greatest metal albums of all time. I think the hard pill we need to swallow is that the guys simply aren't capable of that anymore. And that's just heartbreaking.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nAs much as I love Candlemass and its affiliated projects, I must admit that my feelings toward the band have somewhat soured in recent years. Leif Edling deserves props for his prolific yet quality releases spanning numerous names, but his \u2018epic doom with operatic vocals formula\u2019 has yielded some frankly interchangeable results in the last decade or so. Being a songwriter myself, I can understand (and am very guilty of) recurring tropes, but it honestly feels like the only difference between Krux, Candlemass, or The Doomsday Kingdom is whoever was available to sing at the time. And even that metric is pretty suspect with guys like Mats Leven showing up as repeat conspirators.\n\nThese feelings only intensified when the details surrounding Candlemass\u2019 twelfth full-length The Door to Doom came to light. Casual and hardcore fans alike rejoiced as renowned vocalist Johan Langquist joined the band full time over thirty years after his sessional debut, and that Tony \u201cFuckin\u201d Iommi himself contributed a guitar solo to a song. The doom world seemed to hope for the second coming of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, while I expected yet another variation of the Leif Edling formula with somebody else singing.\n\nI was right.\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard anything that Candlemass released in the 2000s, then you already know what The Door to Doom sounds like. Any assumptions of Epicus-style labyrinths or Messiah-era grandeur can be left behind in favor of Edling\u2019s now-signature blend of doom, power metal, and psychedelic rock. The structures are elaborate but ultimately straightforward, the riffs are workmanlike yet impactful, and the production paints it all in a heavy, full polish.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the musicianship hasn\u2019t had this much vigor since 2009\u2019s Death Magic Doom. Langquist is nigh unrecognizable with thirty-three years of time and infinitely less reverb on his voice, but his performance is solid with a good mix of melody and grit. It must also be said the drums are lively and the guitars continue to reign supreme. As blasphemous as it sounds, I think Lars Johansson\u2019s solo on \u201cBridge of the Blind\u201d may be more stirring than the Riff Lord\u2019s cameo on \u201cAstorolus.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of which, I won\u2019t deny that there\u2019s some great material on here. \u201cAstoroulus \u2013 The Great Octopus\u201d is easily the album\u2019s best song; even without Iommi\u2019s electrifying solo, its climactic hook and atmospheric menace puts it up with the strongest of the Robert Lowe era. Nothing else quite reaches those mind-blowing levels, but \u201cBridge of the Blind\u201d makes for a poignant ballad, and I can get into the grooves on songs like \u201cDeath\u2019s Wheel\u201d and \u201cBlack Trinity.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes down to it, The Door to Doom is a good album that nobody would\u2019ve cared about if Candlemass had released it without Langquist\u2019s involvement. Such a sentiment speaks more to fair-weather listeners than the album\u2019s actual quality, but it would\u2019ve been great to see a widened scope for such a glorious return. The musicianship is energized and the writing is focused, so I can imagine this being a warmup for something even stronger to come. I definitely said that when the EPs came out, but you\u2019re just gonna have to let me believe it. Doom Dance if you believe!\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cAstorolus \u2013 The Great Octopus\u201d\n\u201cBridge of the Blind\u201d\n\u201cDeath\u2019s Wheel\u201d\n\u201cBlack Trinity\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n",
        "\nSitting here on the Christian holiday of Candlemas, listening to Ancient Dreams, surrounded by lit candles, and drinking the Iron Maiden beer Hallowed: I am feeling pretty in the zone. So I think a review for my favourite Candlemass album is in order.\n\nWhat is it that makes me prefer this album over the monstrously regarded Epicus Doomicus Metalus and Nightfall? I think it comes down to consistent hooks. While Epicus undoubtedly starts out with probably the greatest song that Candlemass ever wrote, and the rest of the album is excellent, I find that my attention can start to wander at times. Even more damning for Nightfall, is that I find myself rather bored throughout most of the album, with the notable exception of \"At The Gallow's End\". But there's something about the tracks on Ancient Dreams that keep me allured and engaged throughout the entire runtime.\n\n\"Mirror Mirror\", while not immediately recognizeable as similar to \"Crystal Ball\" on Epicus, gives me that same feel, only better. In some ways it sounds like a cliche, \"oh, the metal band singing about a magic mirror\" but dayum, they do it well. Marcolin's voice really elevates the topic of the mirror to another plane. And \"A Cry From The Crypt\", holy hell, this might be my favourite Candlemass riff. It literally sounds like a corpse is slowly creeping its way out of the crypt towards you. Ditto for the other riffs too, in that many of them seem to embody the action/vibe of what the song is about.\n\nYes, it's definitely the riffs that make this album stand out to me. Marcolin's operatic voice is amazing, but it's also amazing on Nightfall and Tales Of Creation, so that can't be what elevates this above the others, although it's still an integral part of what makes this outstanding. Most of the lyrics seem to be inspired by Biblical stories, which certainly suits the origin of the band name, and fits the epic sound well. \n\nThe musicianship is solid, and the songwriting is gold. Slow parts that resemble \"Children Of The Grave\" type Black Sabbath, with sporadic bursts of speed bordering on thrash, not too different from early Trouble. Lots of the rhythm guitar tends to be slow and is played with lots of staccato, which gives it a kind of doomy trot, as though a dark figure is slowing shuffling along a castle corridor. Funny enough, the only thing that doesn't work too well on here is the Black Sabbath medley. Not that it's bad, but it belongs on a bonus disc, not tacked onto the end of the album.\n\nAll in all I don't have too much more to say about this album, except that it's great! If you already know what early Candlemass sounds like, but you haven't heard this album, you will most certainly enjoy it. It has that same galloping, pounding, epic doomy trot to it that complements the operatic vocals so well on all their albums. And if you haven't heard any Candlemass yet, here wouldn't be a bad place to start. Heck, any of their first four albums would be a splendid start. Even Nightfall is a good album, I just descend into an illogical boredom with it most of the time. But I always remain engaged during this beauty!\n",
        "\nA peculiar anomaly in the otherwise towering discography of Candlemass, House Of Doom is supposed to be the soundtrack for a mobile game. Yeah, that's right: the Candlemass Mobile Game\u2026 Although I\u2019m not sure how the music would fare in its intended purpose, it didn\u2019t take long to form an opinion of this as a regular EP. For a while, the doom metal veterans were teetering on the brink of retirement, but fans now have a whole new full-length record to look forward to in 2019! What a turnaround! In the meantime, following on from 2016\u2019s Death Thy Lover, we have this 4-track slice of doom metal courtesy of Edling and co.\n\nMusically, this is absolutely nothing special, and exactly what we\u2019d expect from Candlemass. However, whilst this would normally warrant zero complaints from myself, I confess to feeling that there\u2019s something missing. Some unidentifiable X factor that usually gives the Swedes their spark is sorely absent. Sure, the chromatic riffs are there, the lumbering tempos, the mournful melodies\u2026 but one is left feeling strangely unsatisfied by House Of Doom. One thing I can put my finger on is the voice of Mats Leven. He\u2019s not bad, but he possesses none of the charisma of Messiah nor the sweet menace of Robert Lowe. I am quite pleased to hear we\u2019ll have a 'new' vocalist for the upcoming full-length.\n\nThe production quality is a teensy bit muddy here, but that doesn\u2019t affect the overall enjoyment too much. What does surprise is the vibrant tempos at which the two main tracks take off. Both the title-track and \u201cFlowers Of Deception\u201d take on a \u201cChildren Of The Grave\u201d vibe which makes for fun headbanging, but is lacking in the hulking heaviness that \u2018Mass are capable of providing. \u201cFortune Teller\u201d is a nice change of pace and atmosphere, but comes across as more of a folk ballad and doesn\u2019t go anywhere structurally. \u201cDolls On A Wall\u201d has the great doom-laden riffage that we crave, but ends far too soon. A mixed bag from the doom legends this time around, but I\u2019m putting all my money on the upcoming Door To Doom being an absolute slammer. Word has it a certain Johan-something is returning\u2026?\n",
        "\nBack in 2012, \"Psalms for the Dead\" was announced as the final album of Candlemass. How we love these nice promotion gimmicks. Either way, I bought this supposed legacy of the only doom band I really like. Pretty strange, I know why I do not like doom in general - I miss velocity and energy. But honestly speaking, I do not know why I enjoy exactly Candlemass. Well, at least their more modern full-lengths are surely not doom metal in its purest form. \"Dancing in the Temple (Of the Mad Queen Bee)\" almost flirts with pop in view of its very smooth, pretty melodic flow and the radio-friendly playtime. Nevertheless, slow or mid-paced rhythms still prevail and \"energetic\" is definitive no word that comes to my mind when listening to Candlemass songs. This band scores with other features.\n\nRobert Lowe's voice, for example, does definitely not suffer from a lack of charisma. From time to time, he sounds slightly cheesy, not only during the calm verses of \"Waterwitch\". But mostly he celebrates a powerful approach. He manages to appear trustworthy and a little bit demonic at the same time and while doing so, he matches the musical ideas of Leif Edling very well. Speaking of Leif, once again the only composer on this work, his riffs come up to my expectation. This experienced dude seems to have no problems in separating memorable from rather ineffective riffs. Or, second alternative, he writes one and the same riff again and again. Nobody knows it exactly! \"Psalms for the Dead\" has some sections that sound extremely typical for the Swedish authority. That's okay, but this recipe does not work in order to bring another classic to life. Given this situation, the \"farewell album\" cannot compete with the best outputs of Edling's doom machine. Well, that's how it goes if you have released fantastic works in the past.\n\nNonetheless, the songs rely on a stable substance and the technical execution is well done. Candlemass present their relatively dramatic tunes in a voluminous, warm and vigorous sound. The Hammond organ and the keyboards add a seventies feeling occasionally. I am no big friend of this decade, to say the least, but no rule is without exception. Maybe the synthetic solo in \"Siren Song\" is a little bit too much. However, we don't want to be too picky. The spoken intro of the closer is also dubious (\"tick-tock tick-tock...\"), but I guess I am at risk to get lost in details. More generally, Candlemass find the balance between heaviness and melody very well and therefore it does not matter that more or less all songs have the same pace. Of higher relevance is their powerful appearance and their sometimes gloomy or morbid (\"The Sound of Dying Demons\") atmosphere. Unfortunately, it cannot be ignored that the band runs slightly out of breath during the playtime of 50 minutes. The fifth track marks the last highlight. But taken altogether, \"Psalms of the Dead\" marks a decent album - but no worthy legacy. And this is only one reason why it is good to have this band back.\n",
        "\nThe idea behind House of Doom is a rather bizarre one, as the EP is meant to be a soundtrack for a mobile game of the same name (Candlemass mobile phone game, now there\u2019s a phrase I never expected to type). But at its core, Candlemass\u2019s second EP is right in line with 2016\u2019s Death thy Lover. Mats Leven has stuck around to sing over the polished epic doom that Leif Edling has been peddling since the mid-2000s.\n\nWhile this EP\u2019s overall genre is identical to its predecessor, the song styles cover much different territory. The title track and \u201cFlowers of Deception\u201d are largely upbeat tracks with a few dips into doom and a nice psychedelic tangent on the latter. From there, the acoustic balladry of \u201cFortuneteller\u201d makes it the EP\u2019s standout and \u201cDolls on a Wall\u201d is a doomy instrumental closer.\n\nBut even with the twenty-minute runtime in mind, something feels missing on House of Doom. There\u2019s no denying the solid musicianship and writing, but the songs have an almost assembly line feel to them. The hooks on the first two tracks aren\u2019t as impactful as they could be, and while \u201cFortuneteller\u201d makes for an excellent shakeup, it still seems like it could\u2019ve been a bit longer.\n\nWith a new Candlemass full-length album on the horizon (So much for that retirement, right?), House of Doom ends up feeling more like a sampler of what is to come instead of its own entity. Death Thy Lover also had this problem to a similar extent but the songwriting there feels more complete in comparison. I imagine the eight songs between these two EP\u2019s would make for a pretty good album with the right track order in place. Candlemass fans should enjoy the material here but I\u2019m curious to see what these doom masters really have up their sleeves\u2026\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cHouse of Doom\u201d\n\u201cFortuneteller\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n",
        "\nCandlemass was one of those few bands that kind of came out of nowhere, just to send out this beautiful heavenly vibe. I'm not a religious guy by any means, but this experience I got from ''Tales of Creation'' surely was spiritual or something in that direction. I can't say I've ever felt anything close to this from any music before. That feeling itself is so deep and beautiful that you can only really experience it if you listen to this album. I will, of course, do my best to describe it as accurately as possible, but my best recommendation is to FEEL this album all by yourself. Now, this sounds like a good ending of a review, rather than a beginning, but I just had to get that out of my chest. Now let's look at what makes this album such a beautiful piece of art...\n\nThe first thing that will greet you when you put your speakers up to max is this beautiful piece of poetry, just to be accompanied by some heavy and depressive riffs. They call it ''The Prophecy'', a wonderful start to this magical trip. It transfers smoothly to ''Dark Reflections'', a track that will give you the very best of Candlemass. From here and on you will meet Messiah Marcolin, a talented singer with a little different voice than you might have encountered before in metal. His operatic voice really gives this album all the push it needs to go all the way up to a masterpiece and beyond. The next track ''Voices in the Wind'' is another kind of poetry, but this one gives me goosebumps because of its thoughtfulness. I get this feeling, that no matter how many times I've heard it, it still never really gets old. Nevertheless, the next track might be something you're familiar with, namely ''Under the Oak'' from ''Epicus Doomicus Metallicus''. This version is, of course, different in that way that it's no longer Johan L\u00e4ngqvist who is the singer. And I'm quite happy about that because I could never really get into his voice, that voice that would kind of ruin the next track ''Tears'' if he would play on this album, that track is mostly for Messiah, despite all the good riffs and solos, singing is the main feature here. \n\nThat is going to change very quickly when ''Into the Unfathomed Tower'' kicks in. It will deliver the most unexpected turn in the doom metal history with all its solos and fast drumming. I kind of like that they surprised with this, as ''Tales of Creation'' is not only the work of the vocalist. It's teamwork, and here they really show what the rest of the band is capable of as well. But despite its speediness, it won't ruin your deeply constructed feeling of ''heaven and wonder''. No, it will stay the same, but the next track ''The Edge of Heaven'' will even enhance that feeling further, I would go as far as to say, that's probably the most epic song on this album. It's like combining emptiness, sadness, and hopefulness into one and mix it, a very different but genuine feeling. Something that will continue to the rest of the album, but ''Somewhere in Nowhere'' and ''Through the Infinitive Halls of Death'' are more mystical in its nature. \n\nThe story has got to come to an end, and what's so brilliant about this album is that they put this last piece of poetry just before the final track. It will also boost the title track, the last one, with all what is needed to say goodbye. It leaves you here with a feeling of harmony and well being, and so do I...\n",
        "\n\"Chapter VI\" was the first and simultaneously last regular album of Candlemass with Tomas Vikstr\u00f6m on vocals. The successor of the figurehead Messiah Marcolin delivered a good performance while offering a wide spectrum. His clear voice and his classic style give the album its own character. But it is not only the charismatic, accurate voice of Vikstr\u00f6m. The elegant, not very heavy yet somehow fitting sound also lends the album a special colouring. It's a pretty unusual sound, not sticky, although the keyboards play a remarkable role, but very atmospheric. Stylish pictures in the booklet to each and every song complement the production in a suitable manner. No doubt, \"Chapter VI\" profits from a holistic approach.\n\nThe entire output uncovers the melodic side of the Swedish kings of doom. Well, doom? I do not think that real maniacs of this sub genre would call this album a typical doom metal output. Bone-dry riffs and a constantly slow pace do not play a role here. Candlemass prefer a mid-tempo approach and the songs have a smooth flow. No doubt, usually I like to listen to more extreme music, but the relative harmonic presentation is perfectly tailor-made for Vikstr\u00f6m's style of singing. But do not confuse \"harmonic\" with \"commercial\". The fifth studio work with the slightly irritating title (live albums don't count!) is free from mainstream influences.\n\nFor example, the song have an average length of nearly six minutes and their patterns are comprehensible, but not primitive. The album also does not spread mass-compatible vibes, because it evokes a very melancholic, more or less dramatic aura. This sometimes even depressive atmosphere is definitely not the sound the missionaries of the event generation want to hear. Quite the opposite, titles like \"Julie Laughs No More\" reveal an authentic sadness. Even I am depressed, because old, grumpy and lame dudes like me should be the ones who have nothing to laugh about. But pretty girls like Julie should have a good life, at least the one I know... but I digress. \"Julie...\" is one of two tracks which have been co-written by Lars Johansson. (I am surprised, because I always thought that Leif Edling is a despot who does not allow his band members to contribute to the compositions.) In addition, it is among the best tracks of the album in view of its comparatively heavy verses and chorus. However, the output is filled to the brim with very good titles. The bombastic and profound \"Where the Runes Still Speak\" grows constantly. It might be that it has a slightly repetitive configuration, but I like its melody very much and the same applies for some details like the blowing wind in the background. Even its keyboard solo with the seventies vibes pleases me and I forget for a short time that I usually neither like this instrument nor this decade.\n\n\"Temple of the Dead\" with its rather jagged opening riff marks another milestone. It's a great track with a lot of substance, a slight oriental touch and warm yet unpretentious melodies. However, all songs have some interesting elements, even the bonus track deserves this label. I like it that the material expresses wistfulness without neglecting the necessary degree of crispness. Maturity shimmers through every note, but it does not asphyxiate the vitality of the songs. The whole album avoids boring sequences and this is, as we all know, no matter of course. Nevertheless, be aware of the fact that \"Chapter VI\" is very different to the first studio works of the band. This is the \"guilt\" of the production, the less heavy material and the new voice. But I confess that I never had a love affair with the solid records that Candlemass released during their early years - and this might be a reason why I like the modified approach of \"Chapter VI\", despite or precisely because of the style of Tomas Vikstr\u00f6m.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to doom metal, I am anything but an expert. I respect bands like Count Raven or Saint Vitus for their authentic, non-commercial way of proceeding, but their music does not release endorphins in me. Candlemass are different. Perhaps they are no real doom band and I can imagine and partly understand that some maniacs of the sub genre say that they sound lax and infidel. Just listen to the very melodic chorus of the velvet \"Of Stars and Smoke\". I don't care. The Scandinavians have published some truly great albums and \"King of the Grey Islands\" is one of these works.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is a pity that Messiah Marcolin was not involved in this work. Back in the old days, this well-nourished dude seemed to belong to the inventory of the group. But Robert Lowe does not lack charisma as well. As soon as his sonorous voice comes in, he spreads a majestic aura which fits a title like \"Emperor of the Void\" very well. Speaking of this piece, it combines tragic, strictness, heaviness and desperation in a fascinating manner. The song opens the door to the cosmos of Candlemass where the guitars sound like rolling thunder. They pave the way for the very strong compositions that flow smoothly without lacking rough edges. The songs are always comprehensible, but not primitively configured. Main man Leif Edling has forged intensive numbers. Just like so many other Swedish musicians, this guy knows how to pull the listeners into the songs in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe material relies on a comparatively small number of riffs, but these riffs carry the songs safely to their destination. Tempo changes only occur if there is no alternative. In this context it must be mentioned that the drums do not withstand the power of the guitars. A little bit more pressure of the snare and the bass drum would have been nice, nevertheless, the mix does not deserve harsh criticism. It puts the emphasis on the massive guitars and that's absolutely okay. Moreover, it matches with the material which commutes between the pretty swift \"Emperor of the Void\" and the dramatic \"Embracing the Styx\". These songs build, together with tracks like the direct and stoically stomping \"Demonia 6\" or the very typical, slow-moving but somehow explosive \"Devil Seed\", the highlights. Yet I must admit that all eight regular tracks of the normal edition have the potential to become your personal favourite. \n\nAll in all, this album conveys sadness, melancholy and broken dreams. From my point of view, it marks a highlight in the discography of Candlemass. The bonus section does not really add value to the album, but it also does not affect its class in a remarkable manner. Candlemass were in great form in the first years of the 21st century. Therefore, \"King of the Grey Islands\" is almost as good as its phenomenal predecessor and definitely worth listening to. That's not difficult for me to judge, even though I am no doom metal specialist.\n",
        "\nRegardless of what one thinks about Messiah Marcolin, his prodigious vocal talents notwithstanding, it\u2019s undeniable that the moment he left the first time uncertainty was swiftly instilled in the Candlemass camp. It was so big that Leif Edling, the mainman behind the kings of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, decided to change the course of action. Well, it\u2019s debatable whether the vocalist\u2019s departure was the only reason for this decision, but it was a timely one having in mind the scene metamorphosis that was witnessed around the same time.\n\n\u201cChapter VI\u201d saw the guys adopting a more expansive, progressive power/doom metal sound that spawned a wave of similarly-styled works/bands (Pathos, Memory Garden, Veni Domine, Morgana Lefay, Fifth Reason) including the one with Marcolin\u2019s participation, Memento Mori (earlier Hexenhaus). Edling kept riding the crest of said wave with his side-project Abstrakt Algebra which self-titled (1995) could be considered its pinnacle. The man was ready with a material for a sequel to it, but the record company wasn\u2019t happy promoting this new initiative as they wanted more Candlemass exploits. Consequently, this material was released as the next chapter from the Candlemass saga under the title \u201cDactylis Glomerata\u201d. Needless to add, it had very little to do with the vintage sound of the band, and it\u2019s still viewed as the lowest point in their career after all these years. Not a bad effort by any stretch, truth be told, it was followed by \u201cFrom the 13th Sun\u201d, the trippy psychedelic tribute to early Black Sabbath that was way more relevant with its ship-sinking doom-laden character.\n\nAnd that was it; the guys concluded the 90\u2019s with a worthy, but hardly exceptional, opus with no other particular plans in sight for the future. This status lasted for quite a few years until \u201cthe lost son\u201d Marcolin was brought back for the album reviewed here; as a publicity stunt, no more no less, as it became so obvious only too soon. Well, if this was the intention from the beginning then we want more stunts of the kind as this album is one of the ten best releases from the metal circuit since the start of the new millennium. If there ever had to be a true doom metal masterpiece produced in the 00\u2019s, it had to be from the masters\u2026\n\nand the masters deliver, on all counts, with \u201cBlack Dwarf\u201d shattering the aether with its bouncy thrash-prone vigour recalling the aggressive meanderings from \u201cAncient Dreams\u201d, Marcolin soaring above the proceedings with his inimitable wailing, pathos-like tirades. With \u201cSeven Silver Keys\u201d the album enters a sorrowful, doomy mode with slow, officiant rhythms with the customary epic setting nicely instilled, \u201ccloaking\u201d \u201cAssassin of The Light\u201d underneath this cut a more dynamic, but equally as dark proposition with marginally more venomous, more spiteful Marcolin behind the mike. \u201cCopernicus\u201d is a towering progressive metal piece the guys using the more ambitious template introduced on \u201cChapter VI\u201d, expanding it with funereal doomy vistas and superb heavy riffs, this odyssey aptly complemented by the excellent short, elegiac instrumental \u201cThe Man Who Fell from the Sky\u201d. \n\n\u201cWitches\u201d takes the listener on a bumpy, thrilling ride with more intensity and energy incorporated among the seismic riffage and enchanting melodic walkabouts the latter pulled by Lars Yohansson with style to spare, recalling the ones from \u201cMirror, Mirror\u201d (\u201cAncient Dreams\u201d again). \u201cBorn in a Tank\u201d is a formidable galloper again echoing a track from the mentioned album, \u201cA Cry from the Crypt\u201d, the band moshing with reckless abandon as much as this is possible within their chosen field, a nice melodic respite breaking the stride for a bit in the middle. \u201cSpellbreaker\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly break the faster-paced \u201cspell\u201d as it\u2019s built on more lively riff-formulas that border on the gallop at times as well, the band intent on serving their doom in leaps and bounds towards the end although \u201cThe Day and the Night\u201d drowns everything around in gloom and sorrow, an academic 9-min epicer, a model of the genre with the slow-burning dramatism, the patiently-woven configurations, the gorgeous melodic hooks, and last but not least Marcolin\u2019s highly emotional contribution behind the mike. \n\nMentioning the latter, one can\u2019t deny the guy\u2019s indispensable presence and magical touch because with him in action the band are virtually unstoppable. This opus ranks up there with the first four instalments, and one can even go as far as place it above \u201cTales of Creation\u201d even, right next to its spiritual \u201csibling\u201d \u201cAncient Dreams\u201d as both albums are executed in a fairly similar manner. It was a most affirmative, resounding reunion piece of which Judas Priest, whose stint took place the same year, could have only dreamt about. It also raised the lathe too high for subsequent comeback occurrences on the scene, one that was reached by a few (Atheist, Mekong Delta, Black Sabbath, Carcass), but one that ultimately left the majority far behind. It also stirred the dormant doom metal spirits, prompting the band\u2019s main rivals (My Dying Bride, Solitude Aeturnus, Mirror of Deception, etc.) to pull themselves together and perform accordingly.\n\nMarcolin didn\u2019t hang around for very long, but that was to be expected this time around, no tears, no drama; and couldn\u2019t have been any other way with none other than Robert Lowe from the guys\u2019 major rivals Solitude Aeturnus stepping in to fill in the vacated position behind the mike. The band haven\u2019t dropped the ball after this effort here; each subsequent outing has carried some of the magic exhibited on it, keeping them on the top of the doom metal movement, also finally proving that, yes, they can do without the obsequious monk and his prodigious vocal antics. Happy Candlemass everyone!\n",
        "\nThe late-80\u2019s\u2026 the world was speed and thrash (with a healthy shade of death), and if one wanted to survive, they had to adapt to these speedy ways of expression. The US power metal scene nearly disappeared with many of its representatives (Helstar, Nasty Savage, Laaz Rockit, Liege Lord, Attacker, etc.) putting on the thrash \u201cuniform\u201d. Even the epic metal band of all epic metal bands Manilla Road started thrashing like demented on \u201cOut of the Abyss\u201d (simply remember \u201cWhite Chapel\u201d and run all the way to the Moon for cover). For a moment the other battle hymn-behemoths, Manowar, created the illusion that they were turning into a Slayer clone with \u201cWinds of Fire\u201d, the \u201cKings of Metal\u201c opener\u2026 \n\nIn truth, the speed/thrash metal craze was the first indication that the metal brotherhood was open to adaptations, so it wasn\u2019t so surprising after all that many of the 80\u2019s veterans embraced, more or less readily, the groove/aggro/alternative trends that conquered the scene a few years later. Evolution was the name of the game even for the leaders of the doom metal ship, Candlemass. Playing fast and tight within a doom metal context wasn\u2019t exactly a novelty before the album reviewed here: just remember Trouble and their frequent speedy excursions on their early instalments; and Mercy, the band from where Messiah Marcolin came, although the Swedes\u2019 arsenal wasn\u2019t very loosely related to doom in the first place. \n\nFor the Leif Edling gang \u201cflirtations\u201d with the more dynamic ways of expression weren\u2019t the rarest occurrence, either, although they could only be traced to \u201cSorcerer\u2019s Pledge\u201c from the debut, and \u201c\u201dDark are the Veils of Death\u201d from \u201cNightfall\u201d (bits and pieces from \u201cAt the Gallows End\u201d as well). However, here these expressions take the upper hand threatening to tumble the whole doom ship down, but all in a good way. I guess it\u2019s only the kings of doom that can pull it off without sticking to the genre regulations; and not only but also to create their magnum opus. Because in the long run it\u2019s the quality of the music that matters, not some stupid definitions and dogmatic tags restricting the artists\u2019 visions\u2026\n\nI revere each of the first four Candlemass albums in pretty much the same way, but I tend to listen to this album here the most. I don\u2019t know why, I guess it\u2019s the more various manners of execution, its very dark sinister tone, its depressing pessimistic aura\u2026 it\u2019s tough to tell. What sucks in the listener almost immediately is the very thick bass sound; Edling had decided to put himself up front, and the bass literally peels pieces of skin from your body the moment \u201cMirror Mirror\u201d starts. This is arguably the most ship-sinking bass reverberation this side of Geezer Butler\u2019s early feats. It dominates the landscape with such authority that there are moments from the album where it deafens the guitars even. You can hear the glasses and the plates shake in the kitchen if you play the music louder\u2026 it could even shatter the foundations of a small shack; no kidding.\n\nBass burps aside, said opener is a fabulous way to begin this morose saga. It\u2019s hard to categorize this number; it is thrash, is it doom, is it power\u2026 I guess it\u2019s just gorgeous metal Marcolin\u2019s extraordinary vocals bringing all opera singers back to the conservatory with the closing glass-breaking chords. Mournful doom notes inaugurate the arrival of \u201cA Cry from the Crypt\u201d, but what follows is the greatest gallops in the annals of metal, absolutely overwhelming, Russian tank-like, steam-roller guitars that leave no stone unturned during their brooding, intimidating march. This is speed/thrash at its heaviest, most doom-laden form that puts to shame half the functional at the time thrash brotherhood. But that\u2019s not all as at the end we have an extraordinary elegiac, sorrowful doomy epitaph, a bit over a min of pure musical magic; so much for nullifying pleiads of doom metal opuses with just a single stroke\u2026 \n\ndoom metal takes over afterwards, and \u201cDarkness in Paradise\u201d is one of the guys\u2019 most emblematic songs, dark depression in its most shining musical form. Not much brightness on the following \u201cIncarnation of Evil\u201d, another supreme doom metal anthem with a crushing main motif which could pass for thrash if sped up by a notch; Johansson is ravishing with some of the greatest leads unleashed from his arsenal not to mention Marcolin\u2019s impressive, soporific high-strung antics. \u201cBearer of Pain\u201d brings back the more aggressive thrashy riffage which gets mixed with breath-taking balladic sections and hypnotic doomy dirges to a fairly dramatic effect. Prepare for the title-track, doom metal in its purest, most epic shape largely carried by Marcolin\u2019s splendid performance, arguably the crowning achievement in his career. \u201cThe Bells of Acheron\u201d follows suit to bang the heads again with vigorous speed/thrashy rhythms, the most immediate piece here, direct intense riffage without much doomy ado. \u201cEpistle N81\u201d largely compensates for the previous number\u2019s hyper-active stance with grievous soporific tunes bordering on the ballad, but is this one of the saddest songs ever composed, not without Marcolin\u2019s help again who nearly cries on some of the lines; the Funeral March should be re-written with motifs from this cut included to stop casual mourners and passers-by from dancing around the graves like it happens from time to time. \n\n\u201cNightfall\u201d is pretty much the perfect doom metal opus; it didn\u2019t make sense for the band to reproduce it note-by-note for their own gratification. Something had to change, either to inaugurate the funeral doom sector by slowing down to a snail-like rate which wasn\u2019t such an impossible task having in mind that the guys gave such a superb rendition of the Funeral March; or to speed up and impress the audience with their ability to speed/thrash with the finest. They simply settled for the second option, and came up with another masterpiece, an album that didn\u2019t repeat their past exploits and had its individual face, also attracting wider audience in the process. I don\u2019t know a Candlemass fan who had been left disappointed by this album; some were surprised by its faster pace, but such grand music is easy to get into, and man, would this overpowering bass hypnotize you like a serpent, and ensnare you in its iron grip\u2026 \n\none more grandiose opus followed a year later, again with a more characteristic sound, the bass tamed to a large extent for the sake of sharper, still super heavy guitars. Then Marcolin left thus allowing his comrades to explore more flexible vistas with \u201cChapter VI\u201d which gave birth to a large scene of progressive power/doom metal acts (Memento Mori with Marcolin fully operational once again; Abstrakt Algebra, an Edling side-project; Fifth Reason, Memory Garden, Veni Domine, etc.). More metamorphoses followed including another stint with Marcolin (the self-titled, 2005) until the band found their stride again with none other than Robert Lowe (Solitude Aeturnus) behind the mike. The veterans are alive and well in the new millennium, there\u2019s nothing stopping them from conquering Mount Doom again and again, be it with a slow patient stroll, or with an impetuous urgent gallop.\n",
        "\nNot just any band could get away with cover artwork that shows merely the band logo and a tiny plain crucifix on a white background. For most bands, particularly metal bands, that would turn their fans off from buying the album since it seems like there is not much personality to found within and a lack of visual imagery to tie to the music. However, most bands aren't Candlemass. When their debut was released almost 20 years before this album, the image of the horned skull pierced by a cross quickly became representative of the band and has stayed with them throughout a long career. Therefore, when Candlemass fans saw the artwork to this self-titled album, they must have rapidly realized that the minimalism was not a sign of a band with no ideas, but rather of a band so certain of their own identity that there was no need to distract from the essence of the group. In the same way as Metallica's \"black album\", that tiny crucifix was a signal of confidence.\n\nAnd - to hurry quickly to the point - that confidence was not misplaced. Candlemass is a superb album from the Swedish crew, lacking neither trademark identity nor distinguishing features and ensuring that the last album with Messiah Marcolin was one to cherish rather than sigh over. Indeed, the eccentric singer brought a certain something to proceedings here that he hadn't done on his three earlier Candlemass outings, keeping his range in check and opting for power and subtlety instead, leaving the album a mite less dramatic though just as impactful as Nightfall or Tales of Creation. In part, that more controlled performance is down to the other members of the band, who play in a simpler fashion than they did back in the '80s, though also with more focus on power and sheer scale, something that the thunderous production enhances and throws in your face. Seriously, listening to this at high volume is like having an elephant sit on your chest. All this means that the minor power metal elements are stripped from the style (though that was the case as well on the two Bj\u00f6rn Flodkvist-fronted albums that preceded this one), while the \"epic\" doom element is delivered by means of brutish heaviness, widescreen destruction, and the soar and swoop of vocals and lead guitar.\n\nCandlemass gave the first glimpse of the doom metal titans' second successful formula and accompanied the heavier and grittier style with significant steps in the production department, so that Mats Bj\u00f6rkman gets an incredible rhythm guitar tone that flattens itself against the speakers, ably battered into lead sheets by Jan Lindh's pounding drums, and Leif Edling essentially headbutts your ears with his bass work that sticks to his theory of using the instrument as another guitar. As such, the sheer density of the sound is amazing and might make the purchase of the album worthwhile even if all the riffs were shit. Thankfully, they are about as far from shit as the Earth is from the Sun, each song featuring something to get the teeth into. For those weaned on 'The Well of Souls', there may be some crestfallen faces at finding the elegant melodies missing, but doom metal is all about that crestfallen feeling, which the main riffs to 'Spellbreaker' or 'Seven Silver Keys' are certainly going to produce in the best way imaginable. The slow riffs get an immense kick from the instrumental tones and are delivered with such deliberately monumental note progressions that there is really no arguing with them, except a few moments in 'Assassin of the Light' when a brief \"Sabbath, is that you?\" may fill your mind. As with all great doom metal, the slow riffs can make you lose your breath and lose your mind, but are also catchy enough to hum aloud, while the faster songs 'Black Dwarf', 'Witches', and 'Born in a Tank' don't hold back, thrashing about with dangerous amounts of energy that shatter the peace of the other sections. Lars Johansson deserves a quick mention too, since not only has he been a core component of Candlemass since the early days but is probably one of the most underrated guitarists in heavy metal: here, he doesn't have the freedom that he experienced on Tales of Creation, yet each time he peels off a solo it strikes the sweet spot, both in terms of musicality and spine-tingling emotion.\n\nChoosing favourite songs from this album is difficult, so I would prefer to mention the parts that slip slightly in the quality stakes. 'Assassin of the Light', as previously mentioned, has a few parts that don't feel quite so inspired as the rest though doesn't suffer too much; then 'Born in a Tank' is a thoroughly sound arse-kicking yet a little odd for Candlemass in its jumpiness and lyrical sentiments; finally, 'The Day and the Night' is slightly unwieldy in its length and can be blamed for letting attention wander, as with decent instrumental 'The Man Who Fell from the Sky'. All things considered, these are small complaints in the light of the whole album and there is no song that feels like filler or contains significant blunders. Different stylistic elements crop up in different places, from the Black Sabbath vibe of 'Assassin of the Light' to the imperious My Dying Bride riffing in 'Copernicus' to a certain timbre of the vocals in 'The Day and the Night' that reminds me of Maryland doomsters Revelation - there's even a splash of punk influence on the bonus track. For me, the highlights are marginally 'Witches', which deviates a little from the traditional slow structure in a manner that was repeated for 'Demonia 6' on King of the Grey Islands, while 'Spellbreaker' smashes it out of the park in terms of bombastic doom riffing and tangible atmosphere. An additional highlight that might take some explanation were the bizarre YouTube comments that I found on a video of 'Black Dwarf' a few years ago: several viewers had written solemnly below the video \"R.I.P. Gary Coleman\" in - erm - tribute to the diminutive American actor who died in 2010. Don't ever say that doom can't be funny.\n\nSo, Candlemass is a great album, but that tends to be the case with this band, so how does it stack up against their other efforts? Certainly there is a stylistic gap to bridge for listeners more in favour of the earlier incarnation, while I feel that this album concedes a point or two to the nastier successor King of the Grey Islands, the songs on which seemed to link together better as a whole. On the other hand, the songwriting does not fluctuate much between those efforts. There are some parallels between Candlemass and the neglected Chapter VI, a release that profited from a subtler approach and intriguing yet disparate topics, but the modern production here makes it more difficult to ignore when your house is coming down around your ears. Though it sounds strange to write such a sentence, this album confidently seals its status as one of six must-have Candlemass albums.\n",
        "\nThis time last year, it was feared that the most influential doom metal band on Earth were done for. Releasing a 4-track EP now is the perfect way to say \"we're coming back\" to the world. Unfortunately, iconic vocalist Robert Lowe is not present here. His charismatic croons are irreplaceable - and the new addition of Mats Leven is a considerable step down from Lowe's legendary pipes. He reaches neither the grandeur of Lowe, nor the menacing opera of Messiah - but he does the job and the songwriting is more than enough to support his average performance.\n\nOn this EP are 4 brand new songs, each approximately 6 minutes long - giving the listener plenty to get their teeth into and start salivating over. The album artwork is the usual Candlemass fare: skulls, crosses, red-white-black colour scheme. It is familiar imagery, giving nothing away whilst also providing no surprises. Once the melancholy riffage and pondering beats start lumbering away, it all comes together as one glorious whole.\n\nDid I say pondering? I must apologize, as the opening title-track takes things at a rather brisk pace by Candlemass standards. It's a great, energetic way to initiate proceedings - and means that when things get truly doom-y, we're ready for it. The chorus is wonderfully easy to sing along to: \"Death thy lover, in the hollow there's no other!\". A smooth melody and a nodding drumbeat. Overall great Swedish doom track.\n\nHowever, it's the sophomore song \"Sleeping Giant\" that really brings the band to life. The creeping menace that oozes from this track is not just classic Candlemass, but also shows a hint of where the band might go in future releases. Amongst the chromatic riffage, Mats' voice actually sounds more at home here - especially in his admirable mid-range. The production is very good overall. Drums are drenched in reverb and played with precision, and guitars saw through the wall of sound like blades. The bass is disappointing however. During the crawling instrumental \"The Goose\", the bass takes the melody for a while, revealing just how weak it is on this EP. Compare that to the huge, metallic clang of 2007's \"Embracing The Styx\", and it's feeble.\n\nFor what faults it has - you can't ask more from a 4-track EP. Especially from a band as revered as Candlemass. The Swedes have made it clear that they're back on track and ready to unleash more misery upon the world. \"Death Thy Lover\" is indeed both sinister and sweet.\n",
        "\nWith all the projects that Leif Edling has forged in recent years (not to mention his chronic fatigue), it seemed like Candlemass would never venture into the studio again. However, the Swedish doom titans have returned with their first effort since their 2012 \u201cfinale\u201d Psalms For The Dead and their first to feature live singer Mats Leven. The results are solid, even if the intent behind them is tricky to pinpoint.\n\nAs expected, Death Thy Lover\u2018s style has more in common with what Candlemass was doing in the new millennium than anything on Nightfall or Ancient Dreams. The thick guitar tone is right in line with their self-titled album and Leven\u2019s vocal performance has an impish character similar to previous singer Robert Lowe. There is also some subconscious influence from Edling\u2019s other projects; \u201cSinister and Sweet\u201d in particular would\u2019ve fit right in on Avatarium\u2019s last release.\n\nBut even if Edling\u2019s songwriting may result in interchangeable material, it still happens to be pretty damn good. \u201cSleeping Giant\u201d is the best song, riding a steady riff and a playful chorus that doesn\u2019t sacrifice the dark feel. The title track is also pretty solid though the flamboyant chorus and air of finality would probably make it a better closer than the chugging instrumentation of \u201cThe Goose.\u201d\n\nWhile Death Thy Lover feels like it could\u2019ve been released by any of Leif Edling\u2019s bands, it is a reminder of how he releases enjoyable doom under any banner. The riffs are dark and memorable, the vocals are skillfully delivered, and there\u2019s a lot of variety for a four song EP. It\u2019s hard to tell what this will lead to but here\u2019s hoping Leif isn\u2019t going to wear himself out too much\u2026\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cDeath Thy Lover\u201d\n\u201cSleeping Giant\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalshows.com\n",
        "\nWithout 'Nightfall', it's hard to imagine Candlemass having quite the reputation they do. The debut album 'Epicus Doomicus Metallicus' set the template for a new kind of doom metal (epic doom metal if you haven't noticed the title yet) and did away with almost all competitors in the genre, both old and new. However, despite the lofty heights, plodding riffs, and insane melodic parts that 'Epicus' welded together into an enormous doomy whole, there was still more to be done to establish Candlemass as one of the most revered names in slow music and solidify the band's unique style. That's where 'Nightfall' comes in and, a few drawbacks aside, it's surely the most majestic album the group ever made.\n\nFirst up, Candlemass had not solidified as a band when they recorded the debut, so there are numerous line-up differences, Mats Bj\u00f6rkman and Leif Edling being the only familiar faces. This line-up would remain stable for some time, but the first time that Edling, Bj\u00f6rkman, Lars Johansson, and Jan Lindh combined they got it absolutely right, with crushing riffs, spine-tingling melodies, and a rhythm section that transitions between dragging and skipping in an instant. The original production doesn't quite bring all of the power out of the band, though there is still plenty of weight and shine to the songs, plus a vaguely misty iridescence surrounding the instruments. There's a remastered version too, which I've also heard, and would recommend to anyone who is seeking more power and doesn't mind sacrificing an ounce of atmosphere. On the original, the guitar tone is flatter for the rhythm and sparkling for the leads, while the remaster gives a little more juice to both, closer to the final product of 'Tales of Creation', while the drums become crisper (the 1987 snare is a little flat in places). Edling's bass is still audible, though doesn't quite dictate the plays so much as in other Candlemass recordings.\n\nThere's also another new face and whole new haircut to go with it, which of course belongs to everyone's favourite afro-ed monk, Messiah Marcolin. I've noted that there are some other reviews that mention him going overboard on his vocals and leading the band down the road of cheese. On the one hand, anyone with ears can hear Messiah overreaching hmself at the end of 'Samarithan', but then again he is one of the most otherworldly and gifted singers you're ever likely to hear, plus he puts his all into every song, so some oversights are forgiveable. His voice is slightly operatic yet always clear, while he uses his range in a very different way to most 80s metal singers, preferring to stay in his mid-range and stick to actual vocal melodies rather than screeching away at high pitch. That means that his contributions all tend to memorable and, when he does go into the upper registers, it has an electrifying effect, such as how he climaxes the verses in 'The Well of Souls'.\n\n'The Well of Souls' itself is a song that shames almost every metal band on the planet, both from the sheer creativity and complexity of its ideas and in its execution. To get a sense of excitement, an atmosphere of drama, dynamic riffs, catchy guitar and vocal melodies, plus a whole load of shredding into the same song and form one coherent whole is a hard task to pull off once in a career, let alone several times in an album. And, although 'The Well of Souls' is probably the outstanding achievement, none of the six main songs on 'Nightfall' disappoint in the slightest, all proving that ambition and vision do pay off. The slower numbers, 'Mourner's Lament' and 'Samarithan', both have the advantage of possessing great riffs despite their simplicity, as well as an excellent singer (singing interesting lyrics too) to focus on. 'Mourner's Lament' has the edge on its sluggish brethren due to a jaw-dropping solo from Johansson - the repeating parts really hit twice as hard - and a great change of pace as the chorus enters. On the other side of things, 'Dark Are the Veils of Death' has some great faster sections alternating with doomier passages and throws down another killer solo, while 'At the Gallows End' is one of a long line of death row doom songs that has incredible potency and doesn't forget to apply the heavies with music as well as feelings.\n\nIf I have any complaints about 'Nightfall', they are only minor. The production doesn't completely satisfy as I have already mentioned, just muddying the doomier parts a little and not offering the power I would hope for, though I guess there's always the volume knob to solve that issue. Other than that, Messiah's occasional indiscretions mildly tarnish an otherwise superlative performance, while there are also a few parts, like the slow mid-section of 'Dark Are the Veils of Death' or the lead section of 'Bewitched', where the rhythm guitars drop down to simple power chords, something that Candlemass have usually been too good and too creative for. Then, as another minor point, the interludes don't all seem necessary; just one to open and one to close the album would be worthwhile, particularly since 'Bewitched' doesn't seem conclusive as a stand-alone closer. Regardless of these criticisms, 'Nightfall' is a doom metal - and a metal - album of immensely high calibre, with incredible performances across the board and some of the best-written songs in this genre. If you are feeling cheerful, it will make you feel holy; if you are feeling blue, it will make you feel black. It's a total classic and you will certainly understand why from the first time you listen.\n",
        "\n\"Death Magic Doom\"; this three words title is borrowed from Dimmu Borgir, isn't it? The cover artwork is reduced to its essentials and can therefore also not be deemed as a triumph of creativity, although the simple symbolism never fails to have an effect on the beholder. Anyway, the Swedish legend does not need any kind of visual antics. The heavyweight sound of mastermind Leif Edling and his sidekicks speaks for itself. First of all, it goes without saying that I do not need to blather about the musicianship of the five band members. Everything is well implemented, every cog intermeshes perfectly with the next one. In particular the sublime performance of lead vocalist Robert Low is simply impressive. Generally speaking, doom is not my passion, but Candlemass have the ability to fascinate me again and again. Despite its blatantly typical title, \"Death Magic Doom\" marks no exception.\n\nThe album shows new variations of the usual trademarks of Candlemass. A dense and majestic sound is the prerequisite. Its flawlessness lays the groundwork for the dark anthems of the band without killing the dynamic of the songs. Despite the density of the production, the band is always able to intensify the atmosphere of the tracks in a matter of seconds. The instrumental part of \"House of 1000 Voices\" is a good example in this context. Experience how this song progresses between 3:41 and 4:58. To avoid misunderstandings, the entire track is worth listening to. Yet this is nothing special. Each and every song reveals its mightiness, albeit in different ways and to different degrees. \"Hammer of Doom\" is the prototype of a profound and poignant doom song, the mid-paced \"The Bleeding Baroness\" combines heavy verses with a melancholic chorus and the opener \"If I Ever Die\" marks the \"high speed\" track of the album. At this point, I must criticise the band for the arrangement of the running order. Positively expressed, \"If I Ever Die\" stands in the tradition of more or less rapid openers like \"Black Dwarf\" and \"Emperor of the Void\". But, frankly, this beginning is predictable and the entire album lacks a bit of surprising elements. After all, the fairly weird \"Demon of the Deep\" presents an unexpected final part.\n\nIn my personal ranking, \"Death Magic Doom\" stands in the shadow of its two predecessors. But \"Candlemass\" and \"King of the Grey Island\" were true masterpieces and one cannot expect that this quality can be repeated endlessly. The more important thing is that the album is free from lukewarm fillers. Even less impressive numbers like \"Dead Angel\" with its pretty harmless, almost cheesy chorus and its vapid ending have their moments. In the case of this song, the drilling guitars during the verses keep the piece above water. However, the last regular track, \"My Funeral Dreams\", leaves no doubt that Candlemass are not willing to make space for another group at the top of the doom scene. Its dramatic and genuine configuration gives no reason to moan and the strong bonus track closes the loop in view of its relatively fast tempo. A good record, but definitely not the most shining pearl in the discography of the Swedes. Even the fact that the limited edition comes with a bonus DVD does not change this situation.\n",
        "\nEach phase of Candlemass has had its own distinctive feature. For the very first album, it was the feeling of agelessness and infinite possibility that came with the epic sound and the themes of magic and monumental suffering. For the subsequent few albums, it was Messiah and the holy light that the band seemed to emit. For 'Chapter VI', there was a characteristic feeling of weirdness and storytelling, while the next two albums had that spacey, lost vibe that didn't suit the band all that well. The self-titled found itself weightier and with a historic focus, then 'King of the Grey Islands' was a hulking machiavellian misanthrope scheming and swearing in the dark. My problem with 'Death Magic Doom' is that I don't really feel a particular character coming off these eight tracks. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with that - I'm not a sucker for concept albums or anything that too overtly kettles the musical scope of a band - yet I do get the feeling that I've been shortchanged if a Candlemass album fails to deliver something encompassing and overwhelming.\n\nIf I'm going to attempt to pick up a thread or a theme, I do get some images of the vague past (that past that speaks to you of things that have been, though not specifically when) and of single doomed personages who have some story to tell. However, I'm not really sucked into those stories in such a compelling way as I was with 'King of the Grey Islands', which musically resembles 'Death Magic Doom' more than any other Candlemass album. I listen to a song like 'The Bleeding Baroness', feel myself gravitate towards that situation and character, but then the next song throws me somewhere completely different and has to start all over again. Some songs, like 'House of a Thousand Voices' and 'Dead Angel', in fact never grab my attention beyond mere surface features like riffs and rhythms, so - basically - this sour bastard won't let a great band get away with a few lacklustre songs. Maybe that's why they had to call it something as random as 'Death Magic Doom'.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't have so much of a problem with the basic elements of this album, not in the way that I would pick apart Cathedral or My Dying Bride for specific musical issues. The band sound immense in a way that I kind of fail to appreciate nowadays with Candlemass: it's the same cavernous heaviness that dominated all their albums post-2000 and will grind your bones to dust if you so desire. Guitar tone is thick and enormous, plus there's the added bonus of Leif Edling's bass (which he plays here for weight more than anything), not to mention the surprisingly sprightly way in which things can pick up at times, as they do for 'Dead Angel' and 'If I Ever Die'. 'If I Ever Die' is an interesting song in that it deliberately tries to combine the crushing and the frantic: while the band - Robert Lowe in particular - try to out-doom doom itself, the fast riff is a definite treat and shows that the band can mix things up without losing their edge.\n\nIt is on the slower parts of this album that unfortunately Candlemass do begin to lose something, since someone (and it's the same lineup as on the preceding album) had obviously come dangerously close to the end of their inspiration for doom riffs. There's nothing wrong with nicking a few ideas from the legends and doom often sounds better when it's played simply, but, my word, doesn't 'Hammer of Doom' sound just a tad like 'Black Sabbath'? That almost-clean scale picked out over the shuffle of drums, then a surge of momentum towards the close of the song? Needless to say, it goes on a little long and doesn't benefit by the comparison. Then there are some rather simple riffs on 'House of a Thousand Voices', which doesn't quite come off, and we're looking down the barrel at a rather mediocre collection of great-sounding songs. Naturally, there are a couple which should blow away most other half-decent doom bands, of which my favourites are the two closers, which crank up the emotional intensity, plus 'The Bleeding Baroness'.\n\nIn the end, we do have here a slightly disappointing Candlemass album, not only because there aren't any songs that scream out \"classic\", but also because no one's performance stands out enough. The lead guitar is still good and swoops and sings dramatically (the solo in 'Clouds of Dementia' is gobsmacking), yet its use in the songs is more an extra part than an intrinsic role. These songs just never seem to arrive in the way that I have known from these five men. Robert Lowe is also disappointing, not reaching his absolute best and over-reaching himself on the all-or-nothing 'If I Ever Die'. 'Psalms for the Dead', which followed three years in the wake of 'Death Magic Doom', suffered a similar fate, and both end up as decent albums, though exist as an indicator that the end was at hand for the mighty Candlemass.\n",
        "\nUsually, I associate heavy metal with volume and aggression, harshness and velocity. These are the features why I like this music. Doom metal has its right of existence, no doubt about it. It just does not belong to my favourite styles. The discovery of slowness does not make my day. It is a rather boring matter, at least in my view. Yet there is no rule without exceptions and the doom genre does not leave me completely cold. That\u00b4s the point where Candlemass come into play. Their albums never fell below a solid level. Even rather crude outputs like \"Dactylis Glomerata\" or \"From the 13th Sun\" have their moments. However, the masterpiece of the Swedish legend is definitely their self-titled full-length. Their first albums may have gained cult status in the eyes of some beholders, but the musical content of \"Candlemass\" is more or less unbeatable, among other things because of the vocals. This is where Messiah Marcolin comes in. His full voice creates dramatic, aggressive and desperate moments, depending on the needs of the respective song. Maybe he is an eccentric and insufferable egomaniac, but his vocals on \"Candlemass\" leave nothing to be desired. Too bad that this full-length became the farewell performance of this charismatic monk at the microphone.\n\nBecause of being no expert for this genre, I am unsure whether the album delivers pure doom. Some melody lines have a certain pop appeal. I suspect that real doom metal fans may have problems to get used to the here presented approach. Candlemass do not eschew to perform relatively cheesy lines (for example, the soft chorus of \"Seven Silver Keys\") and they are thankfully not totally immune against comparatively fast rhythms (\"Black Dwarf\" and \"Born in a Tank\"). But the band also scores with heavyweight riffs and ironclad harmonies that benefit from the warm and vigorous production. Highlights such as \"Assassins of the Light\" and \"Copernicus\" have to be mentioned in this context. However, the crucial thing is that almost every single piece deserves the highest praise due to the maturity of the song-writing. Mastermind Leif Edlund has composed songs that lie in very close proximity to perfection. The overdose of epic, elegiac and woeful riffs is admirable. Even the relatively brief instrumental \"The Man Who Fell from the Sky\" impresses me. It is actually a very simple number, but its stoic yet merciless riffs have a huge impact. The strong and metallic sound makes sure that the guitar work does not fail to have the desired effect. The riffs generate an unreal atmosphere so that the falling man is taking shape before the inner eye of the listener. \n\nUnfortunately, the stylishly packed album narrowly misses the full score. \"Witches\" cannot be blamed as a letdown, but it tastes like a slightly stale Swedish light beer. Ironically, another minor flaw is the bonus track. When does mankind get rid of so-called bonus tracks that cannot compete with the regular songs? The here presented last number contains some good basic ideas, but not only due to its sudden ending, it leaves a semi-finished impression. Its noticeable lack of substance cannot be kept hidden. My enthusiasm for these two songs has therefore waned over the years. However, the mediocre pieces only represent a pitiful minority. \"Candlemass\" has become engraved in my mind as a poignant album that shines with both the necessary variance and the emotional force. A lot of its songs rest safely at the highest tier of doom and no change is in sight.\n",
        "\nWhen I think of Candlemass, my mind doesn't jump automatically to this album. It sounds atypical for the revered doomsters and in fact gives their general aesthetic an entire 180 spin that makes me reel a little. However, there is every reason to argue that 'From the 13th Sun' should not be considered as a true Candlemass album: firstly, the only member of the band that many will recognise is the mastermind and bass player Leif Edling; secondly, the vast, towering riffs and stratospheric vocals are traded in for spacey, stoned jams; thirdly, the whole presentation of the album is a far cry from the usual style, with even the band's distinctive logo absent. That said, on its own merits, 'From the 13th Sun' actually has a little less to stand on than if we consider it a surprise divergence from Candlemass's previous path.\n\nThe first thing that will hit you about this is that we are on a trip through outer space. 'Nightfall' and 'Tales of Creation' had dealt with death and the heavens with ample scope, but this is a haunting crawl through the recesses of the galaxy, with its own atmosphere of drifting helplessly as space debris passes by. There are absolutely zero histrionics or attempts to reach a higher plane of understanding, the music cut back to its primal parts, including the subtraction of solos, melodies, and dramatic vocals for the majority of the album. There is even some feedback and electronic effects on songs like 'Blumma Apt' and 'Arx/Ng 891', which would have been unthinkable with the original lineup. Songs develop through repetition and variation, usually maintaining a groove or motif for their entire length and simply dropping the guitars or changing pace to signify the beginning or ending of a section. As such, there is very little technicality left in the playing and the music is left to be judged on catchiness, atmosphere, and its pure heaviness.\n\nFor heaviness, 'From the 13th Sun' is undeniably a success. The guitar tone and bass tone are both absolutely immense, creating a massively wide and in fact spreading boom that feels like meteor impacts or the unhaltable progress of cosmic objects. If the riffs are simple, this at least gives the band something to get behind and put everything into, because this sounds more thoroughly doomed than the band's early shining heraldry, with a bleaker outlook and more destructive tendencies. The drums must by necessity hide behind that tone a little, though they don't exactly cower, battering more sportively than usual and contributing to both the immense heaviness and the lonely drifting parts with equal skill. As for the vocals, Bj\u00f6rn Flodkvist suits this style so much better than Messiah would have done, yet - as has been mentioned in the other reviews - he sounds merely standard, doing nothing exciting or atmospheric, in fact playing his role like another rhythm instrument aiming only to cling to his band like the final frontier of humanity.\n\nWhile these changes all sound fairly good on the surface, the place where they begin to show shortcomings is in the limited range of options they leave for songwriting. Because the riffs are usually simple, slow, and narcotically repetitive, they can't give a song a very specific character; because there are few solos or lead roles (a guitar solo on 'Arx/Ng 891', a bass solo on 'Zog', and a drum solo on 'Cyclo-F'), the music stays at a constant level for a long time and doesn't have much detail; because of the passive singer, there are almost no vocal hooks to keep the songs in your mind. The album thus achieves its intention of sounding like a cold and lonely drift through deserted space, but that experience - however atmospheric it might be - wouldn't be memorable, and nor is this album. There are some change-ups, like the quiet and fragile verses of 'Tot' and 'Galatea', which sound gorgeous when contrasted to the surrounding heaviness, except they don't change the rhythm or the mood of the music and so don't quite have the effect they need - that of making the album more interesting. I listen to 'Droid' and 'Arx/Ng 891' with most interest, since the former has the best groove of the album and an almost nostalgic chorus, while the latter injects a basic melody and a fitting guitar solo into the flattening riffs, which makes it more palatable, if not actually better, than the other offerings.\n\nI understand perfectly why Candlemass decided to make this album and why it turned out as it did. It's a great idea to make a doom album about the futility and epic scale of outer space, even though the execution of that concept turns out to prove that it's probably quite a boring thing to do. The atmosphere is consistent, the grooves are huge, if unspectacular, and there's an ongoing dynamic to the journey that may satisfy some, especially those with a partiality for stoner riffing and contemplative, unobtrusive music. For me, however, this doesn't quite cut it.\n",
        "\nIf one chooses to make a concept album about the creation of the world, there are two ways to do so. One is the way taken by a band like The Ocean or Monolithe (it's the creation of the universe in their case), who both opt for serious and slow earthly and cosmic explorations of the theme. The other option is the one that Candlemass take. I can't imagine Leif Edling making an earthy album about anything, not even chopping potatoes, so it comes as no surprise that this is the most overblown album on this concept, though one that manages to avoid several well-worn cliches and ends up an accessible and thrilling listen. I think that the concept doesn't interfere with any of the enjoyment on offer, unless you count those very short narrative fragments that take up about a minute of the album in total. The sum total of the songs and the surprising compactness of the experience (an epic album only just exceeding 40 minutes) more than outweighs the slight deviation of those parts.\n\nThe first thing to make you sit up and take notice is the absolutely crushing guitar tone that hits you like a handful of gravel to the face and a concrete boot in the nuts the moment 'The Prophecy' opens up. There was no precedent for this on any other Candlemass album before, what with the weak tone on 'Nightfall' and the dryness of 'Ancient Dreams', nor have the band ever repeated the miracle that is the rhythm tone. It's crunchy and doomy, sounds superbly in your face and vaguely reverent at the same time, plus it works very well at pace, which 'Dark Reflections', 'Through the Infinitive Halls of Death', and 'Into the Unfathomed Tower' demand. The whole band sounds enormous as well, as if they are recording in the vault of Heaven or a cave under the sea, and harnessing all the primal power that flows from their location. The drums bite and thunder, Edling's bass swings menacingly beneath the guitar torrent, Lars Johansson shreds and wails like a holy choir, and Messiah does exactly what is required - believes that he is God and never wavers in his belief. Some songs on previous Candlemass albums suffered from his overblown delivery (we're all thinking of 'Samaritan', I know), but an album like 'Tales of Creation' demands that he reach for the limits of his ability, and he does not disappoint, picking off the slower songs with easy finesse, while he supplies an airy melody for 'Dark Reflections' that stands out among his contributions to this band.\n\nThe significant detail that separates this album from 'Ancient Dreams' for me (and I thought that was a fine album) is that the surprises sound so fresh and bursting with energy. Maybe it's the production, but the double bass shredfest 'Into the Unfathomed Tower' that explodes between the slower 'Tears' and 'The Edge of Heaven' is a swaggering statement that declares, \"If Candlemass had been a power metal band, we would have been the best at that too\". It's utterly brutal and fantastic for an instrumental, plus it injects a sense of fun into the album that might otherwise render it slightly po-faced. The sheer irreverence of slapping a 7 part, 3 minute song into a concept album about the creation of the world...words fail me. Then 'Tears' itself is nothing to sniff at, though it strips the riff approach back to a very simple level and skips off a gorgeous time change into an unexpectedly exuberant chorus that Messiah utterly owns. 'Under the Oak', 'The Edge of Heaven', and 'A Tale of Creation' are the full-fat doom epics that the band were always so brilliant at, the last of which has an irresistible surge of emotion as Messiah leads into the (pre?) chorus of \"With my tears the rain fell down\". I also find it a refreshing take on an oft-repeated subject, from a different perspective, and with the typical weight-of-the-world-and-soul-of-God Candlemass style closing the song as Johansson embellishes the same riff that opened the album to bring us back full circle.\n\nAs usual with this band, I can't make up my mind if I have complaints or if I'm just nit-picking. There's nothing particularly wrong with 'Somewhere in Nowhere', which goes darker and more trudging than anything else, though it ends up a bit repetitive, maybe causing the band to cut it short after two choruses. 'Under the Oak' is a great song, but it was already a great song on 'Epicus Doomicus Metallicus', so there might be some fans who feel slightly cheated by the inclusion of a reworked number. I don't mind too much, since tt fits the album well, there are some subtle changes, and Messiah gets to record his take on the vocals, plus it forms an integral part of the concept. That aside, there's not really anything that bothers me, since all the performances are right up there, especially the lead guitar work. Maybe I would suggest that the band could use a font in the lyrics booklet that can actually be read, but now I know I'm nit-picking.\n\nOf all the four classic 80s albums, this Candlemass offering seems to be the most organised and polished. The production is flawless, every song has a part to play, each of the musicians contributes something special, and the atmosphere occasionally takes your breath away. Something happened around the turn of the decade that changed the general aesthetic of Candlemass and, while they would continue to make great music, the sense of peeling back the mysteries of the world and looking directly at its meaning would be lost forever.\n",
        "\nHaving this as my first Candlemass album had a lot of advantages. Perhaps if I had heard 'Nightfall' or 'Tales of Creation', I would have been disappointed with the rather broad guitar tone, which sounds like a concrete/treacle hybrid, or the notable straightforwardness of the solos (no 'Into the Unfathomed Tower' here), or even Robert Lowe's voice, which doesn't quite do the same things as Messiah's. Having since caught up on what I had missed out, I can say that 'King of the Grey Islands' isn't quite as inspirational or as grandiose as those first four albums (not much is), but it's a definite improvement on the very unspectacular 'From the 13th Sun' that I found so plain and dry for this band. Candlemass generally struggled to find a particular direction after their reformation, with some attempts at a more Sabbathy sound, a more spacey direction, and then a darker, less spiritual style on this and the following 'Death Magic Doom' that actually harks back to the slightly mysterious and medieval atmosphere of the debut.\n\nFor me, this is easily the best 21st century Candlemass album and it's a simple matter of numbers. Eight full-length songs, as well as two intros,and all of them are good songs. I would go as far as to say that three or four of them are damn good songs, up there with the best this band has produced, although for sheer jaw-dropping ambition they lag a little behind. What is brilliant about this album is that Candlemass managed to introduce a smidgen of subtlety to their earlier bombastic formula and, by remembering what made them initially so outstanding, produced an album with far greater impact than any of the other post-reformation efforts. Thomas Vikstrom and Bjorn Flodkvist were not vocalists that helped Candlemass achieve their full potential: neither of them were epic doom vocalists and they just made the band sound like a depressed or tripping Black Sabbath. What does the trick on 'King of the Grey Islands' is not a return to the complexity of songs like 'Well of Souls' or the revelatory glory of 'Darkness in Paradise', but instead a strong set of basic ideas with some interesting twists and clear focal points.\n\nRobert Lowe is very important on this album, despite my belief that his best singing days were with Solitude Aeturnus in the 90s. He stretches his voice to far more shapes than all Candlemass vocalists bar Messiah, yet he doesn't give in to the excess that Messiah was constantly on the verge of, instead supplying a very earthy, gritty persona to lyrics that are vitriolic and vengeful in place of lamenting or heavenly. Something Machiavellian seems to haunt the album and, particularly with the curious magic/castle/madness hybrid on 'Demonia 6', harks back to a song like 'A Sorceror's Pledge' and all the epic and mildly fantastic imagery that existed there. Something quite nasty and shadowy goes on in the middle of the album that we don't get a clear glimpse of, though it pulls the listener into an atmosphere and a story that Messiah could never have pulled off. This isn't a concept album, but all the pieces hang together so well that it could be passed off as such - perhaps the epic journey of a ruler turned over to the dark side, who eventually perishes in just the place he used to rule, as the dreamily perfect closing minute of 'Embracing the Styx' suggests.\n\nThe rest of Candlemass are brilliant as well, because they make the most of every musical idea that they begin. The riffs in songs like 'Devil Seed' or 'Destroyer' are very, very simple for this style, but the guitar tone is so crushing and thick that even chord progressions sound immense, while the small melodic touches that unfold upon those riffs are emotional in their gradual ascent and totally seal the climax of 'Destroyer' with their slow harmonic development. The weird structure of 'Man of Shadows' shows how the instrumentalists have out-thought their weaknesses: instead of hoping that pure strength will carry the song, there is the surprise factor of a sudden acoustic verse, which bursts into a squalling solo with all manner of distorted trickery, and a peaceful outro that gets epic because of its balance, not because of any virtuoso playing. On the other hand, 'Of Stars and Smoke' is straight up verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-solo-chorus and is perfect, the kind of song you would have played at your funeral. I could honestly pick out brilliant features from every song and there would still be surprises to spare - the songwriting is just that sweet.\n\nI think that this might just be the smartest album Candlemass ever made. It would be impossible to rise above the 80s albums in terms of musicianship, epic scale, or raw talent, so the wiser heads of middle age went with what they had and used it to its full. Heavier, angrier, more cohesive, and without any weak points, 'King of the Grey Islands' goes right up there with the classics.\n",
        "\nDeath Magic Doom has all the defining facets of a good doom record. This album features vocalist Robert Lowe from Solitude Aeturnus during his six year reign as front man for Candlemass. This is the only album I've heard from him on Candlemass but have heard some of his work from Solitude. I consider his style to be reminiscent of Ronnie James Dio which is definitely not a bad thing! Word pronunciation is concise and vocal range is expansive. His level of \u201ccheesiness\u201d is on par for the image this band portrays. This is the first Candlemass album I ever purchased on vinyl and ever listened to so I had no prior knowledge of their sound or the band's history.\n\nPicking up the LP, the artwork is simple but compelling. Interesting texture choice and it definitely gives off an evil, intriguing vibe. In regards to the writing, the lyrics are fairly typical for a doom album but well written just the same. Mostly religious and dark fantasy from the tracks and they all seem to mesh appropriately. The instruments are where this album really shines for me. Guitar riffs are top notch and evil sounding and the natural drum tone is pretty awesome. Nothing real crazy on guitar solos but what do you expect from a doom album? Simplicity is key sometimes and the solos are very well written and do exactly what they should do for the mood they want to portray on these tracks. Don't really hear that many distinct bass lines going on but the music does seem balanced. Intricate bass lines are another trait that most doom albums don't possess.\n\nRobert Lowe's vocals are fitting for the music style and lyricism from Leif Edling. I listened to some of the band's previous records while diving into this review and it seems he was a perfect fit for their direction. I noticed that Lowe's current stomping grounds are about twenty miles from my home! Anyway, Lowe does a good job of putting out that evil, thick vibe to the tracks on this album. All of his range is executed well and he creates some seriously chilling moments in some breaks and bridges! For the production and quality of recording, I have nothing negative to say. All the tracks sound clear and polished. This isn't the band's first rodeo so I'm sure they have tracking and quality down by now.\n\nOne of the many reasons I listen to metal is to unwind and relieve some stress. This album does that by creating heavy, dark emotions with the combination of lyrics, music, vocals. The term \u201cepic doom metal\u201d makes so much sense after listening to this record. \u201cHammer of Doom\u201d ended up being my favorite due to how heavy some of the guitar riffs were! The only con I can give this LP is \u201cDead Angel\u201d. Like I said before, the lyrics pair really well but for some reason this song sticks out like a sore thumb music wise. Doom fans rejoice because this is a record you should definitely pick up! Non-doom fans: I recommend you give this one a shot and tell me this won't make you a fan!\n",
        "\nNoticing how Candlemass never left us down with their debut full length, they gave us 'Nightfall', surely a spectacular creation. I agree too, Candlemass is a special case in which it does manage to spread sorrow with the dark ambience portrayed in the several instrumentals crafted within this album. I agree too this was something hard to achieve back in 1987. It's all mixed perfectly with a fine production, although the latter doesn't affect the percentage I give to this album. Paired with Solitude Aeternus, these two bands conform what epic doom metal basically is. \n\nThis is also my favorite band and and hopefully I won't appear too much of fanboy on this one. From the bowels of Sweden, Candlemass sets on the table what is arguably the best epic doom metal album out there, if not the best DOOM metal album in existence. And we\u00b4ll get into that now:\n\nRipping up with an instrumental to open 'The Well of Souls', the song itself has the dark and evil atmosphere we all appreciate in a doom metal album. Messiah did a great job pairing his vocals to the rhythm of all songs, making him an interesting and notable element of the band. Not to forget the true mastermind of the band; Leif's dark Christian lyrics shape this as epic doom metal, along Messiah, of course. 'Mourners Lament' and 'Bewitched' are the songs that truly show off Lars' skills when it comes to guitar solos, kicking off real dramatic and glorious ones in each of these songs. Then the album closes with a nice gothic instrumental as nice farewell to the masterpiece.\n\nHaving this said, I reckon this work has no flaw whatsoever and makes for a great standout among the plethora of doom metal albums available. I also must say that this is the start of Candlemass' best era, with Messiah being their most remarkable vocalist their career ever knew and Leif Edling's best lyrics ever written. From this to 'Tales of Creation', Candlemass overrode onto a memorable journey appreciated by all of us, judging by the critical acclaim guarded within the archives. Surely, this work will accompany us through the next 20 years.\n",
        "\nThere are some records that, from the very first note, take you away from the world in which you sit and whisk you away on a journey or to another realm. Candlemass are a glorious band for that reason. Their music forces such a distinct departure from normality, particularly on this first album, that it's easy to forget just how good they sound until you do the service of listening to the whole thing in full. The moment the first notes of 'Solitude' ring out (and 'Solitude' is my least favourite song on this album), I am gone from my bedroom or my car or the street: I'm at the top of a stone tower in an ancient castle, looking out of the window at the swathe of forest beneath me, the mountains in the distance, and the river that bridges the gap between them.\n\nI guess that's why Candlemass get to be \"epic\" doom metal and not just doom metal - they have the vision, the ambition, and the execution never to sound ordinary. Every part of this album is crafted to ramp up the epic factor of the music. If Candlemass can make something bigger, they will. For instance, it's not ever just a riff, it's a riff taken from that basic 'Electric Funeral'/'Iron Man' template, driven over by a steamroller, soaked in lead, blasted in the fire, and given its own sinister embellishments; and then, it's never just that riff, but that riff played with morbid intensity and with a catholic choir of twin guitars; even then, that would be forgetting the vocals that soar above them. This is not doom metal, it's epic doom metal, the enormity of which provides hope, even if it chooses to ultimately dash that hope.\n\nThe first Candlemass album is unique for a few reasons. Firstly, there isn't a song you would want to change. We really do have 6 of the best here, and without any of the annoying interludes that blocked up Nightfall. The songwriting isn't too complicated and it's not too simple: there are a few sections of lighter variation on 'Solitude' and 'A Sorceror's Pledge' that become incredible sing along moments, there are rare faster moments like the pounding double bass riff in 'Demon's Gate' and some of the solo sections, and there are a couple of more complex touches, such as the first verse of 'Crystal Ball', which is apparently a mistake caused by the band getting confused over its timing. It's very rare to hear an album that feels so comfortably natural, so I can only assume that these songs achieved their structural perfection from the long gestation period that Candlemass went through before this album was released. A single listen to the heartbreakingly perfect 'A Sorceror's Pledge', which doesn't need a solo and uses just one main riff, is enough to convince anyone that this album could not have been finessed any more.\n\nSecondly, Johan L\u00e4ngquist sings on Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. He wasn't officially the Candlemass vocalist at the time, but my god does he do a good job. Messiah Marcolin would become the iconic frontman and he brought a greater grandeur to the band than L\u00e4ngquist was capable of, though L\u00e4ngquist sounds like he is living the songs more, despite not being the superior talent. His performance on 'Under the Oak' is mesmerising and the visceral scream that he rips out as the fast solo begins gives me goosebumps every time I hear it - something that Messiah's version (the band rerecorded the song for Tales of Creation) doesn't quite achieve, its lofty brilliance aside. On a similar note, Klas Bergwall was a session lead guitarist for this album and also suffers from having a fantastic replacement, but I have never heard a lead tone like his, with its shrill, screaming iridescence cutting through the rumbling riffs and providing excitement, rather than elevation, as the later style would introduce.\n\nThirdly, I can count 3 songs which have definitively acknowledged, stone-cold classic riffs (the first 2 cuts and the last) and I would like to add 'Black Stone Wielder' to that list, nor would I begrudge the other 2 sneaking on. If the songwriting is great, the compartmentalisation of these songs does not suffer at all for it. Doom metal needs crushing riffs and Candlemass delivers main riffs where there ought to be \"verse riffs\" (code for no fucking riffs at all) at every opportunity. I can't fault Mats Bj\u00f6rkman on here, everything he touches turns to soild lead and his guitar tone is phenomenally powerful. Some respect must go to Leif Edling for his innovative idea of playing bass like a second guitar (and then using a second guitar anyway, ahahahaha), but he gets way more than the minimum number of bass variations in there, mostly playing around the riffs rather than compromising their heaviness. Mats Ekstr\u00f6m is super too and doesn't suffer from boring doom drummer syndrome, playing his fills with glee and keeping things interesting with his faster speeds on 'Demon's Gate' and 'Crystal Ball'.\n\nIf you want to listen to an iconic album, you can't choose better than Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, since it has a title that named a genre, a cover image that defines a band, and 6 songs that cast a spell over the listener and make the real world seem insignificant. \"Time stands still in these ancient halls\", indeed.\n",
        "\nThe pioneers of doom metal released this a while back and it is supposed to be their last studio album. After this they will officially split up taking a well deserved retirement after 30 years on the road. 30 years! Wow! But as we all know it is very hard to get a fix on \u201clast albums\u201d as far great musicians are concerned. Somehow they have the tendency to pop up again in the near future. Anyway, that\u2019s another matter. \n\nPsalms of the dead continues Candlemass\u2019 traditional formula of doom metal. Anyone familiar with their old discography would notice that straightaway. Why fix something if it ain\u2019t broke? But having said that, the album sometimes feels a little drawn out. Starting out with the opener; \u2018Prophet\u2019, probably the best song on the album races off to a fast start. The band continuously slows down things to a doomy crawl in the \u2018Sound of Dying Demons\u2019 and \u2018Water Witch\u2019. But then again they inject some speed accompanied by their trademark epic doom style in songs like \u2018Dancing in the Temple\u2019, \u2018Siren Song\u2019, \u2018The Lights of the Thebe\u2019 and \u2018Psalms for the Dead\u2019. Another feature that doesn\u2019t go unnoticed are similarities to Black Sabbath\u2019s \u2018Iron Man\u2019 in the intro drum part of \u2018The Sound of Dying Demons\u2019 and, the riffs in \u2018The Killing of the Sun\u2019. It must be a tribute to Sabbath, right? Another two traits in the album are in the form of tasty wah wah solos in \u2018Psalms for the Dead\u2019 and \u2018Black as Time\u2019 and a heavy organ usage in almost all the songs (looks like some Deep Purple has crept in!!). \n\nSummarizing, the only gripe that I have is that the slow songs seem a little stretched. Other than that, it\u2019s the same old offering from Candlemass. Note that it took me quite a few listens to get a hold of the pattern. For Candlemass fans you know what to expect. Not great, but a very good doom metal album.\n",
        "\nCandlemass' debut album \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus\" is seen by many as THE doom metal album, the one that one has to hear at least once in their lifetime if they are in fact a fan of the genre at all. Now let me say that I love \"Epicus...\" as much as anyone. I think that it was an ambitious and beautifully bleak record that kept me invested from start to finish and that I still play my copy requarely. Now while the album was undoubtedly great and its hype is justifiable, I am reluctant to declare it the \"greatest doom metal album of all time\". No I believe that Candlemass' second release \"Nightfall\" is a bit more deserving of that title as it not only improves and one-ups everything that \"Epicus...\" first displayed, it also is the album to introduce Messiah on vocals and put the band on the map.\n\nGenerally speaking, Candlemass' sound is woven through a slow paced mix of thick, meaty guitars, bombastic drumming, borderline operatic vocals and an overall dark and somber tone. This album's sound is accompanied by lyrics focussing on themes of religion, death, occultism, mourning and dark fantasy. Now as I said, in a lot of ways \"Epicus...\" first did this, but \"Nightfall\" improves it to a higher degree. Musiaclly the biggest difference is obviously the vocals. Johan L\u00e4ngquist was the main vocalist for \"Epicus...\" but did not stick around afterwards. After this the band went on the hunt for a new singer and Messiah, after relentless hounding to be given an audition was finally heard and recruited by Leif and company for the band, making his first debut here. To me this is an improvement. While some may disagree with me, I think that L\u00e4ngquist, while had a good sounding voice, went a little overboard in performance on the debut. While his voice had a genuine sorrowful vibe, it was a bit exaturated and at times, his highs were a bit too over the top. Mesiah has a much more powerful approach, in comparisons to Johan, putting out this high vibrato that sounds massive, almost operatic a lot of the time, and immediately comands the listener's attention. Where as Johan (in my opinion) had a tendency at times to sound flat or a bit exaturated, Messiah's voice is much tighter and a bit more passionate.\n\nAnd the instrumental work on this album is just as powerful as the vocal performance. The guitar work is immensely heavy and thick, just pumping out one beefy riff after another coupled with some really memorable guitar solos that are catchy, melodic and above all crushing coupled with some massive and bombastic drum work on the part of Jan Lindh. All the performances all sound very tight and passionate, considerably more confident and refined than the debut as everything blends together greatly and is executed very seamlessly. Which brings me to Leif Edling who seems to have a natural talent for composing good music as each song is put together very well and succeeds in painting a very dark, brooding and gloomy atmosphere. This is made better by the fact that each song tells a different story, such as \"The Well of Souls\" about an occultist attempting to open a door to hell, \"At the Gallows End\" describing a man's last feelings and thoughts the night before his execution and \"Mourners Lament\" describing a parent's grief and inner turmoil following the death of his child. Each song is composed to fit the story it tells and does it very well.\n\nTo me, this is the go to the album for Candlemass. For someone who has never heard them before, I would say that this is the first one to check out. The songs are perfectly composed and just well executed, with every instrument balanced and mixed to a near perfect degree. All of which creates a nice moody atmosphere. The music itself is heavy, crushing and very dark but is also memorable, involving and leaves a deep and lasting impression. It's well worth the price to purchase. You won't be disappointed.\n",
        "\nCandlemass were one of the first doom metal bands I had ever listened to before I had ever come to realize what on Earth doom metal was, and I\u2019m definitely not the only one whom Candlemass was their first experience. So it was not long before I started investigating the genre further and with a righteous fury at that. While \u201cEpicus Doomicus Metallicus\u201d is a testament for time, it was \u201cNightfall\u201d that made its mark. This was the album that made me feel as if I had found something truly otherworldly. This would be the world of grief and despair. As crushing as it may be. \n\nThe instrumental tracks on this record all detail a sense of progression (a funeral procession?) and do not stray from the feel that Candlemass portray; thick and heavy and full of sorrow. Plus it is always magnificent to see a take of classical composers in metal, especially when it\u2019s Chopin\u2019s \u201cMarch Funebre\u201d. Now with that out of the way, the tracks that do indeed have lyrical content are all brilliant and I will endeavor to not go into all of them in depth, at least not too much. The first two are \u201cThe Well of Souls\u201d and \u201cAt the Gallows End\u201d, and I find that they are very much similar whilst having their own uniqueness. Here we\u2019ve got some slow and brooding guitar work with some upbringing leads here and there. Standard fare. Messiah Marcolin has a brilliant vocal performance here and can hit just about any note and it is most impressive. It leaves nothing more to desire. \n\nAs far as I am concerned, the undisputed masterpiece on this album is the track entitled \u201cSamarithan\u201d. While the vocals here do not shine as much as with the rest of the songs on the album, it does not set the track back from being a supreme entity of the doom metal master class. The lyrics reek of sadness, gloom, and hope, and I get a sense of some sort of personal touches from the lyricist. The riffs are as enjoyable as your mother\u2019s cooking and just as tasty, and the bass and drumming live up to their standards while not always standing out. The other standout is naturally \u201cBewitched\u201d, a song so catchy and cheesy you just can\u2019t help but love it. This probably has one of my favorite riffs of all time as well, and you know you\u2019ve tried to sing them...somehow. I really do not wish to say it, but I\u2019m going to anyway. It\u2019ll leave you bewitched (Brb, necking myself).\n\nThis is some essential doom metal listening right here. Giving Solitude Aeturnus a run for its money since ages ago. Not that there\u2019s much problem on that side of the fence, either.\n",
        "\nListening to Candlemass really makes me recover some of the perhaps naive hope I\u2019ve still got on the vast world of metal music. Too few are those who can, or even dared to try, remain vital and valid playing the most vintage form of metal itself. Candlemass excel in that department, I can tell you that.\n\nAs it happens with great albums, is not a single element, but the conjunctive planning and use of all the elements in them what makes \u201cPsalms fo the dead\u201d so memorable. Meaning neither is songwriting pretentious or fancy, but effective and thorough. Both catchy rocker songs and profound dark doom metal hymns are to be found in this one. In general this is the kind of record one can listen to once and again, and it rather becomes more fun, attractive and interesting each time. Also, and this is HUGE, the way these fucks managed climax and calm, choruses and stanzas and soloing and riffing when composing each song themselves is sharp as hell.\n\nGuitars and bass do exactly what pops Tommi and uncle Geezer taught the whole world how to do. They follow, support and challenge one another in a simply elegant way. Whereas almost all bands go for pointless speed, Lasse and Mappe rather intend to crush your ears with a slow to mid-paced bludgeon of dark rock. Drums do nothing but greatly support and hold the sensation of heaviness provoked by these guardians of six stringed ladies. Now, if \u2018twas Buttler and Iommi the ones who inspired most of the instrumental part of this record, it\u2019s Mr. Dio himself who works as a model for vocals.\n\nYes, good ol\u2019Ronnie is a legend and more than one feels insulted by the comparison now, but truly, Robert Lowe did a hell of a work here. Too bad this was his last album with Candlemass, apparently, due to poor live performance. Personally, I consider track 7, \u201cThe killing of the sun\u201d, an homage for one underrated but great cut in \u201cMob rules\u201d (Black Sabbath, 1980), and that feeling endures along all songs. Robert\u2019s vocals are clear, powerful and deep, just as they\u2019re supposed to be. This, my dear readers is one fancy fare well for such a singer.\n\nIn the sounding like Dio era Sabbies department, keyboards are an unavoidable must when re-creating that modest epic sound, and they rock precisely because of their discretion. That discretion by the by, is not only neglected but spitted on in \u201cSiren song\u201d whereof keyboards line and especially the solo are delightful in the most 70\u2019s-like way. Devils, did I enjoy this one. One could say this work\u2019s almost flawless.\n\nHad I had the chance of making any change to it before it was put out, I would have extended this album a little bit. Even though it goes on and on for about 50 minutes or so, a deep necessity for more remains even after listening to it around ten times. OK, OK, I\u2019ve listened to it a few more than that. It\u2019s interesting how it\u2019s exactly the metalheads that claim metal should stick to its roots and not to evolve into a more sophisticated kind of music, the same farts that disregard albums such as \u201cPsalms for the dead\u201d. No wonder \u201cold school\u201d is an expression that lost its meaning, yet if you ask me these are THE basics every band should be well aware of and never forget.\n\nOriginally written for www.globaldomination.se\n",
        "\nIt would be really hard for me to give a Candlemass album a poor rating, but I did consider giving Ancient Dreams about 80%. Hopefully, by the end of this review my reasoning will be explained.\n\nHowever, I'd like to start with the album cover, a copy of Thomas Cole's painting 'Youth'. That cover is a lot for any band to live up to, isn't it? There's a gorgeous, primal countryside with a foreboding mountain lurking at the horizon, above which we can see a temple in the sky - the celestial city. In the foreground is a tiny boat with 2 figures reaching towards that distant and unearthly emblem, straining to touch the unreachable.\n\nAnd yet, that scene describes Candlemass so exactly. The band sound, in a completely non-denominational sense, utterly godly as they stretch a musical finger towards the perfect city in the sky that, as we can tell from the fact they are playing doom metal, they know they will never reach. There is a hopeless crushing quality to the music and lyrics that in no way undermines the joyous celebration that those epic riffs seem to create: the vastness of the sound and vision is matched only by the emptiness of the reality, because without that mirage on the cover, it only shows a man in a boat and without those sublime ideas Candlemass are only 5 Swedes with instruments and dodgy haircuts (seriously, Google \"Leif Edling's mullet\").\n\nAncient Dreams is not the best Candlemass album, though it might contain the most perfectly realized songs of the band's career. 'Mirror Mirror' is a very strong opener, but is superseded 3 times as the best song on the album. 'Darkness in Paradise' has a wickedly haunting vocal line and the main riff sounds like a salute to angels; 'Bearer of Pain' is lyrically very involving and has a great solo; 'Ancient Dreams' really does sound like the sky opening up and the mysteries of the universe being revealed, even though the theme is concerning the futility of hope and the eternal longing that won't go away. Aside from those exquisite moments, there is a good general mixture of signature Candlemass elements. Slower songs are well balanced alongside faster riffs and sections, the leads are usually creative and satisfying, and Messiah gives perhaps his best performance with plenty of nuance alongside his famous power.\n\nMy complaints, however, are directed at 'Incarnation of Evil' and 'Black Sabbath Medley'. Sad to say but 'Incarnation of Evil' does not really sound like a Candlemass song, nor does it sound like a song by any other band I want to listen to. It's an example of a great band forgetting what makes them great, as the most bombastic epic doom machine in the world has a crack at subtlety, which isn't what this kind of music is about at all. The performance is flat, too slow and lifeless, and the riffs and vocal lines are very forgettable, not to mention the horrible cliche of the lyrics. 'Black Sabbath Medley' is not particularly bad, I just don't find it a helpful addition to this version of the album - I would prefer to just have a copy on disc 2 of the remastered edition alongside the live tracks. Candlemass and Sabbath are very different bands, whatever the debt of influence owed, and those very classic riffs sound horribly out of place after the last rites of the closing 'Epistle 81'.\n\nA few minor points to grumble about might be the slightly flat guitar tone (it attained levels of impeccable crispiness on the following full-length) or the moments that wander in the more generic 'A Cry from the Crypt' or the way that 'The Bells of Acheron' repeats a riff that isn't that interesting. The drums could sound a bit tighter as well, bearing in mind that I'm reviewing the remastered version, but I can't help but feel that these complaints are caused by the utter hugeness of 4 of the tracks on here, plus the don't-touch-anything beauty of 'Epistle 81'. I also award one bonus point for Leif Edling's description of Milton Keynes (where I currently live) in the liner notes with the apt summary that it's all roundabouts, but \"where are the people?\"\n\nNow, to explain my actual rating. If those 2 nasty songs mentioned above were removed from the release (at least from disc 1), Ancient Dreams would contain 7 songs and be 45 minutes long, which is plenty of time for a doom metal album, especially when the songs are as well developed as they are here. Of those 45 minutes, there is ONE other fault that I can find, which is the high note that Messiah hits in the chorus of 'Bearer of Pain', though even that's growing on me. Everything else, however, is just sublime. Everything else makes me feel like I could touch that castle in the sky.\n",
        "\nFrom the opening strains to the final fading echoes of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, Candlemass present six immersive songs of misery, fantasy and revelation.\n\nAfter a somber introduction with acoustic guitar, synth and vocals, \u201cSolitude\u201d lurches to life like a waking giant and plods along at a meditative pace, almost literally setting the tempo for the rest of the album. Mats Bjoerkman\u2019s rhythm guitar tone is reminiscent of Trouble, but the riffs are much slower while Klas Bergwall\u2019s lead tone is like tiny points of starlight briefly illuminating an otherwise cold dungeon. He gave his all in every solo like it was his last time appearing on a metal album or something. The solos on display here are still my favorite of all the Candlemass albums. Starlight then fades into the black hole called \u201cDemon\u2019s Gate,\u201d at which point I\u2019ve known some people to stop the CD and say it\u2019s just not for them. \u201cToo slow,\u201c they almost always say. However, if slow and crushing melodic riffs, epic lyrics and a subterranean atmosphere are just some of the things that draw you to metal then you have to go into the demon\u2019s gate. You just gotta do it. The nine-minute-plus trip into the bleeding infernal regions of Leif Edling\u2019s imagination will be worth it. You\u2019ll be hooked with every rise, fall and sinister twist of the riff that first appears at 1:11 and you\u2018ll know you\u2018re on the right path. At least, that\u2019s the riff I most wanted to learn to play after my first time hearing this album. The double bass drums later in the track act more as atmosphere than as percussion like the bubbling of black dragon's blood in a massive cauldron. The bassline at 4:22 isn't even pretending to show off as its methodical pulse further enforces the desolation of the lyrics and prepares you to explore even deeper caves illuminated only briefly by those magnificent solos.\n\n\u201cBlack Stone Wielder\u201d could be a play on the title of the Stephen Donaldson book, White Gold Wielder which, given his love of fantasy themes, I\u2019d bet Edling had at least heard of if not read. The lyrics, however, always reminded me of a dark interpretation of Christ's birth. You can see the Magi trudging through a cold desert at night as Johan Lanquist expertly draws you into the tale with his dramatic vocal style that feels like he\u2019s acting out the lyrics, but not hamming it up. Even his whisper sounds melodic when he says the black stone wielders were never seen again. The slow-motion crush at 3:22 begins another highlight of this album like the travellers struggling to continue despite being nearly exhausted by their journey. Like dinosaurs waltzing or planets rotating while revolving around a central star, it\u2019s a strange kind of beautiful melody that stands apart from the rest of the album like you\u2018ve just stepped into a realm that even the band themselves didn\u2018t realize they could create. A solo tries to offer the travellers some relief, but its deliberate cadence could be either a dirge or an exhortation depending on how you hear it. One of the best moments of the album is when this section segues into the song\u2019s signature bouncing riff as the solo picks up the pace and the song rolls on to its destination.\n\n\u201cA Sorceror's Pledge\u201d is still my favorite Candlemass song. The atmosphere from beginning to end is remarkable. The tone of every instrument and effect works together to create an apocalyptic vision similar to what the sorceror may have seen in his thousand-year dream. It begins with Lanquist\u2019s vocals filling the whistling wind with lamentations that will be further elaborated in the main body of the song. The transition to a heavier tone after the last strum of the acoustic guitar is the part where I start increasing the volume, daring the limits of my speakers because I want to feel as if I\u2019m hearing titans perform this song on guitars the size of oak trees through amps the size of glaciers. It\u2019s epic doom, dude. How else is it supposed to be heard? After the monumental heaviness, the song comes down again to build toward the ending as the synth takes over with a new melody like starlight trying to return and shine through the darkness to see if the sorceror will keep his pledge or if the dream quest was too much for him to endure. You can't tell if the angelic vocals of the finale symbolize the sorceror's promised return or if it's the sound of a heavenly host welcoming him to a divine realm, but their tone give the album an all too brief moment of utter joy. \n\nOverall, I describe Epicus Doomicus Metallicus as somewhere between a melodic approach to Black Sabbath and a heavy approach to Legend\u2019s From the Fjords. Imaginative and powerful while retaining that arcane touch that separates it from subsequent Candlmass albums. Doom certainly wasn\u2019t a new concept upon this album\u2018s release, but the fact that Candlemass had the audacity to brand themselves in such a way as the title was not only an obvious mission statement, but it helped give the genre a new idea of what it could be to the point where now it\u2019s not uncommon for bands to refer to themselves as epic doom metal or for listeners to describe a band as epic doom metal. Just a fantastic album from beginning to end.\n",
        "\nOn October 4th 1989 at the Hammersmith Odeon in London there was a gig that at the time I would have given my left leg away to see. I remember at the time it would have been taking place cursing my age and inability to get myself to the big smoke to watch the show. I was 15 at the time and there was no way my parents would let me go with friends, let alone on my own. So instead I cursed my luck and listened to records at home instead. The bands that were playing that night were my UK favourites Acid Reign along with Dark Angel and Nuclear Assault. Plus, launching the release of their band new album was Sweden\u2019s very own doom metal masters Candlemass. At the time I could think of nothing greater except for maybe a joint headline show of Kreator and Celtic Frost.\n\nCandlemass\u2019 called their new record Tales Of Creation and the first thing I noticed that was different from its two predecessors was that both Nightfall and Ancient Dreams used the artwork from painter Thomas Cole\u2019s Voyage Of Life series. I would have loved to see the artwork for Tales Of Creation to be the originally planned Manhood painting in this series bit alas it was not to be. Instead, in his family\u2019s bible bass player and main songwriter Leif Edling saw a print from artist Gustave Dore called Let There Be Light, an epic piece in itself showing its own tale of creation, God birthing the world with light.\n\nOne thing that did remain intact was the ultra heavy, dirge paced doom laden riffs. The sound here is crisper than on any other Candlemass release before it and also since. The track Tears is a perfect example of this, the snails pace creates an atmospheric air to the song when filled with Messiah Marcolin\u2019s operatic vocals. The pace is picked up slightly for Dark Reflections which is unusually mid tempo for the band. The now classic riffs and Messiah\u2019s \u201cI was dead, awake in hell. a lonely corpse to break the spell\u201d chorus remains in your head long after lyrics of this dubious quality should.\n\nHighlight of the album for me is the title track. It wraps up the loose concept about a soul sent on a mission from the Gods through Hell, Heaven and Earth to discover his true purpose or some such gibberish. I am sure that as a kid I loved this idea but now coming back as an adult it doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense to me. The main riff is a brute of a thing, better than any other to be recorded during 1989. That\u2019s one hell of a statement considering what else was on offer in 1989. On top of this guitarist Lars Johansson provides some incredible lead work as well. For a doom metal fan this is amazing stuff.\n\nNot so good is the almost speed metal guitar wank fest that is Into the Unfathomed Tower. Whilst I\u2019m not criticising its display of heroic metal musicianship it breaks up the flow of the album too much for my liking. If you are going to do a concept album fine but don\u2019t stick what is essentially a three minute b side into the mix.\n\nMany people I have spoken to into today\u2019s traditional metal scene are not even aware that Candlemass exist let alone recorded albums as good as this. For those I would immediately recommend digging up this gem of an LP and for those lucky enough to have had been at that Hammersmith gig I envy the hell out of you.\n",
        "\nFor all intents and purposes, this is the last Candlemass album. Thus, it\u2019s a sad day for metal, as it bids goodbye to the prospect of fresh material from one of its most important formative entities. The band has not broken up, mind, but they\u2019ve stated with relative finality that they do not wish to grow stagnant, and thus are ending their full-length legacy here at number 11 with Psalms for the Dead. While I would not qualify this as one of their very best records, it nevertheless draws upon all of the things that make Candlemass truly great, and proves a very solid goodbye. Personally, I think Leif Edling and co. have the potential for another masterpiece in them, and hope for a follow up down the road, but as far as legacies go, this is a more than satisfactory requiem.\n\nPsalms for the Dead exists very much in the same realm as the last few records, and continues to be fronted by Solitude Aeternus front-man Robert Lowe, whom I\u2019ve always felt has fit the band perfectly, particularly in the astonishing King of the Grey Islands. His dynamic range continues to serve the vast, epic compositional nature, with charismatic yet melancholy bellowing rising above the dark, ornate slabs of riffing. He may not be quite as impressively maniacal or varied as Messiah Marcolin, but I\u2019ve had no issues with any of his performances here. As for the record itself, you can expect a healthy 50 minutes of thick, lumbering, Sabbath-influenced doom, drawing from the well of fantasy in both lyrical and atmospheric strati. As always, the tones here are just crushing, a dense low-end crunch that proves full and resonant. Edling\u2019s bass is particularly satisfying, like rhythmic shifting of tectonic plates beneath the fiery oceans of riffing. \n\nSpeaking of riffing, the quality here is incredibly consistent, with a strong breadth of songs that nicely encapsulate what exactly Candlemass is. Overall, I felt the compositional tendency was a bit on the safe side, with relatively predictable structures for verse, chorus, and refrain, but the tone of the individual tracks shifts enough to be engrossing, and as always, there are a good number of addictive choruses present and accounted for. I\u2019d be remiss, however, if I didn\u2019t mention that I feel an opportunity may have been wasted here to delve into some more progressive variations, paying tribute to the adventurous nature of their earlier material. Black as Time is the exception to this, with more unconventional tactics, and is incredibly satisfying as it morphs through varying incarnations. Regardless, any real fan of the band is going to find a lot to like here, as it\u2019s all unmistakably Candlemass, in all their ornate mythological grandeur. It\u2019s noticeably less oppressive than fans of their earlier material might want, as the songs don\u2019t always have that weighty, menacing quality many look for, but it\u2019s highly functional and memorable nevertheless. There\u2019s some organ-like keyboard additions scattered throughout as well, adding some unique flavor in a creepy, vaguely Castlevania-esque style. It\u2019s easy to feel like one is trapped in a haunted cathedral, beset by looming fantastical creatures, and other such imagery. In essence, its doom metal, conjuring the level of atmosphere one would expect from the guys who virtually wrote the fucking playbook. Heavy, unique, dark, and addictive, there is a lot to like here.\n\nPsalms for the Dead is divided pretty well into subsections that all resonate with spiritual trappings of classic heavy and doom, but with appreciably distinct variables innate to each. Prophet has a dreamy midsection with addictive vocal lines and some beautiful guitar-work, a strong opening piece that conjures classic heavy metal with its thick, elegant licks; Dancing in the Temple of the Mad Queen Bee thrives on simplicity, but provides the hooks necessary to snare you in as it bounces between organ-ornamented marching and vibrant, memorable leads; The Lights of Thebe feels like some traditional Candlemass, displaying a creeping, permeating grandeur through thick, epic chords and some powerful vocal work from Lowe; though not quite reaching the overwhelming quality of Nightfall, Ancient Dreams, or even King of the Grey Islands, there are truly no losers here, as each track proves to be both satisfying and memorable, all but demanding multiple listens.\n\nYou know, it really doesn\u2019t get more iconic than Candlemass. It just doesn\u2019t. While Psalms for the Dead may not be the stunning masterwork many were hoping for, given the finality present here, and doesn\u2019t really herald many surprises for those familiar with their work in the last ten years, it\u2019s hard not to feel swept up in the dark fantasy epic that this band still weaves with ease. In 1986, these guys took the heavy blues of Sabbath and imbued it with a billowing darkness and a propensity for absolutely crushing riff-craft, literally changing metal forever, and in this reviewer\u2019s opinion, have barely even stumbled since, even in the harder times around the turn of the century. Pslams for the Dead delivers on this promise with spirit and grace. It\u2019s achingly sad to say goodbye to a band that\u2019s given us so much, but it\u2019s simultaneously admirable that they chose to bow out before they could descend into a caricature, though personally I find that instance virtually impossible. Candlemass are one of the best, most important metal bands of all time, doom or otherwise, and Psalms for the Dead is one last love letter displaying that fact, one that every self-respecting fan of heaviness should experience, if only for its significance as the closing chapter in an absolutely stellar career. \n\nIt\u2019s with a heavy heart and a cheeky adherence to cliche that I bid Candlemass a fond farewell, but I think we, and they, can be satisfied with the fact that they\u2019ve created a host of undying musical worlds, a self-contained, ageless universe of heaviness that will continue to awe and inspire future generations to unleash their own unique emanations of heavy metal, on until our psychotic race inevitably destroys itself. Whether that\u2019s later this month, or in a thousand years, at the gallows end or at the killing of the sun, may the hammer of doom pound on, eternal, through the infinitive halls of death.\n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\n1992 was the year of my first meeting with Swedish Candlemass. This album was called \u201cChapter VI\u201d. And after listening to it, I thought \u201cquite good heavy metal band\u201d. But at the time \u201cWhen the Runes Still Speak\u201d song seemed to be most interesting on the album. What is more, it rather didn\u2019t fit to the entirety due to its very slow and monumental structure. Anyway I decided to check this band out, and bought the rest of discography, or better the rest of un-original tapes copied in my country, because there was no chance to get the original ones. Definitely the best one was the tape entitled \u201cNightfall\u201d with incorrect track-list (standard thing here in Poland in the old times). \n\n\u201cNightfall\u201d, the second performance of these Swedes, was another test for the young band. Even if they released \u201cEpicus Doomicus Metallicus\u201d one year earlier, I treat \u201cNightfall\u201d as the second debut. Why? Because after the releasing of debut, the band lost three members: vocalist, guitarist and drummer were gone. Fortunately these significant changes weren\u2019t heavy loss for the crew, on the contrary the new guys pumped some new blood to the organism. Especially the vocalist Jan Bror Alfredo Marcolin, or better known as Messiah Marcolin, became an identification mark for Candlemass. His unique vocals (resemblance to opera singers) were complete contrast to the previous Johan L\u00e4ngquist, moreover Marcolin\u2019s kind of singing perfectly fitted to the music, in addition his scenic image gained reputation among the fans, just like another surname \u201cMr. Doomdance\u201d. Of course, gifted and original vocalist does not mean successful album. Yes, this is an elemental truth, but when it comes to the musical entirety of the second Candlemass recording, another elemental truth is coming: the music is simply\u2026 superb. \u201cNightfall\u201d beat the debut, but the quality jump wasn\u2019t gigantic, because the first epic doom revelation in Candlemass career was pure metal greatness too, and the successor is a continuation of the chosen way. \n\nThe amount of the songs may lead into error. Only six of them are with vocals lines, so can I write about laziness or musical tardiness in composing? No, of course not. The debut album also had six songs, so I think there is no surprise here. These four instrumental tracks are small additions, the first of them, called \u201cGothic Stone\u201d is an introduction to \u201cThe Well of Souls\u201d. The same is with the next ones: \u201cCodex Gigas\u201d based on heavy guitars, \u201cMarche Funebre\u201d (taken from F. Chopin) and the finishing track \u201cBlack Candles\u201d written by Mike Wead, full of sorrow and revery, right choice to end the recording. Of course that four isn\u2019t the salt of the doom earth. And when I start to think about the best song on the album, \u201cAt the Gallows End\u201d comes to my mind immediately. What is more, I treat it the best doom song ever written. It has calm beginning with warm solo lead and some acoustic tunes, after thirty seconds powerful guitar riffs and drums enter the stage, just like phenomenal vocals. With words \u201c\u2026sunrise I greet you, the beauty of your light\u2026\u201d the band creates excellent, unforgettable catchy melodic lines, then after one minute the song becomes typical Candlemass work with all epic doom riches. Guitar riffs are maintained rather in faster tempo as compared to hypnotic and slow \u201cThe Well of Souls\u201d, these beautiful vocals/melodies are shown once again, in addition the song is decorated by memorable guitar lead by Lars. To be honest with myself, without any difficulty, I can define \u201cAt the Gallows End\u201d as summary of the album. Obviously, these impressive moments are also served in other songs, but such beautiful melodies are played rather rarely. Nevertheless each of them is a classic track of epic doom metal. I nearly forget about debut thrilling rawness during listening to \u201cNightfall\u201d, yet musical and harmony arrangements are better and more interesting on the second album. Joining Lars Johansson as a new guitarist was also very good idea. Mixing incredible heaviness and specific melody lines (more hidden than in my best track, but also marvelous), these agents of doom metal recorded an absolute thing: by no manner of means the mighty cruel time cannot spoil this doom monolith. \n\nThis album is a good example where four elements like music, lyrics, production and front-cover are inseparable unity. The artwork that ornaments \u201cNightfall\u201d is a picture of American painter Thomas Cole, entitled \u201cOld Age\u201d and completely fits to the entirety. The death motive is present here, when an angel guides an old man sitting in the boat and waiting for eternal redemption and simply better reality. This journey runs through the dark and ominous clouds, but on the end there is a light (or the entrance to paradise) giving hope to the tired human being. Lyrics written by Edling don\u2019t vary from this subject matter shown by Cole, the title word of the album is a consequence of life, because the death or the nightfall of man is something inexorable. The Swedes also told about the moment of death and profound sadness during whole life, like in \u201cMourners Lament\u201d, where father bewails child\u2019s death. For me this story is most dismaying on the album, effigy of death is very sensible and while listening to this monumental song, I couldn\u2019t feel indifference. Simply I can understand the message coming straight from the song, because I am also father of two children. The lyrics are supported by music full of total sadness, it perfectly fits to the story: colossal, crushing riffs bathing in slow tempo with paralyzing Lars solo lead. And this atmosphere where readily noticeable vision of merciless death befogs the human senses\u2026\n\nThe realization of sound helps the music to conquer my metal heart. My cd is a re-edition, everything here is audible (but the same was with my unoriginal tape), so what do I want more, if the music itself is served on the highest metal level. That\u2019s obvious Candlemass reached an epic doom peak, as well as they defined (also with the debut album) the idea of the style. \u201cNightfall\u201d is a denial to the boredom, by creating slow and monumental anthems, these five Swedes recorded masterful slab of doom or metal in general. They smuggled life truths, yet life searchings of something better not only on earthy valley. Sadness, grief, despair, downheartedness, fatality, loss of life\u2026 but there is (always?) a small light of hope sparkling in the deep dark, just like in \u201cSamarithan\u201d song, where the man becomes an angel after his death. Musically I get once again slow superb piece of paralyzing doom with beautiful chorus. \n\nAnd on the end, I\u2019d like to set forth some words from the chorus of \u201cBewitched\u201d, namely: \u201cYou are bewitched\u2026\u201d. Yes, I am bewitched\u2026 by this timeless classic metal music\u2026\n",
        "\nAs is often the case with bands whose legacies were unquestionably formed many years ago and today have no hope of ever topping I have a hard time working out what to make of their latest release. The teenage fan in me wishes for them to not change the template that many them so strong but the realist accepts this doesn't happen, and for the best. Which brings me to Candlemass, the kings of doom. Their recent releases have indeed been good, as seen by 2009's \"Death Magic Doom\" and now \"Psalms for the Dead\" but the majesty of the earlier material feels a long way from the modern, heavy sound we have here on album no. 11.\n\nRecorded with erstwhile Solitude Aeturnus vocalist Rob Lowe who has since left since release, \"Psalms\u2026\" sees Candlemass looking to solidify their position as the doom headliner of 2012, even if newer, younger bands have released better, more essential albums in recent years. The pace of their tomes these days hovers at more of a slow-medium rather than the dead slow of old, with time spent split between the lurching of \"The Sound of Dying Demons\", the psychedelic \"Waterwitch\", a more upbeat \"Prophet\" and the epic title-track. The use of keyboards, tuned to sound as an organist does in an old church, add an extra dimension to the periods where their usage accompanies the lead guitar and main riff (as in \"Psalms for the Dead\") or as a song-leading element like in \"The Killing of the Sun\". As someone not usually too taken by the sounds of keyboard I can vouch for their justified and elegant usage here, the difference being the experience of bassist and songwriter Leif Edling in knowing how to nail the true feeling of doom at a whim. Added to all, the bands knack of writing a great vocal harmony; done previously in recent years with \"Of Stars and Smoke\" on \"King of the Grey Islands\", the leading one found in this here title track (yes that track again) with Lowe's recognisable crooning will knock the socks off you.\n\nNot all moments are quite so solid - notably closer \"Black As Time\" which is a total waste of 7 minutes, and much of \"Siren Song\" which plods along despite the best hammond efforts of Opeth's Per Wiberg - but for a band so steeped in doom (and metal) heritage there is much to admire and like on \"Psalms for the Dead\". Best post-Y2K album from the Swedes? A hard one to call given the consistency of all four, but a worthy addition to a catalogue already bursting with doom greatness.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nWith the start of yet another month of pure Metal taking us on a roller coaster ride, it is time we bid farewell to one of the greats, who steered this ride and touched our hearts with their music. Candlemass, the Black Sabbath of Doom Metal, have now released their final studio album Psalms for the Dead, waving their fans a final goodbye in style! This album is a perfect example of how a band should end their career in the studio. From sheer evil and diabolic riffs too some face melting solos, the album has it all! But sadly, just when Robert Lowe began to hit the right note to fit in the band through this album, he was announced no longer a part of the band quite recently.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cProphet\u201d was a great start to the album with the typical elements of doom embedded in it. This makes you crave for some more and as you move to the next track, you will be greeted with a tweak of a surprise with \u201cDancing in the Temple\u201d. This song seemed to deviate slightly from their heavy, slow and haunting sound to more of a slow power metal inclination. This song sets you right into the mood for more of Candlemass, with 3 blistering solos. Noticeably, almost every song treats you with some diverse solos by Lars Johansson. Per Wiberg (ex-Opeth) has added his own spices to this well cooked piece of art with a beautiful solo in the \u201cSiren Song\u201d on the keys.\n\nEvery song in the album has a different feel to it. Like, \u201cKilling of the Sun\u201d gives you a total Black Sabbath feel to your ears. Not to forget, Leif Edling has done a fabulous job on the bass with some hot and heavy portions in \u201cBlack as Time\u201d. I certainly expected some intricate acoustic guitar magic like that of the most well-known song of the band, \u201cSolitude\u201d, from their first album Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. But setting that apart, this album seems flawless, and yet another masterpiece!\n\nTo choose the 3 best tracks from the album, I\u2019d say my number one choice would be \u201cThe Lights of Thebe\u201d, because in this one, although the band maintains their reputation of sounding evil, it takes a different turn with some lovely symphony and a sweet solo with an oriental feel to it. At second place would be, \u201cDancing in the Temple\u201d because of the downpour of three solos and the slight deviation from the typical sound they usually play. Lastly, I\u2019d choose the track \u201cPsalms for the Dead\u201d that matches its title to that of the album, because of the very impressive strong structure! The dual solo song is well fitted with some commendable transitions and an outro that will surely leave you in a trance, at the end.\n\nI always felt as long as Candlemass will exist, the standard of doom metal will remain high. Without much ado, I\u2019ll conclude by saying that this album was sick enough to be called legendary and is a perfect full stop as they fade away from the limelight, leaving their legacy behind. For me, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, Nightfall and now Psalms for the Dead stand at the top of my list of best doom metal albums ever made and Candlemass will remain one of the biggest influences for this genre. Even though the sub-division of this doom metal style does not have many bands that would make it proud, Candlemass is enough, and this album shows why. Now, solely a touring band, they have replaced Robert Lowe with Mats Leven on the vocals. Buy the album, irrespective of what sub-genre of metal you prefer because this album is the pinnacle of sheer mastery.\n\nOriginal review by me on :\nhttp://www.metalwani.com/2012/06/review-candlemass-psalms-for-dead.html\n",
        "\nCandlemass is an epic doom metal band hailing from the country of Sweden. They have been coined the originators of epic doom metal, and have been HANDS DOWN dominating the genre since 1984. The band split up in 1994, only to be reformed in 1997 by original member Leif Edling, the bassist/vocalist. Just recently, June 2, 2012, the band announced on their website that their current vocalist Robert Lowe has been replaced by a long-time friend of the band Mats Lev\u00e9n. The band has reassured fans that they will continue to play shows and are rehearsing new and old songs with the new vocalist.\n\nCandlemass has a massive discography, just recently adding to it with their new full length, Psalms for the Dead, released June 6, 2012. This album has been said to be the last release from Candlemass, though the band has assured their fans they won\u2019t be splitting up. Hearing that this was the last Candlemass album to be released really upset me and trust me, I had HIGH hopes for it. I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\n\nCandlemass has this way of grabbing you by the balls and throwing some true hard and heavy doom at you, yet making you want to dance at the same time. If you\u2019re an avid listener\u2026 you understand. This new album is NO exception. Every single track is fantastic, well written, and beautifully haunting!\n\nPsalms for the Dead starts off with a crushing track Prophet, with haunting vocals and lyrics about false gods, driving guitars and bass, and crushing drums, it\u2019s a perfect start to the farewell album from Candlemass. The beautiful melodic guitar work in this song comes out of a thick, doomy atmosphere, bringing an entire new emotion to the song, and then quickly falls back into the heaviness we all know.\n\nWaterwitch is another noteworthy track on the album, opening with a bad ass doomy riff with amazing reverb on the guitar then continues into some deep and mellow vocals by Lowe. The song as a whole has a dark, creepy feeling to it, with a deep, prominent bass line and mournful tones produced by guitar and vocals, layered ever so perfectly. Siren Song, my favorite on the album, brings in an entire new feeling with an organ, adding the lamentation of the album.\n\nBlack As Time ends the album with a spoken word about time and what it means to us all, which undeniably states \u201cSlowly and almost unnoticed\u2026 second by second\u2026tick tock, tick tock, tick tock\u2026 it continues the countdown closer to your grave\u2026 until it finally stops. TIME IS BLACK!\u201d then the song opens up with an explosion of beautiful mournful lyrics ending with Lowe screaming Time Is Black.\n\nIt really disappoints me to think that this is in fact their last record. I\u2019ve been a fan of everything they have put out over the many years they have been around. This album is most definitely a great way to say farewell to the doom metal world they\u2019ve been a part of for so long\u2026 their swansong if you will. Well Candlemass, you will be dearly missed.\n\n[Originally written for themetalreview.com]\n",
        "\nSo this is to be Candlemass\u2019s final recorded album. The last ever musical statement from the doom icons, innovators and one of metal\u2019s overall greatest bands. Wouldn\u2019t it be terrible if it was a disappointment \u2013 a flimsy and shallow offering from a fading shadow of a band? Well luckily it\u2019s not. This album is great, and that\u2019s in the truest sense of the term. In fact the only disappointing thing about this album is the knowledge that Robert Lowe is no longer in the band and will subsequently never perform any of these great songs live. Oh well, that fact doesn\u2019t change the quality of \u2018Psalms For The Dead\u2019; it\u2019s a beast of an album and a truly appropriate sound with which to bow out from an amazing recording career. \n\nSong-wise there is a fair amount of variety here; in fact the band display a slightly lighter and more upbeat approach on much of the material that actually makes a nice change from the previous album. Note the word slightly, because it is not to say that band have turned away from doom or made a power metal album or something. Not at all. This album is an absolute doom album in every way. But notable is the increased use of organ and keyboard sounds on a lot of the songs that adds an additional dimension and certain mood: maybe slightly more psychedelic and 70s sounding, but it\u2019s not a total sound shift, just a different one. A good example of this sound is the single \u2018Dancing in the Temple (Of the Mad Queen Bee)\u2019, but there are multiple others. \n\nI don\u2019t do song-by-song reviews because it doesn\u2019t seem necessary, but it is enough to say that every song has something different about it, a unique draw, and this means that the album does not turn into one great big similar-sounding dirge. There\u2019s a lot of individual character to be heard. For example \u2018The Lights of Thebe\u2019 has an eastern/Arabic flavour to it that Candlemass haven\u2019t really played with before, while the most doom-ridden and ominous song has to be \u2018Waterwitch\u2019 which reminds me somewhat of \u2018Hammer of Doom\u2019 from the last album. The song \u2018The Killing of the Sun\u2019 has a Black Sabbath riff reminiscent of \u2018Iron Man\u2019 which creates the impression of a more playful and fanciful band; it\u2019s as if they\u2019re saying \u2018 this is our last album, let\u2019s have some fun and go out with a bang. We love Sabbath so let\u2019s do a Sabbath song\u2019 (Despite this the lyrics are still dark as hell, as they are across the album \u2013 no lightening up there thankfully). Essentially you get the feeling that the band have really tried hard to get all aspects of their sound over the years on to one album, and to my mind they have succeeded in this admirably. \n\nOne slightly strange thing about this album is the final song \u2018Black As Time.\u2019 The song and riffs themselves are classic, but there is an English guy speaking over some of it, voicing philosophical musings on the nature of time and its destructive nature. Now this is probably Candlemass promoting their more whimsical and weird side, but personally I\u2019m not quite convinced by this song. This is probably because the guy speaking reminds me slightly of Eric Idle, and subsequently it is a little hard to take seriously. I couldn\u2019t help but think that this is the last song on the last ever album; why do the band want to bow out with that guy\u2019s voice ringing in the listener\u2019s ears? But still, they\u2019re trying something new and in its own bizarre way it works; it\u2019s just never going to be my favourite Candlemass song. \n\nSpeaking more technically the production is excellent: extremely crisp and loud making the band sound heavy and powerful. The playing is great from all, from the drums and Leif\u2019s thick bass lines to the riff guitars and the truly memorable and impressive lead playing. As noted above, the organ and keyboard sounds add a lot to the songs and are extremely well played and fitting. And of course, anyone who\u2019s listened to any significant amount of doom will know the vocals of Robert Lowe. I won\u2019t labour the point too much here: he\u2019s always been an excellent, epic and unique singer and he still is on this album. He\u2019s the star of the show for sure, along with Leif\u2019s brilliant, as always, song-writing.\n\nWhen most people consider \u2018classic\u2019 Candlemass they\u2019re thinking of the first three or four albums, but the truth is they have never released a bad album. \u2018Psalms For The Dead\u2019 is no different. Hopefully it will be remembered as more than just their last album because the songs truly add to their legacy; they\u2019re potent and powerful, full of character and interest, and are essentially classic Candlemass. I\u2019m sad to see them go, but I\u2019m happy to report that they have truly gone out on a high. \n\nOriginally written for: http://hauntingtheobscure.blogspot.co.uk/\n",
        "\nDoom giants Candlemass return to deliver their eleventh and possibly final full length album of a long and illustrious career. Psalms for the Dead is an elegant work of massive, riff-endowed heavy metal from start to finish. Robert Lowe handles vocal duties again, albeit for the last time, as the band announced on their official web site June 2nd that he has been dismissed due to \u201cquality of live performances.\u201d A Swedish dude named Mats Leven will be taking over for the ensuing tour dates.\n\n\u201cProphet\u201d opens the album with doom-dance domination, making plain the confidence of the musicians and mastery of their craft. The first riff you will hear is pure, bone crushing doom, then they up the tempo with beefy double kicks and the mighty voice of Robert Lowe. The instrumentalists here consist of the classic line-up, with main man and bassist Leif Edling, the Johansson/Bjorkman guitar duo, and drummer Jan Lindh. Keyboardist Per Wiberg of Opeth fame plays the Hammond organ on one track of Psalms for the Dead, and will be joining Candlemass for the upcoming tour. Second track \u201cThe Sound of Dying Demons\u201d is plodding and slow, opening with a heavy floor tom beat and the subtle sound of a storm in the background. Jan Lindh has been referred to as a \u201cboring\u201d drummer, but in my opinion he is an ideal doom metal drummer, doing his job with good taste and tact. Besides, if you\u2019re listening to metal for drum kit wankery, doom might be the wrong genre for you.\n\n\u201cWaterwitch\u201d is just fuckin awesome, with a bit of wah-pedal employed on the beginning riff a-la Mr. Iommi\u2019s \u201cElectric Funeral.\u201d Edling\u2019s creeping bass line beneath Lowe\u2019s mournful voice in the verse juxtaposed to mammoth riffing make this a standout track of the album, and there\u2019s also some tremendous lead guitar shredding to make it a complete masterpiece of a heavy metal song. I think Candlemass could probably write quality albums until they croak; their well of riffs seems to be bottomless. Interestingly enough, lead axe man Lars Johansson is a lefty, as is the godfather himself, so maybe that has something to do with it.\n\nPsalms for the Dead comes with special packaging with some excellent band photos, printed lyrics, and a bonus DVD featuring some cool behind the scenes footage. If you happen to have a copy of Nightfall lying around, it\u2019s interesting to compare the physical appearance of Candlemass twenty-five years ago to that of the same band today. Leif Edling seems to be ageless. The liner notes also feature a black and white illustration of the band that calls to mind the back cover of Heaven and Hell. \n\nThe onslaught of manly riffing continues into the title track, with the keyboards adding an eerie dimension to the overall tone of lamentation. \u201cPsalms for the Dead / Songs for the Living\u201d is the profound and triumphant cry of Robert Lowe on this crusher. It is indeed disheartening to see the departure of this amazing singer from Candlemass, especially after the success of Death Magic Doom and King of the Grey Islands. I do enjoy the classic albums featuring Messiah Marcolin (though his vibrato was a bit much at times) but I don\u2019t think Lowe or Marcolin could match the powerful pipes of Johan Langquist, the session vocalist featured on Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. That dude ruled. One of the most alluring aspects of Candlemass has always been their operatic singers, so new guy Mats Leven must be presumably awesome. \n\nPer Wiberg\u2019s signature Hammond organ styling is featured on \u201cSiren Song,\u201d where he even plays the lead beginning at 2:25. Closer \u201cBlack as Time\u201d starts with the sound of a ticking clock and a cynical spoken word piece on the cold and unforgiving nature of time. \u201cTime is the sword of destruction, a faceless conqueror, the master of DOOM.\u201d Only Candlemass could so eloquently capture the fatalism of time. This may be the swansong of these doom legends, and if so, they are finishing with grace and power, offering an album chock full of fist-pumping riffs and profound lyrical dissertations. We can only hope that they\u2019ve got another one left in `em.\n",
        "\nSince I started listening to doom metal, Candlemass quickly became a respected member of my favorite metal bands and this album is one of my all time favorite metal albums. This is not their best work, but Tales Of Creation is strong enough to blow minds of listeners and bring them the spirit of doom.\n\nPersonally, I think that this is their second best album after Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. First of all, this is concept album, which already means enjoyable. Second, here Messiah Marcolin really sings with power, as is needed in epic doom metal, meanwhile when on the previous album, Ancient Dreams, his vocal were weak and it seemed like he didn't want to sing. And third, this album has strong and melodic choruses, which makes its heavenly music even more epic.\n\nWhen you start this album, you will be met by 'The Prophecy', some kind of intro, but it already expresses many emotions of the album and it lets listeners know what is waiting for them. Here is used the last riff from last track, 'A Tale Of Creation', so it seems that this album starts with this riff and ends with it, so in other words, this is a circle album. Then comes thepowerful song 'Dark Reflections'. It isn't remarkable by melodiousness, but the vocal parts are epic and 'doomic'.\n\nThen comes filler 'Voices of the Wind' and then the well-known masterpiece 'Under The Oak', but with Marcolin on vocals. Well, his version is very interesting and enjoyable, but I prefer 'Under The Oak' from 'Epicus Doomicus Metallicus'. Johan L\u00e4ngquist sings it with whole emotion and I can't imagine any other version.\n\nHere is the 3 minutes long instrumental called 'Into the Unfathomed Tower'. It has many fast solos, maybe out of concept, but great anyway. Then comes one of the strongest songs, 'The Edge Of Heaven', which contains melodic and 'doomic' vocals with powerful solo. Messiah's vocal fits perfectly here.\n\nThe concept of this album is a tale of how the chosen one created the world. The last track, 'A Tale Of Creation', crowns this story well. Its outro is something epic, sounding like the final moments of mankind. It feels this way when you realize that this album has just ended.\n\nAside from everything this is, being heavy, strong and powerful, this album is tragic as well, and after listening to it many times, you don't feel that something is needed and you don't feel emptiness here. As I said, for me this is not their best work, but I love this album most because after listening to it again and again, you feel a wild desire to do it again and again and again and again and again.\n",
        "\nI must say, I expected nothing from this album to be honest. I had never listened to Candlemass before, only heard their name. But I do enjoy doom metal, so I decided to pick up their latest release to see what the fuss was all about. I expected slow, depressive music, like for example Reverend Bizarre, and to a certain extent I kind of got it, but I also got a kind of modern speed/powermetal, especially from Robert. \n\nThe overall sound of the instruments on the album is that of thickness and power. We're not talking BLS or Crowbar here, but a kind of distorted sound common to the genre. And Robert Lowe's voice shows many different sides in the songs on the album. It can go from lurking, sly and evil to the more theatric high-pitch of speed/powermetal (think a more downtuned Bruce Dickinson). \n\nLeif's bass adds the power needed to really give the distorted guitars of Lars and Mappe a big boost. This combination of distortion and power works very well both in the faster and slower songs. The structure of the riffing is not too complicated, sometimes erupting into pretty groovy parts, and in the midst of all the rawness comes several solos to fulfill the songs.\n\nHowever, sometimes it feels like Jan's drumming get's lost in all the heaviness. It's constantly there, but sometimes seem to drown in the powerfull guitarwork. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, since it makes you focus on the power of the songs, which in itself pulls the music forwards on it's own. \n\nAs for the lyrics, they mostly deal with evil, horror and madness. Not overly poetic (the kind of lyrics I usually prefer), instead it feels like Robert is telling you a story with every song, a good story too I might add. The verses are usually sung with that whispering, evil voice of his, while during the climax he usually changes it to his more high-pitched voice, surely inspired by King Diamond, Michael Kiske and the likes. Both voices work very well, and fits the albums image perfectly.\n\nMy favorite songs on the album must be \"Demon of the Deep\", a slow paced song with lyrics that no doubt should make you think of Cthulhu, if you're familiar with Lovecraft's mythical sea creature, and \"House of 1000 Voices\", a twisted tale about ghost children in a burnt down orphanage. \n\nOverall, this is a modern doom metal album with good production value, heavy distortion and excellent singing and good storytelling lyrics.\n",
        "\nWhile Black Sabbath may have pioneered the doom metal, it was Candlemass that solidified the style of music we know today as doom. Granted, I was a little put off their debut album's title, but after listening, I have no doubt that 'Epicus Doomicus Metallicus' delivers what it promises. \n\nThis is considered a classic of the doom metal sound for very good reason; the band captures a dense, heavy song while simultaneously fueling it with intelligent, richly orchestrated songwriting. Led creatively by bassist Leif Edling, the music of Candlemass is slow, crushing, and emotionally charged; all now-fundamental tenants of the style. What I think distinguishes Candlemass' music from earlier work from bands like Sabbath however is that while Sabbath aimed for their brand of 'doom' to be evil and foreboding, Candlemass was among the first to get a little more introspective and melancholic. That's not to imply in the slightest that the sound here is anything but badass, however. Each of these six tracks lumbers on with thick guitar riffs, and a pummeling rhythm section that is offset only by the presence of some lighter synth arrangements that give the compositions an almost baroque quality to them. Best of all are the vocals of Johan L\u00e4ngqvist, who belts out powerfully, as if he was singing in an opera house. L\u00e4ngqvist manages to strike a nice balance between sounding badass and conveying emotion, and it turns out wonderfully.\n\nThe songwriting is confident and melodic, keeping in line with a fairly gloomy tone, but drawing out some surprisingly catchy choruses. 'Solitude' has an incredibly powerful hook, and works out to be the highlight of the album. There are not any weak tracks on the album, but I do feel with most of the tracks here that the choruses are made a little too important. The riffs are powerful, but when almost all of the hooks are thrown into the vocals, it can make for a one-sided memory, unless a listener is willing to sit down and let it truly sink in. As it stands, I have no problem calling 'Epicus Doomicus Metallicus' a classic. The style and direction of the band is very narrow however, and thus makes this album one I would only be able to appreciate fully when I am in the mood for something both gloomy and bombastic. Regardless, Candlemass introduced themselves in 1986 on a remarkable note.\n",
        "\nWhile I enjoy pretty much all Candlemass, there's something about this record that gets my dick harder, my neck sorer than all the others. The absence of knobhead Marcolin? The tendency towards spacier soundscapes? The bigger riffs? The drugged, hopeless dark atmosphere of the whole thing? The fresh way it constantly references Sabbath without being shit/derivative? Well, it's not hard to rationalise my love for the album.\n\nThe absence of Marcolin's probably the biggest plus, personally. Always tended to view him as a self important ass-bandit which is reflected in his vocal delivery; and while I normally loathe Ozzy impersonators Bjorn's really solid and deliver in pretty much every song, Cyclo-F being a bit of a cringe inducing exception. Droid's full of great vocal lines, and the quiet, haunting delivery of Tot (probably my favourite song here) brilliantly fits the uncharacteristically quiet, sombre verses. The dude doesn't blow my mind and isn't technically awesome but he gets the job done in every single song and never sounds out of place, never does crap songs about Samaritans or Seven Silver Keys, so on. So it's less \"he's great\" and more \"he never sounds like shit\"? Well, yeah. Dude is consistently solid...\n\n...Which is good because the way I've always viewed Candlemass and most doom in general is that you're generally ignoring the vocals for the huge ass riffs and vast, crushing atmosphere, and here that's delivered with aplomb. The whole thing's far closer to Sabbath (might be the vocalist) than most Candlemass is, although it's still a good deal darker and more visceral than the forefathers' work. Obvious Electric Funeral influence in almost every riff; not a bad thing! Things do a get a bit close to plagarism with Elephant Star's \"hey guys we think Symptoms of the Universe has a cool main riff\", but no big deal; if you're gonna rip off a riff you might as well make it a really good one. So many good riffs and guitar work here in general; Droid's catchy as hell main riff, the lost-in-space drift of Tot, the slow crusher that's Galatea. Far moreso than ever before the band is content to take things down to very deep, quiet tones- I think they're really good at it. Arguably a bit simpler and more stripped back than most Candlemass, but still, quality.\n\nThe whole thing just sounds really natural and un-forced; it sounds like what Candlemass wanted to do at the time. Even the drum solo in Cyclo-F fits?! Plus, the new (well, I assume it's new, I haven't heard Dactylis) found infusion of spacey synth times, the occaisonal tendency to drift among the stars on seas of delay just fits so naturally, so well into their sound. I really dig the way Candlemass approached the increased spaciness; it's not always subtle (Droid) but everytime it's really noticeable it's to the obvious improvement of the song. It's one of those experiments where you really have to wonder why they didn't follow up on it? Because it works and it works damn well, this pitch black atmosphere full of the primal emptiness of outer space.\n\nOverall it's just a really good album. Easy to lose yourself in. As good if not better than most of their works with Marcolin and Lowe; deserves listening to and buying if you're not a cheap bastard.\n",
        "\nI get it: Candlemass are a classic heavy metal band. One that specializes in \"epic doom\". I debated whether or not to criticize Epicus Doomicus Metallicus on its merits as plain heavy metal or to compare and contrast it with other earlier bands with a type of exact sound only to conclude that it makes no difference; this album doesn't do enough for me either way. Here's the kicker though: this band is really good at what they do and on this album they try to do more than enough to please traditionalists. I've gone and back and forth. Coaxing myself to get into this even self hypnosis. After all, it's not as if the band were \"trying too hard\". No, it's not that because these guys know what they are doing and have a goal. They got the heaviness down, that's for sure. And for some, the heaviness of the album is enough but I'll get to the \"heavy\" part soon. It's not for lack of identity either. No crisis one bit and they are a credit to their subgenre. I said that the band knows \"what they are doing\" in that they are trying to accomplish a really heavy, crushing doom sound (ala Black Sabbath) but taken in a more epic approach. And you know what? That's part of the problem. Where's the magic? Where is the sense of spontaneity that seems to accompany the songwriting found in other great doom metal albums? This album is too mapped out in accomplishing a majestic brooding heavy metal that while good at doing that, it seems to come at a price. \n\nUnlike Sabbath, Pentagram and Vitus, Candlemass seemingly drops that darkness driven pyschedelic blues sound in favor of a more classically based structure giving it that epic feel. The end result on this particular album is that it loses the colorfulness for me. There are a few awesome riffs to get giddy about but the album takes too long to get there and mostly Epicus Doomicus can get kind of boring while dooming in its own gloom because this album is supposed to be fun too. The band is singing about dark fantasy and witchery with an extra lugubrious undertaking than those other doom bands. And while that's nice and they do it well, in the end it doesn't make me feel or see anything as I hear it. If I read 'epic' before metal, I'm someone who will say \"show me the way!\" And although I can agree that this can be described as epic, it still disappoints. They dumped too many of the catchy headbanging rhythms. \n\nThe opening song Solitude is the one standout track that gets everything right and gets me banging my head out from open to close. This is a fun song to experience in such a way but once my head is emptied out, I'm left with the just that: solitude. As in holy shit, am I the only who realizes that Black Sabbath had a song with that very same title and that that song was smaller and better? Sabb's song titled Solitude actually made me feel lonely and depressed yet trippy too. I know there are those of you who are reading this and thinking 'why the hell do you persist in comparing Black Sabbath and other bands of their ilk to this (at the time) underground Swedish heavy metal band that was actually trying to do something a little unique with the sound?' Here's the rub: the song on here is rife with cool riffs and all (plus fun) but it is not stoned out enough to reinforce the melancholia. It doesn't subject you to anything except that the album is more an exercise in style (doomy melodic heaviness) with impressive epic fantasy lyrics. \n\nWhen you hear the sweeping acoustic guitar in Solitude, it gives way to the mournful operatic singer's voice and then comes in the devastating doom riff. It's very majestic and catchy right here and right way I know where the band will be drawing influence from. That would be of course Black Sabbath's tenth album. It's a beautiful thing. The 'earth to earth, ashes to ashes' chorus is sung so grandly and melodramatic and represents the band's successful career sound. There are a few other highlights found in the rest of the tracklist too but I couldn't help but wonder if the rest of the record was a one trick pony. This is because the band stays at an all too consistent tempo throughout which makes it sound predictable at times. It becomes a little tired as if they are too satisfied to stay with one agenda in establishing trademark heaviness. \n\nI noticed that the recording quality is quite clean and technical for such a debut. This isn't so much a problem for me but the way the lead and rhythm guitars are so evenly mixed, there really isn't much room for the bass to show off the wares as heavy doom metal should. The bass rhythms are there but its not very dominant. That slimming down might speak more towards the album's power metal leaning. You will however notice the four-string solo at the middle of Demon's Gate. Under the circumstances, it's pretty solid doomsmanship. You can almost hear it as if mumbling \"please let me go on.\" It was not to be. \n\nOne of the most interesting moments on EDM occurs in the song Under the Oak. It begins with an old school Sabbath chord and then the second guitar brings in a NWOBHM solo riff. This is all very awesome but I think by track's end it sums up why I didn't quite take to this record. It's got the powerful and crushing vibe but the momentum is interrupted when the middle of the song goes back to the slower epic vibe. In the case of A Sorcerer's Pledge, the reverse seems to apply: the soft majestic acoustic opening with the singer wailing about imprisonment in some cursed keep. Much like Solitude, the heavy doom lead arises like a vampire out the crypt at dusk. The presence here is a little faster and more aggressive so maybe its more intense than the opening track. The song is also too long and goes all cheesy at the end with power metal like synths and a kooky choir. \n\nWhat I'm left with is wonderful talent and fortitude by the band to develop some fun and crushing heaviness but there is that feeling that Candlemass had to be heavier and work harder at it than their more experienced English counterparts to accomplish that goal. Speaking of which, who looks to Sweden for doom metal anyhow? And I mean this in the most amicable way possible: what the fuck do these Swede metallers got to be so bummed out about? I still have never seen an ugly Swedish dame or chap. Hmm..what else? Sweden got to stay out of the World Wars. They enjoy the highest standard of living per capita in the world. England on the other hand..well, there's good reason why heavy metal came from there. My point is that doom metal works out best from some sort of weird contextual background and while Candlemass' motive to \"doom\" on this album are castles, curses and spells, Black Sabbath or Witchfinder General can more effortlessly find satirical commentary in heaviness out of a country that suffered Vikings, Cromwell, the Ripper and the Blitz (not to mention class distinction and the Irish) in a way that's more natural and authentic to effuse such rock and roll as this. When you get down to all these classic doom bands, that just may be the difference why this Candlemass record is missing something for me against an album like Death Penalty or Sabotage. It's HEAVY but it ain't 'eavy, dig it? Occasionally it moves like British doom will and other times it has me screaming 'aye c'mon 'Mass, move your bloomin' arse!' \n\nYou figure if that's the case, then wouldn't that apply to the rest of Candlemass' output? The answer is no. It just took the band alot longer to inspire me with their brand before they put out a great album which eventually they did. It's not to be found here just yet. If you can listen to Epicus Doomicus on vinyl, then you should do it because I found that this album sounds much better on that format. While it doesn't change my overall opinion on the music, I found the power metal type percussion more acclimated to the warmer sound as well as the relatively modern production quality allowing the sheer crushing riffs a better springboard when the recording is laid down for the needle to groove in whereas on tape or CD it sounded like the guitars were plugged into Orange amps. \n\nMany who have this album will have bonus tracks included that are live cuts. I have never seen this band in concert but hearing them I came away with the impression that if they played one of their great songs like Solitude on stage, the band can get boring after awhile with a setlist consisting of these early albums lessers. If you like classic heavy/doom metal I'm sure you have this album. 1986 was a banner year in metal and this offers something slower in the more epic manner after Black Sabbath parted ways with Ronnie Dio but it is not essential. Messiah will come.\n",
        "\nWell, here we are again, folks. Considering they were the first metal band I ever listened to, it's quite appropriate to come back to them after all this time. The last time I wrote a review for a Candlemass album was about three years ago. That was for \"Ancient Dreams\", and I am considering writing a new review of said record to coincide with these upcoming reviews of their other classic albums.\n\nNot to digress, however. In terms of influence, power, and compositional excellence, Nightfall in its greatest moments is up there with the likes of Painkiller, Piece of Mind, Somewhere In Time, Master of Puppets, Peace Sells, and many other famous metal albums. At the same time, it's not a patch on its predecessor, frequently going way over the top into levels of cheese not rivaled until Painkiller came along. And that was by Judas Priest, so it wasn't so unexpected. Here, it's like Sabbath mixed with the worst excesses of Maiden, and a hint of Rainbow and Dio - all fantastic, but sometimes taken way too far.\n\nThat's not to say it isn't an excellent album. On it are four of Candlemass's most well known and highly regarded songs - The Well of Souls, At The Gallows' End, Samarithan, and Bewitched. There's also Dark are the Veils of Death, which is also pretty popular amongst the band's fans, and Mourner's Lament, probably the only less well known song on the album. Unfortunately, strength after strength doesn't change a few fundamental things that, in my opinion, make this album a lot weaker than Epicus.\n\nFirst, there's Messiah Marcolin. His operatic delivery works wonders on many songs. Unfortunately, both he and in particular this record (far more so than the two that followed, interestingly) suffer from what I call the Dickinson syndrome. Don't get me wrong, Bruce Dickinson is a great singer. But he also had that tendency to go way overboard, making some songs painfully cheesy to endure. Notably, it's taken me several years to even listen to Aces High, and I didn't actually like it until just a few months ago - most of which is related to Bruce's performance. This is more than a lack of subtlety; it's disdain for the very concept. \n\nAnd Messiah often does the exact same thing, throwing himself so far into his roles that he ends up looking silly. On this record, the only time this element doesn't matter is when the songs benefit from extreme cheesiness - Bewitched being a good example. Other times, it's just plain embarrassing.\n\nThis isn't a new problem either. Ever since I got into Candlemass, I remember listening to parts of Nightfall, Ancient Dreams and Tales of Creation after immersing myself in the crowning glory of metal majesty that is Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, and fervently wishing that Johan Langqvist had stayed on instead. Like Bruce, Messiah goes into the highest registers imaginable too often for my liking. When he sings deeper or more mid-range, it's so much better. Johan had a slightly less powerful high than Messiah, but his low intonations were incredibly strong - without being cheesy. It's for this reason that I've always preferred the first album.\n\nOn the other hand, this record and the two that followed wouldn't be what they are without Messiah. His vocal style is still pretty unique, and there's no denying his talent. Indeed, some of the songs on here are truly amazing. Others, not so much.\n\nThe Well of Souls is a good example of a fantastic song, that nevertheless is for both better and worse ridiculously cheesy, and not in the manner of a song like Bewitched. With its mixture of grinding Sabbathian tones and aggressive, chugging riffage equally reminiscent of Maiden and Dio, plus a hint of Mercyful Fate and early thrash, it's a classic metal song with all the right elements. Unlike Epicus's monumental opener, though, it doesn't attempt even a single thoughtful moment. It's just crushing heaviness, evil riffs with middle-eastern overtones, and a totally over the top performance by the Mad Monk. No matter how good it is, when this song is played to the wrong audience or at the wrong time, it's so absurd that it stops being powerful and becomes laughable. Of particular notice is this part:\n\n\"Cold wind blows out the candles\nThe air grows cold and threatening\nDark shadows wicked laughter\nBrings darkness to your heart\nBehold the Goat of Mendes\nRed burning evil eyes\nLord's prayer holy water\nJust faith can save you now\"\n\nErm...what? Is this some kind of Christian Metal parody? No, of course it isn't. I know that. But lyrics like this, especially the way they are delivered here, are quite ridiculous. This shouldn't matter, but I find that unless I'm drunk, it's hard to take the song seriously. What's being described is so horrific and evil that it couldn't possibly not be laughable when delivered in the manner that it is. It's even worse than that, though, because Messiah sings said passage in a ridiculously high register, over a fast paced middle eastern riff, with an extreme amount of emotion! \n\nSo, yeah. But for the most part, it works anyway, provided you're either listening to it through headphones on a dark evening, playing it through your car's CD player while driving to a satanic ritual, or rocking out with your mates at a very, very metal party. As for it working in any situation, at any time...well, just think about that one and I'll get back to you. But that applies to most metal anyway, so what the fuck. \n\nThe rest of the song is pretty reliable too: Lars Johansson's solo is cool, nothing great, but far from bad. Then we get the chugging riffage which is just a bit too thrashy for a doom band, and it works, but it sounds a little odd with the album's guitar tone. Then the breakdown: powerful, heavy, and Sabbathian. Though, whenever I hear it I get this image in my mind of Messiah doing his \"doom stomp\" which, again, is amusing, but perhaps too much so. Then comes the part that's supposed to be really \"evil\". \"Disharmony...satanic, serenade! Black symphony! A tribute, to the plague!\" Uh, yeah. It's times like this when I think of Candlemass as a more Spinal Tap-esque band than anything else. Unless listening to it while drunk, of course.\n\nI'm not sure what they were going for here...either trying to sound cool, genuinely scary, or just be metal as fuck. For the record, in this case they only succeeded in the latter, but that's no bad thing. The song ends soon after this, following a repeat of the verse, chorus, and bridge, and fades out.\n\nNow, on a fundamental level, as well as a purely musical one, this is a great song. Unfortunately, it's so over the top and cheesy that it makes Mercyful Fate's first two records and even parts of Painkiller seem normal in comparison. Well, ok, not really. Messiah isn't anywhere near as outrageous as King Diamond, and Rob Halford's singing is often far more cheesy. I've got mixed feelings on it, to be honest. It's awesome really, but a little subtlety could have gone a long way into making it more dynamic.\n\nThe rest of the record continues in a similar vein - attempts to either be evil and/or sinister, or to be morose, doomy and depressing, or in one case, somewhat uplifting as well as sad. This is intermingled with silly little interludes, such as the utterly pointless \"Codex Gigas\" which does absolutely nothing, Gothic Stone, which is the intro to The Well of Souls, Marche Funebre, which is a cover of the famous Funeral March by Frederic Chopin, and finally Black Candles, which is a fittingly, and actually effectively creepy closer. In between these are various tales of death, pain, sacrifice, doom, sorrow, and evil that at times do create a pretty palpable atmosphere. \n\nAs a whole, though, this record doesn't work for me the way Epicus does, or the way Ancient Dreams and Tales of Creation do. The biggest reason for that, which I've barely touched on so far, is that it's just too depressing.\n\nNightfall isn't a concept album. However, nearly every song featured on it revolves around death. The Well Of Souls is about some priest trying to stop the evil dead rising out of the \"black hole to hell\", which is pretty objectively ghastly. At The Gallows' End is about an execution. Samarithan is about one good man's life and how he then dies and goes to heaven - positive, but he still dies, and I don't have much faith in Christian ideas about the afterlife. Dark Are The Veils Of Death is about, guess what, death! Mourner's Lament is about a man mourning his dead child. Can you think of anything more depressing? Oh yeah, and we've also got Bewitched, which is about Satan luring some poor dude to his doom, proclaiming \"no one will see you again! Muahahahahaha!\" minus the evil laughter. Not exactly full of joy and light, now is it?\n\nPerhaps that's the point of doom metal. Many people would say it is, and I imagine most doomsters would too. I don't really agree though, and in that case, if an album like Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is less of a pure doom album for having more variety, then so much the better. If Nightfall could do all these things and still be as epic as its predecessor, none of this would matter so much. Which brings us rather nicely to my next point: the \"epic\" element in Candlemass's music and metal in general, or in this case, the lack thereof.\n\nThis is one of the biggest issues I have with the album. There are two genuine epics here, The Well of Souls and Samarithan. I've already talked about the former. The latter is far less cheesy, which to me proves that Messiah is better at singing emotional songs than evil ones. However, I wouldn't say that any of the other four real songs on Nightfall are really \"epic\", especially when compared with what followed or with the preceding record.\n\nThe other three classics on here are a mixed bag. At the Gallows' End is considered by many Candlemass fans to be their best song ever. I strongly disagree. Like a lot of stuff on here, it is often very cheesy due to Messiah's delivery of his lyrics. Additionally, there's a fair amount of Christian bullshit to be found here, which is also scattered throughout the rest of the album, and to a mostly lesser degree its two successors. Here, we have a song in which the main character is being killed for...what? \"Drinking to the Devil with Servants\"? What the hell is wrong with that? \n\nMoreover, what does it even mean? Sacrificing a virgin to the devil, yeah, that's indeed questionable, if only because it's murder. But what even is drinking to the devil? That the man feels he deserves to be executed just for being a Satanist, to me, reeks of apologist Catholic bollocks from Messiah's upbringing. I strive to respect the rights of individuals to believe what they wish so long as they do not force their beliefs on others. But I can't and won't respect, nor stand for bullshit.\n\nThis doesn't ruin the song, but I don't think it was that great to begin with. It's also far too speedy. It's not epic either, and it's a rather tired concept, used far better by a classic band that had at least some influence on Candlemass's more epic side - Iron Maiden with Hallowed by Thy Name, obviously. That worked, because it was subtle, in its own unique way. This isn't, it's just some Christian nonsense that says, basically, if you disobey the rules of the church, you deserve to be hanged. Hell, if you even toast to the devil with your mates, you're pure black evil and deserve to die horribly because you're a sinner! Oh yeah! No more of those sins baby! \n\nIn the words of Dr. Evil...Riiiiiiiiiight.\n\nDark are the Veils of Death is, apparently, another Candlemass classic. Again, I compare it to Under the Oak, to Mirror Mirror, to Darkness in Paradise, to Ancient Dreams, to Dark Reflections, to Where the Runes still Speak, and this just doesn't cut it. Like a lot of the songs on Nightfall it's very cheesy. Even worse, it tries to be groovy, bluesy, evil, thrashy, and doomy all at once, which is an overblown mixture of ideas so different that they couldn't possibly all work in the same song. Yet that's what they did, throwing in a blues like opening riff as the intro, then speeding up to a groovy riff that's designed for headbanging. Is that the purpose of doom? \n\nThe next riff is speedy, almost like thrash, and all this is interspersed with some silly lyrics about \"passing to the other side\" by Messiah. Again, I ask, is this Candlemass or is it Spinal Tap? Seriously, Candlemass accidentally parody themselves, metal, rock, and the whole doom genre so many times on this album that one has to wonder if it was accidental. Perhaps they were trying to be tongue in cheek here, feeling that Epicus was too serious, so it would be better to create an album with even darker undertones, yet put such an absurd spin on it with ridiculous lyrics, cheesy delivery by an nevertheless very talented singer, and overly obvious riffs that it would be funny. Yeah, funeral doom rock, or metal with a humour slant. Great idea, guys. I laughed so hard when I first heard some of these songs that I nearly shat myself. Not.\n\nI must apologise for all of the sarcastic potshots I'm taking here. I really do love Candlemass, they are actually one of my favourite bands of all time. Epicus, Ancient Dreams, Tales of Creation and Chapter VI are all fantastic records. And Nightfall, objectively, is certainly a very good record at the least. It just doesn't work for me as well as the others do.\n\nSo yeah, Dark are the Veils of Death was never a favourite of mine. It just doesn't feel like the kind of thing that a band like Candlemass should be doing, really. Too thrashy, too groovy, trying too hard to be sinister, and with rather ridiculous lyrics.\n\nBefore I come to Bewitched, I'll quickly go over Mourner's Lament, which is feel is rather underrated. Again, Messiah goes way overboard in his vocal delivery, but considering what the song is about - a father losing his child - it's actually warranted this time. Not only that, but the riffs are great, pure doom here, crushing, dark, sad, and ever so slightly creepy without being too cheesy. Lars' solo is also fantastic, filled with emotion, and a strong neo-classical feel. If only they played this song more often, and not Dark are the Veils of Death or At the Gallows' End all the time.\n\nAnd now we come to Bewitched, one of Candlemass's most popular songs ever, and with good reason - it rocks. It's one of those songs that shouldn't work, but somehow just does. The lyrics are genuinely evil, and yes, if you watch the video, it's funny. In fact, it's fucking hilarious. This time, however, I feel like I'm laughing with the band rather than at them.\n\nI'm pretty sure that they knew when they made it that the video would be very amusing. Messiah is very charismatic here, his performance is genuinely quite evil in terms of the vocal delivery. \"So take my hand, and understand, that no one will see you again!\" Yes, it works. Perhaps also because it's fairly slow, grinding, and deliberate, and revels in its own humourous side rather than trying to be deadly serious.\n\nSo, that's Candlemass's second album. A doom landmark, to be sure, even if not on the same level as Epicus. The parts that work really do work. It's unfortunate that the opposite is also true, which is not something shared with their first, third, or fourth records.\n\nIf it seems like I've come down pretty hard on this album, well, I guess I have. One of the four interludes here sucks, two of the songs barely work for me at all, one can work but is oh so cheesy, but the other three are all great in their own ways. So, the score? \n\nWell, to me, 86 is pretty fair considering that the stuff here that's good is really damn good. The weaker songs aren't actually bad as much as they are either absurd and cheesy or filled with annoying lyrics and overly speedy riffs. There's nothing actually horrible here. Just some irritating stuff that could have been great if it was done differently.\n\nAnd that sums up Nightfall pretty well. A very good album overall, with some fantastic songs, but also lumbered by many problems that the first album lacked, and that the next two would attempt, and mostly succeed, thankfully, to fix. So many fans would disagree here, but again, I suppose that just shows that I prefer my doom the way it was originally made - slow, grinding and crushing, with its epic elements having an emphasis on the \"broadly epic\" as opposed to the \"fast\". Cases in point: everything that followed. \n\nNevertheless, it's a classic album, and one well worth owning if you like Sabbath, Maiden, Priest, Dio, Rainbow, or Mercyful Fate - or, for that matter, Trouble, Saint Vitus, Witchfinder General, or Pentagram. At its best, Nightfall, like Candlemass's albums in general, combines the doom and gloom of Sabbath and their other sucessors with the epic stylings of Maiden, Priest, Dio and Rainbow, and some of the evil and over the top absurdity of Mercyful Fate, and fuses them together in a way that just plain works. \n\nTo sum up, despite its problems, this record is still essential to any Candlemass or doom fan. Just skip tracks 4 and 7, and have plenty to drink before listening to 2 - trust me, you'll need it.\n\n\"You are Bewitched...\"\n",
        "\nBeing a huge Candlemass fan, I was exited to discover that they have released an EP of two covers of classic songs. The first song is obviously Blue Oyster Cult's smash hit \"Don't Fear the Reaper.\" The second is Bob Dylan's fantastic \"All Along the Watchtower.\" While not exactly bad, these covers aren't really anything all that amazing. To be honest, this kind of feels like a filler EP. \n\n\"Don't Fear the Reaper\" doesn't stray to far from the original. There are a few changes: the song's trademark cowbell is omitted and there is distortion added to the guitars. During the verses Robert's voice is nice and melodic, which suits the song perfectly. The vocals that fade in and out during the chorus are a bit boring, though. One thing that really bugs me about this cover is that they fucked up the bridge. It lacks the overwhelming power of the original and it doesn't last long enough for it to have any effect. While this cover is adequate, one would expect Candlemass covering a rock'n'roll classic to be more inspiring.\n\nTheir cover of \"All Along the watchtower\", is a bit lacking. After hearing the vocals of this song, I kind of wish that they covered this while Messiah was still in the band. The vocals are much deeper than on the first cover and have hints of Dio, Hetfield and if you listen carefully, you might even detect vague traces of Bob Dylan's nasally whine. The rhythm guitarist sounds like he is kind of bored; nothing all that spectacular goes on there. There is some pretty cool shredding, but unfortunately they don't know when to stop and it gets to the point where it is excessive. This can stand up to neither Dylan or Hendrix.\n\nFrankly, my favorite thing about this release is the artwork. Sure the same sort of thing has been done a lot by other bands, but it is still pretty cool. When it comes to the actual music, I can't help but feel they could have done a lot better. This doesn't sound very inspired. These don't compare to the originals. Sure, they are competent, but in the end they come off as a bit unnecessary.\n",
        "\nThis is a LOOONG overdue rewrite.\n\nEpicus was the first album review that I had ever done. That was a couple of years ago and I was a bit of an overzealous newbie to this fine establishment. I will always love this album. Not much choice, really. You see, the ink of my one and only tattoo (the impaled skull of EDM) was still drying on my right outer calf muscle whilst I was frantically heaping loads and loads of zeal onto this disc. I've had two years to think about it and the rage of my hard-on has subsided, albeit just a wee bit. I'd like to thank the 'Saab Rules' (hilarious title, mate) for helping to curb my enthusiasm. However, I can still thank this (and a shitload of other doom albums) for rescuing me from a stagnant sea of death metal where I was drowning in entropy. \n\nIn the foul year of our lord 1986, Earth was a very heavy place to be. Slayer and Megadeth (fuck Master!) unleashed their respective masterpieces unto the world, Maiden was in the midst of their \"classic era\", Celtic Frost, Sodom, and Possessed were busy building the framework for death and black metal, and these dudes from Sweden come along and heave their massive debut onto the metallic table with authority.\n\nEpicus Doomicus Metallicus may well be the most aptly-named heavy metal record to date, for it is just that. With thrash approaching fruition and the embryonic death metal genre beginning to spread its morbid wings, the need for speed was ever-present. \n\nFortunately, Candlemass came forth and proved once and for all that you DO NOT have to play fast to be heavy. From the first notes of \"Epicus...\", these artists create a foreboding atmosphere of depression, misanthropy, and longing for death. Perhaps the most unfortunate detail of this album is that this would be the first and final appearance of baritone Johann Lanquist. His performance on this album is absolutely spellbinding. He is obviously a trained musician, singing from the diaphragm, projecting each perfectly decipherable syllable toward the heavens. There is much to be said for metal bands with all cleanly sung vocals. If you ever find yourself drowning in a world of cookie monsters and guttural barks, consider this classic. \n\nThese songs are expertly structured for all fans of anything that is heavy. Production is clear, crisp, and, frankly, immaculate, considering the release date. In the current age of pro-tools, gridding, and other such studio magic (a.k.a. lies), we are fortunate to have the choice to travel back in time to analog recordings such as this opus that were made for long-haired, poseur-stomping, dope smoking metal-heads. Simply put, this is genre-definitive heavy metal.\n\nAll right, so if the ethereal darkness of \"Solitude\" (I still like this Solitude better than the Sab's simply for the sake of headbanging) doesn't do you in, just wait till the double bass drums pummel your guts on \"Demon's Gate\". Goddamn! This is where things start to get nice and heavy, and let's not forget the awesome and evil spoken word intro to the song. Pure morbidity. I now will raise the chalice of metal excellence to drummer Matz Ekstroem. He does his job with mastery and the utmost class. He is the ideal percussionist for this band, or for heavy metal in general, and it is tragic that this would be his last studio appearance with Candlemass. This is crystalline drum performance and production. The rack toms sing out beautifully, the floor toms are rich and deep, and again, the tastefully-executed double kicks will smash your fuckin' balls. \n\n\"Black Stone Wielder\" is everything I could ever want from any metal song - it is a perfect song. The 6/8 opening riff is darkly ponderous and cunning and it obviously inspired many bands such as Opeth. Its gravity pulls the listener into a world of sorcery and sheer aesthetic metal beauty. My favorite riff on the album is in this song, starting at 3:22. It reminds me of the opening riff of \"Into The Void\" if it were being covered by a band of elder gods. Plodding, archaic, and triumphant, it eloquently sets the stage for the dreamy and neo-classical guitar solo, also my fave on the album. \n\nOh, and there's two other songs. They're pretty good, too.\n",
        "\nAnd finally here it is\u2026the long awaited first live output by doom giants with the amazing vocals of Robert Lowe in front of the mic. What does this has to offer? To put it lightly and simple: a good concert but not the ultimate live offering I have been waiting for. I am going to tell you why I took 15 points out of 100 and why I even gave it a lower score than the other guy.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing to discuss about Rob\u2019s performance. He has been, is and most likely will be the best singer this genre has to offer. Granted, the classics \u2018Solitude\u2019, \u2018A sorceress pledge\u2019, \u2018At the gallows end\u2019 do not reach the rank of the originals on this album but the rendition of these is quite good. Nevertheless, it is actually here where the points go down but more on this later on. On the bright side (if you can say that for Candlemass) is the interaction between Rob and the crowd, he encourage them to sing the choruses, he talks to them which is really nice. You can see he loves the stage. \n\nThe production is ALMOST stellar. Unfortunately the guitars are too buried in the mix and you can tell this by listening to both the audio and watching the DVD. You can hardly listen to Johansson\u2019s solos because of the power of the bass and drums. The vocals are on top and they sound crisp and powerful but mostly, desperate and angry. What I like the most is the crystal clear sound of the album as a piece. As the other guy appointed, this live audio cd resembles a studio album with unpolished production and I agree. Sadly, some of the mistakes on this department really decrease this from being what I had waited for.\n\nThere is no point summarizing the songs. Any Candlemass song is great although I am not bond to \u2018Samarithan\u2019 (from this set list). \u2018Kill the King\u2019 is mmm\u2026well, a great song, let\u2019s face it but I honestly don\u2019t like what they did here. It is a good cover but it lost its rock vibe due to the rendition. Either way, why would they pick up this song? Sorry, but I hate Rainbow and all those 70\u2019s rock bands (a friend of mine\u2019s fault). It is a pity we miss songs from the spectacular \u2018Candlemass\u2019 album from 2005, beginning with \u2018Black Dwarf\u2019 but it is a \u2018blessing\u2019 to listen to \u2018Bleeding Baroness\u2019 and \u2018Hammer of doom\u2019 with its Sabbath-esque slow & doomy riffs. \u2018Emperor of the void; is a kick ass fast song with really high screams from Rob. \u2018If I ever die\u2019 is what I think the best performed song here since it resembles the original SO much! \n\nNow let me tell you what I think screws this up from getting a higher score: 1. The guitars (as mentioned above) are too low in the mixing. The solos can hardly being heard not to mention the slashing rhythm sections. 2. This takes me to (so far my favorite song from the band) \u2018At the gallows end\u2019 where the powerful main riff is completely buried. It is really sad because this is the perfect opportunity to head bang again after \u2018If I ever die\u2019 but you cannot hear the riffs. 3. There is a mistake on \u2018A Sorcerers pledge\u2019 around 9:20min. mark where they lose time because the drummer went ahead one microsecond, thus for about 5 seconds they are lost. Too bad because it is an amazing song and being this is kind of slow music it is a shame that more than 20years later they lose track. Sorry but I needed to really appoint this because I know all bands make mistakes on stage but never thought I\u2019d listen to this with these guys. 4. The guitar solo from \u2018Solitude\u2019 with its original desperate feeling and reverb used completely LOST everything with Johansson\u2019s performance here. He played entirely different so it doesn\u2019t go with this song. It is really sad but he MUST have played the way it was original conceived and played. I know within the digipak version of \u2018King of the Grey Islands\u2019 they re-recorded it using Rob\u2019s vocals but I haven\u2019t heard it, so I guess they changed the guitar solo. In any case, they totally screwed an otherwise superior and anthem doom song.\n\nPerhaps I am being too picky and punishing too much but hey, I am a fan and I am purchasing all the albums and I was eagerly waiting for this live cd. I love the approach of the band and I love the daylight open concert more than the other night smaller concert. Even so, I am taking 5 points for every single mistake I found (which are 4) because as an experience it is quite good. Nevertheless, with so many albums on their back catalog I am missing some other songs from Ancient Dreams or Tales of Creation but I guess this is due to this being a multi festival and not just their tour so I am not punishing that. Candlemass\u2019 curse carries on!\n",
        "\nSwedish doom metal masters Candlemass offer up a live s\u00e9ance-like effort of live proportion in its recent release Ashes to Ashes. It\u2019s an hour-long somberness that delivers exactly what you might expect from a band of the Candlemass echelon. Recorded at the Sweden Rock Fest last year, Ashes spreads out over the plains (of your room, no doubt) like a caustic shroud of thick hellish smoke. \n\nI know it\u2019s the ultimate sacrilege to say it, but here goes: I prefer Robert Lowe to Messiah Marcolin all day long. Maybe it\u2019s the lack of total theatrics in Lowe\u2019s delivery; in fact, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it in a nutshell. I loved Lowe\u2019s work in Solitude (Aeturnus) and for me his vocal is akin to Lee Dorian, Eric Wagner and Ronnie James Dio in that it just soars effortlessly, painlessly without need for over-exuberance or pretense. When he sings it\u2019s just that, a vocalization conducive to the underlying music and it\u2019s a perfect fit. He handles both old and new songs with relative ease, as well he should being a seasoned veteran himself.\n\nThe band is on, man, flawlessly plowing through new soon-to-be classics like \u201cIf I Ever Die\u201d and \u201cThe Bleeding Baroness\u201d with all of the tenacity of an eighteen-year-old boy at Glamourcon. The production is sharp and full, adding a lush layer of bass accordingly as you take in a terrific mix of guitars and drums happily co-existing. There\u2019s of course ample respect paid to the classics in the Candlemass arsenal as well, including emotionally dismantling versions of \u201cSolitude\u201d, \u201cAt the Gallows End\u201d and one hell of a cover version of Rainbow\u2019s \u201cKill the King\u201d - the last three live albums I reviewed that were this resonating were the Onslaught and Exodus records. The crowd sounds somewhat enthusiastic, but it\u2019s hard to really gauge it from the audio portion, but it doesn\u2019t matter since Candlemass was there to provide the ultimate down experience in the most uplifting manner possible.\n\nWhen I hear Ashes to Ashes it doesn\u2019t even sound like a live album so much as an under-polished studio album, which is pretty good considering how many bands can\u2019t seal the deal in a live setting. It all seems too easy, but with great talent comes the bosom of comfort ability. I am glad Candlemass is still kicking around the doom tunes for as long as they have now. These upstarts in the doom genre can use a blueprint from which to build, and Candlemass is the design.\n\n(Originally written for www.MetalPsalter.com)\n",
        "\nStranded without music and with a riff from the excellent 'Ancient Dreams' pounding insistently through my head, I ducked into a CD shop and came out with Dactylis Glomerata. I'd never listened to the album before and while I knew it wouldn't stack up to such awesome stuff as 'Cry from the Crypt' or 'Epistle 81', I was curious to see how it compared against Abstrakt Algebra 'II' and other such Lief Edling material.\n\nWell, it was a huge disappointment. The album largely consists of inferior takes of Abstrakt Algebra songs, burdened with an ill-fitted heaviness that Edling's (initially thoroughly apologetic, later brazenly defensive) liner notes suggest was imposed as a condition of the music's release. The riffs are boring and the songs seem cheaply built around a binary structure that leaves them over-familiar nearly as soon as they've begun. Of course we all understand that it was impossible to retain Messiah Marcolin but the vocals here are really dire - monotonous chanting with the occasional grate for emphasis. Some actual singing with even a hint of a possibility of a variation in pitch might have made this a sad, but listenable 60%.\n\n'I Still See the Black' might have been passable, were it not for the shocking keyboard sound that heralds the transition from mordant (if mindless) doom drudgery to apparently some kind of faery picnic. Not impressed. Similarly, 'Dustflow' seems to promise some kind of epic acoustic voyage with a shreddin' denouement and instead we get an interminable buildup with no release and some very naive lyrics about children playing. No thankyou.\n\nOn 'Molotov', Edling's league of captive musicians creates what really should have been the new Candlemass sound (a good example of a tendency I can best describe as 'Road Warrior') before applying some godawful phase distortion that brings home the fact that yes, this is for whatever reason a terrible album.\n\nI tend to view all latter-day Lief Edling - Candlemass projects with mixed feelings; Krux has its moments and new, Rob Lowe-era Candlemass, while by no means as intelligent as it once was, is okay. This album is execrable and I pity anyone who bought it without the bonus copy of the Abstrakt Algebra 'II' album which is at least interesting and original. Basically it's not Candlemass and it's a pity the band elected to allow its release as such.\n",
        "\nWhile Candlemass may always be remembered for housing vocalists such as Messiah Marcolin and Robert Lowe in their ranks, they were one of many bands that kept pushing through the 90's and giving the die-hards left some good quality material. This particular album is one of the three released during this time period and is the last to feature guitarist Mats St\u00e5hl, drummer Jejo Perkovic, and vocalist Bj\u00f6rn Flodkvist. It's also the only Candlemass album to feature a keyboardist in the form of Carl Westholm and was what paved the way for a reunion of the band's signature line-up.\n\nMusically, this album features the band's familiar tempos and but focuses on a different aspect of doom metal than what the group is usually known for. The atmosphere is incredibly dark, the riffs are incredibly slow and packed with sludge, and there appears to be more of a \"jamming\" feel on here in comparison to other Candlemass efforts. There is also an incredibly spacy feel to the album with this tone being reinforced by the spooky keyboard efforts and strange song titles.\n\nAs many listeners (and the booklet's liner notes) have pointed out, Black Sabbath is the most dominating influence on this album's songwriting and band performance. \"Tot\" has a foreboding feel similar to that of \"Black Sabbath,\" the driving \"Elephant Star\" is similar to \"Symptom Of The Universe,\" and \"Arx/NG 891\" has some shades of \"Electric Funeral\" in its atmosphere. While this could have turned out horribly and shamefully derivative in the hands of a lesser band, Candlemass executes its tributes in good taste and adds in a lot of unique elements to keep things interesting.\n\nThe band's performance is also quite solid and goes along with the album's loose nature quite nicely. When taking the Sabbath influence into consideration, it is needless to say that the guitars are almost always running the show. While the riffs sometimes lack variation, they are always solid in their plodding nature and the solos provide some decent touches here and there. Flodkvist also puts in a decent Ozzy Osbourne impression though his somewhat nasally tone keeps him short of the Wino levels of success. I also like how the drums appear to be more prominent than usual and are given a nice chance to shine in the midst of \"Cyclo-F.\"\n\nI also found the lyrics to be pretty intriguing with most of them being about as odd as their titles would suggest. Most of the songs seem to center around themes related to fantasy and science fiction though \"Cyclo-F\" throws out an incredibly sarcastic set of rhymes that seem to play off the classic doom metal stereotypes. They even manage to bring in a William Blake reference for the opening lines of \"Arx/NG 891.\"\n\nWhile this isn't on the same level as some of their more famous efforts, this is a pretty solid slab of doom metal worth checking out for anyone who calls themselves a fan. It may actually be a good introduction to the band for unfamiliar listeners that already enjoy classic Black Sabbath and should be a great bonus for those that have already been initiated.\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Droid,\" \"Tot,\" \"Elephant Star,\" \"Arx/NG 891,\" and \"Cyclo-F\"\n",
        "\n1986 was one of the biggest years for heavy metal with many major releases such as Metallica's Master of Puppets and Slayer's Reign in Blood. These are albums that are recognised by every metal fan in the world whether they like them or not. While Candlemass' debut album isn't as well known as the aforementioned albums, it is no doubt it made a contribution to heavy metal as great as them for being one of the major influences in doom metal.\n\nEpicus Doomicus Metallicus is a doom metal album that's dark, depressive, powerful, dynamic, heavy and of course, epic! These descriptions together makes this one hell of an album. All six tracks on this album are fantastic. They all stick out equally well and there are absolutely no fillers in sight. This is a challenge for any artist writing an album but Candlemass knew how many songs this album needed and gave each one their own characteristics while keeping their style intact all the way through. Six may not be a lot but it doesn't feel like there's a song or two missing in this album at all.\n\nThis was the only album to feature Johan L\u00e4ngqvist on vocals and it's a shame he left so soon. He has a very powerful voice and it's loud and clear. He shows a lot of energy and emotions all the way through. It makes you wish his metal career didn't end right there. Despite that, Messiah Marcolin is still a fantastic singer and did even better for the band later on. However, he doesn't sing the songs on Epicus Doomicus Metallicus as well as Johan did as shown on the live bonus disc included with the remastered version.\n\nThe guitars are another strong point to this album. The riffs are very heavy, dark and give out a depressive feel to go with this album. Solitude and Under the Oak and the intro to Black Stone Wielder are some badass riffs and even have a Black Sabbath vibe to them which makes perfect sense considering they are one of the major influences on Candlemass. The solos are also worth noting, especially Crystal Ball and Black Stone Wielder where they show some great emotions and make a great deal of the songs they belong to.\n\nThe bass performance by Leif Edling is fantastic. It's audible throughout and stands out as its own character in the music as well which is a sign of a strong bassist. His best performance is in Demons Gate where he gets an excellent spotlight halfway through. Alongside with the guitars, it is undeniable that it adds a great factor to the heaviness of this album.\n\nThe drums also do good with the album for the excellent rhythm to bang your head to these awesome songs. There's even some spotlights for the drumming, especially in A Sorcerer's Pledge where it's given a great chance to show a good beat with a reasonable tempo and to prove its worthiness for the whole album.\n\nEach song knows how to make a great introduction, especially the acoustic depressive piece at the start of Solitude and the crushing riffs in Black Stone Wielder. The only intro that doesn't do as well is Demons Gate, You hear a demonic voice who talks about entering the demons gate which sounds rather odd. It would have made more sense if the voice was welcoming you rather than saying \"I went into the demons gate\". That aside, it's still an interesting introduction to the song.\n\nThe endings are slightly less notable than the intros but that doesn't mean they're not amazing. A Sorcerer's Pledge ends it all off with the spine-shivering female choir that is not only a great closure to the song but also a brilliant closure to the whole album making you think \"Wow, what an album I just heard.\"\n\nThe last thing that comes to mind is the lyrics. Although this is coming from someone who focuses on lyrics the least in music, Candlemass do a good job at writing the lyrics to make the songs even more depressing, especially Solitude as well as telling an dark and epic story in Crystal Ball and A Sorcerer's Pledge. It may be clich\u00e9 here and there but overall, it works very well with the atmosphere of the entire album.\n\nIn conclusion, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is a masterpiece. Each and every song is epic, heavy and awesome and they're all equally recognisable to each other, thus making it a well balanced album. This is highly recommended to anyone who's a genuine metal fan whether your main interest is power, thrash, death or even traditional metal. If doom metal isn't really your cup of tea, it's still worth checking this album out. Who knows, this could spark your interest in doom metal because it's that good.\n",
        "\nLegend has it that Messiah Marcolin contacted Leif Edling after hearing \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus,\" telling Edling that he was going to be Candlemass' next singer. The rest is history. Aside from Edling and rhythm guitarist Mappe Bj\u00f6rkman, the lineup was entirely different from the one that recorded \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus.\" Mike Wead, who would become a guitarist in such varied acts as King Diamond and Marcolin's own Memento Mori, was a member for most of the sessions for this album, but was replaced at the last minute by Lars Johansson. One of Wead's instrumental compositions, \"Black Candles,\" appears at the end of the album.\n\nThe fact that four out of the album's ten tracks are either intros or interludes is a bit problematic. Momentum isn't really something that one would normally be concerned with on a doom album, but I wish that perhaps instead another song could be added to replace the two interludes in the middle.\n\nJan Lindh is an incredibly boring drummer. Matz Ekstr\u00f6m knew when to go along with the music, but also would open up on occasion with fine results (see \"Demons Gate\"). Lindh just uses simple drums beats throughout and certain parts (like after the solo in \"At The Gallows End\") suffer.\n\nMessiah Marcolin, despite having a powerful and charismatic voice, loves to go so over-the-top that at times his singing is either cringe-worthy or funny, depending on how you look at it (see \"Samarithan's\" \"Lots of food to eat...woah-oh-oh-woah\"). When coupled with heavy guitar riffs to bring the song back down to the ground, Marcolin's vocals work extraordinarily well. However, on some songs like \"Samarithan\" and \"Mourner's Lament,\" the guitars are dialed back and the singing is just too much to bear. \n\nHowever, on \"Well of Souls,\" that formula of heavy guitar riffs countered with Marcolin's operatic vocals is unbelievably successful. Leif Edling's vision of taking the groundwork that Black Sabbath laid and bringing it to a whole new level can be evidenced here. Also, who says all doom has to crawl forward at a snail's pace? \"At the Gallows End\" picks things up a bit and the chorus line \"Ring brother, ring for me/Ring the bells of hope and faith\" is just classic. Oh, and that riff after the verses? Pure gold. \"Bewitched\" is another song that is a grower, despite Marcolin again trying to be too dramatic. The guitars save this one. Be sure to watch the unintentionally hilarious video that they made for it.\n\nI may be in a minority here, but I can't help but wonder how much better this album would have been if Johan Langquist would have stayed in Candlemass instead of pursuing a career in pop music. Oh well, we still get a respectable doom album with more focus on the \"epic\" aspect and less of a focus on being heavy and crushing all in its path. The artwork for the album is excellent and can especially be appreciated if you have it on vinyl like I do. \"Nightfall\" comes with a recommendation, but to be honest, I prefer \"Epicus Doomicus Metallus\" and the albums that follow this.\n",
        "\nThere is so many good things to mention on this album that everytime I try to name just one of those things my tongue feels like it is dropping off. I'll try my best not to make that happen again!\n\nThe main focus in this album is Messiah Marcolin. The operatic doom metal icon who sings every phrase with 100% passion and adds vibrato anywhere he can, which is something everyone doesn't like and many people love. The way how Messiah joined this band is something that many singers don't have the courage to do. He phoned members of Candlemass several times and didn't get the chance to audition. So, he moved to the town where the band was located and told how things were done from now on and the next thing you know, he is the lead singer of Candlemass. The group loved his style and had no other choice than to make him the singer.\n\nNightfall was the first album I ever heard of this band and it was so good that I, among many other people thought that it couldn't get any better nor come even close. Still, I bought this album and put it on my record player just to be amazed and freezed to death. The atmosphere, the lyrical concepts, the mournful guitar riffs and the painfully slow drumwork made chills run down my spine. This album isn't as slow as Reverend Bizarre, nothing like that. But in it's own way, the heaviness and slowness of this album just feels unexplainably bigger.\n\nMessiah is the one who is \"in the centre\" of this album, meaning that he mostly defines how each song should make the listener feel. The operatic voice full of vibrato is so mournful and professional that it just makes you feel like everyone should now of this band. He even made ''Under the Oak'' sound really great. Not many singers could do that. I don't prefer it over the original version on ''Epicus Doomicus Metallicus'' but it is damn close if you ask me.\n\nThe guitar riffs are pretty much similar to the ones on Nightfall and it is only a positive thing. The solos are even more better and complex and if you need proof of that you can listen to the short instrumental doom metal track with a twist of power metal \"Into the Unfathomed Tower\" which fits the atmosphere and the theme perfectly. \n\nAfter the intro track which sets you in for the right mood, a thunderous riff begins the song ''Dark Relfections''. It is not neither stereotypical of a riff nor a piece of plagiarism - it is only heavy and perfect. That riff is a good way to open the album that feels like a ton of weights dropping on you.\n\nThis album is a concept album and it is done with thought and passion. The phrases on tracks called \"The Prophecy\" and \"Voices in the Wind\" will make you sure of that. Nothing seems out of place on this masterpiece. One could still say that this album is a \"grower\" meaning that the listener does not necessarily love this album at the first listen. After about 10 listens, this album became my obsession, I'll tell you that.\n\nThe highlights of this record are definetly \"Dark Reflections\", \"Into the Unfathomed Tower\" and \"Tears\". These songs are the ones that will most certainly get stuck in your head for ages as they did to me. These songs are certainly not like \"Solitude\", \"Bewitched\" or \"The Sorcerer's Pledge\" but they sure come close.\n\nI would reccomend this album to everyone who likes to listen to albums from start to finnish at one listen and to those who love doom metal with epic feelings. Hail Messiah Marcolin and Candlemass!\n",
        "\nThe titanic debut album from Candlemass is many things, the ultimate doom album being one of them. Almost perfect is another. To be honest I'm not sure what could really be better but I don't think there is a perfect album so I'll leave the score at 99. \n\nThis album while not the first doom album, see Sabbath for that, it is the single best example of the genre I've ever heard. Everything about it moans out a feeling of loss and final doom. Captured here are pondering riffs of epic heaviness and despair. The opening lyrics and notes of the first track, Solitude, capture the mood so well that a consistent feeling is created in the mind of the listener that never lets up until A Sorcerer\u2019s Pledge ends. The end, oblivion, hell, whatever bad place you can think of this music takes you there.\n\nThe music is epic and intricate enough to give the listener a reason to dig into the songs. Fat Sabbath inspired riffing abounds mixed in with incredibly atmospheric keys. These aren\u2019t fuzzy riffs like some doom bands use; these are tight and fit the epic doom sound Candlemass creates here. Speaking of the keys, the keyboards and synths don\u2019t dominate the music as they can for some bands, they are there to enhance what the guitars and drums are doing instead of trying to be the main player in these songs which is just perfect. Tight and perfectly crafted solos highlight the emotion in the songs and never stay into mere wankery.\n\nOne thing that must be praised more is the drumming on this album. Matz Ekstr\u00f6m puts on a clinic is the only way I can say it. This isn\u2019t a crazy million miles an hour performance that so many shoot their loads over. These are the pondering drums of doom. Measured and perfectly crafted to enhance the feel of each song. Amazing fills and rolls abound along with incredible use of the double kick drums. Some drummers overplay music, some can\u2019t keep up, and then you have albums like there were the drums are so perfect for the songs that you can\u2019t imagine any other musician improving on them. The sound of the drums is near perfect as well. The kicks punch through and the rolls crack around the kit. The production on this album is very good all around. Not too slick and not too raw with every instrument exactly where it needed to be in the mix. The bass mix is excellent, you can hear it but it doesn\u2019t overpower, it thickens and increases the heaviness of the music. Just very well done and just what these classic tunes need to realize their potential. \n\nNow we get to my favorite aspect of this album, and the reason I find the rest of the band\u2019s catalog pales next to this classic. Johan Lanquist. The emotion and sense of loss and despair he puts into his vocal performance is nearly unmatched in any genre of music. I cannot for the life of me understand the many fans who claim Messiah was the best singer for this band. These are the vocals of doom. Damn why couldn\u2019t he have stayed with the band? Listening to the opening lines of Solitude and you wonder if this guy slit his wrists after recording this song there is so much emotion in the performance. His delivery of Demon\u2019s Gate is a highlight as well. However a Sorcerer\u2019s Pledge is his biggest highlight. An incredible opening line leads to incredible verses where you almost get the feeling that the singer is living this rather than just singing some fantasy lyrics.\n\nLyrically the album covers topics like death, despair, hell, wizardry, and the like. Fantasy sure, but so convincingly sang and written that they feel like the truth. I think I need to listen to Black Stone Wielder one more time. The story told in that song is a real example of lyrical artistry. \n\nThere is no reason you should not have this album. Even if you have never heard any doom metal before you must buy it. Anyone who loves Black Sabbath should buy this album. Hell anyone who appreciates good music should buy this album. \n\nStand out tracks \u2013 All\nWeak tracks \u2013 Are you kidding me?\n",
        "\nThere are a number of albums in which a band writes when they are not considered \"In their prime.\" I often end up enjoying a majority of these albums, and Dactylis Glomerata is no exception. Though how this came to be known as the weakest Candlemass album bewilders me. Perhaps that's because this isn't just Candlemass. Dactylis Glomerata features mother fucking Michael Amott from Carnage, and that alone makes them a super-group in my book. Unlike the usual wandering focus of most doom songs, the Swedish death influence keeps this album nice and chuggy, low, and groovy on every single track. Most of the doom mongers would likely disagree with me when I say that simple, repetitive groove elements should collide with doom more often. I however think the evidence is clear that they should. Dactylis Glomerata, Monotheist, Nature Red in Tooth and Claw, Weight of Light, and countless hardcore influenced sludge albums such as the various works by Pelican demonstrate that simplicity and being primitive is doom's friend. Has the title of Candlemass not produced a number of legendary albums for the last 23 years? It has. What, then, should cause such a remarkable album to be overlooked? Is it the uninspiring cover art? Is it the weak pride and population of metalheads during the era in which this album was produced? Is it the lack of a truly operatic vocalist?\n\nThough the vocals are not technical or operatic at all in comparison to former vocalist Messiah Marcolin, they are respectfully harmonic, and emotional. Upon it is layered a wall of abstract sounds, and tones, as the keyboards take up a lot of the instrumentation and mix in this album. Perhaps this is not only the most keyboard heavy album by Candlemass, but also the best performance on the keyboards by said band. Each of these sounds accompanies the progressive nature of Dactylis Glomerata. Ultimately, the alternative/progressive movement had a great impact on the writing on this album, or more specifically, the vocals.\n\nThis extremely successful progressive turn was carried through to the next album, From the 13th Sun which unfortunately does not feature Michael Amott. Thus, Dactylis Glomerata will forever remain a one of a kind album; a sound that will never be reproduced by Candlemass and probably nor by any doom band to come. I recommend this album to anyone who's heard more than a few doom songs. This isn't just for Candlemass fans only, though it's not the proper album to be introduced to them with. Anyone with a taste for primitive, soulful, raw doom metal is obligated to hear Dactylis Glomerata. This is probably one of the best albums to come out in the late 90's period. Candlemass will forever be remembered by me as one band who stood strong through the \"dark ages\" of metal. This all factors up to be worthy of the 99% mark, titling it the king album of 1998.\n",
        "\nCandlemass return for their 2nd album with new vocalist Robert Lowe (Solitude Aeturnus), a rocking out affair with a number of faster paced songs, yet still cogent of their strength for resounding, slower gothic crush. Perhaps it's the vocals, or the songwriting, or both, but I was left less than inspired by this record. In fact it's probably the worst Candlemass album since the mediocre Chapter VI. Boring enough that a second and third listen were increasingly difficult, as any errant distraction (a fly buzzing past, or a car) could instantly pull me away.\n\nRobert Lowe does not have a bad voice, it's sharp and crisp, and certainly he has the repertoir and qualifications for this duty. But his voice is just...so plain for this band, lacking the powerful operatic theatrics of Messiah or even the chagrin of Bj\u00f6rn Flodkvist. He can hit all the necessary notes but I just don't feel any power here; crucial for effective doom to mine ears. He's not helped by the songs, the faster tracks like \"If I Ever Die\" and \"Dead Angel\" are forgettable, and it's only on a few of the slower tracks that I felt my attention span increase. The strings in \"The Bleeding Baroness\" are nice. \"Demon of the Deep\" is a pretty good track overall which recalls the old days and feel of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. \"Clouds of Dementia\" is another of the better offerings, a crushing lament.\n\nDeath Magic Doom isn't bad, it's just not up to snuff with the band's past works. I actually quite enjoyed King of the Grey Islands, even with Lowe singing, so this is somewhat of a disappointment. It's unlikely the band could manifest another Nightfall or Ancient Dreams, but I shall continue to mourn for those days.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFew bands can truly conjure despair through their music. But against all odds, Sweden's premiere gothic doom outfit, beneath the operatic vocals of Messiah Marcolin and the superb songwriting of Leif Edling, were one of the first bands to succeed. Overwhelmingly. In 1987, you didn't have today's widespread genres of drone, doom, funeral doom, and the like. You had Black Sabbath, Witchfinder General, St. Vitus, and a few other founders and contemporaries. The Candlemass sound embraces the heavier riffing style of Tony Iommi (\"Symptom of the Universe\", etc) and marries it with gothic lyrics of hopelessness.\n\nNightfall is their masterpiece, a flawless slab of crushing sadness drenched in Edling's archaic Christian lyrics. \"Gothic Stone\" is a short intro with some keyboards which perfectly sets up the grooving doom of \"The Well of Souls\". Immediately, the 'Mad Monk' Messiahs Marcolin's vocals offered a distinct alternative to basically ALL other metal music of the period with their operatic power. Yet these aren't calling at you from a theater balcony, but the walls of an abandoned castle, a decaying Medieval cathedral, or a roadside shrine in the Plague Years.\n\nThe instrumental \"Codex Gigas\" follows with its gorgeous gothic dirge, and after that comes one of the greatest doom songs ever written, one of the greatest METAL songs ever written. \"At the Gallows Ends\" begins with some sad acoustics under chords, then erupts into the best riff of its kind since \"Symptom of the Universe\". Jesus. When I first heard this song I was instantly hooked (I had picked up the single before the full-length). Marcolin's vocal line during the chorus is haunting, and the brief lead section near the close of the song is excellent. \"Samarithan\" is another beauty with its slow pace and story-driven lyrics. Chopin's \"March Funebre\" is covered with keyboards and guitars, and then the somewhat faster paced, groovy \"Dark are the Veils of Death\". \"Mourners Lament\", another slower song with some evil riffing. The last vocal track on the album is \"Bewitched\", one of their more popular numbers. And then \"Black Candles\" closes the epic, a haunting instrumental written by Mike Wead of Mercyful Fate.\n\nThe mix of the album was pretty much perfect for its day and it still sounds great to these ears. The band was a class act. This isn't a style of music where one expects any manner of virtuosity, but riff for riff it's one of the best albums of its type to date, if not THE best. The songs are perfect, even the instrumentals which may come off a little sappy. I hold the album as the standard for epic, crushing gothic metal, and the band's influence is still heard today as a landmark between Sabbath and most modern European doom.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIn the year 1986, a strange album was released from a band named Candlemass. On the cover you could see just the band\u2019s name, the title and a spiked skull. This poor, depressive image pictures precisely the music content of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, for Candlemass play slow, doom metal with clearly influenced by the masters of the kind, Black Sabbath, which of course the band never denied. The feelings that prevail here are sorrow and melancholy and its lyrics are dark and pessimistic.\n\nThe band is basically a trio and other musicians contribute as guests. Johan Lanquist, who has taken the vocals, surely doesn\u2019t match the singing abilities of his successor, Mesiah Marcolin, a top doom vocalist. Although he does not possess this \u201coperatic\u201d tone in his voice, he is a remarkable singer with a personal style, since he has a special way of \u201cmourning\u201d on the tracks. Now, let\u2019s see what this is all about.\n\nIn contrast to most metal albums, Epicus\u2026 does not begin with a fast, catchy song but with Solitude, the slowest song in here. It begins peacefully with acoustic guitar and vocals, but as soon as the Sabbathic electric guitar and drums enter, into an unbelievably heavy creation that keeps nailed to the end. The lyrics are extremely pessimistic; the disappointment and rage over life have death as the only salvation, which leads to eternal peace and eases the pain. It\u2019s one of the best they have written and a great way to begin the album. Candlemass\u2019 intentions are obvious.\n\nThe imposing intro of drums and distorted vocals gives its place to an amazing riff combined with mid-tempo drums, resulting to Demon\u2019s Gate, an epic doom song, the perfect soundtrack of the descention to Hades. Lanquist\u2019s vocals help the most for this mystical atmosphere.\n\n\u201cVisions and dreams you can see in the crystal ball\u201d\u2026 As you can tell from those lyrics, Crystal Ball is the dreamy song of the album. The element of fantastic is also pictured in the music since this track is a bit closer to power metal style and doom elements are relatively fewer.\n\nBlack Stone Wielder is a song that refers to the three magicians of Christ\u2019s birth. However, bassist Leif Edling, the main composer of Candlemass, gives his own version of the story making the song sound so dark. It also has a fast-tempo part, maybe the only one in the disc. Under The Oak is another masterpiece with many virtues. It is a melancholic metal hymn, an elegy offered for dreaming. Throughout the atmosphere of disappointment and despair you can surely notice the strength this composition possesses.\n\nCandlemass have chosen to close the album with a truly magnificent song called The Sorcerer\u2019s Pledge. It basically is a trilogy that starts with acoustic guitars. The second part enters suddenly turning it to a metallic thunder. Near the end it becomes quite atmospheric thanks to divine female vocals. Many power metal bands would be pleased if they had written A Sorcerer\u2019s Pledge that carries you into a world of magic and fantasy with its epic/heroic element. The ideal epilogue for the album.\n\nWith Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, and the following Nightfall, Candlemass set the barriers for doom metal and many future doom metal bands were influenced by them. It is truly great.\n",
        "\nSo, right, its taken me a bit of time to think how to write this review of Candlemass' new album, \"Death Magic Doom\", album no.10 for a band that has come and gone over their long career. One is not allowed to label themselves a fan of doom without at least admiration towards the Swedes early back catalogue, which for me is not a problem as I LOVE their first four albums, but listening to their three albums this decade since reformation has always tended to leave me a bit cold. Why is that?\n\n\"Death Magic Doom\" represents the second album featuring Robert Lowe's (Solitude Aeturnus) pipes, who as expected has proven to be an admirable replacement for Messiah Marcolin, and another point on the board of why C-mass are the kings of epic doom metal. However for me, that reputation was made in the 80's and has hardly been topped up since. You see my problem is that I miss their 80's sound, their 80's song structure and I whisper this quietly, Messiah. Lowe, and Solitude Aeturnus, are brilliant, make no mistakes, but whether through production or the quality of the riffs and songs themselves recent Candlemass material too often feels stagnant and blunted and an example of where better technology does not equal better sound. Many songs ended up feeling quite samey through the lack of clarity that defined some truly brilliant albums many years ago. Yes yes I should probably wake up and smell the date but can anyone really argue with me that the sound of \"Death Magic Doom\" or 2007's \"King Of The Grey Islands\" is more emotional and interesting than \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus\" (1986) or \"Nightfall\" (1987)?\n\nThe fact that, excluding the vocal department, the band's three 21st Century albums don't really seem to have evolved doesn't aid my appreciation of them, however this is still Candlemass, and Leif Edling, Mr. Doom if ever there was one. \"Death Magic Doom\" for all my qualms still has some bitching (did I just say that?) songs. \"If I Ever Die\" is an uptempo start before the first signs of crushing doom emerge in the appropriately titled \"Hammer of Doom\", one of those that would most fit an early Candlemass classic due to it's morose downtrodden nature. From here the speed jostles contentedly between crushing doom, mid-paced interludes, and as is their nature these days, a fair amount of faster bounding moments too. Not my favourite those, but their effect is clear: they add a distinct amount of groove that certainly works better live. \"Demon Of The Deep\", through it's incorporation of subtle organ/keyboard work produces the best individual moment of the album, and where Lowe's vocals shine through the strongest, in a similar way to the 'angelic' voices in \"House Of 1000 Voices\".\n\nOverall, you'll see I have mixed feelings about this release. There are some great moments and it stands up strongly against other recent albums in the doom field but I am realising my wish for 'classic' Candlemass will remain just a wish, and probably for the best too. Leif Edling will always know how to write great doom and really I should not question him, so enjoy this work of great 21st Century doom yourself. <\n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nBefore this album came out, it was announced by bassist Leif Edling that this would be the band's best album since the classic \"Nightfall.\" Given that I'm a big fan of Candlemass's 2005 self-titled album; I took that statement with a grain of salt. While this is not on the same level of the band's stuff with Messiah Marcolin, it's definitely a great album and demonstrates the continuing success of the band's new life with vocalist Robert Lowe.\n\nIn terms of the songwriting and musical style, this album appropriately picks up where 2007\u2019s \u201cKing of the Grey Islands\u201d left off and expands upon the elements that helped make that album successful. The band as a unit seems to be more focused in its delivery, the various guitar riffs manage to keep all of the tempo changes interesting, the bass manages to stand out nicely on some spots and even gets a little solo during \u201cHouse of 1000 Voices,\u201d and Lowe sounds a little more comfortable this time around as his delivery ranges from quiet segments to desperate howls and wails. In fact, it\u2019s pretty safe to say that this is different than anything on \u201cNightfall\u201d and sounds unlike anything else that the band has ever released.\n\nI also must say that I particularly enjoy the lyrics on this album. While the lyrics on \u201cKing of the Grey Islands\u201d offered several interesting interpretations and a mysterious overall storyline, the lyrics on \u201cDeath Magic Doom\u201d benefit from some interesting subject matter and a lack of the swearing that seemed to pop up on the band's last few albums (Not that I'm some kind of Tipper Gore fanatic, \"fuck\" and \"shit\" just aren't creative words...). Highlights include the all-out depression of the awesomely titled \u201cHammer Of Doom\u201d (Too bad they couldn\u2019t use it for the album\u2019s title. The one they went with is somewhat awkward\u2026), the Lovecraftian themes on \u201cDemon of the Deep,\u201d and the intriguing ghost story that appears on \u201cHouse of 1000 Voices.\u201d\n\nWhile this is shaping up to be one of my favorite albums of 2009, I do admit that this album has its share of flaws. The music may be pretty unique as a while, but there are a few derivative moments here and there. The main riff on \u201cHouse of 1000 Voices\u201d bares a vague resemblance to the beloved \u201cBewitched\u201d and the last two tracks remind one of the mid-tempo tracks on \u201cKOTGI\u201d such as \u201cOf Stars and Smoke.\u201d Speaking of mid-tempo, I also find that the band\u2019s approach seems to work the best when they stick to slower tempos. \u201cIf I Ever Die\u201d is a pretty solid song, but its faster tempo does make it a strange opener and somewhat out of place when compared to the album\u2019s other tracks. \u201cHammer Of Doom\u201d probably would\u2019ve been a more fitting introduction\u2026\n\nAll in all, this is a strong album that shows a further evolution in Candlemass\u2019 sound. Recommended to doom metal fans everywhere!\n\nPros:\n1) The bands sounds more comfortable this time around\n2) The songwriting is improved when compared to the last album\n3) The lyrics are pretty cool\n\nCons:\n1) A few derivative moments\n2) \"If I Ever Die\" does sound out of place, even if it is a good song\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Hammer of Doom,\" \"The Bleeding Baroness,\" \"Demon of the Deep,\" \"House of 1000 Voices,\" and \"Dead Angel\"\n",
        "\nMany people cite the (first) departure of notorious diva Messiah Marcolin as the end of \"classic\" Candlemass, perhaps not realizing that the band released 3 albums in the 1990's, all of which are worth tracking down. This album still featured all of the classic lineup, minus Marcolin of course, but the sound is a somewhat drastic shift from what previous albums sounded like. Some would say that Candlemass departed from their strong Black Sabbath influences, but these people have obviously not listened to Tony Martin-era Black Sabbath. In fact, I would go as far to say that this album is a response to Sabbath's \"Headless Cross.\" The sounds are indeed very similar, and the result is not as bad as one might think.\n\nNew vocalist Thomas Vikstr\u00f6m is also reminiscent of Tony Martin, perhaps a bit more operatic. He hits some very high notes and overall does an excellent job. Plus he doesn't ruin any of the songs by overusing vibrato like Marcolin did. Lars Johansson really steps it up in the lead guitar department. He fills every song with an extended neo-classical solo and isn't afraid to shred it up either. This is probably his best performance on any Candlemass album. \n\nThe guitar riffs are not as heavy or crushing as they were in the past, but they are still excellent. The heaviness is replaced with a catchy quality that make the songs quite memorable, especially in \"The Dying Illusion\" and \"Temple of the Dead.\" There is also a drastic increase in the presence of keyboards, but thankfully they do not detract from the music for the most part; a notable exception being the keyboards in the intro to \"The Ebony Throne\" which sound like they come from an episode of Scooby Doo. The epic atmosphere of previous Candlemass albums is still present, culminating in the excellent \"Where the Runes Still Speak.\"\n\nIt's hard to find anything wrong with this album. The quality of the songs dips a bit near the end but there is no outright filler. The keyboards are a bit much from time to time, but generally are acceptable. On some versions, there is something called the Sjunger Sigge Furst EP added to the end of the album, which is of no interest to anyone reading this review unless you like hearing covers of Swedish folk songs of the 1950's (trust me you don't). Some versions also include a live DVD on a separate disc and, while hardly essential, still is fun to watch every once in a while. I enjoy listening to Vikstr\u00f6m sing the Marcolin songs; he's not half bad, dare I say even surpassing Marcolin at times?\n\nDespite the change in sound, this is still an album that is worth owning. There are some very enjoyable songs on this album and Lars Johansson's outstanding soloing is icing on the cake. Unfortunately, at least in the United States, this album is a bit harder to track down, but it is definitely worth the money. Sadly, the band would break up shortly after this album, and after an Abstrakt Algebra album, Leif Edling would reform Candlemass with a bunch of unknowns before the classic album reunited in the early 2000's.\n",
        "\nCandlemass. The name should be enough to explain how incredibly important this band has made on the doom metal genre. Sure, Trouble came out with Psalm 9 two years prior to Candlemass releasing Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, however no band outside of Iommi and friends have made a greater impact on doom metal. Leif Edling, the mastermind behind the band, has cemented himself over and over again as one of the greatest songwriters in heavy metal. Present in every lineup, he has been able to take whoever is around him and churn out some high quality doom metal. \n\nAn now we have Death Magic Doom, the third album since the reunion of the original lineup and the second with new doom drone Robert Lowe manning the vocals. King of the Grey Islands was a very good record, however Leif and the gang have really turned it up a notch with DMD. With Lowe being cemented as the long term replacement for the departed Messiah Marcolin, Leif was free to go outside of the box more, overcoming KOTGI's one flaw: lack of Candlemass\u2019 typical doomy experimentation. With classics such as \"Solitude\", \"Under the Oak\", and \"At the Gallows End\" gracing the Candlemass back catalogue, KOTGI just seemed a little stale after a few listens. \n\nDMD has solved that problem, kicking off with the speedy (yes, speedy) \"If I Ever Die\". Lowe really steals the show on this song, letting us know that Candlemass without Messiah is just as good as ever. The opening riff is an instant classic, one that has been stuck in my head almost continuously since I heard it. The obvious middle break in the song is followed by an absolutely fantastic lead courtesy of Mr. Lars Johansson. If I Ever Die is followed by the aptly titled \"Hammer of Doom\", which plods along at a slow and plodding pace typical of Candlemass\n\nThen comes the album's other instant classic, \"The Bleeding Baroness\". This is it, this is the pinnacle of 21st century doom metal. As much as I lauded \"If I Ever Die\", this takes it out back and lays it to rest. \"The Bleeding Baroness\" starts out with the standard Candlemass Depression, then kicks it up a notch until the chorus begins. This is the best Candlemass chorus I have heard since \"Samarithan\". Doomtastic, the best track on the album, no doubt.\n\n\"House of A Thousand Vultures\" and \"My Funeral Dreams\" are the best of the rest, both of which harkens back to the days of Candlemass old. Both could have easily been included in any of the first four albums without feeling out of place. The other four tracks, while good tracks, aren\u2019t anything to write home about. Pretty standard Candlemass fare. \n\nThe production on the album is absolutely fantastic, as depressing and doomified (sp?) as anything I've heard in a long time. The guitars have a nice crunch to them, while the bass is audible, though definitely runs along with the guitars in many places. The drums are a little buried, but the playing is tight and everything we have become accustomed to courtesy of Mr. Lindh. Lowe's vocals do exactly what doom metal vocals are meant to do: soar above everything and add that extra element which makes everything so depressingly catchy, whatever that means.\n\nDeath Magic Doom is without a doubt the best thing that Candlemass has released since Tales of Creation, and well worth picking up. Leif has done it again, but his contribution was never in doubt.\n",
        "\nMany were growing weary of all the botched comeback attempts that went on amongst the old guard of metal in the late 90s and early 2000s, but the one that Candlemass had with Messiah Marcolin managed to bear fruit that wasn\u2019t rotten to the core, and this live offering is the first of 2 solid releases that would mark a short lived, but basically successful reunion. It may be partly due to genre similarities between the two and one having an obvious influence over the other, but every time I contemplate the results of this reunion I end up comparing, or more appropriately contrasting it to the one that Black Sabbath had with Ozzy and the lone live release that that one produced. They are both structured similarly and take that \u201cstick to the classics\u201d approach to a live show, but the divide between the quality of performance between the two is essentially night and day.\n\nThe most obvious contrast that develops here is the gap in quality of both singing and showmanship between Marcolin and Osbourne. Although Messiah does show some signs of tiring at various points throughout the performance, he is able to maintain his composure and carry each tune successfully without creeping flat a half a second after he hit\u2019s the note. His voice is highly expressive, with a vibrato almost wide enough to rival Placido Domingo, but avoids being too squeaky clean and occasionally gets throaty when called for. There\u2019s not a lot of time wasted talking to the audience in between songs, which is always a positive for a live recording, but Marcolin is also able to encourage audience participation without coming off as pretentious or asinine in the process.\n\nFor the most part the songs are faithful reconstructions of their respective original versions, differing somewhat in how much the lead guitar parts are elaborated and the occasional altered drum fill. It doesn\u2019t come off as a lifeless karaoke affair the way Sabbath\u2019s \u201cReunion\u201d did, but it does appear as thought the band was playing it a little bit safe in their performance practices here. Some of the songs are a tiny bit shorter than their studio versions for the simple fact that fadeouts are cut short, or in the case of \u201cMirror Mirror\u201d, \u201cSamarithan\u201d and a couple others, because the euphoria of being on stage probably caused the songs to be played a little faster. This isn\u2019t a huge issue, as these songs are punishing in their heaviness, but the live atmosphere definitely gives a lot of these songs a slightly happier atmosphere than they are in their studio incarnations.\n\nThe highlights on here are pretty obvious, as in this environment the band seems to do better with shorter and catchier songs. \u201cDark Reflections\u201d has plenty of the heavier trappings of the doom style, but its more up tempo and galloping nature makes it an easier song to get into live, especially when audience participations is in play. \u201cBearer Of Pain\u201d is basically the same story except for it\u2019s even faster and Marcolin really throws himself into this one, pouring a ton of expression into every note held more than \u00bc of a second. The one really great performance that runs sort of contrary to the trend of the album is the closer \u201cSolitude\u201d, which basically brings on the glory for being a great song and forcing audience participation at every juncture. Marcolin doesn\u2019t attempt any of the higher end screams that Johan Langquist committed to the original recording, but his performance is otherwise flawless, bring a sense of dimension to a song that is heavily reliant on a dark atmosphere that is often lost on live recordings.\n\nAlthough there isn\u2019t a whole lot of variance in the song selection between this live release and the one done in 1990, this is definitely the better of the two as you get more out of it. Not only are there more songs in terms of quantity, but the renewed vigor that the band exhibited at this time upon reforming definitely shows through on their various performances. Even if it had not have led to an eventual solid studio album with new material, this album alone would stand as proof positive that the short-lived reunion with Messiah was an era of accomplishment beyond simply giving a farewell tour. If this band is on your radar, or any of the other non-stoner metal bands that were strongly influenced by Sabbath, this is something that should be checked out.\n",
        "\nCandlemass have essentially become the standard insofar as slowed down, dark and woeful epic metal is concerned. Mostly sticking to slower tempos, and drawing from the more melodic aspects of Sabbath\u2019s pioneering work in the mid 70s, they\u2019ve had a keen sense of what ideas can be stretched out and repeated while avoiding the boredom that can come from droning music. Although the band has stayed fairly consistent throughout their more than 2 decades worth of musical output, there has been an evolution in the character of their sound that is on full display throughout this entire compilation.\n\n\u201cEssential Doom\u201d takes the road that most purist followers of the band would prefer, sticking only to the Messiah era and a few obligatory selections from their pioneering debut. This has the dual effect of basically limiting the scope of what is already a fairly strict format and gives the impression that the band hasn\u2019t done a whole lot between 1990 and 2003. It\u2019s a bit unfortunate considering that the two albums that were done without Messiah in the 1990s were very good and in keeping with the traditions established by the band in the 80s, yet on another level it is somewhat understandable given that most compilations tend to cater to those who mostly follow the more well known eras of bands and don\u2019t have the commitment to the band to purchase all of the studio output from that time.\n\nMuch like the characteristic epic sound that Black Sabbath began to adopt on \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d and really began to expand upon during the Dio era of the band, most of these songs are very long in length, but follow pretty predictable song patterns. Clearly defined verse and chorus sections with a slightly above average amount of interlude exploration here and there, with no real desire to be progressive as far as song structure is concerned. But the mood that is set on all of these songs tells the story of a band pushing the envelope of what depressive dark music sounds like, setting up gloomy atmospheres through keyboard and acoustic guitar usage, as well as low end, repetitive and minimal riffing that goes just a couple of steps further than what Sabbath would go to at this point, save a few darker songs heard on \u201cBorn Again\u201d and \u201cHeadless Cross\u201c.\n\nAlthough the transition between songs from the various Messiah era offerings are very smooth and consistent, there is a sizable jump in style from the first three songs from \u201cEpicus Doomicus Metallicus\u201d to the rest of the album that is noteworthy. The vocal differentiation between Johan Lingquist and Messiah is relatively small as both possess a similarly woeful baritone/tenor character to their voices, but Messiah\u2019s vocal character proves to be a bit more expressive and operatic, and serves to give the rest of the material on here a much more animated nature. The keyboard atmosphere of the Messiah songs tends more towards a full orchestral sound that serves this sense of expressiveness, while the material from the debut has a bit of an earlier 80s, almost NWOBHM character to it, although much slower in tempo and with darker, lower sounding riff work. But one constant throughout is the lead guitar work, which is really virtuosic compared to even the more showy adherents to early 80s Heavy and Speed Metal. \n\nIf you\u2019ve got the money to burn and you already have all of the albums represented on here, the only purpose in picking this up would be the demo version of \u201cWitches\u201d, which has a bit of a rougher production than the final product that appeared on the self-titled album that marked Messiah\u2019s brief return to the fold. It may or may not be worth it, but those who don\u2019t have any of all of the albums in question are the primary target audience of this release. It could have been better by taking into account the other eras of the band, but for a best of release, it definitely gets the job done.\n",
        "\nI have to admit, I didn't think that Candlemass could come close to matching the magic of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus or Nightfall, but with King of the Grey Islands and Death Magic Doom, they have a sort of new life as a band. Getting Rob Lowe from Solitude Aeturnus to replace Messiah Marcolin was a great move. Rob sounds even more at ease on Death Magic Doom than he did on King of the Grey Islands, and his voice is utilized more fully on the album. They basically took all the good stuff from the previous album and improved upon it. Not only that, but the guitar and drum sound (and really, the overall sound) isn't compressed as it was for both King of the Grey Islands and the Lucifer Rising EP. \n\nI have to admit, I was not a big fan of the Lucifer Rising EP. The two new tracks were okay, but I felt like they could've easily been leftovers from King of the Grey Islands (that didn't make the cut). But Death Magic Doom is a masterpiece of doom. I only have a few bones to pick with the album, so I may as well get them out of the way. The only really big one is on the first track, \u201cIf I Ever Die\u201d. The only part of this song I don't like is how it builds and builds, then all of the band quits playing towards the middle and Rob Lowe sings a vocal line over the silence. He sings it fine, it's just that after all that building, I think it kind of fell flat there. I'm not sure I like it as the album opener, either, but I am at a loss for where to place it in amongst the rest of the album. Anyway, the other bone I have to pick with the album is that, as far as I can tell, Lief Edling is a bit buried in the mix! I like to hear the bass mixed in a little higher in doom metal; it adds a lot to the music.\n\n\u201cHammer of Doom\u201d is a classic track because it starts out as quintessential doom, and then it has the tempo change like we've seen from Black Sabbath's tracks Heaven & Hell or their self-titled track from the first album. \u201cThe Bleeding Baroness\u201d and \u201cHouse of 1000 Voices\u201d are my favorites from the album, namely for both of their amazing chorus lines. Especially on the latter song, where Rob Lowe's voice just sounds haunting and the guitar part is nothing short of fantastic. And Lars Johansson's soloing on the latter track is probably my favorite of his ever. I really hope they play these three tracks live on any upcoming tours they do, along with \u201cMy Funeral Dreams\u201d, which is the album closer \u2013 a strong closer with yet another great chorus part right in the middle of the song.\n\nThat being said, \u201cClouds of Dementia\u201d, \u201cDead Angel\u201d, and \u201cDemon of the Deep\u201d are all okay, but they aren't as memorable as the other tracks I have discussed here. The drumming is good, as usual, and the whole band delivers, but I'd say that Lars and Lowe put in the extra effort that put this album over the top (I'm sure Lief did too, as I am positive he has a heavy hand in the songwriting process). The lyrics are pretty good too, with Rob Lowe continuing his melancholy, saddening style that was earlier seen on Solitude Aeturnus \u2013 Alone (though nowhere near as dark as that album, IMO). He must be one of the greatest voices in doom metal, if not metal in general.\n\nDefinitely pick this one up. Even if you didn't like King of the Grey Islands, I encourage you to give this one a shot. And if you liked King of the Grey Islands, then I am sure you're going to love this one! I'm just sad that I wasn't able to get my hands on the special edition with the bonus track \u201cLucifer Rising\u201d and the 25 minute DVD of footage about their studio work and last tour; I have no doubt that it would have been exciting. Anyway, this is a release not to miss out on, fellow doomsters. This one sets the bar very high for any new epic doom metal to come. Doom on.\n",
        "\nhttp://zephyrusblog.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/candlemass-death-magic-doom/\n\n\u201cI saw the execution of my tomorrow, saw it and bowed\nin the theater of hellfire; the inferno is now.\nI am lost again. I lean against the purgatory gates.\nTo ease my suffering, you\u2019re offering to unlock my fate.\u201d\n\nFrom the snowscapes of Sweden, the legendary Candlemass are back with a vengeance. With little expectation, the masters of Doom Metal have unleashed a monolithic opus worthy of the title \u201cDeath Magic Doom\u201d (perhaps a gibe at Metallica\u2019s \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d).\nThe opening hymn \u201cIf I Ever Die\u201d launches abruptly into the band\u2019s newer, more aggressive style characteristic of their eponymous 2003 rebirth. The instantly memorable first riff sets a higher standard, maintained all the way to the album\u2019s conclusion. Despite their doomy classification, Candlemass aren\u2019t afraid to pick up the pace. This creates dynamic contrasts that diversify the album\u2019s moods. Such creative energy combined with a thick and crushing production creates a relentless showcase welcome to the modern listener. Gone are the atmosphere and reverbed-to-the-max snare drums of \u201cNightfall.\u201d But this departure doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve forgotten their roots and their diehard fans.\n\nThis change is most evident in the vocal department. Rob Lowe has at last settled into his new role, matching the music\u2019s more abrasive approach. Messiah Marcolin\u2019s operatics better suited the epic style of the 80\u2019s albums, but seemed out of place on the self-titled album. Lowe, on the other hand, never overpowers the instruments, finding his place within the music rather than in counterpoint to it. Still, he sings his heart out, running the gamut of emotions, from sadness to hatred to malevolence. Though an objectively weaker vocalist, he sounds more human.\n\nAnd Lowe isn\u2019t the only musician who gives it his all. Jan Lindh\u2019s drumwork is marvelous, ranging from triumphal marches, to rocking grooves to, well, downright doominess! Even after 25 years, Leif Edling perfects the art of the guitar riff from the bass on up. The Dantean lyrical themes, demonstrated at this review\u2019s opening, are nothing original, but appropriate for a band whose works are as timeless (to a true Metal fan) as the Divine Comedy itself.\n\nAnd that leads us to songwriting. \u201cDeath Magic Doom\u201d shines brightest in its choruses, where the time shifts and the anthems ring. This is most apparent in \u201cThe Bleeding Baroness\u201d and especially \u201cDead Angel,\u201d where Lowe, at a haunting pitch, is in dialogue with the lead guitar. One of Candlemass\u2019 classic strengths is the subtle use of synths and samples, here with the hellish bells chiming in the crusher \u201cHammer of Doom.\u201d All these unique qualities aside, this is a Heavy Metal tour de force.\n\nWith this release, their best since 1989\u2019s \u201cTales of Creation,\u201d the rebirth of Candlemass has reached its triumphant climax, reasserting the band\u2019s place at the pinnacle of Doom Metal and, in the shadow of Black Sabbath, one of the greatest Metal bands of all time.\n",
        "\nA few years back, when I first heard that Robert Lowe of Solitude Aeturnus would be taking over the vocals duties in Candlemass following Messiah's departure, I was ecstatic. Don't get me wrong, I love Messiah's vocals, but Lowe easily has him beat in my eyes. So I picked up their first release with Lowe, \"King of the Grey Islands\", with great expectations. And those expectations were met and exceeded.\n\nAnd here we are, two years later, and we have a new Candlemass album, the second with Robert handling the vocals. I had been waiting to hear this album ever since I first heard the song samples a few months back. Those were fantastic, and so I had the same hopes for the album in it's entirety. And those hopes were not in vain, as this CD slays.\n\nOpening with another faster somg. \"If I Ever Die\", the album kicks into gear with the riffs and melodies that you've come to expect from Candlemass. Lowe's vocals soar over the guitars, sounding more organic here than on the previous album. After that first song, the rest of the album is pretty much straight forward doom that Candlemass know how to do. \"Hammer of Doom\" is a slow, brooding number, reminiscent of Sabbath's self-titled track, getting a bit more up-tempo near the end. \"Demon of the Deep\" opens softly, telling a story about a kind of sea creature at the depths of the ocean, before escalating the tempo at the end to make a fantastic finish. One of the album's main highlights, \"House of a Thousand Voices\" lumbers away for a good seven to eight minutes, and wouldn't sound out of place on perhaps \"Nightfall\" or \"Ancient Dreams\". \"Dead Angel\" is a good song, but doesn't quite live up to those that came before it (it is catchy as hell, though). And \"Clouds of Dementia\" and \"My Funeral Dreams finish up the album, the latter not quite reaching the epicness of \"Embracing the Styx\", but still a fantastic song in it's own right.\n\nThe guitars sound as good as ever, the songwriting is inspired, and the lyrics reek of doom. What more could you ask for? Buy this album immediately.\n",
        "\nSweden\u2019s heavy artillery called Candlemass is here again to deliver some Death, Magic, and some pure Doom metal. The second with the fantastic singer Robert Lowe! The bandleader, bassist and songwriter Leif Edling has stated that this is \u201cthe best Candlemass album since Nightfall\u201d. A brave statement, and in my opinion not a statement that is spelled reality, but the fact still remains though that \u201cDeath Magic Doom\u201d is a fantastic album. Exactly as expected on beforehand, they are continuing to swing the hammer of doom with ease.\n\nLet me first just make it clear that the band is in top form, great performances all over! The heavy, hauling riffs from guitarist Mappe Bj\u00f6rkman are lining up one after another, the shrieking guitarsolos from Lasse Johansson, the \u201cDemon of the deep\u201d-bassplayer, Leif does a solid work in the groundwork with his bass, and drummer Jan plays with great feeling as usual. On top of all this, we have the brightest star shining on this album, the before mentioned singer Robert Lowe! He did already on 2007\u2019s \u201cKing of the Grey Islands\u201d show that he was the absolutely right choice to take over after Messiah. I did then say that Robert is the best vocalist that have ever sung in this band. On this album, Robert is making it even more concrete. He can do so much with his voice, and still fit in perfectly with the music so frighteningly good. He\u2019s singing with much variation, in all these variating songs and tempos, and is adding a spooky feeling in general to the whole album. One of his best works in his career!\n\nBut why isn\u2019t this the best album since \u201cNightfall\u201d, then? Everything seems to be in order, right? No, because sadly...this album contains one bad song. Yes, that\u2019s actually true! It is titled \u201cDead Angel\u201d. Sadly, that song is the worst song this band has done since at least the reunion, and I was surprised that Leif could write such a bad song nowadays. Fast, grinding verses (for being C-mass) that really doesn\u2019t do anything, and a very melodic chorus with some cheese threwn in. This song is very diverse from the other ones on the album, and for being Candlemass too at all. It is the \u201cugly duckling\u201d of the bunch...so it\u2019s not a successful experiment from Leif. But except for that lowdown, at least 6 other doom-gems are delivered. \u201cHouse of 1000 Voices\u201d with it\u2019s awesome creepy atmosphere, chorus and the album\u2019s best guitar solo is also the best track on here. Almost 8 minutes of perfection. The variating and strong-chorused \u201cThe Bleeding Baroness\u201d, the sinister \u201cDemon of The Deep\u201d, the slow and heavy as hell \u201cHammer of Doom\u201d, the uptempo starter \u201cIf I Ever Die\u201d with it\u2019s great riffs and melodies, and the ending doom & gloom-song \u201cMy Funeral Dreams\u201d are all awesome ones too. \u201cClouds of Dementia\u201d is also a good one, but slightly weaker than the greater bunch.\n\nThe production is better than the hugely compressed sound of the last C-mass album, even if this one is also a bit compressed. But especially the drums sounds a lot better on here. The guitars also have a rawer and heavier sound, which makes it more pleasant to listen to this album production/sound-wise. But:\n\nDespite that, the production, \u201cDeath Magic Doom\u201d doesn\u2019t really reach the same height as it\u2019s dark predecessor (and their best album since the re-union), \u201cKing of the Grey Islands\u201d. This album is not far away, but the song \u201cDead Angel\u201d crushes the big picture a bit. But as i\u2019ve said, this is still a awesome record, and has a strong chance to be the best album of 2009.\n\n3 best songs: \u201cHouse of 1000 Voices\u201d - \u201cThe Bleeding Baroness\u201d - \u201cHammer of Doom\u201d\n",
        "\nBack when Candlemass founder/bassist Leif Edling was first recording ideas for his new project in the early 1980's, he conceived of the idea of an album based on the creation of the world. He had a vision far greater than anything his previous band Nemesis could achieve, so he formed Candlemass. Much of \"Tales of Creation\" was written before the formation of Candlemass; poems that Edling had written became the inspiration for the writing of new songs. In addition, some ideas originally recorded for Nemesis were reworked for use in this concept that Edling had conceived. \n\nIf one listens to the demos that are included in the two-disc remaster, they'll find that while some themes are present in the early demo versions of the songs (recorded in 1985), other songs, despite having the same name, are completely different. \"Dark Reflections\" sounds like an early power-metal song. This \"Tales of Creation\" concept got derailed during the sessions for the first Candlemass album, when it was decided that they were going to make the album as heavy as they could. \"Under the Oak\" first appeared on \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus,\" and there has been much debate as to which version is better. Leif Edling has stated that he prefers the version on Candlemass' debut, but I like both of them for what they are. I don't worry about which one is better, because each version is suited for the album that it is on. The debut focused on heaviness, so the \"Epicus\" version is well-suited for that album. \"Tales of Creation\" is more epic and grandiose, so the version found on this album fits much better. Special mention goes out to lead guitarist Lars Johansson's phenomenal work on this song.\n\nI've read in several places that this is a concept album, which is incorrect. While this album certainly has a theme, not to mention a guitar line that appears at the beginning of the first song and at the end of the last song (a la \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\"), there is no overall story that continues between songs. The beginning of \"Tales of Creation\" certainly seems like the beginning of a concept album, with opening song \"Dark Reflections\" sandwiched between two short interludes, but aside from a rather pretentious interlude before the closing title track, the songs stand on their own and have very little to do with one another both musically (aside from being distinctively Candlemass) and lyrically.\n\nOne odd choice on \"Tales of Creation\" is the instrumental \"Into the Unfathomed Tower.\" Lars Johansson shreds like he's Yngwie Malmsteen; some feel that this song is entirely out of place, but I think it's awesome. I chuckled at how this song supposedly has seven sections, all with pretentious names, but there is nothing to indicate when one section supposedly ends and another starts, so Edling probably thought of the title and section names even before attaching them to a song. \n\nThe highlight of the album, besides the aforementioned \"Under the Oak,\" is \"Tears.\" The hypnotic yet devastating riff stands out amongst all the riffs in the genre; very few riffs have the ability to create such a strong atmosphere and convey the emotion expressed in the lyrics as well as this one does. Messiah's voice is almost a liability, but Lars Johansson more than makes up for it with a wicked solo.\n\nActually, Messiah's vocals are really hit-or-miss throughout the album. He sounds excellent on \"Dark Reflections\" and \"Under the Oak,\" but he relies too heavily on vibrato and hurts otherwise good songs like \"The Edge of Heaven.\" He definitely has a unique style of singing, but sometimes it is just too over-the-top to be enjoyable. There are some great riffs to be found throughout (which is to be expected on any project that involves Leif Edling), but sometimes the riff-writing slips here and there. The biggest disappointment of the album comes in the closing title track. The main riff is disappointing and Messiah adds nothing to the song, not even a good solo by Lars Johansson can save it. \n\nOverall, however, this album is a resounding success. There are definitely classics on this album that metal fans in general should hear. The album artwork is awesome, although I think they could have chosen a better color than piss-yellow. Sadly, the musical climate would change between this album and the next, and this, along with the departure of Messiah, would tear the band apart, but not before they could release the (even more) underrated \"Chapter VI.\" This album is essential listening for any fan of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nWhen you've recorded an album like \"Nightfall\", the best you can do is split up your band, and spend the rest of your lifetime becoming a legend in eternity. No, I'm kidding of course, but it is only natural that \"Ancient Dreams\" couldn't possibly match the previous one. It is both natural and acceptable. But that doesn't mean we should underestimate it, right? Like we wouldn't like to underestimate \"...And Justice For All\" or \"Somewhere In Time\", because this is the league we're talking about. Absolute Premiership, if you ask me.\n\nSo the recipe is well-known, heaviest, most desperate doom, injected with shots of up tempo riffing like rays of light in a gloomy crypt. Three or four ultimate classics reside in here, \"Up From The Crypt\", \"Mirror Mirror\", \"Darkness In Paradise\" and maybe \"Incarnation Of Evil\" do stand out from the rest-and that's the difference in comparison to \"Nightfall\" where you just can't make a choice. The rest of the songs in \"Ancient Dreams\" are great, but not classics. It seems Leif Edling is a guy who just can't compose a bad song, just good, great and classics. But Edling's great is other people's classics and so on. To be honest, most doom metal bands would cut off one of their testicles to have recorded \"Ancient Dreams\".\n\nSo I think you maybe understand my train of thought behind the \"90/100\". For any, and I mean ANY, other band, this would be a crystal clear perfect 100. In a way, it is deeply unfair that this album is in the shadow of its predecessor. It's so damn heavy, so damn good, so damn well-played and well-produced. The artwork is great, the vocals will make the hair of your back stand like barbed wire, the riffs are like funeral bells in your bedroom, it is a quintessential doom metal album. Don't overlook this one, you will miss a lot. If I had to make a choice, you all know what it would be. But that doesn't mean I can't enjoy \"Ancient Dreams\" with all my soul, right? There's room in my shelf for both of them (actually, for all Candlemass albums in existence) so it's no big deal anyway.\n",
        "\nThis is perhaps one of the most overlooked Candlemass albums \u2013 like other reviewers have said, most people point you to Epicus Doomicus Metallicus and Nightfall as the two best candlemass albums, however, Ancient Dreams is quite a strong release, and perhaps, dare I say, one of the best doom metal albums ever created. \n\n\nOf course, doom metal takes a lot of cues from Sabbath \u2013 and Candlemass is no exception. The riffing here is similar to any early Sabbath. However, Candlemass takes what Black Sabbath had and expands it. They took what Sabbath had and made it darker, longer, and more epic than anything Sabbath put out. Some of the riffs on this album are downright twisted, and the eerie way Candlemass harmonizes a lot of their song\u2019s main riffs makes them that much more creepy. There are no happy riffs here \u2013 every riff on here is sinister and morbid. Imagine wading through tar after a heavy dose of psychedelic drugs, and you get the idea of the riffing on this album. At the same time though, Candlemass manages not only to create significantly creepy riffs they also have those soaring, epic sections that really make the songs on this album, such as near the end of \u201cA Cry From the Crypt\u201d, for the best example. The way Candlemass manages to incorporate these kinds of riffs fluently into their songs is what sets them apart from other doom metal bands, which often end up being too slow and plodding instead of heavy and epic, which is what Candlemass does perfectly. On top of all this they also manage to have many thrashy riffs thrown in, obviously nothing as fast as something off of Bonded by Blood or Darkness Descends, but crushing and heavy. Imagine if Sodom or (early) Slayer got extremely stoned \u2013 that\u2019s sorta what some of these riffs would sound like. This kind of riffing is most evident on \u201cBearer of Pain\u201d, or maybe \u201cIncantation of Evil\u201d. It is also obligatory for a metal album to have guitar solos, and Candlemass does this quite well. The solos on this album are perfectly adapted to the songs \u2013 imagine a slowed down Yngwie Malmsteen, but more sophisticated. The whammy bar is not used recklessly here, unlike many bands which relentlessly abuse it. \n\n\nNow about the vocals of Messiah Marcolin. This guys voice is perfectly suited for Candlemass. His soaring, operatic vocals perfectly compliment the slow, heavy guitars riffs and the slow, crushing drum work. The thing that makes this guy different though is that he has an awesome vibrato \u2013 the power in his voice is unmatched, and probably the epitome of doom metal vocals. \n\n\nThe drumming of Jan Lindh is quite simplistic. Definitely not very fast \u2013 there is no blast beats or ferocious thrash breaks here. However, that doesn\u2019t make it bad. The drumming matches perfectly with the guitars, and the minimalist approach Jan uses works quite effectively. \n\nThe lyrics here are pretty interesting, and are just like the music - dark and sinister. Many of the themes of the lyrics here are fantasy, but with a dark, evil twist, and that gives the listener an impeding sense of doom, and along with the majestically creepy riffs, creates a perfect atmosphere for a metal album, or any album in general, and for 52 minutes you are subjected to some insanely talented songwriting and musicianship, and some of the best doom metal ever. \n\nOverall, I think this is an album that most metal fans can enjoy. It's not too slow, or too fast, but interesting and unique, accessible and easy to listen to, and a true classic in the doom metal genre.\n",
        "\nCandlemass' debut album hit like a hammer, instilling sadness and wonder in many listeners. Candlemass grabbed the reins from Black Sabbath and inspired many doom metal bands to come. Upon starting the album you're greeted with a sad, down tuned rhythm paired with some small keyboard elements. Then almost instantly Johan hits, his mournful voice touching upon your deepest emotions. Candlemass was born.\n\n\nThe sound quality and production is one of my favorite parts of the album. The guitars crunch and churn forward with slow and mournful riffs (Solitude, Under the Oak) and in some cases almost a galloping frenzy (Black Stone Wielder, Sorcerer's Pledge.) and yet they always strike the same emotional chord. Each note sounds perfect, from the start of Solitude to the depressing end of the album. Leif's bass is one of the key parts in delivering this emotion. He keeps rhythm with the guitars, and almost sounds like one at times. The bass is turned up to 11 and it works. His carefully contrived and yet simplistic riffs and passages fill each song with despair as the guitars riff on.\n\n\nWhile sound quality is pleasant to the ears, the lyrics are refreshing for the mind. Songs such as Solitude and Sorcerer's pledge concern men who are at their ends, wishing for a new time (In Pledge's case, literally.) or death. Crystal Ball touches upon humanity's greed and lust for wealth, at a cost. Under the Oak and Demons Gate touch upon the dark, unforgiving side of religious lure. Indeed Leif explores all his horizons on this album, from personal feelings to religious questioning to violence and greed. Unlike the albums successor there is never a feeling of hope. This is pure doom, and each song delivers it in its own way. \n\n\nThe voice of doom is Johan. His delivery here has some eerie, intense vocals. A Sorcerer's Pledge opens with an acoustic bombshell of emotion as Johan mourns a Wizard who failed. Or Solitude, where he is at his wits end while Under the Oak might be his best delivery. On the Bridge Johan cries and moans, recounting a lost love and the situation at hand matched with one of the best guitar melodies on the album. Near the end his screaming falsetto is out of place, but as frightening as doom can get.\n\n\nThis is pure, heavy, unforgiving doom at its best. Highly recommended.\n",
        "\nHighly influential to many (including myself), Candlemass\u2019s \u201cEpicus Doomicus Metallicus\u201d album is regarded as one of the greatest doom metal records ever, and rightfully so. This album pretty much spawned the epic doom metal genre, and influenced countless doom metal bands. Even though it has it\u2019s fair share of flaws like any other album, what makes this release stand above the rest is the dark, gloomy atmosphere it creates. I haven\u2019t listened to an album that exhibits an intense, gloom and doom feeling as this one did, besides a King Diamond or Mercyful Fate album.\n\nThe vocals are outstanding here. Although Candlemass\u2019s most recognizable front man Messiah Marcolin is not on this album, vocalist Johan Lanquist\u2019s performance is excellent. His voice has many similarities to Messiah, but Lanquist has a slightly deeper voice, not by much mind you, though it is apparent. Compare \u201cUnder the Oak\u201d from this album, and then the remade version from \u201cTales of Creation\u201d, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to tell. Lanquist\u2019s voice is quite melodic, and he can even hit the scarce high notes better than Messiah in my opinion. Lanquist\u2019s voice really shines on the opening track \u201cSolitude\u201d, where you can hear the emotion in his voice. A definite highlight of the album!\n\nThe guitars are ok, but the session player on this album is no where near Lars Johansson. A few of the leads sound quickly thrown together, but no matter, there still alright to listen to. The riffs on this album, on the other hand, are fantastic! That\u2019s what really makes up this album anyways; the dark and doomy riffs. That\u2019s one of the perks about doom metal. The genre has some of the most basic riffs out there, but the riffs themselves are THAT good that it doesn\u2019t matter if they are not played at 120 mph like 90% of thrash bands out there. The riffs are dark and gloomy, but at the same time melodic. Candlemass were always good at coming up with great, memorable riffs, and it shows on this album.\n\nLeif Edlings bass is actually pretty audible, you can almost always hear it pounding in the background. He\u2019s a really good bassist, and the lyrics he came up with are magnificent. The lyrics are well thought out, and really sets the tone for the whole album. Mainly the lyrics deal with death like in \u201cSolitude\u201d, but there are some fantasy themes thrown in their as well, which adds some variety.\n\nThe production of the album is quite good, even though there are some cracks in the sound at some times. The album was most likely made on a next to nothing budget, so that really doesn\u2019t take anything away from the music. It also adds to the music a bit, as a doom metal album really shouldn\u2019t have a crystal clear production anyways.\n\nA landmark album in the epic doom metal genre, \u201cEpicus Doomicus Metallicus\u201d paved the way for other doom metal bands such as Solitude Aeturnus and Memory\u2019s Garden. Even though I would rate their next album \u201cNightfall\u201d just a bit higher than this one, you can\u2019t miss out on this. Though you can\u2019t really go wrong with any of Candlemass\u2019s first 5 albums. Awesome vocals, doom and gloom riffs, pounding bass and well written lyrics make this album a must listen to any fan of doom metal. I HIGHLY recommend it!\n",
        "\nBeing a pretty massive fan of King of the Grey Islands\u009d (Messiah? Who's that?) I was pretty keen to get this. It's hard to stuff up doom live; it's not terribly complex and the loud volume and typically cavernous live sound works great with the genre. In this new EP most of the new songs are good ,and the live tunes are great; that's good enough for me.\n\nI hope \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lucifer Rising\u00e2\u20ac\u009d isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t off the new album. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got some decent enough riffs but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer riiising!!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d hook is extremely irritating and gets repeated a few hundred times. I honestly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was possible for the new singer (whatever his name is) to put a foot wrong, but there you go! Turns out he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a perfect doom front man android after all. The other two new/re-recorded songs sound basically exactly the same as the last album, which is to say that they are objectively awesome and will appeal to anyone with good taste in music. The simple but huge riffs, dark and oppressive atmosphere, massive guitar tones and brilliant world-weary vocals; all here and in good nick. Good doomy times are ahead, it seems.\n\nBut anyway, the live tunes. They pretty much nail everything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s required for a live show; powerful production that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound like it was molested too much in the studio, a tight and powerful band, and a very loud and enthusiastic crowd. Not knowing much about the Candlemass discography I have no idea if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great setlist, if they play \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the hits\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or whatever but the songs on it are pretty good so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no real complaints. Highlights would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Emperor of the Void\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for massive mid tempo riffs and a huge chorus, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Dwarf\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for massive mid tempo riffs and a huge chorus, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under the Oak\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for massive slow riffs and a huge chorus.\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a simple enough formula and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good that Candlemass don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t throw any spanners in the works; no bold explorations into left field minimalist jazz or whatever, just massive doom tunes. The riffs keep flowing but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough variety between the songs so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get terribly bored, the singer doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk too much to the crowd, and the fans are passionate in their singing along but not too loud in the mix; honestly what more could you ask? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Candlemass, playing a good set and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been represented well with a powerful, bassy recording job. Combine it with some solid new and kinda new tunes and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really any reason why you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get this album.\n",
        "\nI am a huge Candlemass fan and here is my impression about this EP.\n\nPackaging: A HUGE disappointment. The CD version has a one-sheet liner that unfolds showing the same lame-looking graphic as the one on the front cover (why insult your fans twice?). There are no lyrics or photos or anything visually stimulating to look at. 0/5.\n\nNew Songs: Lucifer Rising is fast, straightforward, and simple; a nice little rocker but I find extremely light in substance. The band may have wanted to start off the EP with a fast number as they did with the last two LPs, but Black Dwarf and Emperor Of The Void are both much better songs. Lucifer Rising is utterly one-dimentional and BORING. It is mainly vocal-driven, with a weak riff behind it. The \u00a1\u00a7Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer Rising\u00a1\u00a8 chorus is repetitive to the point of absurd. 2/5.\n\nWhite God is slower with a stronger riff but still average. I can\u00a1\u00a6t help but notice its mediocrity compared to the classic doom tracks off Epicus Doomicus Metallicus and Nightfall. It is seriously lacking good songwriting to making it timeless. 2/5.\n\nRe-recorded Song: Demons Gate has this time around omitted the introductory soliloquy, being just a tad faster with a different solo. It\u00a1\u00a6s been over 20 years since the original version appeared on EDM, and the band has since a new drummer, lead guitarist, and vocalist, but I still prefer the original version for its dramatic and varied drumming and understated but heart-felt vocal work. Lanquist and Ekstrom were the stars of that version no question about it. I feel that Lowe\u00a1\u00a6s voice is too nasal and snarly for this song (in places I feel he tries too hard to be sinister) and I just find Lindh\u00a1\u00a6s drumming lack the needed intensity and variety to keep this long song engaging. 3/5.\n\nLive Tracks: You get to experience that the old classic tracks sound like with Lowe singing them on concert stage. They are nothing spectacular if you are used to hearing the same songs from the other live albums and DVDs. You will hear some banters between Lowe and the audience and a lot of crowd noise and sing-alongs, which I supposed are acceptable as live recordings. I also don\u00a1\u00a6t find Lowe\u00a1\u00a6s voice carry as well as Messiah, although he can certainly hit the high notes just as well if not better than the mad monk. 4/5.\n\nProduction: Drums and bass sound a little weak as if lacking tone center. Good balance of vocal (not too loud) against the guitars (great tone by the way). On the live tracks it sounds muddy in some places but crystal clear in other places. 4/5.\n\nConclusion: The self-titled LP was a strong comeback album, but for me King of The Grey Island wasn\u00a1\u00a6t as strong. It seems to me Candlemass has gradually shifted its style towards a traditional heavy metal sound, whereas I feel they need to stay focused with their doom metal origin. I hope that for their next LP they return to the style of Black Stone Wielder, Samarithan, and Mourner\u00a1\u00a6s Lament, a style that made them successful, and write fewer but better-developed DOOM songs with sound structures, heavy riffs, and engaging atmospheres. \n\nMy overall score for this EP is 15/30, a passing grade of 50%. I recommend casual fans to avoid this release, as I would only recommend it for the diehard completist fans wanting to check out Lowe on live tracks.\n",
        "\nI don't want to lightly hand out a 100% to an album, because no album I've heard is necessarily perfect. But this one, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, Candlemass' debut full-length, is so fucking close I almost want to do just that...\n\nBut I can't. Not yet anyway. This may be the perfect metal album, but it may not. So I'll take the unconventional route and divide the album to parts using averages, etc. and coming up with a complicated rating system that only makes sense in my brain.\n\nWhile I do this, I may as well tell you how I feel about the whole thing.\n\nThis is a crushing slab of Heavy Metal, the kind slowed to a crawl, and dropped on your head like the proverbial Acme Anvil. You will be left dumbfounded after this is through spinning, and the only way to release yourself from the addictive, cold grip of this masterpiece, is to drown it out with a better album.\n\nGood luck finding one, I know I still haven't.\n\nThe thing with this album is not that it is the most technically evolved piece of music (it's not) or that it is the most diverse piece of music (it's not), but that the atmosphere is so solid that they may be playing only 3 notes per song (in some cases, that may very well hold true) and you wouldn't fucking notice. Because the notes would sing through your brain and find the deepest, most sensitive sectors of your imagination, and probe them into life.\n\nSome of the tracks on here are so catchy (yes, catchy doom metal...) that I can't help but listen over and over. I've often found myself with Black Stone Wielder or Demon's Gate running through my head at all hours, until, once or twice a week, I have to spin this beauty of an album. It's really that addictive.\n\nThe vocals are soaring, powerful, and evocative of battle hymns mated with forlorn arias that drive the words home in a very unforgettable way. From the beginning of Solitude, Johann Lanqvist takes a place in your head as a unique vocalist, never matched (even by the more-recognized Messiah Marcolin, who's vocal stylings were more soaring, but lest emotional). In Demon's Gate, you hear the vocal howls becoming more and more possessed by emotion as the song moves further and further along into a crushing, maniacal climax. The man sounds like he's going mad, while keeping a steady tune. Black Stone Weilder has a wonderful, ghastly delivery, that lends to the atmosphere of desolation and decadence. He really lends all that he can to this album, throughout. Crystal Ball is full of frenzied variations that fit the scheme of the music perfectly, while Under the Oak tends to be more personal and less thematic (from a man who didn't even write the fucking song!) Sorcerer's Pledge is an amazingly dramatic Exeunt, leaving you wishing he'd made another record... \n\nThe dual guitar attacks carry a signature sound that would move on with the band from this point. Two different notes, played in harmony, the same riff, but different octaves. Seems to be the credo. And it works! To extraordinary effect, you can hear guitars turned into machines of pattern-weaving and emotion-spurring. You will be compelled by the plodding excess that leaves you little choice but to put yourself inside the music. Slow (Demon's Gate) Medium (Solitude) or Fast (Sorcerer's Pledge), the feeling of being surrounded is present nonetheless. Sometimes there will be an epic break into a long, drawn-out note, while a chorus / pre-chorus is playing (see Black Stone Wielder), which became another leitmotif of the Career of Candlemass for years to come (hey, if it ain't broke...)\n\nThe bass is simply a bass... There's nothing wrong with a bass-player who plays rhythm with the guitars, and this is definitely a working formula here, because despite it's follow-along nature, Lief Edling will not allow his bass to be a backup. Due to the genius mixing, the bass acts like a third guitar, completing the harmonies, while still applying pressure to the rhythm.\n\nThe drums? Fucking brilliant! Not fast, but not achingly slow, and they are always played with precision and decisiveness, including effective fills that compliment the riffage (see EPIC breaks, in Black Stone Wielder). Nothing wrong there.\n\nHey, lookit that! My brain is finished...\nOh, oh shit, I found a winner. Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, my first 100% review, and definitely worthy of it. You want crushing doom? Find it here, friends.\n",
        "\nNot having heard this band before this release I was expecting their brand of \u00e2\u20ac\u009depic doom\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to be some super intricate thing full of incredibly long songs and heaps of narration and whatnot. Shame this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as grandiose and epic as I was expecting but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a good surprise; I expected a doom take on Summoning but instead I got a doom take on doom; big riffs that are slow and mostly good combined with vocals that are also slow and always good.\n\nFirst thing that strikes you (past the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153damn this is a really annoying intro riff\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) when the real music comes in is that is really heavy. Monolithic, huge, crushing, dense, etc. etc. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to describe the guitar tone in anything but the usual doom cliches; suffice to say that the guitar tone weighs a great deal. Moreso then any other genre doom metal needs big guitars, and the producer of this record really understood that, pushing the guitars up in the mix, yet still keeping everything else well placed. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCourse, while massive guitar tone will carry an album a fair way it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it good; and while the songs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite match the production on show here they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still real solid and make this whole thing a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\nA simple enough description of the stuff on offer here would be a more misanthropic Black Sabbath. Riffs of the dense and heavy variety come in, the singer- who was a really nice middle range voice, perfect for the music- rages about satan and the human race, a solo or perhaps a mid tempo section comes and goes, and Candlemass resume the misery and hate. Honestly I really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting this album to be as dark as it is- I guess mostly listening to the Sleep style of stoner/doom has made me forget just how cheerless this kind of stuff can be. Doom is serious business for these guys, and that attitude helps Candlemass pull off some riffs that otherwise shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work- the good ol\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 one semitone riff in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Destroyer\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the sort of pointless nothing intro to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Man of Shadows\u00e2\u20ac\u009d- they would normally invite some sort of snigger from me, but I swear I can hear these guys going \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come on, just try to laugh at it\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, at which point I shut up and resume my equally serious listening.\n\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong though- this album doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u02dct get by on it\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs vibe, this is a good album with lots of good moments. Pick a track, any track, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a heap of massive riffs ready to do a big, onyx-coloured shit on you. Never has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We set sail in July\u00e2\u20ac\u009d sounded as depressing as it does in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearsight\u00e2\u20ac\u009d; a real huge mid tempo brawler of a tune that makes you want to go out and knife yuppies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of Stars and Smoke\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is probably the most typically sad type doom thing here, not as angry as the other songs, perhaps, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still huge and has a really nice solo- as do most songs really- the noodling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always tuneful and economical. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sweet little breakdown on offer here too, made all the more effective by the fact that it hardly happens anywhere else in the album. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Embracing the Styx\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 is probably the highlight, though- a really fine intro/verse riff, super heavy and really eerie, all supported by some fine drumming and subtle ivory jingles. It\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs probably the best song on here, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs heavy it\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs fucking heavy. I love how the drummer speeds things up a little bit once in a while in this song, makes the thing seem strangely frantic and, I dunno heavy. Instant doom classic, for serious. Overall I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really say there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge amount of variety here- Candlemass plug the slow riffs, the vocalist is depressed and sings with a lot of passion, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some mid tempo sections. However this is the kind of music that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simple and straight-forward in it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach. Like many things about doom, Candlemass understand this.\n\nThe slowness and lethargy on offer here has been executed rather well; Candlemass wanted to give you a dose of riff filled misery and they certainly succeed. If you like doom, get this, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very good album. Simple as that.\n",
        "\nEvery time there is an important band that makes the decision to switch from their alleged principle vocalist to one of equal prominence, I always get this strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as if I\u2019m reliving the entire experience of discovering Black Sabbath post-Ozzy. There is naturally a fair share of loyalists who cling to the notion that the band ceases to be when their renowned singer disappears from the fold, but most of these types never even bothered to listen to the Dio years of Sabbath, let alone the brilliant work done with Tony Martin, lest their minds would be instantly changed by the equal, if not superior work done by these lesser known figures. Vocally the contrast between Lowe and Messiah is very similar to that of Dio and Ozzy, but unlike with Rainbow and Sabbath being very different creatures during the 70s, the common genre shared by Candlemass and Solitude Aeturnus makes this vocal transition between this album and its predecessor much easier to accept for the otherwise orthodox doom metal faithful.\n\n\u201cKing Of The Grey Islands\u201d is interesting in its approach of not trying to impress, yet simultaneously being quite impressive. The songs are presented in a very methodical manner, putting forth traditional structures and emphasizing strong ideas worth the constant repetition that is peculiar to doom metal, as well as ones that are conducive to the dark atmosphere required for the desired effect. Right from the first few seconds of \u201cPrologue\u201d, where a basic clean guitar line reflects the plain yet haunting imagery depicted on the album cover, you can tell that a peculiarly dark musical picture will emerge. But the actual experience is not quite the mere sorrowful wailing that some tend to pigeonhole the genre with, but a multifaceted sort of darkness that can be fatalistic, angry, spiteful, or the more expected mix of hopelessness and depression. This all combines with a sort of mysticism that the band has always carried in their lyrical subjects to create something that is very distinctive yet accessible. Comparisons to the whole of this album could be made to Sabbath\u2019s \u201cDehumanizer\u201d and \u201cCross Purposes\u201d in a sense, although the final product is definitely its own beast.\n\nThe individual chapters of this book of an album fall into two distinct categories, namely the catchy melodic sort and the epic atmospheric numbers. \u201cEmperor Of The Void\u201d and \u201cOf Stars And Smoke\u201d are the best examples of the shorter and slightly more accessible songs put forth here, putting a good deal of emphasis on melodic choruses and muddy yet easy to follow riff lines. The latter one has an utterly spellbinding, yet short guitar solo with a tone that almost perfectly mirrors Craig Goldie\u2019s brilliant sound on Dio\u2019s \u201cMagica\u201d. Among the longer, more drawn out songs, there is a trend where the longer these guys tend to go the better their product becomes. The dark and droning recitation that is \u201cDestroyer\u201d departs from the mystical/fantasy based subjects for vile depictions of villainous schemes, perfectly reflected in Lowe\u2019s angry yet still very melodic vocal interpretation. \u201cEmbracing The Styx\u201d, which is my personal favorite of all the songs on here, perfectly demonstrates that if you come up with the right combination of notes for a riff and put the right atmospheric touches on it with the rest of the arrangement; you can repeat the hell out of it, vary it very little, and yet still keep it interesting. The principle intro riff, when combined with the rumble of the double bass drums, create this sort of horrific atmosphere quite similar to what the river Styx may have appeared to anyone viewing it.\n\nWhen you get right down to it, there is very little on here to criticize or to want for. The only thing that might improve this is a little more emphasis on the lead guitar, as there is a disproportionate amount of repetitive atmospheric sections that are either presented without a leading instrument, or take the occasion to focus on Lowe\u2019s vocals. At times, the album seems to be mostly vocally driven than anything else, and the solos, though very well realized, tend to not last very long. It\u2019s understandable to take this approach when considering Lowe\u2019s very expressive and versatile voice, but it also has the detrimental effect of sometimes making the music come off plainer sounding than it necessarily should. Perhaps it\u2019s my own addiction to hearing slow melodic metal by the likes of Axel Rudi Pell, who puts greater emphasis on leads than he does riffs or vocals, but the leads on here are expressive and interesting enough to merit a little more attention paid to them.\n\nThis album is a slight step up from the \u201cself-titled\u201d one that preceded it, but people just discovering this band would be well served by going earlier into their catalog first, preferably to their 80s material. Fans of Solitude Aeturnus will probably take to this pretty easily as it\u2019s similarities to this band are comparable to the ones between Dio and the albums Sabbath put out with the same front man. Candlemass has an uncanny ability for adapting its sound to fit a new vocalist, as shown in their all but impeccable back catalog, but hopefully Robert Lowe will be able to juggle both projects for a while and there will be more where this came from.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on September 26, 2008.\n",
        "\nOne of Sweden\u2019s most influential bands, Candlemass are the fathers of the epic brand of doom metal that fuses the mystery and crushing tempos of doom metal with the magic and melody of power metal. Epicus Doomicus Metallicus (henceforth \u201cEDM\u201d) is their landmark debut, an album that while merely a stepping stone towards things to come for the genre as a whole, is nonetheless a complete and essential album for fans of any brand of heavy metal. \n\nThough Candlemass certainly have a strong claim as one of the styles innovators, I do not agree with fans\u2019 claim that they invented it. Even if you don\u2019t consider Black Sabbath the style\u2019s founding father (I do), many of the ideas on \u201cEDM\u201d can be found on Trouble\u2019s Psalm 9 album, released a few years prior to this. What Candlemass have really done here is established a uniform reincarnation of the Sabbath sound that would become the base for pretty much every doom band to follow, from Solitude Aeturnus to Cathedral. The music is very heavy and very forlorn, maintaining an image of gloom for almost its entirely. Things never pick up above a crawl, yet they never drag either. Vocalist Johan Lanquist, predecessor to their long-time singer Messiah Marcolin, wields a mighty tenor that can roar into the stratosphere at any notice, altogether filling the space left by the minimalistic riffs with an air of mystique. The guitars themselves are used to create beautiful harmonies and well-crafted solos when they\u2019re not toiling away at bleak, immersive rhythms during which the bass provides much of the melody. The drums are truly the backbone, never ceasing to give life to the dreary pace of the album (and adding to the funereal feeling). And all of this without ever bringing the pace up past a jog. \n\nDue to the length of the songs, \u201cEDM\u201d feels more like a journey than an album, but it rewards those that take the time to listen. Few albums can cast a mood from the very first note and maintain it until the very last. Candlemass, in their drive to create the eeriest music possible, have certainly done it here. All six songs are classic (the even ones are my personal favorites) and the album on which they\u2019re featured is as well. No other band would really be able to outdo this album\u2019s mysticism until Symphony X arrived to pair similar lyrical themes with their new brand of power metal. Even if you don\u2019t always understand precisely what they\u2019re trying to say, the feeling the music gives you explains it all, elevating this album above your pedestrian pop metal records.\n\nI\u2019ve merely scratched the surface in my description of this album, so I highly recommend to the curious that they listen for themselves. Anybody sitting comfortably on the fence will surely lean in this album\u2019s favor after having heard it.\n",
        "\nThis is one of those albums which helped define my adolescence. It was the first time I'd heard doom. It was the first time songs had actually scared me! This might sound quaint in these days of sicko extremity and blacker-than-thou blackness in blackest of black metal (!) but back in the late 80s, only a handful of bands had the ability to give you the heebie-jeebies in their music. But there was a genuinely eerie quality to Candlemass's songwriting and performances on this album which set the band apart from other purveyors of supposedly evil/Satanic metal. Candlemass eschewed the gore and deliberate attempts to offend that characterized Slayer. They were also less fixated on horror movie theatricality than King Diamond. Candlemass, to me, can be mentioned in the same breath as Celtic Frost in terms of their scariness. But CF were much more radical, leftfield, experimental, avant garde. Candlemass were simpler; more obvious, perhaps. \n\nOn Ancient Dreams, they deal with fairly stereotypical lyrical themes of dark fantasy and demons and devils and etc on the whole. But the songs are delivered with such panache, such skill, such emotion and such a fantastic ear for melody that you'll forgive them that. And, anyway, Epistle No 81 is a completely unexpected and unusual song. It's a mourner's lament, a heart-rending ode to mortality which has its origins in the imagination of 18th century Swedish poet Carl Michael Bellman. It's an oft-overlooked doom metal classic. But then, I'd say every single song on the album is a classic in its own right. You'll weep at the crushing, monumental beauty of the riffs the band come up with on song after song. Rifftastic highlights include Darkness in Paradise, Incarnation of Evil, Ancient Dreams and Mirror, Mirror. \n\nSacrilege though it might be to say it, I actually prefer the Black Sabbath Medley that closes Ancient Dreams to the originals it distils so perfectly! And I haven't even mentioned Messiah Marcolin's phenomenal voice yet! He was truly one of the greatest frontmen metal has ever seen with a highly distinctive sound that is simultaneously so pleasing to the ears and powerful. Wonderful as his performances on the other Candlemass albums might be, Ancient Dreams represents the pinnacle of his career. It is also the band's best work to date.\n",
        "\nMost people rate Nightfall and Epicus Doomicus Metallicus as Candlemass's best two albums. But I think Ancient Dreams is just as good in many ways. Better in some ways, actually.\n\nFirst off, people often say that \"A Cry from the Crypt\" is a weak song because it sounds vaguely like \"At the Gallows' End\" from Nightfall. I disagree. It is a great song - pure doom from beginning to end. Even better, it has a really sad and tragic riff at the end, and is the only one of Candlemass's songs that actually makes me feel sad, from their first four albums at least.\n\nNot only that, but this album is pure doom - 52 minutes of it - all eight tracks are proper doom metal tracks. And the final and ninth track, \"Black Sabbath Medley\", is no worse than the instrumental tracks on Nightfall and Tales of Creation. Those tracks are what prevent Nightfall from being a perfect album, in my opinion. They are filler. Same with Tales of Creation. On the other hand, on \"Ancient Dreams\" there is no filler, except for Black Sabbath Medley. All eight of the proper tracks are pure doom, and I find all of them to be either very good at the least, or excellent at the best.\n\nBesides the awesome \"Mirror, Mirror\", which is probably one of their best songs ever, and \"A Cry from the Crypt\" which I still really like, \"Darkness in Paradise\" and \"Incarnation of Evil\" are also fantastic doom metal songs. Darkness in Paradise was supposedly made less good because it had a bad production job, but I don't notice this - it's a great song, probably one of Candlemass's best. Fantastic Solo in the middle. Great words too.\n\nIncarnation of Evil is also great.......very doomy and very evil and scary. Brilliant riffing and creepy words. I don't know why Leif Edling doesn't like this song, I think it's awesome.\n\nNext, \"Bearer of Pain\" is much faster, almost thrashy at times, and although it isn't as dark and scary as the previous songs, it's a great fantasy based song with good riffs and solos. \n\nThe title track, \"Ancient Dreams\" is a bit on the slow side, but that means it is even doomier. Definitely an interesting dark fantasy tale. A good song anyway.\n\nThe last two songs, \"The Bells of Acheron\" and \"Epistle No. 81\" are good songs too, the former being fast and semi thrashy, the latter being slow, plodding, and doomy. But both are good.\n\nAs for \"Black Sabbath Medley\" - well, it's Black Sabbath. I find this track to be ok. Certainly, it isn't out of place to have Black Sabbath on a doom metal album.\n\nThe other reason why I think this album, along with Nightfall, is actually better than Epicus Doomicus Metallicus in places, is because it has a unified theme, and so does Nightfall. They aren't concept albums - that isn't what I mean. I mean the songs have similar themes, which makes the albums fit together better. On Nightfall, for instance, almost all of the main six songs - four of them - are about death, in one way or another. \"The Well of Souls\" and \"Bewitched\" are about demons coming from hell and a person being possessed by the devil, respectively, but other than that, the album has a much more unified theme than Epicus, which was six songs - six great doom metal songs, to be sure - but they were, perhaps, too different from one another lyrically. On Nightfall and Ancient Dreams, this is not so. Ancient Dreams, unlike Nightfall, focuses on dark fantasy, heaven and hell, and demons and devils rather than death, which makes it very mythological and interesting.\n\nAnyway, a great doom album - easily one of the best albums I could recommend to anyone who wants to understand what true doom metal is. Candlemass is epic doom metal, but they are proper and pure doom in every way. And Ancient Dreams is one of the finest pure doom metal albums ever - the biggest reason, besides all of what I have already listed, being that besides the final track, there is no filler whatsoever on it. Pure doom metal.\n",
        "\nAfter having released the excellent debut album \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus\", which was unfortunately met with poor sales, Candlemass had acquired a loyal local and underground following. By the time the first album had been recorded they had also acquired a new singer in the form of Messiah Marcolin, a man classically trained within the fine arts of opera singing. This gave Candlemass a unique edge not only within the doom realm, but also in the realm of all things metal.\n\nThe production is excellent when it comes down to the fact that Candlemass was just an underground band at the time, but it's nonetheless very good. Messiah\u2019s vocals are godly, and so are Lars Johansson\u2019s leads. Edling\u2019s bass playing isn\u2019t bad either, but he\u2019s no Steve Harris or Joey DeMaio.\n\nThe first real song is called \u201dThe Well of Souls\u201d, which is preceded by the short instrumental track called \u201dGothic Stone\u201d. Right at the beginning of the song, you\u2019ll know that Candlemass\u2019 new vocalist is not a bad one, but your head will most likely explode if you can\u2019t tolerate operatic vocals.\n\nThe next song is called \u201dAt the Gallows End\u201d, and is probably one of Candlemass\u2019 best songs ever. It has a very sad and very emotional mood, and Marcolin\u2019s vocals and Johansson\u2019s lead only enhances the song\u2019s already existing excellence. This song is also preceded by a short instrumental track. This time it\u2019s called \u201dCodex Gigas\u201d.\n\n\u201dMarche Funebre\u201d is a cover of a classic piece by the composer Frederyk Chopin. This is probably my least favourite song on the album, but it works amazingly well within the concept of the album.\n\nThe main driving force in the next two songs, entitled \u201dSamarithan\u201d and \u201dDark Are the Veils of Death\u201d, are the vocals. The part where Messiah goes \u201dBegging for a penny to survive\u201d in \u201dSamarithan\u201d will stick in your mind for a long time.\n\n\u201dMourners Lament\u201d is a little more forgettable, but it is probably the most doomy track on this album and the lyrics tell a strong story.\n\nAnd so the album closes with \u201dBewitched\u201d and \u201dBlack Candles\u201d. \u201dBewitched\u201d crushes everything in its path with a severe heaviness and an absolutely crushing lead played by Johansson. \u201dBlack Candles\u201d is another little instrumental track that closes the album in nice fashion.\n\nThis is an essential album for all doomsters, but you can definitely find some crossover appeal if you\u2019re willing to look below the surface.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s funny how history repeats itself. \u2018King Of The Grey Islands\u2019 is Candlemass\u2019 weakest album since \u2018Chapter VI\u2019, also recorded in the wake of vocalist Messiah Marcolin\u2019s departure from the band. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad news though \u2013 even \u2018Chapter VI\u2019 had a few standout moments, like \u2018When The Runes Still Speak\u2019 or \u2018The Ebony Throne\u2019, for instance, and this album is aided greatly by the presence of Solitude Aeternus\u2019 Robert Lowe on vocals. Lowe is a brilliant doom vocalist in his own right and has a stronger presence than the somewhat generic Thomas Vikstrom did on \u2018Chapter VI\u2019.\n\n\nAnd at first, this album seems invincible. Opening with a suitably dark and melodic instrumental \u2018Prologue\u2019, the Swedish doomsters go on to score a hat-trick with \u2018Emperor Of The Void\u2019, \u2018Devil Seed\u2019 and the haunting, exquisite \u2018Of Stars And Smoke\u2019. The band is completely on point here, with strong riffs, memorable melodies and immersive song structures. But then, somewhere halfway through \u2018Demonia 6\u2019, the album hits a slump. While songs like \u2018Clearsight\u2019 and \u2018Man Of Shadows\u2019 have their moments, there\u2019s a definite slackening in intensity, a sense of meandering from one doomy sequence to the next without a masterplan in mind. The band is never less than flawlessly competent, but there\u2019s an under-developed feel to the material, as if they needed more time to really find each song\u2019s niche and fully incorporate Lowe into the equation. Still, class will show, and few doomsters can match bassist and main man Leif Edling\u2019s class. All the loose ends and meanderings of the in-between material are reined in for a final, epic track, \u2018Embracing The Styx\u2019 which makes full use of Edling\u2019s knack for churning out sluggish, immense Iommi-esque riffage and bleak, compelling melody.\n\n\nPerhaps the weaknesses of this album stem from it being a bit of a rush job \u2013 Leif Edling released the last Krux album in 2006, and Robert Lowe had to find time for this album in between his main band\u2019s 2006 release, and Concept Of God, a Solitude Aeternus side-project with a 2007 release. There\u2019s nothing drastically wrong with \u2018King Of The Grey Islands\u2019, it simply lapses below the sterling standard of a classic Candlemass album by a few, crucial notches that make a rather definite difference between an admittedly decent release and another Candlemass essential. \n\n\n\nwww.kvltsite.com\n",
        "\nI was playing 'Essential Doom' in the car with a non-metal friend, when he bemusedly asked me to explain the appeal of such a band as Candlemass. I told him to imagine ordering a pizza, a delicious pizza with all of his favourite toppings in perfect combination. Now, I said, imagine that pizza, smothered with extra cheese. He understood straight away, though I don't think I made a convert of him. \nWhen I heard that Robert Lowe of mediocre, cheese-dripping Solitude Aeturnus was to join the legendary C-mass, I was overjoyed, not only because it would give him the platform to realise his considerable vocal potential (and on decent recordings, I might add), but also because I felt that after years of emulating the epic doom sound, he thoroughly deserved the chance to play the real thing. I was not disappointed.\n\nKing of the Grey Islands, to carry the analogy, has only a modest sprinkling of cheese. Edling's style has definitely evolved since the glory days of Nightfall and Ancient Dreams, and where once the sound was restrained (as in 'Cry from the Crypt'), of late it surges relentlessly forward (as in 'Black Dwarf'). Grey Islands certainly follows this trend of pounding momentum, yet with a touch more finesse and C-mass authenticity than the somewhat abysmal self-titled album. There are some excellent songs on this album, especially 'Embracing the Styx' which combines a stunning guitar riff with a dramatic vocal riff and lyrical motifs to 'die' for (although they've always had superb themes). \nEven though some tracks are a little bland (Demonia 6 doesn't bear a whole lot of scrutiny), Lowe's outstanding vocal performance makes it all worthwhile. His tone, so starkly different, nay, oppositional to Marcolin's, reminds us of deserts and dehydration, of rage and misery and many things Messiah's triumphal operatics struggle to convey. An added bonus on at least one version of the album are two 'vocal sessions with Robert Lowe', 'Solitude' and 'Gallow's End'. These I have probably played the most, obviously because they're classics, but believe me, he does them justice.\n\nThere are a couple of flaws to King of the Grey Islands, my chief complaint is the inexorable repetition of certain songs, for instance Demonia 6. I put this down to the band's veteran status (it's hard to write new material that's actually good), and the fact that the vocals were apparently recorded a continent away from the band under severe time pressure, considering which, they've produced a remarkable album.\n\nWithout dragging this out much further, I'd like to comment on Mappe Bjorkman's wierd and innovative guitar solos. The difference of Grey Islands is often most apparent when from the crushing bellows of the new sound flowers an absolutely authentic, arpeggiated solo that is unquestionably Candlemass in the oldest tradition. It's a very well played album, and I fervently hope for another, even fresher album in the next couple of years...\n",
        "\nSo here is where doom metal really started to get great. Bands like Sabbath and Pentagram definitely had mastered one aspect of what makes doom metal great, in that they had the insanely heavy riffs played at a slow pace almost down to a science, but they had yet to master the second aspect. That aspect is the epic feeling that most great doom albums have. This is where Candlemass really succeeds on this record, and they combine that aspect with a foreboding feeling of gloom. This album is excellent and it really took the genre of doom metal a step further. \n\nEvery song on this album is great. All of them have an overwhelmingly epic mood to them. The riffs move at a crawling pace and overflow with excellent melody. They are typically quite simple when it comes to technicality, but they\u2019re very complex in a songwriting sense. While the riffs aren\u2019t the most impressive in the department of sheer skill, the solos show that the guitarists are very skillful and every one of the solos sound great. The choruses are very strong and powerful and they reach epic levels that most bands couldn\u2019t reach with a 20 person choir singing behind them. Every one of them is extremely potent and exciting despite being as slow as a 300 pound child with Down syndrome. The drumming is very heavy and really good. Every snare hit and bass drum kick sound thunderous and provides great density to the music.\n\nA lot of Candlemass\u2019s greatness is rooted in the fact that Johan Lanquist is an excellent vocalist. He has a very forceful, deep singing voice that goes perfectly with the music. He had absolutely mastered the style in which he sings and he uses that style for most of the album, but at times he also shows that he is capable of hitting very high notes. \n\nThe title, and for that matter the genre, of this album suits it perfectly. While the album presents very epic instrumentation and singing, it counters it with a feeling of depression, despair, and doom. Every song presents an odd feeling of impending evil that envelopes the listener in intrigue, while the epic riffs and melodies provide something pleasing to hear to keep him/her listening. It is the perfect blend of atmosphere and substance. \n\nAs I have said, this album is excellent. Everything about it is great and it is not lacking in any aspect. All of the instruments are played very well and they all sound amazing. The vocalist has a near perfect voice and uses it well. The album is filled with epic music and songwriting, while the atmosphere suggests something much darker. This album is really spectacular and it is essential to any fan of doom metal.\n",
        "\nCandlemass is undoubtedly one of the most historic and legendary doom metal bands. For the majority of the fans of this particular metal genre, the announcement that Candlemass were reunited with their original line up was met with excitement and high expectations. However, some were more sceptical and had their doubts on whether Candlemass could reproduce the unique atmosphere they had in the past. I have to admit that I was among the sceptical ones: following the split-up of Candlemass after \u201cChapter VI\u201d, the members of the band decided to create their own bands. Nevertheless, these new bands never managed to reach the success that Canlemass had achieved, at least not in the commercial level. Leif Edling even reformed the band, with totally different members and a totally different musical approach, yet success still seemed to be out of reach. The sudden declaration that Candlemass were back once again with their original line up led me to the conclusion that the members of the band simply tried to take advantage of the name \u201cCandlemass\u201d in an effort to attract attention and regenerate their diminished popularity. \n\n\nOur fears were partially and temporarily falsified with the release of the album \u201cCandlemass\u201d in 2005. Although this new record could hardly be compared with the masterpieces the band had released during the \u201980s, it proved that Candlemass still had the ability to provide us with doom metal of high quality and interesting compositions. Nevertheless, the band would soon face a new difficulty: after the subsequent tours for the promotion of the new album, vocalist Messiah Marcolin decided to leave the group. Since the operatic style Messiah employed contributed essentially to the distinct sound of Candlemass, a lot of fans expressed feelings of uncertainty concerning the future of the band. Many thought that Candlemass had little to offer without Messiah. \n\n\nIt was obvious that finding a replacement for a singer as established and accomplished as Messiah would be no easy task. Leif Edling and the other members of Candlemass sought to recruit an experienced vocalist, whose abilities could not be questioned. Robert Lowe seemed to be the perfect choice, as he had served for long years in the underrated band of Solitude Aeturnus, always displaying excellent skills. Thus, with Robert Lowe as their lead vocalist, Candlemass recorded and released their next album, \u201cKing Of The Grey Islands\u201d. \n\n\nThe first impression one gets when examining \u201cKing Of The Grey Islands\u201d is that it is a very dark and gloomy record. The cover artwork is a plain picture of a skull bearing a crown, an image totally devoid of colour. The same colourless pattern is followed when it comes to the photographs of the band members. What is more, this pessimistic and broody atmosphere is evident in the musical content of the record. Indeed, if \u201cKing Of The Grey Islands\u201d were a painting, it would probably be black and white. This album is a musical manifestation of darkness, depression and solitude - nothing less than what is expected from a doom metal record. \n\nEven though the atmosphere of \u201cKing Of The Grey Islands\u201d is mostly reminiscent of \u201cEpicus Doomicus Metallicus\u201d, the songs themselves seem to be a combination between the \u201cNightfall\u201d and \u201cAncient Dreams\u201d periods of Candlemass. Heavy and mysterious guitar riffs that seem to drag themselves through the tracks, eerie parts with operatic vocals, melancholic and depressive lyrics that nevertheless include small hints of hope. As always, the influences from Black Sabbath constitute the main feature of Candlemass\u2019 music. The majority of the songs are inspired and enjoyable, proving that Leif Edling can still deliver excellent doom compositions. \u201cOf Stars And Smoke\u201d and \u201cEmbracing The Styx\u201d, for instance, could easily be included in a compilation of Candlemass\u2019 greatest songs. Robert Lowe\u2019s vocal contribution seems to have revived the band, adding a distinct quality to the final result. \u201cKing Of The Grey Islands\u201d gives a very clear and definite answer to the question whether Messiah could successfully be replaced.\n\n\nHowever, there is a flaw in Candlemass\u2019 current album, a flaw that constitutes the main reason why we\u2019re not dealing with an excellent record. More specifically, \u201cKing Of The Grey Islands\u201d is not only influenced from \u201cAncient Dreams\u201d or \u201cNightfall\u201d, but it is also extremely reminiscent of these albums, in a manner that becomes annoying at times. When listening to the tracks of Candlemass\u2019 recent album, a listener who is familiar with the former works of the group will sometimes get a feeling like \u201cwait a minute, I think I\u2019ve heard this riff before in the past\u201d. Once again, it is Robert Lowe that saves the day: had it not been for his excellent performance, which adds to the originality of the album\u2019s sound, then \u201cKing Of The Grey Islands\u201d would probably be considered a simple repetition of what Candlemass produced in past years. \n\n\nOverall, despite its minor flaws, \u201cKing Of The Grey Islands\u201d seems to be an encouraging step towards a right direction. If Candlemass take advantage of the skilful singer they now possess, and if they manage to sound a little bit more original, then they will surely create even greater albums and re-establish themselves as the absolute masters of European doom metal.\n",
        "\nCandlemass is a strange case. They have a singer regarded by many as \n\"iconic\" to the band, but unlike most bands with such a setup you can\naccept Candlemass without him pretty easily. Oh sure, Messiah Marcolin was a fantastic vocalist, but he just couldn't seem to hold his act together withCandlemass for more than one or two albums at a time (supposedly he's a big an assclown as he looks, but I digress) so he was never had the chance to be thought of as an irreplaceable element. It helps that Leif Edling has an uncanny knack for finding replacement singers who are just as talented, if not more so. Which brings us to Candlemass' most recent effort, King Of The Grey Islands.\n\nFirst off I must mention the album cover. Maybe it's the D&D nerd in me\nbut fuck me if that isn't the best cover I've seen all year. It fits the\nmusic perfectly, plus it avoids the too-much-information trap of so many metal covers and lets your mind fill in the blanks. I picture that skull attached to a purple robe-bedecked skeleton perched in a marble throne, still regal despite centuries of dust and decay, a glittering sword clutched in its hand. It's seated in a sealed tomb deep underground, surrounded by heaps of treasure accumulated through a lifetime of conquest and plunder--and ready to spring to life and swing that sword at the neck of anyone who fucks with ANY of it. Hope your cleric took the Greater Turning feat, fucko.\n\nAnyway. The album.\n\nFirst off: New singer Robert Lowe. He's just amazing. I've never heard \nSolitude Aeturnus so I didn't know what to expect, but goddamn if he\ndoesn't deliver. He manages the trick of taking after Ronnie James Dio without ripping him off. Unlike some falsettos I can name*cough*JamesLaBrie*cough* he actually SINGS, rather than show off with a lot of \"look how high I can scream!\" nonsense. He uses a lot more emotion than Messiah ever did, too. Perhaps most importantly, I can picture him singing any of the old stuff and doing right by it--I'd love to hear him sing \"Bewitched\". If the band happens to read this, a live album (heavy on Epicus and Tales of Creation songs) would be AWESOME.\n\nThe rest of the bands sounds great too--very riffy, but unlike some\ndoom bands they don't just play the same riff for minutes on end; they keep\nyou engaged. No matter how long any song on this album lasts, you never get the feeling that it's \"padded\". The lyrics are very fantasy-heavy, but the band handles them with such gravity and respect that they never devolve into power metal silliness--the absence of keyboards helps GREATLY in this. They never forget the gloom-n-doom atmosphere no matter what Lowe is singing about.\n\nMy personal favorite song on this album would have to be \"Of Stars And \nSmoke\". It's just such a perfect song, plus it encapsulates the current state of\nthe band so well.\n\nHighly, highly recommended.\n",
        "\nThese lines aren\u2019t intended to serve any other purpose than just expressing my opinion about an album that i had the chance to listen to.\n\nFirst of all, i have to say that i found nothing wrong with Marcolin\u2019s vocal performance, or at least nothing that would have imposed him being cast out of the band. Their previous album was kind of redundant and self-sufficient, but in the end it turned out decent enough. That probably has to be the actual reason for the band\u2019s decision to get a new vocalist. And so they did: King of the Grey Islands is the first release of the new Candlemass.\n\nNow for the album itself. The first thing that came in my mind when i heard this was the fact that their music is still heavy, reminding of the self-titled album. The musicianship remains good and solid throughout the whole 53 minutes, but i have to note that it is somewhat reminiscent of the 2005 work. As for the vocals, they are a strong point of this effort, as Lowe does a good job, his voice simply merges perfectly with the lyrics and the instrumental part to form a whole.\n\nEmperor of the Void is a masterpiece, clearly the best song in here, resuming very well what the band tried to do: heavy and dark doom metal, with deep and reflection-inducing lyrics. The riffs are cool and catchy and Robert Lowe\u2019s vocal performance is outstanding. The next track, Devil Seed, is also good, though weaker than the second one. The other songs are all decent, but nothing remarcable, except Clearsight, the second best out there. The instrumental intro leads to the searing vocals, which i dare to say are quite different from the second track, haunting the listener by actually being lighter, cleaner, but just as good.\n\nNow, the things i don\u2019t like. The music can get a bit monotonous at times, as there seems to be an almost invisible pattern that the band tends to follow. Demonia 6 is the weakest track, as i can\u2019t find anything in it to draw my attention. It\u2019s quite boring, and not even Lowe can save this one. Simply a filler. The instrumental is actually forgetable, too short and it just doesn\u2019t have any elements that would have made it noticeable. And i have to say that beside the vocal performance, which is certainly an improvement, the rest of it doesn\u2019t seem like progress to me. It\u2019s just the same Candlemass we know and love/hate (it is actually one of my favorite metal bands) with better vocals (sorry, Marcolin, but it\u2019s the truth!).\n\nFinally, the two bonus tracks seem to me useless and very weak. Marcolin did do, at the time being, a good job with those two songs, especially Solitude, which i dare to say is classic Candlemass. I don\u2019t see the point of re-recording something that is already done as good as it could have ever been done just for the sake of having Lowe\u2019s performance replace the old vocals, as the aforementioned tracks belong to a closed chapter in the band\u2019s history. He\u2019s very good, i can\u2019t deny that, but his voice just doesn\u2019t match those songs, let\u2019s leave it to that.\n\nTo sum it all up, a good album, but not excellent. If you like Candlemass and want a doom metal album worth the money, buy this one!\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s been a turbulent and weird era for Candlemass with all these things around the fact that Messiah Marcolin eventually left the band, after reading many interviews with the bandleader Leif Edling it\u2019s obvious that he and the guys in the band doesn\u2019t like Messiah at all, and have never really done. So Messiah left the building, but who really thought Candlemass would call it quits just because of that? Exactly, nobody! So they tested a whole bunch of vocalist but didn\u2019t find what they looked for, and as a gift from heaven there was one day some news on their homepage saying that Robert Lowe of SOLITUDE AETURNUS was their new vocalist. Some were sceptic, but some felt directly that this is exactly what C-mass need. And yes, this new disc of doom shows: Candlemass are back and they are stronger than ever, and Robert is the best vocalist that has ever sung for this band.\n\nWith Candlemass we always know that we get heavy doom music with gloomy and phenomenal lyrics. The band has an excellent songwriter and bassplayer in form of Leif, a superb guitar duo, a solid drummer...and now one of the best vocalists in metal. The performance Robert does on the album can be described with one word: divine, it even outmatches his performance on the latest SA-album \u201cAlone\u201d. On \u201cK.O.T.G.I.\u201d he sings with much rawer and darker vocals to fit in with the aggressive music, but still he manages to sing with so much variation and mixes with some SA-kind of singing here and there, which really makes this to his best performance. The music, compared to 2005\u2019s S/T-album, is much more dynamic and \u2018big\u2019-sounding, and as Leif has said; it\u2019s also more metal. After hearing the verses of \u201cEmperor of the Void\u201d the first time I understood directly that this would be the darkest C-mass album so far, and it is. Not only musicwise, but also the lyrical part. Leif says he doesn\u2019t care too much about the lyrics when writing an album, I find this strange, since he always writes so awesome lyrics. Most songs on this albums are about mankind...what can be more gloomy and depressing? Critisiscm is spitted out towards certain people, the society we live in and what we do to our planet and ourselves. And no one do this better than Leif, when it comes for lyrics to songs. Some great songs can be found on here and thing is that there\u2019s not a single weak track, except the maybe too monotonous \u201cDemonia 6\u201d.\n\nThe band seems happy with the situation, they\u2019re feeling enthusiastic and want to get on the road with Robert, it\u2019s obvious, Candlemass are hungry...and I can understand it. With such a great album as this, who can be anything else than happy? There\u2019s some songs on here that can be counted as the best C-mass have written (\u201cClearsight\u201d and \u201cEmbracing The Styx\u201d) and i\u2019m happy with Leif\u2019s writing, that he can keep such a high level of greatness on every album in the last years. While it\u2019s not really beating some of their older albums, this one is still very close and is absolutely up there in the top of this band\u2019s albums. This is a must for every Candlemass as well as Solitude Aeturnus fan...or let\u2019s just say: anyone that is into doom!\n",
        "\nCan Candlemass survive without Messiah Marcolin? I have never had any doubts about that myself anyway. Their number one classic (\u2018Epicus Doomicus Metallicus\u2019) had Johan Langqvist singing and the first album after Messiah\u2019s first departure (\u2018Chapter VI\u2019) wasn\u2019t only handled very capably by Thomas Vikstr\u00f6m, but also has some of the band\u2019s best songs to date. Replacing Messiah this time is Doom Metal singer number one, Solitude Aeturnus-singer Robert Lowe. And no disrespect to Messiah, but I hope he won\u2019t return this time. Because what Robert Lowe did on this album is bordering on the incredible.\n\nNot only does Lowe do an outstanding job on \u2018King Of The Grey Islands\u2019, the whole band is in a shape I never thought they would be capable of. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have loved Candlemass in every incarnation they have had so far, but it seems like they\u2019re breaking all the boundaries they set themselves with this album. Helped by a production that is guarateed to blow your mind, Candlemass lets nothing hold them back this time. The result is a stellar album, which is \u2013 who would have thought? \u2013 even surprising at times!\n\nAfter a slightly unnecessary intro, the opening riff of \u2018Emperor Of The Void\u2019 blasts through either your speakers or headphones. It was the latter for me. I was heading for the mall on my bicycle when this amazing riff came on. I stopped for a minute, took my headphones off, said \u201choly shit!\u201d, put my headphones back on and cycled further. It was that strong. Something about this song already shows you this album is going to be more powerful than what you\u2019re used to from Candlemass. Part of that is definitely Robert Lowe\u2019s vocals. Where Messiah would probably have done these vocal lines operatically, Lowe adds a certain, creepy atmosphere to the whole thing. And let\u2019s not forget that amazing chorus!\n\nSee, I\u2019ve mentioned a chorus already! I would hardly do that with Candlemass, because \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 they hardly had any outstanding choruses in the past (\u2018Demon\u2019s Gate\u2019 maybe...), but this album is full of them. Memorable, but never cheesy. I heard a sample of \u2018Of Stars And Smoke\u2019 on the Candlemass MySpace several days prior to buying the album and it somehow didn\u2019t do much to me. I can\u2019t remember why and I can\u2019t understand either, because \u2018Of Stars And Smoke\u2019 has \u2013 by far! \u2013 the best chorus in any Candlemass song. The pre-chorus to \u2018Devil Seed\u2019 is getting a hold of you and never letting go material as well. Singing along and banging your head have never been combined so naturally as on this album.\n\nThough Leif Edling will always do whatever it takes to keep Candlemass and Krux apart two separate bands \u2013 my hope that Mats Lev\u00e9n would become the new Candlemass-singer was not answered due to that reason \u2013 there definitely are some references to Krux\u2019s sound at some moments on this album. Most of that is caused by Carl Westholm\u2019s keyboards. His subtle sense of psychedelia really makes some points on this album shine even more than they already would have done without those keyboards. Take \u2018Man Of Shadows\u2019 for instance, there\u2019s this pre-chorus that appears only once in the entire song with acoustic guitars and keyboard work that can\u2019t do anything else than causing goosebumps. The part reminds me of the pre-chorus to \u2018I Still See The Black\u2019 from \u2018Dactylis Glomerata\u2019 somehow. \u2018Man Of Shadows\u2019 probably has Lars Johansson\u2019s best guitar solos to date as well.\n\nBut the best treat of this album is saved for last. Is \u2018Embracing The Styx\u2019 the best Candlemass-song to date? If you ask me...maybe \u2018At The Gallow\u2019s End\u2019 is the only serious competition for that! \u2018Embracing The Styx\u2019 is really the \u00fcber-doomsong that many bands in the genre wish they had made. It\u2019s a bit Krux-ish too. The intro riff just kills you, I promise you. And if it wasn\u2019t atmospheric enough, Carl Westholm hits the ground note on the piano and adds some of his typical synths to make it even better. Then there\u2019s Robert Lowe, who is all over the place on this one, especially on the mighty chorus, and Leif Edling even has a bass solo! Now, usually, I\u2019m not really into bass solos \u2013 please note that I am in fact a bass player! \u2013 but this one fits the mood of the song perfectly. The acoustic outro with Lowe\u2019s beautiful vocals rounds the album off in perfect fashion.\n\nIf you have the digipack version, you will get two more tracks. Both are re-recordings of classic Candlemass songs. The songs sound a bit odd because the guitars are tuned lower than the original versions and I suddenly noticed that Mats Bj\u00f6rkman and Lars Johansson have a completely different way of playing rhythm guitar. There are no overdubs, as can be heard in a few minor mistakes in the songs, so I guess these are quite professional rehearsal recordings. The true reason to get these recordings is that Robert Lowe is singing on them. The songs are \u2018Solitude\u2019 and \u2018At The Gallows End\u2019. And he first thing I think when I hear Lowe singing these tunes is: \u201cMessiah who?\u201d.\n\nLeif Edling will probably never agree with me on this one, but it\u2019s Messiah Marcolin\u2019s fault this album is so good. The music was already completed long before he left the band and he could only have fucked up the whole thing. \u2018King Of The Grey Islands\u2019 really confirms my idea that Messiah was holding them back. The album has all the elements I was missing in \u201cclassic Candlemass\u201d. Suddenly the band dares to experiment. There are, for instance, more acoustic guitars and keyboards than on any previous Candlemass-album and there are more unusual song sructures for a Doom band here. This is definitely the most progressive album the band has made so far. And if that isn\u2019t already enough, there\u2019s still Robert Lowe, who delivers another proof of why he is the ultimate Doom singer.\n\nMy retailer, who had a promo of the album for a long time already, had been teasing me, telling me \u2018King Of The Grey Islands\u2019 is such an amazing album, for a long time prior to the release, as he knows that I\u2019m not downloading, but I can only say he\u2019s right. This might just be my album of the year! And maybe even the best Doom album ever? Not sure about that, but it\u2019s definitely right up there with Solitude Aeturnus\u2019 \u2018Into The Depths Of Sorrow\u2019 and Krux\u2019s self titled debut for me. And it\u2019s the ultimate proof of my statement that Doom Metal, when executed right, can be just as good as Thrash Metal. \u2018King Of The Grey Islands\u2019 is not only recommended, it\u2019s obligatory for anyone who loves Heavy Metal.\n",
        "\nAn ominous, delicately-picked acoustic intro, supplemented by swelling church organs marks the start of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, one of the more appropriately named albums ever to be committed to tape. Solitude is the song, and in many ways, this is Candlemass's signature song. The intro soon makes way for a truly monstrous riff, and Johan Lanquist's mighty tenor vocals. The slightly cliched nature of the lyrics: 'Earth to earth, ashes to ashes etc', ripped by many a metal band from the Anglican funeral service matter little when delivered with this much emotion and power, and with the spiralling lead lending a strange air of deautiful despondency to proceedings, Solitude turns full circle, concluding with a lone voice backed by an acoustic, imploring some form of higher power to 'Please let [him] die in solitude'.\n\nThe rest of the album is built around equally molten riffage, with Demon's Gate and Crystal Ball in particular revealing bounty indeed for those of us who live for the riff. Keyboards and clean guitars are sprinkled throughout the album, but never dominate the guitars and vocals, adding a real sense of tension through dynamics that all classic metal records should exhibit, but sadly few do these days.\n\nAlthough held up by many as bastions of true doom, and not to say that there aren't doom moments to be found here, Candlemass have always emphasized the metal side of their personality above all else. Black Stone Wielder has it's relatively fast and chuggy moments, and A Sorceror's pledge could even be said to raise a gallop at times. There's also a strong neo-classical feel to much of the guitar work, with the counterpoint melodies of the latter half of Under The Oak providing one of the albums best musical passages.\n\nEpicus is a great album for several reasons. Firstly, the songs are just so strong. Where so many albums strive unsuccessfully to create so much as a handful of memorable moments, Candlemass's debut burns song after song, melody after melody into your soul, from almost the first listen. Secondly, the tones of the guitars, and the overall sound and atmosphere create the indefinable arcane aura of true heavy metal that just can't be faked. Epicus... possesses a classicism that fits it straight into an impeccable metal lineage, starting at Sabbath, and proceeding through Pentagram and Cirith Ungol, to the present day standard bearers like Reverend Bizarre and Solitude Aeturnus. Yes there are some metal cliches at work here, and well-worn melodic patterns, but the overall effect is so spell-binding that you would swear that Candlemass did it first, and everyone else copied them.\n\nCandlemass would go on to record another trio of very good albums, as well as a fine comeback record in 2005, but as a definitive encapsulation of their fundamental sound, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is very hard to beat.\n",
        "\nThis album took a while for me to get into at first because I had to become adjusted to Robert Lowe being on vocals as apposed to Eddie. However, after giving this album a worthy chance I was turned from a hater to a lover. Once I was able to grow accustom to Robert Lowe's vocals on this record I was able to sit back and appreciate how truly incredible this release is.\n\nPicking up right were they left off, Candlemass brings us King of the Grey Islands, which has a great mix of songs which have clean guitar interludes, driving riffs, some smooth flowing drumming and some interesting effects that provide something different to an already fantastic album.\n\nAs mentioned previously it did take me a while to grow accustom to Robert Lowe filling in the vocal position on this release, but after giving this album an honest judgment, listening to it through stereo speakers and headphones (the final test) I came to the understanding that there would be no one better to fill the vocal position.\n\nSurely, anyone who is already a fan of Candlemass will love this record as it provides everything that a good Candlemass record has, and for those who have yet to hear this great band I urge you to give this record a chance and you may just become a Candlemass fan.\n",
        "\nI'll keep it concise to keep the expectation high. At the same time, I will state a few things that will add to the curiosity.\n\nFirst, I've liked Candlemass in the past, but nothing more than getting the albums and throwing them around for an occasional spin. The songs, including the classics, would get a bit boring after a while. I have all of their albums, but can't listen to them for too long at a stretch at the risk of never listening to them again.\n\nI acquired an advance of King of the Grey Islands. At this point, I know little more about Robert Lowe, their new vocalist from Solitude Aeturnus, than a few casual listens of the SA albums. I didn't know what to expect and if he could fit in Messiah's role. From the outset, Leif Edling appears to have done a thorough freshening of the Candlemass sound and direction, Lowe being an integral part of it. His voice and singing style offers more diversity to fit into (finally!) more varied music than they have done in the past. Several days ago Marcolin commented that he wanted to retain \"a more traditional\" direction for the Candlemass sound, while the band wanted to progress. Luckily, the band won the vote. \n\nThe music is finally more dynamic and changes tempo a more than I can remember. It's heavy, drums are real heavy, the songs are not monotoned, and they are exhibiting fine musicianship they rarely did in the past. Some have mentioned that their musical direction is a bit like Edling's other band, Krux, whom I have not yet heard. Some might be scared off thinking without Messiah and a different direction they won't be Candlemass. Don't worry. They sound like Candlemass, but with a freshened sound, through which they are likely to realize more creative satisfaction while distancing themselves from the safe, \"sterile\" sound of their self-titled 2006 album. By comparison, the highest rating I would have given any other Candlemass album is in the sixties.\n\nCandlemass seems to be experimenting more, added more ambience, stepped up the vocals from a safe, straightforward direction, and could perhaps redefine modern \"traditional\" doom metal, while keeping it very heavy. I don't feel Marcolin would fit in with this album. Not only was his singing style somewhat restrictive for the music it would be mated to, he seems to have been creatively restrictive. Lowe appears to have brought new life to this 25 year old band and allowed Edling to persue a fresher direction in doom metal and helped produce the best album in Candlemass' history. \n\nI have had \"Demonia 6\" playing in my car for the last two days straight.\n",
        "\nWow, this has to be the heaviest Candlemass album to date. This is certainly my favorite album along with Nightfall. Although, this is completely different from Nightfall.\nMaybe this s/t is slightly comparable to a few choice tracks off of Chapter IV, granted this production is superior and a far more consistent album on a whole. Having Messiah back in the fold makes all the difference in the world.\n\nThis is his finest vocal performance since Nightfall. What I mean is that he is singing more within the song. I have often thought to my self that he tends to over sing on \"Ancient Dreams\" and \"Tales..\". Too much vibrato, Messiah would often sound like he was trying out for the opera. I guess that is like saying to a lead guitar player, \"you're playing too many notes\". Too much wanking, if you will. Yes, you have the talent, but it doesn't quite fit the song. \n\nOkay, saying all that, when Messiah is on his game he is the best. He hasn't necessarily toned down on this album, all the energy is still there, rather he sounds much more pissed-off and aggressive. Listen to Witches and it sounds like he never has in the past, and it sounds fucking great.\n\nThese songs are all fucking heavy. Maybe Lief's side project band Krux rubbed off a little. The opening riff in \"Copernicus\", is a skull crusher. It goes from the heaviest shit you can imagine, to a softer passage, back into the heaviness. Brilliantly executed. Just a fucking fantastic song. \"Black Dwarf \"has that \"Symptom of the Universe\" pulse to it. Along with \"Born in a Tank\" are the only real Sabbath vibe songs here. It is still total Candlemass though, not like the Sabbath worship found on \"From the 13th Sun\". All the tracks are good on this album, except the instrumental I could pass on. \"Seven Silver Keys\" is the most reminiscent of the past. Messiah singing like the glory days in this melodic number. Probably the most melodic song on the album. Nice use of atmosphere with the keyboard. \n\nThe keyboard wasn't really introduced into Candlemass until Chapter IV. More or less used as a backdrop. Had Messiah sang on Chapter IV I think it would've been much better. Not to knock on the previous singers, but Candlemass seemed to fade into oblivion after he left. Well, at least for me. Its too bad Messiah left the band again. No one was able to fill his shoes in the past, and it looks like they shouldn't make that mistake again. I look forward to hearing them team up with the powerful voice from Solitude Aeternus. \n\nWell, at least they'll go out on a high note with this classic lineup. The last word has already been written about this album a thousand times, but I don't care. If you got this far then maybe you're interested in seeking out this album. I hope to one day see this revered with the classics. If you're unfamiliar with this band, then you can do no wrong with starting here. Try and find the Digipack with the bonus track on it. After that buy Nightfall and Epicus, then thank me later and buy me a beer.\n",
        "\n\u2018Candlemass\u2019 is back\u2026 and with the best album since 1989\u2019s \u2018Tales Of Creation.\u2019 Honestly, I had both high hopes and doubts about this album. I wasn\u2019t very psyched about the Candlemass releases after 1990, but here, Messiah Marcolin was on vocals once again. With him singing, what could go wrong? Fortunately, very little did go wrong.\n\nThe band is back to their old style, as could be heard on classics such as \u2018Nightfall\u2019 and \u2018Epicus Doomicus Metallicus.\u2019 The great catchy riffs are back, vocals amazing, and Marcolin\u2019s voice didn\u2019t seem to have weakened at all. The same power and commanding in his voice is still there, as are both the familiar and loved high-octave vocals, and some lower ones, which add more singing variety to the album than to the previous Candlemasses.\n\nThe riffs are back and (dare I say?) they\u2019re better than ever. Great melodies, catchy rhythms, same heavy distorted noises as always. They remind me of classic Black Sabbath on this release more than on any other Candlemass, and manage to create the same unforgettable atmospheres as Iommi in classics like \u2018Paranoid.\u2019 The amazing production of this album makes this fact ever better. The guitars are perfectly mixed with the drums and vocals, and the bass on here is about as close to perfect as you can possibly get.\n\nChoruses are also catchy as hell, sounding epic and legendary like always. Candlmass matured by miles, and that is clean on this album. Supplying with a lot more sophisticated songwriting than I ever anticipated, this was yet another good surprise for me. Every time you listen to this album, it grows on you some more, and you notice something fresh and new. This is one of those few albums I can put on repeat and listen through a couple times without starting to get bored.\n\nThe godfathers of Epic Doom metal definitely didn\u2019t disappoint me with this release. If anything, my liking of this band doubled. Just when I didn\u2019t think they had anything left in them, they managed to supply me with yet another pleasant surprise. Candlemass is back\u2026 and better than ever!!!\n\n-Marcin C.\n",
        "\n\"I'm sitting here alone in darkness \nwaiting to be free, \nLonely and forlorn I'm crying \nI long for my time to come \ndeath means just life \nPlease let me die in solitude \"\n\nAnd so begins one of the pinnacle albums of the entire European doom scene, Epicus Doomicus Meticallus. Candlemass\u2019 debut album truly set the bar for future albums in this genre and really paved the way for such bands as Cathedral, Paradise Lost, and Electric Wizard. Candlemass take what Black Sabbath were doing circa Heaven and Hell to the next logical step. Epic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what these Swedes were conducting on this album. Take the opening intro to the song \u201cSolitude\u201d I quoted at the beginning of this review. It begins with a deceptive acoustic guitar fiddling away as a voice akin to a lost soul calls out for his own death, immediately following this come the guitars crashing down. A truly monstrous riff is unleashed and they have reached limits previous unheard of in levels of heaviness. Heaviness that wouldn\u2019t be topped until possibly Cathedral\u2019s debut album.\n\nThe album truly never lets up. The follow up to \u201cSolitude\u201c, \u201cDemon\u2019s Gate\u201d opens with a rather cheesy low frequency voice over almost as cheesy synthesizers, but after that part the guitars come ripping in and we have another doom classic on our hands. Demon\u2019s Gate is over nine minutes of pure doom, with the basis of the song being the simple, but moving drum line that tends to plod along but erupts with double bass or quick drumming at various times. There song has an extremely lengthy instrumental break that stays true to the purpose of doom metal in the fact that it is heavy and relentless. \u201cCrystal Ball\u201d isn\u2019t quite as good as the two previous tracks, perhaps because of a lack of a strong vocalist. Original vocalist Johan Lanquist lacks a strong set of pipes, especially when compared to Messiah Marcolin, the person who took over for him in the band. Lanquist tends to employ a kind of whine, when this sort of song requires something powerful and soaring because of the fact that the song is essentially vocal based. However, the music is still amazing and there is an almost thrash break around halfway through the song that is truly magnificent. \u201cBlack Stone Wielder\u201d is a standout track with its pounding riff and propelling bass, however it lacks the variation that the previous tracks had with the exception of an absolutely lethal break about two-thirds into the song. The final two songs \u201cUnder the Oak\u201d and \u201cA Sorcerer\u2019s Pledge\u201d are pretty much just doom metal standards, but still solid in their own rights. They just don\u2019t sound as groundbreaking as the opening few tracks are.\n\nThe sound on this album is slightly above average for a fairly underground band in 1986. The guitars could sound heavier, and the bass could definitely be given a boost as far as sound is concerned as well. The drums and vocals are both well-recorded though. If their was one thing they could have done production-wise it would be to up the bass and make it more prominent. It would certainly help as far as enhancing the heaviness of the album. Otherwise I have to commend the production talents at work here.\n\nIn conclusion, this album truly redefined what doom metal was. By taking the Sabbath blueprint and melding it with some underground metal sources (bits and pieces of Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate certainly are apparent) they truly paved the way for the epic doom metal of the future. Get a hold of this album, you will not regret it. It is an important step in the evolution of doom metal, and is an excellent listen. It has hardly aged.\n",
        "\nAfter the departure of Messiah nobody wanted to pay attention to Candlemass anymore. The fan-base had always in mind that without the \"fat-guy\" Candlemass could not exist. They were wrong! I can't refuse that Messiah is the best singer they had ever had, but this doesn't mean that Thomas Vikstrom had no value. He is really a very good singer with a rather power metal/heavy (not operatic) voice which is different to that of Messiah, but it is still great and technically perfect. He has also a lot of passion and emotion to support the difficult task to wear Messiah's shoes. \n\nApart from the new singer, another new element is the addition of few keyboards that wisely serve the band's purpose to create atmosphere. The rest of the players (the classic line-up of musicians, with only Messiah out) are well-known for their good chemistry, so they didn't disappoint me. The group's direction remains epic doom, but with a bit more emphasis to the word \"epic\", than \"doom\". The lyrics are about mythology (mostly pagan, not only christian!) or romantic metal themes with nostalgia about the thrills of the past, or insecurity for humanity's future. \n\nThere are times that you can find some power metal influences, without sacrificing the band's gloomy, dark and doom image. It is not only about songwriting (this record had first been written for Messiah's voice), but mostly about the singer's vocal style. \n\nIf it hadn't been for the band's past with Messiah, this album would have been considered a classic. It has everything: killer riffs, strong songwriting, a nice singer who suffered the Messiah-syndrome of both fans and critics and a very good production that offers us the possibility to enjoy all players giving the 100% of their efforts. \n\nThe band was also willing to step forward. And suprisingly they did it! They nearly abandoned the christian themes, embracing pagan romanticism, they became more atmospheric, the whole concept makes you feel that you are part of an epic story of the past travelling in time (especially in tracks such as \"Where the runes still speak\", or \"Temple of the dead\"), being at the same time darker than ever (though less dynamic), they added keyboards... \n\nThe similarities between this album and the previous stuff are not so many, but suprisingly it remains Candlemass, thanks to the musicians who remain the same and in good shape. Only after Lars' and Mappe's departure the Candlemass sound becomes unrecognisable, until their return. \n\nConclusion: Be open-minded and you will realise that it's a KILLER!\n",
        "\nMany fans of the classic Messiah era will be deeply disappointed. The only surviving member of the old good times is Leif Edling, the music direction is more psychedelic doom (with no epic doom elements), the new singer is completely different to Messiah (he sounds like a successful clone of Ozzy), the new guitarist has an experimental (though still doom to the core) style that has no relation to Mappe's classic riffs and Lars' thunderous solos, the production is rather \"modern\" featuring FX and atmospheric parts and the overall impression is that only the name remained and we have in fact a diferent group using the same moniker. \n\nHowever, Leif respects the legend of this group better than any other. He didn't use crap in order to exploit the name of the band, but top material as always. He wanted to pay a tribute to his most beloved group of the past Black Sabbath with an album which have the most influences derived from the classic BS stuff. He also hired a vocalist that he sounds like the twin brother of Ozzy with a rather electric, atmospheric (and a bit stoned) voice. \n\nWhen I first heard this record I supposed that it was something like Black Sabbath rip off, with a bit more depressive mood. Indeed, \"Tot\" for example have the same structure as \"Black Sabbath\": Bell's tolls and the sounds of the rain as an indroduction, slow-tempo horror-like singing at the middle and it ends with a monstrous guitar explosion. There were times that I wondered if I was listening to Candlemass, or Black Sabbath's debut or Vol. 4, with some more modern sound. But after listening to it more than two times, I started to recognise also the space rock influences that made this album so psychedelic. Sometimes the Hawkwind-Sabbath combination makes this album sound more stoner than doom. \n\nAny novelty? The lyrics! They are so psychedelic and mad that if you read them, without listening to the music you may think that they are pessimistic nonsense. But they fit the album's mood, a total confusion both musically and lyrically, that creates an unique atmosphere, a very dangerous experimentation that only mr. Edling could make under a legendary name without being humiliated by the result. \n\nIn conclusion, this is the album that Black Sabbath sould have released after their reunion, but they never did it. But it doesn't matter. Their tradition is being continued even under the name Candlemass!\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026proud of his art is the carpenter, his creation a tool for my doom\u2026\u201d\n\nFor hooked Candlemass fans, it probably doesn't seem like there\u2019s much going on here, what with top dog \u201cAt the Gallows End\u201d lifted from the already existing Nightfall lp and two of the shorter tracks from Epicus Doomicus Metallicus by now three years past, but if you were teary-eyed for the band by this point, you\u2019d be aware it\u2019s Messiah and his dramaturgic tones that\u2019s ensorcelling the old stalwarts. Well, it made it worth a listen anyway. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always thought this and its sister disc, the Samarithan single/ep, should\u2019ve predated the enigmatic Nightfall, and, to me anyway, the obvious reason is purely for introduction. The cover sticker announces that the pair of churners from EDM have been \u201cre-recorded especially to add the heavy touch of vocalist Messiah Marcolin\u201d (spelled Maroolin \u2013 betcha he was happy). My plan would\u2019ve been an alternate sticker, larger than the existing 3x2\u201d one, and arcing across it in a boldly big feudal-style font would be something like \u201cThe Messiah has Arisen!\u201d. Then top it off with a complimentary blurb about his Mercy heritage and maybe, and I mean maybe, a live shot of the guy decked out in his lofty yet understated monk\u2019s attire, rope belt and all, at the center of a full-bore, jaw-wide wail, perhaps clutching some sort of gothic trinket\u2026yeah I know, very eighties. Well if the shoe fits, and this guy hefted his big butt right into the role without hesitation. In fact, word has it Eddie called Leif upon hearing about the band\u2019s vocal witch hunt, proclaiming (I imagined he sung it into the receiver, which is in fact what happened I would later learn) that the search was indeed over, and before the bassist was barely off the phone the mad monk was driving over not to audition, but to stride in as savior. With this forerunner reasoning, while the faves from the debut are reinvented for old fans, unreleased doozy \u201cAt the Gallows End\u201d would\u2019ve thrown awareness over the edge, with its bulging chorus alone making it worthy of the $5.49 I dished out for it. Same would\u2019ve gone for the Samarithan effort, which other than the title track featured the same playlist. \n\nBut in the real world this saw daylight about eight months after Nightfall. Kind of anticlimactic, but hearing the lyrics of \u201cSolitude\u201d and \u201cCrystal Ball\u201d traipse across their doom landscape in nobles\u2019 clothing is cool enough for the price of admission, though in the end, the tribulation that crawls through the original works wins out, with Lanquist\u2019s imperfect descants being actually more precise for the cause. Then again, I\u2019m sure there\u2019re people who feel the opposite. \n\nApparently the momentous \u201cBattlecry\u201d was worthy of neither disc. I still can\u2019t figure that out. \n\n\u201c\u2026I have seen it all, dreamt away through the crystal ball\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\nHow often does a band try something really fresh and innovative instead of copying the thrills of the past after a reunion? Some guys prefer not to release anything in the fear of destroying their legend (the original Black Sabbath), or they create something uninspired and unoriginal, with old and repetitive ideas and cliches in order to please their fans (Judas Priest). \n\nThat's not the case of Candlemass! Abandoning part of their early epic feeling and the religious, mythological, or fantasy themes they focus, for the first time in their history, on the drama of every-day life and agony. More doom than epic the new Candlemass sound darker than ever before. It seems that the change of Leif Edling's philosophical approach (he does not accept any metaphysical explanation about the human fate) affected the music itself. It is very interesting to hear the lyrics of \"Born in a tank\" for example, a song talking about a man buried in the fake safety of his home, being in fact imprisoned by the politics. No more devils or angels, no Satan or God, but just human beings... \n\nDon't expect the thunderous enthusiasm of previous albums such as \"Nightfall\". What someone should expect from some guys around 45 is maturity, not youthfull energy. Candlemass are more sophisticated than ever before, with the intention to speak out the truth. The result of this effort is breathtaking. Although Messiah does not use all his vocal range (like his singing during '80's), he prefers to insist on darker vocals that fit perfectly the mood of this album. The other players have retained their dexterity and good shape and, most of all, they have chemistry. You cannot pay attention to the good work of a single musician, but to the whole music in general. It gives me the impression that not even a single note is unnecessary. \n\nI strongly believe that this album is their best. I didn't realise it at the first time I heard it, but after some more careful listenings I understood why the best albums are the growers, not the instant thrills. When you want to express something deep and original, there is no way to make it easier, in order to be understood by the idiots or the lazy ones.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026only the vultures will come to see me hang\u2026\u201d\n\nYou can call it history. You can call it history that early sludge vindicators Mercy were the sharpening stone for a voice already edged with vivid, booming eloquence. \n\nYou can call it coincidence. You can call it coincidence that Mercy and Nemesis/Candlemass tread the same Swedish mire, both chest deep and in echoing earshot, powerless to ignore the other\u2019s rise in underground magnitude. \n\nYou can call it fate. You can call it fate that Mercy would splinter under its own planetary bulk after two albums just as Candlemass invokes its own gravitational pull. \n\nSo here we are, on the cusp of what will be a grand relationship between a most promising Swedish band and a vocalist that was already overflowing with talent most uncommon. The only people who could\u2019ve seen something startling right around the bend were those fans of both bands, few as they were compared to mainstream affairs, but the rest of us would catch this contagious syndrome quickly, this confrontation between two irresistible, symbiotic forces.\n\nAnd this...this you can call doom. \n\n\u201c\u2026the priest he will pray for my lost soul\u2026I\u2019m sure he\u2019s wasting his time\u2026\u201d\n\nCome \u201986, mind and mouth meet, probably not for the first time, but in this instance it\u2019s for the sake of unemployment, necessity, proximity, and obvious kinship. Spark between the two seems inevitable, if not personally then musically. Old songs are laid with shiny new pipes. Canticles barely explored by Edling, the band\u2019s creative vortex, find matrimony with a creamy voice of glory, a voice that can easily be seen billowing from a figure perched high on a snow-capped mountain peak, frost on his breath, hand raised as if to clutch a goblet of white faith or a skull of dark despair. Y\u2019see, the band already had a sculptor of words in Edling, perhaps one of the most gifted of metal\u2019s fantasy-focused wordsmiths, and these words swirled majestic whether rising from Johan Lanquist\u2019s impoverished cries or the bassist\u2019s own lips. But these verses deserved a declaration transcending the two vocalists\u2019 famished beggar\u2019s character, the hand-to-mouth existence of a pauper trudging the alleys of the river district. They needed a new lease on life. They needed an entrance to elegance, an upholder of the story. Well, they got one, their own messiah \u2013 all dauntless, frizzed, monked-out, 250+ lbs of him. \n\nWhat this meeting awakened is more than something born out of a spirit-dampened virulence honed by Sabbath, Saint Vitus, Trouble, Witchfinder General, and of course, Candlemass\u2019 cement-legged debut and Mercy\u2019s past artifacts. Nightfall vitalizes and depresses simultaneously like an ornate crest on mace-crushed armor, thudding together seamlessly and painlessly. It pays tribute to Epicus Doomicus Metallicus by not swaying the doom balance and enhancing its elaborate carnage with a voice that can accompany kings as they stride to their thrones. Like the squalling start of \u201cGothic Stone\u201d, it\u2019s where heaven and hell meet, \u2018cos it\u2019ll be a cold day in hell when someone\u2019s gonna convince me this melding of incorruptible alto and grandiose, yet disheartened atmosphere isn\u2019t a match made in heaven. \n\nMessiah Marcolin is trained in the operatic arts. So are hundreds of other metal mouthpieces, but while most trained (opera or otherwise) vocalists send notes into the clouds with regularity, Messiah resists all that, for he targets the short expanse of alto, the highest male pitch sung by a bonafide opera singer, and only a short, lonely list of crooners can share the portly one\u2019s scale to any length. He\u2019s a copier of no one, and I\u2019ve yet to hear a singer that aurally resembles the mad monk\u2019s obscure talent or resonance to any close degree. \n\n\u201c\u2026no one would share my last chalice, so I drink to the ones that I know\u2026\u201d\n\nWith this forlorn ten-track campaign, Edling and his accomplished group take their beloved doom to its already memorable heights of isolation, enchantment, mourning, and hope, concocting substance not unusual for the style, but with dressed songcraft, absorbing lyrics, exploratory vocals, and Lars Johansson\u2019s regal solos, this four-way union certainly conveys that presence. Here, story and song use the same respiratory system to survive. Imagery is not a babbling dash of thoughts masquerading as cohesion. With Nightfall and Candlemass, it is lifeblood. \n\n\u201cThe Well of Souls\u201d and its preface, \u201cGothic Stone\u201d, entangle faithfulness and impending peril in their combined age, the latter giving birth to an atmosphere of angels choiring softly as if not to stir a chorus that slowly, menacingly, rises from its knees, like an elder rewarning against a terrible prophecy as the being who is destined to fulfill it continues walking forward. Imagery. Titanic \u201cSamarithan\u201d is snail-slow and pillar-heavy, the tale of a tatterdemalion\u2019s stroke of luck as a wealthy stranger takes him in, and then that stranger\u2019s ascent to heaven for the deed is food for the mind's eye, meanwhile high-flown tandem guitars between verses glide hot and electrified. \u201cMourner\u2019s Lament\u201d, a tune the band save Messiah despise playing live, is a heartfelt quasi-epic chimed by lyrics earnest and pleading, meanwhile \u201cDark are the Veils of Death\u201d and \u201cBewitched\u201d can beguile with their unorthodox pace changes and rhythm shifts that are the hallmarks of inspired songwriting. But outweighing them all is the lp\u2019s tour de force, the ode to treason \u201cAt the Gallows End\u201d. Once again the story runs neck and neck with rhythms that about-face on a dime. The chorus soars with a strange triumphant despair and looks to the sky as if to defeat it. Some of the album\u2019s most provocative lyrics lie here and lead you to believe that he in the story who is waiting for death knows it is deserved. \n\nMaking up much of the remainder is what can only be dubbed as filler tunes, albeit short ones. There\u2019s no way around this branding really, criminal when thinking of the breadth this lp throbs with, and I often wonder what really could\u2019ve emerged as Nightfall if a collective 6+ minutes had been more than a famed Chopin interpretation (\u201cMarche Funebre\u201d \u2013 a song that was once the fitting soundtrack to a car accident I had in the spring of \u201989 where everyone went to the hospital except yours truly), a string-of-chords instrumental that marches in place a minute too long (\u201cCodex Gigas\u201d), and another wordless ditty (Mike Wead-penned \u201cBlack Candles\u201d) that trickles the record\u2019s end. They\u2019ve got a countertenor like no other and we get a bevy of instrumentals trapped in a cul-de-sac. Yeah I know, Lindh, Johansson, Bjorkman, and Edling are a united force for sore ears, but here Messiah is like a new toy on Christmas, and you know how that goes. \n\nAll I have to say is, so why not the astonishing \u201cBattlecry\u201d? Why couldn\u2019t this song, a mover and shaker that\u2019s inexplicably demo-entrenched until \u201901, kick off side two, drop the Chopin piece down to finale, and blow \u201cBlack Candles\u201d onto one of the following eps? Finally exhumed, Candlemass brush off the dirt that hides this most combative track, streaking with anti-doom except where a future riff from Ancient Dreams\u2019 \u201cA Cry From the Crypt\u201d lumbers through and a chorus that showcases the highest pitches in Messiah\u2019s public repertoire. Maybe it would\u2019ve blown the album\u2019s doom trance off-course, but I sincerely doubt it. \n\n\u201c\u2026sleep well my friend 'cause this tale's now to end, don't believe our world is as safe's we pretend\u2026\u201d\n\nThe magnetism of Nightfall has yet to subside. It\u2019s still cemented on the \u2018must have\u2019 lists of doom enthusiasts, and rightfully so. Still, many are unaware of the band\u2019s existence, and it\u2019s proven each time \u201cAt the Gallows End\u201d spins at the bar at top volume (hail the DJ) to a confused face or two. Even with my minor complaint, my Nightfall disc remains a heavily played one. With \u201cBattlecry\u201d, Nightfall probably would\u2019ve garnered around a 95. \n\nFun fact 98d.3: In \u201cThe Well of Souls\u201d, the verse \u2018twelve strokes to Candlemass, darkness descends\u2019 unwittingly sparked a playful, tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement from the guys in Dark Angel, who rebutted with \u2018as darkness descends I behold the Candlemass\u2019 in their song \u201cThe Promise of Agony\u201d from their Leave Scars lp. Nice.\n\nRing brother. \n\n\"...it's no fun to burn in hell's fire but I sure have enjoyed my life...\"\n",
        "\n(This review is based on the 2003 remaster)\n\nCandlemass\u2019 debut album is, really, quite amazing. It does feel a bit empty at times, almost lacking atmosphere, though overall this is a solid release which, in the end, is worth the listen.\n\nThe first thing I\u2019d like to point out is the drumming on this album. The snare drum, in particular, has a fine sound that really fits in well with the album. Listening to snare drums on some of my other favourite albums makes them sound inferior to the snare on Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. The drums, while not fast and intense (as is the style with doom metal), does have its moments where they shine and do just a little more than keep the beat.\n\nThe guitar and bass, unfortunately, sound a little thin on the album. The bass in particular is weak, and doesn\u2019t do much for the music overall, which is a shame. On top of that, it is hardly heard, so that\u2019s another disappointment. It is the lack of bass that really fails to create an outstanding atmosphere.\n\nFocusing on the guitar now: the sound is great and the riffs are well-structured, however with the lack of bass and nonchalant drums for the most part, it is really the guitar that both holds the album together and makes it feel disappointingly\u2026 hollow, because that\u2019s all there really seems to be in the album. Criticism aside, it is the tuning of the guitar and its fantastic sound which is what makes this album special.\n\nThe vocals are something you\u2019ll either love or hate. Personally I find them to be outstanding, and they are very clean (something I enjoy a lot about this album), though for others it\u2019s enough to turn them off the music. To quote a friend who didn\u2019t like the vocals: \u201cI feel embarrassed for the singer\u201d. He says it sounds like the singer is trying too hard.\n\nOn to the songs \u2013 most of them are outstanding. The keyboards sound eerie on the tracks (and should probably be used more often), and there are a few lengthy songs which are probably the highlight of the album. The riffs are outstanding, the singing not too loud or soft, and the drums fairly consistent. Highlight tracks include \u201cDemon\u2019s gate\u201d and \u201cA sorcerer\u2019s pledge\u201d. And personally, I don\u2019t find \u201cSolitude\u201d to be an outstanding doom song as many find it to be, though I guess it is just a matter of opinion.\n\nIn summary, Candlemass got it right with the guitar. They got the drum\u2019s sound right, though didn\u2019t use it wisely enough. And the bass is just disappointing. However, the bass is heard, and that is really the thing that matters most.\n\nA highly recommended doom purchase, if you can overlook the small imperfections.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s be serious here, folks \u2013 by 1992 Candlemass, with the defection of two tremendously talented singers, had changed drastically. Sure, Leif was still there as he\u2019s always been, but this was a different Candlemass. In strictly \u201cCandlemass terms\u201d Chapter VI is a strange disappointment. However, if you forget about what Candlemass is supposed to sound like you\u2019ll find an all-too-neglected little slice of solid power doom.\n\nBrought in for the unenviable job of following a legend was Mr. Thomas Vikstrom, a rather unknown back then. As it turns out, Vikstrom has a great voice and is technically rock-solid. The only problem is, the man is much more geared towards power metal than doom (check out his great work on the latest Stowmwind disc), something Leif apparently understood since some of the material on Chapter VI leans heavily toward the power side of \u201cpower doom\u201d. Regardless, Vikstrom will always be known as the guy who replaced Messiah for one album, and he actually did a damn fine job.\n\nI\u2019ll skip a track-by-track analysis since ErikG already has that covered below, but I do have to mention a couple of numbers. The second track, titled \u201cJulie Laughs No More\u201d, is the best example of the \u201cnot Candlemass\u201d material. Speed it up a bit more and you\u2019d have something that could slide right into a Stratovarius album. Again, not traditional Candlemass, but it\u2019s still a good song. The real winner, though, is \u201cWhere the Runes Still Speak\u201d. Seriously, this thing just crushes everything in its path like an out-of-control cement truck. Easily a candidate for the best thing Candlemass ever recorded, the song contains a mindblowing performance from Vikstrom. Even if you\u2019ve heard some of the other songs on here and hated them, give this one a try. It\u2019s that good, just about worth the price of the CD by itself.\n\nOtherwise things are ship-shape, really. Production\u2019s in line with their past works, and Edling still has it in terms of writing and riff playing. The bass and drums are about as expected, meaning solid but unspectacular. Candlemass have quite a history, and their post-1989 stuff often times is wholly dismissed as not being worthy of the band\u2019s name. That may be so for some of the later albums, but give Chapter VI a try before forgetting it. It\u2019s not Nightfall by any stretch, but for what it is \u2013 that being old Candlemass fused with some power metal \u2013 it\u2019s very good.\n",
        "\nCandlemass second release called \"Nightfall\" is one of their best albums ever! 4 of the 10 songs on this album is short intros/interludes who sounds very cool if you're listening to the whole album at once. It starts off with \"Gothic Stone\" which is a short intro that leads us right on to \"The Well Of Souls\". This is a epic song with excellent lyrics and outstanding vocalperformance by Messiah Marcolin. I will just concentrate on the \"real\" songs and goes directly to \"At The Gallows End\" who has a acoustic intro with some solo-leads from Johansson, the first verse is slow and beautiful and the song raises tempo with a heavy and pretty fast (for being Candlemass) riff. Great chorus and great lyrics.\n\nNext is the best song on the album called \"Samarithan\" , the song is slow and heavy with cool verses and a very beautiful chorus. Tempochange during the excellent solo and then the verse again and the chorus again with different lyrics, needless to say - the lyrics on this album is among the best ever written! Side two starts with \"Marche Funebre\", it's a pretty good choir intro with guitarleads. And then comes \"Dark Are The Veils Of Death\". The song starts with a drum intro and then comes the Sabbath-like riff, reminds about something from Vol 4. Then another riff that leads on to the fast verses with the double bass drum, awesome!\n\nNext song is \"Mourners Lament\", another slow song with great vocals and lyrics about the loss of your child. The chorus is backed up by great drumming by Lindh. \n\n\"Bewitched\" is next, this song is not bad, not at all, but it just does'nt appeal to me as the others do. Although it has some good heavy riffs, good lyrics and a long brilliant solo. Finally the album ends with a, i have to say, great outro called \"Black Candles\". \n\nThis album is just really kickass, if you're into to doom metal and never heard this, but then you probably have, but anyway... do yourself a favour and pick it up!\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026I saw the rainbow\u2019s end. I am raptured I cannot pretend. I have found Atlantis\u2026\u201d\n\nThere\u2019re very few bands that can do something as oxymoronic as invigorate doom metal. Celtic Frost does its portions with orchestral ambiance and lyrical genius. My Dying Bride and Celestial Season employ(ed) the moaning, dispiriting atmosphere of both/either electric or conventional violin. Trouble has the Christian angle. Candlemass, unlike those rightfully masterful bands, exploit no instrument originally alien to the metal realm and forgo 99.9% of all religious ideology. No tricks or gadgets. Like Breyer's ice cream, they do it with all natural ingredients: mesmerizing rhythms, grandiose structures, obscurely downtrodden vocals awakening words of story-form fantasy and abjection, and an aura\u2026a mood that advances with the flow and weight of hardening magma. \n\nOf course, the band\u2019s history isn\u2019t all one stage, but three made up of the pre and post Messiah Marcolin periods. Epicus\u2026 and the scarce Nemesis ep are the pre-era, a fickle and insecure time when the variable-member band had found its sound, yet were a few shades away from perfecting it. With Nemesis a few years under the bridge, Epicus\u2026, despite its rawness, revolving door membership and gust of session musicians performing chores, is an epic, awe-inspiring shard of metal history whose place and importance can be refuted by few, and most of this hall of fame fortune is owed to mainman Leif Edling. Metal isn\u2019t chock full of full-fledged brainchildren, a person who walks with a vision and works it to glaring fruition, and on a fair list of ten or so, this Swedish bassist/lyricist rubs shoulders with anyone from Tom Warrior to Jon Zazula to Chuck Schuldiner (RIP). \n\n\u201c\u2026scared I was with my hand on my cross, I went into the demons gate\u2026\u201d\n\nFor these six near-masterpieces of doom, Edling surrenders much of his vocal duties to session singer Johan Lanquist, a man whose uncomplicated and grievous style resembles that of the bassist\u2019s but is a bit more pronounced with tighter control over his chords. No despair is lost, and at the start of the cumbersome \u201cSolitude\u201d the pair give the listener a forlorn duet that is an aural portrait to their similarity of style. An ode Edling wrote to himself, \u201cSolitude\u201d hides nothing, banishing all cheer to the local county fair and with a chorus like a funeral chant dwindles hope into grains of sand. Solos weep a similar path with the rhythm thanks to session stringer Klas Bergwall. \u201cDemon\u2019s Gate\u201d with its epic length, grisly narration, and eruptions of twin bass-punished rhythms, is considered a Candlemass icon by many, and I\u2019m not about to dispute that. \u201cCrystal Ball\u201d possesses an opening riff that flows with a maligned elegance, embellishing the lofty lyrics, yet stands opposite its chunky main tempo that stints with more pummeling double bass. \n\n\u201d\u2026where is the morning? Where is the sun? A thousand years of midnight, the sunrise is gone\u2026\u201d\n\nSide two finds another epic in \u201cBlack Stone Wielder\u201d, a swelling tale of the ancestral passing of misused power that is told not only through words, but also through emotive movements of music that lie in the perpetual tread of the pace, the dynamic chorus, and then when the summation (starting with \u201c\u2026black stone wielder is born\u2026\u201d) of the story vitalizes the gait for a compelling finish. The eldest warhorse in the lp\u2019s stable, \u201cUnder the Oak\u201d, is another tale of anguish with not only some of the most somber of the album\u2019s moments, but some of the most vehement, gripping notes in Lanquist\u2019s repertoire. \u201cA Sorcerer\u2019s Pledge\u201d, the third titan of the bunch, is introduced acoustically, almost ballad-like with Lanquist\u2019s distressful recount of a wizard\u2019s foolishly ambitious plan the main focus thus far. This transforms into a handful of earnest rhythms that keep the story\u2019s tempo dramatic, and the most striking one for me is the one bridging the verses. A short impromptu keyboard interlude readies a finale that tapers exquisitely into a choir of angels. \n\n\u201c\u2026 and nothing remains of this foolish man except his fate\u2026\u201d\n\nIn addition to the vocals and solos, Mats Bjoerkman mans the rhythm guitar while stick-slammer Matz Ekstroem takes the seat of Anders Waltersson. But he who remains is the master. The master of the hunt for the perfect doom resonance that will come with omnipotent Nightfall. Comparing Epicus\u2026 with the following year\u2019s endeavor is like comparing a groundhog to a muskrat. They look and sound very much alike until the muskrat starts doing the backstroke and the groundhog looks on in horror, and then the distinction becomes clear. In as many words, that is the impact one portly, monk-attired and frizzy-haired vocalist had on Candlemass\u2019 future sound. \n\nEngineered and co-produced by Ragne Walhquist of Heavy Load.\n\n\u201c\u2026earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\n2005 is really shaping up to be a promising year for the Doom Metal genre. It seems that numerous Doom Metal bands are making a coincidental yet seemingly unified presence that just might over shadow the saturated genres of metal markets such as Power Metal, Death Metal and Black Metal. With releases from Draconia, Swallow The Sun, November's Doom, soon to be releases from Trouble and a Black Sabbath reunion tour, we now find Candlemass adding something to the mix.....\n\nBack in 2003, I reviewed Candlemass' \"Doomed For Live-Reunion 2002\". This release was just one step in a process that would lead to something I had hoped for back when I wrote the review......a new studio album!\n\n\"Candlemass\" is the band's first release through Nuclear Blast and first studio album with Messiah Marcolin back on vocals since \"Tales of Creation\" in 1990. \"Candlemass\" was recorded in part at Polar studios (ABBA, GENESIS, LED ZEPPELIN) in Stockholm, Sweden. \n\nWell Candlemass fans, the new release is their best effort since \"Tales of Creation\". This album does a fine job of mixing slower pounding, more doomy styled songs with some mid-tempo ones. You'll find classic tinges of Candlemass all throughout the album, as well as a few surprises. In many ways, this album gives the listener the feeling of such Candlemass classics as \"Nightfall\" and \"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus\".\n\nThe production is very good. The recording and mix between the drums and the bass provide an excellent, low range response that gives the songs some much needed bottom end. something that seemed to be missing on previous Candlemass albums. The trademark Sabbathy guitar riffs are as heavy and catchier than ever. Some keys are used but they are very low in the mix and seem to be there to add some atmosphere and highlights. And what would a Candlemass album be without the vocals of Messiah Marcolin, the one ingredient that really gives this band an identity and whose voice is much more dynamic now when compared to his work in the past.. He uses the full range of his vocals and doesn't over use is throttle capabilities. He sings with as much power and clarity today as he did back in the late 80's, early 90's. He also adds some interesting vocal styles unlike he has on previous Candlemass albums. He goes from very low ranges to his more familiar higher octaves. Such an example of a song in which these characteristics are noticeable on is \"Copernicus\".\n\n\"Black Dwarf\" is one of the more up tempo songs that reminds me of a track like \"Gallow's End\". And the riffs in \"Witches\" are reminiscent of \"Black Stone Wielder\". \"Born In A Tank\" brings back feelings of \"A Cry From The Crypt\". \"The Man Who Fell from the Sky\" is an instrumental.\n\nThis album is a must have. I already have four to six albums that are potentials for my 2005 Top 15 and this one is no exception. Candlemass is back and in a big way! Let the Doom Dancing begin!\n",
        "\nThis is my first review so I'll try to do a damn good job. If you cant tell, I'm a huge Candlemass fan and this is been something I've been looking forward to for a while. It has been 16 years since there has been a studio album with vocalist extra-ordinare Messiah Marcolin. Would it be as good as other Candlemass albums or a sad reunion album?\n\nBlack Dwarf: My cd has the intro and this song put together. I was floored when I heard this song for the first time. It seems like Messiah and Co. havent been separated for 16 years. Some excellent guitar work from Johansson and Bjorkman on this track.\n\nSeven Silver Keys: This sorta seems like something off Epicus Doomicus Metalicus; the whole fantasy lyric deal. Not that there is anything wrong with that. This song is a killer. It has a really slow and plodding feeling to it, another Candlemassaterpeace.\n\nAssassin of the Light: The opening riff has a really evil, eerie feeling to it and I love it. The song kinda reminds me of Trouble for some reason, maybe just the title. Marcolin manages to continue to belt it out as in days of old. I still cant believe these guys havent achieved international superstardom. \n\nCopernicus: Named after the famed astronomer, Copernicus has a nice beginning. A really slow and plodding riff and then dead silence. Then Messiah begins to sing in a haunting way and then that riff picks up like it never ended. This song kinda reminds me of \"Black Sabbath\" with the whole heavy, dreary riff and then the vocals come, except I think Messiah Marcolin sounds a whole hell of a lot better than Ozzy Osbourne. Another great track.\n\nThe Man Who Fell From the Sky: eh, the only reason I gave this album a 95 is because of this track. It's an instrumental, but it is nowhere near as good as \"Into The Unfathomed Tower,\" the ultimate Candlemass instrumental. TMWFFS kinda bores me.\n\nWitches: The actual first song I heard off the album. A friend of mine had this and sent it to me, thus prompting me to get a hold of this album. I love the riff, Messiah's singing, etc. My second favorite song on the album. Contains one of my favorite lyrics \"leave this fucking place!\" Really outta place, but come on its Candlemass!\n\nBorn In A Tank: Imagine if Saint Vitus and Alice in Chains had a child and wrote a song. This is what it would sound like. The lyrics are very strong as is the chugging riff, which make this song my favorite. This would make an interesting music video because of the visuals the song gives me.\n\nSpellbreaker: this is why Candlemass is associated with epic doom metal. Another great track, going 7 minutes and 2 seconds with plenty of tempo shifts. The solo is quite nice and the fade out at the end is a nice touch.\n\nThe Day and the Night: Has a dark, blusey feeling at first which I like and more Messiah singing along with it. From there it picks up with his legendary opera crooning and the tourtise-paced riffs. Around 3:55, the song begins to pick up and by 4:15 it gets heavy. What a fucking way to end an album. Almost as good as A Sorcerer's Pledge. \"I'm lost in the dark...\" priceless\n\nMars and Volcanos (digipack bonus): A nice little bonus for Candlemass fans. This is a more quick pased song than I'm used to from them, but a great change nonetheless. The last 45 seconds is a nice little display of Jahn Lindt's drum work.\n\nWhat can I say? Candlemass still has it. The first studio album with Messiah Marcolin in 16 years is a damn fine one. Other than the so/so instrumental, this is a great piece of doom metal. One of my favorite albums of the year and it is a great way to showcase how talented Candlemass is. In a day and age where all this metalcore bullshit seems to be taking over, I'm glad to see guys like Candlemass sticking to their guns and showing how much more talented they are. A 95 out of 100 for Messiah and Company.\n",
        "\nCandlemass without Messiah Marcolin? Can such a thing even exist? It can, and it is proven in this monster of an album. Candlemass truly delivers with this much more modern sounding doom metal style. As much as we would all like our beloved bands to keep on churning out the same exact album with the same exact sound over And over, it simply cannot happen. Candlemass departs from the epic sounding tones of their majestic first four albums and simply sounds over all inspired with this release. It could be said that this is not only one of Candlemass\u2019s greatest albums, but truly at the peak of the whole metal movement.\n\nThe album opens with \u201cDroid\u201d, as soon as it starts you know that only a band as amazing as Candlemass could have such a killer melody and guitar and bass tone. The vocals are not opera style, so for all of you that bitch about Messiah's vocals, you will have to check this guy out, he fits the band perfectly. Next comes \u201cTot\u201d a somber song, the rain and church bells at the beginning set the atmosphere, this song could be called a semi-ballad, melancholic lyrics pour out of the speakers, but then like thunder monstrous guitar riff and church bell brake the silence.\n\nNext comes the fast paced \u201cElephant Star\u201d one of the heaviest tracks, you can immediately hear the Black Sabbath influence, a great rocker. \u201cBlumma Apt\u201d is has a very groovy guitar riff that exclaims, \u201cGet a bong and smoke me!\u201d I mean is this a stoner\u2019s song or what? If there is any low point in the album I would say it is \u201cArx/NG 891\u201d It starts like a Hawkwind song(Hawkwind rules by the way), like flying saucers or something in outer space, really trippy, but not up to par with the other songs.\n\nThe album picks right up with \u201cZog\u201d, this is a crusher, slow, dense, and those damn catchy riffs that Candlemass do so well, throughout the song there is a weird distortion like guitar, it adds a third dimension to the song, amazing stuff. Then comes the best track of the album in my opinion, \u201cGalatea\u201d is the gem of this treasure. A brilliant combination of haunting lyrics \u201cIn the grass the ogre is slayed\u2026fragile moment of the day\u201d, and an overall melancholy that creeps under your skin and stays with you for hours, I would say that this is one of Candlemass\u2019s best songs ever.\n\nThe album closes with \u201cCyclo \u2013 f\u201d and \u201cMythos\u201d. Both are odd tracks, \u201cCyclo \u2013 F\u201d is a great doom song, with a long ass drum solo in the middle, again it picks up the pace so the album ends on a crushing note. \u201cMythos\u201d is like an outro, creepy if you ask me. This album is a masterpiece. From just hearing, the first couple of songs you understand that what you are listening to is out of the ordinary and that you are in the presence of greatness. It amazes me that this album gets so little recognition from the metal hordes across the world, it is simply brilliant and worth every cent of your hard earned money. Of course it dose not surprise me that this album comes from Candlemass, they are truly the masters of what they do.\n",
        "\nCandlemass are so tight on this concert, I almost prefer to listen to this album than any of their studio albums. Messiah Marcolin displays his enormous vocal powers again and again, giving a near (see the next paragraph) perfect performance that at times gives me goosebumps. His operatic wailing combined with the enormous weight of the riffs leaves no doubt in ones mind that not only are Candlemass the greatest doom metal band that has ever existed, they are also one of the better bands I've ever heard (and seen, actually) live.\nThey don't just play some great songs flawlessly, the enhance the music for the occasion so it will be even better to experience live. For example, when they play At The Gallows End they slow it down in the beginning and then when the chorus starts they speed it up to create the illusion that the song rocks more than it usually does (since the studio recording rocks beyond anything that has ever rocked before, it has to be an illusion).\nSolitude performed by Messiah and the bands post-Nightfall sound is great to experience as well. Johan Lanquist from Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is a decent vocalist but he definitely is not of the same caliber as the Messiah.\n\nEven though I pretty much kiss Marcolins feet in this review, one of the slight shortcomings of the album lies on his shoulders. I get the feeling that he doesn't give everything he has to offer at times and just drones out parts of the songs (which could be because of the somewhat cool reception I sense from the audience), which is a shame and lowers the overall score of the album. \n\nThe tracklist of the album is a pretty safe selection of great songs that are widely and generally accepted as their greatest tunes. Which is good, but I'd still liked to have heard some of the less known songs that I personally appreciate more than the ones that are the most popular. But I realize that it is an unealistic thing to wish for, since they obviously want to please the crowd in general and not just me.\n\nAll in all, this is a great live performance that I would have loved to see personally.\n",
        "\nIt's hard to believe that this EP is actually by Candlemass. I was seriously doubting the authenticity of my mp3s untill I checked the songtitles listed online with the lyrics sung. The reason for my doubtfullness is that this EP sounds nothing at all like the Candlemass I knew from either the Leif Edling demo collection or the 'From The 13th Sun' album. Doomy lyrics/vocals or riffs/guitars? Nope; this more like funpunk, like say the Toydolls. I don't understand that much Swedish, but I understand the music shouldn't be taken too seriously. This is probably meants as music to dance drunkenly to the wacky carnavalesque melodies to, while singing along to the inane chorusses.\n\nI'll give this a 70%. It's neither classic Candlemass nor timeless material, but it's not bad either. Not necessarily for the die-hard Candlemass collectors; it's just wacky fun (probably more if you do Swede-speak). Just be warned that this album doesn't even come close to doom metal.\n",
        "\nDoom legend, Candlemass' fourth album and third with legendary vocalist Messiah Marcolin. This album continues in the same style as the past three albums with Messiah Marcolin singing That style being the \u201cepic doom metal\u201d style. This album is every bit as great as the previous albums and I still hold it to be above Ancient Dreams or Nightfall. The album is just that perfect.\n\nTales of Creation begins with a short intro with spoken words and with a good riff played behind it. The first full song is \u201cDark Reflections\u201d which like all the band's songs has a great riff and is played perfectly. This song mixes into a short 15 second spoken segment which mixes into \u201cUnder the Oak\u201d which has a really heavy and great riff. The song progresses nicely as well. \u201cTears\u201d follows up next and doesn't fail to disappoint. \u201cInto the unfathomed Tower\u201d is a weird and fast paced instrumental, it of course is damn good and won't disappoint. \u201cThe Edge of Heaven\u201d Follows it and is yet another great track with a great riff, great vocals and style. \u201cSomewhere in Nowhere\u201d is a very doomy song, slow riff and more lower vocals then normal. \u201cThrough the Infinitive Halls of Death\u201d speeds the pace up a bit and features some great riffs, solos and vocals. Definitely one of the stand out tracks (all of them are though) This song is followed by the last of the spoken tracks \u201cDawn\u201d which follows into the last song on the album, \u201cA Tale of Creation\u201d which I think has one of the coolest riffs they ever made. The song is of course amazing like the rest of the album. Very worthy of anyones time. \n\nThe albums production also gains a great amount of praise. The guitar is mixed very powerful, very heavy and audible. The vocals are givin the power they need in the mix. The drumming is very good during the album and aren't mixed too loud. The bass you can barely hear but the album certainly doesn't lack the bass end of sound. \n\nThis album is a definite classic and although I don't think it can match up to the groups debut \u201cEpicus Doomicus Metallicus\u201d, it is still a very essential and classic release. Go get this album and their others right now, anyone who likes doom or claims so should own a copy of all the Candlemass releases anyways.\n",
        "\nFor people into metal, it\u2019s normal for certain bands to pop into your head when you hear the \u201cDoom Metal.\u201d The first band is usually Black Sabbath, and for the sake of this review, I hope the second band that jumps into your head is Candlemass.\n\nFor those (unfortunate) few not familiar with Candlemass, they are a five piece band from Sweden characterized by their thick sludgy epic sound and their insane borderline operatic vocalist. \n\nSome people would say that Candlemass founded their very own genre within a genre, most often referred to as \u201cEpic Power Doom.\u201d Their third full length release, titled Ancient Dreams found them moving further into this genre by establishing more of a stronghold within the doom community. \n\nNot as impressive as their previous album Nightfall, this is still a very strong album\nmost fans of doom probably aren\u2019t as familiar with Ancient Dreams as they might be with Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, their first full length released in 1986.\n\nAll of the elements that fans of doom have come to expect from Candlemass are of course present in this 1988 release. You have the slow crawling to mid-paced tempo, the sweeping arcs of melody laden riffs arranged beautifully to create a very epic appeal to the presentation of the album and a man with the voice needed to get the powerful words and emotions across.\n\nMessiah Marcolin is the name belonging to the voice on this album. With a unique timbre and style of singing, Messiah\u2019s vocal power rivals that of an opera singer. With his incredible range and strong vibrato, he is the epitome of what most power metal vocalists strive to be. While annoying to some, I find that his voice adds something to this album that would be lacking with any other vocalist. \u201cEpistle No. 81\u201d is a perfect example of how versatile his voice really is. The music in this song is what you would expect from Candlemass: dark and somber with excellent deep-pitched vocals in the appropriate places.\n\nEven though this album is pure doom, it excels in variety. Not only do they play in slow motion, most songs are peppered with faster passages as well, and there are also gothic melodic passages as well, if only to keep the listener\u2019s attention, which is fine. Not that they need to do that here. If the music isn\u2019t enough to keep your attention, bassist and chief songwriter Leif Edling has added lyrics that definitely capture the imagination and ears of those listening. The stories of demons, death, darkness and despair should appeal to all fans of the band.\n\nLead guitarist Lars Johansson is a wonderful soloist and he isn\u2019t afraid to use a variety of techniques in his playing. You get a combination of sludgy slow Sabbath-type riffs and dark melodies delivered with less low end and more beautiful haunting melodies than one might expect from a band in this genre.\n\nTo demonstrate the wide variety on this album, you should listen to \u201cMirror Mirror\u201d and \u201cBearer of Pain\u201d which are two of the thrashier songs on this album while songs like \u201cIncarnation of Evil\u201d is more slow and plodding.\n\nAncient Dreams is an album highlighted by memorable choruses, dark melodies and epic compositions all in the seven minute range. While most fans of Candlemass would rate this below Nightfall and Epicus, I have to rate this higher than both. I feel that the vocal arrangements on this album are far more emotional than the two albums before it. This is definitely essential \u201880s metal, especially for those with a soft spot for bands like Solitude Aeturnus and later My Dying Bride.\n\nAlso, as an added bonus, there is a wonderful Black Sabbath medley. A little something for everyone, I guess.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely a masterpiece of doom. If you\u2019re into doom at all, you\u2019ll be into this album.\n",
        "\nI've heard a lot of metal in my day, and a fair chunk of that has been Doom Metal. And out of all the doom bands that I've heard, a large chunk has been really shitty. Don't ask me why, but Doom Metal is one of those genres that seems to attract a lot of really shitty bands. It's not as bad as Black Metal (you wouldn't believe how many turd black bands are out there), but it's enough to give one a jaded impression of the genre. It's not that I don't like Doom Metal--I do. It's just that there is a real art to playing Doom Metal, and many bands miss the nuances that make the music really good.\n\nNot Candlemass. They've got it right. The band has the solid combination of absolutely killer riffs and great vocals, and it all comes out on Nightfall. Everything is solid, and while it's not extraordinary, it's really worth the time to enjoy.\n\nThe riffage is supremely powerful here. The Well of Souls immediately nails you to the wall with a steady onslaught of riffs over a slow, steady drumbeat. It has a very morbid sound, and yet Codex Gigas, the next song, has some positively evil riffage. This ability to manipulate sounds to create different impressions upon the listener is one of the aformentioned Doom Metal Nuances that Candlemass has down cold. Other songs with noticeably cool riffage include At the Gallows End, Dark are the Veils of Death and the absolutely haunting Black Candles.\n\nCandlemass's other strong point is its vocalist, who has a really great sound. He sings with clean vocals (as opposed to the undead-sounding harsh vocals of the doom variety), but that's not why they're strong--the fact is that his vocals are dark and brooding and really create the impression that if you tickle him he will not laugh. The two vocal styles you can pick up here are displayed in two seperate songs: Well of Souls, which has his darker, brooding sound, and At the Gallows End, which has the more midpaced, yet still quite doom-ish vocal style.\n\nBottom line here is that this is good Doom Metal, and that's not something you see every day. Doom fans would do well to pick up a copy of this, and those attempting to get more into the scene might enjoy this album, as the clean vocals are easier to get adjusted to than the harsh doom vocals of, say, Galadriel.\n",
        "\nI didn't think I'd dig on Candlemass much... from my earlier experience (mp3s) they were all doom'n'gloom. Nightfall contains plenty of said doom'n'gloom, but enough solid metal riffs to get any head bangin'. Seriously a great disc, and, along with Trouble, these guys are the archetype for doom.\n\nOpening track Well of Souls is just fucking killer... a mid paced thrash riff interpersed with moans of lament and sludge. Check out the Haunted's cover for some more metalness. There aren't any abysmal tunings, and the guitars focus more on single note riffs rather than chordage. Singer Messiah Marcolin (the ugliest fucker on the planet) has a great voice and the production is very pleasant... for it's 1987 release date this is pure gold. \n\nMy favorite song has to be To the Gallows End... well placed acoustic guitar alongside badass riff = \\m/. These guys obviously aren't big fans of clowns or dance music... \"doom\" metal is an honestly. appropriate term since everything is played at a dirge, and death seems to be their preoccupation. Somebody get them a hug and a trip to disney world.\n",
        "\nDactylis Glomerata was Candlemass' comeback album after Leif Edling decided to break the band up after Chapter VI. Before Chapter VI was released, Candlemass's long-time vocalist, Messiah Marcolin, had left the band and Chapter VI was a very different kind of album from it's predeccors and, as almost always when band's music style changes, not as popular as their old albums. What attracted me to this album was the fact that the guitar spot on this album is handled by one Michael Amott. \n\nAs I said, Dactylis Glomerata isn't that much doom metal as the band's previous works. Sadly so, since Candlemass made some of the greatest doom metal albums back in the day. Most of the epic feeling is lost too. But there are other things making up for the lost things. For example the starting song 'Wiz' rocks more than most of the songs Candlemass did before (rocks as in being rocky, not as in being better than something else). It is also very catchy with a Black Sabbathesque main riff. The next song, 'I Still see the Black', leans more in the classic doomish Candlemass style as does 'Dustflow'. 'Karthago' combines a Black Sabbathish riff with a doom metal song and 'Abstrakt Sun' has a doomish feeling but mostly it sounds more like a rock song than metal. 'Apathy' is a moody 'Planet Caravan' meets 'Electric Funeral' and 'Ludocain God' is one again a rocking, a bit thrasy even, song in the vein of 'Wiz'. What I'm trying to say here is that the album is varied, a bit patchy even, but Leif Edling has managed to keep it all together.\n\nThough most old Candlemass fans don't find the album good, it is still worth a shot. The material ranges from good to great (seems like Edling can't even compose anything poor) and it features some great guitaring by Michael Amott (don't expect anything like Arch Enemy or Carcass, more like Spiritual Beggars) and some interesting use of the keyboards by Carl Westholm. Mostly he stays in the background, proving some atmosphere adding effects while other times coming into the front with a scifi soundind lead (beginning of 'Dustflow'). Bj\u00f6rn Fl\u00f6dkvist is a good singer too. He's no Messiah Marcolin when it comes to operatic vocals but he provides some good traditional vocalizing and he does have a lot of emotion in his voice.\n\nThe main reason why Dactylis Glomerata sounds so different from other Candlemass albums is that some of the songs were supposed to appear on the second Abstrakt Algebra (Edling's other band) album but MFN weren't going to sign them, though they were willing to sign Candlemass. So Edling hastily founded Candlemass again and took the drummer of Abstrakt Algebra with him. Surprisingly though Dactylis Glomerata doesn't sound like Abstrakt Algebra's self titled album. I still recommend to all fans of Black Sabbath and doom metal but if you want to check out Candlemass, I suggest either Nightfall or Epicus Doomicus Metallicus over this one.\n"
