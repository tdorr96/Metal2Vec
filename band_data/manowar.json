        "\nOh, how mighty have fallen! The legendary USPM band has officially hit the new low, completely ignoring their fans' outrage they've faced when releasing \"The Final Battle I\". After three years of blissful silence, Joey decided it's a high time to violate their legacy even further, by preparing another album, from which the highlights were taken - or rather from a single track of the upcoming release - The Revenge of Odysseus. Some may have thought that Manowar has learnt on the mistakes made on \"The Lord of Steel\", but we couldn't be more mistaken.\n\nComparing current Manowar with the \"Battle Hymns\" era Manowar would've been cruel and completely unfair, given the age factor, so let's focus on the \"Gods of War\" - \"Thunder in the Sky\" era. No more than 14 years ago, they were capable of releasing some good material interrupted by narratives. It wasn't the prime stuff from before the 90s, but it was still Manowar at heart - and that's what mattered. Then, a switch was flipped in Joey's mind (as he had the complete control over the compositions) and they've released the complete mess \"The Lord of Steel\" was. Since that time, we've been through two editions of this mishap and \"The Final Battle I\", which was an another flop. \n\nNow, I welcome you to 2022 Manowar. All hopes of redemption or originality begone! If you felt the change in the wind, I'll have to disappoint you. We are presented with \"Highlights from the Revenge of Odysseus\", comprised of 5 tracks (or rather snippets) cut out from the grandiose song by the same name, which serves as the second part of the piece, right after \"Achilles's Agony and Ecstasy\". After a fairly mediocre intro called \"Athena's Theme\", we're greeted by a narrative in ancient Greek, accompanied by thick ambience of storm, various birds and brass parts. I understood nothing, but thought of one certainty: Manowar is becoming a story-telling band. A group that would help you push through an audiobook of some epic work. But then, that's not really the point to release new stuff under \"Manowar\", is it?\n\nI feel like I derailed this review enough, as did the band derail its creative work. Let's focus on the two only parts of the song that are musical enough. First one being \"Where Eagles Fly\", which is a ballad that sounds very similar to \"Courage\". It fails to deliver any kind of \"power\" part of the stylistic, nor does it put a spotlight on Eric's voice. It just drags on and suddenly you're finished with it, but despite its flaws, it's the most unique track of all from their discography, as it features a guest vocalist. Chiara Tricarico adds a little to the dimension of this track, but doesn't save it from its demise. \n\nAnd now, time for the \"Immortal\" - the only pure metal track on this record. The first thing that stroke me dead on the spot was the usage of programmed drums. Programmed drums, which they didn't even try to hide - programmed drums so obvious, that the snare samples are choking each other out. And they want us to pay for it. I'd expect that from a bedroom producer who started to work on his first or second track, not from a band that lasted 42 years in the business! You might say that it's just for the \"highlight\" - well then, if you plan to show us something, hype us up or convince us that it's worthy of our time, hire the damned drummer! Not to mention, that the drum groove is childishly simple, as it was on \"Warriors of the World United\", so it was as effortless as letting an angsty teenager from a local metalcore band behind the drumkit for one session. The guitars are drowned out, uninspired and weirdly panned - there's no edge to them, no matter how far and wide you look - those will keep sounding like cheap Fisher Price toys. The power chords are moved from left to right for whatever reason, lacking double-tracking, like in an amateurish punk-rock band demo. Eric's scream accompanying this mess sounds just as pathetic, but in his case - it's time for a well earned rest. \n\nFrom the good side - the bass sounds way better than on \"The Lord of Steel\" and that's pretty much it. The mix is on the right volume, at least.\n\nLet's face it - anyone who has any kind of respect for this band's legacy will avoid this \"record\". The only ones remaining will be the fanatics of the \"brand\", not the band, for whom it will be yet another peak in their discography. It all seems like Joey targeted his most fierce zealots with this crap, knowing that they'll chug it without complaining. This shouldn't exist. This should've never been released in that state to begin with. It is a spit in the face for Manowar fans, Manowar's legacy and to anyone who has working eardrums. Maybe it's just time to admit to your mistakes and make things up with Ross to come up with something sensible? \n\nIf you like this kind of theme - Odysseys and such - avoid this at all costs. You will get disappointed and depressed. Proceed to Symphony X's \"The Odyssey\" and let Manowar become its own parody band.\n",
        "\nFor years, Manowar\u2019s excessive use of heavy metal stereotypes has been the punchline of so many jokes that it\u2019s easy to forget how pretty damn good they once were; so many jokes, in fact, that making fun of the band\u2019s reliance on clich\u00e9s has almost become clich\u00e9d in itself, if that makes any sense. Even so, the truth is that Joey and the boys\u2014we\u2019re mostly talking about mastermind Joey DeMaio here as Manowar, ever since parting ways with original guitarist Ross the Boss, have mainly consisted of Joey, long-time singer Eric Adams and a bunch of hired guns\u2014have brought most of the jokes on themselves, what with the infamous loincloths and formulaic lyrics using the words metal, glory, honor, steel and/or blood in seemingly every other line.\n\nOn stage, the band apparently still kicks ass to this day, Joey\u2019s stage antics and insistence on treating the audience to endless self-indulgent bass solos notwithstanding. But the fact that the band\u2019s albums have been subpar or worse ever since Warriors of the World, which was kind of a mixed bag itself, has certainly put a rather sizeable dent in the band\u2019s reputation. While it would be quite amazing if Manowar managed to create one last truly great album on a similar level with the vaunted classics in their catalog, any hopes to that end are admittedly quite slim.\n\nThen again, we cannot fairly judge an older album by the more recent trajectory of a band\u2019s career; we have to ignore all that and look exclusively at what\u2019s being offered, and in Manowar\u2019s early days, they offered quite a lot. Along with other American bands such as Manilla Road or Cirith Ungol, they had an incredibly good thing going in the early 1980s, blazing the trail for what nowadays would be called epic metal, a term that was of course coined only much later. From today\u2019s perspective, Into Glory Ride is the first Manowar album fully deserving of that label. Their debut Battle Hymns featured the band\u2019s first forays into epic territory, namely the songs \u201cDark Avenger\u201d and \u201cBattle Hymn,\u201d but by and large it was still heavily influenced by 1970s hard rock. It was pretty good in its own right, but undeniably different from what Manowar were about to become. Into Glory Ride, then, was the album on which Manowar\u2019s artistic and musical vision fully took shape.\n\nFor that, look no further than track number two, \u201cSecret of Steel,\u201d which the band has played live numerous times over the years. It is almost like the blueprint of an epic metal song, as well as a worthy musical tribute to the \u201cbarbarian\u201d fantasy tales of authors such as Robert E. Howard, creator of the prolific Conan stories. It just has this heroic atmosphere, conjuring up images of immensely muscular dudes with long hair and huge swords fighting savage beasts or salvaging long-lost treasures. \u201cSecret of Steel\u201d features powerful riffs, a stoic beat and some of the most uplifting melodies this side of Cimmeria. If you had to pick just one track to perfectly capture the predominant mood and musical direction on Into Glory Ride, it would be this.\n\nTrue to form, there aren\u2019t many rhythm or tempo changes, as most of the tracks are content to just march along at a steady and unwavering pace. Epic metal has always been more about atmosphere than technicality, and even though there is some variation from one track to the next, the album as a whole has a very homogenous feel to it. Then again, when you have great guitar play from easily the best guitarist Manowar have ever had, you don\u2019t necessarily need to cram a dozen different riffs into your songs. Ross the Boss isn\u2019t one to wow you with his technical exploits, but his play had substance and style, an unmistakable identity none of his successors came anywhere close to replicating. His riffs have weight and his solos are both imaginative and memorable.\n\nAs far as individual performances go, Into Glory Ride showcases four musicians who are totally on the same page, each bringing his very own style\u2014Joey DeMaio is easily one the most instantly recognizable and inventive bass players ever\u2014and clearly defined strengths to the table. Speaking of strengths, what Eric Adams was able to deliver on the first couple of Manowar albums is almost not of this world. His voice is both insanely powerful and beautifully melodic, boasting incredible range and enabling him to deliver some of the most memorable vocal lines as well as some of the most amazing high-pitched screams. Speaking of the latter, he tends to overdo it a bit on \u201cHatred,\u201d which is another slow burner almost venturing into doom metal territory and sporting that peculiar middle section where Adams pushes his vocal acrobatics to the extreme. But what the hey\u2014when you have the keys to a Ferrari, it\u2019s no good letting it waste away in the garage.\n\nInto Glory Ride features only seven songs, the majority of which are between six and a half and eight and a half minutes long, reflecting the epic nature of the music. \u201cGloves of Metal,\u201d an anthemic crowd-pleaser with an ultra-catchy main riff and trademark self-referential \u201cglory of metal\u201d lyrics, and opener \u201cWarlord\u201d (the one with the somewhat infamous intro) are the two shortest and simplest cuts. The latter is more of a jaunty up-tempo rocker going back to the predominant style found on the debut album, making it a bit of an oddity in the context of the band\u2019s sophomore effort. Then again, it is a strong tune worthy of inclusion and it bears noting that stylistically comparable bands such as Manilla Road or Cirith Ungol used to have similar songs to, as it were, lighten the mood (think of, for instance, \u201cHeavy Metal to the World\u201d or \u201c100 m.p.h.\u201d).\n\n\u201cGates to Valhalla,\u201d one of Manowar\u2019s earliest renditions of Viking folklore and mythology, begins with a solemn intro and, once it gets going, flows along nicely, pushing forward at a brisk head-banging pace and flashing a healthy feel for the (melo-)dramatic. The album concludes on a similarly high note with two more warlike, sprawling tunes in the form of \u201cRevelation (Death\u2019s Angel)\u201d and \u201cMarch for Revenge (by the Soldiers of Death).\u201d Just like many of the great metal classics, Into Glory Ride finishes strong, saving some of the best material for last.\n\nIf Into Glory Ride has one undeniable weakness, it\u2019s in the production department, where it unfortunately shows its age\u2014as well as the supposedly tight budget the band worked on back in the day. The rhythm guitars in particular tend to sound rather thin in places, which is most obvious on \u201cGloves of Metal,\u201d and the bass could use a little more low-end rumble. Luckily, there is a remedy for this: the album\u2019s not just remastered but remixed\u2014though fortunately not re-recorded!\u2014re-release from 2019, the so-called Imperial Edition MMXIX, fixes most of these issues and is not to be missed, even for those who have long owned a copy of Into Glory Ride.\n\nLong story short, Into Glory Ride is one of Manowar\u2019s finest moments, one of the unquestionable classics of the American metal scene and the entire epic metal genre, serving as solid proof that back when Manowar were still consistently good, they were almost too good to be true.\n\nChoicest cuts: seven swings and no misses, even though \u201cWarlord\u201d is more decent than great and deviates a little from the rest of the material\n\nRating: 9.0 out of 10 points\n",
        "\nJoey and Eric are back on tour, accompanied by whichever hired gun they refuse to give any credit to, a swansong stage at their career - which has been through their fair share of glory and misery.\n\nBeing on the road, and as the book of heavy metal mandates, the now duo have to put some new music out. What fans end up getting with this release is a promise of a marvelous epic tale of faithfully represented Hellenic mythology under the name of \"Highlights from the Revenge of Odysseus.\" \n\nThe EP is a preview of a 30+ minutes song which should be included in the band next full-length release - a weird move to release an unfinished song in my opinion. As promoted through studio clips released to the public, to accomplish this job the duo envisioned adding long narrated intros and outros in greek language - which is a nice way to allineate most of your audience for the sake of authenticity.\n\nIn the middle of the EP's first 8 minutes of self-indulgent preludes, there's a half-baked ballad called Where Eagles Fly. This comes and goes without causing any impression other than \"Eric is still alive\" and able to sing.\n\nThe only actual metal song on this release, Immortal, sounds like a Battle Hymns ripoff, using the same tempo and same structure, but not the same energy and guts. The bass sound is crunchy and well mixed, but the drums are clearly a virtual instrument - which contradicts the efforts to raise the bar in production value and epicness - and Eric's voice sounds less powerfull than the ballad before. \n\nThe EP serves little purpose to the bands catalogue other than exist. It creates no positive expectation for the upcoming album. Instead of releasing a focused EP such as Thunder in the Sky (2009), with a few songs that the audience could expect to hear during the ongoing tour. Manowar prepares us to a sorefest with reused ideas, bringing the worst moments of the band to mind - the awful long intro-outro carnage seen in Gods of War (2007). Theres also the inherent risk of a first-time listener of the band getting this EP first and ruining their experience with what once was one of the most inspiring, fun and energetic metal bands from the United States.\n\nBased on this release I would first buy a ticket to Ross The Boss than to the other half of what is left from Manowar. There's very little to expect from this band based on this \"Highlights\".\n",
        "\nPretty much ignored and sometimes even discredited by the vast majority of rock enthusiasts worldwide and even a decent amount of self-proclaimed metalheads, United States Power Metal was an influential development in the heavier side of rock music that preceded thrash and European power metal by several years. You won\u2019t read much about it on Rolling Stone or other mainstream sources, but it definitely changed the game for headbangers all over the world. Despite the still underground nature of this movement, the equally passionately loved/hated Manowar arose from that nascent scene during its diaper-wearing years to reach the upper echelons of metaldom, obtaining international iconic status; icons of both the power and the ridicule of metal music as perceived by metalhead and non-metalheads alike. While Manowar themselves call their art \u201ctrue metal\u201d, the USPM label certainly applies to the influence them, and other similarly styled bands (Manilla Road, Warlord, Omen, Brocas Helm\u2026) bestowed upon heavy metal music, with elements unheard before their arrival. \n\nBattle Hymns is a forty-year old statement of this enduring power and influence, the first chapter of one of America\u2019s greatest metal acts of all time. It has two distinct halves; side A definitely rooted in the early heavy metal sound of the late 70s as provided by the classic gods Sabbath, Rainbow, Priest, Scorpions and so forth, and side B, where Joey DeMaio and Ross the Boss\u2019 band started to experiment with faster, harder and more epic sounds. \u201cDeath Tone\u201d and \u201cMetal Daze\u201d are mid-paced rockers, the first one being a tad heavier and the second one possessing a catchier chorus, both concocted from a mixture of the aforementioned influences, while \u201cFast Taker\u201d is, well, faster\u2026 having a stronger Judas Priest flavor, with Eric Adams even channeling some Halford. \u201cShell Shock\u201d is a hard rocker number about \u2018Nam and has a Ted Nugent scent. I know, I know, the guy\u2019s a total moron but back in the seventies he rocked quite hard, and I imagine Ross was influenced by him, like thousands other guitarists. Despite the generic sound of these five tunes, two things add personality and a uniqueness to them: Eric Adams masterful and multi-faceted voice and Chief Joey DeMaio\u2019s potent, muscular bass playing. The Manowar sound is already evidently there, but that\u2019s nothing compared to\u2026\n\nSide B grabs you by the balls with the Saxon-esque \u201cManowar\u201d and never lets go. So far, that\u2019s the heaviest, meanest composition in the LP. This track makes you wanna headbang fucking hard and throw the sign of the hammer, more so than the preceding songs combined. Still, things will get even better with the tremendous epicness and badassery of the two six-minuters at the end of the record. \u201cDark Avenger\u201d is a Frazetta (or his nephew, the great Ken Kelly, R.I.P. 2022) painting come alive. The Deathdealer character clearly comes to mind with the lyrics. DeMaio\u2019s bass has more testosterone than a whole NFL defensive unit, sounding like a modern stoner metal band all by itself. Ross\u2019 riffs are initially doomy, as the composition starts like a slow crusher. The lyrics about tragedy and revenge also bring to mind the first Conan movie, just a couple of months released in cinemas before this album\u2019s own release date (what an epic time to be alive!). After the 2:30 mark, Mr. Orson Welles narration hits you with his vigorous voice, telling us about the titular character\u2019s return from hell. Metal as fuck, this tune has it all, as the explosive conclusion arrives at the 4-minute mark, all hell breaking loose. The final two minutes of the track, the deeds of reckoning by our Dark Avenger, are almost speed metal/proto thrash in intensity.\n\n\u201cI spare not land or servants\nMy wake is smoke and flame\nI take their wives and daughters\nThey stand there watching, watching\nHoping to gain their lives,\nBut when I'm through\nThey know that they must pay\u2026\u201d\n\nRoss the Boss solos are fiery and merciless, and the song finishes as excitingly as it started. The neoclassical shred-fest that is \u201cWilliam\u2019s Tale\u201d might be more of a curiosity than a necessary song here, albeit it works as the bridge between the two mighty epics. A delight for shred-heads, I still listen to that instrumental occasionally, but it remains the weakest song of their debut in terms of amusement. The main course is served last, with the near-seven minutes of \u201cBattle Hymns\u201d closing the record in total epic fashion. A mid-paced tune with martial riffs and an immortal chorus, I finally got to listen to it live at the barely pre-pandemic 2019 Hell & Heaven Metal Fest here in Mexico, where Manowar were the main attraction by a landslide. The keyboard and percussion samples on this monument of metalness are spot on, giving the song added depth. I love Eric Adams passionate singing here, and I\u2019m never sure if this one or \u201cDark Avenger\u201d are my favorites from their debut, but both are highly ranked in my all-time, all-genre metal favorites list. \n\n1982, what an epic year. Needless to say, the 2010 reworked version, while not total crap, is totally unnecessary, just a minor curiosity to experience once or twice in a lifetime, mainly because of Sir Chirstopher Lee\u2019s replacing Orson Welles. Oddly, the deaths of both luminaries of the arts are separated by exactly 30 years, almost coinciding with both Battle Hymns versions release date. Another oddity was the fact that original drummer Donnie Hamzik played on both versions. He really complemented well DeMaio on the original one, using some double bass here and there, but mostly providing a capable backbone for the rest of the instruments. The original mix is almost flawless, and even though Battle Hymns was just the beginning for Manowar and they have more celebrated records, this one\u2019s among the best for me, though not the top one.\n",
        "\nManowar's image has been so culturally shaken that it is a band that is hard for many to take seriously, if there is a clear definition of things that age badly we can say that Manowar clearly accumulates and carries a long list of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes associated with metal that make a large part of their extensive career today seem like a parody band trying to push the limits of the most standardised image that an outsider can have of this type of music, Manowar reflects this with their image as well as with their music.\n\nBut there was a moment where after twelve years of career and six studio albums behind them, Manowar for some reason decided to embark on an adventure that even today 30 years later there are people who still cannot believe it exists, at some point the incredibly cheesy and simplistic Manowar decided to write a song of epic dimensions about the Iliad, with a duration of almost thirty minutes \"Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts\" is one of the most unique pieces of the discography of the American band. Much has been discussed and written about this song in particular and of course I have come to contribute my grain of sand to the conversation.\n\nFirst I must say that I have quite a fascination for long songs, I still remember a very young version of me to whom the six minutes of \"Agent Orange\" seemed long, it was not until I got into the progressive rock from the 70's that I started to develop that interest, I noticed that the songs I liked the most were those that drastically exceeded my concept of normal length, \"Close to the Edge\" \"Supper`s Ready\" \"Thick as a Brick\".... The longer the song lasted the more I liked it, I recreated myself in them, I loved to learn them by heart after dozens of listens, and even so they always surprised me and managed to remain interesting, I began to believe that the longer a song was the more likely it was to be good, so I started to use the length of the songs to decide which albums I gave them a chance, the longer the songs were the more they caught my attention. It was at that time that I met Manowar and quickly my attention focused solely on the main song on this album.\"Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts\" was my introduction to Manowar and for a long time the only song I listened to from them, although there was a subtle detail, I could never finish it. I had listened to songs longer than this one but I was unable to finish it, I tried several times but always ended up bored to death, so I gave it up for impossible. It's been quite a few years since then, I know Manowar better but I always deliberately ignored this album mainly because of that song, so recently I decided, with some hesitation, to give a chance to that album and to that song that always got stuck in my throat.\n\nIt is true that one can criticize several aspects of the epic \"Achilles... \"mainly its exaggerated artificial way of lengthening it with those drum and bass solos, it is incredibly pompous and pretentious with its choruses, its bell sounds and its (almost) acapella parts, in just five minutes we have already entered an instrumental part that is based on a crecendo of the same chord played over and over again to appear more epic than it actually radiates to leave us at the mercy of a very early drum solo that only serves to lengthen the song, this is terrible and no wonder I rarely got through this part when I was younger. That's why I'm so surprised that I like the song so much nowadays. I still believe everything I mentioned previously, the song structure is questionable and the solos are pure filler, but just because they are filler doesn't mean it's bad per se. There is something to keep in mind and that is that for this album Manowar had two musicians that would not be repeated in any other studio album of the band, and although it seems that they did not participate in the writing of this song, the talent of David Shankle on guitar and Rhino on drums has much of the responsibility for the immense quality of this song, it is impossible not to emphasize the performance of both of them. In \"Death Hector's Reward\" is when finally all the previous slow build up takes shape in an incredibly heavy and fast segment where the four members shine immeasurably, a powerful galloping riff, insane blast bleats and a bass so strong you can feel it in your chest lead us to the vocal performance of Eric Adams where he recites fiercely and effectively the literary lyrics interspersing his classic voice with high pitched screams and short very effective lows, It's not just that it's an incredibly well done part, but the contrast to the sly tone that had previously clashed so strongly with this one of the hardest moments musically that Manowar have ever done that I can only surrender at them every time this part comes on. \n\nBut the best thing is that this is not the only part that reaches these parameters, after some effective bass and guitar solos we enter the final part of the song, the structure is repeated again, an intense galloping riff accompanied by a huge bass and an incredible and extremely fast drums, the intensity is so high for so many minutes that no wonder there are people who thought it was a drum machine. With greatness Eric Adams finishes his vocal part and Manowar gives us the last pearl of this great work, as they close the song that narrates the duel between Achilles and Hector, with two minutes of a vertiginous and virtuous guitar duel as a perfect way to close a song full of charisma and musical talent, the final apotheosis that the song needed.\n\nAnd after such an immeasurable song, its continuation is \"Metal Warriors\" a song that has such powerful lyrics as \"If you're not into metal, you are not my friend\" followed by the most basic drum sequence in history and a chorus that has been played down to the core, the drop in quality and tone is so big that I simply cannot fit it in my head, it's as if Michelangelo after sculpting \"David\" sculpted a morning stool right before, it's like scoring a goal in the 94th minute in the Champions League final and celebrating it with a Fornite dance, it's stupid and wrong on so many levels that it can't be described. One could say that this would have been solved if the track \"Achilles...\" was the last song, but I'm sure that would also affect the perception with which you come to it because most of the rest of the songs on the album are incredibly boring, bland and too long for an album that already contains a twenty-eight minute track. \"Spirit Horse of the Cherokee\" is one of the few exceptions, with a bridge led by Eric Adams that works very well thanks to the rhythm that the song carries and \"Burning\" has the same problem of being extremely slow like the other songs but they shorten the instrumentation so it is not as tedious as \"The Power of Thy Sword\" or \"The Demon's Whip\". Of course everything at the level of instumentization and production is fine, the sound is more Manowar style but it feels very insipid after what they have presented us previously, very few tracks keep the type and others like the already mentioned \"Metal Warriors\" or the disgusting \"Master of the Wind\" seem like a parody in comparison, as much as I love the band's style and their fucking ability to write choruses that work no matter the circumstances, but I don't buy it on this album, they've put the honey on my lips and I refuse to accept any other substitute.\n\nAt the end of the day, when I come back to this album it will only be for the opening track, it's true that it's not perfect but I personally appreciate Joey DeMaio's ability to step out of his comfort zone and write and perform a song so far out of his style and reach such high peaks on it to the point of probably being the best song Manowar has ever done, for that alone it was worth giving this album a chance again.\n",
        "\n1984 was a year that was a watershed for both metal in general and for Manowar in particular. It was a year resplendent with seminal releases by Metallica, Motley Crue, Twisted Sister, and W.A.S.P. , to name a few. It was also the year that Manowar was inducted (for the first time) into the Guinness Book of World Records for loudest performance. It was amid all these exciting happenings that \"Hail To England\", Manowars third full-length was unleashed. Rated number 87 on Rolling Stone magazines \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\", \"Hail To England\", is a triumphant farewell to their early years as a band while containing tantalizing indications of where they go next. It is a tour de force of everything that makes Manowar great encapsulated into 7 economical and well-thought out songs. By this time, they had established what is considered by many to be the classic line-up in the form of one Scott Columbus (drums) and stalwarts Eric Adams (vocals), Ross the Boss (guitars) and of course, Joey DeMaio (bass). \n\n\"Hail To England\" opens with the ass-kicking \"Blood Of My Enemies\". From the opening notes, it's apparent that we are listening to a Manowar that has progressed both musically and aesthetically. Gone are mid-tempo rockers about motorcycles punctuated with cowbells, replaced instead by intricate Maiden-esque rhythms and better song dynamics than ever. The lyrics of \"Blood Of My Enemies\" are brief and repetitive, but are almost biblical in scope: \"Three sons have I and they ride by my side/The fierce, the black and the wicked are their names/We ride down my enemies on their half hearted flight/No voice of mercy, no evangels of light\" I mean...it's a pretty impressive leap forward. \"Each Dawn I Die\" and \"Kill With Power\" come in rapid succession, hitting like hammer slaps. \"Each Dawn I Die\" possesses a rhythmic quality that would be replicated years later by Early Man on \"Death Is The Answer\" off of 2005s \"Closing In.\" The title track contains a jaunty feel that is capable of simultaneously evoking both medieval England and Monty Pythons \"The Holy Grail\", complete with mention of going to England to search for the aforementioned Grail-this is Manowar, after all, so maybe some unintentional silliness is inevitable but the utter lack of irony is what really endears one to them. Funnily enough (according to some), the title of \"Hail To England\" is a tribute to where the band was formed, but other versions say that it actually serves as an apology of sorts to their British fans for cancelling a tour there, which brings us to the next jam \"Army Of The Immortals\". \"Army Of The Immortals\" is basically (and perhaps a little astonishingly) a love letter to their fans and functions a little like \"S.M.F.\" from Twisted Sisters opus \"Stay Hungry\" of the same year. It could not be further removed from the \"wimps-and-posers-leave-the-hall-we'll-kick-your-ass\" lyrical approach of later years-in fact, it almost borders on humility, which is massively uncharacteristic of Manowar. \n\nFrenetic bass solo \"Black Arrows\" (with it's hilarious opening dedication) serves as a great intro to the final song on \"Hail To England\", entitled \"Bridge Of Death\". \"Bridge Of Death\" is arguably the most epic track on this album, and even then, it only clocks in at 8:57. The feel of the song thematically is a little like \"Keeper of the Seven Keys\" by Helloween but without the lengthy guitars solos, and yes, it does mention Satan in the lyrics.\n\nAnd with that, \"Hail To England\" concludes. A lot of the greatness of \"Hail To England\" is owed to the economic and mindful length of the songs, their placement and the actual amount of songs themselves. There is no filler, no weepy ballads, no songs written with the top 40 in mind. Criticisms? Sure. The guitar tone could be a little heavier/less buzzy but the bass compensates beautifully. The unevenness of past and future releases puts the quality of \"Hail To England\" into even starker contrast: the first 2, still heavily rooted in '70s hard rock, the largely overlooked \"Sign Of The Hammer\", the mainstream-flirting \"Fighting The World\" and \"Kings Of Metal\" and the batshit crazy listening experience that is \"The Triumph Of Steel\". It was a perfect confluence of both happenstance and planning that would never be replicated by Manowar again. I daresay this is not only Manowars best album but the band at their most dignified, if grown men dressed as Conan the Barbarian can be considered dignified. All jokes aside, if you are to remember Manowar, remember them at this moment in their existence.\n",
        "\nFormed in upstate New York on the onset of the 1980's by ex-Black Sabbath road crew member Joey DeMaio, ex-Dictator Ross the Boss and fellow barbarian enthusiasts Eric Adams and Karl Kennedy, Manowar is one of those singularly American bands who have experienced some success in overseas markets while remaining a largely cult band in their native United States (see Riot for another good example of this as well as Anvil, even though admittedly Anvil are Canadian and not American). They are as equally loved by some as they are considered a laughing stock by others but a fair assessment would be that they are a little like the Village People of metal: of questionable seriousness and undeniable campiness. They (annoyingly) get lumped into the \"power metal\" sub genre of heavy metal but honestly, in a similar fashion to bands such as Killing Joke and Celtic Frost, they simply exist in their own universe, one populated by warriors, kings, and \"powerheads\" (?) It is a universe that is impervious to trends, common sense or decent taste. \n\nAfter clawing their way up the label food chain for the first half of the 1980's, 1988 saw Manowars major label debut in the form of \"Kings of Metal\". Do they deserve the title? In some ways, yes, and in more ways, no. The variety, consistency and quality of the material on \"Kings of Metal\" differs wildly from song to song and often within the actual songs themselves. There are only a handful of songs that can be considered heavy metal with a bunch of filler and some power ballads (this was the 80s after all) thrown in for good measure.\n\nIt opens with the thrashy and uptempo \"Wheels of Fire\". It's not a bad jam per se. The keyboard accents are a little corny and the chorus really does not gel very well with the verse, which seems a little Metallica-inspired. But overall, I like it. The title track follows after, and it lyrically contains the kind of boastful self-aggrandizing/shit-talking that made them a source of eye-rolling derisiveness to most people. The actual song itself is pretty heavy and anthemic, just a little silly: you need to tell people how heavy you are and they're wimps if they can't handle you? Um, ok. Subsequent songs like \"Heart of Steel\", \"Kingdom Come\" and the dreary \"The Crown and the Ring (Lament of the Kings)\" scream major label rib-elbowing, particularly the panoramic \"Kingdom Come\", whose chords and even solo remind me a little of \"Learning to Fly\" by Pink Floyd from the previous year. Joey Demaios quizzical bass solo track \"Sting of the Bumblebee\" and the laughable spoken-word track \"The Warriors Prayer\" (framed as a grandfather telling his grandson a story about the \"metal kings\") seem as if they are simply there to contend with the extended running time of the fairly new (at the time) media of CD-they're a waste of running time and also fail to convince the listener of either the virtuosity of Joey DeMaio or the dramatic range of Manowar, respectively. The actual heavy songs that share the second half of \"Kings of Metal\"? For the most part, they rule. \"Hail and Kill\" is both heavy and catchy and that goes for \"Blood of the Kings\" as well. Both of these jams are prime Manowar. As for \"Pleasure Slave\"...I'm not offended it by it, but in light of all the kidnappers/ serial killers of women that predominated in the 1980s, it seems a little in bad taste. The questionability is retroactively further compounded by revelations concerning later guitarist and alleged pedophile, (the uncharacteristically scrawny for Manowar) Karl Logan.\n\nTo summarize, \"Kings of Metal\" deserves it's 80% rating but with rationalization. If one mentally re-works \"The Warriors Prayer\" as an intro to \"Blood of the Kings\", it flows far better but the aforementioned \"Sting of the Bumblebee\" and \"The Crown and the Ring\" remain infuriatingly wasteful. \"Sting of the Bumblebee\" doesn't utterly ruin \"Kings of Metal\", but it does disrupt its flow in a similar fashion that \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" did for Megadeth's \"So Far...So Good...So What!\" of the same year. If it had been, (for example) the first track on side B, it would've made more sense. All of this is thrown in to even greater contrast when \"Kings of Metal\" is (invariably) compared to earlier, superior releases such as the economical and trim \"Hail to England\". It seems that on \"Kings of Metal\", Manowar were trying to create within the restraints of the major label apparatus with a producer who lacked the needed imagination to combine the elements that make Manowar heavy with mainstream appeal. Bob Rock did it for Metallica on the Black Album, but Manowar ain't no Metallica and Jason Flom ain't no Bob Rock, neither. However, \"Kings of Metal\" does work well as a primer to people who have never encountered Manowar before because it really does compile all the disparate elements of Manowars music in all their badly track listed glory: it's got the heavy tunes, the ballads and the instrumentals. I'm glad this album exists and I'm glad this band exists because only in America would four grown men dress like extras from an 80s barbarian B-movie and release album after album about warriors, kings and other assorted mythological subjects. After the release of this album, Ross the Boss and Chris Columbus left the band, and Manowar defiantly doubled down on the epic, virtuosic insanity on the massive middle finger to the 90s that was \"The Triumph of Steel\" but that is another review, another album and even another decade altogether.\n",
        "\nManowar 4rth released saw the band classic lineup releasing their most consistent material, following the provoking Hail to England and before merging into a more commercial style with Fighting The World. Because it sits on the middle of those two huge releases, Sign of the Hammer tends to be a bit overlooked, but you're missing big if skipping this one. This album is super well rounded, without a single bad moment and made with such an enjoyable production that all instruments sound fantastic. It's arguably the most consistent Manowar album, even at the price of being the most safe.\n\nThe band used tested formulas from the previous albums, including a rock-ish first track and epic-ish closure, here the most original tunes are Mountains, Thor and Guyana, songs that makes this record stand out and be a unskipable Manowar release. Even the mandatory bass solo is present, Thunderpick, and it seems Joey actually wrote an actual piece this time around instead of hitting pure random notes, making it actually enjoyable, and it merges with the following track seamlessly - a huge improvement for Joey's solo moment. My personal favorite track is \"Thor - the powerhead\". If you ever try to learn how to play this song on the guitar, bass or drum you will find how intricate the structures and riffs actually are. Syncopated progression and mute notes make it hard to mimic. \"Thor\" also captures the most common thematic for Manowar lyrics, Nordic legends, with verses that sound like old poems, meaning is not descriptive or didactic, rather using a more storytelling style that makes you want to read more about the characters and events described in the song:\n\nI watched as he shouted\nTo the giants who died that day\nHe held up his hammer high\nAnd called to Odin for a sign\n\nThis is just one prominent example, as the entire album genuinely has very good lyrics, something that Manowar is definitively not receiving much credit for. You just need to approach them as you would typically approach a fiction book. The style used here is lost on later releases and I'm not sure who wrote the lyrics as the credits on the booklet are minimal. But it's a farcry from what the band has devolved later on.\n\nSign of the Hammer and The Oath are double drumming fast songs that establishes the band as the masters of their craft and possibly the best performance of Scott Columbus entire career, the fills on the chorus of The Oath are crazy! This said Sign of The Hammer is Manowar in a nutshell, and some of the tracks survived to concerts decades later, buy it!\n",
        "\n\"Warriors of the World\" marked Manowar's triumphal entry in the 21st century, and what an entry it was! After six years since the previous \"Louder than Hell\", Manowar signed a contract with Nuclear Blast, releasing what is to this day probably the most famous and commercially successful album of their career. \"Warriors of the World\" set the blueprint for the sound of third millennium Manowar, and remains to this day their best opus among their most recent output: the guitars are downtuned to D standard tuning, the riffs are somewhat simpler and rawer, but still effective; the sound is much more polished and extreme than in the past, the guitars sound more distorted, there is a much wider inclusion of choirs and a shift towards a symphonic direction, testified by the inclusion of orchestral elements; the overall sound is more bombastic, epic and extreme than ever, also due to Eric Adam's shift to a lower, grittier register, which often trespasses in a sort of roar; nonetheless, he is still perfectly capable of belting some really high notes, his vibrato is as strong as ever and his high pitched screams sound more ferocious than ever before: his performance is simply stellar, both on a technical and interpretative/expressive level.\n\nJoey De Maio doesn't shred as much as in previous albums, but still he complements the songs with some really nice bass arrangements and he often embellishes his lines with stylish phrasings, as seen in \"Call to Arms\", \"Hand of Doom\" or in \"Warriors of the World United\", where he displays his trademark fast slide technique; spot on his bass tone as well. The late Scott Columbus provided one of his best performances here: his style is raw, but it perfectly complements the compositions, and his ability with the double bass is unquestionable. Guitarist Karl Logan shines at his best, performing stellar solos, rock-solid rhytms and providing walls of feedback in the title track, thus proving to be a real master of the axe. The production, as mentioned before, is much cleaner and aggressive than in previous releases, thus perfectly complementing the change in the style of the compositions; the whole album sounds extremely epic, bombastic and anthemic, and the heroic, patriotic and macho lyricism furtherly underlines the general mood of the songs.\n\nThat said, \"Warriors of the World\" is a fantastic album, but it does have some flaws. First of all, out of an eleven-tracks platter, only seven are new, actual songs; the remaining four tracks split between two orchestral interludes and two covers. Considering that in the same year Manowar released the excellent \"The Dawn of Battle\" EP, including two of the very best songs Manowar have recorded in the new millennium, and that were featured as mere bonus tracks in the \"Gold Edition\" of the album, I sincerely believe that leaving them out of the main platter on behalf of two covers, although well-executed, was a mistake. People buy albums for the sake of the new material: I understand that the \"Nessun Dorma\" cover was a tribute to Eric Adam's late mother, and that \"An American Trilogy\" was meant to sound as a patriotic tribute to the USA, but \"I Believe\" and \"The Dawn of Battle\" really deserved a place on the album, and they would have definitely added to the final product, while the covers would have been better as simple bonus tracks. \n\nAnother flaw is represented by the odd structure of the platter: after the fantastic opening represented by the anthemic \"Call to Arms\", the tracks from 2 to 6 consist in ballads or semi-ballads, while track number 7 \"The March\" is nothing but an orchestral intro to the title track. This strange choice results in a sort of stagnation, musically speaking, of the first half of the album, while the last four tracks are \"all killer - no filler\", and indeed the second half of the record results significantly stronger and more engaging; still, the quality of the original material featured in \"Warriors of the World\" is unquestionable. \"Call to Arms\" is a fantastic way to start the album: the solo, the chorus, the stanzas, the galloping pace, its anthemic and martial attitude make it a real Manowar classic; \"Fight for Freedom\" is a patriotic, romantic semi-ballad, while \"Swords in the Wind\" is the most emotional and varied song of the lot: it's another moving ballad, talking about the ascension of the warriors into Valhalla after death, and it's one of the best songs Manowar have written after the year 2000.\n\nNonetheless, in with the last four tracks comes the real deal. \"Warriors of the World United\" is Manowar's most famous song; it's definitely atypical if compared to the rest of their catalogue, the solo is skipped in favour of a part where Eric sings alone, backed only by some keyboards and choirs, the riffing is extremely simple and almost industrial-sounding, the drumming is minimalist and the song in general sounds like a sort of hybrid between heavy metal, industrial metal and Opera music (due to the heavy use of the choirs), but that's probably the very reason why it sounds so glorious and unique: the crushing mid-paced attitude, the fantastic buildup of the intro, the aggressive, blood-pumping stanzas and lyrics, the glorious, anthemic and epic feeling of the choruses and the fantastic choral arrangements result in a timeless, classic piece of well-deserved fan-favourite reputation. \"Hand of Doom\" and \"House of Death\" are the darkest, fastest, most aggressive and heaviest songs of the album, completely packed with roaring vocals, ferocious screams, brutal, primitive riffing and unforgettable vocal lines, while the closing piece \"Fight Untile We Die\" is a real thrash assault, featuring some of the best riffing of the entire album and the most complex vocal lines, closing the feast with a real declaration of intents, in the most glorious way possible. \n\nAll in all, despite some minor flaws in the number of \"fillers\", some choices in which tracks to include in the album and in the structure of the platter, \"Warriors of the World\" is a fantastic effort, that will delight any power/heavy/epic metal aficionado and the most seasoned Manowarriors alike. If you're looking for self-empowering and adrenaline, pathos and epic, this album is for you!\n",
        "\n\"The Final Battle I\" is the first of a series of three EPs that will form what is supposed to be Manowar's final album. This brilliant stunt is the umpteenth marketing escapade figured out by Joey De Maio to drain as much money as possible from the fans before the band's final departure, a trend that has been plaguing Manowar's reputation for the past fifteen years or so and that once again made more than a few people turn their noses up, and rightfully so I may add. That is the reason why, unsurprisingly, \"The Final Battle I\" was received with hostility and often unnecessary, excessive criticism, despite being an at least decent effort. The fact is that \"The Final Battle I\" is a mixed bag, a product that sees the band swinging between moments of inspiration and moments that totally lack inspiration, successful experimentation and plain bad ideas. \n\nAfter the bombastic and orchestral intro \"March of the Heroes Into Valhalla\" (a clear throwback to the \"Gods of War\" days), we get the first actual song of the platter, named \"Blood and Steel\". The track has a sort of \"The Lord of Steel\" era vibe, while the production results immediately lacking in the guitar department, with the axe sounding too thin and flat, although the general result is far better than in Manowar's aforementioned 2012 effort. Another flaw is represented by the drumming, which is far too basic, but despite this, the song results enjoyable, thanks to the catchy vocal lines, the simple yet nice riffing and Eric Adam's passionate interpretation, accompanied by a well-studied use of the choirs.\n\nThe 65-years old frontman is as usual the real star of the album, providing an incredibly solid and emotional performance and being able to reach some really high notes despite his age. Truly one of the best heavy metal singers of all times, as made even clearer by his interpretation of the second and strongest track of the album, the moving ballad \"Sword of the Highlands\". This track is a real gem, completely packed with a well-studied, pathos-fueled structure, an atmospheric use of the choirs, piano arrangements, an anthemic chorus, emotional, varied vocals and a surprising inclusion of some bagpipes arrangements, a small yet crucial feature that results in a real breath of fresh air for Manowar; how I wish they would experiment more in this direction!\n\nIf the mini-album stopped here, I could fairly rate it a 75/100 and call it a success if we consider the late stage of the band's career, but unfortunately the final song \"You Shall Die Before I Die\" is far from being as solid as the other two. To cut things short, this track sees Joey De Maio handling vocal duties, in the form of a pseudo-growled register which is nothing else than his shouted vocals layered together and drowned with effects. The instrumental, although far from stellar, isn't that bad per se, the use of the choirs and of the orchestrations is indeed surprisingly well-integrated with the music and effective, but unfortunately this sense of epic and the whole build-up are ruined by the vocals, that sound unconvincing to say the least. This track is probably the most experimental thing Manowar have performed in ten years or so, and thus it makes me even sorrier to say that, unfortunately, it's far from being a success.\n\nAs anyone can get from what I wrote above, \"The Final Battle I\" is not the utter disaster that some claim it to be, but it's not a triumph either. De Maio tried to experiment further with his songwriting, at times succeeding, at times utterly failing; what is left is a decent effort (especially if compared to \"The Lord of Steel\" or the unneeded and pretentious re-recordings of \"Battle Hymns\" and \"Kings of Metal\"), that leaves me wondering if the other two EPs that are supposed to follow will be equally disjointed, or if they will be able to positively surprise us.\n",
        "\n\"The Dawn of Battle\" is an EP including two previously unreleased songs, namely the title track and \"I Believe\", that were initially destined to feature on the \"Warriors of the World\" album, plus the song \"Call to Arms\", which is the opening piece of the aforementioned LP. I'm not gonna lie, these three tracks are among the best material modern Manowar has ever put out, with \"Call to Arms\" and \"The Dawn of Battle\" probably claiming a place among the top ten songs Manowar have ever released. At the same time, this very fact leaves the listener a little puzzled, if you consider that the first two songs included in this LP were did not make it to the \"Warriors of the World\" album, whose final platter featured instead two (!) covers that, although well-executed, are nowhere near the quality of the material found here. My guess is that this was the first of the long series of infamous marketing choices carried out by Joey De Maio during the 21st century, and that eventually undermined the band's reputation, at least partially.\n\nAnyway, an excellent album as \"Warriors of the World\" could have assurged to god-tier, had all of the stuff featured on this EP made it to the LP's platter. \"I Believe\" is a sort of simple, yet extremely well-constructed and composed semi-ballad, featuring explosive and passionate vocals by Eric Adams, who employs a lower register if compared to Manowar's past century releases, and a fantastic solo by Karl Logan. The chorus is incredibly catchy and it's combined with the self-empowering lyrics in a way that will make it unforgettable already after the first listen; spot on the organ orchestrations and the epic choirs as well.\n\n\"The Dawn of Battle\" is the strongest song of the platter, featuring thrashy riffs, excellent double bass drumming by the late Scott Columbus, complex guitar/bass patterns, an atmospheric and epic solo and once again extremely effective choirs and keyboards. Eric Adams sings the lyrics with passion and ferocity, shifting from the almost roared and gritty low-register vocals of the stanzas, to the high-pitched notes of the chorus, to the incredibly touching interpretation of the middle section, where his clean singing is backed only by the atmospheric keyboard arrangements. Once again, blood-pumping lyrics and unforgettable, as epic as possible vocal lines are the final icing on the cake, making this song assurge to the pantheon of Manowar's best tracks ever. \n\nNo need to indulge in the description of \"Call to Arms\", already present on the Manowar's 2002's LP and being one of its highlights; on the other hand, a mention about the incredible production is necessary: Manowar never achieved again such a stellar studio sound, an incredibly balanced mix with every element, effect and instrument sounding more bombastic and powerful than ever. \"The Dawn of Battle\" is an excellent EP, and it includes some of the best material modern Manowar has ever produced: a must for any fan of the band, or for anyone who likes heavy metal in its most epic incarnation.\n",
        "\n\"Into Glory Ride\" is, well, quite a ride. This was released in 1983. Freakin 1983. Back then, the heaviest bands were Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Diamond Head and early thrash. How Earth shattering this must have been for that time.\n\nWhen put next to Manowar's other albums, the band demonstrates the great range and diversity of their music while still meeting their standard of being \"true metal\". A lot of people like to throw the doom metal label on this album and they are right. This album is slower than Manowar's usual stuff. Traditional heavy metal might be a more appropriate title, but doom metal totally works on this. I think Manowar puts a lot of effort on the composing aspect of their music, something I feel like a lot of other bands could work on. There's a difference between composing and songwriting. When someone says \"composer\" you usually think of classical composers like Bach, Handel, etc., guys that wrote their music note for note on paper. Not saying that Manowar wrote their music down first before recording it cause they probably didn't do that (and in my experience, it doesn't work for metal). When someone says \"songwriter\" you'll probably think of more modern artists with little technical ability. I see songwriting as focusing on the structure and overall \"feel\" or rhythm of the song while composing focuses on the notes of the music, mostly done by instruments. Just take a listen to \"Secrets Of Steel\" and the melody that you would surely catch (pretty sure it's in the chorus, first played in the beginning by guitar and bass before the verse riff). The chord progression/modulation is just brilliant! Pretty sure it's from 0:05 to 0:46 They do something like this again in \"Hatred\". The famous melody to the words, \"My strength is Hatred, torment and pain.\" I can't keep my mind off of it! This is what happens when you focus on the composing aspect of music! Compare that to \"Louder Than Hell\" which lacks compositional focus in some songs and instead goes directly to the chugging the root note to whatever chord the band is playing to. If Manowar could have applied what they did on \"Revelation (Death's Angel)\" to parts of \"Return Of The Warlord\" or \"Brothers Of Metal (Part 1)\". \n\nRoss \"The Boss\" Friedman is one of my favorite guitarists and a guitarist who's style I am pretty good at emulating. Every song had a good solo really, but if I had to highlight the ones that stick out, \"Secrets Of Steel\", \"Gloves Of Metal\", and \"Hatred\" are my picks. Joey DeMaio is an interesting bass player. Some people don't like using picks on basses. Manowar's bass parts can get unorthodox and really call for the use of a pick. I think Joey DeMaio uses an 8-string bass on this album, with each string doubled with a string an octave higher than the four low strings we're all familiar with. I don't know if he uses it on the entire album though. Mr. DeMaio uses this to add a lot of color to the compositional focus of this album and play some bass parts in a higher pitch than what you would normally do on a bass and it sounds beautiful. This truly unleashes the potential the bass guitar can have in a band. If you want to know what I mean, listen to the bass sequence from 2:48-2:56 in \"Hatred\". He does this a few more times throughout the song. The bass really stands out throughout the whole album so take your pick really. There's a video of Joey DeMaio recording the bass parts to the re-recording of \"Battle Hymn\" where he uses a bass that fits my description.\n\nRidiculous? Yeah, I'll give you that, but it's good stuff musically! It's creative, heavy, and brilliant from a compositional/songwriting standpoint. The inspiration it gave to power metal is clear, especially in the album artwork. Even if you hate and dismiss them as a Spinal Tap band, you cannot deny that they truly, truly believe in what they do. They maintain this authenticity at ALL times. My personal liking of metal soared listening to this album, making me never want to give it up. Their blend of great composing, doom metal aspects, great guitar solos, giving the bass guitar more purpose than it has ever had, and of course, glorious melodies make this album one for those looking to strengthen their liking of metal.\n",
        "\nSix and a half years after Manowar last released new material in form of the horrible The Lord of Steel, the band has decided to release what is supposed to be its final album in three separate extended plays to make more money. This release is the first of the trilogy and one has to wonder whether the band is ever going to bring the other two to life since it's hard to imagine any overtly positive reactions to this travesty. Those releases might just never come to fruition like the Asgard Saga in collaboration with Wolfgang Hohlbein that was supposed to be released throughout the past decade. Don't get me started on the old-fashioned misogynist cover artwork, the cringe-worthy lyrics or the sub-par production with loud bass guitar sounds and thin electric guitar sounds. Let's strictly talk about the four songs that are offered to anyone who is still willing to give this band that has overstayed its welcome by a decade and a half another shot.\n\n''March of the Heroes into Valhalla'' is an instrumental overture with a weird break that basically separates the tune into two even shorter instrumental tracks. It's not the first time the band has done this as could be witnessed on the endlessly dragging Gods of War. The music manages to establish an epic atmosphere even though it would have had even more energy with actual orchestral sounds instead of keyboard sounds recalling scores for adventure video games of the nineties. One also has to wonder whether such a short extended play consisting of only four songs in total even needed an instrumental overture. The track is average, forgettable and you should skip it right away.\n\n''Blood and Steel'' is an average mid-paced heavy metal tune with domineering bass guitar sounds, decently employed keyboard layers, thin electric guitar riffs and stoic drum patterns that don't impress much. The emotional, epic and skilled vocals by Eric Adams who is going to celebrate his sixty-fifth birthday this year save the tune from mediocrity.\n\n''Sword of the Highlands'' is the best track on here and this above average tune would have even been great if it had been about two minutes shorter towards the end. The cinematic keyboard layers, smooth bagpipe sounds and diversified vocals make this gradually more intense ballad stand out. It's rather a song one would expect from other heavy metal bands like Grave Digger and it's interesting to see Manowar try out something new so late in its career.\n\nExtended play closer ''You Shall Die Before I Die'' also tries out something new but that isn't positive in said case. That's actually an understatement. That might be the single worst song Manowar has ever written. Instrumentally, this song is unspectacular which would make this track boring and forgettable. However, the terrible vocal performance by Joey DeMaio makes this track unintentionally funny. He sounds like a grumpy grandfather who is about to have a stroke. The performance is somewhere between theatrical spoken word efforts and low growls that don't have anything to do with extreme metal but rather with a slightly irritated dog. The track could have been average if it had been sung by Eric Adams but nobody seems to have had the courage to tell Joey DeMaio that he was committing an atrocity. The unusual closer doesn't leave anyone wanting for more and should make most listener wish the band just called it quits already.\n\nManowar's The Final Battle I isn't a triumphant victory but a dragging defeat. The final result is painfully average and should only please to unconditional Manowar fans who would even praise the recording of Joey DeMaio's farts as masterful true metal. To be fair, this extended play is better than the vapid The Lord of Steel and the unnecessary new recordings of past records which makes this release the best since the Thunder in the Sky extended play ten years earlier. However, this new release is still worse than anything Manowar has recorded in the first three decades of its career which speaks volumes for the quality of the band's accomplishments for the past ten years. Manowar should just quickly complete its final tour and call it quits. Aside of delusional true metal followers who would like to be brave warriors surrounded by female sex slaves as the characters in Manowar's lyrics and on their album covers instead of having boring or no jobs and being domineered by people around them, nobody really wants to listen to any new Manowar material anymore.\n",
        "\nOk everyone here we have one of the defining releases from true metal stalwarts Manowar. This is the record where they took the nest step on their journey of steely metal and proclaimed themselves as the reigning kings of metal\u2026hence the album and title track. This record is about a few choice topics that may or may not resound with people depending on their own views. Are you a man who thinks the manliest act one can take is to have a good cry? Well lyrically I doubt you are going to find much of interest here. Is toxic masculinity a valid topic of discussion for you? Well you may as well move on if so, there is probably a \u201cpower metal\u201d band singing songs of vulnerability that will fit your sensibilities better. And there is nothing wrong with that. Not everyone can be devoted to epic victory against all odds. This is pure machismo and power grooved into vinyl in the form of songs about steel, power, glory, metal, victory, battle, Manowar, metal, and honor. I would say this is the ultimate expression of what is Manowar, and you either buy in completely or end up confused and possibly insulted when you realize that you are the poser they are railing against.\n\nHere you have pure speed burners like the opening track, Wheels of Fire. The best biking tune of all time? Maybe. Its pure speed with a stereo effect giving the impression that Eric Adams is coming at you from all sides. Chaotic and frantic with a nice galloping drum beat in the chorus. You have the title track where they proclaim their reign for the entire world to acknowledge. This is a call and response cut between Adams and Ross the Boss with kind of a bouncy feel to it. A bit crunky? Adams regales the listener with tales of the glory that is being a member of Manowar. A life on the road filled with exploding speakers and cracker jack clothes wearing wimps being ground into the dustbins of history. Some nice lead work by The Boss on this and most of the other tracks. He\u2019s tossing in nice licks here and there as he goes back and forth with Adams. Along those lines is the slow opening but hard finishing epic Hail and Kill. When it kicks in the energy is viscous and frenzied mostly due again to Adams. This is Conan the Barbarian in song form filled with battle, glory, death, rape, and razing your fucking enemy until there is nothing left but a smoldering ruin. Great solo by Ross, again a common feature of most tracks. The chanting Hail and Kill backing gang vocals are addictive as well. A perfect metal song? Its probably what I\u2019d listen to if I needed to get fired up to destroy my foes and defile their homes and culture. I would take the rape their women as they cry line metaphorically. Manowar also showcase their abijlity to write an amazing ballad in the form of Heart of Steel. A hymn starting with a piano and Adams before it kicks in later as good metal power ballads do. Lyrics are surprisingly about being true and the struggles that entails. \n\nAt heart this is an epic record about the inevitable victory a Manowar fan will experience if he remains true and never stops fighting the world. Usually mid paced but not plodding, it\u2019s more soaring like a raven in the sky. As hinted earlier, on most of the tracks the true star is Eric Adams. His passion and vocal acrobatics sell this shit like he is singing from the deepest depths of his soul, with an intensity that frightens the false and those who want to pose not rock. It is filled with callouts to past works and glories which is kind of obligatory for them. The tunes are full of heavy beats by Scott Columbus with good fills, but he never gets in the way of the vocals or guitars. Joey DeMaio\u2019s base is played with fire and speed with the bass solo showcasing his fast piccolo base playing style. The riffage is heavy and straight-ahead metal with an emphasis on that Manowar riffing style that is so distinctive. \n\nBut wait you are saying? The record has songs that have zero metal in them in the form of The Crown and the Ring and the Warriors Prayer! How can this be pure steel you cry? Well bucko those tracks may be the most metal, most Manowar tracks on the entire record. Sure one is four minutes of spoken word and the other is a chanting piece over an organ. But it is here the Manowar philosophy of might and victory are slammed home the hardest in fact. If you are the type that is threated by aggressive masculinity, then I can see how you are confused by these works. But if you have steel in your veins these will ring true and you will find yourself immersed. In the universe of Manowar heavy metal is as much a way of life as a way of playing and this record makes that clear. \n\nIn the end this is a record you need to buy into or be born into. Filled with speed and fire, passion and independence, and a desire to never be false or to betray that which you hold dear in your heart. This record is the distillation of Manowar and is mandatory for those who love heavy metal and all its over the top glories. If you ignore the themes you may say this isn\u2019t a 98% record. But combined and taken as it is meant to it becomes greater than the sum of its parts. Hail and Kill brothers of metal!\n",
        "\nI listened to \"Triumph Of Steel\" as a Christmas present to myself on Christmas day, 2018. Out of all the Manowar albums I have listened to, (from \"Battle Hymns\" to this one) \"Triumph Of Steel\" is bar none the best in all aspects. If someone asks why Manowar is considered power metal (and hasn't listened to the latter half of \"Sign Of The Hammer\" and \"Fighting The World\"), this album is why. So glorious and triumphant (and cheesy) it is.\n\nSomething very power metaly (yes, power metaly) Manowar did was do a double bass kick to 16th notes, hitting the snare on every beat with the guitar and bass trem picking to those 16th notes to whatever note played. It's kind of a power metal stereotype and a little generic but I thought it was a little interesting to see Manowar do that. My only criticism with their trem picking sections is to do more than just one note. I think they should have made a progression. There's a trem picking section that comes to mind from \"Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy In Eight Parts\" where they trem pick on the note 'B' (2nd fret, 5th string for you guitarists and to give you an idea of what pitch) and they hold this 'B' for quite a while and I just think they should have made more of a riff-type thing, use more notes, make a progression. The sound of this trem picking and bass pedaling sounded really good with Manowar's unmistakable sound.\n\nOne thing that amazes me about Manowar is their range of sound, instrument use, dynamics, and emotions. Their typical image is the loudest, toughest, greatest metal band around. Blazing technical skill, soaring vocals, shredding guitar solos, rumbling (and shredding) bass, thundering drums, all part of Manowar. But they also emphasize their classical influence and bring on these great orchestral parts either on its own or in the background in a slower part of a song. They use this a lot in \"Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy In Eight Parts\". They truly know how to work music and have these orchestral parts with strings, woodwinds, etc. and still have this bada** image. I would say this works because of classical music already being a key influence of metal.\n\nOne thing every Manowar fan knows is that this is the only Manowar album to have David Shankle, one of my guitar heroes and no doubt one of the greatest and fastest guitarists to ever live, on it. He does such an amazing job on this album and on everything after the masterpiece, \"Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy In Eight Parts\", absolutely steals the show. The reason why I say on everything after \"Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy\" is because the whole band steals the show in that song and I'll get to that next. But in every song he just nails it.\n\nThe masterpiece \"Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy In Eight Parts\" deserves a whole review itself. Speaking of orchestration, the guitar orchestra around the 5:02 mark where the guitar itself starts with a beautiful melody then adds other voices and by the 6:30 mark there are maybe 5 or 6 different voices making this huge melody with harmony and playing octaves and I kid you not, it nearly brought me to tears cause it was so awesome. I call it the guitar orchestra cause that's really how they used it. One of my favorite things about this song is that everything got a solo and everyone of those solos were very impressive. Drums got a solo, bass got a solo, and guitar got a solo. The drum solo used a lot of double bass pedaling and answered a lot of my questions about drumming. (I'm not a drummer but I have a huge appreciation for drummers.) The bass solo was later in the song, around the 17-18 minute mark and boy did Joey DeMaio make use of the time he had to solo. Some people who are non-metal fans or are tone deaf (like pop fans) might just hear a bunch of random chaos in the bass solo. I beg to differ. I could hear every note he played and I really loved the bass solo. I highly recommend anyone who wants to play bass this album and Manowar in general. I feel like there are a lot of bass players who want to do awesome stuff like what guitarists do but they don't get to because it can be hard to find out the techniques used by master bassists like Joey DeMaio, Felipe Andreoli, and Markus Grosskopf. If I must say, I have a higher appreciation for bass players than I do drummers. Anyways, the guitar solo for \"Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy\" came very last, around the end of the song. They did something just like what they did in \"Wheels Of Fire\" from \"Kings Of Metal\", this kind of trade-off, question-answer thing every 8 or so measures and it sounded like two guitarists doing it. So pretty much, imagine if David Shankle played \"Wheels Of Fire\".\n\nIn closing, this is definitely Manowar's most triumphant album up to that point. By far their most triumphant album especially from a musical/compositional standpoint. The loud, heavy and fast parts really put in a huge metal pride. The slow, orchestral parts are very beautiful and shows Manowar's range of sound and dynamics. I loved every song on this album, just one criticism: \"Master Of The Wind\" dragged on a bit, almost like it was forced to be written and they had to get it done. Still loved it overall and it was beautiful, just, it dragged a bit. Every musician on this album played to their absolute best, especially David Shankle, a criminally underrated guitarist. This would take some thought, but I would highly consider considering \"The Triumph Of Steel\" a power metal essential. No question however that I would recommend this to anyone looking to become a true metal warrior.\n",
        "\nBy the time I am writing this first review in months, I still can't believe how much I missed from this band. I used to listen to albums like \"Kings of Metal\" and \"Fighting the Word\" with enjoyment, but my ignorant self never knew the epic stuff that Manowar has put out earlier in the 80s. I have heard a lot of people joking about these guys and not taking their music seriously because of how they represent themselves. I can relate to that, but the guys of Manowar actually had very talented musicians and managed to produce some memorable songs. After my abusive phase of constant listening of the \"Sign of the Hammer\" album, my perspective of the band has changed quite a bit, mainly because of how epic this album is. What surprised me the most when I first listened to that album is how old it is, to me, it really did not sound like it was released back in 1984. For that time, the music really sounds new and fresh, even never heard before style-wise in the metal genre.\n\nEven though Manowar is from New York in the US, they never really had much success out there in America, which probably explains the lack of live performances except in Europe. The music does not sound like the typical US heavy metal as well, especially on the album reviewed here. What we have here is a precursor to epic metal and I would not be surprised that many bands took influence from the style of Manowar displayed on this one. Of course, Bathory being my favorite band, Quorthon instantly came to mind after hearing tracks like \"Mountains\" or \"Thor (The Powerhead)\", even if he denied being influenced by them, (see the Venom story as well). Those tracks really caught my mind like basically all the tracks on the Bathory's viking albums because it sounds similar in some ways, like the epicness and a unique atmosphere with the choirs. It's obviously still different as Manowar were more melodic and clean on their overall sound, but I am suspecting an influence on here. \"Sign of the Hammer\" can also be viewed as some sort of experimentation for the band as they did not stick with that sound on subsequent albums.\n\nDespite the exploration of new sounds, like heard in one of the most epic Manowar track \"Guyana (Cult of the Damned)\", the band still has its classic heavy metal sound in \"Animals\" that has a catchy main riff or \"The Oath\" which has a very impressive vocal performance of singer Eric Adams. One special aspect I really enjoyed on this album is the incredible bass of Joey DeMaio, especially in the self-titled song \"Sign of the Hammer\". The introduction is amazing and this actual song somehow defines the mood on this record, mixing the epicness of tracks mentioned above with their typical heaviness with a special mention to the intense drumming of Scott Columbus (R.I.P.). The weakest point on the album are the guitars, they are decent at best compared to the other instruments, as well as being lower in the mix. It's usually not the case in a Manowar album, but I guess they gave more room to the atmosphere on this one.\n\nAmong the eight songs featured on this album, there are one instrumental called \"Thunderpick\", and like in plenty of Manowar albums, the instrumental tracks are basically a bass solo. I am usually not a big fan of these kinds of song and I tend to just skip ahead. However, this one is pretty cool because it's structured and well-composed, unlike some others of their senseless instrumentals like \"Black Arrows\" on the \"Hail to England\" album that I can't even follow the beat. The lyrical content on the album however, is a little bit different from what I already knew of these guys. Despite not being so original most of the time, they innovated a bit for this album with a Norse mythology theme, as the cover art can depict.\n\nTo sums it up, this album to me was a refreshing Manowar experience, with a different sound and approach than their other stuff. It has a few flaws here and there, but in a general overview, It might be my new favorite record from these guys. I would recommend such album to people that like their old school heavy metal with a little plus of epicness in the music. Finally, of course, I must advise to not ignore this album like I did in the past. That was definitely an error that any Manowar listener need to avoid.\n\nThe highlights:\n\nGuyana (Cult of the Damned)\nMountains\nSign of the Hammer\nThor (The Powerhead)\n",
        "\nManowar. If I had to name one of those bands that kept doing music almost in the same style for their entire career, Manowar would be one of the first names I'd think to. When Joey DeMaio founded Magic Circle Music in 2003, something changed though. He started taking a few bands under his label's wing, and one of those bands was the well-renowned Symphonic Power Metal Band from Italy, Rhapsody. It's probably being inspired by their musical style, that Manowar actually tried to make an album different from anything they'd put out in the past. That album is Gods of War.\n\nGods of War is probably Manowar's most ambitious release. It's a concept album about norse mithology, and it includes a lot of symphonic arrangements and narration, trying to be as epic and bombastic as possible, almost like an opera from Richard Wagner.\nFor the first time Manowar tried to make a different album, taking musical influences from other bands. Was their experiment a success?\n\nThe answer is: only partly. The fact is, the band tried to be symphonic, but they weren't actually able to fully integrate the orchestral arrangements with the actual metal songs, save a few cases. For the most part, this album consists of orchestral overtures and intros to the actual heavy metal songs, instead of trying to actually write some symphonic metal tracks, with the exception of the moving ballad \"Blood Brothers\", the title track, and \"Hymn of the Immortal Warriors\". What's the point in pretending to write a symphonic metal album, if you don't try to mix metal and classical music in the actual songs? Speaking of interludes, here comes the main issue of this album: the duration. Closing at more than 73 minutes, almost half of which consist in overtures, intros, interludes, and narration, Manowar's 2007 work seriously drags. The narration in particular can be definitely annoying at times, as the band decided to use an electronically altered voice which sounds pretty cold and unnatural; although the stories about norse mithology are pretty accurate, having to wait for a 5 minutes narration to end before the actual song starts is absolutely boring, especially after listening to a 6 minutes symphonic intro.\n\nThat's a shame, because the songs Manowar pulled out for this album are really, really good, some of them having become real Manowar classics: fast tracks like \"King of Kings\", \"Sleipnir\", \"Loki God of Fire\", or the mid tempo \"Sons of Odin\" are really the album's highlights, and the fact the the guitar solos by Karl Logan are particularly tasteful and technical makes them even more pleasant to listen. Even the slower, epic, bombastic symphonic tracks, like the aforementioned \"Gods of War\", or \"Hymn of the Immortal Warriors\", are definitely worth checking out, and sound different from anything Manowar has written before. Musically speaking, one may argue the rhytmic parts are too much power chord-based; the bass doesn't shred like in previous albums, even though it's perfectly audible in the mix, and the drums are really basic, almost without any fill worth mentioning. But then again, it's post-2000 Manowar, so what did you expect? The songs are still awesome, and that's what counts. The production is excellent, and Eric Adam's performance is really astounding, as always. He goes all-out and sings with passion, providing some really incredible high-pitched screams, especially considering his age.\n\nThe concept album consists of 15 tracks; the final track, the \"bonus\", \"Die For Metal\", deserves a special mention. It's a simple mid-tempo, with a riff that really reminds of Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\"; but seriously, this is the definitive 21st century heavy metal anthem, for sure. It makes you raise your fists up in the air, while your blood is pumping. Really an enjoyable track.\n\n\"Gods of War\" is an album that surely distinguishes itself from the rest of Manowar discography, and, although not being \"bad\" by any means, it does have some serious flaws. On the pros, we have the fact that the songs are really well-written and enjoyable, some of them being different from anything the band has put out before; the solos are excellent, Eric Adam's performance is pure awesomeness, the production is crystal clear, the stories about norse mithology are accurate, and the album does succeed in giving you that epic, bombastic feel. On the other hand, there are way too much interludes, overtures, annoying narration, that increase too much the duration of the CD and make it drag; the band wasn't fully able to integrate the symphonic arrangements with the actual songs, and the drumming is way too simple. All in all, \"Gods of War\" represents an half-succeeded experiment: if you are a Manowar fan, don't miss it, because it does have a lot of awesome songs; just expect something completely different from what they've done before, and, eventually, be ready to skip the fillers.\n",
        "\nI kid, sort of. The truth is Into Glory Ride is the most Sabbath-esque album Manowar would ever release, as most of the songs are slow and doomy. Yes, there are up-tempo numbers such as opener Warlord and Revelation (Death's Angel), but hey, even Paranoid had, um....Paranoid.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice, other than a reversal in quality between intro and proper first song (would have been nice to have the Sam Cooke song \"Only Sixteen\" play in the background rather than some generic orchestra to give the \"comedy\" an extra kick), is the production. While it is still raw, the guitars are buried and distant, which kind of sucks. Part of what made the riffs and songs on Battle Hymns rule so much was their tonality. The leads cut through enough, which is better than the alternative of not cutting through an already shaky guitar sound (see also: Blood Fire Death). The drum sound however, is a big improvement. I generally am not bothered with cardboard sounding toms, but I can't deny it's objectively better when they sound like toms. Whether that's the arrival of Scott Columbus or just better production experience, I'm not entirely sure. Scott does a serviceable job replacing Donnie here, though he wouldn't really come into his own until the next couple of Manowar albums.\n\nHighlights include Secret of Steel, with that fantastic \"where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face\" desert sands main riff. If that doesn't render you blind, the maniacal lead solo from Ross The Boss will. Such a perfect sampler of what this album is about you almost wonder why it wasn't chosen as the first single/music video. But then you remember just how fucking good Gloves of Metal is, and your brain goes \"Oh yeah, that's why\" before immediately splattering itself on the nearest spike. Easily one of the most memorable, all-time classic tunes from Manowar, with a main riff that will dig itself in your head like an Alabama tick. Then of course there is the myth, the legend, the Gates of Valhalla. One of the finest, if not the finest vocal performances of Eric Adams' career, not to mention the innovative way the bass serves as the clean intro. Keep in mind this was long before Steve Harris got his stupid clean intro-actual song-clean outro formula. The main portion of the song features a driving mid-paced attack that at first glance may seem like the Battle Hymn death march is being used, but the bass doubling on the guitar as opposed to the more regal percussive line of Battle Hymn. More like a clever and different enough rhythmic variation. We do see Manowar reuse and in some cases improve upon the template that standard set with March For Revenge (By The Soldiers of Death). For one thing, the clean interlude feels much more emotional, orchestral and dynamic. Battle Hymn's interlude felt slightly more clunky, but as a whole March does not steal the throne from Battle Hymn, nothing does.\n\nBut yes, other than the questionable production, and the slightly less questionable album cover (at least it's not Anthology, though that mace Eric is holding looks way too small), Into Glory Ride lands Manowar a checkmark in the win column. If you like your power metal vast and slow, give this a listen.\n",
        "\nThe first time I ever saw a music journalist using negative digits to rate a record was when Manowar released the highly controversial Gods of War release. In retrospect, there were a couple of really good tracks on said album but it was watered down by unnecessary overtures, interludes and useless spoken word passages. Manowar's popularity was already rapidly declining by the time Gods of War Live was released. I would even go further and say this live record is the last good album Manowar has released. The record can be divided into two distinct parts on two separate discs. The first disc is basically a greatest hits compilation played during the Demons, Dragons & Warriors World Tour. The second disc offers the best live cuts from the controversial Gods of War effort by skipping most of the annoying tunes and adding final encore.\n\nThis live record is a great deal for those who own no or only a few Manowar studio records as all important releases and songs are represented here. The energetic opening band anthem \"Manowar\" sets the tone right for the following two hours filled with epic power. \"Call to Arms\" has also become an irresistible band anthem that represents everything Manowar stands for even though it was only five years old when this record was released. Anthemic choirs, heavy guitar riffs, domineering bass guitar, thunderous drums and expressive vocals that are sung, shouted and almost spoken with lyrics about bloody battles define this loud song and this unique band. The first disc doesn't only offer classics but also a few hidden pearls. \"Gloves of Metal\" still describes the spirit of metal accurately, if stereotypically. \"Mountains\" sounds epic and majestic and proves that the band can also succeed when it takes itself seriously. \"Die for Metal\" proves that Manowar was still able to write good songs a decade ago even though the guitar rhythms rip off Led Zeppelin and the lyrics refer to a cringe-worthy interview involving Rock Hard journalist G\u00f6tz K\u00fchnemund and Manowar bassist Joey DeMaio that has become legendary. If you haven't checked it out yet, go ahead and have some fun. However, even the great first disc of this release has a few minor flaws. The bass instrumental \"Son of William's Tale\" that was artificially stretched to a length of four and a half minutes and the overlong noisy coda of \"Black Wind, Fire and Steel\" are for posers only.\n\nThe second disc is hit-and-miss. The epic anthem \"The Sons of Odin\" or the gloomier title track \"Gods of War\" work particularly well on a big stage in front of an enthusiastic crowd. The photos in the high-quality booklet as well as the bonus video of the latter track show that Manowar can be outstanding entertainers. However, some of the interludes like \"The Blood of Odin\" and \"Glory Majesty Unity\" are overlong and slow the show down considerably. While the first disc shows the band's strengths that made it so unique as well as a few stereotypical weaknesses that come along with it, the second disc shows a talented band losing itself in its own narcissistic pompousness. It's not a surprise that what was supposed to be the start of a trilogy about different mythologies never went further than the first part and that the ensuing Asgard Saga didn't result in three albums but only one extended play.\n\nLooking back at this record makes me somewhat nostalgic as it almost feels like a swansong for a band that I once loved and that would go on to disappoint most of its declining fan base over the years following this release. Gods of War Live is mostly enjoyable to listen to and reminds us that Manowar were once one of the very best live bands in the metal scene. If you feel like rediscovering the band's declining but still solid middle years, go give this generous release a few spins.\n",
        "\nI always find myself perplexed that Manowar never really get credit as musical innovators. I'll admit that when Martin Popoff and the BangerTV collective try to classify Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and most traditional metal as power metal, it seems like a stretch, but at least Manowar certainly began the dungeons, dragons, swords and sorcery ethos the subgenre would entrench itself in. \n\nThere are a couple of issues with Battle Hymns. The tom-toms sound like cardboard, and there is a bit of thematic inconsistency. Two or three songs on here deal with trauma from being a soldier in Vietnam, and volleying between that and \"Manowar, born to live forevermore\" is slight whiplash. Not to mention that frankly the record stumbles, rather than charges out of the gate with one of Manowar's worst songs: Death Tone. This song is just all around bad, the riffs are average, the lyrics are immaturely schizophrenic, if this song was people's introduction to Manowar then it's no wonder so many people hate the band. It certainly isn't a better ode to bikes than Hell Bent For Leather (or Wheels of Fire for that matter). Battle Hymns should have started with either the band's self-titled song or the way I start it, with Metal Daze.\n\nOf course, one can't discuss Battle Hymns without discussing it's glorious title track. This is simply the greatest 7 minutes of Manowar's near 40 year legacy, with Ross The Boss's finest guitar solo and an absurdly high, almost ridiculous vocal performance from Eric Adams in the song's final verse. But there's something else that doesn't get mentioned enough: the songs tempo. Examining the drumbeat in and of itself, it's a 12 bar blues/Quo boogie, but Joey DeMaio's syncopated bass line against it turns the backbeat into a death march shuffling against a Quo boogie. Never mind the stroke of genius in matching the song's lyrics musically, but this is the earliest example I've seen of a tempo that would become quite commonplace not just in power metal, but black and death metal as well. Immortal (Blashrykh), Brutality, Deicide, Enslaved and tons of other extreme metal acts (more extreme than non-extreme surprisingly) have all used the march of the Battle Hymn has a building block for songwriting. Henceforth, whenever I hear this tempo in a metal song it should be referred to as the Manowar march. Given the genre's reputation for swords and sorcery, you'd think more metal bands would have done this, but the only examples I can think of are Iron Maiden's Quest For Fire and The Prophecy. Of course, those songs a) came after this, and b) aren't exactly considered upper tier tracks from that band anyway.\n\nAside from that song and Dark Avenger (structurally resembling the song Black Sabbath; slow doom before erupting into a frenzy), the rest of Battle Hymns are standard early 80s slabs of metal. Fast Taker being the most lethal. Production wise, this album might seem like it suffers from usual first album inexperience, but at least you can easily distinguish what's a guitar and what's a bass on this album, unlike the next two records. The guitar tone is a dirty beast, practically taking a page out of the Fast Eddie book, yet not quite frazzling enough as a band just starting out probably can't afford the biggest stack in the store. The raw tone gives these songs especially the edge they need to kill.\n\nBattle Hymns is a solid, if inconsistent 80s power metal sojourn. Whether or not you will become a Manowarrior as a result of it is more dependent on if you considered mixing Conan the Barbarian with Vietnam shell shock the equivalent of putting pineapples on pizza. If you love your 80s metal raw and somewhat produced, you'll dig this.\n",
        "\nI knew how important \"Fighting The World\" was to power metal before I listened to it, so therefore, I felt honored to do so. Now, as much of a power metal fanboy I can be, \"Fighting The World\" can be silly at times, but the skill displayed and the talent shown is undeniable. Ross \"The Boss\" Friedman is one of my favorite guitarists ever, and some of his best solos come from here.\n\nI really liked the choice of techniques chosen for the guitar solos. One that comes to mind is in the song \"Fighting The World\" when Ross does these quick descending legato scales many times (sounded like B minor to me; Ross started on G on the 15th fret then went down some ways from there) somewhere around the middle of the solo. Blazing stuff like that is what makes this album attention grabbing and enticing. \n\n\"Fighting The World\" is probably what got metal music lovers to unite and be like a brotherhood. This album pretty much calls for that everywhere in here, most notably in \"Holy War\". I won't lie, I almost cried tears because it was so awesome. It only strengthened my love and loyalty to metal. Manowar recognized the widespread media criticism of metal and called on all metal lovers to act like a giant brotherhood, and boy it probably helped heavy metal survive today.\n\nEric Adams' vocal power on \"Fighting The World\" is insane. Maybe there was a little too much in some places, but I liked it and it had its place in the songs. Sometimes, I felt like the vocals was on 'overload' and it can make the songs hard to listen to. Example that comes to mind off this album is \"Blow Your Speakers\". I'm sure you will know what I mean if you listen to it.\n\nIn closing, I am honored to have listened to this album. Manowar may as well have been the most talented and skilled band back in the 80's and they are still up on that list today. I would list \"Fighting The World\" as one the most important power metal albums of all time and would put on my essential power metal albums list.\n",
        "\nI listened to this album the other day, and decided to drop a few lines here since it was through this \u201cboisterous\u201d effort that I got introduced to the trve metal warriors. Until 1987 Manowar were a pretty obscure entity in Bulgaria, and when this friend of mine started salivating over them one day, I didn\u2019t have very high hopes about their musical output; I don\u2019t know why\u2026 I guess it was the stupid clich\u00e9 (\u201ctrue metallers of steel\u201d, or some shit like that) he used to introduce them which automatically made me suspicious. And when I heard \u201cCarry On\u201d which he so proudly played, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing, both within and without; was this supposed to be it, the true metal of steel, this poppy crowd-pleasing energizer!?\n\nI didn\u2019t have time to listen to anything else from the album save for this track on that day, and it was three weeks later when I had the chance to savour the album in its entirety. On the other side of the cassette that was given me there was \u201cHail to England\u201d recorded so I had a fairly good opportunity to get acquainted with the band and their musical \u201cbelligerence\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m sure the band fans must have been somewhat disappointed to hear this opus, but for someone discovering the band through the album reviewed here, it wasn\u2019t such a bad starting point at all. It was obvious that our favourite metal defenders were well aware of the ongoing trends on the scene at the time, and some compromises with their epic, battle-like power metal repertoire had to be made if they wanted to stay afloat. I doubt the guys had any problems in the box-office department, they had accumulated an army of loyal fans by 1987; it\u2019s just that it was trendy to follow the vogues\u2026 and Manowar followed, too. In other words, they had to choose whether to embrace the poppy, radio-friendly trajectory led by Motley Crue and Twisted Sister, or to merge with the growing thrash metal hordes, another commercially viable option. The US power metal movement was melting swiftly in the late-80\u2019s, surviving only in league with the progressive (Fates Warning, Crimson Glory, Savatage), and it almost seemed as though it might as well disappear from the music map had its most faithful advocates voted to abandon it.\n\nFortunately, this is not exactly the case here, but the musical adjustments made are quite audible, even for the less trained ears, and they have been placed at the beginning, intentionally or not. The opening title-track would hardly compel anyone to start fighting for rights, freedom, liberation, legalization of marijuana or whatever cause there may be out there, simply because it\u2019s a friendly radio hit oriented towards the MTV audience. Catchy, memorable and innocently infectious, it can\u2019t possibly displease anyone as it can\u2019t be anything but an isolated experiment; it\u2019s a Manowar album we\u2019re listening to, after all\u2026 yes, but no; \u201cBlow Your Speakers\u201d wouldn\u2019t blow any speakers around the globe as the MTV infatuation carries on on full throttle, its mainstream potential enhanced by the video accompanying it; catchiness at its most plastic the men of war chasing Def Leppard and Motley Crue with fierce determination, with \u201cCarry On\u201d adding more to the cheese... sorry, chase despite its more dynamic and marginally more aggressive nature.\n\nAnd this is where the flirtation with the trends on the field is over; there was no way the Manowars would have produced a whole truckload of cheese. The fans pack up their anxieties after \u201cViolence & Bloodshed\u201d, a major crusher with angry venomous Eric Adams behind the mike, the guys restoring all past glory with the bludgeoning, \u201cviolent\u201d riffage and the apocalyptic, screamy leads. Comes \u201cDefender\u201d, an excellent ballad with Orson Wells (R.I.P.)\u2019s awe-inspiring narrative inaugurating arguably the band\u2019s most popular song, a poignant epic anthem that stands relevant and proud even today, some thirty years later. What follows is probably the band\u2019s finest achievement, \u201cHoly War\u201d & \u201cBlack Wind, Fire & Steel\u201d, a most tantalizing duo, stitched together, constituting some of the greatest 10-min in metal history, pure speed and mayhem with gorgeous epic embellishments, both numbers so finely complementing each other that I can\u2019t think right now of another finishing duo as finely executed and as immaculately bound. A truly honourable nod to the other fashionable vogue at the time, the speed metal movement, done intentionally, I guess, to balance things on this diverse, highly entertaining roller-coaster. \n\nIt\u2019s very good music all over, especially for someone who had no idea about the earlier \u201cbattle hymns\u201d and \u201csigns of the hammer\u201d, but even with the awareness of those previous exploits, I don\u2019t see too many reasons why one should frown too much here. Yes, the beginning is mellow and inviting, but it\u2019s nothing like the overt radio-friendliness of Judas\u2019 \u201cTurbo\u201d and Accept\u2019s \u201cEat the Heat\u201d, for example. The guys were just teasing their fans\u2019 showing them how adaptable they were without going too far down the pop metal road, largely compensating for whatever staggerings they\u2019d made in this direction with the brilliant 10-min showdown at the end. A cross over a few influences was achieved here, one that suited the band, and one that was almost as successfully carried on\u2026 sorry, out on the next instalment (just remember the speed/thrashing fury \u201cWheels of Fire\u201d). Manowar were the metal fanbase\u2019s favourites mostly because they never really betrayed their roots, and continued churning their rowdy power metal anthems as their only more experimental period from their career was the late-80\u2019s. They never succumbed to any particular vogue, and stood the course of the true metal warrior even if that meant to fight against the whole untrve world and blow the posers\u2019 speakers left and right.\n",
        "\nThis is a pretty odd old thing. Stating the bleeding obvious here, but Manowar tend to either absolute fucken nail it- the entire first album for example, or they're completely awful, like Fighting the World or Louder than Hell or Lord of Steel or the Battle Hymns remake or the other remake or etc etc etc. Anyway, turns out on DVD format it's the same thing but magnified about a thousand fold. \n\nThroughout this live set, Manowar are either unbeatable or unwatchable, and they swing between the two with manic enthusiasm. One would have to be dead inside to not lose it when Manowar drop a supremely energetic Metal Daze/Dark Avenger back to back midway through the set, and likewise, surely even the most desperate eastern European metalhead would find it hard pressed to enjoy rubbish mid-era dross like Outlaw, the \"bad hard rock but with lyrics about metal\" of Metal Warriors, or to sit through one of DeMaio's rants, so on and so forth. \n\nIt's a pretty interesting watch this DVD- I don't mean the quality of the tunes, necessarily, just that it lends itself well to a whole bunch of vaguely autistic Manowar analysis. Certainly, it's hard not to feel a lot of regret that Ross the Boss left, as his rawer, sloppier approach to guitar is light years more entertaining than Logan's dry, mechanical, far-too-precise approach, and his tone is light years ahead as well. Joey has a really weird stage presence, the shittiest looking bass ever made, but is undeniably super necessary for the band. He's kinda like Lars Ulrich in that yeah, maybe he sucks a bit but he's as important to Manowar as Lars' kinda shit drumming is for Metallica. Battle Hymns with every ex Manowar guy on stage- a massive success, a surprisingly tight take on a classic... A masturbatory, vaguely lame take on a tune whereby 10 50-odd dads stand onstage and do a bunch of \"dads living their wet dreams\" dad things? Well, can it be both?\n\nAnd that's the kicker I guess, because it kinda is both, but if you're not a cynical asshole you'll get a lot out of this. That's the gist of it really- are you a the kind of person that likes Radiohead and thinks too much about coffee, or are you a man of culture, and thus a Manowar fan? Call to Arms is, instrumentally, extremely boring, but with Adams' forceful, enthusiastic vocals and the band clearly enjoying themselves immensely it's impossible to deny. Hail and Kill is just immense heavy metal- most bands would kill to write a single song as good; Manowar have done maybe 10? and most of them are here at full force. The aforementioned Battle Hymns is brilliantly over the top and the long, super super drawn out coda would've been fantastic live, Blood of My Enemies etc etc etc.\n\nIt feel like it would serious effort for anyone - literally, anyone- to insist that they don't like any of this. There's a few utterly fantastic tunes, the whole band is in pretty good shape, the sound production is pretty killer, and whoever shot it did in a nicely over the top way that fits the music perfectly. Just skip whenever DeMaio talks and when they get the orchestra out. Easy! All up well worth anyone's time.\n",
        "\nBeing fairly sympathetic to Manowar and all that, I came in with fairly high expectations of this album; Warriors of the World had some really great tunes and I saw no real reason as to why anything would be terribly different here. Maybe less of the vision and youthful excitement the early albums had, perhaps, but with great vocals and engaging enough instrument work to keep things ticking over. Now I could quite easily close this review with a WRONG, THIS IS JUST BAD HARD ROCK, and that would be perfectly adequate, but I guess I oughta do some description, so here goes.\n\nLet's examine the hard rock first. Now, I'm not one who's particularly qualified on the fine line between heavy metal and hard rock, but I think one fairly good notifier (in many, but not all cases!) is the way the guitar goes about it's thing. There's exceptions, of course, but whereas, say, For Whom the Bell Tolls, or Hail and Kill have riffs, this album has chord progressions. Sure, they're heavily distorted, but the fact remains this album has as many riffs as Bon Jovi. Devoid of interesting little motifs that heavy metal tends to have, the guitars are reduced to an utterly subservient role- chugging along in support of the vocals, with a fairly weak, thin tone and nothing else. There's just some real irony to the idea that an album with 3 songs all about heavy metal is not infact heavy metal.\n\nAnd now onto the bad. Well, simple hard rock isn't a bad thing- I'm right into acca dacca, and have no real problem with competent rockin stuff from earlier times. But here's not a good example of how to do it. The songs tend to sound extremely similar; mid tempo plodders with an often underwhelming chorus, same structures, trite lyrics, no real excitement, just a bad movie soundtrack that plays when some dudes ride by on bikes, sorry, horses of steel. I would tend to compare it to Back in Black, which for all it's simplicity changed things up enough throughout songs to keep you engaged- thrilled, even. Not so here. Power, Warlord, Brothers of Metal, Gods made- well, the last tune has a pretty ripping chorus but there's nothing else to really seperate those tunes. It's kinda a bummer that the one track where something genuinely different is tried- A good day to die- quickly loses steam and becomes a very boring, very long instrumental, where a bit of ambition and focus could've seen some vocals and riffs added, and a heavy metal epic born.\n\nYeah, I just have no idea why anyone would be into this. It's very similar to a lot of other Manowar, just nowhere near as good. \"Steel\" and \"metal\" consist of perhaps 99% of the lyrics. There's no riffs. Adams sounds far more inspired elsewhere. There's a few elements- the production, the vocals, where things could be described as \"competent\" but the rest is just super painful.\n",
        "\nWriting about \u201cInto Glory Ride\u201d is such a hard task; I\u2019ve listened to it many times before getting to a conclusion. There are three factors that explain its lack of receptivity.\n\nFirst one is the least, and it\u2019s directly thrown into your face as soon as you get the album. It doesn\u2019t compromise the quality of the songs, but the laughable presentation of its inexcusable cover and the title keep you wondering, pessimistically, about what to expect. Since this was the second release of the band, no one knew their faces or how they physically were; so when the cover is seen, the first question that pops to your mind is: \u201cWho are these fucking idiots dressed as RPG fans (in a kindergarten level, by the way)?\u201d Seriously, was this the best way to make their faces known? And the background of the cover is also atrocious. This cover exhales amateurism. Besides, \u201cInto Glory Ride\u201d is such an imbecile title; even nowadays, after hearing the whole discography and aware of the lyrical territory that Manowar explored throughout, I still find this title ridiculous. \n\nNext one is the style. It is so different from its predecessor, actually from every Manowar album! The songs are neither direct as in \u201cBattle Hymns\u201d nor developed with the band\u2019s signature atmosphere and structure of the forthcoming releases. Except for \u2018Warlord\u2019, the tracks are much slower, longer and heavier than the Kings of Metal\u2019s standards, kind of conducted in a progressive way. This progression has led to hits and misses throughout the album.\n\nThe last and most important factor is what this album is all about: inconsistency. More highs and lows than a roller coaster. The problem is: there is a bunch of ideas; much more than necessary. It is clear there was not a criterion of selection whatsoever; they were obviously careless about the quality of their brainstorm process. As the result, anything goes. From brilliant galloping riffs to twenty seconds of a teenager moaning in pleasure. This constant alternation safeguards any analysis as viable.\n\nWhat amuses me about it is that this inconsistency is not only verified in a track-by-track analysis. No! You can verify it by reviewing the songs individually! Take \u2018Gloves of Metal\u2019: despite the pathetic lyrics, it is a great song; until you reach the mistaken riff of the bridge section, which just spotlights the bad production. The promising \u2018Warlord\u2019: great main riff (in an Iron Maiden style), but the chorus is incredibly lazy (a perfect and rare example of a song that is ruined by the lyrics). In \u2018March for Revenge\u2019, the problem is the length and the pushed intention of delivering the last tune as a long epic, therefore we have a rhythm break section with a boring narration.\n\nSadly, I can go all day long pointing every little mistake arising from the poor idea selection.\n\nThe only song that is a 100% consistent is \u2018Hatred\u2019\u2026 but consistent in sucking ass! Everything is utterly bad! The main \u2018riff\u2019 is tedious and way too slow (in my first impression, I thought that it would be used for a narration that introduces the song - like in the beginning of \u2018Gates of Valhalla\u2019), but after the ungodly riff of the chorus I was hoping the main riff to be brought back! I just can\u2019t describe how horrendous the chorus is, it\u2019s like something in a psychedelic rock style, but way too corny and out of place. The lyrics are cheesy, mostly in the chorus, and the impression is that they were made by extempore. And, when you think that it couldn\u2019t be any worse, the first chorus ends and the total profanity begins with a godawful section with space noises. That\u2019s right: space fucking noises! That is the worst musical resource I have ever heard in heavy metal! It seems that there was not a post-production whatsoever, it is impossible to imagine that somebody heard the song and found out that this noise was OK. Taking apart the narrations and pathetic bass instrumental tracks, \u2018Hatred\u2019 stands out as one of the worst Manowar songs ever! I am dead serious!\n\nThe other constant is the songwriting, which is unbelievably bad! A major step back from \u2018Battle Hymns\u2019. You can\u2019t be any dumber than \u201cGloves of Metal rule tonight\u201d or \u201cBlack is the forest, white was the snow\u201d. And the bad taste is back again, full fucking force: \u201cMaim and Kill them, take the women and children\u201d. Just as said before, these examples could go on and on. And how many fucking times the word \u201cride\u201d is spoken? Goddamn! This passion for \u201crides\u201d is so idiotic! I think, excluding \u201ckill\u201d, \u201cride\u201d is the most spoken word of the band\u2019s lyrics.\n\nNotwithstanding, there are some good songs. Among the galloping epic style: \u2018Gates of Valhalla\u2019 is awesome (the intro could be smaller though), \u2018Revelation\u2019 is one of my favorites (the lyrics are slightly better than the rest) and \u2018March for Revenge\u2019 is the weakest of the trio, but still a good song. Other than that, \u2018Secret of Steel\u2019 with its Black Sabbath\u2019s rhythm also stands out. \n\nIn the end: a mixed result. The album had so much potential, but ended up being spotted by bad choices and ideas. They could have improved and treated the songs with more care and, of course, abandoned \u2018Hatred\u2019 (this one was hopeless since the beginning) in favor of another song (or narration, bass shredding, farts solos, anything!). The result would be much better and we could have a worthy successor to \u2018Battle Hymns\u2019, what was not the case\u2026\n",
        "\nManowar\u2019s third album and so proclaimed as one of the best of their discography. I can see why but I disagree. Summarizing, my analysis relies on the fact that you must see the album in its completeness, and in my opinion \u201cHail to England\u201d fails.\n\nFirst of all, the production of the album is not that great. You can hear some estrange microphone noises, buzzes and guitar/bass detuning (egregious in the last two tunes). Nevertheless, it is not terrible and it\u2019s perfectly ignorable (again, apart from the last two songs); this doesn\u2019t ruin the album.\n\nSecond of all, the songwriting is among the Manowar\u2019s theme standards but it is overall poorly executed (except in \u201cArmy of Immortals\u201d). Some verses like: \u201cImpale me in the horns of death\u201d (\u201cBridge of Death\u201d) and \u201cI rape the priestess on pagan\u2019s night\u201d (\u201cEach Dawn I Die\u201d) can\u2019t go unscathed. Besides that, there is the atrocious lyrics of \u201cBlack Arrows\u201d, one of the most pathetic I\u2019ve ever seen in heavy metal music, just pitiful. But this is Manowar\u2019s lyrics and you are not expecting Shakespeare. I believe the majority of the songs are not compromised (except for the, attaboy, the last two songs).\n\nThat been said, let\u2019s check the tunes themselves. This album possesses two masterpieces: \u201cBlood of My Enemies\u201d with its great guitar lines and astonishing vocal performance and the extremely fast and powerful \u201cKill with Power\u201d where everything works in a brilliant way from the drumming to another Adams\u2019 irreproachable display of his powerful and captivating voice (best music of the album and one of my personal favorites among their discography). \u201cArmy of Immortals\u201d is a beautiful and catchy song, album\u2019s homonymous is kind repetitive and \u201cEach Dawn I Die\u201d is interestingly good due to the bass lines. So where\u2019s the problem?\n\nThe problem is the last two songs. Hail to England goes downhill with the abomination in form of music called \u201cBlack Arrows\u201d. Besides, the aforementioned lyrics you can\u2019t say that this is a solo. There\u2019s no harmony at all, is just a bunch of chords played in the fastest way possible, this doesn\u2019t make a good song. The bass sounds like a dentist drill, is very irritating (listening to it using earphones is a task that even Odin would give up). An unacceptable filler that can\u2019t go unnoticed.\n\n\u201cBridge of Death\u201d is the last and it fails enormously in the attempt of being epic. Despite the awesome intro, the main riff is as lazy as it can be and the outro is awful with a major guitar detuning and Christmas\u2019 bells noise (???). The initiative of changing the lyrics thematic is praiseworthy, but the execution is laughable. You can\u2019t make a music that speaks about an encounter with Satan with so lenient lyrics, it doesn\u2019t fit with the magniloquent atmosphere ambition of the song (they tried, but couldn\u2019t). The narrated part is horrendous; it\u2019s hard to imagine that those verses were released. I can\u2019t see why this tune is treated like \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d (from Iron Maiden), maybe the Satan factor transforms it into a classic epic for some. The truth: this \u201cepic\u201d song is just an extremely and long boredom.\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019d say that \u201cHail to England\u201d could be one of the best Manowar\u2019s album, but it\u2019s is killed by the inexcusable \u201cBlack Arrows\u201d and the lazy \u201cBridge of Death\u201d. These two last songs represents around 35% of the album\u2019s time, that\u2019s why, in a very short album, those can\u2019t be ignored.\n",
        "\nCompilations like this one are really no more than a snare for the unwary traveller, but The Hell of Steel somehow manages to defy its origins to serve as a fairly decent route in to the wacky world of Manowar. I'd imagine the band's antipathy towards the album's existence probably stems more from financial disagreements with Atlantic rather than serious professional pride, but it's definitely a bit naughty calling what at times seems like a random collection of songs from a mid-career three album stretch \"the best of\" anything. The track selection is definitely a little iffy, and while most of the big hitters of the era are all present and correct, a couple of baffling choices make you wonder whether the person at Atlantic responsible was either unsuited for the task of picking a Manowar best of, or was just taking the piss a little.\n\nBut while The Hell of Steel doesn't serve as anything like a proper representation of Manowar's overall sound (either the ultra-manly early stuff or the more divisive Karl Logan era that was still only on the horizon at this point), it does manage to encapsulate where the band were in the late 80s and early 90s rather succinctly. This was the time when Manowar really went for it in terms of big production values (very much of their time) and booming crowd-pleasing anthems at the expense of a lot of the rawness and muscular musicianship of their formative years. They rightly catch some flak for this, and to many more casual listeners (or detractors) this sound is often seen as all Manowar were ever about. Leaving that aside though, there's no denying this part of Manowar's history turned out some genuine classics, and for all its faults, this compilation manages to capture that trademark mix of camp and outright metal majesty quite nicely. With that being said, only the Fighting the World tracks truly suffer from the buttery digital recording technique, with Kings of Metal a step back in the right back direction and The Triumph of Steel being no less than a masterclass in production values and musicianship as the band eased away from their commercial flirtations again. Another thing to keep in mind is that while the production was less raw on these albums and Joey DeMaio reigned in his completely over-the-top bass playing technique quite considerably, Eric Adams' leonine vocals remained as forceful and emotive as ever, benefiting in some cases from being at the undisputed forefront of many of the songs.\n\nThe Hell of Steel was in fact my own personal introduction to Manowar, and while I naturally had a lot to learn, it's fair to say that it left a pretty big impression on me even if it did take a little while for it to work its charms. The order the tracks appear in probably had something to do with that, as 20 year old Radagast definitely took himself a great deal more seriously than his older, fatter counterpart does. I can still remember sitting in the pub with my friend the day he bought the album (my CD-R copy yet to be burned) and the two of us - one headphone each - having a laugh at how the first two songs were both about the amount of ass the band performing them kicked.\n\nIn a strange sort of way, The Hell of Steel actually rolls sort of like a big, flabby, extended version of an early 80s (all right, classic era) Manowar album, as all the simpler, rocking songs appear in the first half while the metal scorchers mostly appear in the second. The lopsided pacing is serendipitously quite representative of all three major label Manowar albums, and it takes a while for things to really take flight. It starts with the sharp one-two with the title tracks from Fighting the World and Kings of Metal, but then comes a nearly eight-minute song that just sort of trudges along for the first six or seven, then a hilariously bad spoken work track followed by a big ballad, which is in turn followed by an even bigger ballad. Not exactly setting the heather alight, and trying to fathom what The Warrior's Prayer is even doing here could drive a person to madness.\n\nThe Demon's Whip is the aforementioned trudger, an otherwise largely forgotten number from The Triumph of Steel that is here at the expense of a couple of better songs from the same album. One thing it does offer though is maybe the fastest and most intense playing Manowar have ever delivered once it finally bursts into life. The classic Manowar line-up will, correctly, always be seen as Eric-Joey-Ross-Scott, but in terms of pure musicianship, the work done on The Triumph of Steel with David Shankle and Rhino was at times breathtaking.\n\nDefender is the first of those two ballads, and is probably the song where Manowar finally clicked for me all those years ago. I'd transitioned from awkward role-playing teenager into awkward David Gemmell book reading university student quite handily around that time, and the epic fantasy vibe of this song really swept me away. In a way, it is Manowar defined; I mean, it is undoubtedly completely ridiculous - the vocal delivery is camp, and the narration (by Orson fucking Welles, don't forget) riotously overwrought, yet somehow at the same time the song is both emotional and awe-inspiring. If something could ever be both the most stupid and also the best thing you've ever heard, it would probably be Manowar, and Defender would be one of the most compelling pieces of evidence at that particular trial.\n\nSo it's been an admittedly bumpy ride so far, and after the majesty of The Crown and the Ring (I won't start burning through the songs one at time, but let's just say a church choir and organ ballad is a pretty fucking audacious move) we hit quite a deep pothole with the rather tragic Blow Your Speakers. Make no mistake, Manowar always wrote rock songs. Pretty much the whole first side of their debut album is such, but while in their early years the songs were overblown, testosterone-pumped hangovers from 1970s New York, Blow Your Speakers is just a goofy, clueless attempt to get on the radio. The lyrics, intended as an ironic put-down of MTV culture, just end up coming back around again and sounding like a sad, angry plea to be loved that probably went on to birth a thousand YouTube comments about how people should be listening to REAL MUSIC.\n\nBut hey, we're past the rough patch now, and onto all the true metal we were promised earlier on the songs with big booming disco drums. Indeed, you'd be lucky to ever hear such a perfect metal trifecta as Black Wind, Fire and Steel followed by Hail and Kill and then The Power of Thy Sword anywhere else. The former two get a lot of plaudits for being among the best songs Manowar have ever done, and quite rightly so, but I think the latter is really unfairly overlooked. Brewing a stunning atmosphere, the solos are Shankle at his very best, and the overlapping vocals on the concluding choruses are just absurdly brilliant.\n\nMore ballads! And not just any bloody ballads either. It's probably just for the sake of boosting the album's collectability that the record company decided to throw the German version of Heart of Steel on here (as result it was the version I was most familiar with for quite a few years), but it is no less brimming with sorrow and wonder than the original. It must be to the song's credit that even with the lyrics rendered largely incomprehensible that it remains so inspiring and evocative. This and the soothing acoustic closer Master of the Wind really show how Manowar could strip back the strutting and masculinity (but thankfully not the glorious homoeroticism) to make music that was just beautiful on its own terms and required no degree of self-awareness to enjoy to its fullest.\n\nWant to hear a charming anecdote about the song Kings of Metal? Sure you do. It was on what used to be the annual pilgrimage to the Sweden Rock Festival, on the train to S\u00f6lvesborg, where myself and a couple of others were listening to the song on a pair of speakers, singing along at a decent volume and having a drink while we were at it. Freaking those squares out, in other words. So of course we had just hit the immortal line \"we won't turn down for anyone, we do just what we please!\" when a conductor asked in a polite but firm voice if we would turn the speakers down, and was met with profuse apologies and immediate compliance. I've led a drunken choir through the streets of Birmingham on the way to a Manowar show, but I think believing that I was cool as fuck only to swiftly be reminded that I absolutely wasn't is probably the Manowarriest moment of my life.\n\nAnd I've got The Hell of Steel to thank for it. It's uneven, it's far detached from the more exuberant early days of the band and it's motivated purely by money...in other words, it's Manowar. It may not be a perfect representation of the Metal Kings' overall body of work, but it gives a fair enough idea of the kind of shenanigans you'd be letting yourself in for, and is a largely brilliant collection of individual songs in any case.\n\nAnd if anyone ever figures out what the hell is going on in that album cover, please drop me a line.\n",
        "\nThrough the years I've come to notice that there are basically three ingredients that constitute a good Manowar release: Simplicity, heaviness and heart. \"Gods of War\" (2007) had the latter two, but was dragged out by dull spoken parts on almost every track and missed the mark on its epic ambitions. Fans reacted, Manowar responded, and now the simplicity is back in the game. And it\u2019s back with a fu**ing vengeance!\n\n\u201cThe Lord of Steel\u201d is perhaps not as catchy as we\u2019re used to when Manowar hits the stage, but it still contains the hooks that stick to your brain almost forcing you to sing along. It\u2019s also the most simplistic and heavy album the American quartet has produced since \u201cSign of the Hammer\u201d (1984). It\u2019s all about making heavy metal, everything else is left aside. This takes us to the third ingredient: Heart. No matter what the haters may tell you, Manowar is a band that believes in what they do and this has never been clearer. The tunes on \u201cThe Lords of Steel\u201d come directly from their hearts and speak directly to mine. With a step back from their recent epic intentions it seems the songwriting itself has been given the proper attention. Throughout the album we are served tasty traditional Manowar riffing and strong choruses. The opening title track sets the bar high with mighty guitar slides and straight forward drumming. It's obvious from the start that the Americans are aiming for a heavy approach. Eric Adams, who makes one of his best performances in years, is absolutely fierce with his angry harsh vocals, the guitar solos are kept at a minimum (Karl Logan gets his time to shine, however, with a lot of prominent lead guitar playing) and the tempo is adjusted to perfectly suit clenched fists raised to the sky moving along with the rhythm. The whole concept comes together perfectly in the albums best effort, \u201cTouch the Sky\u201d. The mighty riffing combined with the pompous chorus leaves a simplistic yet bombastic tune which I'm sure will be a part of the live performances for many years to come.\n\nHowever, there\u2019re a few things I think should\u2019ve been done differently. First of all, in the ambition to create an over the top heavy album, a strange noisy sound sometimes accompanies the guitars. Secondly, it would have been nice with some more high pitched screams from Eric Adams (like in, for example, \u201cAnnihilation\u201d). Thirdly, and last, I miss that one true hit that\u2019s always on a Manowar album. I understand that this is supposed to be, \u201cEl Gringo\u201d, but this is actually one of the weakest tracks on the release in my opinion.\n\nIn the end, Manowar has made a simple and heavy album impregnated with loads and loads of heart. It\u2019s not perfect, but Manowar has never been about perfection, it has always been about making awesome heavy metal, and in that aspect \u201cThe Lord of Steel\u201d is a success!\n",
        "\nIt remains a mystery why Manowar chose to rerecord two albums which already had good sound quality \u2013 Battle Hymns and Kings of Metal. Their second, third and fourth album (Into Glory Ride, Hail to England and Sign of the Hammer respectively) are all classics too, and the audio quality was considerably worse on those than on Battle Hymns and Kings of Metal. A reasonable guess is that Hymns and Kings are two of the most popular and the most commercial, thereby making new tours featuring the numbers from those albums more viable vehicles for an improved Manowar credit rating. In any case, we now have a rerecorded version of Kings of Metal. The burning question is: is it any good?\n\nIn some ways they are digging their own grave, by making it seem as if they are a band long beyond their days of glory, having to rely on older material to rouse the metal world again \u2013 but then again, that is the truth, is it not? The honesty is appreciated! \n\nLook, there are very ugly things to be found on this record, and there's no shame in pointing them out. The guitars were tuned down; why, I do not know. The \"brightness\" of the original is lost. Manowar's playing was always tight, but this time it's so pitch perfect on every note that it feels mechanical. It feels as if the songs are played slower, though running time indicates otherwise. The vitality is gone; these are rehashed, and you can feel it. \n\nHail and Kill opens the album now, and that was a bad decision. The rerecording is soulless \u2013 there's no energy to it. Is it Eric's reduced vocal power? Is it the tuned down guitars? Is it the less brutal chorus? (How is that possible, by the way? Where is the devious \"HAIL, HAIL, HAIL AND KILL\" chant we were used to?) Whatever it is, there's no fire left. The same goes for On Wheels of Fire, but the reason there is clear: the backing vocals and effects used in the chorus are no longer there, making the chorus a little weak. The chorus is the centerpiece of the song, containing the furious riffing and fast singing by providing some footing. With that so powerless, the whole song falls flat. A real shame.\n\nI will assume they had the best intentions, however, and with that in mind, there are a few positives. First, Eric Adams still kills. The man's a God and always will be. He hits high notes he shouldn't be hitting at all at his age, even if he is no longer the youthful deity he once was. He transitioned from Zeus into Cronos, and that is nothing to be ashamed of. He gives it his all, and I have nothing but praise for the vocal performance, even if it may have been better in the past.\n\nSecond, the hilarious A Warrior's Prayer was rerecorded with renowned actor Brian Blessed, and he hams it up so bad I crack up nearly every time. \"Who were they? They were the kings of METAAAAAAAAL!\" The original was a little too flat for an over-the-top Manowar intro; that has been fixed this time. It's actually fun to listen to this time, and I've never skipped it once while going through the CD. \n\nBy the way, every player in Manowar is still amazing. Say what you want about DeMaio, but his bass playing is always top-notch, first-rate, jaw-droppingly good; Karl Logan still gives us great solos, and plays the old Ross \"the Boss\" riffs well; and Donnie Hamzik remains a great drummer. DeMaio even made his bass solo slightly less dull by adding a loud metronome, just to show how great he is. The inadvertent comedy makes the track far more fun. \n\nThere still remains one huge reason you should consider getting this album: The Heart of Steel MMXIV. With lots of flashy effects, and without a poorly recorded piano (using an acoustic guitar and orchestral effects this time), this new version would be as good as the original. But there's something else very special: Eric Adams gives it his all, and he does it so well, that I \u2013 I will say it, prepare yourself! \u2013 prefer this version to the original. Such passion! Speaking of Heart of Steel, there's one more reason I hardly dislike this album: the second CD. The second disc contains instrumental versions of all songs. If you are like me, the first thing that comes to mind is: Manowar karaoke! Bring over some friends, bring it to class, sing by yourself in the privacy of your room (and the adjacent rooms of neighbors). and enjoy Manowar! Now you too can sing about your great Heart of Steel! (Do make sure your girlfriend isn't nearby.) \n\nI dare say the rerecorded version of The Crown and the Ring is better too: this time, the organ actually sounds somewhat real. The sound effects are of higher quality as well, and Eric Adams is, as always, still Eric Adams. Such a grandiose song actually benefits hugely from the improved sound quality. There are even two versions: one \u201cmetal\u201d version, and one \u201corchestral\u201d version. The diversity and attention to detail is much appreciated. DeMaio spend a lot of time mixing the album, and the sound effects are of correspondingly high quality. He did a fine job.\n\nThis is a decent effort, but it's an effort that never should have been made. For what it's worth, it's all right, and even very good in places. Better enjoy what we have. And let's not forget: there's Manowar karaoke!\n",
        "\n\u201cHaving conquered the world time and again since the band\u2019s inception, what\u2019s left for these warriors, these kings, to prove? What is the possible impetus for the band to forge ahead?\u201c\n\nThis quote is part of pretty egocentric rant that is on the official Manowar site for some time now, and that probably should be changed by now. Maybe I\u2019m old-fashioned, but this sounds very, very corny. The band itself claims that it is so true that others are not worthy of kissing their feet, but then they re-release the album on its twenty-sixth anniversary. Am I missing something or is it a new fashion with true metalheads?\n\nGenerally, I do not mind the occasional re-releasing of classic albums, preferably on round anniversary, like 30 years or something, but that\u2019s not the case here. But, as I found out while writing this, apparently the album was supposed to be released last year, which would have been round 25 years, but for some reason it didn\u2019t, so we are stuck to these moronic 26 years. It\u2019s not that big of a deal, but come on, just four more years and it would be nice round number\u2026\n\nWell, enough about years. Who thinks that this is a miserable attempt of robbery, will not buy the album. Like most folks that bought the original. And those who do not give a fuck.\n\nBut, now I\u2019m going to write something that I never believed it would go from my keyboard to empty white space on my screen: This actually sounds good! And not just the songs themselves, I think the overall impression. The difference from the original is sufficient that this can be considered a legitimate, justified re-issue! Of course, one could make valid complaint about this not having the charm of the original production, and that it might sound waaay more cheesy than the original, but in general the difference is big and noticeable enough to be justified. At least technicalities\u2026\n\nWhat really bothers me are song names. MMXIV in the name of each song is totally unnecessary. Like 7,802,368 THY-s, THE-s and similar gibberish. What the fuck? Is this supposed to sound epic? Well, it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s ridiculous and totally uncalled for. Like aforementioned MMXIV.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, though, I enjoyed the album. Not being great fan of the original, it was nice to hear it again, as a reminder. Songs remained pretty much unchanged, except for far superior production. So if you were afraid that the songs are drastically altered \u2013 don\u2019t be. Apart from tiny variations, loads of orchestral versions and an additional CD with more orchestral versions, this is still good old Kings Of Metal. So, if you don\u2019t believe this is good old cash-grab, go and buy it! Others\u2026 well, if you didn\u2019t care about Manowar before, you sure as hell won\u2019t give a damn about them now.\n\nIn the end, I hope they won\u2019t release all of their albums this way. With Kings Of Metal being heavy metal classic, this stretched attempt to \u201cimprove\u201d it can sure as fuck partly be characterized as cash-grab, but also partly as reasonable (and needed) re-issue. Bear in mind, though, that this is second album (after Battle Hymns) re-issued in this way. The only question is: how far will they go?\n",
        "\nThe Lord of Steel...mmm....perhaps the most polarising album in this legendary band's entire discography. Upon the first listen, I have to admit feeling pretty underwhelmed. TLOS seemed to hearken back to earlier albums such as Fighting the World or perhaps the first side of Battle Hymns. A kind of stripped-down, to-the-metal honest-to-goodness direct approach replaced what we had come to expect from Manowar over the last several years. To be honest, I just don't get the vitriol leveled at this recording. \n\nAfter the initial feeling of disappointment and after several spins, this album started to grow on me. Okay, there is that bass sound that has caused so much consternation from fans. \nI've got to say, it never bothered me at all. Yes, there is a perpetual buzz that almost threatens to overpower everything else on the album, but there is something in that rich, heavy, droning 'bzzzzzz' that I like. It sounds especially good on Black List (which is my personal favourite track on the album). Rather than an annoying house fly, it is more akin to the thudding drone of those giant Asian killer hornets. It's an acquired taste, though. No denying that. \n\nAnother thing that struck me is that, in my opinion, there is no filler track or tracks on the album. On pretty much every Manowar album, there is at least one (and oftentimes more than one) track that, after a few listens, one tends to skip and never come back to. I can't say that this is the case here. \n\nThe ten tracks on offer are remarkably consistent in making the listener break out into spontaneous headbanging or playing air guitar. You can't help it. I would imagine tracks like Expendable, Manowarriors, El Gringo, and Annihilation would work brilliantly at a live concert. Even the rather...um...derivative Hail, Kill and Die (admittedly a poor man's Blood of the Kings) is not a bad song once you get around the song title. Contrast this with Gods of War, which offered surprisingly few actual songs, and Warriors of the World, which although containing some absolute belters, had one or two iffy songs on it as well. This album is much more consistent and cohesive as a whole than either of those two. \n\nAnd here's another thing - for once we have no obvious 'go to' song about Vikings or Viking mythology. In my opinion, that's a good thing. Manowar, great as they have been at that particular theme over the years, have stereotyped themselves with the Viking theme. After God of War, I don't think I could tolerate yet more songs about Thor, Loki, Odin, and the gang. It's been done to death, and not only by Manowar, but by Unleashed, Einherjer, Amon Amarth, and dozens of other bands. It's gotten old and stale, so the fact that Manowar have decided to concentrate on other subject matter (Born in a Grave came out of left field for me) is a welcome change. Long may it continue. \n\nOverall, I think this is a solid offering from Manowar. I would place it in the lower middle order of their discography. It's not a classic like Into Glory Ride, Kings of Metal, or Sign of the Hammer of course, but for my money it's better than Fighting the World or Gods of War. Maybe Warriors of the World, too.\n\nThe songs are energetic, catchy, and eminently listenable and pure heavy metal. What more can I ask for? At this stage in the game, Manowar are not going to bring out another Triumph of Steel, but that's okay. What is one offer on The Lord of Steel is, for my money, perfectly good. Perhaps on the next outing someone can turn Joey's bass down just a tad, but other than that I would be perfectly happy if the band continued in this direction.\n",
        "\nManowar is a special band. There is no metalhead has never heard of them or heard anything by them. They're pretty much a staple band in metal. So, what makes the band so special? They could make epic music with a computer generated lyrics that have the combination of words such as metal, warriors, brothers, kill, blood, war,and glory. Their early albums range from great to enjoyable silliness that works. Then comes... Kings of Metal.\n\nEvery member of Manowar is talented and capable of using the instruments but sometimes, the Manowar cliches along with strange songwriting hinders the music on the album rather makes it exciting. \"Hail and Kill\" is a very recognizable song and pretty much a fun simple song that works and get the album some recognition but once you start listening to the whole album through, you'd notice some stuff that feels so odd and makes you go \"What the FUCK?\"\n\nLet's just say, the album is sort of split into 3 parts. The first part starts of with \"Wheels of Fire\" which is a decent opener starts off with motortcycle engine sort of like the opener of Battle Hymns with Death Tone which we already heard that before and the main comes in with some cunchy riff and the song is on. Honesty, it's an okay song and the chorus is pretty catchy and fun but nothing really spectacular but the verse transition into the chorus is pretty inconsistent which it does not flow well. The second and the title track is next and this is a pretty fun song. It's Manowar over-the-topness but still enjoyably silly and despite the lyrics with \"kick your ass\" in it is somewhat badass and works fine and puts a smile on your face. \"Heart of Steel\" is a nicely piano driven ballad with impressive vocal performance by Eric Adams and a very soothing and well-written song. It's Manowar's better ballads and works fine. But you know, when you read a title like \"Heart of Steel\", you'd expect a very heavy riff filled song but if you're listening to this for the first time, a ballad would just throw you off but eventually, you'd get over it and the song plays nicely and the best track on the album. The first part ends with \"Sting Of The Bumblebee\" which is nothing but Joey DeMaio's bass wankary with drumming interlude. Joey DeMaio is an accomplished bassist but is it really necessary to halt the flow of the album with this? Not really. I, personally, don't like interludes. They just cut off the flow and it does take awhile until the second part kicks in (I'm just saying this generally with a lot of albums not just this one.)\n\nThe second part of the album opens with \"The Crown And The Ring\" which is another softy, huh! Kings of Metal, my ass!!! Look, it's a very nice song with choir, orchestral, and church organs. I, personally, like it but seems very odd having another ballad after a ballad and an interlude. It just makes the whole \"metal\" imagery which the band tried to convey is pretty deceiving and weak. I know, metal is diverse and whatnot but if the tracks between \"Kingdom Come\" and \"The Crown And The Ring\" is switched, it would have been a bit better. It just slows the album between tracks 3 to 5. By the way, \"Kingdom Come\" is forgettable track, isn't it?\n\nAnd now, the first big strike that killed the album with the abomination known as \"Pleasure Slave\". This has to be the worst Manowar song of the 80's. It's even a bonus track and somehow shoved midway of the album. Why not at the end of them album? It wouldn't had a horrible effect later on. So, the song opens up with an orgy Christmas party and the lyrics are just disgustingly terrible. I know, I've heard black metal and death metal songs with more disturbingly weird shit lyrics but this one is just terribly written on top of that. Someone suggested in the earlier reviews that this isn't meant to be taken seriously. Okay, I do agree on that but what makes it worse is that the music is just fucking bad. It's slow, plodding, and annoying sound riff that makes the whole experience so unpleasant. At least, with black and death metal songs, yes, they are not meant to be taken seriously but at least the music is good. Here, it's neither the lyrics or the music. Eric Adams wailing does get fucking annoying with the moaning sounds just fucking kills it. Even on the guitar solo section, the moaning doesn't fucking stop and it is fucking annoying as hell. The song falls into the unfunny and pathetic attempt as a humor. And what makes things worst is that \"Hail and Kill\" is next. \"Pleasure Slave\" effect is still on the back of your mind listening to a great song like \"Hail and Kill\" which makes it feel really bad. So, I think the earlier edition to the album was better because it has \"Kingdom Come\" and after it \"Hail and Kill\" and the flow wouldn't have been butchered by \"Pleasure SUCK!!\". My suggestion either find the older edition or program the CD player or something to skip over this horse-shit of a track.\n\nSo, if \"Pleasure Slave\" was the first strike and then \"The Warrior's Prayer\" demolishes the album into stupidity. This is the third part of the album and it's just a stupid track is about some kid asking his drunk grandfather to tell him a story for FOUR AND TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES INTERLUDE!!! Really??? This is on a Manowar album? And let's be honest, do you even care on what this old fuck rambling around. \"I was a warrior slitting throat with \"hek!\" Peter Pan and we fought giant \"hek!\" robots because we looked \"hek!\" metal and shit like that!\" It's also funny is that the grandfather asks the kid if he liked his insane stupid story. I think the kid just made up his appreciation to him of fear that his grandfather would go more coo-coo on him. Jeez!!! I mean, this track takes out all the seriousness and the \"metaness\" out of the album.\n\nHowever, Blood of the Kings does close the album on a good note after several shitty moments. It's an epic song in which the band has decided to put all the album titles and track titles in their lyrics making silly yet awesome at the same time, the last part of the song which seems a pre-Judas Priest Painkiller moment. It's a great closure to a subpar album.\n\nI think the album would have worked better if it has a different arrangement to the tracks by removing and replacing them around for something like this:\n\n1. Wheels of Fire\n2. Kings of Metal\n3. Heart of Steel\n4. Sting of the Bumblebee\n5. Kingdom Come\n6. Hail and Kill\n7. The Crown And The Ring (Lament Of The Kings)\n8. Blood of the Kings\n\nIn conclusion, it's not Manowar's best album despite having some strong tracks especially in the beginning but declines as it progresses. \"Pleasure Slave\" and \"The Warrior's Prayer\" are the reasons that I gave the album such an average score. Is it worth listening? Yes, it does because it is still a Manowar album but could have been better. Still, Manowar's best albums are from Battle Hymn to Fighting the World and the decline had started from this album.\n",
        "\nSo first off, we have a new guitarist, Karl Logan. Ross the Boss left the band in '89 and was replaced by David Shankle, who left in '94 after playing on \"The Triumph of Steel\". Secondly, Scott Columbus is back in the band on drums. This line-up is in my opinion inferior to Shankle and Rhino for the previous album, but with that being said, I still really love this album, and I'm going to tell you why. \n\nStylistically, this is as straight-forward and as to the point as you can get. Though it's not the most musically adept album in terms of complexity, that is the very thing that makes it so enjoyable and awesome. What you get with this album is pile-driving rhythms, steady, straight forward bass lines, clean and simple, powerful guitar riffs, and most importantly, strong, powerful, and melodic vocals. I would say that this is probably Manowar's greatest \"sing along\" album, because the vocals are the forefront of every track. The first 3 songs are all in generally the same vein, and the message in the lyrics is also very similar. They are celebrating true heavy metal in it's most straight-forward form, basking in the glory and the awesomeness its style. As I said the style they play in is relatively simple, putting most of the focus on the singer and the power of the message they are trying to deliver. Certain lyrical lines really are passionate and meaningful, pulling no punches and making it clear that this is what they do, and if you don't like it FUCK YOU. They make no apologies about enjoying the heavy metal lifestyle and they are in fact quite proud of it.\n\nMost of the guitar riffs are basic eighth-note strumming, usually on the open E string. The drums pound along in suit, and this forms the basic backbone for this album. It's a very driving, fist pounding feel, the way that heavy metal should be played. Some of the choruses are really epic, especially \"Brothers of Metal\", where the passion and the power is taken to the ultimate extreme. Every true metalhead who believes in this music and is willing to fight for it will love and relate to this album and what it stands for. \n\n\"Courage\" is a beautiful ballad and one of Manowar's best songs ever written. The first half is played by piano, then the heavy guitars kick in and the rest of the song rocks. It's a beautiful message, and it shows that Manowar truly care about what they're doing and can express their love for metal in a sensitive way as well as an aggressive way. \n\nThough Logan is not as good of a songwriter as Ross the Boss, he is at least as good of a lead player. His tone is like nothing I've heard before, and it matches perfectly to Joey's bass amp. The two of them I think were meant to play together. Some of his solos are actually really good, two that come to mind are the ones in \"The Gods Made Heavy Metal\" and \"Number One\". \"The Power\" is also an incredibly kickass song, in terms of speed, energy, aggression, and technical skill. Joey plays bass just as fast as Karl plays guitar, and the two of them shred the fuck out of that track. \n\nReally, the vocals carry this album and without Eric Adams as a singer I'm not sure how good this would turn out. He sings like a God. He has great tone, great expression, and a very masculine, muscular style. He's unique and a very fantastic frontman. \n\nSo, that's pretty much the just of it. The only downside to this album is that there isn't much variety, as I mentioned earlier the first 3 tracks all kind of sound the same. They really are all basically the same song, but they're really fucking good so that's not necessarily a bad thing, haha. I think you either \"get\" this album or you don't...It's certainly more over the top than anything they've done before, but that's just why I love it so much. It is Manowar doing what they've always done, just even more extreme in their beliefs than ever before. To the general public, this is probably not much of anything, but to real, serious, true heavy metal fans, this is one of the greatest things ever. Not everyone will understand, but I do.\n",
        "\nSo Manowar has returned with their re-recorded version of their 1988 album Kings of Metal. Manowar have always been a strange bunch to me with their over the top \"true metal\" image. Most of their classic albums have had some truly killer tracks with a bunch of filler. In all honesty, the band has not done anything even remotely interesting since 2002 with Warriors of the World and even then only 60% of the album was even metal. Kings of Metal is actually one of my favorites by them and I bought the original when it came out so I was interested in hearing this. Well folks, if you thought that Lord of Steel was the death of the band, this release is the nail in the coffin.\n\nThe track list is a bit different on this album than on the original. They changed some of the song titles as you'll see (with all of the song titles having MMXIV in them). The album start's off with one of Manowar's greatest songs ever, \"Hail and Kill.\" This song originally had the biggest balls of any Manowar song ever done. It defined metal. From the first note of the re-recording it's apparent that it's tuned down and slower. Eric Adams sounds okay but far from his glory days and it's apparent that it's tuned down for one reason...he can't hit the notes anymore. His screams are not as ballsy or as clear as in his prime and they sound forced. The production stands out as extremely slick with absolutely no balls at all. We can't blame that on the new millennium with all digital production since this album was originally was recorded in an all digital format. It actually sounds like Manowar does \"Dad rock.\" It's like it was recorded on a cheap pro-tools rig on a shitty budget. \n\nThe disappointments keep coming as the remainder of the album is more of the same. \"Kings of Metal\", \"THE Heart of Steel\", \"ON (wtf?) Wheels of Fire\", and \" THE Blood of the Kings\", the other ballsy songs on the album, have been brutally castrated by the production and the stale recording. And what the fuck is up with putting \"The\" in front of the titles of the songs? What would they do if any other band would have butchered these songs like this? Joey DeMaio would have called them out! Why would they do this to their own songs? And don't get me started on \" THE Sting of the Bumblebee.\" There's actually a metronome beeping on it! It's Joey being even more pompous than ever with him actually advertising his bass solo being 300bpm. So what!! It's sad and embarrassing. Even songs like \"A Warriors Prayer\" and \"THY (lol) Crown and THY Ring\" are worse and more cheesy than the originals.\n\nManowar have been going down this road for a while now. Each time they announce a release, I get my hopes up that they may at least try and recapture a little of their former glory. They've never been the most consistent band in metal but recently they have not done anything worth listening to. Now it seems that it is time for them to hang up their instruments and call it a day. They should have gone out on somewhat of a high note with \"Warriors of the World\". Their over the top true metal image used to be their \"schtick\" but now it's just embarrassing. Maybe they should just be like Kiss and do \"Farewell Tours\" every few years and only play their \"classics.\" Anything is better than this.\n\n\nhttp://elitistmetalhead.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nWhole album rerecords are a tricky business. On one hand, I've heard one rerecord that didn't stink up my speakers, but I would consider that a fluke. Individual song rerecords are a different matter, and often I enjoy those because they offer a fresh perspective and often times inject a new creative outlook into the song. But albums are a different story, and the tendency is that the new product is a much more lifeless, restrained affair since the creative mindset that went into the original album simply isn't there. \n\nOf course, that Battle Hymns wasn't my favorite Manowar album to begin with does this rerecord little favors in my eyes; but I'm not judging it based on such feelings. Really, what I wanted to know was this: did Manowar use the tools and talent they've acquired since the early 80's to successfully re-envision a classic album? No. Dimmu Borgir successfully reinvented Stormblast as a modern melodic black metal album (and even that was dicey) but Manowar offer no new insights here. The key issue here, then, appears to be that Manowar completely forgot what made them good in the olden days. While I preferred the more honed approach of Sign of the Hammer and Kings of Metal (which they are also recording), I understand what makes the original Battle Hymns good: the band was challenging themselves. The band had a fire under their asses, and tried to push themselves beyond what they could do at the time. The result might've been sloppy and Adams' vocals all over the place, but that was part of the charm. After all, if Darkthrone made their first string of albums with polished production and airtight performances, it would have been boring as all hell. \n\nAnother way of phrasing the criteria for a successful rerecord would be this: Does it add anything to the legacy of Battle Hymns, or does it cash in on said legacy? After describing what the original had going for it, I will now say that the rerecord is diametrically opposed to it. While I'm sure the original had equally barebones riffs, I don't remember it sounding this threadbare, and last time I checked Adams didn't sound asleep at the mic, too. While the members are largely the same, do not delude yourself, gentle reader: this is not the same Manowar. The performance is sluggish, more in line with their monolithic recent catalog, and I swear to god Donnie Hamzik did more than just \"bass snare bass snare\" and did a lot more fills on the original, as well. The simple fact is that nothing on this rerecord eclipses the original except the production values, which mean nothing if the performance can't back it up, and no member really pulls his weight here. Adams' performance is nothing special, Joey is out in front as always, but performs will little intensity, Logan has clearly done better performances, and Hamzik seems to have not taken the years off the stage well, as his technique leaves a lot to be desired. On its own, the performance and content here is about what you'd expect from recent Manowar, with the stripped down tendencies resembling The Lord of Steel rather than Gods of War, however. Still though, that would be if it were a new album. It's not, though. I give no credit for the inherent strength of the material because it's not original material. What matters here is if this added anything to the legacy of the original, or Manowar's legacy as a whole, and this simply doesn't cut the mustard. It's fuckin' BORING!\n\nPerhaps this was simply the wrong album to rerecord; Battle Hymns, in the original version, was raw, unkempt, and wild, and it sounded best that way, and this does no due service towards that ideal. Maybe the subdued nature of Manowar these days will better suit the rerecord of Kings of Metal, which they're doing right now. However, my gut tells me the opposite, and that this rerecord was dreadful because the band behind it has ran out of ideas, and been out of ideas for years now, and thus no new interpretation of the material is present because Manowar has no new ideas. This is most apparent in the faster songs like Fast Taker and Manowar, which despite their classification as \"faster\" songs, still have the feeling of an imperial procession and less of 4 guys rockin the fuck out. At the end of the day, rerecords are either two things: a band that wants to revitalize their old material with new inspiration and techniques, or a band that ran out of ideas and needs something to feed its fans lest they grow impatient. \n\nGuess which one Manowar is.\n",
        "\nYou will get people praising Manowar to the high heavens, when really the only good thing they ever did was Battle Hymns. Oh, okay; their other 80s shit was good too, and there are quality tunes scattered all throughout their discography \u2013 just listen to the face-smoldering ownage of \u201cBlack Wind, Fire and Steel\u201d for example, or \u201cHail and Kill.\u201d But mostly \u2013 and I hate when people say this most of the time \u2013 Manowar doesn\u2019t really deserve most of the praise they get.\n\nI know, I know \u2013 that\u2019s a clich\u00e9 worse than anything else you could say about music besides \u201cgeneric.\u201d Usually saying something is \u201cundeserving of praise\u201d is worth about as much as a three dollar bill. But from what I can gather, Manowar are popular because of a few things: (a) their early work is good and (b) they were just in the right place at the right time. Some bands get lucky with just the right pinch of influential sounds necessary to blow up and become a big hit. Manowar contributed massively to metal\u2019s image and lyrical standards \u2013 aside from Priest, I don\u2019t think any other band quite molded the looks and lyrics of their followers quite so much as Manowar. And on Into Glory Ride and Sign of the Hammer, they provided the blueprints for Viking metal. All of that is fine and well; I would be foolish to deny that.\n\nBut seriously. This album fucking sucks. Louder than Hell is a woeful piece of work with about as little work put into it as possible. This is the basest, most low-intelligence wrestling music you could ever imagine. Just a bunch of vapid shout-along tunes to serve as background music for an overweight spandex-monkey paid in a shady back room to go down in the 5th. Sometimes like on \u201cNumber One\u201d they vary it up a bit \u2013 that one sounds like a shitty sports anthem for a high school football team.\n\nOkay, okay \u2013 let\u2019s just try and actually review this seriously. The basic ethos here was probably supposed to be \u2018back to basics,\u2019 just some solid, rockin\u2019 tunes to jam in the car or while working out. Except it fails even as that, because the songwriting here is just too bare bones. This kind of riff-rocking approach only works when you have a meaty guitar sound and actually good, headbangable riffs \u2013 neither of which this has. The guitars on here sound like they were recorded in a cardboard box; while the production is mixed professionally, it just sounds weak and neutered really. And the riffs are about as interesting as wet toast. I can only even barely call them riffs. They're really the kind of dullard dad-rock plunking you hear in movies whenever a character enters a sleazy biker bar; barely any melody to it and no heaviness to speak of.\n\nIt's just a matter of degrees. There is playing simple, rocking riffs and then there is just not trying \u2013 this album is the latter. When they\u2019re not phoning it in with piano balladry about as poignant as what you\u2019d hear on an elevator, they are busting out very similar-sounding, very banal riffs that don\u2019t really have good enough songs to wrap around to actually work towards the album\u2019s sole purpose, which is to get you pumped up and ready to rock out on a motorcycle while wearing black leather clothes. It's not that erudite of a goal, you hacks. The bar is set low with this kind of music and still Manowar try to limbo underneath it anyway.\n\nThe songwriting is just deficient. These songs repeat and repeat with nothing interesting about them, no real catchy motifs except a few places like \u201cReturn of the Warlord\u201d and \u201cThe Gods Made Heavy Metal.\u201d But really that\u2019s about it. Eric Adams is a great singer, but he sells himself short with this. Just listen to him try to make \u201cBrothers of Metal Pt. 1\u201d engaging \u2013 to say the least, gruff heavy metal wailing does not work when the music sounds like something you\u2019d play at a geriatric asylum to calm the patients down.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to review this at all, because the music is so empty of meaning or real feeling in any capacity. The riffs are boring and the songwriting is one dimensional. Normally there are deeper reasons to give an album a score this low, but there really isn\u2019t much here. For a band of Manowar\u2019s stature, this is just unacceptable \u2013 they are one of the biggest metal bands in the fucking world. They have to have better material than this. And when you consider the fact that this band is so huge despite recording like five albums in the last 30 years, it just becomes so sad it\u2019s not even funny anymore. As good as Manowar can be at times, they\u2019re washed up has-beens \u2013 pretty much the definition of it. Fuck \u2018em. Pay attention to bands more worth your time.\n",
        "\nOriginally published at http://suite101.com\n\nThe last five years have been a very confusing time in the wimp and poseur free land of Manowar. The Kings of Metal were originally set to release an album called Hammer Of The Gods and put the Thunder In The Sky EP in 2009 as a promising teaser, but an apparent change of heart kept the concept from realization. In addition, drummer Scott Columbus departed in 2010 after a few years of ambiguity and sadly passed away shortly thereafter, allowing Battle Hymns pounder Donnie Hazmik to return to the throne as a full-time member.\n\nUnfortunately, the band\u2019s current dynamic keeps this promise from a complete fulfillment. The rhythm section throws things off as the drums are solid but have a rather robotic tone and Joey DeMaio\u2019s bass playing has hideous distortion that somehow drowns Karl Logan\u2019s guitar playing out even more than it already did! On the bright side, vocalist Eric Adams has held up pretty well and his husky delivery carries the hooks pretty well.\n\nSpeaking of hooks, the album\u2019s catchiness does redeem it in some aspects. Despite the horribly clich\u00e9d title (Seriously, guys, was The Triumph Of Steel not good enough for you?), \u201cThe Lord Of Steel\u201d starts things off on a very speedy note. \u201cEl Gringo\u201d and \u201cManowarriors\u201d also manage to be pretty memorable but the insanely catchy mid-tempo pace on \u201cBorn In A Grave\u201d makes it the strongest on here.\n\nUnfortunately, the songwriting itself is rather lazy outside of the hooks and the other tracks aren\u2019t quite as memorable. \u201cRighteous Glory\u201d and \u201cBlacklist\u201d are pretty good and would probably go over well in a live setting, but the former is a rather typical power ballad while the latter\u2019s plodding riffs aren\u2019t as powerful as they could be. \u201cTouch The Sky\u201d is also pretty solid but it would\u2019ve benefitted from some aggression to go along with its chorus.\n\nAnd like every other Manowar album ever made, the lyrics are a mixed bag. After the Norse-centric themes on the last few releases, the band reaches for a good variety of topics as \u201cBorn In A Grave\u201d has a fun vampiric theme while \u201cExpendable\u201d and \u201cEl Gringo\u201d have action movie aspirations. Of course, the majority of the songs perpetuate Manowar\u2019s prevailing themes of Vikings and self-congratulation. You\u2019d have to be an idiot to expect anything else but did we really need to hear another song with lines that consist entirely of song titles? As if ripping off the title of the best song they ever came up with wasn\u2019t enough of an insult\u2026\n\n\u2026And that sentiment seems to describe this album pretty well: It has a sound that listeners have come to expect and long for but it\u2019s too repetitive musically and lyrically to make a true impact. That said, it is a fun junk food release with a few great songs and I\u2019ll most likely get a copy of this when it is released in a non-MP3 format. Hopefully the band can really look into its past and realize they had more creativity and took more risks than they give themselves credit for. Just don\u2019t bring the bass solos back, DeMaio. You\u2019re the only person that misses them\u2026\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\"The Lord Of Steel\"\n\"Manowarriors\"\n\"Born In A Grave\"\n\"RIghteous Glory\"\n\"El Gringo\"\n",
        "\nAhh, Manowar, you bunch of ridiculous, self-glorious egomaniacs, how I've loved and loathed you. Having deemed planet Earth too puny for his ego, Joey DeMaio has relocated his legendary metal band to the dark side of the moon where there are neither sound limits to adhere to nor posers to stand in the way of his plans for total metal domination. The first result of this admittedly unusual recording location is \"The Lord of Steel\", an album named by the random selection of metal-sounding titles aligned to metal-sounding nouns, which when you consider they've already used \"Kings of Metal\", \"Gods of War\", \"King of Kings\" and \"Warriors of the World\" for past albums/songs leaves it about the most metal title left going short of plumping for \"Kings And Gods Of War, Metal, Steel, The World And Everything Else\". \n\nNow, it would appear the zero gravity atmosphere of the moon has inversely weighed down on the sound of Joey's bass tone for this, the Kings/Gods etc 11th studio release (\"Battle Hymns MMXI\" does not count), as it is positively BOOMING. Think not of the rumble of Lemmy, or the blower bass of Voivod, this is bass distortion like never before, but sadly as I do not live on the moon nor own a remote mountain-top location where \"Manowarriors\" et al can be blasted for all they're worth I shall never know if this tactic really works as its recorder intended. Instead I shall declare it the very definition of OTT self-aggrandisement and let you judge for yourself.\n\nWhat of the songs I hear you ask? Well, for a band who have never exactly pushed the boat out with their compositions they have this time dragged the vessel so far inland it has become a museum piece to landlubbers. Guitarist Karl Logan and new drummer Donnie Hamzik compete to see who can be the most boring and uninspired - straight from the title track opening the album their tones sound weak and toothless, as if they've been phoned in at the last minute. Hamzik's beats for the faster songs on the album - \"Lord of Steel\", \"Expendable\", \"El Gringo\" - are monumentally uninspired, while Logan, who has always shown a knack for a good riff or melody despite being the Robin to DeMaio's Batman, does very little of note.\n\nMusically most of the tracks sound like pale imitations of past Manowar glories, ripping off their historic victories while adding an awful bass sound. \"Black List\" sounds like a reject from the \"Warriors of the World\" era and takes an age in order to never get going; \"Expendable\" harks back to \"Fighting the World\"'s feel; while \"Hail, Kill And Die\" is so far from the classic \"Hail And Kill\" and a desperate attempt to reference it lyrically as to be embarrassing. Save for Eric Adams' vain attempts to inject some passion there is no saving what sounds like a band still rehearsing and fine-tuning their songs for the final album recording. Piercing the veil of unending criticism, it\u2019s not all bad \u2013 \"Born In A Grave\" and \"Touch The Sky\" have a fist-pumping tempo and simple effectiveness about them that would not make it onto a Manowar \u2018best-of\u2019 but at least amid the muddled thinking on offer give a brief opportunity for enjoyment.\n\nOn \"The Lord of Steel\" Manowar have attempted to become of their hordes of German imitators - Sacred Steel, Metalium, Metal Force, Stormwarrior etc - but failed in doing so. The songwriting is stodgy, predictable and formulaic and the bass and guitar tones in particular are appalling, leaving me wondering who are the deaf journalists behind the quotes declaring this \"flawlessly heavy\" and \"a brutal and unstoppable force of molten metal\". For almost any other band this would be the death-knell on a glorious career but with Manowar and their outsized egos I'm worried it will only go further to encourage them their fight is a true and worthy one against 'posers' like me who just don't get it. Talking from the perspective of a long-time Manowar fan, I do get it, I just don't want to accept it.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nTo call this demo \"the dawn of epic metal\" is a bit pretentious, I realize, as well as vague enough to seem inaccurate to many people. To call it the first epic metal release, on the other hand, is much more specific, if not necessarily true. I cite here one other earlier album often considered epic metal, and that is Legend's From the Fjords. However, having listened to the album, although it does have some epic moments, it really tends to be proto-metal - that is to say, epic progressive folk/hard rock, although it does have some metallic elements. Some may disagree, but it's my opinion that epic metal was born not in 1979, but 1981 - with Manowar's godly song \"Battle Hymn\".\n\nManowar's influences here are probably dualistic; on one side, the traditional metal sound of Judas Priest and their ilk is pretty obvious, while on the other, epic music a la the aforementioned Legend. I don't really listen to a lot of stuff pre-metal, so it's hard for me to say who they were really influenced by. Classical music? Folk music? Epic rock like Hawkwind? Possibly any and all of these, as this is really pretty fucking original for metal. Along with Kansas metallers Manilla Road, Manowar pretty much created the epic metal genre. Not to say that things hadn't been building up towards it, but they were the first practitioners, and a band from whom many similar bands sprung (although, to be fair, Manilla Road are more influential than they are).\n\nWell, however it happened, here it is, and I can't help but think it's a pretty damn natural combination. Heavy metal was always a place of chaos, turmoil, and destruction, and the battlefield is a perfect place for that. Not only that, but I suspect Adams and co. (or at least the primary lyricist) were into escapist literature a la LotR to some extent, as \"Battle Hymns\" is quite medieval in theme - something not completely unheard of in metal at the time, but not exactly common. Obviously, this would become popular in both power metal and epic heavy metal, although rather than being directly influenced by Manowar, I'm fairly certain it's just a case of common interest; fantasy nerds saw metal as another form of escapism (as I certainly do).\n\nWhile the production here is pretty abysmal, it's not unlistenable, and for a 1981 demo, it's hard to really discredit it. Adams sounds strong as ever with his strong, clear, masculine tenor, and the riffs are certainly nothing to sneeze at. Midpaced and chunky, they set the stage for future bands that play in the slower, more sprawling and atmospheric style found here. While not exactly doomy, they're bigger than most of those played in traditional metal at the time. The song structure on \"Battle Hymns\" is pretty simple, yet proud, with major chords and a cool bridge. Adams is probably the highlight here, but everything is in full gear, assuming you can make it past the production. Simply one of the finest songs heavy metal has to offer.\n\n\"Shellshock\" on the other hand is not exactly what I've been describing; straightforward, rocking metal, it's not very epic (in the sense of the term I've been using), but still quite solid, with catchy riffs and another fantastic performance from Adams. Although I've been highlighting the title track here, make no mistake - this is a good song, as much as it may be dwarfed by its older and bigger cousin. Manowar show here that they're not messing around - although unfortunately, things wouldn't stay that way for very long. Still, this was a start to a very successful - if ultimately pretty shitty and boring - career, and an interesting, if not hugely enjoyable, listen.\n",
        "\nMy oh my, what has become of the legendary Manowar? When I heard the first measures of the opening title track \"The Lord of Steel\", my first impression was actually quite a positive one. There was actually a guitar there, and it was actually playing a riff! However, this enjoyable first impression faded all too quickly, as the rest of the album turned into a rather redundant mixture of supposedly tried-and-true heavy metal and Manowar clich\u00e9s, ranging from the lyrics which just sound like pieces of former Manowar songs' lyrics put together randomly (\"Hail, Kill and Die\"? Really?) over bland song structures devoid of the great and epic moments we've loved so much about the band in the past, to a terrible misuse of one of the greatest voices in heavy metal today in Eric Adams, who isn't even given the chance to really shine and showcase his skills.\n\nBut that's not even the worst thing about this album. So Manowar haven't written another \"Kings of Metal\" with this one. Alright, they also didn't manage to do that with \"Gods of War\". Or even \"Warriors of the World\", for that matter. But, and this I can but keep shaking my head about it, what in Odin's name have they done to their sound? The artificial drum computer sounds like it's coming straight out of a cheap PC sound card, the guitars pack little punch and the bass... oh Lord of Steel, the bass... seriously, I don't know what Joey DeMaio was thinking when he told his sound engineer to mix his bass sound the way he did, but this just sounds like an explosion in an old 8-bit video game, and nothing at all like a heavy metal bass guitar. \n\nBut where there's Eric Adams, there's usually always hope. Even if it's but a faint glimmer, even if it is but a straw to cling to; there is always Eric Adams. And this Eric Adams, who in my mind is the single perfect vocalist for this type of classical heavy - or \"true\" - metal; well, he stays rather bland and non-descript in this outing. Not because he can't do it anymore like he used to, but because band mastermind Joey DeMaio obviously doesn't let him do his thing anymore. Where are the insane screams, where is Adams' world-renowned \"Evilizer\"?! Over most of the record, he just sings in a middle range, and while the feeling and accentuation are definitely there, his great voice is just never given the chance to really impress us. And it's a shame, I tell you.\n\nSo what remains after we've sat through songs like the cringeworthy \"Manowarriros\", the unbelievably cheesily titled \"Righteous Glory\", the almost poppy half-ballad \"Touch the Sky\", the uneventful \"Expendable\" or the at least partially enjoyable \"El Gringo\"? Unfortunately not much, my friends, apart from a slightly bitter sensation of disappointment on our tongues, and the feeling that the Manowar who delivered groundbreaking works such as \"Into Glory Ride\", \"Sign Of The Hammer\" or \"Kings Of Metal\", are just irrevocably gone, and have ascended into the halls of Odin far beyond. Maybe all Joey DeMaio can really do well anymore is give strange and self-righteous interviews, talk about \"trueness\" and what it's like to \"die for metal\"; but I can't shake the feeling that it isn't Manowar who've died for metal, but that it's metal that has died for Manowar.\n",
        "\nDespite what opinions you may be having about them, Manowar truly have a knack of descending into utterly horrible depths of self parody. Be it with their macho image or their self proclamation of kings or their war for metal or their utterly laughable lyrics, this band has literally become the laughing stock of heavy metal. Things did not improve as these guys failed to mature with age. With time, Manowar has declined both in musical and lyrical terms. Things do not change drastically with The Lord of Steel and this band walks down disgracing their own career which earlier had some very enjoyable power metal cuts. \n\nEric Adams is horrible behind the mic. His voice has lost its charisma and power. He barely manages to keep up a steady note and the performance to a professional level. The riffs are basic and repetitive. The lead work is better but does not rise up to be the saving grace of the album. The production is at least guitar oriented and we finally have something to cheer about. But production can never be the saving grace of any album, no definitely not with mediocre music written underneath it. \n\nAmong the songs, every song is short, to-the-point and with crunchy guitar riffs and guitar oriented production you cannot have anything to complaint right? Wrong. This kind of music works only when you have strong and catchy choruses to back up the songs an element this album lacks in abundance. Goofiness in lyrics is permitted to a point, but please gentlemen don't you find it a bit annoying and silly when Eric Adams sings about waging wars for heavy metal. Most of the songs are overlong and repetitive offering little to capture the listener's attention. Some variety is offered in the pace among the rockers, but that little to save this record. Credit given where credit is due. The highlights include the opener title track and the catchy Born In A Grave where the chorus works just fine for a change. The rest of the songs are lifeless at best and lack intensity. The total simplicity of the music compounds the problems even more. \n\nBottom line, this album is too cheesy and dullard for even an one time listen. The phrase 'Fallen from grace' describes Manowar's recent mediocrity which continues with this album.\n",
        "\nI believe this to be the greatest release of heavy metal history. Everything about it is perfect. Here we see Manowar, empowered by the reception of their first release, going down the route of creating the first great epic metal albums in the style of the last two full songs of Battle Hymns (their debut). Having dropped Donnie Hamzik, he is replaced by Scott Columbus (RIP) on this release.\n\nThe album starts with a hard and happy speed metal number called 'Warlord'. This is basically a song about riding Harleys and screwing teenage girls and begins in a rather amusing way. It's fast, heavy, and entertaining - a simple song, but executed perfectly.\n\nThe rest of the album, however, has a very different feel. All the other tracks are absolutely epic. Secret of Steel is a incredible song: it's haunting, the guitar and Joey's custom bass do some unusual work which still hasn't been matched, and it almost sounds progressive without the pretentiousness. 'Hatred' is a dark, aggressive, and yet slow song; it has some very eerie passages which create an atmosphere not usually found in traditional heavy metal to this extent (with some obvious exceptions). \n\nThe guitar on this album is brilliant as Ross the Boss doesn't bother with the fretboard masturbation that was on the ascendency in 1983. Instead, he is a more traditional guitarist who feels every single note he plays. Ross' playing draws the listening into the music and I would much rather have music you can get lost in than the replacements who weren't capable of such magic. \n\nThe drumming is brilliant as Scott was a very creative drummer and didn't just rely on recycled, generic beats. 'Gates of Valhalla' particularly showcases his ability to enhance the other instruments with his drumming. Joey, the mind behind most of Manowar's material, gives a sublime performance on the bass guitar and with no bass solo wankery ruining the continuity of the album. Secret of Steel stands out for him.\n\nBut the true highlight of the album is Eric Adams' vocals. This is probably the greatest vocal performance in the history of rock music. His voice is power with a tremendous range; he can go from being a speed metal powerhouse to an operatic maestro with incredible ease. He employs beautiful falsetto and death-defying screams, singing a high G and A with his full voice. There are few words which do his performance justice. Just listen and remember that it is unlikely that a singer will ever reach these heights again.\n\nAll in all, this is groundbreaking and ultimately is very influential. Highlights include 'Secret of Steel' and 'March for Revenge', but really, every track kicks ass!\n",
        "\nAh Manowar, the only heavy metal band in existence at the time this album came out, other than Black Sabbath. This is according to them of course. The irony is that this is as much a rock n roll album as a heavy metal one. There's nothing crushingly heavy about this or anything they've done, despite their claims to the contrary. Like their peers in Manilla Road and Cirith Ungol, they took a few albums into their career to shed their hot rockin' roots. \n\nThe first five songs are all rock songs, although they do a bang-up job at writing rock. These are summertime, '70s high-school parking lot songs, especially Metal Daze. Shell Shock has a slightly metallish intro riff and is sort of heavy. The song Manowar, meanwhile, is muscular and has a big, feel-good chorus. If He-Man sang in a rock band this is what it would sound like. Eric Adams sounds so young and vibrant. He comes from the Dio/Dickinson school of vocalists: his strength is in a clear, powerful midrange punctuated by high notes. \n\nTheir sound is bass dominated but guitarist Ross the Boss shared equal songwriting credits on this album with Joey Demaio. The man had a positive impact on this band, even though his writing contributions would be scaled back to a song or two per album after this, his solos were always good. Donnie Hamzik meanwhile, is a busier drummer than Scott Columbus.\n\nDark Avenger is where the band starts to really flex their metallic muscle. A brooding, crushing bass riff drives this song to the narration part, with the guitars complementing instead of dominating the sound. It's different from the conventional rock mentality but adds to the originality of this band. This song ends on a speed metal note with Adams screaming his lungs out and The Boss burning through solos. Williams Tale is the reason this is one of the few Manowar albums that is good right through and that's because this is the one time where they got the bass instrumental right. Every bass solo they did after this is fucking stupid. \n\nBattle Hymn ends the album in the most epic fashion, a fist-pumping anthem that would make even the most pacifist peace-loving hippie want to go to war. It will get you ready for Hyborian Age battle. Robert E. Howard would be proud. The riffs are simple but mighty, the chorus with that ancient background chanting will take you back a thousand years and the solo just rips my head off every time. \n\nSure, this band would become cheesy and pompous down the road, but in these days they were one-of-a-kind songwriters. I can't really think of anything else to compare this to. Maybe Judas Priest meets Dio meets Kiss, but these guys do their own thing. This is recommended for anyone interested in classic metal. It's got a pump-you-up with good vibes kind of feel to it.\n\nVictory! Victory! \n",
        "\nNinety percent for an album in which near half the songs could best be described as \"eccentric\" or \"strangely endearing\" at best, or \"godawful\" or perhaps \"what the hell, an opera cover?\" at worst, depending on mood. This probably requires some explaining; I guess the simplest way to put it is that an album is an album is an album, not merely a collection of random songs; thus, if the album as a whole gets my dick hard and my neck hurting, I can and will sing its' praises irrespective of how head scratchingly weird some of the song choices are.\n\nThe vocals here are a big part of what makes the filler tolerable and the better (heavier) tunes so excellent. Adams' vocals are always goofy, but always super earnest, as charismatic as Hitler, always passionate, manly as shiiiit and they always sound supremely excellent. Sure, 'Nessun Dorma' is nothing if not proof that opera is damn hard to pull off and best left to professionals, but how many other metal vocalists could make \"An American Trilogy\" sort of (sort of) work? It should sound awful, and I guess if you're looking at it objectively than it is, but as it's hard to hate, say, a retarded duckling, so it is hard to hate Adams' full on, give-everything-to-the-song-and-sing-glory-glory-hallelujah-unironically-over-and-over-again thing that he does in that tune. Despite the flute, piccolo bass, constant talk about living in Dixie and the fact it's some sort of super old civil-war era song or something I've apparently played it 11 times the whole way through. He even pulls off 'Fight for Freedom'- another one that should maybe sound like an Iced Earth b-side at best, but instead is perhaps the best 9/11-never-forget song ever written. Not that the competition's fierce, but still; it works; I think? It's catchy, it's patriotic without being too vomit inducing, and it's catchy, and it's really catchy. Thanks mostly, again, to the vocals.\n\nSo it's no real surprise that when there's actually good material to sing over, shit gets really off the hook. Interesting to note that there's not really many- if any?- good riffs at all throughout the entire album; there's a heavy 'Euro power' thing in that most every rhythm guitar part is just a chord progression for huge vocals. Function over form though; most of the songs aren't what you'd call complex but they work for what they are; simple, epic songs with tight arrangements, heaps of energy, and a solid production. Certainly some of the strongest choruses in Manowar's catalogue; 'Call to Arms' is a highly underrated song with a real rousing chorus, whereas the last few tunes on the album tend towards much speedier realms but with a similar dedication to cheesy metal valour. Again; Adams to thank. Shit lyrics, not many riffs; but a very angry american delivering cliche martial lyrics with such authority and enthusiasm that you'll fall in behind Manowar with no reservations.\n\nBut y'know, while the rest of the band (even DeMaio's pretty reserved on this album) are there mostly in service of the godlike vocals, they do a good job and serve the songs unfailingly, so credit where credit's due. I was previously only really familiar with Logan's work on the new Battle Hymns which suffice to say hadn't endeared me to him but here he sounds, if not particularly amazing, tight and fun to listen to. Nothing's particularly shreddy or crazy but whether it's the super fun soloing in Hands of Doom or the speed metal freight train (definitely the song with most of the album's riffs) that's House of Death, it sounds like he's having a fun time. \n\nAnd perhaps that's what sums this album up- perhaps that's why I like despite the few fairly awful tunes, despite the general lack of riffs? It's catchy, it's energetic, and it's fun fun fun. Manowar sound like they're having a good time, and the material is catchy enough for it to drag you into it hook line and sinker. It honestly seems like disliking this album would take serious effort, as turning this up is such a pleasurable experience. A few very very goofy songs, but highly recommended!\n",
        "\nThe sad thing about this album is that, unlike most other Manowar albums, it actually has some pretty good ideas strewn throughout; unfortunately, they're rarely nurtured in a way that would make the songs enjoyable enough to listen to all the way through. Sure, if you cut out all of the quality sections, you might have fifteen minutes, give or take, of good music, but it would hardly be listenable like that. If you expected another Hail to England, you're definitely going to be disappointed, though it does at least have some energy to it, unlike Into Glory Ride.\n\nTwo things, at least, are in top form here. The production, unlike that of the previous album, is quite good, with a strong guitar, strong vocals, and nice, solid drums. Adams is, as usual, in top form, sounding just as good as he did on the last three albums (for a more in-depth description of his vocal delivery, check out my review of Hail to England).  Unfortunately, this also features one of the biggest faults of HtE; the godawful bass solo. This time titled \"Thunderpick\", we are once again subjected to three minutes of some of the worst shit ever recorded; just a mishmash of seemingly random notes, strewn together actually somewhat masterfully in the least enjoyable way possible; it actually takes some skill to make something sound this shitty.\n\nThankfully, the rest of the album isn't quite as abysmal. The rest of the songs basically fall into three categories; crappy AOR a la Battle Hymns, ballads, and decent epic power metal. \"All Men Play on 10\" and \"Animals\" fall into the AOR category, with few riffs and boring, poppy vocal lines, these songs have very little substance and elicit very little response. They are entirely skippable, with no redeeming qualities. The ballad of the album is \"Mountains\", which is also quite skippable, with little energy and plodding, meandering riffs a la Into Glory Ride, although in the ballad's defense there are a few good ideas towards the end of the song, they're just discarded almost as soon as they arrive, discarding any sort of structure in favor of the directionless mess we're presented with.\n\nFinally, there are four songs that don't utterly suck, including one song that is actually excellent. \"Guyana (Cult of the Damned)\" is decent, a song about Jim Jones and his cult that committed mass suicide via poisoned kool-aid; while the material is interesting, the song is pretty inconsistent. There are epic parts of the song, but ultimately it just sort of drones on; overall it's not particularly good, with few good riffs or vocal lines. The vocals towards the end of the song do have some energy to them, thankfully, but it's not enough to make the song as a whole worthwhile. The title track is of similar quality, with a promising opening but just not enough substance to make it enjoyable overall. \"The Oath\" is marginally better, with good vocal lines and a slightly more epic orientation, the song is reminiscent of Virgin Steele's The House of Atreus: Act II, albeit a bit worse. However, it's worth at least an occasional listen, has some good soloing, and is mildly enjoyable.\n\n\"Thor (The Powerhead)\", thankfully, is quite epic, and easily stacks up to the best material on Hail to England. Great riffs, great vocal lines, a great chorus, this song is the epitome of what Manowar should have been, creating a wonderfully glorious atmosphere that leaves the listener wanting more. Unfortunately, even an album of this quality isn't consistent for Manowar, and it would be the last \"good\" album they would release, before descending into complete and irredeemable shite with the follow-up. Sign of the Hammer marks Manowar's dying breath, although, to be fair, they'd been on the brink of death since they began their incredibly inconsistent journey in 1980. Listen to \"The Oath\" and \"Thor (The Powerhead)\", and then go check out some quality epic power like '90's Virgin Steele!\n",
        "\nWhen someone refers to the \"classic period\" of Manowar, they're generally referring to the first four albums, or possibly the first six, before the departure of guitarist Ross \"The Boss\". However, despite the mounds of praise that are laid before these albums (the first four in particular), I don't see what's so \"classic\" about them. Sure, they're early, influential slabs of epic metal (for the most part), and perhaps that alone is enough to grant them classic status, but I'm fairly certain, given the amount of praise these albums receive, that it's not given on the merit of their influence alone. I mean, Helloween's Keeper of the Seven Keys albums were extremely influential on modern Europower, yet you see plenty of people shitting on them. So why no hate for Manowar's influential material? I mean sure, Hail to England wasn't bad, but as far as I'm concerned, the others are, at best, mediocre.\n\nI will admit that the very fact that they were pioneers should cut them a little slack; given that they were exploring new territory, they didn't have any precedents on which to build, so you can't really blame them, right? I partially agree with this, I suppose. While it's true that they didn't have much to build on, and that they were quite groundbreaking, it doesn't make the music suck any less. Sure, they were pioneers exploring new territory. They also made music that at times is less enjoyable than eating shit. While I'm grateful to them for inspiring much better bands, such as Valkyrie (who took particular influence from this album) and Enchanter, I still find myself wishing they could have done so without hurting my ears quite so much.\n\nHowever, there are a few positive aspect to the album. The production, for one, is quite good, with a strong guitar tone and solid drums, with the vocals given just the right amount of prevalence. If only the riffs weren't a complete failure on most of the songs, this could have had the makings of a slightly decent album. The other good thing is Eric Adams, whose clear, manly, slightly screechy tone hasn't changed any. He probably should've quit the band and found some musicians who actually knew how to write songs, because unfortunately his talent is completely wasted on this vapid, pseudo-epic, saccharine pile of feces. Okay, so I may be overreacting a little bit - mainly due to the presence of two particularly awful songs in particular - \"March of Revenge (By the Soldiers of Death)\" and the utterly abysmal \"Hatred\". Going nowhere from the beginning, the songs manage to descend from the merely boring into actively irritating drivel, from the stupid hard rock breakdown in \"Hatred\", to the silly, inane chorus of \"March\", even Adams manages to sound bad at times, particularly some of the screams on \"Hatred\". Gone is any trace of truly epic metal, and in is everything I hate about Europower; the flowery melodies and the lack of real riffs in particular; add to that a complete lack of direction, and you have these two songs.\n\nMost of the songs, thankfully, are tolerable, merely mediocre rather than actively bad. \"Secret of Steel\" and \"Gloves of Metal\" fall into this category, meandering without aim and continuing without energy. There are occasionally some good ideas here, but they're quickly cast to the wayside in favor of slow, plodding boredom. \"Warlord\" and \"Gates of Valhalla\" are slightly better, though still not very good, though I will say that the intro to \"Warlord\" is much more enjoyable than the rest of the album; I would certainly prefer to hear forty-five minutes of female pleasure moans than forty-five minutes of this bullshit. The main song of \"Warlord\" rides a decent riff, nothing ambitious, but not really a failure, either, as it really just aims for being very mildly enjoyable, and manages to achieve it. The simple, faster riffing of this song is probably what Manowar should have gone for with this album - it might have kept it from being a complete mess. \"Gates of Valhalla\" has some sections that are actively good, and for some part is enjoyable, but other sections (such as the intro) are completely useless and manage to mostly ruin any success the song might have had.\n\nFinally, \"Revelation (Death's Angel)\" is the one good song that keeps this album from being a complete waste of time; with a galloping drumbeat, a solidly glorious main riff, and a good vocal line, this represents what Manowar perhaps could have been, had they not seemed obsessed with playing in as asinine, paradoxical, and aimless a manner as possible. This song reminds me of some of Virgin Steele's material, which represents what I just described (at least from 1994-2000). Particularly when Adams sings out \"when the end is coming\", I'm reminded of VS's \"Arms of Mercury\"; this song is actually quite epic, which just demonstrates the potential the band are squandering with the vast majority of their songs. A pity, but at least they left us with a few songs to enjoy and wonder what might have been. The album is an utter disappointment, to be sure, but then, I hold such low standards for Manowar that I wasn't very disappointed anyway; rather, I'm pleasantly surprised when the manage to pull their shit together and not fuck up. 1/7 songs is not a very good record, but then, perhaps this should be considered one of Manowar's classics, as after the first four albums it was consistently 0/x. Yes, folks, this is one of Manowar's better albums, which should clue you in on my opinion of the band as a whole. They never \"turned to shit\" - they've always been shit, since the very first album, and this is a perfect example of that.\n",
        "\nAdmittedly, Manowar are a hugely influential band on modern power and epic heavy metal, with various bands, such as Enchanter, Wizard, Twisted Tower Dire, and Valkyrie, drawing influence. Releasing the epic metal anthem \"Battle Hymn\" in 1981, there is no denying the fact that they were quite groundbreaking in their early years. However, groundbreaking does not amount to excellent, which is something they certainly weren't. Generally putting out only two or three good songs an album, they were more than likely successful because the vast majority of listeners are only interested in hearing one or two great songs and then singing the band's praises. I mean, take a look at Painkiller, one of Judas Priest's most successful albums. Fans listened to the fantastic opening track and then started unabashedly jerking off to the album, unaware that the rest of the songs were mundane mediocrities. I won't go into even more popular bands, such as Metallica, because that would in fact be unfair to Manowar, who, despite being overrated, do have a small collection of quality songs.\n\nHowever, thankfully, this album was something of an exception to the rule; while far from masterful, it manages to contain less filler than most of their albums, instead bringing in the useless drivel in more conservative doses - but don't be fooled, it definitely still has a presence here. It's just overshadowed by the more solid numbers. \n\nThe best thing about Manowar is unequivocally Eric Adams. In the '80s he was at the top of his game, and this album his no exception. His strong, clear, slightly screechy tone is only outmatched by his absurdly impressive range. A common comparison is one between Adams and Virgin Steele frontman David DeFeis; however, I don't really see the similarity. While both of the respective bands play epic heavy/power metal (at least at, they did at some point in their career), Adams' screechy belting is quite different from any of DeFeis' various styles of delivery, which range from barbaric roars to sensual croons. Both are talented, but quite different from each other. In truth, Adams' delivery is actually pretty unique - I haven't really heard that screechy quality in any other metal vocalists, although if you remove it he sounds pretty similar to Brian David Osborne, of the relatively obscure band Enchanter, who, as I mentioned earlier, took quite a bit of influence from Manowar. For the vast majority of you who probably haven't heard Enchanter (although you should, as they're excellent), the closest comparison I can make is to combine the more raspy, aggressive performance of some of your earlier heavy metal and NWOBHM vocalists (David Potter of Cloven Hoof, for example) with the range and clean operatic style of Geoff Tate and his many, many imitators. It's not a great comparison, but Adams is, as I said, pretty damn unique.\n\nThe first complaint here is the production. While not fuzzy or buggy at all, which, for 1984, is something of an accomplishment in itself, the guitar tone is fairly tinny and low in the mix, while the most prominent instrument is the bass. I'm not sure why that is, as the bass lines are pretty simple and the songwriting definitely puts the emphasis on the guitar riffs, but that's how it is. Still, the album is far from unlistenable, and it's more of a slight annoyance than a real hindrance to the album's enjoyment. The second complaint is, of course, the songwriting. While more consistent than anything else they've done, they still manage to put in two mediocre songs (\"Kill With Power\" and \"Each Dawn I Die\"), as well as one pile of steaming dog shit (aka \"Black Arrows\").\n\nHowever, for a band so mired in utter mediocrity and pointlessness, they have managed to progress their sound quite a bit over only three albums. The debut was traditional hard rock/heavy metal, Into Glory Ride was a more epic, doomier affair, while Hail to England incorporates quite a bit of power metal - in fact, I'd call it predominantly power. Glorious, catchy, and midpaced, it's a style of power that would be often imitated - and, in this case, just as often surpassed. Okay, I was half-joking there, as highlights like the excellent title track, complete with rousing chorus, and the mysterious, desperate, slowly building \"Blood of My Enemies\" are certainly pretty difficult to compare to. \"Army of the Immortals\" is pretty good, too, with solid riffs, if a bit oft repeated, and Adams' equally repetitive vocal lines get annoying after about the first go-round. However, the good qualities of the song outweigh the annoyances, so I guess you could say that this song is pretty representative of the album as a whole - annoying at times, but decent.\n\nOf course, there are other songs here that quite a few bands have already succeeded in surpassing; \"Each Dawn I Die\" starts off with a shitty riff accompanied by equally shitty harsh vocals, and doesn't improve much from there. There are a few decent sections, but not enough to save the song from utter mediocrity, while \"Kill With Power\" does manage to be slightly better, although the intro and chorus are quite awful. \"Black Arrows\" is in a realm of its own, with a stupid attempt at a cool intro that just descends into completely abysmal guitar wankery that a 12-year-old in his bedroom could surpass without trying to (not in technical skill, obviously, but certainly in the level of enjoyment I could get from it).\n\n\"Bridge of Death\", on the other hand, is an interesting album epic, that is in fact quite good, although a bit different from the other songs presented here. It opens with a tremolo riff, which, combined with the Satanic lyrics, could be argued to be a precursor to black metal. Now, I'm not sure how many black metal bands were actually directly influenced by this song, but it does make for an interesting juxtaposition; while probably more influential on the black metal scene, than say, Mercyful Fate (I'm still not sure why so many people claim it was such a huge influence on BM), I'm sure it wasn't nearly as groundbreaking as Venom's Welcome to Hell. Even so, it's definitely an enjoyable song, and in '84, a bit darker than the norm for heavy metal bands, with the long, progressive structure resembling a descent into Hades itself (the spoken word part is especially cool). The Christmas-themed bells at the end are a little bit of a head-scratcher, but ultimately the song is quite good, keeping the listeners attention despite being nine minutes long.\n\nUltimately, the album definitely isn't bad, and if the only comparison to make were of Manowar's other albums, it would be a masterpiece. However, there are many, many other bands out there better than Manowar, and as it stands, this is not among the most impressive of albums, though, it does do well for the most part, and, if you skip the three shitty songs, it can be quite enjoyable (just listen to \"Army of the Immortals\" in small doses). Up to this album, Manowar had been consistently improving...if only they had improved some more, perhaps they would have been worthy of the praise they constantly receive.\n",
        "\nManowar's latest album has been the subject of much criticism in the metal world; and not undeservedly. I tried to engage it with an open mind. I tried to look at the bright spots and I'm not saying there aren't any. Truthfully, this is pretty much a dilapidated, decrepit version of the Manowar seen on recent albums like Gods of War, Warriors of the world, and what have you. It carries the standard Manowar sound and retains all of the themes that have given this band so much recognition, be it positive or negative, over the years. Their ego is as bloated as ever, and as such, you can expect to sit through a plethora of cheesy shameless self promotion, with the word steel employed at every possible twist and turn, slaying the hordes, ascending to valhalla; pretty much standard Manowar with the exception of musical quality. \n\nSooo...the quality. Yeah. Manowar have taken a pretty significant dip in quality on this record. There isn't a single memorable track on this record, and the music lacks the ferocity displayed on older records. One of the main deplorable aspects of this album for many people is the bass. I'll admit, I'm one of those guys who never really pays much heed to elements outside of the rhythm guitar and vocals on Manowar records, or almost any standard metal record for that matter. As such, the screeching prominence of the bass on this album may not bother you if you're anything like me. Eric Adams doesn't do any high notes on this record to the best of my recollection. This isn't to say his performance is particularly bad, just lacking. This album also seems to have traded in Manowar's power metal edge for a more straightforward approach. I fucking hate that. I loved power metal Manowar. The songs are mostly mid tempo, they're not particularly catchy, and the riffing is average at best, although there are some pretty nice leads at moments, such as on \"Black list\".\n\nThe best songs? Well, truthfully, that's kinda tough. Like I said, none of the songs are really memorable, but I suppose I should point out that they're also pretty repetitive. I do feel I enjoyed the first half of the album more than the second one, though. But that could just be my brain growing tired. The song \"Righteous Glory\" I guess could be considered the best on the album. It's basically the only ballad, and it features some pretty cool notes from Adams. I may just be favoring it because it doesn't put emphasis on those bland riffs like the rest of the album. \n\nWell that pretty much covers what I have to say regarding this record. I may dare to call it Manowar at their worst, and I wouldn't advise wasting good money on it, unless you have tons of money to waste, or have trouble falling asleep at night.\n",
        "\nThere was a sermon composed back in 1835 by an esteemed reverend of the Second Presbyterian Church of Albany William B. Sprague titled \u201cDanger of Being Over-Wise\u201d that I read during a study of 19th century American history. While the bulk of it dealt with disputes between differing sects over what constituted proper sacramental observance and church doctrine, one particular passage that struck me was a warning regarding the so-called \u201cTemperance Movement\u201d that was pushing for what eventually became the full out prohibition of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The gist of it all was basically that in the name of purifying the church of the problem of alcoholism, these fanatical legalists were essentially turning their backs on the entire faith, not to mention unwittingly paving the way for the rise of organized crime and tyrannical encroachments upon the civil liberties of all Americans.\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel an odd sense of commonality with Reverend Sprague\u2019s sentiments, though naturally in an unrelated subject, when I read all of these melodramatic reviews from one end of the internet to the next regarding the so-called flop that is Manowar\u2019s \u201cThe Lord Of Steel\u201d, the 11th studio album in a grand 30 plus year glory ride, casting their steel to the 4 winds. The problem is that I literally cannot square a single thing I hear on this album with anything I\u2019ve read in the metal media, be it the bigger names out there or the hardest core of the independent crowd. Far from being the tired, battered, and steeped in ineffective clich\u00e9 mess that one would guess from all the hoopla, this album is a rather surprising return to former glory that\u2019s been missing from the equation for the better part of 10 years.\n\nIf there is one album that this one instantly reminds of, it would be that of \u201cFighting The World\u201d, admittedly not the magnum opus of the band\u2019s lengthy history, but definitely a respectable work that brought the band some media exposure. This comparison is mostly in the overall spirit of the album, which is an exercise in unapologetic campiness, featuring lyrics that are about as compelling as any low grade, sword wielding barbarian flick from the mid 80s that didn\u2019t enjoy the privilege of a wide theatrical release. The songs are very simply crafted, hearkening back to the most basic tricks of the trade that were brought in with the early 80s offerings of Judas Priest, Twisted Sister and the first couple of Running Wild albums. It\u2019s easy to sing along with, easy to get into, and the hooks stick with you for a good long time.\n\nThe overall production of this beast is about as retro as it gets, making the references to reliving the past justifiable, but hardly in a negative sense. The guitars are the one area where things are somewhat modern, being possessed of a chunky crunch that is actually somewhat along the lines of a lot of modern Viking metal bands, while the bass is massively present though not quite as raunchy as on most of their previous albums. The drum work is surprisingly thunderous and glorious, a bit of a surprise given that the kit master hadn\u2019t done much with this band since the original incarnation of \u201cBattle Hymns\u201d. The only thing on here that sounds somewhat aged and limited is Eric Adams\u2019 vocals. He still has most of his former range, but all the years of screaming his throat out on the punishing tour circuit has taken a toll, and most of what is heard here functions in a lower tone growl with only the occasional banshee wail.\n\nThe songs are mostly an exercise in 80s heavy and power metal orthodoxy, playing off riff sets and melodic lines that are repetitious and clearly crafted for the live venue. The opener \u201cThe Lord Of Steel\u201d has a fairly run-of-the-mill principle riff that is heavily reminiscent of Running Wild\u2019s brand of speeding metal mastery. In fact, along with yet another crowd pleasing, mid-tempo anthem to their fans in \u201cManowarriors\u201d, the opening offerings of this album all but hint that Joey and company have been listening to \u201cThe Rivalry\u201d and \u201cPile Of Skulls\u201d. Of course, this wouldn\u2019t be a Manowar album without tons of down tempo crushers with drawn out spoken narratives, all supplied by Adams in his usual grandiose storytelling whisper. \u201cBorn In A Grave\u201d and \u201cBlack List\u201d bring to mind the same pompous largeness that would inspire Quorthon as he transitioned out of 1st wave black metal into his next craze in \u201cHammerheart\u201d.\n\nNo matter how many times I hear this album, it never once gives an impression of being tired sounding, nor any more derivative than any album that Manowar has done since \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d. But somehow there is a strong contingent of stalwart fans of this band that will tell me, in direct opposition to what I hear, that this album is a train wreck, almost as if insisting that because they\u2019ve stuck with this band for a given amount of time that they are in a position to tell everyone that, to quote Ronnie James Dio, \u201cBlack is really white and the moon is just the sun at night\u201d. The roar of the critics is definitely possessed of an unquestionable wisdom, as if every sage I\u2019ve never heard of and a few I have opining on the matter. But thankfully I\u2019m not so wise as to prevent myself from enjoying another fine piece of true heavy metal, and you shouldn\u2019t be either.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve seen way too many horrible reviews on this album so I am glad I get the chance to share my opinion with you all. I will admit in the beginning, listening to the album only a couple times, I hated it. It made me sad to think that this power metal giant had slipped so far down in their career. However, now that I\u2019ve listened to this album a few dozen times, the songs have grown on me and I actually enjoy blasting a few of them out of my stereo. So a fair warning to you all, give the album a chance.\n\nThis album is strong and heavy, in true Manowar style, but a wee bit pretentious, I will admit. The album breaks down as follows - half of the album is decent, a quarter of the album is bland and stereotypical but still a pleasant background listen, and the remaining quarter seems like the band said \u201cThis song took us ten minutes to write, but we\u2019re putting it on this album because you\u2019ll buy it anyway!\u201d and I\u2019d rather not speak of that. I don\u2019t feel any sort of epic-ness from this album; it\u2019s very stale and bland and could have used a lot more of that old hard-hitting energy the band had in their prime. It\u2019s a solid Manowar sound\u2026 only aging. Eric and Donnie feel like they\u2019re giving about half of their energy to the album. I can\u2019t complain about the guitars as a whole, I just wish the verse riffs weren\u2019t so muted, because when the guitar has it\u2019s moment to shine, it REALLY shines. The production is also seriously at question here, I really would like to know who told Joey DeMaio that all of that fuzz and gain on his bass sounded good! I love a loud and prominent bass player, I think more bands need to utilize that instrument, but holy hell\u2026 record it a little bit cleaner next time.\n\n\u201cManowarriors\u201d is a fun song, but the more I pay attention to the lyrics, the more I ask myself why I am enjoying it so much. The drums and riffs are somewhat stale, the bass, though very prominent is hard to listen to, and the guitar solo is great but short lived. This is one of those Manowar songs about how awesome they are \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, time to leave!\u201d is an actual lyric in the song. Righteous Glory, however, is a slower song on the album and I absolutely love this song. It\u2019s well written and recorded, the bass isn\u2019t so awful, and the lyrics are about Valkyries which is my favorite part of Norse Mythology. Odin knows my name in the hall of the slain\u2026 YES MANOWAR. More of this! You have a giant hammer on the album cover\u2026 give me some more Norse references! \n\nThe next three tracks on the album aren\u2019t awful, but they\u2019re very mediocre and somewhat dull. Some songs have their moments, like in Touch the Sky. I really like the chorus and bridge as the song builds it gets better and better, and it just makes me wonder why they didn\u2019t put that energy into the entire song, not just towards the end. Black List has a nice, groovy introduction, but all I can hear on that bass is gain, gain, gain! It would sound much cleaner without it. El Gringo, though ridiculous as hell, is a decent song! It seems they put more energy into this one and you can hear it right as it starts. Despite its strange concept, I really enjoy listening to it. The guitar riff at the beginning is probably the coolest riff on the album, and I\u2019m bummed it only lasts a few seconds. The song kicks it up a notch with a high energy solo at the end, which I wish was much longer, but it was much appreciated as is. The album ends with Hail, Kill, and Die which has an amazing groove to it. It\u2019s slower, low energy but builds throughout, and has some nice driving drums and riffs. It\u2019s a nice way to end the album, with a chorus chanting HAIL! KILL! AND DIE! and a bad ass solo. Now this is Manowar, and I am proud to listen to this song.\n\nAll in all, the album is a slight disappointment, but I think most others are not giving it a chance at all. Upon first listen, it seems stupid, and corny, and not in the good way. Listening to it more and more it has surprisingly grown on me as I learn the lyrics and meaning behind each song. I can understand why so many people are disgusted with it, and are begging Manowar to stop making music, but it's hard for me to sit here and say I'm not wishing for another epic release from Manowar. I will continue to follow them and support them until they either give up, or give us another power metal masterpiece.\n",
        "\nEvery band that stays around for longer than 20 years eventually will get to the point where they're at a fork in the road; they can either rest on their laurels and rely on a formulaic version of their sound, or they can innovate. Manowar got a LOT of criticism for Gods of War, with fans claiming it was bloated, self-indulgent, and cheesy. Well, my personal thoughts about Gods of War aside, the fans will bite their tongues and curse their wish, for when you took all the symphonics and epic songwriting from Gods of War, you have The Lord of Steel. \n\nThe reason I compared this to Yngwie's \"Unleash the Fury\" is because Unleash was Yngwie's stereotypical sound, minus all the tools he had acquired over the years to improve his sound. Likewise, The Lord Of Steel would've gotten a significantly higher rating from me (still not a good rating, but above 50%) if this had been the debut album of some unknown heavy metal band. Nonetheless, this is Manowar we're talking about. We all know that they are capable of something besides blandly written and played verse-chorus-verse heavy metal, and we all know that their production team definitely earns bou coup bucks, so why does this album sound like shit? The guitars are the weakest I've heard from Manowar, with NO presence, NO kickass riffs, and NO frills with the solos. \n\nIt almost seems as if, after Scott Columbus died, Manowar just gave up. They were going to continue their Asgard saga (I would've rated this so much higher if they had decided to do that) but abandoned the project. This, on the other hand, sounds like it was hashed out at the last minute so that they didn't get eaten alive by their long-expecting fans. After four years of touring, we have this. Even on the albums I like the least (I'm looking at you, Louder Than Hell), there were still songs I liked. Many, in fact. On this, no song really jumps out, except for the bottom-of-the-barrel Manowarriors, which struck me for both the songwriting and lyrical stupidity, and Hail, Kill, and Die (the title doesn't even make sense), which was a blatant rip-off of their greater years. Most songs will simply slide right off your ears and you will not remember a single riff from this album.\n\nAfter listening to The Lord of Steel, I have come to the conclusion that Manowar are entirely a memory now. They may still exist, but they exist only as a memory of their glory days. They create nothing new, and listening to this album, as well as their modern live material, I hear a band living in the past. They as a band only exist to recreate this mythical past constantly, with more and more overt self-imitation. There's nothing for the loyal and hapless Manowar fan. I'm sorry, but unless they start shitting gold, I'll start looking elsewhere for kickass heavy metal.\n",
        "\nOh, Manowar... Even through your ups and downs, I've tried to stick up for you, but after this... I just can't do it anymore. Gods of War? Yeah, there may have been a lot of cheesy interludes and perhaps it was a bit overambitious (but... \"Loki, God of Fire?\" HE WAS NOT THE GOD OF FIRE) but I replied \"It's a concept album! You have to take it as a whole, not a track-by-track basis!\" Battle Hymns MMXI? Maybe it wasn't necessary, but I replied, \"Lots of bands redo classic albums of theirs! And Donnie Hamzik returned to the band for the first time since Battle Hymns, why not? Plus they got Christopher fucking Lee to do narration for 'The Avenger!' How kickass is that?!\" But this... I just can't defend this album. It's like if Majesty (NOT what Dream Theater used to be called, the other Majesty) decided \"Hey, we're enough of a Manowar tribute band, let's do a full-out album like Manowar would do! Except take all the triumphant cliches they're known for and just suck the absolute life out of them. And make most of the album a mid-paced plodding bore.\" \n\nThe first 20 seconds of the opening titular track are about as exciting as it gets on this album. A heavy, triumphant and speedy guitar lick from Karl Logan, and it does sound really promising, but then you start to notice something... \n\n\"What's that buzzing in the background? Must be a bee in the studio, maybe they'll edit it out of the retail version or something.\" And then that look of horror comes across your face as you realize... It's fucking Joey DeMaio's bass guitar. Joey's ginormous ego has finally gotten the most of him. Writing and producing all the band's work just wasn't enough for him. He has to stick out musically like a sore thumb. The bass isn't as annoying to listen to as say, Spiral Architect's debut (only?) album, but there are moments when you can't help but notice how distorted and fuzzy the bass is. \n\nAnother easily apparent problem with the album is a serious lack of inspiration. Just looking at the track titles, \"Touch the Sky?\" \"Annihilation?\" \"Righteous Glory?\" \"Manowarriors?\" Didn't Manowar wear that shtick out back in '92? At least \"Gods of War\" branched off into Greek mythology and shit! The whole \"battles, glory, and power\" schlock is really wearing thin, especially given the band's very uninspired performance. And as bad as the lyrics are (even for Manowar's standards), \"Hail, Kill and Die\" has to be the laziest and most uninspired song in Manowar's discography. It's literally \"Blood of the Kings, Pt. II\". (but with an extended title of ANOTHER song from the same album... God, the laziness of this just kills me) I love \"Blood of the Kings,\" but I mean this in the worst way possible. It doesn't even creatively try to incorporate the titles of Manowar albums/songs into the lyrics like the first one did. It just lazily lists them off IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER with no real lyrical connection. Manowar was even so lazy as to incorporate a song title FROM THIS ALBUM! (then again, Blood of the Kings did that too, but still...) \n\nThe band's performances also aren't exactly up to snuff. Eric Adams' vocals lack the power they once had (but having been in the scene for 30 years, I can forgive that. He still has a lean, mean mid-range, I just wish he would at least TRY to let out a shriek or two). Donnie Hamzik's drumming is as simplistic as can be (minus the sweet drum roll in the opening of the title track) and Karl Logan's solos just aren't memorable. It's not all bad, though. The lengthy instrumental opening of \"Black List\" (easily the best track on here) opens up a lot of potential for live jamming and some of the tunes are decent fist-pumpers. But there's a definite lack of a certain spark from earlier albums which left even jaded cynical bastards like me grinning from ear to ear with how over-the-top Manowar were. \n\nIn all, this album is much akin to recent Simspsons episodes. All the basic elements are there but over the years, they've lost the heart of what made them memorable in the first place no matter how much they try and revisit the past. Not a definite clunker, but recommended to only the most hardcore of Manowar fans (dare I even say... Completists only?)\n",
        "\nThis album is a proof that one band can attempt to reach a larger audience without changing sound identity and attitude. Do not listen to these review who talks about the band selling-out, making pop songs or being too commercial. With this album ManOwaR has advanced into a better produced, cleaner sound, but did not let go the power and over-the-top approach the band is know for. Yes, there are some 'stadium songs' and some cheesiness inherent to the 80's metal but it's a very conscious move that shows how the band has reached maturity and is now trying to reach a larger audience - good! - I think this is the first Manowar album that got me hooked, banging to the drums of the title track!\n\nProduction-wise, the band never sounded this good, Demaio's bass, which was louder than the guitar on previous albums, finally found the right balance on the mix and sounds heavy without taking room from Ross The Boss, not the most skilled guitar player out there but one who can pull out some good riffs. Drumming is heavy and with many double-bass pounding. The opening track of the album is very iconic and any Manowar fan recognize it immediately. Eric Adams sounds confident as always. If you want an example of how great the album sounds, turn up the volume, jump to 2:28 on the first track, while Eric sings \"see my brothers standing by my side\" backed with muted notes. That is a hell of an opening, and a great song to perform live with many crowd participations, something that became a staple for ManOwaR. The lyrics are just plain fun and captures the kind of feeling we have when we are the only person with a distinct opinion on music and culture on general.\n\nMost controversy on this album comes from Blow Your Speakers, but if you think about it, is just another rock'n'roll song like the others before it (Animals, Warlord, Fast Taker). The lyrics are actually not bad, it's a shame that people did not follow its advice to ask the radios to play Rock'n'Roll!! Maybe if it were recorded by Kiss it would become a classic like I Love it Loud. BTW - you might have noticed how the cover art on this album looks like Destroyer from Kiss. \n\nAfter these two songs, the band returns to the Conan-esque theme with a great anthem Carry On - which sounds awesome live, the double drumming Holy War and Violence and Bloodshed. There's also the epic Defender - in the same blueprint as Battle Hymns and March For Revenge tough not as good. Now let me talk about one of the best ManOwaR songs ever; Black Wind Fire and Steel. This song alone makes the album worthy, the way the it starts is mind blowing; Demaio's bass fires a single note like a machine gun, then a verse of pure Might & Magic greatness:\n\nFull moon's light is calling me\nMy kingdom lies within\nThe mystic soul and lion's heart\nBrought by the talisman.\nThe ecstasy of battle takes me\nWhere the falcons fly.\nImmortal youth was granted me\nI will never die.\n\nIt's a fast, powerful song with great lyrics, chorus and musicianship, Manowar doesn't get better than this. Fighting The World delivers everything a fan might hope, there are epic and fast songs, stadium anthems for crowd participation, catchy choruses and excellent production. Not one single bad song, making this one of the most consistent Manowar albums to date.\n",
        "\nManowar released their brand new album in such a weird way, that I know people who lost interest in it just because of this. Sure, it is available through download, but the only way to get it on a CD right now is by buying a special edition british Metal Hammer. Is it really worth tracking down on ebay or even waiting till September for a retail release? Not really.\n\nFirst of all, I'm a big fan of Manowar and have favorite songs on every single LP. Even the critisized Gods Of War. I kinda hoped that Manowar would go in this direction with epic melodies and mythological themes. I was wrong. Lord Of Steel sounds like a tribute album to Manowar. Well, not even that, it sounds like some not really good musicians tried to mock Manowar exposing every clich\u00e9 they ever used.\n\nThere aren't really any stand out track here, maybe \"Manowarriors\", \"Born In A Grave\" or \"El Gringo\" are catchy at first, but there is such a high level of monotony that they will get boring rather quick. So I'm just gonna talk about the album as a whole.\n\nThe drumming is more boring than ever. It is true that Manowar always relied on simple, solid beats, but this is just primitive. While listening to some songs I just wished that Donnie would at least do a simple drum roll when it was a perfect moment to emphasize the epicness of the upcoming part. But nope, most of the time you will hear simple, hihat + bass, hihat + snare, hihat + double bass, hihat + snare over and over and over, sometimes crash cymbal, that's all. The guitar is boring as well. There are barely any noticable riffs, most of the time it's just single power chord strums. The solos aren't really anything interesting, most of them are short and rely on shredding. Even the bass sounds awful. All the great crunchyness and power of the bass tone from previous albums are gone. Instead it's very distorted in a weird way and sometimes barely hearable. Vocals are rather okay, although Eric doesn't sing so many high notes anymore and some melodies sound forced.\n\nI already said something about the cliches. You know you've heard some parts before in Manowar music, but now it sounds worse. There is chanting like in \"Hail & Kill\", soft accoustic breaks like in \"Battle Hymn\" and some guitar licks just sound reused, for example the intro melody from \"El Gringo\" sounds very similar to \"The Power\". The only clich\u00e9 barely used here is the trademark high scream of Eric, which always fits Manowar music, but for some reason there aren't so many of these. He still manages to do them live so what the hell?\n\nLord Of Steel is a rather boring album and in my opinion the worst Manowar LP ever. It sounds like they are running out of ideas, but it's not only that. It wouldn't be so bad if they just relied on style from previous records and made some predictible songs. The songs here are just really really boring, streched withouth a reason and lack any creativity. It's as simple and primitive as it can be. Some choruses are catchy and maybe you will like a song or two, but it's more painful if you just listen to older stuff. I only used this cd on parties, when no one is paying attention to the music, but it's nice to hear some guitar buzzing in the background and sometimes we chant the \"El Gringo\" chorus with friends while bored during a car trip. Other than that, it's not worth your money. Stick to the classic Manowar albums.\n",
        "\nThe new Manowar album finally is out after a long wait and anticipation. At the very second I've heard it was available online I rushed to make the download. My first reaction to the opening guitar riff was \"hell yeah!!\" but then, the bass.. \"WTF!!?\"\n\nThe Lord Of Steel is the full-length successor to the much criticized Gods Of War (2007). In my opinion GOW had many problems of length, awful narration, and pretentiousness; but it was packed with awesome songs that proved their value on the God Of War Live album, including the new mandatory classic Die For Metal. But I do not like when people overlook Thunder In The Sky EP (2009), All 5 songs kicks so much ass and it's the best from post-2000 Manowar. It showed that Manowar still had the guts to deliver fast, powerful and straightforward songs.\n\nBefore releasing this new album Manowar made an excellent marketing campaign with teaser videos on YouTube, songs for the movies El Gringo and Expendables, partnership with Metal Hammer magazine and even put the whole album to on YouTube (!!). For all these reasons I was on high expectations and I fell so hard on the ground. For real, Joey, what were you thinking when you turn that Fuzz Pedal on? Didn't no one on the studio said \"man, this sound like shit, its a bee's nest!\" Playing straight eight-bars notes isn't helping too, you know. Were did the awesome production from Battle Hymns MMXI go? The sound is unbalanced, peaking on lower notes and losing all the punch on the higher ones. Didn't you tough the title \"Manowarriors\" were a bit ridiculous? I guess you will have a hard time making people sing that chorus on the concerts.\n\nThis problems doesn't kill the album tough, some good tunes are Born in A Grave, a welcome mid-tempo that avoids the words \"metal\" and \"steel\", Righteous Glory it's a strong ballad with acctually good lyrics, Touch The Sky has the catchiest chorus and a good guitar solo (it will sound awesome live) and Black List is a real stand-out, with a long instrumental headbanging introduction; it's a sinister song and the first time Joey bass sounds right.\n\nThe other songs are El Gringo and Expandable (good riff, bad chorus) but they don't help the album, Annihilation is a filler. Last; Hail, Kill and Die is an abomination that should never got into the album. It has the same concept from Blood of The Kings but doesn't have half the juice and dirty the name of the band's anthem Hail and Kill. I even think they should made a Blood of The Kings part II with expanded lyrics if that was the point.\n\nWith only 10 songs, Manowar have listened (a bit too much) to the fans and cut off all the epic feel from Gods of War releasing a much simpler album, but fails to deliver stronger songs than those on their previous efforts. The bad mixing and fuzzy bass lower the standards and this might be their worst release to date. If you're a fan, tough, I recommend downloading Touch the Sky and Black List.\n",
        "\nAh Manowar, one of my favorite childhood relics. The legend was born in 1980, Auburn New York. Back in the day they were something fresh and original. They had something of a purity about them in their early years. They strove to be the best and the top, yet the mainstream likes of glam metal and new wave bands kept on beating them down. It was this undying effort that brought us timeless classics such as \"Battle Hymn\" or \"Blood of the Kings\" or \"Bridge of Death\" or \"Hail and Kill\". These days (since Louder Than Hell anyways) their music has gotten progressively worse. I don't know what happened to them. Maybe it was the 1990's and times were changing. No one was interested in the likes of Manowar anymore. They all got distracted by Grunge. Now they bring us a new album \"lord of steel\". Finally, lets get to the album. I've waited 4 years for a new album to come out. They promised us \"hammer of the gods\" two years ago but never followed up. Rather than release an album they hyped up that had some promising tracks as exemplified from the \"Thunder in the sky\" EP; We get this. A trashy last-minute excuse for a CD completely void of humanity and creativity. \n\nFirst off, this album has not 1 high note scream that passes the 3 second mark in length. In fact, I hear maybe 2 screams on the whole CD. It is nearly void of one of the key elements that make Manowar who they are and gave them some identity. This alone cuts the final rating down by 25%. Eric's vocals are harsh and pushed without any soul or effort behind it. Its not even that he is old, its just he doesn't seem to care anymore. Even at his age he should be able to diversify his singing from high notes to low notes and belch a few rough screams. Joey needs to back off with the overly fuzzy and distorted bass. Where is the nice clean sounding distorting we heard from \"Battle Hymns\" or \"Hail to England\"? Now it sounds like he recorded the whole CD with his bass plugged into a broken speaker. BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ was the obnoxious noise that I heard in the background through almost every song. What was Joey smoking when he thought this distortion sounded nice and was a good idea? Karl Logan's guitar playing is more stale than ever. Come on dude, cant you do anything else besides play a rift in E and shred without thought? Karl has no creativity and because of him many of the songs sound the same. The drums are exactly same throughout the whole album. 48 minutes of the same single bass with snare drum and occasional high hats.\n\nThe lyrics are predictable and repetitive along with the instrumental lines. Not one song doesn't include at least 4 of these words \"Grave\", \"Battle\", \"Die\", \"Glory\", \"Hell\", \"Steel\", or \"True Metal\". The album opens up with \"Lord of Steel\", the single most forgettable song they have ever written. The first 30 seconds sounded promising, that is all. \"Manowarriors\" and \"born in a grave\" are both repetitive and without any humanity, period. They both actually sound like the same song with switched out lyrics with one having rehashed lyrics that sound like \"Army of Immortals\" and the other sounds like it rehashed its lyrics from \"House of Death\". The main point is that they aren't doing anything new or creative with these two songs.\n\nThen came the power ballads that followed after the first few tracks. Its hard to believe that there is no soul in this ballad either. Like the past few tracks, the lyrics are without any real emotion or thought put into them. Keep in mind that this is from the very same band that brought us awesome ballads of the likes such as \"Master of the Wind\" and \"Mountains\". The rest of this album does nothing new in terms of music. \"El Gringo\" and \"Annihilation\" are kinda catchy. Possibly the only two tracks that are worth a few listens and have some memorable chorus? To bad both their choruses get old after being repeated for like 6 minutes straight without any real solid input. These two tracks however do not make up for the other eight plain tracks on this album. They finish this album with \"Hail Kill and Die\". Yawn, what happened to finishing their CD's with epic tracks and actually offering some good closure? This song is anything but good closure to the album and only sounds like something you would hear at near the beginning. Once again they rip off their own lyrics from one of their earlier works.\n\nI was really looking forward to a new Manowar album after all this time. When they stopped working on \"Hammer of the gods\" and the whole Asgard saga thing I was very disappointed. It just pains me to know that they let themselves get this bad. I listened through this CD so many times, just trying to convince myself that there might be something of a gem hidden somewhere in the depths of this album; But no.Everything about this album is sterile, even the album cover. Where is Manowar's mascot? Where is the army of guys bearing the flags of the world which symbolizes their unity? I guess Manowar has forgotten what they are about. Or is that just Joey Demaio. Maybe that's the problem? Joey himself. Joey is the guy behind every interview, the man working on every one of their DVD's and songs. He seems to think that he is Manowar and all the other band members should just do as he says. I think that the other members need challenge him more on his writing and give some of their own input. Because from my understanding, he is the one that wrote the whole CD on his own. A band is a team effort, and everyone needs to pitch in with some of their own creative juices, or if their isnt any left; then I think its better if they just take a break for a little while. Manowar is one of my favorite bands, and that is why I am being generous on my final rating. Better luck to their next album which should come out in another 6 years or so. Hail and Kill!\n",
        "\nWe always learned about the real taste of Heavy Metal from old-school Metal bands. Great bands like, \"Black Sabbath\" and, \"Iron Maiden\" were a great example of professionalism and energetic music that inspired people for decades, the only downside about the old-school sound is that it has been changed by the emergence of new sub-genres. Consequently, the original sound of the old-school became extremely rare, although, on the bright side, there are some old-school bands always trying to keep this kind of music alive for the next generation. This brings me as to why I am here, celebrating the release of the 12th album by the legendary Heavy/Power Metal group, Manowar.\n\nThe time machine that is Manowar has been turned once again; the inspirations of the albums, \"Into Glory Ride\" and, \"Battle Hymns\" were resurrected from history and were reanimated by once again. I admit that the album doesn't have the same quality of songwriting and effort but, at least it gave us more old-school songs from a real old-school crew. Many expectations are subconsciously created when you read the news about the new album of Manowar for the first time, some people thought that this album is a bad move and could destroy the noble lineage of this amazing band, especially after the album, \"Gods of War\" that had a lot of haters around the world (actually I loved that album so much though it sounded different than the old Manowar). Though, some people thought about it in an optimistic way, and to be honest, I am of the same outlook. I really loved many touches in this album and it reminded me a lot of the real Manowar, though, the modern production destroyed the theme that we are used to hearing while listening to old-school albums. \n\nThe album contains many old influences from, \"Kings of Metal\" and, \"The Triumph of Steel\u201d. The secret power that exists in the previous releases of Manowar is still alive and breathing here but with the addition of modern production and innovative licks that surround the whole record. The result being old and technical Heavy Metal riffs, with modern mastering quality. The hero vocalist, Eric Adams still retains his power as if he protected his golden throat with steel, my first expectation for this album was about the quality of the killing vocal lines, and yeah, I really liked every single word uttered from Adam\u2019s golden throat, the power and strength are still burning bright inside of him. \n\nThe guitar work in the tracks, \"The Lord of Steel\u201d, \"Manowarriors\" and, \"Annihilation\" show the wonderful motion of energy, Karl Logan has tried his best with Manowar since 1996, his magic with the solos and the amazing performance on the tours proved that he is a real guitar hero. The bassist, Joey DeMaio (who also played the keyboards and produced in this album) provided great bass licks and many flexible, warm touches. To be completely honest though, I really hated the production, especially the rhythm guitar that encircled the sound behind the vocals and the solos. It sounded like the backtrack of an old Sega game, which is clearly noticeable in some tracks like, \"Born in a Grave\". \n\nBehind the noise of the old Sega game sound, Donnie Hamzik was dominating the drums like a real monster, he was the drummer of the band's debut album, \"Battle Hymns\" so we can easily notice that he gave this record very old-school beats. His flawless work gave so much positive points to this album. My favorite elements presented on the record were the vocals, the solos, the drums and, the bass licks; no one in this world could enjoy listening to such a disturbing guitar sound. \n\nIf you are into Manowar, then this album is a must-own for the reason that, not only does it contain a lot of old-school influences, but that it provides the listener with many new places to visit. Though, buyer be warned, some things related to the production will annoy you but I am sure that you will love the songwriting, the solos, the vocals and, performance. Get yourself a ticket to the time machine that is, \"Lord of Steel\" and go back to the early 80s.\n\nRecommended tracks: Righteous Glory, El Gringo, The Lord of Steel, Black List\n\nOriginally written for:\nwww.jorzine.com\n",
        "\nMANOWAR have always been a controversial band because of their primitive lyrics, exagerated bombastic sound experiments and a ridicolously martial image. Even though the band\u2019s last entirely convincing record was \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d that came out almost twenty-five years ago, the band still delivered a couple of energizing metal hymns in the past years as \u201cCall To Arms\u201d, \u201cWarriors Of The World United\u201d, \u201cThe Sons Of Odin\u201d and \u201cGods Of War\u201d from to mostly heavily criticized records but also some exclusive single material as \u201cThe Dawn Of Battle\u201d, \u201cI Believe\u201d, \u201cDie With Honour\u201d or the power ballad \u201cFather\u201d that was released in sixteen different languages. \n\nNormally, everybody should know what to expect when one listens to this band: A superficial cover with many fantasy themes such as muscled warriors and naked princesses, epic metal tracks with simple but efficient choruses with lyrics that any immigrant could write after three years of English classes, interludes with bombastic choirs and artificially flavoured orchestras, fast banger for the old school fans and the usual kitsch ballad about an unsung fallen hero.\n\nThis time, it didn\u2019t exactly come that way and this new record came as a very negative surprise to me. The strange release policy with special editions for mediocre metal magazines, downloads and only a quite late release in retail stores was already confusing. The simplistic old school cover didn\u2019t help, too. What finally counts is the music though and from that point of view, this record definitely is one of the worst records I have ever listened to in my entire life. I listened to this record once and I hope I\u2019ll never have to listen to this again. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the production and the efforts the musicians put into this record. The boring, faceless and highly repetitive drumming sound so artificial that I think a drum computer was used rather than a real drummer. The bass guitar heavily dominates the production and sounds very irritating, noisy and unclean. After two sons, the bass sounds gives me ripping headaches. The guitar solos never sounded so uninspired as on this record. They sound emotionless, hectical and simplistic. They seem to never fit to the songs. Even the vocals can\u2019t save this record and sound quite strange as if they were recorded in a hurry. Sometimes they don\u2019t fit to the music and I have never heard the normally very strong Eric Adams sing that bad. The whole production lacks of energy, sounds sterile and very unprofessional. The band maybe tried to go back to their roots as there are almost no choirs or orchestral passages on this record but the loveless production only reveals that the musicians\u2019 talent has heavily decreased as this lack of quality isn\u2019t hidden by bombastic sound samples anymore. This record shows us the true face of these pretentious whimps and posers. \n\nThe song structures aren\u2019t any better than the music itself. The lyrics are simplistic as usual but this time the band even cites itself and tries to honour its past days. They fail and damage, dishonour and soil their strong past efforts by creating something as bad as the album closer \u201cHail, Kill And Die\u201d. The band\u2019s straighter tracks sound repetitive and unconvincing and bore to death, even the shortest ones as \u201cExpendable\u201d. The half ballads or epic tracks have not only a predictable structure but are artificially stretched to unbearable lengths and lack of emotions as in \u201cBlack List\u201d. Even the songs that could be mediocre and not plain awful are so repetitive in the end that they simply aren\u2019t anything that disappointing in the end as the weak \u201cEl Gringo\u201d that was written for a movie soundtrack and that is the only acceptable song on this record because it has at least some powerful vocals before they get redundant and are repeated to death. \n\nIn the end, the so-called kings of metal have fallen and this time, there are no glorious moments at all on this record. The band has become a caricature of their own past and this is their definite low after an unconvincing rerecording of their first record \u201cBattle Hymns\u201d. There are worlds between the band\u2019s first energizing albums when they were still original, faithful to their fans and did many amazing live shows and what they have become today - a faceless bunch of defeated and tired warriors that dig in their own past and who have lost all their promising musicianship as they deliver the worst metal record I have ever listened to in my entire life. This record is not even worth to be written about and I only do this to warn the true metal fans out there to not touch this record and live the biggest musical disappointment ever. Manowar \u201cfail, chill and cry\u201d and have become the true losers of metal.\n\n(Originally written for The Metal Observer)\n",
        "\n\u201cSign of the Hammer\u201d is Manowar\u2019s fourth studio album. Incredibly enough, their first four full-lengths were all published in a span of little more than two years and, as a both varied and highly consistent effort, is deserving of the highest praise. In this humble reviewer\u2019s opinion, this is in fact Manowar at their very best, as it stands as one of very few of the band\u2019s albums without any bad songs on it and, beside some very good ones, boasts a number of standout tracks as well, be it the fast and furious title track, the majestic and pounding \u201cThor (The Powerhead)\u201d or the truly epic \u201cGuyana\u201d and \u201cMountains\u201d.\n\nEven the prototypical filler track, \u201cThunderpick\u201d, works much better than most previous or later instrumentals whose sole purpose is really to provide a platform allowing Joey DeMaio to show off his phenomenal bass-playing skills (cf. \u201cWilliam\u2019s Tale\u201d or \u201cBlack Arrows\u201d). The reason is that \u201cThunderpick\u201d actually features some rather catchy passages and, with its unmistakably South American-tinged melodies, makes perfect sense as a kind of overture to the following epic track \u201cGuyana\u201d. In fact, I don\u2019t even see them as two separate tracks but rather consider \u201cThunderpick\u201d to be the intro to \u201cGuyana\u201d. Consequently, even when I don\u2019t listen to the album as a whole, I hardly ever listen to \u201cGuyana\u201d without playing \u201cThunderpick\u201d first.\n\nTrack number two, \u201cAnimals\u201d, features incredibly goofy, sexually charged lyrics but otherwise passes as a solid hard-rocking tune that\u2019s really fun to sing along with. Then again, if you were seriously expecting to find meaningful, thought-provoking or even poetic lyrics on a Manowar album of all places, you must have spent the past thirty years living under some sort of rock. When speaking of lyrics, though, \u201cSign of the Hammer\u201d nonetheless has to be considered one of Manowar\u2019s best or, if nothing else, least embarrassing efforts. Even the usual self-adulating fare as in \u201cAll Men Play on Ten\u201d has a likeable tongue-in-cheek quality to it that makes it a lot more palatable than the many instances when Manowar were seriously touting themselves as THE heaviest, fastest, most brilliant, most uncompromising \u2013 in short, most earth-shattering heavy metal band of all time. \u201cThor (The Powerhead)\u201d is based on Norse mythology, \u201cThe Oath\u201d delivers an occult and gore-inspired message and the title track includes some very memorable lines as well. It is the two long tracks, however, which deserve special mention in this regard: as a song title, \u201cMountains\u201d may sound kind of dumb at first, but the song is not so much about mountaineering or mountains in a physical but more in a metaphorical sense, using mountains as a symbol for human ambition and perseverance. The final track \u201cGuyana (Cult of the Damned)\u201d may even be the band\u2019s best lyrical effort ever, dealing with Jim Jones\u2019 Peoples Temple and the mass suicide of his followers in Guyana in 1978. It is a very sinister subject in and of itself and, knowing what really transpired back in the day, the infamous opening line (\u201cThank you for the Kool-Aid, Reverend Jim\u201d) is downright creepy. Overall, the song serves as a grim and surprisingly thoughtful tale of blind faith and devotion gone horribly wrong.\n\nThe production on \u201cSign of the Hammer\u201d is nothing to write home about, as it sounds quite dated \u2013 this was released in 1984 after all \u2013 and more than a little muffled, but it serves as one of those examples where an underwhelming production doesn\u2019t detract from the overall quality of an album but rather lends it some additional charm. This is clearly a product of the eighties musically, so that typical early 1980s sound is only fitting.\n\nThe cover artwork is somewhat peculiar, sporting a black hammer symbol (the eponymous sign of the hammer, supposedly) in a white square that is tilted by 45 degrees. The square is placed inside a red box displaying the band logo and name of the album, and that box in turn is set against a background that looks distinctively like tree bark. It is a rather curious design, but it is quite unique and easily beats out the legendary band pictures depicting the guys with loin cloths and swords held high, one of which was even put on the front cover of their second album \u201cInto Glory Ride\u201d.\n\nSince the 1980s were arguably the time when Manowar were at their creative peak and \u201cSign of the Hammer\u201d is an almost flawless album that may well be their best from that period, I would conclude that it also ranks as Manowar\u2019s best album ever \u2013 well, at least in my book. To sum it up briefly, this is a true metal classic and a must-have for every metalhead!\n",
        "\nBattle Hymns was Manowar's first studio album released in 1982. This was the remake that came out late last year under the title 'Battle Hymns MMXI'. Being the Manowar fan that I am, even I have to admit that their music production has been heading south lately. Its not because they are getting old, but simply because it feels like they are not trying like they used to anymore. The creative juices seemed to dry up as for the past 20 years and the time gaps between each cd release have been long, averaging 1 new album every 4-5 years. Production has been slow and rather than releasing a new studio album to offer something fresh, they decide to remake their first one.\n\nGenerally remakes are not nearly as good as the original. Battle Hymns MMXI is no exception. The riffs of this album have been tuned down an entire octave and it sounds a lot more rough than its predecessor. The deeper instruments match Eric's deeper vocals as he is now in his mid-50s and no longer in his 20s. I do not care what anyone says, but I believe that his voice has been aging quite gracefully. He can still hold those long and wicked high-note screams like he used to, which is good. I suppose its all about preference whether you enjoy the deeper and grungier tone they have taken with this remake, however I still think the up-beat and energetic hard rock style of the original is superior.\n\nI started off listening to the tracks in order. I started with Death Tone and made my way to Battle Hymn. Right off the bat it certainly sounds heavier than before. The main problem is most the songs sound a tad off-key from the original and some of the riffs (like in Death Tone) have been changed. I do not like this, mainly in Shell Shock. It sounds too off from the original cd almost to where the guitarist is drifting from what the song is and doing something else totally unrelated to Manowar. Such as the solos, they are all changed. This makes sense since the guitarist is Karl Logan and Not Ross the Boss. Its just,Ross had some skill and some soul in his playing. You can really tell he put some thought into his solos. Karl, on the other hand, is just mindless shredding. Not that its a bad thing, it just sounds only a fraction as good.\n\nThe only track on this cd that I found to come close to being on par with the original would be Dark Avenger. Since Orson Welles passed away 1985, Manowar had to get someone else to re-do the narration for the song, that being Christopher Lee, and I must say his dreaded and powerful voice really does the job for this remake. I still love the original, but this version of the song was even darker-toned and really gave the atmosphere of an unfairly treated soul and his journey to becoming the Dark Avenger.....then Karl Logan came in and ruined it with his mindless shredding at the end, but I digress.\n\nOverall, not a bad remake, just not a very good one. Muddier, deeper, and heavier than before. More heavy metal and less hard rock-sounding as one would say. What this band needs to do is rather than playing their old music with this new style, they should write new music using their old style. Come on, bring back the magic of 'Kings of Metal', 'Triumph of Steel', and 'Hail to England'. No one wants any more 'Gods of War'. Their recent ep, 'Thunder in the Sky', was a step in the right direction, now they just need a new album!\n",
        "\nIf you are objective, open minded, you will know how to appreciate this peace of art. It's standard Manowar, this time with massive orchestrations. This is totally natural thing since they were the ones who laid foundation for heavy metal's sub-genre called symphonic metal. It began with The Crown And The Ring (Lament Of The Kings), although that song doesn't have electric guitars. But still, it sounds so heavy, 'cause they are heavy metal enough even without distorted guitars. This release has lots of short introduction songs and some instrumental overtures done in classical music style, because of Richard Wagner's influence. If you know something about Manowar, then you noticed that these stories in The Blood Of Odin and Glory Majesty Unity are done in the vein of The Warrior's Prayer from Kings Of Metal album. So, they continued this epic story from 1988, and put it into this concept album, which consists of Norse Mythology, heavy metal, Manowar and their fans. Also, Warriors Of The World had short classical piece Valhalla and longer The March, so symphonic metal tendencies are not strange in Manowar's music.\n\nJoey DeMaio fully unveiled his artistic nature and showed his ability, creativity and talent to make classical music overtures: Overture To The Hymn Of The Immortal Warriors and Overture To Odin, introduction parts: The Ascension and beginning of Sleipnir as well, and epic stories: The Blood Of Odin and Glory Majesty Unity. These songs are the ones which turned this release into a concept album, since they don't have electric guitar, bass guitar and drums, but classical instruments and choir. When you remove these introductions, overtures and stories, instead of 16 songs, them 9 are songs where you can expect standard vocals, drums, bass and electric guitars. Parts where band members are notable in these classical songs are The Ascension, which is introduction for King Of Kings where Eric starts to sing, and Joey is narrator of The Blood Of Odin story. Army Of The Dead Part 1 features Eric, along with orchestrations and choir. Army Of The Dead Part 2 has identical lyrics, and the only difference is that Part 2 has keyboards (with organ effect) intro where Joey kicks serious ass. Some can consider these songs as filler, because if you look few years back, since The Triumph Of Steel, it takes them from 4, 5 to 6 years to release new studio albums. They toured a lot few years back, they had line-up changes, so it's natural that it takes lots of time to make new material, but lack of inspiration can't be ignored too.\n\nManowar is a band that needs time to release new studio albums, but once they come out, they can't disappoint. It's worth waiting, since they do not release crap garbage every year, but high quality heavy metal material. What really will blow away any serious listener are these killer songs. Eric played really important role here, and did impressive job. After all these years he was still capable to do high-pitched screams in King Of Kings, Loki God Of Fire, Die For Metal, Blood Brothers and in ending of the song Gods Of War. His voice filled these songs with insane amount of power, specially mind-blowing combination with strong chorus in songs Sons Of Odin and Gods Of War, where whole thing is taken to higher level, and with symphonic arrangements these two songs sound massive, epic and orgasmic. Hymn Of The Immortal Warriors received the same blessing, and it has even more epic feel when Joey starts the narration, and when he finishes, Eric starts along with choir which always make me shudder. Eric's intonation in Sleipnir's refrains is of key importance, otherwise song wouldn't sound that great. Karl Logan made excellent guitar solos. Slow, with lots of passion to fit the mood of Blood Brothers power ballad and Hymn Of Immortal Warriors, which sounds like a national anthem. Word \"hymn\" in the title makes perfect sense.\n\nSemi-furious, but technical solos are in Gods Of War, Odin and Die For Metal, and insanely furious solos full of arpeggios, sweeps and shredding in King Of Kings, with some slower parts, but with guitar rape in Sleipnir, and with use of tremolo to squeeze those notes. In Loki God Of Fire and Sons Of Odin he continued fast kick-ass playing. Odin has nice lead guitar which causes eargasm, and Loki God Of Fire has insane ending soloing along with Eric's singing, so you can't hear well some of his solo parts. It's refreshing to hear something like that, not just solos in the middle of the song without vocals. Although this release is not full of memorable riffs, Loki God Of Fire and Die For Metal have riffs which slay, and enough to leave great impression for the entire release. He placed power chords well in fast songs King Of Kings, Sleipnir, Loki God Of Fire, in mid tempo songs Sons Of Odin, Gods Of War and in slow songs Die For Metal, Blood Brothers and Hymn Of The Immortal Warriors. Joey's bass guitar is not dominant on this release, but he was dedicated to keyboards with organ effect and narrations in some parts of the songs. Scott Columbus could have done some different and more creative beats, instead of constant repeating the same pattern during the songs' durations. Songs still sound excellent, and other members covered this lack.\n\nGood sides of this release:\nThis is unique symphonic metal masterpiece. Unique because Joey and Karl have custom made equipment, their own Manowar distortion, there's only one Eric Adams and because orchestration here sounds totally different than any other band in heavy metal music did. Manowar proved they can set standards for symphonic metal, after years of classic heavy metal and power metal domination. This is really epic studio album, and word \"epic\" should be under their copyright hold.\n\nBad sides of this release:\nMay turn off lazy asses and narrow minded people who simply don't want to listen carefully and try to appreciate these excellent classical music parts.\n\nHighlights:\nEverything. If you listen from beginning to the end, it leaves even bigger impression.\n",
        "\nWhat a \"cheesy\" title one would think, but this title makes a perfect sense. From 80's in the USA where rock (hard rock mainly) bands were labeled as heavy metal (classic heavy metal), where suddenly thrash metal bands started to take control, and call everything that is not part of New Wave Of British Heavy Metal movement and thrash metal gay, where mallcore bands started to forge new \"groove\" trends in 90's, it's truly a triumph to put pure heavy metal record, specially if it belongs to its sub-genre power metal. Joey, Eric, David and Rhino didn't bow before the trends, which means no shitty drop tuned guitars, no growls, shouts, not mainly slow songs. This studio album is done not just to piss off the posers, but to continue the unique Manowar's style, and to carry on the flame of heavy metal music, which was infected by this mallcore disease (Pantera, Sepultura, Exorder, and all 80's thrash metal bands in general like Anthrax, Annihilator, Overkill and Sacred Reich which turned into \"groove\"). This release (just like Manowar itself) is far ahead of its time. The production, distortion, power, song's structures, everything sounds like it was made in 200(enter number).\n\nLast year, when I played Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy In Eight Parts (The Glory Of Achilles part) in front of my friend, he he asked me: \"Is this from their new album?\". That just confirms this fact. That song is a wonder of heavy metal music. 28:38 minutes in length, that explains everything. Of course length doesn't mean a shit if we talk about quality, but this one simply kicks ass with its amazing structure. It's made of 8 lesser songs, and each part fits this song. The whole song perfectly pictured Homer's Iliad, both musically and lyrically. Other bands can only wish to write lyrics like that, so myth about Manowar's cheesy lyrics is not true at all. This is really complex progressive metal package filled with power metal. So, music just fits these lyrics, when Achilles mourns his loss, you have epic slower part with choir, organ and some symphonic arrangements in order to complete epic atmosphere. When Achilles' armor is being forged comes the drum solo, where Rhino kicks some serious ass. When battle moments come, starts fast tempo, blazing riffs, insane Eric's vocals etc. Also, it has Joey's bass guitar solo (call it piccolo bass, I don't give a shit as long as he is awesome and unique), although it has some painful moments to listen.\n\nThat part is Desecration Of Hector's Body: Part 2. It's very simple: if you are not man enough to enjoy some loudness, heaviness and noise, combined with fast, technical, and tasty playing, you won't like Joey DeMaio. But even me, as a big fan of DeMaio, I think that part was too much. It's totally fine when he rapes his bass guitar while preforming live, because he wants to have some fun, but on studio release he had to be much more serious. I know he wanted to shred the fuck out of that instrument just to create picture of Achilles ripping Hector's dead body, but in a wrong way. Metal Warriors is kick-ass anthem-like anti-poser party heavy metal song. Anti-poser because of its lyrics, which are really well written. \"Every one of us has heard the call, brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall. We know the power within us has brought us to this hall, there's magic in the Metal, there's magic is us all\". What's cheesy about this part? It's simple, they announced show in a town, fans (brothers of True Metal) found out about that, and went there, the show starts inside the hall, magic is referred to their kick-ass performance. I could go on until tomorrow explaining the meaning of their lyrics to brainwashed hate-boys.\n\nSpirit Horse Of The Cherokee shows Manowar's ability to make a song about Native Americans, not just Vikings. Excellent lyrics, drum rhythm, notable bass guitar sound, slower raw riffs give excellent Native American ambient. The most amazing thing is when Eric starts to scream like a bad-ass Native American ready to rip off white man's heart and eat it up raw. With The Power Of Thy Sword they proved once again that they are really masters of making epic, long, intense songs with insane amount of power. Fantasy lyrics are right here in this song, not in other songs from this release, since others are based on historic events, literature, hellish dark forces and heavy metal brotherhood. In fact, there's one more song with fantasy lyrical content, it's called Ride The Dragon. Unfortunately that song is nothing special. Ride The Dragon and The Demon's Whip are the weakest songs from this studio album, and they belong to Manowar's repertoire of very few mediocre songs. Besides huge amount of power which comes from intense drum work Rhino did, Eric's fierce vocals and David's savage riffs, there's nothing actually special to make these songs excellent.\n\nRide The Dragon and The Demon's Whip's ending part have structure like Death Hector's Revenge and The Glory Of Achilles (from Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy In Eight Parts). Drums and riffs tend to make the same feel, but it didn't work well. And constantly repeating the same thing isn't much exciting. Because of this, this studio album can be easily classified as Manowar's weakest effort. Burning and Master Of The Wind are really unique and amazing songs. Nothing I've ever heard of before. Burning's mysterious ambient which consist of mid tempo and some slower parts where Eric talks with eerie tone, ending screams, raw, heavy riffs, nice rough bass lines, solo full of shredding, squeals and sweeps and great drum work take you to the depths of Hell, where masculine demons wait to feast with sinners' souls. Master Of The Wind stands at the end as the most tranquil song. It's full of lyrical wisdom, nice acoustic ambient, and Eric once again showed his amazing vocal performance.\n\nGood sides of this release:\nOnce again excellent job done by this the most heavy metal band ever. All band members played very important role here. Joey's bass is very dominant, Rhino destroyed the drums, Eric did outstanding job, and David fits well here. I still prefer Ross The Boss over David Shankle, because Ross had more heavy metal feel than David, although David served Manowar well, specially on live shows. He performed live like insane. It's great thing that he was featured on this studio album only, because after him came Karl Logan who is like a mix of Ross' heavy metal feel and David's technical playing. So, this is another strong release, and it continued the series of excellent studio albums. It's recommended for every metalhead who wants to feel heavy metal fury unleashed.\n\nBad sides of this release:\nLack of creativity in songs Ride The Dragon and The Demon's Whip, but they are still good (3/5) songs.\n\nHighlights:\nAchilles, Agony And Ecstasy In Eight Parts, Metal Warriors, Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee, Burning, The Power Of Thy Sword and Master Of The Wind.\n",
        "\nFor many friends of mine, this record has been their first contact to metal music and was the spark of ignition that enlightened their passion for this kind of music. Back in the days, the title track of the record and the amazing \"I Believe\" that didn't make it on the album and was only included on the amazing single \"The Dawn Of Battle\" had a lot of radio and television airplay and underlined the reborn popularity of metal music in the beginning of the last decade.\n\nWhen I First got in touch with the record I was impressed by the epic feeling of many songs, the catchy choruses and the raw energy of the lyrics, the symbolism and the show of the band. Today, I have a different point of view and must admit that the band didn't develop a lot musically, lyrically or culturally in a gap of six years between two studio albums. The lyrics are though largely influenced by the terrorist attacks the year before this record came out and feels a little bit too patriotic and cheesy at some points in tracks like \"The Fight For Freedom\" even though this song is at least musically one of the more addicting ones on here. This fact doesn't change much as the lyrics are so limited that they always sound the same no matter if the band sings about a medieval battle, about being true metal martyrs or about current political events. That's why Manowar should simply not touch this kind of topic as it is way too serious for their kind of slapstick lyrics. On the other hand, we don't need oversized drama lyrics from Iced Earth on their \"The Glorious Burden\" output. These bands should simply concentrate on their strength and play great metal music as political and art don\u2019t mix very well. \n\nApart of the exception I just mentioned, Manowar fail at several points on this record to concentrate on accurate song writing. The instrumental \"Valhalla\" is quite valueless as well as the overlong piece of classic music which is \"The March\". The patriotic \"An American Trilogy\" and the Italian opera excerpt \"Nessun Dorma\" are two cover versions that are well done without reaching the majesty of the originals. Eric Adams is one of the most gifted singers in the metal universe and it's touching that he dedicates a track to his late mother and also the Italian fans but he definitely is no Luciano Pavarotti or Elvis Presley on the other hand. His performance on the record sounds fresh while the drumming sounds a little bit too basic at some points, the guitars deliver the usual goods and even the usually great bass guitar is less impressive as it has already been in the past.\n\nWhat's left is a bunch of energizing but sometimes quite similar metal tracks that represent everything Manowar stands for without being as unique and groundbreaking as the band's earlier battle hymns. The strongest tracks are the angry and epic opener \"Call To Arms\" that works very well live but this track could have been cut down by a few minutes. \"Warriors Of The World United\" is a simplistic but definitely unforgettable metal hymn that any metal maniac in the world should know by heart and must not hide between the simple and brutal catchiness of classics like \"Hail And Kill\" or \"Gloves Of Metal\". The more brutal and straight forward \"Hand Of Doom\" is also a great neck breaker that should please to all fans of the band and reminds me of the band's earlier days.\n\nIn the end, this album is filled with light and shade. There are many instrumental fillers, covers and faceless tracks but also a few interesting experiments and energizing metal hymns. If the band would have put the songs from the \"Dawn Of Battle\" single on this record there would have been more quality than quantity on this album. As this isn't the case, this album is only situated somewhere between shallow mediocrity and good average. It's fun to listen to this record from time to time but nothing too memorable. For its nostalgic importance for many friends of mine and the fact that there is no track I have sung and head banged to as this record's title track, I might add a few points. Apart of the title track, you should really keep your money and buy the beautifully made \"Dawn Of Battle\" single instead. Honestly said this random album already announced the band's lack of ideas that would lead to the megalomaniac boredom they released with \"Gods Of War\". The band had surpassed its zenith and should have gathered all possible forces to release a strong last record but they failed to do this and leave as heroes of heavy metal music. If you want to discover the hevay metal universe or the best stuff from Manowar you should rather stick to one of the six first records and leave this one alone.\n",
        "\nManowar returns and does it like others times: amazingly. With \"Call To Arms\", \u200b\u200bthe opening song of the album, they prepare our ears for a new session of almost 50 minutes of pure emotion using epic letters and several symphonic songs, extolling the spirit of the group and encourages us the spirit. Let's say that the songs can be separated into two groups with one group containing songs about war and the other made \u200b\u200bup of those most instrumental and soft. As we hear the album we can see a continuous exchange of both groups from the beginning, because when \"Call To Arms\" ends, \"The Fight for Freedom\" begins with slow melody and emotion and with lyrics deep and precious (honestly, it\u00b4s one of the best songs on Warriors of The World). But we can also hear songs that include the best of each group as is the case of \"Nessun Dorma\". Here, Eric Adams (lead singer) makes a heavy version of this known opera and in the end, the rest of the group incorporates and add metal\u00b4s energy to the composition (all do excellently). Surprisingly, we also enjoy an instrumental song that is different from the rest of the album because it\u00b4s a classical music composition and, only from the second half, it acquires an emphasis on epic that links it to the global nature of the disc. \n\nPersonally, I prefer Gods Of War, but I must admit that I love Warriors Of The World (the album chronologically prior to the Gods Of War) and I think that any lover of heavy metal should listen to this at least once in life.\n\nWritten by newmusicalearth.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nThis is one of my favorite albums and maybe even the best in the department of epic metal!\n\nI like Manowar. They are not exactly my favorite band but I like most of their stuff and give their other albums a spin once in a while. But this is different. The album that comes closest to this in respect of epic feel is Into Glory Ride. But not only has this been released nearly ten years later and therefore has a much better production, but this is also so much better content-wise! Don\u00b4t get me wrong, I think IGR is one of the better Manowar releases, but this is just in another league. You won\u00b4t find any stuff like most songs off Louder than Hell or the first halves of Fighting the World and Battle Hymns on here. Just one track (Metal Warriors) falls in this department. \n\nThe production on this album has the effect to make the instruments seem rather physical. I don\u00b4t know how to explain this in a better way. This album is also the most extreme done by Manowar. In some parts it gets pretty aggressive, for example, in the finale of The Demon\u00b4s Whip...man, I think Manowar never did something this extreme on another record. The combination of the very epic feel, the aggressiveness, and the incredible voice of Eric Adams make this one of the or maybe the best album in its genre.\n\nEric sounds like a real warrior of ancient times in a fantasy world. This we know also from their other albums. But here he often screams in a very aggressive yet melodic style. I think besides Painkiller-era Halford, this is a voice that could be taken to define heavy metal. Unfortunately, these screams won\u00b4t be heard on any later records from the band. I think that maybe Eric's voice has just been used up while recording this album.\n\nThe drumming is great with a lot of use of the double bass drum that adds to the `warrior in a battle` feeling. The guitar solos are kind of unique on here. I don\u00b4t know a comparison to this. They are very confused yet not nontechnical. I think they fit in perfectly and contribute to the physical feel mentioned before. This feeling is also what separates this from other great epic albums like Virgin Steele's House of Atreus, Blind Guardian's Imaginations From the Other Side and Iced Earth's Burnt Offerings and makes Triumph of Steele more an actual journey through another world and not just a tale about it. \n\nHighlights are the incredible screaming voice of Eric Adams and the great songs on here. These are Hector Storms the Wall, Hector\u00b4s Final Hour, Death Hector\u00b4s Reward, Ride the Dragon, The Power of thy Sword, The Demon\u00b4s Whip and Master of the Wind. The latter is a ballad and probably the best song on here as it conveys a really great epic feeling. In no way can Heart of Steel can compete with this!\n\nBUY THIS!!! I you like epic metal, you at least need this. The absolute highlight of Manowar's catalog!\n",
        "\n1982: Let's imagine Manowar at this point in their lives: \nBassist and mastermind; Joey DeMaio, 28, desperate to make his mark in the metal world, head swirling with lofty aspirations. Frontman; Eric Adams, also 28, easily spouting Ian Gillan-isms yet hungry to be recognized as a singular vocal talent. Ross \"the Boss\" Friedman, 28, eager to annihilate yet still very much restrained and Donnie Hamzik, just a hired hand? (He didn't return for \"Into Glory Ride\" released just eleven months later). \nYou'll have to pardon my highfalutin-bordering-on-comic sketch of the guys but Manowar have always been prime candidates for the hatchet. And we all know they had lofty ideals-hell, they signed their contract with Liberty Records in blood and have since gone on record as the loudest band.\n\nFor all their ambition however, \"Battle Hymns\" yields to the traditional form of heavy metal and the epic le grand \"Dark Avenger\" (complete with Orson Welles' cinematic narration) aside, there isn't much variety. And yet this conformity to tradition-delivered so rawly and urgently-is what makes the album such a wow and essential listening. \nJoey DeMaio is showy but not overbearing and his lyrics are not lost in a sea of futile speech. The \"call to arms\" tone and message in \"Battle Hymn\" still sounds vital to this day as a part of the Manowar Experience while the wit and leery charm of \"Fast Taker\" cannot be denied by all in possession of a sense of humour.\n\nThis is \"Vanquishing Metal\" at its best. Eric sounds inciting and tireless on every song, forcefully bringing the full intent and meaning behind every word. Although later this would mean his intonation leaves little to the imagination, here it is all grist to the mill. And if you still think it is overdone - I kindly beg you to have a little perspective. After all, this is Manowar's first full on assault. \nRoss The Boss does not let himself be overshadowed by Joey in the rhythm department but it is for his fiery leads that he'll be most remembered on this album and Donnie Hamzik does a good job but Scott Columbus (R.I.P) did an even better one on the follow up \"Into Glory Ride\" where the ideas planted here were fully germinated.\n\nWhat does \"Battle Hymns\" mean to us this day? Well, it shows a band accused of excess at their leanest , playing with such heart and such sonic thunder, and with an urgency that would be severely lessened for most of their career. The close they came to playing such vital metal in their post-\"Hail To England\" days is a few songs on \"Warriors Of The World\". \nBut enough with the gloom, here is material tinged with agelessness. An album worth re-discovering . \nThe guys unwittingly created a masterpiece! Enjoy it for all its intentions and what it truly delivers.\n",
        "\nThis was a bad idea, this was always a bad idea, it's a bad bad bad bad idea by a band that is up there with Anthrax in terms of \"creative bankruptcy\". Battle Hymns for me is a rarity; a classic, unashamedly rocky album that I not only 'appreciate for it's influence' (blah blah blah wank) but genuinely love, one that I can listen to, and do listen to very very often. It's definitely one of my top 10 albums, it is fucken good, I love it, I want to whisper sweet nothings to it while I tenderly enter it, etc etc.\n\nBut it's not an album that can take a rerecording. The original was one of a kind, Adams' whacked and really youthful vocals, the cluttered as hell mix that nevertheless worked brilliantly, the all over the place guitar solos, and the energy. The energy, the key point of the album, what made the original sound so good, and the lack of which makes this stink so much. Battle Hymns '82 was obviously recorded by a bunch of very young dudes who as my seedy, definitely-not-gay co-worker would say were \"young dumb and full of cum\". And it works! Battle Hymns moreso than any other Manowar album was the one where there drunken, cheerful hyper-masculinity worked the whole way through, \n\nBut that was '82 and this is/was 28 years later. Manowar aren't the young bucks they used to be, Adams isn't the singer he used to be (anything with a scream on it is pretty painful to hear), Logan sure as shit isn't Ross the Boss, so on and so forth. Metal Daze is a serious disappointment, surely with all these fancy production values you could get a decent \"HEAVY METAL\" bit for the chorus? No? Oh well. Fast Taker, long part of my \"lose my voice trying to do screams\" playlist, has a serious lack of screams, and energy, and the guitar solo is crap, so on and so forth. Well, it's not crap, Logan isn't rubbish but he is tight and controlled; which sucks as a huge part of the first Battle Hymns were the sloppy, super fast and all over the place solos and here they don't exist, which also leads to some huge disappointment in the title track. And most of the tracks, basically. Don't get me started on Dark Avenger, where the frenzied final speed metal section of the original version becames a staid, safe procession. Or the production, which for all of it's million-dollar vibe has a few clear mixing errors with the vocals and a serious problem with dynamics or lack thereof. \n\nUgh man i'm disappointed with this. Well, I'm not disappointed, as this is pretty much what I was expecting, I guess I'm sad this even exists. I'm sad Eric sounds like an old man and can't hit high notes. I'm sad that they kept the bass solo in here. That the whole thing reeks of \"tired old men cashing in\" instead of the youthful hunger and independence that the original stood for. I'm sad that the rockier songs turned into boring plodathons. In the end, it's a more depressing album than you may think, lots of \"end of youth\", \"end of idealism\" things you could twist out of this, for sure.\n\nHere's to Metallica never rerecording Ride the Lightning!\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve listened something new by Manowar that I felt was worthwhile and made me really want to head-bang as hard as my neck allows it. To be honest, I think the Kings of Metal haven\u2019t produced anything even mildly interesting for the past decade, all of the releases from said period being just ornaments to add to their stagnant discography. 2002\u2019s Warriors of the World is not a bad record, but pales in comparison to all of their previous releases. And lets not speak about the pompous fiasco that was 2007\u2019s Gods of War. However, the gods seem to have re-empowered the metal veterans with renewed strength and determination. This EP heralds what seems to be an age of rebirth for Manowar.\n\nFor the Thunder in the Sky EP, Manowar got rid of most of the overtly cheesy and pretentious elements of Gods of War and reversed their style back to basics. No, you won\u2019t find (many) overblown symphonic elements nor dull narrations here, just the thunder of well-muscled guitars, bass, drums and the still potent voice of Eric Adams clashing with each other. All of the six \u201cnew\u201d songs here display a power and groove worthy of praise. The production is excellent, clear and loud as it needs to be, and don\u2019t let the lackluster artwork fool you, this is classic Manowar all the way.\n\nThis EP start with the mighty title-track, a speedy rocker with a steady double bass rhythm that reminds me of Grave Digger, though probably the germans were the ones influenced by Manowar, and not the other way around. Anyway, this is a hell of a song, fully packed with memorable riffs and an even more memorable chorus. Its 100% classic Manowar, from solos to lyrics, though they sound modern and I might even dare to say, rejuvenated. All of the instruments are performed more than efficiently here, and this song alone is reason enough to give this EP a chance.\n\nTrack no.2 is \u201cLet the Gods Decide\u201d, and it seems they decided to give Manowar a chance to reclaim their glory of old. Another great song of this EP, this hard-rocking number is a bit slower than the opener but that doesn\u2019t mean one just won\u2019t listen to this while steadily headbanging and giving it the horns. The vocal lines along with the solid yet simple riffs continue to be the focal point both extremely enjoyable and first-class. The first time I listened to this EP I just couldn\u2019t believe it was this good after listening to only its first couple of songs. I mean, it couldn\u2019t be THIS good, right? Right?! \u2026Wrong! It is.\n\nWell to be honest track no. 3, the ballad \u201cFather\u201d is the weak point of Thunder in the Sky, being a bit cheesy, typical of a Manowar ballad. But that doesn\u2019t mean is not enjoyable, taking it for what it is. Besides, one has to give credit to the band, and especially to Eric Adams, for singing the fifteen different-language versions of the bonus disc. I don\u2019t know about most of them, but at least for the french and spanish versions I can assure you, they are pretty well sung and adapted, with a fairly decent pronunciation. As a fan, I must say there\u2019s no other thing to do but applaud to them. Few bands have this kind of gesture to their fans. Horns up!\n\n\u201cDie With Honor\u201d is next, their latest single in edited form, and so far, it\u2019s the only version of that song we\u2019ve heard. After an almost a cappella intro it soon transforms into a middle-paced number with epic, anthemic feel (and lyrics), and an excellent masculine choral intervention backed up by pounding rhythms, like those of marching warriors advancing to meet their fate on the battleground. The contemplative bridge section is like the calm before those warriors plunge into the storm of the skirmish. The chorus says it all, really:\n\nFight with blood! Fight with steel!\nDie with honor, never yield!\nFearless hearts, filled with pride!\nInto Glory we shall ride!\n\nNext we have the \u201cmetal version\u201d of \u201cThe Crown and the Ring\u201d, a song from the Kings of Metal album, actually one of my favorites from that album, itself one of my least favorite Manowar releases. If you were expecting a heavier or speedier rendition of this song, (which is just what I imagined, because you know, it\u2019s supposed to be the \u201cmetal version\u201d) you\u2019ll be disappointed, but not too much. This version is not very different from the original, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s an overall improvement. The keyboards are way better, creating a full epic symphonic atmosphere, replacing the lame 80\u2019s keys. The choruses are also meatier, like the ones in the previous song of this EP. It\u2019s like Manowar waited for the technology to develop enough, enabling them to perfect this song to the standards they desired when it was originally conceived.\n\nAnd finally, we have the strong closer that is \u201cGod or Man\u201d, another speedy, double-bass driven track, that ends this EP in magnificent way. The riff work is not as memorable as on the first songs of this EP, but the chorus and solos make up for it. It drags a bit at the end, but is a song worthy of bearing Manowar\u2019s name.\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of EP\u2019s, but this is definitively worth its price, especially if you are a fan of epic power, speed or classic metal. Also, if you\u2019re pretty new to classic heavy metal, or haven\u2019t listened to Manowar before, this could be a fine introduction, but you should mandatorily check out this great band\u2019s older releases as well. For me this is also a step into the right direction, and I\u2019m looking forward their next album. I might even check the re-recorded Battle Hymns album, hoping it was (re)made with the same passion as Thunder in the Sky.\n",
        "\nAlthough I am a huge fan of Manowar's early work, I must confess that the band's latest releases were kind of disappointing. Both \u201cWarriors Of The World\u201d and \u201cGods Of War\u201d, despite having some bright moments, were not nearly as good as the material on albums like \u201cHail To England\u201d, \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d or \u201cTriumph Of Steel\u201d. That being said, it is easy to understand why I did not expect much from their newest EP, \u201cThunder In The Sky\u201d. The news that they would include a ballad in 16 languages on the album brought my expectations even lower, since their last ballads were really horrible.\n\nSo, I was gladly surprised by style the band adopted in this \u201cThunder In The Sky\u201d EP. Gone are the endless intros, narrations and interludes from \u201cGods Of War\u201d. On the new songs, there is also no trace of the symphonic elements that infested \u201cWarriors Of The World\u201d. What we have here is the purest heavy metal that everyone has always expected from the so called Kings Of Metal.\n\nThree of the four new songs, \u201cThunder In The Sky\u201d, \u201cLet The Gods Decide\u201d and \u201cGod Or Man\u201d could be easily in any of their earlier albums. They may not be as brutal or fast as the material on \u201cTriumph of Steel\u201d, but they are heavy and straightforward, and have nice choruses and excellent performances by all the members. \n\nHowever, the other new song, the aforementioned ballad \u201cFather\u201d, sucks big time. Cheesy and mellow, it sucks in all 16 languages it was recorded and does not come even close to the band\u2019s best ballads, such as \u201cHeart Of Steel\u201d and \u201cMaster Of The Wind\u201d.\n\nAlso included in this EP is the song \u201cDie With Honor\u201d, that had already been played live and released as a single, and a new version of the classic song \u201cThe Crown And The Ring\u201d, from the \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d album. The first is a heavy metal anthem just like \u201cMetal Warriors\u201d and \u201cWarriors Of The World United\u201d, with a killer chorus made to be sung with fists up in the air. The second, although not as good as the original version, is still a terrific song, by far their best attempt at doing something symphonic. The guitars are a bit heavier on this version, and Eric Adam's voice is still amazing.\n\nAll in all, \u201cThunder In The Sky\u201d is a return to form to the Kings Of Metal. It is really good to see them playing more straightforward metal, and if the next album comes along the lines of this EP, I am sure it will be much better than their last couple of releases.\n",
        "\nA word to the wise: Even good bands can pump out really lame material sometimes. Just because you like a band does not mean you are obligated to never criticize them. And just because you wear spandex, sing about fire and steel and have long blonde hair\u2026it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re really better than anybody else playing Heavy Metal music. Yeah. Yeah, that about sums up Kings of Metal.\n\nI mean\u2026I like Manowar, and I don\u2019t even hate this album; not really. But I just can\u2019t bring myself to give this a higher score. How can you possibly fuck something like this up? It should be easy \u2013 write a bunch of cheesy, fast songs, some heavy riffs and some slower anthems. And, you know, do not put in anything like obnoxious bass solos, pretentious orchestral ballads and even songs that have no music at all and just deep-voiced narration. That would just be stupid, but then, that\u2019s exactly what they did. I guess it\u2019s supposed to be part of their theatrical nature or something, but I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care. It is poor writing, and no amount of lovable attitude and charisma can save that.\n\nI just never understand why Manowar assumes anyone wants to hear shit like this. A bass solo? And one that\u2019s based off of a classical piece? The pointlessness just\u2026jumps off the record and hits me in the face. And the narration piece \u201cThe Warrior\u2019s Prayer\u201d\u2026why? Why do we need to hear this? Who ever looked at an album like Sign of the Hammer and said to the band \u201chey, that wasn\u2019t bad, but your next album needs a four minute interlude with no guitars, just narration that nobody will really care about. That will make sure that nobody enjoys it too much.\u201d Bullshit! Well, maybe the rest of the songs are just so good that they would justify such random, whimsical fucking around. Maybe they\u2019re just so damned cool that I will be forced to reiterate my opinion on this piece of work and analyze it from a more open-minded point of view. Maybe they\u2019ll just blow my fucking mind out of the water. So, how are they?\n\n\u2026it\u2019s about half and half. For one, we do get some really good songs like \u201cWheels of Fire,\u201d \u201cHeart of Steel\u201d and \u201cHail and Kill,\u201d three all-time Manowar classics. \u201cHeart of Steel\u201d in particular is just lovely, a stirring, manly anthem of warrior-like proportions with a delicate piano backdrop and some truly great, charismatic vocals from Eric Adams, who completely steals the show here. Great, great song. And \u201cHail and Kill\u201d and \u201cWheels of Fire\u201d are just overflowing with cheese, manifestos of metallic might indeed. The title track is okay, catchy enough, and \u201cBlood of the Kings\u201d is seven minutes of shredding Virgin Steele-esque guitar acrobatics and wailing that, yeah, I have to admit is cool. But we also get songs like the entirely forgettable \u201cKingdom Come\u201d (might be good if it was longer and had a better chorus\u2026), the wussy waste of time \u201cThe Crown and the Ring\u201d and the nadir of entertainment itself, \u201cPleasure Slave.\u201d Yes, this song was apparently not released on the original press of the album, but was added at a later date because apparently the band decided this album didn\u2019t have enough suck in it already, and what do you know? It sucks. The riffs are half assed, none of them seem to go together, the vocals are annoyingly unmemorable and the sound effects aren\u2019t even that funny or anything. It just completely sucks, and I don\u2019t see why anyone would want to listen to it.\n\nIn fact, you know what this is? I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m completely off on this, but I just get the impression that Manowar just recorded a bunch of stuff they thought was cool or funny, without actually tying it together into a cohesive album. They just felt like screwing around in the studio and then decided that their fans would like a cobble of random ass shit that they could have just as easily relegated to EP status, or even just kept in the studio, never to see the light of day. It\u2019s just so half-cocked, all of it. They could have at least given us a concept album or integrated the oddities better into the songs. And they could have at least written better songs in general.\n\nAnd one more thing; what the hell is up with the production? It\u2019s tinny, it\u2019s weak, it sounds like it was recorded in a goddamn cardboard box. The guitar tone is a sniveling waste of energy, the drums sound like the rat-tat-tat of a pencil on a desk and nothing jumps out at me at all; it\u2019s all kind of condensed into this weak streamline of dullness. You would think a band man enough to call themselves the Kings of Metal would get a heavier production job. Lame.\n\nThis album isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s just got so many things desperately trying to make it uncool that it\u2019s really hard to enjoy. I understand the band isn\u2019t taking themselves all that seriously, but there\u2019s a difference between comically goofy, zany stuff and plain old half-assed crap. Half the songs suck, the production is lame and there\u2019s no flow between tracks at all. Seriously, I listen to music to, uh, HEAR THE MUSIC, and this album puts the stop on the metal too much for my taste, considering how much the band wants us to know how metal they are. The good songs are good enough to warrant listening to this album, but you\u2019ll probably have your finger on the skip button a lot of the time. I do not hate Kings of Metal, but really, guys? Really?\n\nThat about sums up my reaction to this album.\n",
        "\nKings of Metal is a completely goofy jumble of poppy stuff, and objectively, it should fall apart at the seams. But it doesn't. And while, objectively, it should be annoying as hell in its poppiness and cheesy contrived character, it's not. What it is, however, is something Igor collected and Herr Doktor assembled. It's not pretty, but it's catchier than Ebola and powerful enough to tip over a 2005 Smart Roadster. Igor collected some mighty fine parts on his nightly treks, it's Herr Doktor's aesthetic eye that failed... but no worries, that's a classical origin for a good story!\n\nA quick census on the tracklist is quite enough to show the impossibility of finding any logic on the album. On the european CD version, with the annoying \"Pleasure Slave\" included, the progression of the tracklist follows a path not unlike the EKG of a middle-aged man in the throes of a \"widowmaker\" class cardiac arrest:\n\nTraditional metal song \n-> Hard rock tune \n-> Extra cheesy anthemic masterpiece \n-> Silly bass instrumental completely unconnected to the rest of the album \n-> Another extra cheesy anthemic masterpiece \n-> Heavy metal tune with an unsuccessful dash of epic \n-> Annoying attempt at appearing sexy/controversial \n-> Excellent heavy metal piece \n-> Annoying spoken story, theoretically worth two listens several decades apart \n-> Traditional metal tune...\n\nYup, someone forgot to take his ADHD medication. This album bounces around completely devoid of logic, any kind of comprehensible story, or creative restraint whatsoever. It goes wherever it feels like going, and appears to be a kind of contraption build from the contents of the \"discards\" box in the corner of the room; the only common theme is the mild reek of cheese lingering in the room, and a culinarist into this kind of cuisine is absolutely thrilled. Rearranging the tracks might have resulted in a more logical entity, by simply placing the anthemic stuff on one side; remember, this is a product of the late vinyl age. However, that would also have created a divided album, and most people would probably only listen to one of the sides. There would be the cheesy, anthemic side with \"Heart of Steel\", \"Crown and the Ring\", \"Hail and Kill\" and \"The Warrior's Prayer\", and another cheesy, rocking metal side with the rest of the tracks. And the choice would be yours: which one to love and which one to forget completely?\n\n\"The Warrior's Prayer\" takes the cake among the cheesier parts on the album, and lacks any replay value... until you run into a person who has heard it several hundred times, and recites it word-for-word after seven pints while you wait for a gig to start... And suddenly, behold! There's a crowd of a dozen people around, all paying more attention than they should, having overheard the familiar words, some of them timidly joining the recital, only to disperse among the gig audience once the story is over and the short moment of unity has passed. While there's every reason to say that the album would be much better without it, the tale does have its own kind of Cheddar-smelling value. \n\nThe other oddities on the album are \"Sting of the Bumblebee\" and \"Pleasure Slave\". \"Bumblebee\" is one of those wheels of cheese that end up on albums all across the metal spectrum, despite the fact that they have absolutely NO connecting factors whatsoever with the rest of the songs, only because they seem so utterly brilliant and totally \u00fcber-cool when they are recorded, and simply can't be left out, man. It has the sting of Stilton emanating from it, fortunately. \"Pleasure Slave\", on its turn, tries and fails in what Ter\u00e4sbetoni's \"Orjatar\" and Spinal Tap's \"Sex Farm Woman\" (especially the soul version found on Back from the Dead) succeed in doing. It lacks the necessary dosage of Roquefort, and doesn't appear either anthemic, funny, or self-parody: it just fails, and the fact that it's essentially a bonus track proves the band originally agreed, at least on some level.\n\nIf the three oddities and misteps of the album are half failure and half brilliance, the basic metal tracks are reliable stuff, and \"Hail and Kill\" and \"Kingdom Come\" even manage to be bloody good. They do smell of Gouda, of course, but not of the supermarket variety. No, these pieces of coagulated udder sweat have been stored in great, chilly halls in a castle on a mountain, and brushed weekly with red wine by a brotherhood of warrior-cheesemaker monks, until their crusts are of the finest royal purple and pleasurable to caress. Maybe \"Blood of the Kings\" slips into singing praise to the scene, and perhaps \"Kings of Metal\" could sound more like the metal it is in its core, than the hard rock its crust resembles, but they still deliver good, basic Manowar. With cheese.\n\nAnd finally, the finest of the fine, the anthems that reek of Limburger, flow like Camembert in room temperature, and have the fine texture of an aged black label Emmental. \"Heart of Steel\" is one of a handful of songs ever written that actually works based on vocals and piano alone in the context of a metal album, even if only partially, and the restraint the band shows once it turns into an actual anthem is remarkable. \"Crown and the Ring\" is the equivalent of Old Chimay trappist cheese, and with its characteristic pseudo-choral arrangement, combined with the pipe organ sound and almost symphonic spices, creates a feel of a great hall in a cathedral of the protective saints of cheesemakers.\n\nYes, even if the cardboard box has been damaged by moisture, and needs a crapload of duct tape to hold all the assorted cheeses inside, it still stays together, and holds a special place in the minds of a lot of metalheads who found their true calling in the latter half of the 80s. The cheeses in the box have been designed for maximum financial gain, and the makers have obviously aimed for optimized mixture of radio-friendly songs and memorable anthems. What they created was Frankenstein's Roquefort Golem, a laboring and insane construction showing no trace of intelligent design, little purpose, and made of tons of living cheese. Just a few bits and bites are bad, and the towering colossus seems to work, against all odds and logic.\n\nPerhaps the years and memories have grown fine, blue veins of Penicillium glaucum onto Kings of Metal, and the sheer force of nostalgia makes the mind like this album more than it should deserve. Perhaps it really is the mosty commercial piece of metal ever produced. But... whatever! It never slips into industrial processed cheese, and all of it is manufactured by manual labour. For the old rats, this is a bait that draws them close to the stereo, and it seems to work across the field of metal. If you wish to try it, just learn \"The Warrior's Prayer\" by heart, and start reciting it word-for-word on a gig with metalheads in their 30s in the audience. If you don't get at least a few approving smiles, you must live in a place where cheese itself is illegal.\n\nDon't take Manowar too seriously; it's highly likely that Manowar does not take Manowar too seriously.\n",
        "\nThough the cover to Manowar's 10th studio full-length album has something to appeal to those of any sexuality, I have spent the past two years burdened with a question that burns my mind and threatens the delicate balance of the universe...\n\nWho gets the fifth chick, Manowar?\n\nWho does she belong to? Odin? Thor? Does the band split her, or are they all 'community' to be shared, and thus the unbalanced numbers mean for naught. I may never know the answer to this. For all I know, none of the men and women adorning this album cover have any interest in those of the opposite sex.\n\nTits, ass and pectorals aside, Gods of War was a pretty daring dash to restore the faith of the band's massive fandom and re-enter a world loaded with spastic, corny power metal bands like Dragonforce who are amusingly even more dorky than the Kings. The ninth album, Warriors of the World, may have had a herald or two of memorable material sure to fire up the band's live sets, but they had been producing fairly mediocre (and fully overrated) work since the great year of 1984. Oh, fans will laud every accolade possible upon the ironic, iconic figureheads, but let's face facts. A lot of the band's charm of the early 80s was lost in cut and paste self-tributes to sate a rather numb crowd, hyped on Budweiser and cocaine and the steam of their own wind. Gods of War goes quite a distance to restore this, but you will have to dig a little, beyond the overinflated narrative of the album, which will probably have you in stitches.\n\nFor instance, you might have to look beyond the title to the pompous opening track, \"Overture to the Hymn of the Immortal Warriors\", and also the rather lackluster, symphonic music which is more fitting for a carousel than a head banging. Oh yeah, it's SIX FUCKING MINUTES LONG. And when it ends, and you're ready for the guitars to rip and Eric Adams to scream and blow your mind and cherry out...you get NOTHING. You get another 2:30 minute symphonic piece titled \"The Ascension\", though at least Adams sings on it. And then, at long last, \"King of Kings\", which is so much different than \"Kings of Metal\", you get a pretty standard Manowar number, with choppy guitars that pummel alongside a steady rockin' beat and Adams' dirty mid range. \"Army of the Dead Part I\" is another intro with Adams soaring across it, and \"Sleipnir\" has even more of the goofy narrative, but at least it ends in a little metal thunder.\n\nWith \"Loki God of Fire\", we get the first worthwhile Manowar song, splitting the sky with some burnin' rhythms and a nice little break in the bridge, with some speed pickin'. \"Blood Brothers\" is a power ballad, but it's hardly offensive, as Adams can carry such a song and have every lighter swaying and male or female zipper longing to burst. \"Overture of Odin\" is more symphony. \"The Blood of Odin\" is MORE symphony, with narrative. \"Sons of Odin\", well that's a metal track, with a plodding bass, great solos, and some powerful (if cheesy) anthemic vocal melodies. \"Glory Majesty Unity\" is another symp...alright, fuck it.\n\nThese are the remaining metal songs on this album: \"Gods of War\" is huge and totally lame, but I wound up smiling anyway, because they build such a glorious cornball atmosphere that I'm surprised Meat Loaf doesn't bust out in the middle with some of his howling. \"Odin\", just Odin, mind ye, and the fourth track on the album to contain the name Odin, is one of the better tracks here, though the band seems afraid to really pick up the pace. \"Hymn of the Immortal Warriors\" is part bombast, but does evoke a little metal near the climax. Bonus track \"Die for Metal\" is totally lame and totally awesome, suck on that Hammerfall! Of course, it's only considered a bonus track because it isn't part of the Gods of War concept, which is to libate Odin and Thor and every other generic Norse concept, hammering them into stupidity. And of course, it cannibalizes their own past lyrics song titles, but it does at least rock.\n\n'They said hold your head up high\nRaise your fist up in the air\nPlay Metal louder than Hell\nLouder than Hell'\n\nManowar devotees are so blindly obedient that the band is far beyond criticism. As for the rest of us, you can probably enjoy this album if you:\n\n1. Shut off your brain.\n2. Forget all standards (should happen as a result of #1).\n3. Have a ready supply of beer and/or cocaine.\n4. Stop wondering about that fifth nekkid broad on the cover.\n\nHighlights: bound to occur whenever the 'Kings of Metal' get the brilliant idea to actually play metal\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI've often been critical of Manowar, as I've long considered them both the best and worst practical joke metal music has ever conceived. Unfortunately, the joke is on myself and everyone who has ever questioned them, because metal is decades old now and the absurd stereotypes propagated by Manowar and their peers now dominate the world's mindview of our beloved music, which has been a huge hindrance to its acceptance in culture.\n\nBut you know what? Fuck culture. And fuck me. Manowar doesn't give a damn. They love what they do and they have never stopped doing it, regardless of the changing extremity of the genre's landscape around them. And believe it or not, there was a time where I eagerly awaited the band's albums, since they were pretty spotless in the early phase of their career. 1984 was a busy year for the metal gods, releasing two great efforts. Sign of the Hammer was the inferior of the two (I prefer Hail to England, only slightly), but it is not without some impressive, memorable tracks of its own.\n\nWho can ever forget \"All Men Play on 10\"? As corny as this track might seem on paper, it's the kind of thing I can play for just about any human being and they'll at least smile, if not break into song themselves. That's how you kick off an album, with balls out riffing, blunt lyrics and a chorus to die for. If you want speed and power you've got \"Animals\" and \"The Oath\", but the album truly revels in its more 'epic' moments, the huge tracks like \"Mountains\" or balladry of \"Guyana (Cult of the Damned)\", perhaps the best metal song about Jim Jones ever?!\n\nManowar is truly the band to go mainline with all this sword and sorcery shit in metal music. Sure, bands were doing it in the 60s and 70s, but most modern fantasy power metal streams directly from this album (and its immediate family). They were singing generic tributes to the Vikings and Odin long before Amon Amarth picked up a pen and paper. Miraculously, Sign of the Hammer sounds as strong today as it did 25 years ago, with great atmosphere, powerful chugging rhythms and strong leads. If you're just looking to start their catalog, this year is a great bet, for having not one, but two killer records. I hate to sound like a 'born again' fan, but listening to this record in 2009 truly puts things in perspective. Death to false metal indeed.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThis is Manowar\u2019s somewhat oddball album, released in-between \u201cSign of the Hammer\u201d and \u201cKings of Metal,\u201d both considered classics among fans. However, there\u2019s a mystic aura surrounding this record. It smells like, money. Yes, money. A few tracks on this album seem to be made for a more rock friendly audience, however, this doesn\u2019t spell complete disaster. \n\n\u201cFighting the World\u201d is a catchy, simple kind of song, not typical of the Manowar lore. This is the part of the album that seems to be a little to friendly, \u201cBlow Your Speakers\u201d is a cheesy romp through the adventures of Manowar getting played on the mainstream radio. Pretty useless track honestly. \u201cCarry On\u201d is sort of a ballad, also a pretty questionable tune. These three songs aren\u2019t horrible, but you\u2019ll be thinking in the back of your head \u201cdo I really like these?\u201d Cheesy, badly written, a little too \u201cpoppy,\u201d and just plain old average. Nothing special honestly. However, you will find some gems here, case in point \u201cViolence and Bloodshed.\u201d A fantastic song really, aggression and speed are both present, unlike the first three songs. \u201cDefender\u201d is a slow, chugging, boring song that really doesn\u2019t get your blood pumping at all. Drums of Doom\u201d is completely useless, but a quick little instrumental that leads into \u201cHoly War,\u201d a pretty decent offering, not bad, not good, just right down the middle. Another useless track \u201cMaster of Revenge\u201d is also placed here. It offers nothing, it\u2019s just Eric Adams screaming with random effects. This album does end on a superb note. \u201cBlack Wind, Fire, and Steel\u201d is catchy as hell with aggression, which is something this album lacks. I must also note that Eric Adam\u2019s performance on this song is the brightest gem on this album.\n\n\u201cFighting the World\u201d has good production, a really bad cover art, and some really good songs (two to be exact). Overall, this album is pretty weak. Spotty writing, weak \u201cpoppy\u201d songs, too much negative to overcome the positives. Check out \u201cViolence and Bloodshed\u201c and \u201cBlack Wind, Fire, and Steel.\u201d The rest is either too boring or weak. The first three tracks are hard to judge, catchy, but crappy at the same time.\n",
        "\nAh yes, another home video release from the \"metal kings\" Manowar. This is a recording of their performance at the Earthshaker Fest in Germany. If you've ever watched or been at a Manowar concert, you understand what it's about. It has to be loud, bright, and loud. Did I mention it has to be loud up to Manowar standards? You get the point. This band likes it loud and if you're in the crowd, you've got no choice but to hear it that way.\n\nThe camera work is beyond fantastic here. Over 25 camera's exist, so you'll get many angles of the band performing, which is great. It's also in HD, if your picky on video quality, this also fills a void.Now, Manowar has decided to do something, that quite frankly, no other band has ever done before. Gathering former members to play on signature songs the performed on. Very interesting if you asked me. This band does things for there fans, they listen to them, and they deliver things that they want to see. The set list itself is typical Manowar. \n\nThey start of \"Manowar,\" a fan favorite and played well here. \"Son of Death\" is a guitar solo from Karl Logan, and a dam good one at that, entertaining the crowd while the rest prepare for \"Kings of Metal,\" which is one of the cheesiest songs ever, but the play it off well. \"Sign of the Hammer\" is one of the coolest tracks on this list, I've always considered it one of the bands best and I'm glad the play it here, it seems to be missing from modern set-list. Eric sings to the crowd and gets them fired up, he shows off why he's been the bands singer thoughout there existence. Next they play the \"Hail to England\" duo they normally perform, \"Blood of my Enemies\" and \"Kill with Power.\" Eric sings with all he's got on these songs and does a fantastic job. After these two tracks, Joey DeMayo introduces the \"Triumph of Steel\" line-up. Now Karl Logan and Scott Columbus take they're seats and let these two show what they've got. It's not everyday you see a band and they're former members actually get along, and play on stage together! That's a feat I suppose Manowar owns single handily. David Shankle is a very solid player with tons of energy (an understatement), and Rhino seems like he hasn't missed a beat whatsoever. \"Metal Warriors\" and \"The Glory of Achilles\" are the two tracks played with this line-up. Manowar almost plays nothing from there 30 minute epic, so it's cool to dust of that song and play something from it. The next little set are both songs from Battle Hymns, but before those tracks Joey preaches a bit then introduces Ross the Boss and Donny Hamzik, both the drummer and guitarist from that album. \"Metal Daze\" and \"Dark Avenger\" are played. \"Dark Avenger\" is kind of a blah track, it's not the best, but \"Metal Daze\" kicks ass, very catchy and rarely played. Actually both songs aren't played much, so it also cool to see them here. Once these blocks of songs are completed, the current line-up comes out and performs staples like \"Outlaw\" and \"House of Death.\" Two of the best Manowar tracks really.\n\n\"Herz Aus Stahl\" is performed for the German crowd, and is truly a cool thing to do. They also use the orchestra they hired to their full potential here and on the next few tracks. Then Joey begins to rant about Wagner, telling the Germans they own Heavy metal (which to be honest is true). Then, the rejection Manowar got from Wagner's grandson. Now, the orchestra that Joey hired performs \"Prelude to Act 3.\" This is a cool thing, but not really anything that enjoyable. It eventually molds into Manowar's newest track at the time \"King of Kings\" (which was in fact really one of the few good songs from that album \"Gods of War\"), the crowd eats it up and it should please you for sure. The last three songs with the current members are all played in style, \"Warriors of the World,\" \"Hail and Kill,\" and of course \"Black Wind, Fire, and Steel.\" This would normally end a Manowar concert. However, that isn't the case. Manowar has a surprise in store for the fans. Remember those short, quick little showings from former members, well, they all return to play the epic track, Battle Hymns.\" This is a feat beyond recognition really. All three guitarist and all three drummers playing the same notes at the same time without really missing a note or beat. Every guitarist gets his shot at a solo here, which is awesome considering all of them have an immense amount of talent. What a way to end an already legendary concert.\n\nYes, this is a fantastic show, but your also greeted with a ton of extras. How the entire concert was all set up, interviews, guitar and drum clinics, random competitions, even a stage show. Everything you could possibly imagine is here. This dvd is defiantly worth the money you pay for it. No band puts together such a great package. Amazing visuals, great performance, fantastic bonus material, get this if your a Manowar fan. If you are a Manowar skeptic like me, this will keep you quiet throughout. Pick it up, highly recommended.\n",
        "\nManowar is the definitely the band with the most loyal fans but also the most fanatic criticizers, due to their attitude and the image of the true heavy metal warriors they created for themselves. The truth lies somewhere in between. They have always remained faithful to the spirit of heavy metal but their continuous statements that they are the only true metal band etc. can only amuse you. There is no doubt that they have given us at least two of the best albums in the history of metal and I\u2019m referring to Hail to England and Sign of The Hammer. However, with their next two attempts they fell some steps behind. Now, The Triumph of Steel has come to silence all those who dared to defy them.\n\nBut has it really happened? Is Rhino fast enough on the drums to replace Columbus and can Shankle put himself in Ross the Boss\u2019 shoes on the guitar? Was it worth the risk to compose a 28-minute song based on the Trojan War? In my opinion, not enough. Let\u2019s take it from the beginning.\n\nAchilles, Agony and Ecstasy is truly an epic, but by no means does it justify its 28 minutes. Thematically it is separated in eight parts. A simple introduction prepares the path for Hector Storms the Wall to explode. The excellent guitar riff and the pounding drums make it definitely the best part of Achilles... Then we have The Death of Patroclus and an amazing performance by Eric Adams. Funeral March that follows is an inspired two-minute theme. But the drum solo that comes next is a big mistake. Okay, Rhino is a good drummer, fast, with great technique, still after a point it sounds endless and boring.\n\nHector\u2019s Final Hour is another fantastic performance by Adams as Hector lets out his feelings, knowing his death is at hand. That leads us to Death Hector\u2019s Reward. This one is really good, with fast guitar and smashing drums. All is well until that self-centered, ego-maniac DeMaio delivers a completely useless bass solo. He is good but why does he have to remind us every time in the worst possible way? The Glory of Achilles is the part that completes this too long epic. I believe that twenty minutes would have been a lot better.\n\nPersonally, I find bigger pleasure in listening songs like Ride the Dragon or The Power of Thy Sword. The first is very speedy with razor-sharp riffs and an awesome finale. The second might be considered at first as just a typical fast track but it isn\u2019t. The sword effects, its pompous refrain and the slow break at the middle make it simply magnificent. This is what I call Manowar!!\n\nUp till now things work fine for Manowar. Unfortunately the rest of the songs are not that good. Spirit Horse of The Cherokee that refers to the Indians mistreatment by the white man and Demon\u2019s Whip are good though they don\u2019t come up to my expectations. Burning does not sound like Manowar at all. Basically it sucks. Metal Warriors is a poser song unworthy of their glorious past and the ballad Master of the Wind is no match for the one and only Heart of Steel. And by the way, Shankle\u2019s solos throughout the whole album are uninspired and awful.\n\nSumming up I have to say that The Triumph of Steel is not bad. At least it is ten times better than the abomination called Fighting the World. It is not the masterpiece we hoped for but still it\u2019s quite good as long as you don\u2019t compare it with their best and truly epic things they did in the past.\n",
        "\nAfter reclaiming a great number of fans with the release of 1988\u2019s \"Kings of Metal,\" Manowar sought another new direction for their seventh effort. The music became even more epic and complex, the lyrics feature more variety than before, and guitarist Ross the Boss and drummer Scott Columbus were replaced by the technically superior David Shankle and Rhino, respectively. Unfortunately, this may be the only album to feature the new recruits...\n\nMusically, this album may be one of the band\u2019s most eclectic and diverse to date. Songs such as \"Ride the Dragon\" and \"The Power of Thy Sword\" are some of the fastest that Manowar has ever written while mid-tempo tunes like \"Spirit Horse of the Cherokee\" and \"The Demon\u2019s Whip\" stay interesting thanks to a menacing atmosphere and commanding performances courtesy of each member. Also worth mentioning is the album closer and sole ballad \"Master of the Wind.\" After hearing all the slower songs on the previous album, I find it amusing how this song manages to be powerful than the rest of them combined!\n\nOf course, I must give the band credit for composing the opener \"Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts.\" At over twenty-eight minutes long, this remains one of the band\u2019s biggest undertakings to date. It features many different tempo changes throughout that range from mid-tempo marches, fast paced raids, jazzy solos that showcase every member of the band, and even a theatrical melodic sequence that brings to mind \"March for Revenge (By the Soldiers of Death).\" Add in lyrics that closely follow the story of Homer\u2019s \"Iliad\" and you\u2019ve got a fairly interesting epic.\n\nSpeaking of lyrics, these may be some of the most interesting that the band has ever written. Don\u2019t worry, the lyrics are still about war and true metal, they\u2019re just about different wars and true metal. While Manowar\u2019s other albums typically immerse themselves within the worlds of Vikings and Valhalla, this album deals with topics such as the Trojan War (\"Achilles\"), Native American conquest (\"Spirit Horse of the Cherokee\"), and the occult (\"The Demon\u2019s Whip\"). Also worth noting are \"Master of the Wind\" and \"Metal Warriors\" with the former offering some particularly inspired lyrics and the latter featuring more of the metal elitist lines that we\u2019ve all come to love (\u201cIf you\u2019re not into metal/You are not my friend!\u201d).\n\nIt is fairly tough to identify the flaws that are present on this album. The biggest problem I found was with the album\u2019s track order. While the \"Achilles\" epic is a pretty strong track, its long length and extensive solo sections may prove to be a little too overwhelming for some and probably shouldn\u2019t have been considered for the opening position. A song like \"Ride the Dragon\" would\u2019ve been better in its place.\n\nAll in all, this may be my personal favorite Manowar album and one that I would recommend for listeners interested in the band.\n\nPros:\n1) Excellently diverse songwriting\n2) Powerful performances by each member\n\nCons:\n1) The track order could be better\n2) \"Achilles\" may make this album a little too overwhelming for some.\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Metal Warriors,\" \"Spirit Horse of the Cherokee,\" \"The Power of Thy Sword,\" \"The Demon\u2019s Whip,\" and \"Master of the Wind\"\n",
        "\nManowar's status as the laughing stock of metal/music is a pretty good example of just how metal is misunderstood by the masses, and indeed, by the fans themselves... So what if there's an album cover or two of them dressed in loincloths? Are those outfits really any stupider then those in Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Band? Besides, it's clearly somewhat tongue in cheek. Their lyrics also get some crap, but how are their lyrics any worse than, say, \"Here comes the Sun, do do do doo, here comes the sun and I say, It's alright\", or, say, \"Purple Haze\"? Or 99% of rock in general? Or, indeed, the more sophisticated, \"urbane\" genres like jazz or soul? Manowar are a good band that's got a bad rap for no real reason other than being unashamedly metal; and it's a real shame that they're mocked not just by the \"outside\", as it were, but by those within the metal community. Which brings us to this album; it's a really, really good bit of heavy metal that would be a common household album if Manowar got the tribute they deserve.\n\nNot being all that familiar with this sort of metal/hard rock it's hard to really spot the influences, a rough guess suggests that it's somewhere between Thin Lizzy, Maiden and Sabbath; certainly the doomy and epic \"Dark Avenger\" has a lot of love for the last two bands there. It's fast in places and there's plenty of speed metal on offer here but for every heavy, almost thrashing bit like the end of Dark Avenger, there's some straight forward, rocking sort of stuff like \"Shell Shock\" (which has some pretty rad lyrics) and \"Manowar\". Normally that sort of stuff would be a real low point for me but here it's catchy as all hell and bursting with energy and vigour; the major key riffing in \"Manowar\" being particularly catchy and infectious. \n\nThe final track of the album in particular is a great example of just untouchable these guys are when they're at their best. Sure, the mellow pre-solo bit is a bit unnecessary, but the intro sets the tone brilliantly, the main riff is transcendent 3/4 battle metal glory; chances are you've heard millions of riffs that sound really, really similar, but none can match the sheer valour and might of this one. And this all before the chorus comes along... damn, is it really possible to make a song as epic, as stirring, as this one? I think not.\n\nSomething of Battle Hymn's quality would be an obvious highlight of a typical metal album, here it's just a great way to end a really, really good album. These guys often throw in a few filler tracks here and there throughout their albums; here the only real moment where things go downhill is the (absolutely terrible) bass solo \"William's Tale\". Whether it's the energetic rock/metal of \"Fast Taker\" or \"Shell Shock\", the huge chorus and don't care vibe of \"Metal Daze\", or the few epics in this album, every song on this is a keeper. Eric's vocals are probably the thing that really makes the songs, particularly the shorter ones; the warts-and-all recording job does a really great job of representing his singing style; surprisingly versatile, very powerful; very passionate. He holds nothing back in his vocals; whether screaming or laying down some tuneful melodies. I'm sure some idiots would label it \"melodramatic\", I tend to call it \"being passionate about your music\", which surely isn't a bad thing? Indeed, the whole band is pretty passionate about the music; certainly the drummer's beating the crap out of his kit, while Joey and Ross lay down on the strings with typical Manowar passion and energy. \n\nManowar deserve celebration far more so then mockery, definitely. No big deal though; if music critics would rather listen to Motown then this then clearly they've got some sort of serious mental illness and there's nothing we can do. Needless to say you seriously need this album if you like good music.\n",
        "\nI applaud Manowar for their hard work in this new release of theirs, DIE WITH HONOR, and it's a pretty decent song, but I still get the feeling that they're losing their edge and their power. They always will have talent but they aren't up to par with the ass kicking, blow your head off stuff that they had back in the 80's. Let's examine the new single piece by piece:\n\nVocals: As usual Eric Adams shows that he can do a great job in delivering pretty much any vocal line that Mr. DeMaio writes for him. However it seems as though recently he's been consistently screaming less and sounding less and less brutal than normal. It's been maybe 15 years (?) or so since I've heard him pull off one of those mega high, brutal god like screams that seems to be getting, unfortunately, weaker as time goes on. Well I guess that's what aging will do to you. \n\nLyrics: Same old same old Manowar stuff. You gotta love it if you're a Manowar fan, but by the same token don't expect any thing new and original because we all know that Manowar regurgitates the same old lyrics over and over again. It will always be good, but sometimes I just crave for something new and exciting, and after a first time listen you get sorta upset to just hear lyrics that you heard in previous albums.\n\nDrums: This is unusually slow paced for Manowar. I know that they have a lot of slower paced songs (secret of steel, each dawn I die) but in those other ones it seemed to work; they had a doomy, spooky atmosphere to them but this song does not. It's almost getting towards the direction of sounding poppy, and pretty boring overall if you ask me. During Scott's (I presume it's Scott on the drums here) time to fill you don't hear much brutality or hard pounding like usual. This guy has been known to break regular drum sets with his strength...where is that power now? Please don't tell me it's gone. Has he been hitting the gym enough lately?\n\nRiffs/Songwriting: Well not bad depending on how you look at it. It's catchy enough and still can put that good fighting Manowar spirit inside of you when you sing along with it; it's a step up from Gods of War, it's more listenable, and you can learn to love it along with the rest of the Manowar legacy. There are different ways of delivering true, powerful metal. Just don't expect an old school 80's metal sound with this one. The epic chorus and the male singers towards the end still deliver enough to make you applaud the band for their attempt. \n\nSolos: I think Karl Logan is Manowar's best guitarist. Really I do. It took me a long time to decide this but I think that his style and techinque are better than Ross the Boss or David Shankle. He writes terrific solos and does so in such a professional way. The way he communicates through music is great!\n\nOverall, it's a good song. But let's just remember that this is MANOWAR and we have a long legacy and discography to compare and contrast this with. If you look at 80's Manowar, this fails. But seeing as though Manowar is my favorite metal band and greatest metal band in the world they have never sucked. A 71% is not a very nice rating but I did that for a reason because I know that they can do better. As a good rock song, it passes. As a Manowar song, it's still lacking in comparison to what they are capable of.\n",
        "\nManowar is a fantastic band, but with new material almost every year, it can be challenging for new fans to know what essential albums they need in order to join the conversation. Luckily, \"Anthology\" provides a comprehensive look at the band's first fifteen years.\n\nHeavy metal to the core, Manowar is known as one of the most metal bands of all time. Their playing style also includes several important genres (traditional metal, as is heard on the opening self-titled track), speed metal (Metal Daze), and the ever-important genre of songs about metal (All Men Play On 10, Blow Your Speakers, Metal Daze) without sounding like a Spinal Tap/AC/DC/Twisted Sister rip-off. \n\nMusically, the play a very solid metal with few distractions; maybe an acoustic interlude here or there, but other than that, nothing but nonstop savagery. Their lyrics are also a metal archetype; they deal with subjects ranging from metal itself to Norse mythology and even heroic battles.\n\nOn this album, the fourteen best songs from their first eight albums, with no filler or other bullshit. There is no such thing as a bad Manowar release, and this compilation removes all the excess and unnecessary songs, leaving nothing but their vital work. Who doesn't sweat through their shirt when they hear Blood Of The Kings? \n\nAll-in-all, if you can't afford Manowar's discography, Anthology will do the trick and let you in on one of metal's great bands.\n",
        "\nOne of the earliest power metal bands around, Manowar has it's fair share of both fan and detractor. Sometimes hailed as a band who refuses to compromise their brand of \"true metal\" and sometimes mocked for their overt seriousness towards ideals of being true and their often over the top lyrics. I'm a major fan of the band and view the lyrics and presentation as part of their charm. While I don't particularly about true-ness and slaying falses (though it is fun, don't get me wrong!), Manowar wouldn't be Manowar without the tales of metal conquering all or their often hilarious apparel.\n\nWhat we have here is Manowar defining themselves. Battle Hymns is an awesome album, but not really representative of what the band would come. The Manowar style was hinted at in the third to last and very last track on that LP, but here on Into Glory Ride we see them embrace the epic nature of those two songs. Aside from the silly, but fun Warlord, all of the songs are often mid or slow paced with with an emphasis on atmosphere. Topics range from Valhalla (an major influence on mid-era Bathory even though Quorthon downplays it), warfare, revenge for slain comrades and family and mystical artifacts and quests. I enjoy all of the tracks although as noted in earlier reviews, Hatred tends to drag during the instrumental section and I consider this the weakest song on the album. Out of the seven tracks, only one falls under 5 minutes with most exceeding that with the finale, the magnificent March for Revenge, being the longest.\n\nThe production is perhaps the biggest handicap. Though relatively clear, Eric Adams' vocals especially, there is a certain muddiness to the guitars. Sometimes overpowered by DeMaio's bass, this isn't too much of a problem as Joey often plays interesting basslines. The riffing is there, it's just a little hard to hear at times. Solos ring loud and clear, though. Ross the Boss may not turn in his best performance here, but the leads are good and enhance to the songs they appear in. Songwriting is strong and Scott Columbus, making his Manowar album debut, turns in a powerful performance crushing his drums with pounding rhythms.\n\nAs highly as I view this album, I would not recommend it to a person trying to get into Manowar for the first time. Kings of Metal or Fighting the World are much more easily accessible if not as strong in the songwriting department. Those looking for an epic adventure, however, would do well to purchase this album. Strong songwriting with excellent performances fill the album along with an intense atmosphere. I view this as being Manowar's finest hour with Hail to England only trailing due to it's unneeded bass solo. Pick this up and embrace the metal warrior in you!\n",
        "\nThe 90\u2019s were hard on a lot of 80\u2019s metal bands, but few were hit harder than Manowar. While most bands would make alterations to their sound in order to fit in with the growing wave of crap pouring in from Seatlle, Manowar admirably declared \u201cFuck that!\u201d and put out even more epic power metal in the form of the very true, yet interminably boring The Triumph of Steel. Not a band to abandon their hardheadedness in the wake of a shitty album, Manowar continued to write music in the same vein as pretty much everything they\u2019ve ever done, resulting in 1996\u2019s Louder Than Hell. And it really makes you wonder if, maybe just this once, a little change might have done the band some good.\n\nLouder Than Hell is just as brazenly metal as The Triumph of Steel, only here they\u2019re defying the growing nu-metal trend instead of grunge. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s almost as generic and boring as its predecessor. Opener \u201cReturn of the Warlord\u201d throws down just about every clich\u00e9 possible, from the \u201crevving\u201d guitar noises to perhaps the worst lyrics the band has ever penned, even going so far as to rehashing themselves. I swear this band hasn\u2019t written a new riff in the better part of a decade: riffs and words blend together into one tasteless stew of mediocrity. Despite Eric Adams\u2019 ever-powerful vocal attempt, this and most of the other songs on Louder Than Hell just plod along lifelessly. The only thing worth listening to is the guitar solos and you have to sit through several minutes of \u201csong\u201d just to get to them, some more difficult to survive than others (\u201cThe Gods Made Heavy Metal\u201d for instance, never seems to fucking die. They recycle the \u2018endless outro\u2019 concept that was fresh on \u201cBlood of the Kings,\u201d to less-than-thrilling effect). I can\u2019t understand why this band can\u2019t just write quick, simple songs like they used to instead of the limping snore-fests they\u2019ve been writing since the turn of the decade. Apparently the 80\u2019s Manowar had a natural songwriting chemistry that the 90\u2019s reincarnation (with mostly the same members) has been unable to recreate.\n\nNeed proof? Let\u2019s keep looking at the track-list.\n\n\u201cCourage\u201d is one brief stab at something different; different being a churchy sounding power ballad that couldn\u2019t hold a candle to \u201cHeart of Steel.\u201d \u201cNumber One\u201d has a nice groove to it, but the lyrics are dumber than hell (\u201cWe have come for the number one, not the number two\u201d\u2026\u2026.uh\u2026.they\u2019ve come to piss, but not to shit? Is this a GWAR cover?). \u201cOutlaw\u201d tries to pick up the pace but fails, having adhered to the standards of Manowar style-speed metal (i.e. one note tremolo picking until the listener dies of boredom). Then there\u2019s \u201cKing,\u201d which is actually a pretty solid song, but it\u2019s too little, too late. \u201cToday Is A Good Day to Die\u201d is the super-mega-epic-atmospheric instrumental masterpiece to end all masterpieces, which of course ends up being merely okay. This segues into \u201cMy Spirit Lives On,\u201d which begins like it would be a pretty fucking ripping power metal tune, but the drums never come in and you quickly realize it\u2019s just a guitar solo (it\u2019s technically solid, but I want to hear a fucking song already). Finally\u2026.that song comes in the form of \u201cThe Power,\u201d which is the only truly great Manowar track from their entire 90\u2019s career. This and \u201cKing\u201d are the only songs I wouldn\u2019t be ashamed to be caught listening to, something that I can\u2019t say about the rest of this tripe.\n\nManowar faithful will probably have an easier time digesting this one, so accustomed to mediocrity and disappointment are they. But yeah, this blows. Buy Into Glory Ride instead.\n",
        "\nManowar is back! This song says it. In the course of four minutes, the epic spirit of the band returns. The composition recalls the most glorious times of the group, and about it, I can write the following:\n\nThe song is a notable show of true/epic metal: good melodies, and an aggressive spirit for the battle. \u201cDie with Honor\u201d is the most appropriate name for a track with these features. The chorus is truly a magic moment: voices very inspired by the war, the legacy of Manowar, without doubt.\n\nThe song is not very original. But, it does not matter too much. The bass is simple but direct, the same happens with the voice. The theme also has an interesting guitar solo, and the drums is slowly played, which gives to the song a crushing atmosphere. This is Manowar: all the power in a single song, creating an incredible climate epic.\n\nI Think that Manowar, is a great band, possibly one of the best in the history of the genre. And I also believe that this track is no exception. If you are fan groups, should enjoy it as much as I do.\n",
        "\nWhen I heard that U.S. power metal stalwarts Manowar wrote a nearly-thirty minute epic based on the story of Greek legend Achilles, I was stoked. I am of the persuasion that when a band sets out to write a long single piece of music, they really get their shit together and make it an all-out masterpiece (see: Rush\u2019s \u201c2112 Suite\u201d or \u201cHemispheres\u201d). This assumption, combined with my love of prior Manowar releases, resulted in what might be the biggest musical disappointment I have ever experienced.\n\nThe album begins with said epic, entitled \u201cAchilles: Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts.\u201d Generally one would reserve the epic track for the closer, but putting it up front can work. The song begins well enough with a little dramatic sounding part before busting into the main riffage. Typical mid-paced Manowar with little keyboard touches, then it goes into a symphonic segue part which lasts until the eight minute mark. So far I\u2019m underwhelmed, but it would soon lead to disgust. I mean, there\u2019s a fucking four minute studio drum solo in here. Listening to this is incredibly tiring and the reward for surviving it is more symphonic bullshit. At the sixteen minute mark (over half of the song\u2019s total length), the first actual fast part rears its ugly head. Ugly because it\u2019s just another generic speed metal section, serving only to lead into *surprise* a Joey DeMaio bass solo! This piece is, like his other bass solos are, a technically self-indulgent shitfest, only different from the others in that he starts acoustic before kicking the distortion in. At this point I\u2019ve vowed never to listen to this song again for as long as I have the ability to hear, and the track isn\u2019t even over. After some three minutes of this, the guitars and drums kick back in and its back to the generic riffs before the guitar solo begins, as it\u2019s the only instrument left to not get its chance to show off. At this point, I considered vowing never to listen to Manowar again (this was soon repealed), the song is that fucking bad. And then, at its very end, as the guitar is furiously shredding away over the final riff, the song begins to fade out. After expending nearly thirty minutes of their time (and mine) telling the triumphant tale of Achilles, DeMaio and company couldn\u2019t even figure out a good way to end the fucking song. The fade-out is the laziest fucking way to end a piece of music, as evidenced by its frequent utilization in pop music. There are some exceptions of musicians using it artistically, but these are rare, and never apply to a lengthy track. It\u2019s actually quite ironic considering the lyrics: having killed their dignity with the first twenty-seven minutes of this horrific aberration, Manowar then chose to desecrate its body by robbing the listeners of an ending. All in all, it\u2019s the worst song I\u2019ve ever heard by this band and a massive, massive failure\n\nAfter that nearly endless sequence of pompous bullshit, I actually forgot that there\u2019s the rest of the album yet to listen to. Things pick up here, as its back to standard Manowar territory, but never at any point does the shadow of that first song cease to loom over the album\u2019s remainder. Sure \u201cMetal Warriors\u201d is pretty cool in that typical, cheesy Manowar fashion (\u201cIf you\u2019re not into metal, you are not my friend!\u201d), but man, did you hear that thirty minute travesty that opened the album? \u201cThe Demon\u2019s Whip\u201d resurrects the darker sound of past greats like \u201cBridge of Death,\u201d but how could you forget how fucking terrible that first song was? At no point during the rest of the album could I get over that fucking awful opener/centerpiece and it sucked out just about all the enjoyment I\u2019d usually get from a Manowar release. New guitarist David Shankle pulls some ridiculously fast guitar solos out of his ass (his mastery of EVH-style artificial harmonic runs is commendable), new drummer Rhino is an absolute machine when it comes to his instrument, Joey DeMaio delivers yet another great performance on bass, and Eric Adams still puts his heart and soul into the music while screaming out his lungs, but The Triumph of Steel is nonetheless tainted. Once you hear how inadequate the band is at writing a thirty minute song, you can\u2019t help but start to find flaws in their normal songwriting and what would otherwise be a decent (albeit generic) Manowar album degenerates into a full-fledged atrocity. Got riffs? Manowar apparently doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe band\u2019s newfound love for poorly-written symphonic sections is a bit confusing as well. The atmospheric numbers \u201cBurning\u201d and \u201cMaster of the Wind\u201d sound horribly incomplete, while random synth sections show up in \u201cThe Power of Thy Sword\u201d and long-ass intro sequences mar \u201cSpirit Horse of the Cherokee\u201d and \u201cThe Demon\u2019s Whip.\u201d Seriously guys, just play the songs already.\n\nNever let it be said that I do not respect Manowar for flying the flag of true metal at all times, even when it was least popular. But as The Triumph of Steel clearly proves (and it pains me to say this), true metal isn\u2019t always good metal. Manowar clearly over-extended themselves on this record; the mediocre second half of the album implodes under the weight of the bombastic opener.\n",
        "\nManowar have always been a band torn between two identities. On the one hand, clad in furs and wielding swords and axes, they have been one of the pioneering and most important epic metal groups ever. On the other hand, dressed in leather and riding motorbikes, they have been a rather narcissistic band that impersonated the ideals of rock n\u2019 roll. \n\nDuring the band\u2019s four first albums, the epic / heroic identity was apparently dominant. However, when \u201cFighting The World\u201d came out in 1987, it seemed that the rock n\u2019 roll / mucho identity had gotten the best of the group. \u201cFighting The World\u201d consisted mostly of light and commercial tracks, which lyrically focused mainly on Manowar\u2019 s physical and musical abilities, rather than the heroic feats of savage warriors. In general terms, the fans of the band disapproved of this new approach and that was reflected on their attitudes towards the album, which is considered to be Manowar\u2019 s weakest effort to date. \n\n\u201cFighting The World\u201d \u2019 s follow up, \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d, was released in 1988 and hailed by many as Manowar\u2019 s return to form. The epic element was obviously dominant again, and the group\u2019 s playing had become as tough and cruel as it used to be. Nevertheless, things were more complicated than they appeared. It might be true that \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d sounded more aggressive than \u201cFighting The World\u201d, yet the former should not be viewed as a significant improvement from the latter. Rather, it is more of a natural successor, the next step in a declining course within the band\u2019 s career. \n\nIn any case, let\u2019 s not jump into conclusions about the album\u2019 s quality: \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d is far better than \u201cFighting The World\u201d and indeed has many strong moments. \u201cThe Crown And The Ring\u201d is an excellent symphonic track, with a chorus that gives you shivers. Furthermore, it is very original, in a sense that it is something Manowar had never tried before. \u201cHail And Kill\u201d and \u201cBlood Of The Kings\u201d, despite their flaws, are good and enjoyable aggressive tracks that manage to raise the adrenaline level. Finally, \u201cHeart Of Steel\u201d is a touching and pleasant to hear ballad, even though it\u2019 s not close to what was generally expected from Manowar until then. \n\nHowever, \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d unfortunately sounds somehow disappointing at times. The main reason behind this could be attributed to the fact that the rock n\u2019 roll / mucho identity still dominates Manowar\u2019s music. As a result, the band manages to compose some aggressive and brutal tracks, yet the aggressiveness these tracks contain sounds somewhat hollow and fake, being the product of Manowar\u2019s desire to show off, rather than their eagerness to praise the noble deeds of legendary heroes. This drawback constitutes the central argument that explains why \u201cHail And Kill\u201d and \u201cWheels Of Fire\u201d could be considered rather good, yet not excellent songs. In a similar vein, as far as \u201cPleasure Slave\u201d and \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d are concerned, their childish and simplistic approaches, both musically and lyrically, easily render them two of the worst tracks the band had conceived until then. Finally, \u201cKingdom Come\u201d seems to be the trivial successor to \u201cCarry On\u201d, whereas \u201cBlood Of The Kings\u201d would be much more appreciated, had it not been for its totally pointless last part, where every member of the band seems to try to do anything possible to destroy his equipment. \n\nAnother quite disappointing aspect of \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d could be summarised in Eric Adams\u2019 performance. Up until \u201cSign Of The Hammer\u201d, Adams had been an extremely passionate and flawlessly theatrical performer, doubtlessly one of the most complete epic metal vocalists there ever existed. Nevertheless, from \u201cFighting The World\u201d and onwards, his vocals seem to get influenced by the general show - off tendencies of Manowar\u2019s music and he loses the noble feeling he had so successfully mastered until then. Thus, he ends up developing a seemingly cruel approach, employing an increased number of screams and a \u201cbad guy\u201d attitude that sounds totally hollow. However, in order to avoid generalisations, one should point out that \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d holds one of Adams\u2019 best performances with Manowar, and that performance is the symphonic \u201cThe Crown And The Ring\u201d, where Adams proves that he can still be an excellent singer when he wishes to. \n\nIn short, after the disappointment of \u201cFighting The World\u201d, \u201cKings Of Metal\u201d was considered to be a return to the old days for Manowar, yet it is questionable whether it deserves this characterisation. \u201cTriumph Of Steel\u201d, which followed, turned out to be a slight improvement, yet it was more than apparent that Manowar were gradually falling into decadence and, unfortunately, they seemed neither willing, nor capable of recovering.\n",
        "\nManowar\u2019s third album, \u201cHail to England,\u201d was apparently so named in honor of the country where they were most warmly received. Power metal was always more popular in Europe, so it doesn\u2019t really come as a surprise to me that the US ignored them (even though they were an American band), especially considering the poor quality of some of their material. Particularly, the poor quality of this album.\n\nI wish I could hear what everyone else is hearing, because this has got to be the tamest Manowar release around. The only thing that really rules is, as always, Eric Adams\u2019 vocals. From the moment you hear the opening shriek from \u201cBlood of my Enemies,\u201d you know this guy is going to give the same insane performance he always gives. The lyrics on this album are among the band\u2019s cheesiest, but who cares? The vocals rule. Similarly, Ross the Boss provides some mean guitar solos to awe and inspire and such. Otherwise, this is pretty weak. Songs are by-the-book Manowar mid-paced chuggers; bland riffs running amok and the super-loud bass guitar long outliving its welcome. Nowhere is this more obnoxious than in Joey DeMaio\u2019s mandatory bass solo \u201cBlack Arrows.\u201d Silly spoken intro leads into what is actually an initially impressive chunk of wankery that becomes entirely boring about a third of the way in (it\u2019s no \u201cEruption\u201d). Yeah Joey, we know you can play, quit filling up the albums with this bullshit. A piccolo bass is virtually a guitar. Give it a rest. But anyway, the production is also kinda weak, lacking the punch of their earlier albums, as well as that of some of their later ones. Plus the album is really short.\n\nA couple of rad songs do manage to squeeze through, however. Finale \u201cBridge of Death\u201d is the king of these, sporting a chilling intro and being perhaps Manowar\u2019s finest epic number. \u201cBlood of my Enemies\u201d is pretty effective as an opening track (and a down-tempo one at that), with great sing-along potential and a sweet solo. Eric Adams is particularly insane on this one: you\u2019d know it even if you were deaf. Everything else is pretty dependent on personal taste.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a soft effort from the so-proclaimed \u201cloudest band in the world\u201d and a poor tribute to a country that many of metal\u2019s most important acts call home. Skip it unless you\u2019re a fan.\n",
        "\nI've liked Manowar since I first got Into Glory Ride, and now after hearing several of their other albums, I consider myself a fan of the band. Well, I didn't have this one yet, so $6.99 seemed like an excellent price for anything with the name Manowar on it. I didn't question myself because I came to expect good material from Manowar, considering I hadn't gotten an album I didn't really like yet.\n\nWell, this album was dissapointing. Not that it is bad, it's just...well...not, Manowar good. First of all it's far too short. 34 minutes, with 2 of those minutes not actually music, just thunder, and horses hooves and that usual shit we expect from Manowar. Now, that stuff is all good and fun, but I expect some music too. So, we take out that stuff and we have about 32 minutes of music. Ok, 32 minutes of Manowar should be good none the less. It's not. \n\nThe album sounds like normal Manowar music (i'm assuming you already know what they sound like or have some good idea) but it's not as good. First of all, the epic sense is gone, going back to the simple kind of stuff on Battle Hymns. Now Battle Hymns is a great album, but this is not. The difference is the songwriting. Most of the songs on this album are just...mehhh. Not terrible but they make me want to shut off this album and pop in Triumph Of Steel or Into Glory Ride.\n\nSo let me rundown that 32 minutes of music. Blow Your Speakers is most definetely the worst Manowar song I've ever heard. It's still not terrible but it's not good. So let's that 4 minutes from the total time. 28 Minutes. That's the only terrible song, the rest range from mediocre to good. Yes, there are actually some very good songs on here. \n\nFighting The World is actually quite a catchy song and quite enjoyable. Yes it's a little less heavy than other Manowar songs but it still kicks ass none the less. Carry On is a weird ballad type song, but it's powerful, so it's like a ballad-like rocker or something. Anyway it's mainly weird because part of me hates it and the other part loves it. But I do love it more than I hate it so, it's a good song anyway. Violence and Bloodshed is an alright song but it begins with a minute of sirens and engine noises and that crap. We're down to 27 minutes of music. \n\nDefender is somewhat of an epic, but not nearly as good as Battle Hymn or any other Manowar epic. It's an okay song but just mediocre going by the Manowar standard. Holy War is a nice little metal tune, but not really enough to save the album. Lastly is Black Wind, Fire And Steel, by far the best song on the album. This aong actually pulls off the epic sense that Manowar is known for.\n\nSo, not a terrible album but nothing to rush out and buy. Consider purchasing for 0-5 dollars because the album is short and mediocre and not worth any more. Still there are some nice tracks on this disc, they are just clumped in with terrible ones that seem to leave a longer lasting impression on the listener.\n",
        "\nThis single was given out as a freebie at Magic Circle Festival 2008. It's not really any different from a bunch of other Manowar songs, but it's comforting to know that the band is still recording stuff. Who knows, we may not have to wait until 2012 for a new Manowar album after all.\n\nThe song itself is simple and offers no surprises. It's a bludgeoning, mid-tempo track of the sort that Joey DeMaio probably writes on the toilet. It starts out with a single-note bass riff, and then the vocals and drums come in, and the guitar enters part way through the first verse. The chorus is predictable but fun. There's also a backing choir as the song reaches its climax (the band sure loves their keyboards these days) and Karl Logan plays an excellent solo in the middle of the song. I will forever insist that Ross the Boss is THE Manowar guitarist, but Logan has got some serious chops.\n\nThe only really weak point with the song is Eric Adams' vocals, which sound very strained and tired. I thought his performance on Gods of War wasn't as flamboyant as usual, and here is even worse. He's no spring chicken anymore, and advancing age always hit vocalists the hardest.\n\nYeah, so basically if you've heard \"Call to Arms\", \"Die for Metal\" and blah blah, you've heard this. It's good, but extremely unnecessary. And since it's a \"bare bones\" single release, there aren't any live goodies or unreleased b-sides to entertain you. Okay, you can't expect musical genius from a free giveaway. I'm willing to make concessions. But despite this, it's hard to shake the feeling that the champions of true metal are getting just a bit too conservative.\n",
        "\nHail to England is often \"hailed\" (hur hur hur) as Manowar's greatest album. Which baffles me, because Sign of the Hammer is so much better in every way. What we have here is a collection of songs barely passing the 30 minute mark that doesn't even have enough riffs to fill the time. Sure, the riffs that are there are good, and I'll be damned if I don't sing along to the chorus to \"Hail to England\" or \"Blood of My Enemies\". But for every great riff, there's a bunch of mediocre riffs, aimless songs, and passages that, quite frankly, don't go anywhere. Take Army Of Immortals. That song could've easily been a 2 minute song, 3 tops. But it was padded enough to be four and a half minutes long, and in the bridge, it's nothing but a minute of Eric Adams shouting \"Metal makes us stronger makes us metal makes us stronger etc...\" which is good, I suppose, but it comes off as repetitive. Another example is the part in Bridge of Death right after the breakdown where Eric adams professes his love for satan. In that part, it's nothing but the verse riff repeated ad nauseum for around 2 minutes. And now that I've mentioned the breakdown, they could've easily cut that in half. Again, with all the repetition. There is no need for all the repetition in all these songs; one unfortunate carry over from Into Glory Ride is the extreme repetition, and the idea that the surefire way to be epic is to take a normal verse-chorus-verse song, and repeat the riffs over and over again until there's the necessary extra minutes. \n\nAlso, there's the matter of the production, as another fellow reviewer said. The snare and bass have been pushed to the top, and the cymbals cannot be heard. As well, it's as if the drums were recorded in a hermetic void; there's no space, the feel of the drums is very claustrophobic. The bass casts this muddy mess over everything, ensuring that nothing can be heard clearly in this mess. I've never liked DeMaio's bass, and it's only when he can tame the ridiculous sound and even out the mix that it gets tolerable. Because the bass is so mixed high, and with such a muddy, indescript tone, the guitars are utterly buried, which is a shame, because METAL IS ABOUT THE FUKKEN GUITARS FGSFDSFKL:Jk''ljk. The point I'm making is that the thing that usually defines a metal song (especially in a genre like Manowar's) is the guitar riffs. And on Hail to England, there are few, and they cannot be heard well. So as a result, it can never be great. So, even though there are some very interesting melodies, as Hail to England does have potential, it never reaches its potential. Pity.\n",
        "\nHail the Norse Gods, Manowar is back !\n\nThis new single, Die with Honor was presented for the first (fucking) time (in the world) at the 2008 Magic Circle Festival, were 20 000 copies were given away. \n\nThis song is a classical Gods of war-era Manowar song, very similar to Sons of Odin in some way. The song begins with the famous \"do-do-do do-do-do\u00e2\u20ac\u009d bass riff, already heard in Warriors of the world and Sons of Odin. It introduces a very grave, solemn verse, as if we were assisting a Viking death ceremony. \n\nThen the chorus kicks in, epic and powerful as always. The choir is well exploited and gives an even more impressive feel of epicness and might. The solo is pretty good and include an amazing shredding part (2:36 -> 2:44) where Karl Logan really shines. \n\nOverall, this song is all you can except from Manowar : Melody, Might, cheesy lyrics and epicness. It sounds like every other Manowar songs, but still manage to gasp our attention and make us pass a good, head banging moment. Oh and this song must be amazing live, thanks to the march-like chorus. \n\nHail and Kill !!!\n",
        "\nDespite being constantly regarded as a classic, I really can't understand why \u201cHail to England\u201d is so loved. It is a good album, but far from a masterpiece. There are some good songs to be found here and the record is pretty consistent, featuring some nice short songs, all of them catchy and heavy, a bass solo and a relatively long epic song.\n\nHowever, the big problem of the record is its production. The mix is incredibly bad, highlighting the bass, with the guitar being almost inaudible at times. There are tons of good guitar riffs, but, again, we can't hear them well in the majority of the times, which is obviously bad. Have I already mentioned that the bass is too high in the mix? Yes, I think so... Don't get me wrong, I love the bass guitar, I love bands that don't bury their bassists, but on this album, it doesn't work at all. I can imagine how better this album would be if the guitars were more audible. Jesus.\n\nAnyways, the vocals are outstanding as usual, Eric Adams is a brilliant singer, great great performance. He also shows some versatility, as he can sing melodically throughout the record but he can also sound very aggressive at times, with his amazing high-pitched screams and shrieks. The drumming is very simple and mechanical, Scott Columbus uses the \u201ckick-snare-kick-snare\u201d pattern too many times, which can annoy you. Great drum intro on \u201cKill with Power\u201d though.\n\nAs for the songwriting, all the shorter songs follow similar structures, but they are all quite competent and effective. They are all, as I've already mentioned, extremely catchy and powerful. The album begins with \u201cBlood Enemies\u201d which probably carries the best riff of the record. \n\u201cEach Dawn I Die\u201d is pretty similar, with a fantastic chorus sung by an inspired Adams. \u201cKill with Power\u201d is a personal favourite, great drum intro leading us to a crushing main riff. Again, Eric Adams is amazing on this song. The fourth tune is the title track, carrying another great chorus (have I already mentioned that Manowar knows how to write really addictive choruses?).\n\nThe second half of the record begins with \u201cArmy of the Immortals\u201d, another catchy little song but with a more elaborated structure.\n\u201cBlack Arrows\u201d is the track number six, the obligatory bass solo, which also contains a really tr00 metal spoken intro (\u201cLet each note I now play be a black arrow of death sent straight to the heart to all those who play false metal!!\u201d). Yeah, the Manowar spirit!\nFinally we reach the last tune, the epic \u201cBridge of Death\u201d, which contains pure black metal poetry: \u201cLucifer is King, praise Satan!\u201d, see where Gorgoroth and all those satanic metal bands got their inspiration? That's right, Manowar is that influential! Anyway, the first part of the song is pretty heavy, then there is a nice breakdown and another heavy segment closes the song. This is no \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d or \u201cThe Power of Thy Sword\u201d, but still a decent and competent closer. Probably, for the afore-mentioned reasons, Satan's favourite Manowar song, so that's something.\n\nSo, all in all, a decent album, catchy and straight-forward. It also is pretty short and the whole listening experience is better because of that. Also, the album sounds better as a whole than individually. This piece would sound amazingly well with a better production and mix (and, must I add, with better drumming too?), \u201cHail to England\u201d had potential indeed, but, meh, in the end it is just a competent catchy record. \nIf you need an introduction to this band try this, since this album is also pretty acessible. \n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the beginning of \u201cKill with Power\u201d.\n",
        "\nAs, most of us, know this album contains a song that is 29 minutes long. \"Achilles, Agony, and Ecstasy In Eight Parts\" does dominate the album. The song is, as the title states, in eight parts, and it chronicles the battle between Hector and Achilles. The song itself, is very jazz inspired. That doesn't mean it has a horn section, but the structure of the song is similar, with each member having their own extended solo. The drum solo in particular is very good, displaying an arc, where it builds and builds to fierceness. \n\nSo, what about the rest of the album? You may be surprised to hear that there are 8 songs on the album. \"Achilles...\", and seven others, and two of them are almost eight minutes long. This is a long disc, yet it is entertaining throughout, a flaw we find in many similar lengthed albums. \n\nWe, have Manowar as we all know them on this album, with massive riffs, signature vocals, and...everything else. The album is structured very well. However, there is one thing that annoys me. Almost every song begins with a narration. \"Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee\" doesn't start until a minute and a half into the song. We have to endure a minute and a half of two people talking at once, making it even worse than a normal narration because we can't even hear what they're saying, before we get to the actual song. The song itself is very good though with some plodding riffs and drum beats and the chorus is one of the best on the album.\n\nThe narrations really fill the album with a lot of crap, since almost every song has a minute of it. None the less, this is a great little disc and I'd like to begin on an high note by praising Manowar's sense of humor. In the Cd booklet they write, \"Suffer and die slowly listening to our music.\" You know when a band writes something along the lines that they suck, they're good. Look at Primus, whose slogan for the longest time was \"Primus sucks.\", accompanied by fans chanting it at concerts. The sense of humor just makes me relate with Manowar better.\n\nTo conclude, this is a great album, with no weak tracks, and consistent throughout it's long run time. Manowar fans should embrace this album, even if they did not like it before, for it is a great display of Manowar just being an amazing band. I conclude.\n",
        "\nAfter the epic and quite long album \"Into Glory Ride\", Manowar did something very interesting. They decided to stick to the epicness established on the previous effort, but cut down on the song lengths which was a very effective decision since it made their music a bit more accessible to general metal fans. This is a very short album, clocking in at just under 34 minutes, very similar to the Slayer behemoth \"Reign in Blood\". The exception being that this album is a lot better IMO. This was also Manowar's first stab at being more of a power metal oriented band, as this is very much a proto-power/thrash metal album.\n\nThe production is very dense and metallic. Scott Columbus' drums have a very black metal-esque rattling sound, Joey DeMaio's bass is at the front of everything and Ross' guitar stays a bit more in the background, which is very unusual to say the least.\n\nThe album opens with \"Blood of My Enemies\" which is an instant Manowar/viking metal classic. It begins with a chilling bass intro by Joey, before the song turns into a slow thrasher with a pounding rhythm unlike anything I've ever heard before. Also worthy of notice is the background choir during the chorus.\n\n\"Each Dawn I Die\" is a bit more rocky in its approach. It's a very bass heavy song that features some very distinctive bass notes courtesy of Joey. Eric Adams' vocal performance is once again top notch as always. I might as well also explain what the lyrics are about. They are about an ancient Indo European/ancient Greek myth in which men would be able to travel to the Isles of the Blessed if they reached some common ground with the gods. And the gods didn\u2019t like people at all.\n\n\"Kill with Power\" is pure thrash metal, and it has a pretty basic but effective thrash rhythm and main riff. Of special notice is Eric's evil as fuck vocals and his evil laughs. Although he would later perfect his vocal performance on this song.\n\nThe title track is perhaps one of the more epic tracks on this album, and it was this track that transformed me into a hardcore Manowar fanatic. Everything about this song is absolutely perfect. The mighty chorus with the church choir backing up Eric's vocals, the guitar solo, the verses, everything.\n\nNow, the next two songs are the reason why I can't give this album a 100% rating. \"Army of the Immortals\" is a pretty epic NWOBHM-esque number with a catchy main riff, but it doesn't get anywhere and ends up becoming a lot more repetitive than the other songs. And I don't think I have to mention \"Black Arrows\", which is just pure noise.\n\nAnd then we come to an end with the Satanite epic entitled \"Bridge of Death\". It begins once again with a bass doodle by DeMaio. It then turns into a dark and pounding doom/proto-black metal number and shows why Manowar were and still are superior IMO to Mercyful Fate and Venom. Also notice the spoken part where DeMaio sounds like a fucking demon!\n\nBuy this album if you like power metal and/or thrash metal. Or perhaps if you want metal of the highest order.\n",
        "\nMany argue that this is one of Manowar\u2019s weaker offerings due to an overly commercial approach to their, at this time, solidified formula. However, the truth is that there isn\u2019t much on here that is more commercial than what can be heard on \u201cBattle Hymns\u201d or the follow-up \u201cKings of Metal\u201d. It\u2019s the same original blend of epic, rock, and cheese that has always made the band one of my preferred metal flavors. My only real gripe about the album is that it\u2019s too damn short.\n\nThere is a strong sense of catchy arena oriented rock mixed into the first three songs which give an impression of a mainstream 80s effort. They all feature simplistic melodies and straightforward musical ideas, particularly the use of backup singer chants that give an atmosphere of a giant stadium singing along with Eric Adams as he belts out some of the most obnoxiously high notes heard out of a singer with his testosterone level. Even the acoustic intro of \u201cCarry On\u201d has a largeness to it that typifies the spirit of Manowar\u2019s sound.\n\nIf you judged this album by only the first 3 songs then the assertion that it is a collection of radio singles might hold up, but after wards things go back to the usual mix of true metal ingredients. \u201cViolence and Bloodshed\u201d was likely what earned this album its Parental Advisory label, steeped with aggressive lyrics and good old fashioned Manowar style chunky speed metal. \u201cDefender\u201d is the album\u2019s epic number, complete with a guest narration slot by stage and screen veteran Orson Welles and all of the usual grandiose themes that made the \u201cBattle Hymns\u201d album title track a standard in the metal world.\n\nThe second half of this album\u2019s format is quite deceptive, as it lists and is organized into 4 songs (2 short, 2 full length), but essentially listens as 2 epic speed metal tracks with elongated intros. In the case of \u201cBlack Wind, Fire and Steel\u201d, which is rightly hailed by many as the greatest song on here, the theme of \u201cMaster of Revenge\u201d actually recurs at the end after a veritable mountain of free timed guitar noise and feedback. Although Manowar has had many moments of sheer genius in their lengthy career, the final 2 tracks on here actually outdo the finer moments on what would otherwise be superior albums. It has the flash and flair of \u201cBlood of the Kings\u201d and the riff driven aggression of \u201cWheels of Fire\u201d.\n\nThe general truth about Manowar is that with one or two small exceptions, when you purchase one of their albums you get a quality product with all the barbaric fury of a thousand berserkers fresh off the dragon boats. Their physical bodies may have been conceived in New York, but their souls sprang from the very gates of Valhalla. \u201cFighting the World\u201d is a highly recommended addition to the collection of any 80s metal fan, especially a Manowar fan who prefers the era when Ross the Boss was tearing up the fret board, although this is probably one of their lower rated albums due to a strong collection of radio friendly rockers. But for all of you radio haters out there, remember, every Viking has to leap from his boat and stand on the same ground as everyone else in order to achieve conquest.\n",
        "\nFor twenty-seven years Manowar has unapologetically sent the balls of the whorish mainstream through their eye sockets with the iron boot that is heavy metal. Not one to shrink from the task of diversifying the barbaric slaughter that is their sound with some epic interludes, what you often get is a middle ground between a very melodic and cheesy speed metal and a quasi-symphonic film score with keyboards and narrations blazing away. In spite of being seasoned veterans of their craft and sometimes derided as old timers, they have not relented, as can be heard on this triumphant single.\n\nAlthough a bit longwinded for a single, I can see the point of a prelude of this magnitude to kick off a full length album that is quite ambitious musically. The featured track that follows the prelude \u201cKing of Kings\u201d is classic 80s speed vintage with no apologies to a musically dead mainstream outside of metal\u2019s bounds. Although keyboard heavy throughout, the thunderous rhythm section and pounding guitar give this track an equal dose of adrenaline that is comparable to the blazing fury of such classics as \u201cBlack Wind, Fire and Steel\u201d and \u201cBlood of the Kings\u201d. \n\nThings do slow down a bit for a keyboard driven and narrated interlude, but for those who understand Manowar\u2019s history, this is something that has always been present in their music. I hope that the critics who obsess over the interludes here were consistent with older Manowar classics such as \u201cDefender\u201d which sported similar narratives. But afterwards we get an amazing methodical solo display on the part of Karl Logan, who bests a good deal of Ross the Boss\u2019 work with the band. \n\nThis is a song that will no doubt satisfy the prolonged desire of the Manowar faithful who have seen a slowing in the band\u2019s output since \u201cThe Triumph of Steel\u201d. It is a pretty good indicator of the musically ambitious nature of the full length release \u201cGods of War\u201d, which is heavily criticized for being too book-on-tape oriented. If you happen across this single in a bargain bin somewhere and you don\u2019t have the full length, it would be worth picking up, but real fans of Manowar get the whole experience on the LP with the volume maxed out.\n",
        "\nI recently came across Manowar and realized that they were something I was into. I had always confused them with Mastadon, a band belonging to a genre I am not too big on, but anyway, I got this album. If you're looking for fast, screaming, raging, thrash, this is not what you're looking for. However, I like Manowar, instead of being like that they choose to have their songs sound like a fusion of Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden. I like it and find it an interesting mix. \n\nSo, to get on with the actual songs. Most of the songs I really like, but there are some I don't like a lot. These would be 'Warlord' and 'Hatred', 'Warlord' starts out with some...interesting...sound effects and the song doesn't sound like the rest of the album, it's more happy, rocker like. Then there's 'Hatred', that just sounds kind of awkward.\n\nAnd I really like all the other songs. Especially 'Gates Of Vahalla' and 'Revelation (Death's Angel)'. There's some really nice riffs thrown throughout, a lot of eccentric drumming, and consistent vocals. But as I said before if you want some speeding fast guitar work and screeches of anger, then this isn't for you. These are the kinds of musicians I admire because they don't play fast and angry to pretend their good, what they do do is show they have raw energy and actual talent. The songs range from mid-tempo epics, to slow moving, building epics, with a couple shorter rockers too. \n\nAlthough. I only own this Manowar album, I still will look into more of their stuff because this is a solid album. If you admire raw energy and plodding riffs more than blaring screaming fast riffing guitars then you will probably like this, a lot. Otherwise you may want to pick up some Metal Church, which is a similar band that was around about the same time, yet play the same kind of stuff a lot faster. Manowar-Into Glory Ride is a strong release for metalhead's who admire really good music.\n",
        "\nManowar seem to be a bit curious these days. When I first got into them, and for years afterwards, they were one of the bands that defined traditional Heavy Metal and how it should be played. From the straightforward debut Battle Hymns, through the more laid-back and accessible Fighting The World, to the bombastic The Triumph Of Steel, this was Heavy Metal that was powerful, memorable, and rarely failed to the the adrenaline flowing and heads banging.\nThese days, though...well, I don't know what's going on, really. This is only their third studio album in 15 years since the aforementioned Triumph Of Steel, and in the abscence of extensive touring to keep us happy, you'd expect these albums to be bloody exciting affairs. Unfortunately their last album, Warriors Of The World, has been gathering dust in my collection for years, owing to it being an EP's worth of Metal songs (and not their best at that) accompanied by rather dull orchestra pieces. Finding out that this album would be similarly orchestral sent alarm bells ringing, but, Hell, I thought...it can't be worse than the last one, and if it's done well it should be something epic. That's what Manowar do best, right?\n\nLet's not fuck around here. This is an orchestral epic, both musically and in the amount of space on the album the strings take up. Given that this is a conceptual piece about Odin with some artistic liberties being taken - more a comic book story than an accurate representation of Pagan gods - you HAVE to take in this album as a whole and appreciate it as such. Dipping in from song to song will probably only disappoint. Though there's a good 40 minutes worth of Metal material here - remember when albums came on vinyl and lasted that long? - it's somewhat overwhelmed by the material around it. However, unlike last time, the Metal is interwoven into the orchestral pieces, and they work together to drive the album and story forward. The good old Mano-choir is ever-present to ensure continuity between the two styles, along with various spoken word passages and orchestral interludes scattered over the album. That bassist Joey DeMaio has produced and engineered the album and written almost all of the material is indicative of how this album is supposed to work as a whole. If you've got 73 minutes spare to sit through it, then fine. You'll need that to get the most out of it.\nThe orchestral parts themselves are listenable enough. Obviously they'll probably be more rewarding for fans of classical music...or maybe those people will find all kinds of faults to pick with it. I dunno. Those needing headbanging goodness all the way have probably figured out to steer clear by now, so never mind them. Those of us in the middle, though, will probably be able to enjoy these parts for their epic nature. They might even be more enjoyable than the actually Metal songs...\nThis is where things get awkward. These songs are good enough in themselves, and pleasing to the ear. However, they are pleasing to the ear because there's nothing pushing the boat out that could throw you off and ruin them. Unfortunately, because there's no boat being pushed out, there's nothing particularly great out them. No classic riffs or solos like before, nothing approaching technical playing (except about two guitar solos, maybe?). Eric Adams steals the show here, his voice still as pure and powerful as it was in 1982, even if the screaming of old is largely gone. Otherwise, it's standard riffs and rhythms. Good enough, but nothing to go crazy over. Thank god the band finally got a good producer though (cheers Joey!). I don't think the band has ever sounded so crisp, and this would have been essential for the album's musical concept to work. Helps make up for the lack of imagination in the songs too.\n\nFor all the faults mentioned here, though, I cannot emphasise enough how this has to be taken as a conceptual entireity. The whole is arguably greater than the sum of it's parts. Listened to from beginning to end, if the orchestra and epic theme can be appreciated, then it works. I tip my hat to Manowar to trying something different (though this is hardly different to fans of Rhapsody and their ilk, but they'll lap this one up anyway), but I do hope that when it comes to putting out a kick-ass, nothing but HEAVY METAL album, they'll be upping the ante again by playing their guitars, pounding the drums and screaming down the roof like before. If they keep to schedule, hopefully they can do something for 2012 that moves the world the same way that Battle Hymns did in 1982. In the meantime, this will do...\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalmongrel.com\n",
        "\nIt's not a bad CD. Really, it's not. It's just a sea of musical mediocrity, with cheesy lyrics. Not that we expect lofty things from Manowar... cheesy lyrics is their schtick, after all. \"If you do not like metal, you are not my friend\". \n\nThe vocals are sometimes mid-ranged, sometimes falsetto singing and screaming, and are very good. They actually work well with the cheesy lyrics--I can't imagine a guy with a death metal grunt singing this stuff. By this point in their career, the vocalist has a pretty good ear for when to stay low key, and when to turn the amp up to 11.\n\nAs far as guitars go, there isn't much that's memorable here. The guitar work isn't bad--there even some nice riffs and melodies--it's just not very memorable stuff. The production is fairly good, and the instruments do sound good, there just isn't enough instrumentation going on for the listener to hear. There's a lot of sustaining chords, dead air, etc.\n\nThe bass is good, as one might expect from this band. The drums, on the other hand, are a sore spot for me. I'm thinking especially of the drum solo. It's hard to make a drum solo interesting, but it's even worse to put it in a song that is already way too long at 28 minutes! What were they thinking? I guess if you're gonna bury a drum solo somewhere, though, that'd be the place to do it.\n\nAgain, this isn't a bad album, it just has a definite \"been there, done that\" vibe to it. There's nothing new here, it's just music playing, to be forgotten as soon as you stop the CD. If you're interested in the band, you'd be better off getting one of their older albums.\n",
        "\nI wanted to love this album. I honestly did. I love Manowar, and I love the epic sound they've pioneered. I love everything this album stands for -- steel, hate, war, honor, glory, pride, etc... I even love the absolutely cheesy album cover. I love the logo, I love the lyrics, I love all that shit. But I can't bring myself to love this album. I loved Hail to England and almost every album after that with a few hiccups on the way. \n\nBut I do not like this album. It's mediocre in the worst way. It's not horrible by any stretch of the imagination, it's just relentlessly boring. The epic songs are long and rambling, and are full of repetition and some really boring riffs that have no place on a Manowar CD. This, like its stillborn predecessor, is what Manowar were like before they really found their sound. \n\nIt is apparent that Manowar wanted this CD to be epic. The problem is songs like Gloves of Metal and Warlord, which are out of place on this CD. Gloves of Metal is slow indeed, but slow=/=epic. Manowar haven't learned that yet. Warlord is a mid-fast paced rocker with stupid lyrics (though that's part of Manowar's charm) and a really stupid riff that manages to be completely unmemorable. Basically, it's a song that I always skip whenever they perform live. \n\nThe production doesn't help either. Even Joey DeMaio's supposed \"flawless\" production on the silver version is muted and lame, in the literal sense of the word, as in impotent. It completely neuters the CD, and robs it of any testosterone-laden charm it might've had. The guitars manage to be completely overpowered by the drums, and the bass is present only as an incoherent rumbling. \n\nHowever, the core issue I have with this CD is that it is completely unmemorable. No amount of shit production can obscure the quality of the songwriting, and it shines through here that Manowar didn't know how to write memorable epics. Songs like Gates of Valhalla, March for Revenge and Revelation (death's Angel) clearly have some interesting riffs (usually at the beginning), but instead of progressing from those riffs into something grander and greater, they repeat the riff ad nauseum until you're sick of it. Seriously, Gates of Valhalla is 2 or 3 riffs. WTF, Manowar? I listen to you guys for riffs. Endless riffs. The orchestra of Kings of Metal and their latest two albums is fun, and complements their music greatly, but in the end it's the guitars that make Manowar. The guitars and the singing. It would be a lie to say that the riffs are boring, because a lot of them aren't. A lot of them are quite interesting. It's just that there is a disturbing LACK of riffs here. It's the repetition that bores me, the way they drive the good riffs and the bad riffs into the cold, cold, ground. \n\nHowever, there must be a special mention for the song Hatred. I dunno what it is, but I see no value in that song. It seems the four cylinders of Manowar misfired on that song, because it goes from boring riff to boring riff to boring riff. Manowar are trying to be \"evil\" with that song, and it's an embarrassingly pathetic failure. One aspect that Manowar carried from their first album is that their slow songs sound like unmemorable Black Sabbath ripoffs, and to some extent on this album, that is the case. It is especially the case with Hatred. It is not hard to believe Joey DeMaio was a roadie for Black Sabbath, because this song sounds like a really boring \"homage\" to Black Sabbath. \n\nI am filled with immense frustration when I listen to this album, because MANOWAR, YOU ARE NOT EVIL, YOU ARE NOT BLACK SABBATH, YOU ARE NOT \"EDGY\", AND FIRST AND FOREMOST, YOU ARE NOT \"HEROES\" WHO DIE FOR METAL. YOU ARE A HEAVY METAL BAND. THAT'S ALL. \n\nHowever, I don't hate the CD. It's not a bad album, despite what my comments may lead you to believe. However, it suffers from the same disease that its predecessor, Battle Hymns, suffered from, which is horrid production and boring songs. I would get it if you are a Manowar fan and want to complete your collection, but if you're new to Manowar, I'd get Kings of Metal first, that CD defines Manowar and is their best.\n",
        "\nManowar was among the latest of discoveries for me as a person who missed most of the 80s. Ironically I started getting into them at around the time that this, their most blatantly patriotic of albums in \u201cWarriors of the World\u201d, was released. Naturally patriotism was a bit en vogue in the aftermath of 9/11 here in the states, and while some releases sacrificed quality for nationalism, all were unified in their effort to capture the spirit of what America is about. This release embodies the most balanced of America\u2019s traditions of steadfastness and integrity without the overt pompousness of Iced Earth\u2019s \u201cThe Glorious Burden\u201d or Dio\u2019s pugnacious relationship with the politics surrounding this time period.\n\nAt first listen this release seems to give the impression of a band that is maturing into a more mellow formula, such as was the case with Metallica at the turn of the 90s. There is a good deal of ballad work, much of it musically eclectic, yet still maintaining the essence of Manowar\u2019s kick ass approach to things. \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d is the most unexpected of this lot, showcasing Eric Adams doing a rather exceptional performance of a Puccini aria with some rough edges at the end. \u201cSwords in the Wind\u201d and \u201cThe Fight for Freedom\u201d are a bit closer to typical Manowar style ballads, the former reaching towards the \u201ctrue metal\u201d approach of older models such as \u201cDefender\u201d and \u201cMaster of the Wind\u201d, while the latter mostly resembles the grand piano approach off of the \u201cLouder than Hell\u201d release. \n\n\u201cThe March\u201d is an instrumental/orchestral homage to Richard Wagner. Not particularly my favorite composer from the Romantic era, mostly due to his meandering sense of harmony, and Manowar\u2019s take on his style is actually not far off from the original in this respect and thus skip worthy. \u201cAn American Trilogy\u201d is another mostly vocally driven number and quite a unique rendition of 3 classic patriotic songs. Probably not the most metal thing ever to come out of the band, so it might not play well with people looking for aggression and bloodshed.\n\nThe metal on here comes in two basic varieties, one being the beat you to a pulp slowly metal, the other the grind you to oblivion with speed and riffs form. The title track is probably the catchiest song on here; it has that famous bass drone first popularized by Black Sabbath in 1980 on \u201cHeaven and Hell\u2019 as well as some and plenty of the vocal devices to put it in a similar league. \u201cCall to Arms\u201d takes the prize for the heaviest sledge hammer of a metal song. The last 3 songs are all speed metal and tend to run together a bit. In fact, the only really major flaw on here is that they completely back-loaded all the speed metal, which makes for an irregular pacing that was part of why I had a hard time fully appreciating this album at the time. \u201cHouse of Death\u201d is the best out of the 3; it almost rivals the speed classic \u201cBlack Wind, Fire and Steel\u201d.\n\nWhile I still thoroughly love most of what is on here, most Manowar fans will likely have problems with a lot of the extra non-metal stuff that\u2019s been thrown on here. Back in 2002 I\u2019m certain that even the most core-Leftist of metal heads here in the states was blasting out patriotic music due to the cultural climate of the time, but nowadays we\u2019ve been inundated with it for so long that it\u2019s lost a good deal of it\u2019s meaning. If you\u2019re new to this band, I\u2019d recommend picking up \u201cKings of Metal\u201d first, but this one would be worth your money if you have it to spend.\n",
        "\nI've managed to miss most of what Manowar has been doing in the last few years so when I heard this album was coming out and that it would be a true concept album about the Norse mythology, I got pretty excited. Aside from such great bands like Tyr, Amon Amarth, Manilla Road, etc I couldn't think of a better band to do such an album especially given Manowars track record with such topics in such classics as Into Glory Ride, Hail to England or their epicness in in Kings of Metal, Triumph of Steel, etc. Thus, armed with these such expectations I warded into this album.\nIf one has read anything in the reviews the sense that their is a lack of power to be found in these songs is absolutely what I found to be the case. Where was Adam's treble shattering falsetto when many, many moments on this album called for him to let loose like in Hail to England? Where where the killer riffs that should have kicked in repeatedly throughout this album but always managed to dissipate into blandness halfway through? And most of all, where was the accompanying awesome solos Manowar is so fraught with in their older works? I didn't even start to expect the drums to be amazing as half-way through it became abundantly clear that Columbus probably didn't break out the steel plated drums for this one.\nCompared to any of their great works, Glory, England, Kings, or Triumph, this album is missing pretty much everything about those that made them great. The drumming of Glory, the vocals/solos/riffs of England, the orchestral epicness or Kings or Triumph....all not to be found.\nInstead, what I got and actually happened to like, was a huge swaggering sense of bombastic, not epic, glory in the form of many, many awesome spoken word tomes and orchestral selections. Then when the album truly kicked off, in every case, major failure to deliver except in some cases such as \"King of Kings'' or \"Blood of Odin\".\nThis was a huge shame in my view as most bands as old as Manowar are really putting out some of their best work in recent days, i.e. - Manilla Road, Dio, etc and while what I got was not as huge a change in style as to kill the enjoyment of the album (such as the latest couple albums from Running Wild for example) the musical intensity was very much absent. This absence didn't make me hate the album enough to toss it completely, as the lyrics, spoken word, and orchestral selections are just great by themselves or in mixes, but I can't say that anyone who is not as fond of such things to check this album out if they aren't just a complete fanboy. I mentioned Manilla Road earlier and I absolutely see that kind of spirit absent in \"Gods of War\" in their playing nowadays and highly recommend their last album, \"Gates of Fire\" to this album as in that they follow the true Manowar code: that real men play on 10.\n",
        "\n'Gods of War' is, without a doubt, the most nuanced and artistic work of Manowar's career; and on that note alone I wish I could just give it 100% and be done with it, so much do I want to cheer Joey DeMaio's sheer audacity. However, there are definite flaws here; avoidable flaws, and ones that drag down the work to merely 'very good'. But it could have been so much more, and perhaps - next time - it will be.\n\nFirst, then, the good. Manowar could have made all of their fans happy just by releasing a million slightly different versions of 'Kill with Power' for the rest of their career; but commendably, they refuse to do so. This album is instead a collection of highly symphonic, trad-metal influenced pieces (in melodic, thematic and harmonic construction rather than timbre), spoken word storytelling and a couple of thundering Manowar classics thrown in for good measure. The orchestral effects by far outweigh the guitars on this album, which will be a problem for more unadventurous metal fans; however, by breaking free from the ever-more restrictive environment of the genre, Manowar have transcended it, giving this work a much greater dramatic and musical range than their more standard fare.\n\nManowar's presentation of the Norse myths is, at times, utterly perfect; 'The Blood of Odin' (a spoken word passage augmented by sombre orchestral flourishes) in particular is almost ludicrously powerful. Indeed, the myths and legends fit so well here that they seem almost inseperable from the band's music; heroism, comradeship, and the absolute reverance to power and the ideal of the warrior are expressed in a fashion that I suspect the Vikings themselves would have heartily approved of. The greatest achievement of this album is that it feels deeply authentic, something that very few other Viking-themed works have ever managed. Mightily overblown it may well be, but overblown is the only way to go with emotional themes this grandiose, this epic. There is no nihilism, no cynicism; the music expresses a rich tapestry where life is cherished, glory is sought, and the valorous need not fear death. \n\nIn addition, some of the melodies played on 'Gods of War' are, without doubt, amongst the best Manowar have ever penned, or even some of the most blood-stirring recorded in the pantheon of metal; see the chorus to 'Sleipnir', 'The Sons of Odin' and the beautiful a capella chorale, 'Army of the Dead' - a title that sounds cheesy, and yet when the lyrics are examined turns out to be surprisingly poetic given Manowar's past history. (I mean... 'Kill with Power'? Come on!) For those who find themes of heroism and glory deeply satisfying, here are the tunes to absolutely express those feelings.\n\nBut, nevertheless, there are problems. Repetition plagues this release; from lyrical snippets to musical motifs that eventually get stale. Manowar have broken up longer pieces into separate chunks and spread them across the album; this works well, as the pieces combined would have got unbearably repetitious. Even so, some of the pieces tend to flag. Nor are only musical motifs overused; the phrase 'swords in the wind' is abused to an absolutely ludicrious extent, as though DeMaio basically ran out of things to say and just filled the remaining few lines with generic warrior cliches instead. There are also the occasional wholesale repetition of stories; one gets the feeling that DeMaio liked them so much he wanted to experiment with different ways of presenting them, but I'd have preferred a greater amount of original material. It is disappointing, as it jars with the otherwise excellent work seen here. \n\nAnother minor niggle are the 'pre-gaps'; there are long breaks in between songs, disrupting the flow of the work in a way that irritates, and makes the whole album sound a more disjointed collection than it should, given the well-handled application of the theme elsewhere. Then there are a some genuinely weak tracks: 'Loki God of Fire' is heavy and powerful, but lacks the melodic weight that the rest of the work displays in abundance; 'Blood Brothers' is embarrasingly homo-erotic (literally); and 'Die for Metal' - whilst being enjoyable enough piece of typical Manowar ego-wanking in and of itself - simply does not fit with the serious nature of the rest of the album.\n\nIn conclusion, a flawed masterpiece. Manowar's bravery and their superlative presentation of the matierial are to be commended, but some aspects of the delivery falter. One final note: do not buy this if you think that a distorted guitar is the only criteria for good music. Do not buy this if you have no love for epic myths and heroic fantasy. Do not buy this if you cannot handle music that ostentatoiusly wears its heart on its sleeve. Otherwise, go get it immediately; daring should always be rewarded.\n",
        "\nManowar\u2019s major label debut brought their self-styled brand of bass-driven, ear-splitting, macho heavy metal to a wider audience, raising concerns among long-time fans that their favourite stupid-but-excellent band had sold out to the same faceless institution they had assaulted in earlier songs such as \u2018All Men Play on 10.\u2019 Clearly aware of this, Manowar lays rest to such fears in their customary way with the single \u2018Blow Your Speakers,\u2019 in which Eric Adams yells his love of true metal and hatred of mainstream labels against a catchy, Village People-style backing chorus and stilted guitars. Something here is awry.\n\nReleased three years after the last of Manowar\u2019s previous four albums, which were released in rapid succession, as detailed in my review for \u2018Sign of the Hammer,\u2019 the \u2018Fighting the World\u2019 album likely represents the greatest disappointment of their career. It isn\u2019t their worst album by far, as the few releases of the past decade have all been disappointing in unique ways, but it represents a significant drop in quality and an unappreciated change in direction from the dark and epic heavy metal of their earlier efforts towards something resembling, in places, the \u2018false metal\u2019 the band boasts so much hatred for. Whether this was due to pressure from Atlantic Records to create something easier to sell is unclear, though it must have become obvious soon after that only those with a certain frame of mind were going to buy Manowar records in the first place, and the band should essentially be allowed to do their inexplicably popular thing uninterrupted.\n\nThematically it\u2019s much the same as everything bass player and songwriter Joey DeMaio puts out, a mix of songs set in the present day of the metal-loving, bike-riding East Coast, and tales of battle fought in ancient history. There\u2019s even a song about Vietnam which harks back to the debut album, and as usual a couple of pieces glorifying Manowar\u2019s fans and the band itself. Anyone who had followed Manowar up to this point would recognise the usual shift in style from straightforward metal anthems in the first, \u2018present day\u2019 side of the album to the more grandiose style of the later songs that continues the style the band excels at the most. With this significant split between styles, the album is structured similarly to the classic debut \u2018Battle Hymns,\u2019 but most of the material sadly falls short of its predecessor. It\u2019s notable, and disappointing, that the only truly excellent song here is the epic \u2018Defender,\u2019 which I discovered years later was written way back in the glorious era of \u2018Into Glory Ride,\u2019 but jettisoned from that album for issues of space.\n\n1. Fighting the World\n2. Blow Your Speakers\n3. Carry On\n4. Violence and Bloodshed\n5. Defender\n6. Drums of Doom\n7. Holy War\n8. Master of Revenge\n9. Black Wind, Fire and Steel\n\nThe first four tracks have a noticeably different audience than the later songs, and it\u2019s clear they were placed at the beginning, as usual with Manowar releases, to provide something more straightforward for newcomers that won\u2019t put them off persevering to the later, more seasoned territory. Not that there isn\u2019t an awful lot to put people off in these arrogant and hypocritical heavy metal anthems, which display a far more commercial side of the band not heard since the opening songs of \u2018Battle Hymns,\u2019 before the band found its feet. \u2018Fighting the World\u2019 itself is a medium pace rocker with lyrics that are too embarrassing even to be considered amusing in the traditional Manowar sense (\u2018stripes on a tiger don\u2019t wash away / Manowar\u2019s made of steel, not clay\u2019), and even in terms of the music that these lyrics uncharacteristically overshadow to a large degree, the plodding drum beat, predictable guitar riff and overly repetitive chorus isn\u2019t what listeners have come to expect from a Manowar opener. \u2018Blow Your Speakers\u2019 is even worse, and the music video was placed in VH1\u2019s list of \u2018Most Awesomely Bad Metal Songs,\u2019 though for the long-time Manowar fan it\u2019s more of a crushing disappointment than a cheesy laugh. It\u2019s clear that this is a re-tread of the older song \u2018Metal Daze,\u2019 but the backing chorus, mentioned earlier, is many times worse, and once again the lyrics are abominable (\u2018I wrote a letter to the MTV / Said \u201cwhat\u2019s going on, don\u2019t you care about me?\u201d\u2019). This pair of slow, preachy dance floor songs (presumably the result of the lyric, \u2018people want music to get \u2019em movin\u2019), lacks the energy and compelling sincerity of Manowar\u2019s traditional shorter songs, and makes an unforgivably poor start to the album.\n\n\u2018Carry On\u2019 is a slight improvement, and works alright as a cheesy eighties metal song complete with TV game show solo, but still isn\u2019t what the album needs to get on track. Notably, it\u2019s Manowar\u2019s first real foray into the rousing crowd chant style that would appear on many releases hereafter, beginning with a plodding drum and Adams\u2019 irresistible vocals before breaking into a speedier riff for the verses and returning in the chorus. I have a soft spot for this song, but it\u2019s still essentially crap. Things continue to improve, slowly but surely, with the excitingly titled \u2018Violence and Bloodshed,\u2019 promising the aggression of some of Manowar\u2019s finest songs and delivering this to an extent. The drastically improved production quality of all albums released hereafter makes this song sound stilted and unfulfilled by comparison, as we\u2019re not hearing the full effect a live performance would provide, but it\u2019s still a step in the right direction at last. Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d delivers his first notable riff of the album and creates quite a cacophony, while Eric Adams is at his vocal best in both the driving verses and excellent chorus, which sees him increase the pitch of his wail incrementally after each power chord.\n\n\u2018Defender,\u2019 the finest song on the album, takes the listener back to an undisclosed time of warfare for the remainder of the performance, and is a fine example of a slow, epic song executed to perfection. The late Orson Welles provides narration as he did for the similarly excellent \u2018Dark Avenger\u2019 on the debut album, recorded four years earlier for the original version of the song in which time Welles had passed away, and his steady, deep tone contrasts excellently with Eric Adams\u2019 high singing, especially when the two voices of \u2018father and son\u2019 are pitted against each other in the finale. It\u2019s touching in a very simplistic way, as a young warrior reads a letter written by his late father explaining why he had to leave and ultimately die in service of his kingdom/country/warlord, and the boy promises to follow his example. Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d gives a nice solo, and the bass and drum rhythm is vital in holding the whole thing together, but this is very clearly a song dominated and led by the two great vocal performances, the higher one of which acts almost like a guitar solo in itself.\n\n\u2018Drums of Doom\u2019 is nothing more than a short drum solo designed to introduce the next song, complete with the sound effects of horses galloping that begin what will later become an obsession with inserting sound samples into the music. The best thing about this song is that drummer Scott Columbus\u2019 simplistic and non-flamboyant performance replaces any lengthy bass solo track that might have made its way onto the album like all others before it (and most afterwards). \u2018Holy War\u2019 returns to the battle metal sound of Manowar\u2019s great Viking epics, beginning softly before erupting into a bass-dominated and highly energetic performance that can\u2019t help but be seen, in hindsight, like a direct precursor to \u2018Hail and Kill\u2019 on the subsequent release. This is easily one of the best songs on the album, but is spoiled slightly by the decision to make tracks six to nine flow together in something of a contrived suite, meaning that the song can\u2019t really be played in isolation without sounding odd at the beginning and end as it catches the tail-end of other songs.\n\nIt\u2019s worse that the following song, \u2018Master of Revenge,\u2019 is merely a one-minute prelude to the final song in which Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d plays a repetitive riff over Adams\u2019 wailing vocals, something that would sound good as part of a longer piece but doesn\u2019t really work here. Closer \u2018Black Wind, Fire and Steel\u2019 is a bit of an over-rated album closer as it lies uncomfortably between epic and speedy territory and, as usual for Manowar finales, takes an excruciating amount of time to actually finish once the song is over, including a ridiculous wailing section towards the close. The bulk of the song itself is pretty good, led by DeMaio\u2019s hyper clanging bass and putting Eric Adams through his paces as his verse vocals have to keep up. The chorus is incredibly memorable and catchy, if a little meaningless, and if it wasn\u2019t for the regrettable finale this would be on even par with \u2018Holy War,\u2019 both of which suffer slightly thanks to whoever came up with the seguing idea.\n\nIt\u2019s both sad and embarrassing that Manowar had such a bad start on their major label debut, failing to live up their own standards and slogans as they struggle to weakly cobble together something more commercially viable, but at the same time decide to go overboard on the ridiculous lyrics and attitude that are the most off-putting aspect of even their best work. Without the re-use of \u2018Defender,\u2019 this album would truly be feeble, and no amount of studio trickery and fake song suites can elevate it to the classic status of their earlier releases (tracks six to nine are all different songs, and no amount of cross-fading is going to convince people otherwise). The performances from DeMaio and Adams are superb on occasion, compared to the fairly average contributions from Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d and Columbus, but this album feels like a severe mis-step even after the slightly directionless \u2018Sign of the Hammer.\u2019 The following year\u2019s definitive \u2018Kings of Metal\u2019 would solidify Manowar\u2019s ambitions and objectives forever after, making them appear even stupider in some ways but also much more focused and determined to spread their message, making \u2018Fighting the World\u2019 an insignificant and hopefully forgettable stepping stone between the Manowar of the early eighties and the band that continues to grow ever more elaborate today.\n\nI really should talk about the album cover... no, I think it\u2019s fairly self-explanatory.\n",
        "\nNew York\u2019s Manowar have always been quick to praise their European brothers of metal, the continent housing their largest fan-base and offering them headlining events at major metal festivals, compared to the lukewarm reception of their home country. Although later releases such as \u2018Kings of Metal\u2019 would attempt to balance out the praise for all European nations (it even name-checks Wales), their third album, or more specifically its titular song, is a celebration of the nation that created heavy metal and provided Manowar with the opportunity to hear the call. The country\u2019s name is... oh yes, it\u2019s in the title.\n\n\u2018Hail to England\u2019 is in some ways a disappointing follow-up to \u2018Into Glory Ride,\u2019 but this was perhaps inevitable, the band having all but exhausted their epic sound across its seven tracks. At a shorter thirty minutes of music, this third release at first seems to display signs of either laziness or a writer\u2019s block, yet the release of \u2018Sign of the Hammer\u2019 later in the same year indicates that it was presumably more due to pressure from the record label, or for financial necessity, to churn these records out in quick succession. \u2018Hail to England\u2019 includes a couple of immortal Manowar classics, particularly the first song which still beats anything recorded by Scandinavian Viking metal bands in its short and simple piece of Norse mythology, but for the most part it seems to be a re-tread of the more successful aspects of the first two albums. Still, it\u2019s only fussy people like me who will really be irked by this lack of progress, and for the average Manowar or heavy metal fan this is an enjoyable, if unremarkable and noticeably short, album, and one that can easily be dealt with track-by-track.\n\n1. Blood of My Enemies\n2. Each Dawn I Die\n3. Kill With Power\n4. Hail to England\n5. Army of Immortals\n6. Black Arrows\n7. Bridge of Death\n\n\u2018Blood of My Enemies\u2019 is the primary reason that I still bother with this album, as it\u2019s one of my favourite Manowar songs. Unlike the previous album, attention seems to have been made to keep the song lengths more acceptable, with the exception of the monster final track, and the shorter, edited style really works to keep this first song from becoming tedious. The chorus is a somewhat surprising mellow sing-along, but incessantly catchy, and Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d puts in some of his best guitar work in the album\u2019s trademark Viking song. \u2018Each Dawn I Die\u2019 is less impressive, and begins something of a slump, wrongly placed as a slow song at this early point to suck the energy from the great opener and remaining largely unmemorable even after several listens. The main riff is cool and clanky in the Manowar fashion, accompanied by DeMaio\u2019s bass which is more prominent on this album, but overall this has the unfortunate distinction of being the first Manowar song that can truly be regarded as filler.\n\n\u2018Kill With Power\u2019 is next, bringing back the speed and attempting to push the heaviness further than before as it approaches thrash metal, but on the whole I find this popular song a little unconvincing, and at times irritating. The customary ridiculous lyrics aside (\u2018Kill With Power?\u2019), the song sacrifices strong development and interest in the pursuit of this harder edge that it doesn\u2019t quite achieve, due to the slightly weak production values and the musicians\u2019 incompatible playing style, but the greatest annoyance is the irritating whistling effect produced by the guitar after each line of the chorus. It was a nice intention for the band to try to keep up with their country\u2019s thrashers, but ultimately their true home is in pure old British heavy metal, the subject matter of the fourth song, \u2018Hail to England,\u2019 which also seems to indicate that they wish to gallop to London Town (as with most Manowar songs, this is set in the past) and claim the throne. Relying on a traditional heavy metal style there really isn\u2019t much that excites me in this one, but the verses possess the great energy of the band on top form, and the unison chanting in the chorus manages to be a vast improvement over that of the horrible \u2018Metal Daze\u2019 on the first album. Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d provides a great lead guitar riff that weaves its way around the entire song, and not once is there a rubbish attempt made to play \u2018Greensleeves\u2019 or some other song that American people might assume plays over England\u2019s green and pleasant land; Manowar has too much respect.\n\nAs usual with Manowar albums, the final few tracks attempt something grander and more eloquent, though in this instance the results are less impressive, sadly forming the weaker half of the material. \u2018Army of Immortals\u2019 is the band\u2019s tribute to their fans (they\u2019re big on praise in this album), but only the chorus manages to rise above mediocrity in this re-hash of the previous album\u2019s ideas. Things become really bleak with the return of DeMaio\u2019s bass solo spot, avoided on the previous album but usually a staple of Manowar releases, and \u2018Black Arrows\u2019 has the distinction of being the least impressive of the lot. Beginning with a silly spoken word introduction distorted through some gadget or other that will resurface on the final song, DeMaio bellows that each of his notes will be as a black arrow sent straight through the hearts of all those who play false metal. It\u2019s too depressingly awful to even be funny in the way the later \u2018Kings of Metal\u2019 album is hilarious, and the next few minutes of discordant bass masturbation should be confined only to the most hardcore DeMaio fan.\n\nFortunately, \u2018Bridge of Death\u2019 brings the quality back towards the end as a grand finale, but doesn\u2019t live up to the high quality of the previous two albums with its crawling pace and lack of real progression. Eric Adams is fantastic in the chorus, holding the high notes with even greater ease than in the last album\u2019s \u2018Gates of Valhalla,\u2019 but the return of the distorted voice processor, which sees Adams invocate the power of Satan in an uncharacteristic and pointless move that will only have invited criticism, keeps this from being a truly enjoyable song. It also has nothing to do with Monty Python, which adds to the disappointment.\n\n\u2018Hail to England\u2019 is one of Manowar\u2019s more well-known, but weaker releases, perhaps viewed as a classic for its fortunate production in the middle of heavy metal\u2019s popularity when people worldwide seemed to crave the generic heavy rock that it offers. The more impressive elements of this album will have gone over such peoples\u2019 heads, but provide the only real reason for me to keep listening to this otherwise forgettable album, contributing \u2018Blood of My Enemies\u2019 to the Manowar canon along with a number of comparatively worthless, but nonetheless enjoyable pieces. \u2018Sign of the Hammer\u2019 would be released later the same year, and effectively fills in the obvious gaps of this album while managing to be the stronger of the two releases, yet even though many retailers such as Amazon sell these early albums for incredibly low prices of around \u00a33.99 \u2013 meaning that they could all be bought to compliment each other for the same price as a single album from another band \u2013 it\u2019s still a largely weak effort when viewed in the proper historical context. That said, it\u2019s a whole lot better than some of the rubbish they would release later...\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s often cheesy, it\u2019s gratuitously sexist and geeky, and it\u2019s got a photo of the band pretending to be barbarians on the front, but Manowar\u2019s second album has to be among my favourite albums of all time. In the whole history of the world\u2019s albums \u2013 ever! I\u2019m quite clearly insane, but at least I didn\u2019t opt for one of their more ridiculous later albums like \u2018Louder Than Hell.\u2019\n\nPicking up right where \u2018Battle Hymns\u2019 left off, Manowar\u2019s second album marks a clear decision from the band (led by bass player Joey DeMaio) to embrace the epic sound of the debut\u2019s latter half, mostly abandoning more simplistic hard rock anthems in favour of pursuing this innovative sound. It\u2019s this dedicated focus on perfecting a style, found in various stages across the album which, like the debut, improves as it goes, that makes this a more solid and exciting album than any of Manowar\u2019s later efforts, which mostly relied on safe, tried-and-tested techniques. The subject matter takes an appropriate turn from the debut also, beginning with another song about a juvenile biker before skidding off completely to deal with battles, swords and Viking mythology for the remainder of the record. The lyrics are less absurdly funny than on Manowar\u2019s other releases, apart from the classic opening dialogue where the Warlord is discovered deflowering an angry couple\u2019s sixteen-year-old daughter and has to flee the shouting father, and as the most sensible of Manowar\u2019s releases it\u2019s perhaps the one most appealing to newcomers. Unless, of course, they\u2019re into the band for the absurdity alone, in which case they will be justly disappointed.\n\nThe predominant sound of \u2018Into Glory Ride\u2019 is that of a slow and heavy march, newcomers Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d on guitar and Scott Columbus on drums completing the band\u2019s classic line-up and providing the memorable riffs and rhythms that were lacking in the debut. Songs such as \u2018Hatred\u2019 and \u2018Secret of Steel\u2019 crawl along with the crushing heaviness of Black Sabbath\u2019s classic debut album, Eric Adams holding the high notes in some of his best performances, while others such as the excellent \u2018Revelation\u2019 are among the fastest and most energetic Manowar would record until the late 80s. With the exception of \u2018Warlord,\u2019 which stands out as a more deliberately simplistic single, all of the songs are longer than the heavy metal average and more complex, the later songs particularly featuring several major breaks that could almost make them different songs as part of an epic suite. The sound certainly won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste, Eric Adams\u2019 powerful wails going overboard in places such as the soft introduction to \u2018Gates of Valhalla,\u2019 and as usual there are several references that openly celebrate the more ravishing aspects of Viking invasion, but as a work of epic metal this album wouldn\u2019t be beaten until Bathory created so-called Viking metal a number of years later, based on many of the ideas found here.\n\n1. Warlord\n2. Secret of Steel\n3. Gloves of Metal\n4. Gates of Valhalla\n5. Hatred\n6. Revelation (Death\u2019s Angel)\n7. March for Revenge (By the Soldiers of Death)\n\nThe primary failing of this album is evidently that it\u2019s fairly short, at least compared to modern releases, lasting the Manowar average of just under forty minutes. Insistent that the sound quality of the record should not be compromised or diluted in any way, the band left off the excellent song \u2018Defender\u2019 that was recorded in this session, which featured a second celebrity guest monologue from Orson Welles after \u2018Dark Avenger\u2019 on the first album, instead releasing it as a limited edition single before a re-recorded version finally found its way onto 1987\u2019s otherwise terrible \u2018Fighting the World.\u2019 The addition of this song would have made this album even more impressive, though perhaps would have been an overkill of slowness for some metal fans, and it\u2019s to its credit that \u2018Into Glory Ride\u2019 manages to exude such incredible atmosphere simply from the standard rock instruments without any technical tomfoolery or attempts to incorporate a symphony. As mentioned earlier, \u2018Warlord\u2019 opens the album with a comical piece of drama (presumably unintentional, though I\u2019ve never been sure about this one) , performed as usual by laughably inept actors, before launching into a fun and catchy metal anthem that\u2019s up there with anything Judas Priest released in the same era. A marked improvement on the directly comparable songs from the debut album, namely \u2018Death Tone\u2019 and \u2018Fast Taker,\u2019 it\u2019s clear that the band gels together in its new, fixed line-up far better than was possible with the drafted players on the earlier release.\n\n\u2018Secret of Steel\u2019 immediately launches listeners into the album\u2019s preferred style, and along with its successor \u2018Gloves of Metal\u2019 is a slow and forceful piece that remains far too powerful throughout to ever become dull. The chorus is one of Manowar\u2019s best, evolving seamlessly from the verses and featuring some innovative guitar from Ross \u201cThe Boss,\u201d whose clanky melodies would define many of the band\u2019s finest songs, though it inevitably becomes repetitive towards the end. \u2018Gloves of Metal\u2019 is similar in approach, but more amusing for its celebration of the heavy metal lifestyle through its clothing (not shallow at all), replete with great heavy riffs but not too remarkable after the second song, mostly memorable for the first instance of the band referring to themselves as \u2018the Metal Kings.\u2019 Attempting to top its predecessors in the epic stakes, something the album will continue to do throughout, \u2018Gates of Valhalla\u2019 follows a similar style to the classic older song \u2018Battle Hymn\u2019 with a melodic, quiet introduction led by Adams in his first real performance as a tenor, before falling back on the familiar Manowar sound, slightly faster here. It\u2019s a great song, if a little lacking towards the end, and the first of a great many Viking epics to be penned by DeMaio, culminating in this year\u2019s Norse concept release \u2018Gods of War.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hated\u2019 is something of an acquired taste, expanding on the slow and heavy style of the second and third songs and pushing it just that little bit too far in the reliable Manowar manner. It can be gruelling and even painful at times, but in the right circumstances the crawling chorus can be just as effective as any of the faster pieces, the guitar work of Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d managing to owe a debt to Black Sabbath without sounding in any way derivative, a true feat. After this exhausting slump (which perhaps should have been replaced by the excluded \u2018Defender\u2019 to achieve the same effect, if I\u2019m going to take a Fantasy Manowar angle), the album kicks into its most energetic song yet, with the incredible \u2018Revelation (Death\u2019s Angel),\u2019 my all-time favourite Manowar song, charging through and decimating anything they have recorded before or since. The chorus is perfect, Adams wailing with appropriate gusto over the galloping drums and bass while Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d noodles around his guitar, the song beating Iron Maiden\u2019s classic \u2018The Trooper\u2019 in conjuring a war-torn scene and really taking the listener along for the bumpy steedback ride. Both \u2018Revelation\u2019 and the final song, \u2018March for Revenge (By the Soldiers of Death),\u2019 display a self-aware grandeur in their (bracketed) sub-titles, and both utilise their full running times to build upon the songs and experiment, unlike some of the earlier tracks which simply lasted for a long time. \u2018March for Revenge,\u2019 like \u2018Gates of Valhalla,\u2019 takes a drastic turn part way through from a slow introduction to a rip-roaring finale that it\u2019s impossible not to sing along to, even if the lyrics are \u2018maim and kill them \u2013 take the women and chiiiiildren.\u2019\n\nMost Manowar albums improve towards the end, as more easily palatable singles make way for experimental epics, but only with \u2018Into Glory Ride\u2019 does the onward march truly improve throughout, the possible exception of \u2018Hatred\u2019 only coming with someone unaccustomed to such a slow piece, and itself forming a necessary bridge. \u2018Revelation\u2019 and \u2018March for Revenge\u2019 are both so irresistibly catchy and energetic that you should be sure nobody\u2019s around to see you enthusiastically joining in, while the earlier songs such as \u2018Gloves of Metal\u2019 are slow and methodical head-banging heaven. The band\u2019s follow-up \u2018Hail to England\u2019 would prove less satisfying and more of a rushed effort, attempting to mimic the style of this sophomore release but ultimately failing to recapture the thunder. Perhaps it was divine intervention from Thor, or simply the result of an incredibly focused year, but \u2018Into Glory Ride\u2019 remains one of the most definitive heavy metal albums alongside \u2018Black Sabbath,\u2019 \u2018Screaming for Vengeance\u2019 and \u2018The Number of the Beast.\u2019\n",
        "\nManowar\u2019s debut is widely regarded as a classic of early 80s heavy metal before the spawning of \u2018false metal\u2019 glam acts, as well as Manowar\u2019s own increasing movement towards self-parody, robbed the genre of its credibility. That\u2019s not to say that \u2018Battle Hymns,\u2019 for all its legacy, is an entirely sombre and sinister affair, featuring the band\u2019s usual ridiculous lyrics on numerous themes from bikes to heavy metal to ancient battles, but sung over music that remains true to the spirit and sound of early, simplistic metal without any of the pompous excess that would later turn the band into a laughing stock.\n\nCollecting most of the songs recorded by the band in the previous two years, \u2018Battle Hymns\u2019 is something of a mixed bag with songs heading in often wildly different directions, the earlier pieces tending more towards a party atmosphere in the vein of Kiss, but with more testosterone, and the final three songs experimenting with a more epic sound that had never been attempted before, but has since spawned numerous sub-genres within heavy metal. Eric Adams\u2019 distinctive wail hasn\u2019t reached its full power yet despite a valiant effort to hold notes at the end of many songs, and like many bands\u2019 first releases it\u2019s entertaining to hear how much younger he sounds than on their definitive \u2018Kings of Metal.\u2019 Joey DeMaio is the band\u2019s founder, primary song-writer and bass player, and there are no limits to his ego. Not only does DeMaio intersperse most songs with complex and foregrounded bass riffs over the guitars, but the penultimate song is handed over to him entirely as he speeds through the William Tell Overture with no thought for the safety of his fingers or the attention span of the listener, also writing the band\u2019s title song that explains their English origins (DeMaio was a roadie and tech for Black Sabbath, where he \u2018heard the call\u2019) and the steps that led to them becoming, clearly, the most powerful force on the planet.\n\nThe remainder of the band comprises musicians who would both soon depart, making way for the classic line-up. Ross Funicello\u2019s guitar work is good, but is noticeably weak compared to DeMaio\u2019s bass work, requiring the talents of his later replacement Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d to provide more effective competition. As such, most of the riffs are very simplistic to the point of sounding derivative of other bands, and the guitar solos are nothing spectacular, though the long-forgotten Funicello admirably keeps up to speed on the faster pieces such as \u2018Manowar,\u2019 and employs interesting effects in the songs that follow. Scott Columbus\u2019 predecessor on the drum kit is Donnie Hamzik, drafted in from a newspaper advertisement put out by DeMaio and Adams and doing his job as promised, but once again failing to make a lasting impression. There\u2019s nothing here to rival the drums on later songs such as \u2018March for Revenge,\u2019 but for the more straightforward songs that dominate this album, Hamzik is essentially required to play fast and hard, and he does so competently.\n\n1. Death Tone\n2. Metal Daze\n3. Fast Taker\n4. Shell Shock\n5. Manowar\n6. Dark Avenger\n7. William\u2019s Tale\n8. Battle Hymn\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there is a very clear split in this album between the two styles of song, made even more obvious by the original double-sided vinyl than the CD version. Opener \u2018Death Tone\u2019 is a fairly fast and energetic song in which the character of a juvenile biker spouts some truly abominable lyrics (\u2018I give some square the finger,\u2019 etc.), and is very similar both lyrically and musically to \u2018Fast Taker,\u2019 the appropriately faster speed of which makes it the more exciting of the two, as well as its more original guitar work. The song between, \u2018Metal Daze,\u2019 is the first of oh-so-many anthems dedicated to the glory of heavy metal, and easily my least favourite song on the album due to its unwise and unconvincing chorus chanting. Later live versions are much more credible, as the crowd sings along instead of this stilted-sounding noise, but it\u2019s also incredibly uneventful and dull, especially at this early point. \u2018Shell Shock\u2019 is one of the more memorable songs, describing the debilitating after-effects of Vietnam from the perspective of an ex-soldier but also scorning those who escaped the war, represented by the despised \u2018businessman at home.\u2019 I\u2019m sure there are several thousand more emotive and worthwhile songs about the Vietnam conflict out there, but with its cool riff, incredibly catchy rhythm and fine chorus, this would still be my favourite. This first, uneven \u2018half\u2019 of the album is concluded with the band\u2019s titular song \u2018Manowar,\u2019 which strives to be even faster and more full of energy than those that have come before it, and succeeds to some extent. At only three-and-a-half minutes long it feels a little unsatisfying and brief, despite another great chorus, but the band would make sure to record many more testaments to their own greatness over the next twenty-five years and beyond. Excellent.\n\nWhile the first half of the album effectively offers a slightly rougher and more energetic version of the sound Judas Priest had moved beyond two years previously, it\u2019s the remaining songs of the album (with one very definite exception that is easy to spot) that elevate this record to classic and influential status, beginning the epic sound that the band would embrace more fully on their second album as they began to deal with Viking themes. \u2018Dark Avenger\u2019 is a brilliant song of two halves, the first a slow, dark and foreboding bass and guitar instrumental of sorts overlaid with narration from the inimitable diaphragm of Orson Welles. The dialogue is fairly silly and simplistic fantasy pap, detailing the story of the eponymous dark avenger riding up from Hell on his demon horse Black Death, before an escalating \u2018woah\u2019 from Eric Adams rises to an ear-splitting scream and the song hits its stride. The final few minutes are back in familiar territory, but with grander aspirations, and some humorously sexist lyrics that the band encourage us to sing along to, not for the last time. The bass instrumental \u2018William\u2019s Tale\u2019 then proceeds to waste a couple of minutes in an extremely shoddy sounding display of fast string-plucking to an over-familiar tune, before the album delivers its final and most satisfying punch in the form of the semi-titular \u2018Battle Hymn.\u2019 Originally recorded for Manowar\u2019s demo release, this song takes the slow and heavy approach of \u2018Dark Avenger\u2019 and mixes in some lighter sections of acoustic guitar and even a very drastic piano break, which ends up sounding a little too out of place and lullaby-like amidst all the death and destruction. It\u2019s one of the purest Manowar classics, and the song that launched a thousand thousand geeky fantasy metal bands.\n\nManowar\u2019s debut is far from being their strongest album, being beaten very satisfyingly by the next few subsequent releases before the band\u2019s deterioration with their move to a major label towards the end of the decade. It nevertheless remains one of their most enduringly popular, especially among non-hardcore fans who can appreciate its greater simplicity in the era of NWOB(A)HM, the New Wave of British (and American) Heavy Metal, and who would likely find the greater excesses of all their subsequent albums a little off-putting. I enjoy this album for its diversity, but with the far greater things they would produce soon hereafter it\u2019s not an album I often listen to in full, often opting for a quick blast of \u2018Dark Avenger\u2019 or \u2018Shell Shock,\u2019 two very different songs, one of which will always be ideally suited to my mood at any given time.\n",
        "\nI know may people consider \u2018Hail To England\u2019 and \u2018Into glory Ride\u2019 to be the best Manowar albums. I myself have always preferred this one, \u2018Kings Of Metal\u2019. I have several reasons for this. First of all the album is very diverse and combines most of the Manowar styles in just the right amount. We have up tempo speed metal, catchy mid tempo pounders, epic ballads and even sleazy metal in true \u2018Fighting The World\u2019 fashion but without overdoing it. Most other Manowar album emphasise too much on one or two specific styles and therefore become more monotone than \u2018Kings Of Metal\u2019. Secondly the quality of the individual songs is very high.\n\nOpener \u2018Wheels Of Fire\u2019 is speedy Manowar at its best. This song has balls and is extremely catchy. The intro is predictable but does the trick and is nicely swallowed by the song. The title track is a decent kind of sleazy sing-a-long song but the best song in this style has got to be \u2018Kingdom Come\u2019 which is more epic and dynamic. \n\n\u2018Heart of Steel\u2019 is a very good heroic ballad with an excellent chorus but \u2018The Crown and The Rings\u2019 is even better! What a classic this one is. No wonder a lot of bands (try to) cover this song is various styles. On these two songs you can really hear how good Eric Adams actually is. One of the best voices in eighties metal. \u2018Hail and Kill\u2019 is a very dynamic epic sing-a-long which again is very catchy yet powerful. \u2018Blood Of The Kings\u2019 however is a top class epic metal anthem and the song that actually got me into Manowar.\n\nOnly two songs never caught my attention, being the bass solo \u2018Flight Of The Bumblebee\u2019 and the tale \u2018The Warriors Prayer\u2019. The band musically sounds very strong on this album and the production is close to flawless for 1988 standards. It proved to be the last album with Ross The Boss on guitar and I have missed him forever since.\n",
        "\nThe kings of metal released another album, this time we get a live rendition of songs of (almost) every album they've put out so far, and on the second disc an extensive list of songs from their latest album, Gods of war (no surprises this album is called Gods of war live, as it is a recording of one of their tour dates for the same album). This album was recorded in N\u00c3\u00bcrnberg, Germany (mentioned only at the end of Black wind, fire and steel).\n\nFirst, the overall sound and quality. Manowar/Joey deMaio and his sound crew really know how to put out the best sound they can get, no doubt about that: every instrument is clearly audible and every note can be heard. Now, the quality of playing is another thing: even though we all know Eric Adams is one of the, if not THE greatest metal singer of all time, he's having either some troubles with his glorious vocal cords or he doesn't know how to use all the power from the sound system or something like that, because he uses the first three songs messing around with his voice, going from low and almost grunting to some of his trademark high pitched screams before singing the songs like he should. After that, the quality of the music overall improves a lot and we get Manowar at their finest, performing some classic and thought to never-return-again-in-live shows-songs, such as Gloves of metal, Each dawn I die, Mountains and many other classic Manowar songs, screaming to be played live at least once.\n\nThis gets me to the song selection. As I said above, we almost couldn't get any better, as every album is represented here, with a large section (almost the entire second disc) from their latest album. Having chosen songs from their oldest albums (Ross the Boss-era), it almost forces DeMaio dusting all his basses off and preparing them for some serious bass shredding, which can be heard in, for instance, the magnificent Mountains, as well as the renewed rendition of William Tell's march, as heard in Son of William's tale.\n\nKarl Logan and Scott Columbus shine here too, with Logan proving in many songs why he is a member of Manowar for over 13 years: he shreds like a maniac on songs like The oath and The gods made heavy metal, but puts down some soothing guitar work, like in the aforementioned Mountains. Of course his playing is far from flawless, but it makes it all the more real and shows his skills even better (better a bit flawed but played with emotion than Yngwie-esque shredding played with perfection, but without any balls at all).\n\nThird, the audience and the communication with them. Ouch, they seriously fail in this part. I don't know whether this was cut out of the final mix or Adams nor DeMaio didn't communicate with their really energetic and enthousiastic audience at all, but it's not here. I really hope it was cut out, because Manowar is known for their very strong fanbase and the communication with them (I read in the booklet of the silver edition of Hail to England that their manager at the time met with their fans and asked them which songs the bands should play at the next concert, and they did). Too bad it's just not here. Only Joey plays with the crowd in his bass solo, but it's too short to save the rest of the album (nice solo, by the way; I've always been ambiguous about DeMaio's solo's: some of them are amazing, others are utter crap). The audience, by the way, is really out there and can be heard singing along many times, Eric Adams gives them a lot of room to fill in his lines, which they do with passion (and probably with their fists in the air).\n\nThe second disc. This is where we are treated (yes, treated) to material from the Gods of war-album, their not so good latest album. These songs played live is quite another story: they really shine here! The overall atmosphere of the selection of these songs is really dark and brooding and you almost feel the different emotions, told by the narrator. I sometimes got shivers and goosebumps, and I guess the fans did too. The 'bonus track', Die for metal, was already given to us on disc 1.\n\nOverall this is almost a prime example of how a live album should sound. I say 'almost', because there are several flaws, the biggest of them Eric Adam's vocal acobatics in the first three songs and in some moments later on, but a bigger issue than that is the lack of communication with the crowd.\n\nOn the other hand: the song selection is brilliant, giving the fans at least 1 song from every album, as well as the excellent selection and rendition of songs from the Gods of war-album. I'd say it's a must buy, not only for the fans but for every metal fan in general.\n\nHowever, if you want a full overview of what Manowar are capable of pulling off live, I suggest the DVD The day the Earth shook - The absolute power, which is a bit better IMHO.\n",
        "\nThis is the third live album from the kings of metal and, as the name suggests, it was recorded during the tour following their latest album. The sound itself is very good: Eric's voice is no longer drowned by the music and the crowd is clearly noticeable. \n\nThere are two discs in this album. The first disc features some classic songs (Manowar, Kings of metal) and a lot of early songs (Secret of steel, Holy war) while the second disc features songs from the Gods of war album. \n\nThe first disc is, in my opinion, the best of the two, because the early songs are really improved in their live version. You'll get an in your face and catchy song with Gloves of metal, a slow and powerful one with Each dawn I die (the bass is excellent), a magnificent and powerful one with Mountains, a fast and furious one with The oath ... Not to mention the classic Secret of steel, a superb epic song that will stick in your head for weeks. As you can see, it's a very complete selection of songs, an excellent overview of Manowar's past. However the bass solo, Son of William's tale, is very poor compared to his fellow in hell on Wheels (Black arrows) : The melodies are uninteresting and not very varied. \n\nThere are also some more recent tracks in the CD. Call to arms and Die for metal are not excellent on this live, but Warriors of the world is very good, full of power and energy. The crowd is very active too. \n\nThen comes the second disc. The songs are not bad, but the real problem is that you already know them! The songs don't change much when you compare them to their studio version, and there's not a lot of crowd participation. \n\nAlso, I found disappointing that we don't hear communication between the band and the enthusiastic crowd, like in Warriors of the world in Hell on wheels. \n\nSo here's my final verdict: Gods of war live is a superb album because it includes a lot of excellent early Manowar songs in the first disc, while the second disc is correct, but a little bit boring if you own the studio album.\n",
        "\nThe band's first album for six years following \"Louder Then Hell,\" I had mixed expectations about this album. The first thing I noticed is the artwork. Kickass as usual... dare I say it.... Manowar's best? But I am here to review the music, so let me continue: \n\nThe album opens up with \"Call To Arms\" which is both heavy and catchy. A little different than you'd expect from the classic Manowar releases, but it's good. Halfway through the album we get the title track. \"Warriors Of The World\" is definitely the standout track here. Heavy, catchy as hell, with flawless instruments. The beginning of the song is really quite amazing, and there is no arguing the fact that the way the bass, guitar and drums work together is quite flawless. \n\nA fact I feel is rather necessary to mention is that after the kickass opener, we are given 6 songs that are extremely.... slow? Half of them being ballads. I personally have nothing against ballads, but except for \"Swords In The Wind\" and \"Fight For Freedom,\" they are all pretty much forgettable. \n\nAfter the soft songs, we have, as mentioned, the title track, and following that are three heavy songs. I personally don't like the track order on this album. Why is the first half slow and ballad-y, while the second half heavy and catchy? Manowar could have mixed the songs around a bit, but meh...\n\nSo to sum it up? The album does offer some amazing Manowar material, and Eric Adams' voice shines on this record. If both halfs were equally amazing, I'd give this album a 90+ without a doubt. But the truth is, the fillers REALLY bring it down.... Sorry Manowar.\n\n-Marcin C.\n",
        "\nThis was the first Manowar album that I ever purchased, I bought it on nothing but good reviews of the band and hoped that it would live up to my expectations.\n\nIt didn't. I placed it into the CD player and listened in horror as I suddenly realised that I had thrown \u00a38 out of the window. Wheels of Fire was a dull, unsophisticated song with horrible disjointed vocals. Kings of metal was a piece of selfagrandising crap with arrogant lyrics and a dull sing along chorus. Heart of Steel was a boring soft song with stupid lyrics about riding comets and I could barely stomach the chorus. Sting of the Bumblebee was a pathetic piece of wankery which divolved into a horrid mess of wretching guitars at the end. The Crown and the Ring was far too soft, took too long to get going and had terribly cheesy lyrics. Kingdom Come was just some average little metal song with nothing special to possibly offer the world. Pleasure Slave was a funny but awfully sexist number with the worst lyrics ever created. Hail and Kill had vomit inducing lyrics and a lame chorus. The Warriors Prayer was a stupid and utterly pointless piece of spoken word garbage that didn't belong anywhere near the world of metal.\n\nThen I heard Blood of the Kings... From the first smashing drum notes, intersecting beautifully with Adam's manic screams I knew I was in for one hell of a ride. The lyrics were spectacular, a song praising Europe for its fighting might with a chorus to die for. Epic guitar solos gave way to pounding drums and a galloping bass line to rival any Steve Harris number. \n\nI think something inside of me snapped when I listened to that song, I think that I began to understand jsut what Manowar were about and what they had set out to accomplish. Suddenly Wheels of Fire was a blistering speed metal song with clever lyrics and a wonderful chorus. Kings of Metal was a destructive romp with great bass and guitar lines. Heart of Steel suddenly transformed into a sublime ballad with uplifting lyrics and the greatest chorus known to man. Sting of the Bumblebee was a fitting testament to DeMaos awesome bass skills. The Crown and the Ring was another wonderful ballad with great lyrics and wonderful organ work. Kingdom Come was a no frills headbanger again with great lyrics and a great singalong. Pleasure Slave was still a piece of mysoganist crap. Hail and Kill on the other hand was a mighty song with a great chorus, sublime guitar work and wonderful vocals. The Warriors Prayer was a delicious and clever interlude designed to lull the listener into a false sense of security for the bombastic finale that was to follow and the already lauded Blood of the Kings. I sat and listened enthralled as Kings of Metal suddenly transformed into the best \u00a38 I have ever spent in my life.\n",
        "\nUm no, in a word. Manowar certainly were pounding into glory on the whirlwind created by their earlier releases but it seems that for this release they must have dismounted their horses/bikes/whatevers and started shuffling forwards very slowly. Oh sure there are some points where the band clearly started running and I think they must have caught a high speed train for Mountains but otherwise this is a release clearly lacking in power, might and above all any semblance of glory.\n\nMost of the songs are either dull and forgettable like The Oath which always makes me head straight for the \"skip\" button on my CD player because of its dull vocals, subdued guitar and boring solo; or just plain bad like Animals which has terrible sex based lyrics, a boring chorus and really, really quiet drumming. Even Thor (the Powerhead) and the title track fail to interest me after just a few plays and those are the type of song that I so enjoy on other Manowar albums, those being the cheesy, fantastical epics.\n\nThis time around Joey's solo piece is the vaunted Thunderpick and besides being far too long for its own good and having possibly the lamest name for a track ever it mainly falls flat due to it being so mundane. It really is just wankery with no real direction or catchy rhythm unlike the great William's Tale.\n\nThe album does however feature two songs that manage to partially pull it out of the cess pool of it's own existance. These being Guyana (The Cult of the Damned) and Mountains. The former dazles with it's immaculate guitar and bass lines and sumptuous vocals but the albums real centrepiece is Mountains. A beautiful pseudo-ballad that contains great bass work from Joey, inspiring lyrics sung with real emotion and obvious talent from Adams and although the guitar is not up there with Ross' performance in Guyana; Scott Columbus gives a great performance on the drums during the heavier parts of the song.\n\nThe main thing that manages to keep the album afloat and still worthy of the Manowar name is quite simply those two songs. The best part is however that those songs are the longest two on the entire album, both coming in at over seven minutes. So thats 14 minutes of sheer musical bliss and about 25 minutes of tat. Considering that it's still 14 minutes of great Manowar and you can pick this album up for a fiver (I did at least) I would still say that this is an album you should own but don't expect to get blown away.\n",
        "\n\u2018Kings of Metal\u2019 has all the makings of a self-consciously definitive Manowar album, like the Black Album was for Metallica. Now forming the centre of their discography, it does indeed represent pretty much everything Manowar is about: the good, and the incredibly bad. The style is a seamless blend of their earlier, more traditional heavy metal style, and the delusions of Wagnerian grandeur that have only increased in the twenty years since, culminating in the tedious embarrassment of their most recent concept effort \u2018Gods of War.\u2019 On first listening to \u2018Kings of Metal,\u2019 the same overarching themes appear to be present: songs of Odin, Viking conquest, and drinking thy last ale, but elsewhere the subject matter returns to the other characteristic Manowar staples with songs about bikes, women and the glory of Manowar itself. You would be hard pressed to find a more arrogant, chauvinistic and nerdy album even in the eighties metal scene, and while it\u2019s arguable whether this is Manowar at their finest, it certainly catches them at their most hilarious.\n\nThis was Manowar\u2019s second major label album after the previous year\u2019s disappointing \u2018Fighting the World,\u2019 and the band put their increased budget to use. The production is pretty excellent for an album of the eighties, surpassing the other major metal albums of that year, while an authentic choir of old European men provides the chorus for \u2018The Crown and the Ring.\u2019 This album effectively marks the end of an era, as it would be the final outing for guitarist Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d and drummer Scott Columbus, though the latter would return some years later, but also set the standard for all albums that came after, focusing heavily on the contrast between extremely loud and fast heavy metal and more calm and reflective pieces, all striving for the label of \u2018epic.\u2019 Although the album is let down by its numerous weak spots and bold but ludicrous experimentation, it still remains their last \u2018classic\u2019 album and stands out from the discography. And not just for the hilarious macho cover, in fact there are far worse examples elsewhere.\n\nIt\u2019s a fairly straightforward task to divide the album into the tracks that are more traditionally \u2018metal\u2019 and those that aren\u2019t, with the first, second, sixth, seventh, eighth and tenth being the former, and the others being... well, the best term would indeed be \u2018something else.\u2019 \u2018Heart of Steel\u2019 is led by piano, and gives Eric Adams a chance to show off his vocal cords in a more refined setting, before crushing drums return to a more familiar heavy territory. \u2018The Crown and the Ring\u2019 does something similar, only with a male choir replacing the need for heaviness and Adams reaching the high notes in a very minimal soundscape, with some more rousing lyrics as his character rides between battles. \u2018Sting of the Bumblebee\u2019 is the trademark Joey DeMaio bass guitar interpretation on a classical theme, this time Rimsky Korsakov\u2019s speedy piano ditty, and as usual is several borderline-unendurable minutes of a cocky musician showing off, scoring over earlier efforts simply for the inclusion of drums towards the end. The final oddball is the enigmatic \u2018The Warrior\u2019s Prayer,\u2019 which I still can\u2019t determine is serious or just an in-joke. I would love it to be the latter, I\u2019d have an enormous amount of respect for Manowar if all of this over-the-top performance has all just been a big laugh, but sadly I have heard all of their albums, and watched some interviews, and the reality is that they\u2019re just pretty dumb. Here we have an overlong narrative between a bombastic grandfather and an annoying child, telling a tale of four ultimate warriors wielding weapons that doesn\u2019t even bother veiling itself as an obvious allegory for Manowar, leading into the self-aggrandising finale.\n\nThe majority of the album follows the style that has continued since the band\u2019s debut album, but increased volume of guitars and screams doesn\u2019t live up to the simplistic enjoyment and energy of the first four classic albums. \u2018Wheels of Fire\u2019 opens with motorbike sound effects, the third time a Manowar album has done this, and although the increased volume of the chorus allows for the clear production of the guitars and double bass drums to be admired, it does tend to be a little too overpowering. The title track is better, a little unoriginal in its medium speed but delightfully pompous in its lyrics, as Eric Adams sings about how amazing Manowar are for playing loud and \u2018wearing jeans and leather, not crackerjack clothes,\u2019 for about the fifth time. \u2018Kingdom Come\u2019 is the closest thing to filler on this diverse album, a solid metal song that plods along enjoyably but a little uninterestingly until the incredible screamathon over the relentless guitar solo at the conclusion, but is probably the song least likely to be remembered afterwards.\n\n\u2018Pleasure Slave,\u2019 on the other hand, is instantly shockingly memorable for the band\u2019s unadulterated honesty about the use of women. It could be argued that the lyrics are written from the voice of a character rather than the band themselves, but as they identify so much with the brave warriors elsewhere, and since, as I said, I\u2019ve seen interviews and music videos, there\u2019s no irony to be found here. Depending on the listener, it will provoke a strong reaction towards laughter, offence or possibly a sincere nod of agreement. I know which group I belong to. The final song, \u2018Blood of the Kings,\u2019 seems to pick up where \u2018Wheels of Fire\u2019 left off, and is similarly loud and furious, but as with the finale to the previous few albums, doesn\u2019t really know when to call it quits with guitars and drums winding down for a couple of minutes just when you thought everything was over.\n\n\u2018Kings of Metal\u2019 has a clear target audience, and Manowar is very strict on the issue of compromise. \u2018We don\u2019t attract wimps cause we\u2019re too loud, just true metal people that\u2019s Manowar\u2019s crowd,\u2019 they proclaim. While their definition of true metal is a little debatable (half of this album consisting of classically influenced piano, choral and bass songs, with one really stupid spoken word piece), this would nevertheless most likely suit the tastes of someone whose appetite has already been whetted by the more accessible likes of Iron Maiden, Judas Priest or Metallica. Then again, anyone who braves the album cover and the track titles should know what they\u2019re getting into, and any offence they find in suggestions that women should remove their garments, kneel before men, and be chained unto the bed is completely their own fault. This borders on being a classic metal album, and was doubtless as influential as its predecessors towards the evolution of fantasy metal genres in the past decade, but far from Manowar\u2019s finest forty seven minutes.\n",
        "\nThe eighties were an incredible and stupid time, though my own memories are admittedly vague and mainly concern Postman Pat and fish paste sandwiches. Heavy metal bands wearing codpieces and singing about historical battles were unusually motivated in their craft, and most managed to consistently release a brand new studio album every single year while also managing to fit in a painstaking world tour to promote the last one. In 1984, Manowar served up two doses of overkill in the form of \u2018Hail to England\u2019 and its less well-known successor, \u2018Sign of the Hammer.\u2019 While the New Yorkers were obviously heavily driven that year to spread their message of the glory of Vikings and heavy metal, two releases in such a short space of time arouse fears that these records will favour quantity over quality. But could you really get enough Manowar? The answer is clearly no. Shut up.\n\nManowar is often quite rightly seen as the silliest band of the lot, but these earlier albums are right up there with the best of eighties metal, filled with classic speed assaults and more relaxed and compelling offerings. The band\u2019s penchant for showing off costs their releases a little of their otherwise high quality, particularly noticeable in Joey DeMaio\u2019s trademark bass solo track for each album, but there aren\u2019t many bands that achieved a similarly high level of consistency in the same period. \u2018Sign of the Hammer\u2019 is significantly the end of a era for Manowar, before they switched to the major label Atlantic Records and their more polished and commercially viable tirades against \u2018false metal\u2019 sell-outs took on a decidedly hypocritical side. Coming in at the tail-end of an exhaustive period that saw the band\u2019s sound become increasingly epic and its subject matter more fantastical, this album is at once a satisfying culmination of all the disparate Manowar elements, summoned into a final desperate and somewhat knackered charge.\n\nIn terms of theme, Manowar\u2019s first album featured songs about (in order) bikes, heavy metal, juvenile independence, Vietnam, the glory of Manowar and the glory of battle. Afterwards, the laughable focus on heavy metal and the band itself remained a staple, but the contemporary political angle was increasingly replaced with more epic songs about Conan the Barbarian-style fantasy battles and the violent side of Viking mythology. \u2018Sign of the Hammer\u2019 returns to the more mixed focus of the first album, with the classic final song referring specifically to the 1978 mass suicide of the Jonestown cult, balanced out by an opening song about the band itself that can\u2019t help but be reminiscent of Spinal Tap and the by-now customary Viking song \u2018Thor (The Powerhead),\u2019 which is fittingly apt for the band\u2019s last great album in dealing with the prophesied end of Viking civilisation when the gods will fight the giants.\n\nThe production quality of this album is unfortunately a little inferior to its predecessors, perhaps revealing a rushed nature to this second recording of the year, and it doesn\u2019t help that attention is drawn that way in the opening \u2018All Men Play on 10,\u2019 as Eric Adams condemns his contemporaries in other bands that settle for \u2018a sound that\u2019s real thin.\u2019 All Manowar albums thus far have begun with a fast and upbeat metal anthem such as this, and although it\u2019s undeniably cool in the 80s metal fashion, it doesn\u2019t really stand out against the competition, but the main guitar riff is distinctive and memorable. Its successor \u2018Animals\u2019 is an unfortunate piece of very early filler that manages to be fast and full of energy, but isn\u2019t really about anything significant, and sounds more like KISS than anything. At only three and a half minutes it\u2019s not long enough to become tedious or a problem, but the album really needed a stand-out track at this early point to win the listener over, and sadly this isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s a shame, as the mediocre song, which isn\u2019t helped by its arbitrary thematic title, is the precursor to a very solid half-hour of Manowar at its finest, interrupted only by DeMaio\u2019s inevitable bass session at the penultimate track.\n\nThe afore-mentioned \u2018Thor (The Powerhead)\u2019 starts things off brilliantly, a five minute mini-epic that remains exciting throughout. Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d excels at guitar, from the opening riffs to the long and very cool solo, backed up by Scott Columbus with some of his best drum work and the always reliable bass clunk of DeMaio. As they achieved with the astounding \u2018Blood of My Enemies\u2019 on the previous album, the band manages to evoke the ancient Viking landscape with all the atmosphere of a film score, but without having to rely on external gimmicks such as a keyboard or the orchestration that pervades their more recent work. In this respect, there\u2019s a clear link between songs like \u2018Thor,\u2019 \u2018Blood of My Enemies\u2019 and the title track, discussed later, and the later \u2018Viking metal\u2019 genre pioneered by Bathory and other Scandinavian black metal artists. It may seem ludicrous to newcomers on first listen, but Manowar\u2019s music has had far-reaching implications across the board, explaining why so many black, death, symphonic and power metal bands have covered their work.\n\nDespite the foreboding generality of a title similar to that of \u2018Animals,\u2019 \u2018Mountains\u2019 proves to be the far more impressive of the two, and is executed at a far slower pace. DeMaio\u2019s bass provides the rhythm while Ross \u201cThe Boss\u201d is free to exude some atmospheric minimalism with his down-tuned guitar, never striving for the soaring melodies of other bands, only becoming prominent and heavy in the slow choruses. Eric Adams\u2019 triumphal vocals are punctuated by drumming in a sequence that\u2019s a little over the top, but should just be enjoyed for the optimistic \u2018feel-good\u2019 anthem that it is. Unfortunately, this is the one song on the album that outstays its welcome, somehow lasting past seven minutes without much variation, aside from a pleasant atmospheric section led by the bass in the middle. A cacophonous riff breaks the silence at the end as \u2018Sign of the Hammer\u2019 begins, another great battle anthem that seems thematically linked to \u2018Thor,\u2019 but only as much as any of Manowar\u2019s battle songs are related to each other. The pace is relentless and exhausting, not up to the impossible heights later set by death metal but beating all of the band\u2019s contemporaries, and Adams screams along very satisfyingly above the pounding instruments in the chorus. It\u2019s a shame, really, that a couple of minutes weren\u2019t transferred from \u2018Mountains\u2019 to this one, but that probably would have ruined things.\n\n\u2018The Oath\u2019 suffers a little from its position so late in the album as it doesn\u2019t offer anything that hasn\u2019t been heard a little better elsewhere, but it\u2019s essential listening for Eric Adams going even more out of control than he did on the previous song, and for approaching the thrash metal of the band\u2019s earlier \u2018Kill With Power.\u2019 The main riff is memorable, and if this had opened the album it would be a Manowar classic, rather than the second rate song it\u2019s relegated to at track six. Afterwards, it\u2019s bass solo time again with the standable \u2018Thunderpick,\u2019 a little longer than DeMaio usually puts us through but apparently a rhythm of his own devising this time, rather than a butchering of a classical piano melody. The one advantage of this song, which is at the same time a little irritating, is that its conclusion really does lead perfectly into \u2018Guyana (Cult of the Damned),\u2019 making that final song sound a little incomplete without it. \u2018Guyana\u2019 is similar to \u2018Mountains\u2019 in its reflective and atmospheric sound, but this time builds brilliantly over the first minutes with Adams\u2019 sinister thanks echoing over a marching drum-beat leading to the inevitable moment of mass suicide and the song\u2019s bitter finale. It\u2019s not a subject matter Manowar are more remembered for, and seems very tucked away at the end of this comparatively obscure album, but it\u2019s among their better songs from the period.\n\nOverall, \u2018Sign of the Hammer\u2019 tries to be something of a reworking of the first album aided by several years\u2019 worth of valuable experience, but it falls a little flat. The debut album worked so well for beginning with very traditional Mot\u00f6rhead/Judas Priest hard rock and moving towards the grander and more original epic style towards the end, the style that would dominate the next two albums and the majority of this release. \u2018Sign of the Hammer\u2019 struggles to recapture that innocent simplicity in the first two songs, but the band no longer seem confident in the stripped down approach. It\u2019s just as well, because epic territory is where they always excelled the best, and \u2018Thor (The Powerhead),\u2019 \u2018Sign of the Hammer,\u2019 \u2018The Oath\u2019 and \u2018Guyana (Cult of the Damned)\u2019 stand proudly alongside songs from the earlier albums such as \u2018Dark Avenger,\u2019 \u2018Battle Hymn,\u2019 \u2018Blood of My Enemies,\u2019 \u2018Army of the Immortals\u2019 and the entire \u2018Into Glory Ride\u2019 album (bet you can\u2019t wait for that review) as the band\u2019s finest work.\n\nThe question remains whether more patience that year would have resulted in a single, highly consistent album in the vein of \u2018Into Glory Ride,\u2019 rather than this mostly good album and the fairly mediocre \u2018Hail to England.\u2019 It\u2019s probable that some of the more throwaway songs on both would have been discarded in favour of putting more work into the better ones, but that would mean essentially losing all the enjoyable rubbish and not gaining very much for songs like \u2018Thor\u2019 which the band couldn\u2019t conceivably improve. It\u2019s probably for the best that \u2018Hail to England\u2019 was rushed out when it was so that work could begin on its more worthwhile predecessor, it\u2019s probably just a case of the band being too impatient to wait around perfecting things when they\u2019re all ready to go. Either way, Manowar wouldn\u2019t release another album for a comparatively astonishing three years, after which things would never be quite so good again...\n",
        "\nThe flack that this album seems to have generated galls me. I would ask why but I don't need to because a great many people have written why on this very site. Luckily a great many people are dead wrong. This album is a masterpiece of epic proportions. A truely magical and enthrawling journey through one of the greatest stories ever told. The story of Odin is so great, so important to the metal world that a concept album about it could only be carried out by the greatest of metal bands. I think it's fair to say that if any band is deserving of that title it is Manowar.\n\nOne of the main problems people have with this album seems to be the spoken word parts. I ask whats wrong with them? As I see it they are integral parts of the album. The album is telling a story, personally I think they are just as entertaining as some of the songs (and that is not a dig at the songs) and without them the album would become quite pointless. Too many of them? SKIP THEM IDIOT! Chances are your CD/MP2 player has a \"Next track\" feature, use it! As to the argument that one shouldn't be required to skip tracks in order to enjoy an album, well that's your own damn fault isn't it. Any normal and sane person would relish the chance to hear something a little different, especially when done so well and by such a great band.\n\nWhats another false accusation thrown at this album? Oh yes, that the metal songs are somewhat weak. Do us all a favour and SHUT UP! Sleipnir is a mighty track. Logan's guitar is simply superb, the lyrics are brilliant and the chorus although oft repeated is a singalong classic. Sons of Odin does have a slightly simple guitar line, so fucking what? It still sounds great, it still sounds mighty, it still sounds fucking epic. King of Kings I won't go near because It's had good reviews all round and Loki God of Fire isn't the best song Manowar ever cut but it's not too bad. Gods of War. Where do I fucking start? This song is what Manowar are all about. If you were marching into battle this is the song you would want to be marching to. The best word I have heard to describe it is simply \"Relentless\".\n\nWhat about the less heavy songs? Blood Brothers? Yeah ok so it's quite possibly the cheesiest song Manowar ever did but I still quite like it, if nothing else the lyrics are lovely, cheesy but still quite lovely. Odin? Quite simply superb. Starts off as an average song with nice guitars but when the Army of the Dead refrain hits you know that this song is something special, something wonderous, dare I say it something epic. Hymn of the Immortal Warriors? If someone said that I could only ever listen to one song from this album I would choose this one. It is the perfect progressive metal song, starting with quiet subdued guitars and whispered vocals but gradually building up to an epic and thouroughly empowering singalong finale.\n\nFinally I will adress the ludicrous argument that this album isn't metal. It is, plain and simply one of the most metal albums I have ever owned. Ok so it's not as heavy as other albums but that means jack when it comes to metal. Master of the Wind isn't heavy but it's more metal than most of the tat that passes nowadays. Metal is a theme, a feeling, a state of mind if you will, it has nothing to do with heavy guitars and pounding drums. They serve only to enhance the message that metal brings. Are you honestly suggesting that the lyrics \"Raise thy weapons on this night, ye shall not die alone\" aren't metal. If that's what you think then you shouldn't be listening to Manowar, heck you shouldn't be listening to metal period.\n",
        "\nI'm a huge Manowar fan. I love all of their albums. I know how a lot of people feel about Manowar, so this review takes those people into consideration.\n\nPeople who don't like Manowar can like this album. It's not nearly as \"cheesy\" as the later works, including lyrics. It's still got the Manowar sound that all Manowar fans love, but it's different in some way. There's a really \"young\" sound to it, which isn't surprising since this is their debut. It's more straight forward, and less over the top.\n\nThe vocals from Eric Adams are top notch, as always. Probably one of the high points of this album. He puts attitude in his vocals, and he's got a really powerful voice. He can hit the low and high notes. His vocals give Manowar part of their distinctive sound, and I think he's great on this album. Very accessible vocals, easy to sing along to, and very FUN to sing along to.\n\nJoey DeMaio, the bassist, and main songwriter, shows on this album. He uses an 8 string bass on some songs (like Battle Hymn), and plays it like a regular guitar, with a pick. He's got some great basslines on here, like on Fast Taker and his solo, William's Tale. He mainly follows the rhythm guitar, but he has some leads and sometimes he stops playing pedal riffs. He adds some of the \"power\" to Manowar, since his 8 string bass is tuned as a bass with a second string set tuned one octave higher (so it's EeAaDdGg). I've been told the intro to \"Battle Hymn\" is this bass alone, but I'm not sure on this.\n\nThe guitar work is catchy, and the riffs are epic sounding and very memorable. The leads are even more memorable, and I find myself singing along to them every time I listen to this album. None of the guitar work is very technical, and the guitar sounds like it's layered once, so there are two rhythm guitars, and one rhythm guitar during leads. Joey provides rhythm during the leads at some times.\n\nThe drumming isn't remarkable. It's just average 1980s heavy metal drumming. Just there to add some power to the music and to keep time. Not much to say here.\n\nManowar has had an awesome career, and this is the start of it. I started with this album, and I'd advise new fans to do the same. If you're into Motorhead, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, or any heavy metal or power metal from the 80s, you'll like this album. I don't see why a lot of people hate Manowar, but it's their loss I say.\n\nMy favorite tracks are Death Tone, Metal Daze, Fast Taker and Battle Hymn.\n",
        "\nHere's a perfect summary of my feelings on this album: you go for a meal, expecting some vast 4-course banquet to leave you stuffed for a week. What arrives is barely half a small plateful spread out over a single large plate, and one that has no flavour or taste at all. Afterwards you feel empty as ever, as if somehow everything was just left out. You wonder \"Was that the right meal?\" and equally with Manowar's \"Gods of War\" you have to wonder \"Was that the right album, or did I just get given someone's early demo work, half-finished?\" And bear in mind, I am a generous reviewer, I tend to look at the positive in my reviews, I am not one to slag things off lightly. Truly, this is far, far worse than the much-loathed St. Anger or other such attempts considering poor by the masses (which I often disagree with).\n\nThe vocals are powerful, and while the lyrics are cheesy this is Manowar, what do you expect? No, they can't be blamed for that much. Also, the concept behind it is a good one, and is actually carried out quite well most of the time, fair kudos for that. What makes this album quite a damp squib is the simple lack of musical power. The thing that really drags it down is not only are there too many plain speaking parts, but even the \"full-on\" parts still feel devoid and empty. Often it just sounds like a really basic drum beat and a single riff being played over and over while the singing goes on. Seriously, go listen to Van Canto's a'cappelo album debut, with just voices and drums, an excellent piece. It honestly sounds fuller and more complete than this, their voices contain more power and impact than the guitars here.\n\nIt feels so very empty, similar to Annihilator's recent offering \"Metal\", but unlike \"Metal\" it seems less due to the mix or production, more simply because the songs just aren't very good. They're plain and simple. The solos are very short and not very powerful. The drums are boring and repetitive. The guitar work is drab and lifeless, doing little more than setting a pace behind the vocals. And while the vocals are good, half of that is only due to the electronic effect used on it (have a listen to the closing seconds of Sleipnir to see exactly what I mean there). It just feels too much like there's no substance, a theme that runs through the album as a whole due to the number of filler tracks, and the individual songs too, they honestly sound rather pathetic at times, and it's sad that such an established act should fall to this.\n\nAs has been pointed out in other reviews, there are actually just 47 minutes of metal to it, the rest is filler. Now, this could actually be forgiven for the most part. 25+ minutes of filler is simply too much, it's more than a third of the thing, but I wouldn't mind much IF there was a pay off. But even those 47 minutes of metal are bad metal, some of the most simplistic and uninspired I've heard in a long time. The narration is good, and some of it would be perfectly fine, if only every track were more like King of Kings and they maybe cut half the padding out. 15 minutes worth in an hour long album, with a good solid 7-10 Manowar songs would be a perfectly respectable album. As it is, it fails badly.\n\nEven as a debut demo from a starting band this would be poor. From someone like Manowar it's frankly embarassing. Every aspect sounds like Manowar came up with a quarter of what they should have done and said \"Well, we can pad it out, they'll never notice\". Each song feels like half of song in every way. It sounds like there aren't enough riffs, the solos sound way too short, each song sounds like it has half as many vocals as it should, they end so quickly...the list goes on. There's simply not enough substance to make a full album here, this amounts to maybe an EP of work, no more. It frankly sounds like it was put together by complete newcomers who have no idea what they're doing, and think that a single riff, a dozen lines and some beginner level drumming makes a full song. No, it's doesn't. It doesn't make a full song at all, and this is supposed to be \"Epic metal\". Nothing whatsoever is epic here, I can promise you.\n\nA few specifics:\n\nLoki God of Fire is truly terrible. It's only 3:49 long, and for the last THIRD of the song it just repeats the same damn thing over and over again. It gets very boring, and feels like a single section of a song stretched out.\n\nThe Overture tracks, the songs done with a grand organ and orchestral sound, are actually the most complete sounding track here! It sounds properly done and fleshed out...if only the rest did.\n\nSons of Odin: Half the track is mindless plucking with talking. The other half is literally just a basic riff repeating over and over with quiet drums you can easily miss. It honestly sounds like one long build-up which should be a total of one minute, before the main song starts. Instead it's the whole track, and dragged out over 6 and a half minutes. You get to the big \"explosive\" (and I use this term only comparatively) ending and think \"That's it?\"\n\nThere are one or two nice bits to note about the album though:\n\nKing of Kings is pretty decent actually. It shows some of what will drag the rest of the album down, at times feeling too simple, but for the most part it fits better with old-style Manowar, and the lyrics are very good, they flow well and match the instruments, and the drums actually have some power to them here.\n\nThe \"bonus track\", Die For Metal, is actually pretty good too. The lyrics are kinda cheesy, but actually less so than Annihilator's \"Army of One\" (another suitable comparison point to be drawn), because this track achieves what it sets out to do. Yes, it's simple, but unlike the rest of the album it feels right, feels like it should be simple and catchy. The rest of the album feels like it's trying to be big and bold and epic, and failing. Same with Annihilator's \"Army of One\", which felt like it was trying to be more than it could. Die For Metal is actually pretty inspiring most of the time, and the basic riffing works well to emphasise the solid lyrics, delivered with genuine power and feeling. It's perhaps a bit of a sad fact that the best track on the album is the \"bonus\" track, set apart from the rest.\n\nWhat's annoying is that one of the things it gets criticised for, the number of spoken build-up tracks, could actually have paid off well. Those filler pieces could have been really nice builds to big, vast, epic numbers. As it is, they only highlight how empty the \"non-filler\" tracks are, because there's little difference other than basic guitar and drum work going on behind the voice. KISS's \"God of Thunder\" produces a far better effect than this does, and that should tell you something on it's own.\n\nI have heard people defend it, saying that spoken parts and so on enhance this whole. This is sometimes true, but nearly half the album? That's simply too much. Emperorjvl gets this album spot on: spoken/orchestral bits have been used before and to great effect, but only when they enhance the song and album as a whole. Here they just feel like they're used to pad out the album because there simply isn't a full album of material here, and thus while these parts can make the whole better, they can also make the whole much worse when it doesn't work. And then the rest of the material just sounds uninspired and dull.\n\nSo I'll give it about 30%. This is because, of the 16 tracks, only about two or three are really worthwhile, with the odd scattered bit in elsewhere, probably coming to about a 20% score total, and then a bit extra because the concept itself is nice and a few narration/filler bits are okay really. Without King of Kings and Die For Metal this would get about 10% or so tops.\n",
        "\nPersonally, I can't understand why so many people hate this album and complain that there's not enough 'true metal songs' on it. Imagine that Manowar had realesed typical metal album instead of 'Gods of War' - with standard heavy metal songs, two or three ballads etc. I bet that there would have been complaints that they are doing the same over and over again. The conclusion is: you can't please everyone and, secondly, people enjoy complaining.\n\n\nNow I think I should write something about the album itself. 'Gods of War' is a concept album based on Norse mythology. It focuses on Odin - nordic god of war (surprise, surprise). To build proper atmosphere Manowar included spoken introductions, overtures and other similar things. They occupy a large part of the album and are a main cause of complaints. However, I think they are necessary to link the other songs together and keep the story in one piece. Some of them are also quite interesting. To be honest, I can't imagine listening to the title track without might introduction 'Glory Majesty Unity' - it just wouldn't be the same.\n\n\nAnd now a word or two about more traditional tracks. They are all excellent. 'King of Kings', 'Sleipnir' and 'Loki God of Fire' are fast and powerful heavy metal songs with mighty sing-along choruses. There are also slower but massive songs, which crush everything around - especially worth mentioning is the title track. And, last but not least, there is a ballad - 'Blood Brothers'. It's a traditional Manowar ballad, maybe not as powerful as 'Swords in the Wind' but still very enjoyable. Ah, there is also 'bonus track' - an if-you-don't-like-metal-we-will-kill-you song called 'Die for Metal', which includes some funny lyrics ('...and the guy beside me gave me a beer').\n\n\nHere I should write how great the album is and recommend it to everyone, right? Wrong. I mean, it is great but I think it's just not for everyone. If you want fast and simple metal album to bang your head to, stay away from this one. If you consider Blind Guardian's 'Nightfall in Middle Earth' boring and full of useless interludes then 'Gods of War' will kill you. Literally. But if you are an open-minded person who enjoys epic stories, you should give it a chance and you won't regret it. \n\n\nConcerning rating: I've planned to rate it a bit lower, but I really can't find any serious flaws (here most of you would probably think about these spoken tracks, but I think it would be stupid to replace them with some mediocre metal songs).\n",
        "\nCongratulations, Manowar, you made the most pointless, stupidest album of all time. It's impossible for me to think of anyone even listening to the whole album...\n\nThis is complete shit. Actually, after this torture, I'll never speak \"shit\" again. I'll just say \"Sons of Odin\" and make more impact. Man, this album is fucking horrible! It's disgusting that a once classic heavy metal band, that used to represent all that Metal is, has now officialy hit the bottom of the bigest well mankind has never done. The attempt on being epic here is so pathetic that after 20 secs is not even funny, because that's when you realize that the only heavy metal feeling you'll get will be at the end of the album, when you want to bang your head against the wall and forget the last painfull hour.\n\nThis is BORING. BORING AS HELL could never be. Therion, you are nothing compared to this. Give up. Manowar's \"Son of Odin\" made Therion looks like Accept. This is bad.\n\nThe first track (overture etc) is an intro. Do you know that kind of album intro that's so pointless that you always skip it to the next song? Well, this surely happens here, but unfortunenly it's not only in the intro. Actually, \"Overture to the Hymn of the Immortal Warriors\" (GREAT name by the way) is an introduction to \"The Ascension\", the introduction of \"King of Kings\". \n\nAnd \"King of Kings\", my friends, is a perfect exhibition of pure heavy power metal that Manowar used to do with pride and now seem too tired to try. King of Kings is probably a top 10 Manowar song, it's a really amazing song. Even the slow cheesy emotional part somewhere in the middle works, because it explodes in some fast and furious riffage and soloing and screaming and BALLS. Tell me why and how a band can write a song like this in such a horrifying album... I'd give them 20 points just because of that song, but the rest of it made me so angry that I just can't do it.\n\nI have nothing to say about the rest of the album, especially because I couldn't hear all of it. Maybe \"Loki God of Fire\" and \"Sleipnir\" worths some attencion, but it's nothing special either. At least there are guitars instead of ridiculous cheesy keyboards, speeches and AMAZING sound effects imittating fire, winds etc.\n\nAnd let me get something clear now. I love Manowar. Battle Hymns, Hail to England, Fighting the World, Kings of Metal etc. These are great examples of pure heavy metal with power and BALLS. Of course there was some pointless cheesy songs here and there, but everybody liked it 'cause the essency was there. And somewhere between 2001 (beeing nice to them) and 2007 they've lost it. I could close my eyes and believe that \"Sons of Odin\" was just a bad idea, but no. I'm really sorry to say it, but for me Manowar is officialy dead and buried and burnt and shooted in the middle of the legs. Twice. I guess Joe DeMaio thought that the reason we all used to love Manowar were the \"true\" epics speeches and the unnecessary songs as \"The Warriors Prayer\" instead of the pounding riffs and amazing songwriting.\n\nMake a favour for you and Metal- don't buy this. It's uninspired at all senses, pure utter shit. I'm sorry about the vocabulary, but this is probably the WORST attempt by a major metal band ever, along with Risk and St Anger. But at least Metallica and Megadeth admited what they were doing at the time, whilst Manowar will keep the TRU speeche and etc. Shame on you.\n",
        "\nAfter a couple of months of listening, I've finally decided to take the plunge and review Manowar's latest album, Gods of War. This review is very hard for me to write...I feel somewhat like the protaganist in that old frosties advert - the fanboy in me wants to praise this album to the skies and call it a triumph on every level, but the metalhead in me wants to be objective, and talk about an album with some great successes, and some serious flaws.\n\n\nAs most, if not all of you will now be aware, Gods of War is the first in a series of (hopefully much more focussed) albums retelling (with dubious accuracy) some of the good old fucking Norse myths. Now, I love the Norse myths, I mean, take some of Odin's trials for instance, one of his challenges was to lift a cat up off the floor. Simple enough, you might think, not so! For the cat was actually a vast serpent, which is wrapped around the entire world! Sounds like someone should have gone to specsavers, or just laid off the fucking mead. Getting back to the point, when Manowar announced the concept for this set of albums I was more than a little psyched, as to my mind Epic Metal + Norse Myths = Killer album, guaranteed.\n\n\nI was sadly mistaken.\n\n\nThe main gripe that I and pretty much everyone else has with this album is the LACK OF METAL SONGS! What are all these cheesy pseudo-ambient narrative interludes doing on this album??? Why can't Manowar just develop the story through kick ass songs instead of what can only be described as verbal wankery? For more than half of this album its like a frigging a cappella Dream Theater!\n\n\nThe thing is, when I listen to this album all the way through and I'm in the mood, it really works! I can forgive the narration and just enjoy the epic feel of the album and relish the fact that Manowar are still alive and well. In the right mood and at the right time, Gods of War is a flawed, but hugely enjoyable journey through some of the world's greatest myths and legends. But despite this, the fact remains that Gods of War is not the album that the Manowar fans wanted after a 5 year long drought in studio albums. Now, the real metal songs on here range from above average to total killers, and as has been mentioned before, the production is totally killer, no complaints at all in that department. And we find the band all on good form here, Adams does a better job here than on WOTW, with some excellent midrange singing and that undeniable scream. Joey...well he does his thing...he hasn't really been too adventurous with the old bass since 1991, and no ones expecting him to start adding original bass hooks now. Karl adds some riffs which range from more than adequate to really quite good, and some incredibly tight soloing. Scott disappoints on this album; the man is an excellent drummer, but on GoW he tends to stick to the same tired sounding double bass beat. Uninspired.\n\n\nIt also seems that Manowar have still not yet solved the problem of their tracklisting. It just doesn't flow very well...ok they start to build up some momentum but then destroy it by prolonging the listener's wait for some blasting metal. \"In Triumph\" by The Quill is a perfect example of an album with a well thought out tracklisting, mixing fast and slow songs to create a natural rhythm which, are you listening guys, STOPS THE LISTENER GETTING BORED.\n\n\nSo yeah, let's pick out the real songs and dissect, scalpels out children, ok first off is king of kings...the first song bizarrely appearing 9 minutes into the album. Well we'd already heard this one, as it was the advance single from the album, definitely a Manowar classic, all the ingredients present and correct, really love the solo on this one, tighter than a young girl in her prime. Next up is Sleipnir, which takes a while to get started due to the overlong and slightly irritating narrative passage, but when it gets cracking its an enjoyable one, though the chorus is repeated too many times. Also it sort of ends rather abruptly, but no worries, straight into Loki, god of...erm fire? Ok slight error there but nevermind. As most other reviewers have mentioned Loki has a more hard rock feel to it, with a great chorus, all in all an excellent track!\n\n\nNow...oh dear what is this...Blood Brothers? Isn't that already a more memorable and anthemic song by Maiden (who I don't even like, but that song still owns this poor effort)? Manowar have had some pretty fucking decent ballads in their time, but this one falls rather short. I've got to say, I do like Adams' delivery in this one, but you can tell they just followed the generic Manowar ballad formula (Quiet intro verse, chorus once, guitars and drums kick in for second verse, chorus again, bridge, chorus chorus chorus etc) and really did nothing else with the song. But alas no, this song never really gets going enough to achieve the anthemic quality they were going for. Couple more points - Adams' background screams are absolutely unnecessary in this one, and, Scott's little marching drum section is probably his highlight of the album. That's right folks, that was it.\n\n\nAfter another couple of boring interludes that I do not care to dissect comes possibly the strongest track on the album, the mighty Sons of Odin. The powerful lead riff fades into an atmospheric passage punctuated by Joey's bassline, which leads up to the anthemic chorus, but by far the best part of this song is the refrain with the choir, my god, total fucking ownage! Ok we've got some momentum going here, let's keep it going! Wait....no..its another fucking narrative passage again. Wow this is getting old. At long last we arrive at the title track, and things brighten up again, with a fucking great marching rhythm, some excellent vocals and brilliant orchestration. Total winner here. Another interlude follows, and then we have the song simply entitled \"Odin\", which has some interesting moments, but all in all is a little too slow and rather boring. Still, the reprise of Army of The Dead at the end is absolutely fantastic, really inspiring stuff.\n\n\nFinally we reach the end, of the concept at least, with the promisingly titled \"Hymn of the immortal warriors\", and yeah the song is great...but is another slow song really necessary? Where's the balance?\n\nNow, I really like Die For Metal, even though I'm aware that it is merely an average Manowar song, I'm not sure what it is, it might be the fact that it comes as light relief after an hour fraught with frustration and disappointment, maybe its just the balls to the wall who gives a fuck homoeroticism and metal worship which I'vebeen missing for the duration of this contrived, overly epic affair. Yes, the lead riff sounds like a Kashmir rip off, yes the lyrics are familiar and clich\u00e9d, yes it doesn't really go anywhere, but its Manowar doing what they do best, and I'm fucking glad they're still around to do it.\n\nNow the album is finished my feelings are mixed to say the least. On the one hand, GoW has some great songs which are going to be on my playlist for a long time to come, and proves that Manowar can still bring something to the table, but on the flip side, GoW is not the album I was expected, or even the album I wanted. I think all Manowar fans were hoping that they would improve on the successes WoTW had and try to iron out the weak points, but instead they seem to have done the opposite, with even more throwaway tracks and even less arse kickery! I just hope that Joey Demaio can have the good sense to listen to what the fans are saying and follow this up with an album of straight up heavy metal, or at least note the fans reaction to the new material played live, because you can bet your house that when they leave the stage, the fans aren't going to be screaming for an encore of \"blood brothers\".\n",
        "\nThe early albums of Manowar were the best ones in terms of quality, but that wasn't reflected on sales. Manowar was always in a \"almost famous\" state, a good heavy metal band indeed, but with few fans. So they adopted some Judas Priest and Kiss elements, bands that sold many records at that time (and they still do) The result was \"Fighting the World\", an album that represent the end of the 'old age' of Manowar, and the opening of a new one, a bridge between \"Sign of the Hammer\" and \"Kings of Metal\".\n\n\n\"Fighting the World\" kicks off the album. It's the perfect single, very catchy. It could be a perfect Kiss song, or a song of Judas Priest's \"British Steel\". The same happens with \"Blow Your Speakers\". Yes, \"FtW\" and \"BYS\" are good tracks, but they lack of that 'Manowar feeling' that made them great. \"Carry On\" is the first 'Manowar' song here. It's something like a ballad, those kinds of ballads that Manowar often does, like \"Heart of Steel\". It starts with acoustic guitars, and then it goes with a metallic rhythm. \"Violence and Bloodshed\" is a good heavy metal song, fast and enjoyable, but just average, especially for Manowar. \"Defender\" is an attempt of \"Dark Avanger\", even with Orson Welles' voice, but it's far from that outstanding track.\n\n\n\"Drums of Doom\" is an short interlude to \"Holy War\", the first track that can be considered as a 'Manowar' track, with no doubts. \"Master of Revenge\" is another interlude that opens the best song of this album: \"Black Wind, Fire and Steel\", a kickassing power metal song that's also a classic, too. Hearing this track worths the owning of the album, indeed.\n\n\n\n\"Fighting the World\" isn't the best Manowar album, and I dont' reccomend you to buy it if you don't like this band. But it's still a good heavy metal piece, although there's few Manowar elements on this record. The buying of this album it's up to you.\n",
        "\nAfter hearing this one, it's very clear that Manowar doesn't want to change anything of their classic and 'true' sound. They will keep playing loud and epic heavy metal, till the day of their death. And it's great to know that. Manowar is stuck in the sound of the \"Kings of Metal\" album, with heavy anthems against false metal and epic power ballads, which always remember to that beautiful song, \"Heart of Steel\". Yes, here's nothing new, the same old Manowar, but the band is so great that it doesn't matter, although Manowar is releasing albums just like an excuse to play new songs live... they still are the same kickass band.\n\nWhen I say that there's nothing new here, it's applied to the whole album, including the musicianship. DeMaio and Columbus, still fucking great. Karl Logan, the new guitar player, does it great, he's OK for Manowar. And if a guitar player is OK for Manowar, he's outstanding. Adams' voice, great. A perfect voice for heavy metal, a voice that stayed through the years as one of the classic voices of heavy metal music.\n\nThe songs are classic Manowar, again, nothing new, but still in a high level. \"Return of the Warlord\" is the first one, that makes reference to the first song of the \"Into Glory Ride\" album. This one is the classic metal anthem, about riding motorcycles and wearing leather. The rhythm is catchy, with nice guitar, bass and drum playing. \"Brothers of Metal\" is another of those metal anthems that Manowar often plays. It goes on mid-tempo, and it's good, but just that. \"The Gods Made Heavy Metal\" goes with the same formula, but this time faster and better. Great song, very catchy. Then we have \"Courage\", a beautiful power ballad, with a nice piano playing. We could call it a 'Manowar ballad', epic and heavy, with slow rhythm. \"Number One\" is another classic Manowar's heavy metal song, with their characteristic style, about winning competitions. \"Outlaw\" is a fucking great power metal piece, at full speed, with nice riffs and drum playing. With \"Outlaw\" starts the best part of the album. \"King\" is another great song, it starts slow with great piano playing, then with a faster and metal rhythm.\n\nManowar always puts a solo on their albums. \"Today is a Good Day to Die\" and \"My Spirit Lives On\" are the solos here. \"Today...\" is very long, slow and epic, with orchestration and stuff like that, and \"My Spirit...\" is fast and raw. Both of those solos are great shows of Logan's skill with the electric guitar. Finally, \"The Power\" is another fast power metal piece, like \"Outlaw\". A good song to finish the record.\n\nIf you want 'true' heavy/power metal, try to get Manowar albums. This would be nice to start, but \"Hail to England\" or \"Kings of Metal\" would be better for starting.\n",
        "\nThere's always something to say about Manowar. From their humble beginnings, they always preach their will to kill poser metal and the wimps who listen to it. For DeMaio, this is even more serious than his own life, and sometimes it's so exaggerated, that generates self-parodies. Anyway, Manowar is like AC/DC or Mot\u00f6rhead: nobody thinks that they could ever change a little of their epic 'true' metal, but in the 90's they lost some of the power of the early albums, making some records just to mantain their crowd of fans.\n\n\n\nAnyway, many people considers that \"Hail to England\" is the greatest Manowar album of all time. And it is... epic and 'true' metal is the formula here, with great and catchy choruses, and the instantly recognizable 'Manowar' element, the element that made Manowar unique: their musicianship. The vocals, the drums, the bass, the guitar, everything is Manowar's trademark, a formula thousands of times copied, sometimes good, but sometimes in a very bad way.\n\n\nEric Adams' vocals are the first 'Manowar' trademark. It's just impossible to imagine Manowar without Adams' shouting, as simple as that. DeMaio is the 'Boss' in Manowar, the one that keeps the band's spirit alive. He is a God of bass playing. \"Black Arrows\" is a prove of that. Ross The Boss' guitar playing is great. He is as good as the other Manowar guitar players after him, but the classic albums were recorded with Ross in guitars, so that is a huge point in favour to him. An we all know the force of Columbus' drums, he can play only with a 'metal' drumkit, because every normal drumkit cant stand Columbus' playing.\n\n\n\"Blood of my Enemies\" starts the album. It is the classic Manowar anthem, epic and heavy, with a catchy chorus. \"Each Dan I Die\" follows the same patterns, but it works fucking great. \"Kill With Power\" speeds up the rhythm, with a great riff and a astonishing chorus... 'KILL WITH POWER... DIE DIE!!'... one of the highlights of the album. \"Hail to England\" and \"Army of Immortals\" are in the same style of the first two tracks, more epic and mighty choruses... more of the same, but in the best sense of the word. \n\n\nNow, \"Black Arrows\" is the best solo I've ever heard in my entire life. An electric bass that sounds like a guitar, with tons of distortion... Joey DiMaio is a bass player. Everyone else, just wimps and posers. Just listen to this one, he didn't seems to be human. Finally, \"Bridge of Death\", another epic anthem of almost 9 minutes. It's the perfect summary of the true epic power of \"Hail to England\". \n\n\nIs \"Hail to England\" the best album of Manowar? Yes. But there's some great albums as well, like any of the 80's era, even \"Fighting the World\". Mandatory for every metalhead.\n",
        "\nI'm always hopeful when Manowar is going to release a new album. I wouldn't call them one of my favorite bands, but they just keep putting out way above average heavy metal albums with a few absolute killers (\"Call to Arms\" from their previous album, for example) regardless of current trends. Their single was overall enjoyable and when I heard that \"Gods of War\" was going to be a concept album about Norse mythology, I was very interested. It was obvious to me that these old metal warriors still had it and that the new album had the potential to be a real monster. But as my score suggests, Manowar has failed me. In fact, this just might be the biggest metal related disappointment I have ever experienced!\n\nLet's start with the good things about this album: the production leaves nothing to be desired. Without a doubt this is the most polished production they've ever had. It would ruin their older albums, but it fits this more epic direction perfectly. The sound is crystal clear, the guitars are heavy as usual, the drum sound is powerful and the orchestrations are very well done. To sum it up, the production is pretty much perfect. \nThe production allows Eric Adams to deliver one of his best vocal performances ever. It's mindboggling how a middle-aged man who have been screaming his vocal chords out for more than 25 years still can sound this good. His mid-range is powerful and convincing and he can still go impressively high. \nFinally, the real metal songs on here aren't that bad. Opener \"King of Kings\" has a driving beat and a classic Manowar-style sing-along chorus. \"Sleipnir\" is probably the best song on here, despite the fact that it start with one minute of narrations. It's quite similar to \"King of Kings\", but a little better in just about every way. Especially the chorus is awesome. \"Loki God of Fire\" is another good song with some of the best and heaviest riffs on the album. Loki was not the god of fire, but I'm not geeky enough to take off points for that. \n\nWhat about the bad things then? Well, there's one thing about this album that drags it down from a decent Manowar album to a disaster all by itself. Every other review of this album has mentioned it, but let's clear things up: This album has more fucking narrations and orchestral interludes than Rhapsody\u2019s entire discography!!! Not to mention that the narrator rivals Jay \"Oh no...Oh God no\" Landsford (Rhapsody's narrator on their first albums)in the cheesiness department. The almost 5 minute long narrative piece \"Glory Majesty Unity\" just might be the most embarrasing thing I have ever heard on a metal album. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this album contains more than 30 minutes of narrations and orchestral pieces with some choral singing thrown in here and there. Some of them are quite well done, but it's just faar too much!! The question \"What the hell were they thinking?\" popped up in my head severel times when I listened to this album. \n\nThis is made even worse by the track listing, which is EVEN worse than on \"Warriors of the World\"! The three best songs are placed in the beginning, and the last 50 minutes of the album ranges between decent and insufferable. During a few parts of the album, I was fighting a strong urge to simply hit the stop button. \n\nAnother thing that really struck me while listening to this album was the musicianship, or lack thereof. Sure, Manowar were never about showing off, but the guitar playing on this album sounds uninspired as all hell. \"King of Kings\", Sleipnir\" and \"Loki God of Fire\" are the only songs with memorable guitar work. \nThe drums are even worse. How on Earth could Scott Columbus accept this? the drum work on this album consists either of mid-paced double bassing or simple beats that I could probably pull off. The great drum sound just makes this fact even more obvious. Lame with a capital L. \n\nApart from the three good songs I mentioned before, the other songs are Manowar on autopilot with the \"Epic\" setting set to 11. Both \"Sons of Odin\" and the title track are decent songs marred by uninspired guitar playing and some unneccesary choirs and/or orchestral interludes. And let's not forget the absolutely dreadful \"Blood Brothers\". It's boring beyond words, it tries to be uplifting but ends up being rather depressing just because it's so damn bad. One of Manowar's worst songs ever. \n\nMy theory is that somewhere during the tour with Rhapsody, Manowar caught the same flu that made those italians release the too-epic-for-it's-own-good \"Triumph or Agony\". That flu is yet to be named, but the most obvious symptom is that the infected band suddenly feels a burning urge to write some really epic music, even if it make them lose all the inspiration and intensity that made them a good band in the first place. It didn't work for Rhapsody and it really doesn't work for Manowar! \n\nThe last song is a \"bonus track\" just because it doesn't fit in the concept of the album. It's one of those ridiculously over-the-top \"Hail metal!!\" songs Manowar are famous for, but it's definitely not one of the best, and after sitting through more than one hour of cheesiness and stupidity, you are hit in the face by a chunk of mozarella the size of Asgard! Then finally the album is over, and it feels like half a day has passed since you put it in your CD player. \n\nBy Odin, I can barely believe that I see the Manowar logo on the (ridiculous even by Manowar standards) cover art. Except for 2-3 songs this album is more or less total crap. I can totally see the guys from Wizard or Majesty trying really hard to keep their faces straight while listening to this album. I'm simply baffled! How the FUCK did the \"Kings of Metal\" release this???\n",
        "\nHail to England is Manowar's most glorious release, easily one of their finest, if not the best album they ever put out. Their newer releases suffer from the overload of worthless orchestrations and ballads, while as their earlier releases before this one, and even a few after this suffered from sounding a bit too -hard rock- like from time to time. This is really not the case with Hail to England. As some might say, this is when they got their shit together and put out something remarkable. This is Manowar actually playing some great epic heavy metal. Quite possibly their heaviest and most aggressive venture.\n\nAs always Eric Adams is brighter than the sun with his powerful performance and incredible vocals, but he really seems like he completely perfected his craft here. At the end of the album self-titled track \"Hail to England\", Adams unleashes a 20 some second wail that seems to carry on endlessly when you're submerged into it. Truly an incredible part on this album that stands out. On top of this, the lyrics come out so clearly, a lot of the songs stick to my mind after hearing them. Albeit Manowar was never one of the best in the lyrics department, but back during this time stuff like this wasn't already done millions of times, so its really not something to be too disgruntled about. Basically, expect some of Eric Adam's best vocals ever here with catchy lyrics to top it off.\n\nThe production is a bit odd at times, when you look at the bass. At times its almost like the bass is the riff driving machine here. Sound wise, it reminds me of Omen's \"Battle Cry\" quite a bit when you look at everything else aside from the bass. The production does give this album its odd atmosphere that makes it even better, though. Perhaps its just me though.\n\nSound and style wise, this is truly what Manowar has always sought to sound like. Epic and glorious heavy metal. There's no hints of hard rock or anything like that hear at all. And with amazing chorus's and catchy themes, this blows their more boring efforts out of the water (Sign of the Hammer and Louder than Hell come to mind). Its an upbeat, aggressive, consistent, and mature adventure. However, there is sadly an inevitable downfall to all of this. \"Black Arrows\". Yet again, we must cover our ears to spare them from one of the worst solo songs you could possibly imagine, and its a whopping three minutes long. Maybe these were cool to watch live when Manowar would destroy their equipment or something while mindlessly scratching notes, but their solo songs have always been some of the worst garbage I've ever heard. Thankfully, the last track \"Bridge of Death\" treates us to a nice yet odd experimental ending to a wonderful album.\n\nSadly, this album is just downright short. If you took out the solo song, you'd have a 30 minute album, which could qualify as a longer EP for some bands. Its a shame, but then again unlike most of their releases there just isn't anything bad on here or out of place, except for the solo song, so there's not a whole lot of room for complaining. Overall this is perhaps Manowar's most mature release, and a must own for anyone who calls themselves a fan of the band. Its a shame they didn't really go on to put out anything remotely like this afterwards. But, we can dream.\n",
        "\n2007. A crisis has taken the metal world by storm. The very foundation, the core, the soul of metal is at stake. Metal philosophy is at a crossroads, all questions unimportant when faced with the most fundamental of all: What is Truth?\n\nIn Metal existence, this Truth is synonymous with Metal, so the question must be asked: What is Metal?\n\nLeaving the ultimate resolution of the Great Question to higher planes, we take a practical approach: what defines Metal? what should Metal always have? \n\nSpeaker:Loud guitars? \nMetaldom:Aye! \nOver-the-top vocals? \nMetaldom:Aye!\nPounding drums? \nMetaldom:Aye! \nThat so undefinable quality, Heaviness?\nMetaldom:Hear,hear! (Loud clapping and cheering)\nLong orchestral and spoken word intros/outros/interludes?\n\n(Silence)\n\n\"Long orchestral and spoken word intros/outros/interludes?\" The Metal Gods fill their cups of Wrath, ready to pour them unto the heads of the unholy blasphemers. The Well of Infinite Metal Wisdom is consulted. Metaldom is astounded by the revelation of the identities of the perpetrators of such profanity.\n\nManowar.\n\nWe're not kidding here folks. Manowar has actually released an album of instrumental orchestration sounds/spoken word bullshit peppered with some metal here and there. Ok, to be fair,I've estimated the offending material at 44% of the total runtime. That's 32 nonmetal minutes in a 73 minute disc. That's not to say the symphonics stop when the guitars come in - they don't, but we have heard this before in songs like \"Achilles:Agony and Ecstasy\", the midsection of \"Outlaw\",\"Call to Arms\", and \"Dawn of Battle\", outstanding songs by modern Manowar. The symphonic/spoken word elements are nothing new (\"Grandfather, tell me a story\"), but previous compositions were successful because each element enhanced the whole, and the foundation and focus remained metal. In Gods of War, it seems Manowar forgot what it is they are supposed to BE while they were focusing on what they were trying to DO. The symphonic/spoken word elements so far dominate this album, while the metal material is so subpar, the result is like a car crash where all the people survived - as paraplegics. A bad, bad mistake was made when writing this album: assuming that more symphonics would make it \"epic\". For the life of me, I can't figure out what the thought process for this album was.\n\nI am baffled at hearing this album described as \"epic\", at least at the term being used in a positive connotation. \nfrom http://www.thefreedictionary.com/epic:\n\nepic:\n1. Of, constituting, having to do with, or suggestive of a literary epic\n2. Surpassing the usual or ordinary, particularly in scope or size\n3. Heroic and impressive in quality\n\nAside from lyrical content (the story, of course, was not created by Manowar by any means), there is nothing rightly \"epic\" about this album. This album is the sound of a band getting carried away by the incidental components of the music, like a baker making a half-inch-thick cake with an inch of frosting on top. True, Manowar have surpassed themselves in symphonic/spoken word wankery, but epic? \"Surpassing the ordinary\"? \"Impressive in quality\"? No.\n\nThe other huge problem with this album is that most of the material is UTTERLY uninteresting (and here we speak exclusively of the METAL material, the other stuff got old the first time around), the exception being the first metal song \"King of Kings\" (which we already heard in the Sons of Odin ep), and even this is marred by (I know, flogging a dead horse) a spoken word/symphonic passage. The next metal track is \"Sleipnir\", which starts with (I know, flogging a horse carcass) a minute long spoken word intro. The song itself is ok, with a nice double bass pace and a nice solo, but the song is SO subdued. I mean, my toaster has gotten more emotion out of me. \"Loki, God of Fire\" is lukewarm water, a subpar rock song with a metal injection. The solo is nicely played, but as soulless as a stone gargoyle. This song would have been ok (maybe) in 1984, but in 2007 this doesn't fly. \n\nNext, it's unbelievable that the same band that graced us with \"Heart of Steel\" delivers the sewage that is the attempt at a ballad \"Blood Brothers\". Horrid. And is it me or is Eric Adams sounding tired? The next song with guitars, two intros later ( I know, flogging horse bones), is \"Sons of Odin\". If you had told Joey DeMaio back in 1988 he'd be playing stuff as dumb as the first two minutes of this song he would have broken your head with his bass. The \"choir\" chorus at 3:43 is just funny, and the song ends with more than a minute of (I know, flogging horse dust), yes, spoken word/symphonics.\n\n\"Gods of War\" starts out pompously with pounding sounds and a completely unnecessary \"choir\" chorus, but gets better after half a minute. Here, the symphonics actually work, evocating the epic feeling Manowar sought with this album. Unfortunately, the \"choir\" being the main focus of the chorus brings the song level down. Why Eric Adams chose to be counterpoint to the choir instead of the other way around is beyond me, but it doesn't work. The song ends in the trademark Manowar feedback/screams/drums way, which is just RIDICULOUS. It's like Will Smith being chosen as Pope: what is it we're trying to do here again? \"Odin\" is a clunker. \"Hymn of the Immortal Warriors\" starts out with softly sung vocals and (I know, flogging horse fossils, but you know what? the symphonic/spoken word shit just got old, FAST) symphonics. Organ sounds, spoken words, choir, Manowar go all out. I have to respect the doomy feel of the song two minutes in, if they had retained that sound the song would have worked. Instead they slather cheese all over it less than a minute later with the choir and a solo that reminded me of a glam band. Another song that won't be appearing in your personal \"Best of Manowar\" list. Some might like the \"bonus\" track, \"Die for metal\", but to me it sounds like a Kiss cover with the exception of the lyrics. \n\nThis album is an abortion. Instead of epic, elevated, and godly we have pompous, pretentious and boring. For the good of metal, somebody cut Manowar's access to keyboards. \n\nI hereby proclaim the Kings... exiled.\n",
        "\nYes, Manowar are the Kings of Cheese (Rhapsody being a close second). Yes, Vikings are a much over-used theme in metal. And yes, one would not find it hard to ridicule this album to death. However, all of this aside, I still strongly believe that this album absolutely slays.\n\nIt's quite easy to nitpick with \"Gods of War\"- too many interludes, not enough metal, it's too long, etc. But c'mon, this is fucking MANOWAR we're talking about. It's their job, their duty to take metal to the next level and kick ass and poser-dispose every second of the way!\n\n\"Gods of war\" is thus far the best metal album of 2007. Manowar bring everything that's great about heavy metal to the table on this release, from grandiose choirs and over-the-top lyrics to epic songs that are so catchy they will be stuck in your head for centuries (the songs \"Sleipnir\" and \"King of Kings\" immediately come to mind).\n\nCompared to their other albums, it would not be a stretch to say that the band took a few chances with this release; obviously, Manowar are pretty conservative when it comes to their style and are never going to do anything drastically different, but it's clear that \"Gods of War\" is an attempt to push metal to new heights of epic-ness (and cheese).\n\nThis is definately an album that is perfect for doing something. What I mean by this is that it's probably not the best album to just simply sit and listen to; it's a much better experience to work out to, or drive around to, or drink beer with your buddies to.\n\nLike I said before, this album kicks ass, and as I've noticed that this album has been received with some negativity, I think it's clear that they just can't handle the sheer heaviness that this album exudes. With this album, Manowar prove that they are still the Kings of Metal, so go out and give this release a spin, and prepare to be crushed by \"Gods of War.\"\n",
        "\nA new Manowar album finally! Five years after \"Warrior of the World\" the Kings\nof Metal return for the most epic effort.\n\n\"Gods Of War\", dedicated to Odin, has lots of orquestral and spoken tracks that\nhelp to build all the epic atmosphere in this album. The \"real\" songs are great\nand some are among the best ever written by Manowar. Expect great battle themed lyrics.\n\nI already knew \"King of Kings\", \"Sons of Odin\" and \"Gods of War\" from previous\nreleases. Here, these tracks sound better. \"King of Kings\" is a typical fast song featuring the Manowar riffing we all know and a excellent way to start the album.\n\"Sons of Odin\" and \"Gods of War\" are heavy mid-paced tracks that blow me away everytime I listen. This last one is my favourite of the album. Fucking amazing and glourious track! Great lyrics, great solo, great feeling! \n\nWe have two songs with more rocking feeling such as \"Loki God of Fire\" which has a very catchy riff in the chorus and \"Die for Metal\" that'll make the listener think of Led Zeppelin's Kashmir, but still a good metal hymn nonetheless.\n\nThere are a couple of skip button worthy tracks here tough - Army of the Dead Part 1 and 2. The lyrics are good but the music is very boring.\n\nI have to say that I felt a bit disappointed when I heard this album for the first time\nbecause of the numerous orquestral and spoken parts but, after so many listens, I got used to them. I still think this album could have more heavy metal and speed. Let's just hope the next has more \"rockers\".\n\nOdin's proud.\n",
        "\nI love when bands take the epic direction and throw orchestral bits and concept albums into the mix. \"Gods of War\" is the first in a series of albums that will tell the tale of the Gods of War. This album focuses on Odin. This wouldn't be a good introduction to Manowar, so start with the other stuff first if you were thinking of introducing yourself to Manowar with this album. Thats a job for the first four, Louder Than Hell, or Kings of Metal.\n\nIf you dislike the orchestral aspects and/or spoken sections of bands such as Luca Turilli, Rhapsody, Symphony-X, and Nightwish among many others you most likely won't be a fan of this. Being a big fan of orchestra stuff, this is, overall, one of my favorite Manowar albums. The first three songs are EPIC. I like the way it flows a lot, sounds like a film score. Triumphant yet foreboding. A nice way to kick off the album. The spoken bits are kinda taxing, but once Eric Adams starts singing all is well. He sounds better than ever.\n\nThere are three songs on this album that have been rerecorded. King Of Kings, for example. It sounds better on the album; the solo has better reverb and is more crisp. The chorus is one of many. Another song rerecorded for this album was Sons of Odin. That one sounds far more epic; the outro chorus has a choir thrown over Eric Adams and it sounds incredible. The other was the title track.\n\nThe Army of the Dead songs remind me of \"The Divine Wings of Tragedy\" by Symphony-X, what with Eric Adams singing with a bunch of other vocalists. The ending falsetto is fucking epic in all three. Both part 1 and 2 of these songs feature the same bit as in the outro to Odin. Not to take away from the orchestral tracks of the album, I love most of them. I could do with a lot less spoken narration, but regardless the album listened to in full is quite the treat. Most of the orchestral writings make me feel nostalgic for Manowar; it reminds me of their past efforts.\n\nThats not to say the album is void of heavy stuff. The aforementioned rerecorded tracks, Loki God Of Fire, and Sleipnir are nice rockin' songs. The chorus in Sleipnir has some of the best melodic hooks Manowar has ever written, they'll get stuck in your head for days.\n\n\"Carry we, who die in battle\nOver land and sea\nAcross the rainbow bridge to Valhalla\nOdins waiting for me!\"\n\nThis album flows very well from one song to the next, telling an epic tale you can't not listen to in full. This isn't an album meant to be listened to in pieces, it's definitely a more enjoyable experience if you set aside an hour to listen to it in full followed by 20 minutes or so to reflect on its greatness.\n",
        "\nAt last Manowar have released a new album. A long time has passed since Warriors of the World, and even though some of the songs on there are silly and pretentious, the album includes some of the band\u2019s strongest material as well. I like Warriors of the World, and I like Manowar. Therefore I had very high expectations when I noticed that a new album was on its way. Those were raised even higher when I realized that it was a concept album about the Norse Gods. (I got that sort of feeling you receive from listening to Falkenbach, which inspires you to sit and bawl alone in a dark room because everything is so wonderfully, pathetically epic.) \n\nYes, I am a sucker for epic stuff. I know that it often gets over the top, but I can\u2019t help liking it anyway. This time however, Manowar have succeeded in being too epic, even for me, and that is pretty astounding. I think the problem is that being epic must be the icing on the cake; you cannot take away the actual cake. This is what Manowar have done. Only a few of the tracks on this album are real songs. It is crammed with symphonic intros, symphonic interludes, overlong spoken parts and soft music.\n\nKing of Kings is a metal song at least, and it is also one of the best. Then there are a couple of songs which are decent but a little too soft, for example Sleipnir and the ballad Blood Brothers. As a whole I think that the guitars suffer from a lack of distortion, as well as, how shall I put it \u2026 a lack of existence. By that I mean that they have lost their dominance on many tracks, and merely function as background to the vocals and drums. That is a pity, because Manowar\u2019s greatness has always relied upon the cool riffs and solos. On this album, they have forgotten that the metal must be the basis, upon which the epic elements can be built, and without it, the music loses much of its quality.\n\nOf course there are a couple of metal songs on here, but many of them are either much less heavy and speedy than Manowar\u2019s usual material or contains long slow parts with sound effects and a narrator. And let me remind you, I like such things normally! \n\nI would say that this album can be separated in three equally large parts: one with symphonies, and other non-metal music, one with spoken parts, and one with metal. Generally the songs are mid-tempo or even slower than that, but that does not have to be a problem. Many of the songs also rely upon a massive, and often repeated, chorus. Manowar do handle these things with skill, as usual, so there are no problems to be found concerning song quality. \n\nThe best songs on here are King of Kings, Gods of War, and Hymn of the Immortal Warriors. Especially the last one is good, and if more of the songs had been like these this album could have reached a more equal position compared to the rest of Manowar\u2019s song material. However, this album lacks peak quality as well. There are no moments when I actually bawl straight into the air because of pure perfection. \n\nAs a last point, I would also like to comment the story. One thing that is annoying for a starter is that the lyrics are written with some, probably German, rune-alphabet in the booklet, with the key to solve it provided in the end. That is to be too epic and ambitious, even for fans of Manowar. The lyrical content is, as I have mentioned earlier, circling around the Norse gods, and especially Odin. I think that Manowar have either made an innovative, own interpretation of the myths or don\u2019t know that much about the subject. Something tells me that the latter is correct, but what the hell. I just hope the next album is less complex, and \u2026 ehh \u2026 better.\n",
        "\nFinally, the new Manowar album! The warriors from Auburn, New York, sure took their time. Having listened to it around seven times, I can say right off the bat that I\u2019m not disappointed and it was well worth the wait. Some important things to note: Gods of War is easily Manowar\u2019s most ambitious album, as it's a concept album featuring some orchestration and some of the most grandiose and advanced arrangements the band has written. It\u2019s also their most epic album, even surpassing Into Glory Ride and The Triumph of Steel, which the sheer length of some tracks indicates. People expecting the cheesiness of Fighting the World and Kings of Metal will be sorely disappointed (or grateful) though as this is some serious work, reminding me of their early days. \n\nIs it their best album though? Not really, but it\u2019s among their best. It has the same problem that virtually every Manowar album has (well except Hail to England of course), which is consistency problems. There are a lot of first-rate songs on such as \u2018King of Kings\u2019, \u2018Sleipnir\u2019, \u2018Sons of Odin\u2019 and \u2018Gods of War\u2019 but a lot of \u201cdead\u201d time too, i.e. intros, overtures and narration which may or may not bore you. There are quite a few mediocre songs too such as 'Loki God of Fire', \u2018Blood Brothers\u2019 and \u2018Hymn of the Immortal Warriors\u2019. There\u2019s a notable difference to other Manowar albums though: there are no truly awful songs. Every song on here is pretty well written actually, which in the past was not to be expected when you listened to a Manowar album. \n\nThough Gods of War doesn\u2019t have the jaw-dropping energy, attitude and songwriting of Hail to England, it comes pretty darn close in overall quality\u2026 I would say it\u2019s a slight step below Into Glory Ride and Sign of the Hammer, making it their fourth best album. Hence, a recommendation comes naturally, especially to those who like the band but don\u2019t appreciate when they bring forth the cheese, because they will definitely not find any of that here. A good album, I hope to hear more from these US metal warriors in the future.\n",
        "\nManowar come roaring back into the metal world with their long awaited album, Gods of War. Gods of War is full of epic writing, power chords, symphonic elements, and spoken stories. This is both a blessing and a curse depending on which part of Manowar a listener likes.\n\nI for one was massively disappointed with Gods of War. When I listen to Manowar, I prefer more fun, cheesy, and attitude filled music. Gods of War is almost none of that style. Gods of War is a concept album about Odin. And being Manowar \u2013 it\u2019s not just a concept album \u2013 it\u2019s an epic concept album.\n\nMusically, it\u2019s full of symphonic elements. It does start off with a 6 minute symphonic intro to the album. The spoken parts are interesting as it tells of various stories and myths about Odin but the spoken parts are a little too long and a little too often for my taste. The symphonies are a nice addition to the mix but again when Manowar does something \u2013 they never do it half assed. A good half of the album is just symphonic instrumentals with either spoken word or choral singing overlaying the symphonies. Even the traditional metal sounding songs have symphonies in the background.\n\nNow for the more traditional Manowar sounding songs, it does sound like Manowar\u2026just a lot slower and more\u2026epic sounding. The guitar work is mostly power chords with solos thrown into the mix. And the drum and bass work that structures the songs is minimal and foreboding. The guitars are good just not what I expected \u2013 especially after some of the fast songs found on their previous albums.\n\nVocally, the singing is mostly Eric Adams doing is lungs of leather thing. This is great when considering that there are a lot of spoken parts and choir elements found on Gods of War. I appreciate him not trying too hard to change his voice to be more epic as the rest of the album seems to have done. \n\nLyrically, it\u2019s still Manowar \u2013 but more focused on storytelling than previously. Like before, it\u2019s a concept album about Odin and one will find a lot of Norse tales of wolves, steel, Valhalla, and battle on here. Not that it bothered me so much but there is a lot of repetition of stories present. Blood of Odin and the song Odin are basically the same lyrics just one is from a third person perspective and the other is from a first person perspective. Not all that different.\n\nOverall, Manowar will always be Manowar. This album has great fluidity and it is seamless from beginning to end. It is however a little long and repetitive in its conception. Fans of the fast and fun Manowar may not like this album as much (this is me \u2013 I absolutely loved the song Die for Metal \u2013 its not part of the concept album) but other fans are just going to feast on it (like the review previous to mine).\n\nSongs to check out: Die for Metal, King of Kings, Loki God of Fire.\n",
        "\nFew bands can retain the long term popularity and success that Manowar has. Only legendary bands like Maiden, Priest, Ozzy, and Sabbath continue selling records and concert tickets on the scale that Manowar does. How do they do it? Like them or not, they are tremendous showmen. Everything they do is over the top. Their latest release \"The Sons of Odin\" is the perfect example of the group taking something seemingly minuscule\u2014a single\u2014and making it massive. \n\n\"The Sons of Odin\" was supposed to be a mere single; instead, Manowar added two new tracks and two live tracks. The version I am reviewing \"The Immortal Edition\" is an immaculate gatefold album that comes with a slip case cover. This version also comes with a bonus DVD complete with a Fan Convention Documentary, Heart of Steel Choir and Orchestra rehearsal, Earthshaker Fest 2005 promo trailer showing Manowar and the Orchestra playing together in front of thousands of fans, and a slideshow of pictures from the convention with the album's audio tracks playing in 5.1 Surround Sound. \n\nThe album portion of this package begins with two live tracks, \"The Ascension\" and \"King of Kings\". These classic tracks are a testimony to Manowar\u2019s superb live sound. Bands will often exclude any orchestral or keyboard arrangements when playing live. Not Manowar. They perform these tracks exactly as they appeared on the album. After nearly thirty years of screaming his lungs out, Eric Adams still has it in him, perfectly hitting his highs. \n\nThe new tracks are classic Manowar battle hymns. \"Odin\" could be used in a movie score for movies like \"Conan the Barbarian\" or \"Beast Master\". It's melodic notes hover somberly like a warrior sadly watching his family incinerate on a funeral pyre. Horns and drums, and even a gong change the downtrodden tone to one of awe and bravery. \n\nThe grandiose orchestrations of \"Odin\" transition into more classical anthems of might with \"Gods of War\". Like Heimdall signifying the coming of Ragnarok, this track is called in with majestic horns and thunderous kettle drums. The rhythm created by the orchestra is mimicked by Manowar's instruments of electricity and steel\u2014guitar, bass, and drums. The said guitar riff is heavy and potent, the type of rhythm a Norse king would have wanted in his mead hall after a victorious battle. This track will be great for fans to swing their beer to while singing along at home or live. \n\nThe title track is good enough that Manowar could have released it by itself as a single and it would have kept the fans happy. This track features a chugging riff, seemingly made of chain mail backed by magical choirs. The music breaks into a drum and bass verse made to draw attention to Eric Adams valiant narrations. The steely-toned guitar cuts in as Adams voice becomes more frantic, exciting the will for war, until Adams hits his trademark warrior cry near the end of the track. An organ signifies the closing of battle, and what looks like our characters losing the battle. Soon the horns and drums kick in and the narrator (Odin) tells us the warriors hit their berserker rage and overcame their foes. \n\nThe DVD portion shows a documentary of their fan convention. Manowar fans are nuts! They are some of the most faithful fans in all of music, some coming as far as Brazil and Australia to witness this once-in-a-lifetime event. Fans from a total of thirty-five countries came to pay tribute to one of metal's greatest bands. The organizer got with Manowar to put on an awesome spectacle of Manowar memorabilia and events including a framed contract singed in the band's blood on display, a beer drinking contest, fans interview past and present band members, Miss Manowar 2005, and many other events geared toward the Manowar lifestyle. The whole convention was a Manowar fan's dream, which further shows the band\u2019s devotion to its fans. It also makes for a great video for those who couldn't attend this monumental event. Oh yeah, and there were plenty of boobs! \n\nThere are other sections of the DVD worth noting, but the documentary is the majority of the disc. More than enough has been said for this album, especially considering it is only a five-song E.P. Fans of the band will buy this album to see for themselves, anyway. Mark my words, these fans will not be a bit disappointed with the final product. \n\noriginally published on metal-mayhem.co.uk\n",
        "\nManowar is a band known for putting on legendary live shows that literally shake the very ground they walk upon, and now the world has a chance to witness their awesome performance power. Back in 2005, the loudest band in the world arrived in Germany with a camera crew to tape their headlining performance at Earthshaker Fest. The appropriately titled \u201cAbsolute Power\u201d captures Manowar\u2019s sensational live show at Earthshaker Fest that was filmed with high quality equipment to produce the mother of all live DVDs.\n\nThe tracklist for this DVD is the most incredible live set a Manowar fan could ever imagine. Everything from \"Sign Of The Hammer\" to \"The Crown And The Ring\" is played on this monstrous disc, which is filled with twenty two different tracks from Manowar's lengthy catelog. The most surprising part of this DVD is when Manowar warmly welcomes former members to the stage to play songs like \"Metal Warriors\" and \"Dark Avenger\" for this great performance. An orchestra was also added to help enlighten several songs like \"Herz Aus Stahl.\" The orchestra isn't a fantastic part of the show, but it does help maintain the live energy of some of these songs. Manowar manages to remain a true live powerhouse as guitarist Karl Logan nails every solo with ease and singer Eric Adams relentlessly hits incredibly high notes. In terms of live shows and music, this is the Valhalla of DVDs.\n\nEven though the music and live presence of Manowar is great, there is one thing that remains untouchable here: the fans. I've watched several live DVDs before, and never have I seen a group of fans so loyal and excited to be at a live show. Not only do the several camera angles show Manowar's fans singing and moshing to their songs, Manowar constantly gets the crowd involved in songs as they stop and let the group of metalheads sing along to the tracks. I never really believed Manowar's rants about having the greatest fans in the world, but after viewing this DVD, it's clear Manowar has a unique bond with their fans that most other bands don't.\n\nThe bonus disc for Manowar's performance at Earthshaker Fest is a nice addition to the DVD package. The extra DVD contains information about the location of Manowar's show at Earthshaker, the sound and camera equipment used during the concert, footage of Manowar's rehearsal sessions that involved all the band's former and present members, and a massive documentary about Manowar's fan club convention. The fan club documentary shows a huge group of Manowar fans from all over the world gathering for a monstrous convention. The convention has everything from Viking battles to guitar lessons taught by Karl Logan. The bonus disc is a worthy addition to this fantastic DVD.\n\nI honestly have never been this impressed by a live DVD before. This is essential Manowar fans and those who enjoy live DVDs. \n\nThis review was written for: http://www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nThis single suffers from the same thing as their newer albums, namely stupid, keyboard driven interludes that are supposed to sound 'epic' but instead are completely stupid. Here, the title track suffers for it, with the crappy interlude seen in 'King of Kings'.\n\nThe first track, 'The Ascension', is some keyboard driven bullshit with some story about the King of Kings. I realise it's an intro, but it goes on for far too long, and it could've finished before the talking bit (about 40 seconds in). The next track however, is simply awesome, with a fast riff driving it forward, and while the chorus is cheesy it is still good. Around 1:30 you're happily headbanging when it suddenly goes quiet into one of those stupid fucking interludes, which ruins all of the momentum which had been previously built up. After about a minute though, it explodes back into a blazing solo which almost makes up for it, and the track finishes with the chorus. Man, if they had taken out the interlude and replaced it with more soloing, it would be sheer ownage.\n\nSo what we have here is an overlong intro and a great song that is partially ruined because of an interlude which takes up a quarter of the song. Fortunately the good aspects of 'King of Kings' make up for it, but I'd rather not have to fast forward through boring interludes.\n",
        "\nManowar. The name of the group itself can spark a thousand words, yet Manowar is such a legendary band in several ways. Everything from the band's heavy riffing, to the soaring vocals, and to the bloody Viking imagery; Manowar is a hell of a band. There has been a good four year since the world last heard from this dynamic powerhouse, but Manowar fans can once again rejoice. Manowar's newest release, \"The Sons Of Odin,\" is an epic EP that displays the utter dominance of this classic band.\n\nThe two live tracks make this EP shine. \"The Ascension\" and \"King of Kings\" are the featured live tracks on this EP, and they sound fantastic. The production manages to capture the electricity of Manowar's live performance while maintaining a crystal clear sound. The title track off the EP is a classic Manowar song that hardcore fans will gobble up. The traditional metal riffing is right up the alley of classic Manowar songs, yet \"Sons Of Odin\" is clearly part of an evolved Manowar. There are a lot of symphonic and operatic effects scattered throughout the song and it seems darker than older Manowar material.\n\nThis is a really nice EP. \"The Sons Of Odin\" lacks any kind of filler and is an exciting preview of Manowar's new record. If you like Manowar, this is a must have.\n\nThis review was written for: http://www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nAfter the mediocre Fighting the World, Manowar turns their shit around and releases this metal monstrosity. It has all the pieces of a great album; epicness, atmosphere, diversity, talent, catchiness, and absolute heaviness. The only problem with this album, like most Manowar albums, is rather than filling the album entirely with the classic songs that they most certainly are capable of writing, they always throw in a couple useless instrumental or interlude tracks that seriously detract from the album. Kings of Metal is no exception, but they're a little less glaring then they could potentially be.\n\nThe best songs are absolutely obvious. The moment you hear any track on this album, you'll immediately know one of two things: 1. This song is going to absolutely rule or 2. This song is unbelievably lame. The only case this doesn't apply is the Joey DeMaio bass solo where he obnoxiously apes \"Flight of the Bumblebee.\" That one is entirely dependent on whether you think its brilliant or wankery. The rest are very easily divided into classics and shit. \"Wheels of Fire\" is a furious speed metal powerhouse that never lets up. \"Kings of Metal\" is the band's most self-glorifying track, but they do it well enough to make up for it's OTT arrogance. \"Heart of Steel\" is an amazing piano based power ballad, one of the band's most well-written songs and arguably the best song here. Very moving. \"Blood of the Kings\" is stirring and epic, with some cool solo work. \"Kingdom Come\" is a pretty upbeat, but has some cool vocal hooks. \"Hail and Kill\" is the other song arguable as the album's best, a masterful composition that's both heavy and melodic. These songs are the reason for this album's greatness, each one makes you want to take up your sword and head off to battle.\n\nNow on to the shitty ones. \"The Crown and the Ring\" is drawn out and boring, and mostly choir based. \"Pleasure Slave\" is fucking retarded lyrically and too slow musically. \"The Warrior's Prayer\" is a four minute spoken story. I don't see how anyone could listen to these song's more than once, if at all. Why put them on the album at all?\n\nJoey DeMaio is an overrated bassist, but his playing is good here, as is Ross Friedman on guitar, whose solos and riffs are impressive throughout. The drumming is fast and technical, probably their best up to this point. The highlight of this album, like most of their albums, is Eric Adams on vocals. Nobody screams like that guy does; he's pretty much inimitable. His voice makes the lyrics come off not as cheesy but just plain cool.\n\nThis is an impressive album, if you can ignore the worthless filler tracks. The classics on here more than make up for them.\n",
        "\nWhat happened Manowar? Manowar albums generally have a couple absolute classics that redeem any of the shittier songs, but this one doesn't deliver. It's just an album of tolerable metal, nothing more or less. \n\nMy biggest complaint is how generally contrived all the songs sound. It's like they walked into the studio and recorded the first ideas that came to mind. Nothing about the album musically is particularly innovative. All of the riffs, rhythms, solos, fills, etc. come off as incredibly unintricate and uninspired. The lyrics are probably the cheesiest Manowar lyrics ever to grace an album, and not the good cheesy that Manowar usually manages to provide. The songs just don't accomplish anything besides filling up the album. There's no real stand out tracks, although it's clear which tracks suck. \"Drums of Doom\" is the most pitiful attempt at an intro track/drum solo ever, with the other short track \"Master of Revenge\" hot on its heels. \"Blow Your Speakers\" blows, pun intended. If you're going to sing about defying MTV, don't do it in a song that sounds like something fucking Extreme would do. Most of the songs actually border on hard rock, rather than metal, the exception being the furious \"Black Wind, Fire, and Steel,\" and perhaps \"Holy War.\" \"Defender,\" featuring an Orson Welles spoken intro, would be really good if it didn't drag itself to death after the intro. The album is decent to listen to, but it gets really boring, really fast.\n\nThe other big problem is the album's production. Not only are the songs weak as Manowar could have written them, they're recorded in a way that makes them sound even weaker. None of the songs inspire manic head banging, half because of the shitty songwriting, half because of the shitty production. \n\nRedeeming qualities? Eric Adams' over the top vocal performance. He's one of the only vocalists that makes it sound good rather than cheesy, and his high pitched screams are among some of metal's best. Too bad nobody else on this album measures up. \n\nThis is pretty much the sorest spot in the Manowar discography, as they'd be back to powerhouse songwriting by their next album, Kings of Metal. It's worth a shot of you're into Manowar, but it's not half as good as any of their other albums.\n",
        "\nThe whole Barbarian metal thing is awesome, as long as you're not ironic about it. (Well, I don't know any Ironic barbarian metal bands, but I'm sure there are tonnes...). If you're going to do something, do it all the way, and it will be cool. Manowar are an example of this. It would be easy to diss these guys, but these guys' seriousness and just general hardcore-ness makes it awesome, and while some people will laugh about bands like Manowar, they'd never do it to their faces.\n\nFor people who have a passing familiarity with Manowar, the image might turn you off the music before you give it a listen. Don't worry though, it's not as bad as you might imagine. For the most part, Manowar deal in a highly listenable brand of big speed metal riffs, strong, operatic vocals, and big wanky guitar and bass parts. The song that really says all about this band would be the title track. The title track shows you everything that is awesome about Manowar. Check these lyrics:\n\nOnward pounding into glory ride\nSign of the hammer be my guide\nFinal warning all stand aside\nSign of the hammer it's my time\n\nSeriously, those are great lyrics. It's big, it's epic and it's metal as. While there's few places quite as stirring and anthemic as that bit, there's tonnes of awesome riffs and huge solos for you to enjoy. The Oath has some great proto thrash riffing, All Men Play on 10 has some hilarious (if awesome) lyrics and some pretty cool solos and riffs, and Mountain is a ballad that doesn't suck, which is pretty surprising. There's some pretty cool mellow parts, and it's done pretty tastefully. It was a very pleasant surprise, and proof that these guys can write killer songs.\n\nI guess the one thing that lets this album down a bit is the production. Basically, for this kind of stuff you need thick and chunky production. Unfortunately the bass tones are real thin and the guitars don't have enough power in the mix. It's not the end of the world by any means, but it's a pity. On another note, the subject matter of Guyana (Cult of the Damned) is really weird for Manowar, and it's not really all that great a song. Manowar didn't quite have enough for a full album, I think, with a few of the songs being a bit below the mark.\n\nIn the end, this is a solid and thoroughly entertaining album. It's not an amazing work of art that will change your life, but chances are you'll love it and be headbanging along to it in no time, particularly the massive, epic title track. Extremely entertaining and epic. Highly recommended.\n",
        "\nJust when you thought Manowar couldn't get any more epic, any more broad, or any more heroic, they pull this EP out of their ass. It's worth it for the 3 new songs alone (an instrumental, and 2 new songs.) It's darker than Warriors of the World or Dawn of Battle, and more epic than King of Kings, which was included (in a live version) here. What can you expect here? Symphony, midpaced epic anthems. You can expect chanted chorii, and excessive viking themed lyrics.\n\nHowever, as one astute reviewer said, Manowar is Manowar is Manowar. You will only be surprised by the absolute epicness and wagnerian magnitude of this EP. It's surprisingly un-cheesy, but the thing is Manowar have combined the great production values of their newer material with the songwriting of Hail to England and Into Glory Ride, with the darker edge of their newer material. \n\nIf this was longer, this would be my favorite Manowar release. The quality of the material, however, is top notch. A must get.\n",
        "\nManowar is one of those bands that you either completely love or completely hate, there is no middle ground with them. Whether they are going at full throttle, pounding it out slow and heavy, or playing an epic ballad the nature of this band is blatant to the core. They present themselves as they are, and you either take them at face value, or you run like hell before getting your ass kicked off the planet.\n\n\"Kings of Metal\" embodies the spirit of what Manowar has always been better than most of their previous releases, owing mostly to a much stronger production and a lyrical approach that departs from the MTV subject matter found on \"Fighting the World\". The guitars are loud, the bass and drums are thunderous, and the vocals pierce through the wall of sound and tell grand tales of true metal.\n\nThere aren't really any bad songs on here, but there are some songs that require some perspective as they tend to differ from the more traditional rock all the time approach that Manowar has previously held to. I have thus broken these songs down into 4 categories.\n\nThe fast cookers: \"Wheels of Fire\" is pure speed metal with an amazing chorus and tons of flashy guitar leads. \"Hail and Kill\" is another fast one with a ton of lyrical metaphors to the take no prisoners approach Manowar has to metal. \"Blood of the Kings\" is a long winded speed anthem with one of Eric Adam's most amazingly dramatic vocal performances ever.\n\nThe power ballads: \"The Crown and the Ring\" is a slow lamenting orchestral and choral arrangement that focuses pretty much on vocal performance and lyrical storytelling. \"Hear of Steel\" is by far the greatest track on here, and embodies the same heroic lyrical storytelling that Lost Horizon continues to emulate. Great piano and guitar work on this one, and yet another unforgettable performance by Adams.\n\nThe Mid-tempo rockers: \"Kings of Metal\" is an energetic audience pleaser that pretty much embodies Manowar's live shows. Definately tailored for live consumption. \"Kingdom Come\" is a bit flat in terms of structure, and is my pick for the weak link on this album, but still has some fairly solid riffs in the guitar tracks. \"Pleasure Slave\" is definately a lyrical satire, and all one has to do is take notice of the year that the album was released. Obviously Joey DeMaio, being a supporter of free speech, was revolted by Tipper Gore's fascist campaign against lyrical freedom in music and decided to give that prude bitch something to complain about. The song is a bit slow and repetitive, but the lyrics are down right hillarious, and when you take into account who they are intended towards it is twice as humerous. Obviously not for the politically correct, although if you are offended by stuff like this, you probably don't have the intestinal fortitude for the entire genre and should probably check out the country music scene.\n\nThe Outliers: \"Sting of the Bumblebee\" is probably one of the craziest conceptions ever realized, doing a rendition of Rimsky Korsakoff's \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" on a bass guitar, not exactly the easiest instrument to perform such a piece on. This is the reason why I say Joey DeMaio is a better bassist than Cliff Burton. \"The Warrior's Prayer\" is a rather interesting narrative that leads into \"Blood of the Kings\". Although it is a bit overly dramatic at times, it does embody the nature of the band, 4 barbarian/viking lords of the 4 winds.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a must have for fans of fast, melodic, heavy metal. With the exception of \"The Triumph of Steel\", this is about as fast as it gets with Manowar. Crossover appeal to power metal and speed metal fans on this one, as well as appeal to the traditional target audience. I Highly recommended picking it up today.\n",
        "\nI've said it before, and it shall be enunciated again - metal is nothing without atmosphere. When done correctly, metal can summon the most incredible feelings of fantasy and escapism, and this is the one overweening criteria which I use to judge any album I hear. It is well then, that 'Warriors of the World' nails its glorious heavy metal niche straight through the fucking face. \n\nThis is the true spirit of metal incarnate; Manowar make no attempt to tone down their outrageous excesses, or conform to any kind of pattern. What other metal band would put three power ballads, two neo-classical compositions and one 'intro' track slap in the heart of an album, following it up with four straight head smashers?\n\nThis is a band fully in tune with their hearts of solid steel; the album is a grandiose, dramatic, pulverising, glorious, wildly OTT testament \nto the spirit of the warrior. From the mighty ballad 'Swords in the Wind' through the - frankly - insanly overblown rendition of 'Nessun Dorma' to the total metallic destruction of 'Call to Arms' or 'Fight Until We Die', Manowar give ample evidence to support the claim that they are, indeed, the Kings of Metal. The excellent musicianship - particularly by the vocalist, Eric Adams - and thunderously heavy, not-too-clean production do not hurt at all either.\n\nMy head says that this is ridiculous, but my heart tells it to fuck off. This is everything that I love about the genre encapsulated within a single 47 minute block.\n",
        "\nBut seriously, I have always had the nagging feeling Manowar are giving into commercialism. For one, although I have had nothing but love for their new work, it makes me think... why didn't release Sons of Odin, King of Kings, and The Dawn of Battle singles with Warriors of the World? To keep up with the theme, I would've loved it if they took out the patriotic mumbo jumbo from WotW and put these songs in. Seriously. This single would've made a kickass opener for WotW. \n\nIt functions as 1 song, in that The Ascension is more of an intro. It tells the tale, of, well, a man's ascension to the throne of King of Kings, and his newfound power from the gods, and how he used that power. The song, in itself, is one of my favorite Manowar songs. It's really great. As a single, this thing owns. The keyboards are used QUITE well, and Manowar have FINALLY found a good production after Kings of Metal. Their pre-Kings of Metal was a bit messy, and their 1990's albums were too clean. Here, as with Warriors of the World, they hit the jackpot. \n\nAgain, I don't know why they didn't just put these songs in Warriors of the World, even IF they had to delay the release for ANOTHER 2 or so years. At least they wouldn't have had to put shit in that album like An American Trilogy and Fight For Freedom. \n\nHowever, back to the single. It's great. I cannot find a single fault with it, aside from its short length. It's just great. Get it, some way. Download it, Itune it, or get Hell on Earth IV. Just get it. It's really great. Lots of keyboards, nice mid-fast speed, great lyrics about being the King of Kings.\n",
        "\nOK...by Manowar standards this is not quite their greatest effort. But it is still rock solid and still head and shoulders above most of what was out in 1996, since the 90s were a terrible time for metal in general. (I don't wanna hear anybody arguing that point, you WILL lose any debate you initiate with me on the subject.) \n\nThe production is better than \"Kings Of Metal\", in my opinion; much thicker and with more low end than that album. But it still is very clear, with a great drum sound and a meatier bass than before, but it still has that high-end clang you associate with Joey DeMaio. Unfortunately the guitars are not as loud in the mix as I'd like, at least the rhythm tracks are, but Karl Logan still has a damn good tone anyway, nice and crunchy with some subtle effects burnishing the edges. Scott Columbus' heavy handed style is accented perfectly by this big drum sound, making him sound like cannon fire. It's big and loud, but not as overdone as some 80s drum sounds were. Eric's vocals are surprisingly dry on this album with very little ambience, but a great vocalist like him doesn't need much in the way of assistance of that sort. \n\nPerformance-wise, I firmly disagree with the last reviewer, as I think Manowar sound like a well-oiled unit running on all cylinders on this album. Karl Logan really tears out of the starting gate on this album whenever solo time comes around, unleashing some pretty terrifying shredding to say the least, especially on \"Return of the Warlord\", where his solo threatens to spin out of control every second yet he reins it in like the pro he is. Only thing is, I'd like to hear more bluesy finger/wrist vibrato from him as opposed to whacky whammy bar vibrato. \n\nJoey may not be as maniacal as he was on past albums, but he still authoritatively nails it down like few others--most metal bassists just plod along, but he throws in plenty of little fills and chords to show you he's there and he's not just sitting on his ass pedaling the changes. No bass solo, but I'll live. Eric Adams does just fine, injecting even more attitude and style into his inimitable vocals than before. Yes, he is a little more restrained too, but it works for this album, and he gets in his usual screams here and there like on \"The Power\", and the chorus on \"Outlaw\". And on \"Courage\" he sounds just as sensitive and heartfelt as he ever did. \n\nHowever, for the most part the lyrics are not as inspired as past outings, I will agree on that much. \"Return of the Warlord\" in particular has some pretty silly and juvenile lyrics, and the following tracks, \"Brothers of Metal Pt. I\", \"The Gods Made Heavy Metal\", and \"Number One\" are not much better, laying on the cliches more than I'd like. I was slightly disappointed by that area of the album. \"Outlaw\" and \"King\" fare better, though, and \"Courage\", while not as inspiring as \"Heart Of Steel\", still relays its message effectively enough for me. And I could've done without the lengthy instrumental \"Today Is A Good Day To Die\", as it drags on too long, skilled as Karl is on the guitar front.\n\nThe music still shreds and pounds as only Manowar can, however. It still is waaaay better than most of what we call \"true\" metal these days. This is a more mid tempo album, but blazers like \"Outlaw\" and \"The Power\" speed things up a bit and provide some needed variety. I'd still recommend this to many nascent bangers over the latest Lamb of KillSwitch God Forbid clones any day, though \"Kings Of Metal\", \"Sign Of The Hammer\", and \"Hail To England\" will still be the first Manowar albums I recommend to the likes of them anyway. Still worth your time, this one is.\n",
        "\nThis, despite what I said about Kings of Metal, is Manowar's best CD. I was wrong about Kings of Metal; this new approach to the \"Manowar\" style is probably the most effective and, well, the best. Though there are bad songs on this album (Fight For Freedom, An American Trilogy), they are easily ignorable. The rest of the songs have the viking passion, Wagnerian intensity and theatre, and overall dramatic, coldblooded vigour not seen in other Manowar albums, which seem like something as flippant and happy as DragonForce in comparison to this beast. This is the album where Manowar became much more serious, with less light-hearted anthems like King, Number One, Return of the Warlord, The Gods Made Heavy Metal, Metal Warriors, Kings of Metal, Wheels of Fire, or, hell, about 90% of Manowar's entire back catalogue. \n\nThough I am reviewing in context of a bootleg that combines \"The Dawn of Battle\" with \"Warriors of the World\", both are great. The opener, Call To Arms, floored me with the darkness that I had never expected out of Manowar. Though I was a bit unimpressed by the rather tepid and flaccid, and to tell the truth, boring, Fight For Freedom, I was instantly brought back in by the song Nessun Dorma. Now, most people hate that song. I don't. I love it. As a fan of classical music, I've always loved Manowar's more classical dabblings, like Master of the Wind and Crown and the Ring. This one floored the rest; Eric Adams impressed me, and the combination of opera and metal at the end of the song was probably the most moving and incredible moments Manowar have ever achieved. The next song, Vallhalla, which is a symphonic intro to Swords in the Wind, would've been better if it weren't so short, but eh, it has the same melody as Swords in the Wind, and still is a crushing intro. Swords in the Wind is a tribute to the Viking raids on France and England, on the Viking side, and is Manowar's best power ballad, beating out the beloved Heart of Steel. 1 more symphonic track, a narcopaleptic cover of 3 patriotic oldies, and 3 solid fast, crushing, yet darkly symphonic songs later, the album ends, with a magnimonious bang not heard in other Manowar albums. The sheer impact of this album, combined with the surprising darkness, makes this release far more impactive, and, to tell you the truth, less lighthearted, and the best of Manowar's catalogue.\n",
        "\nAfter the relatively tame \"Fighting The World\", this was a welcome blast of renewed power and fury from the Kings of Metal, and the title says it all. In fact, as the title of this review implies, for me this was the album where they really started hitting their stride and getting into the groove that characterizes their current sound and style. Those who don't like it, well, they're fucking poseurs. There, I said it, get over it. \n\nThere is very little to not like on this album, the only song I really don't care for being \"Pleasure Slave\". I know Manowar are not to be taken 100% seriously, but this song is just plain silly. And I don't care for a song that says \"WOMAN, BE MY SLAVE!\" in this context, speaking as somebody who loves women and is at the same time not the most PC guy around, contrary to what you may think here. Other than this, let 'er rip! \n\nThe production is excellent, but a little too trebly for my taste; a little extra bottom end would've made this positively devastating and truly speaker-shattering. The drums boom and crack they way they ought to (MINUS triggers!), the guitars are clear and crispy-crunchy, the bass rattles your sternum anyway, and Eric Adams is right in front leading the charge as only he can with his inimitable vocal stylings. Virtually no-one can match his conviction, power, range, and sense of style and class (not to mention his diction) in the American scene, such as it is these days especially. Yeah, I know, RJD, but even he is losing it due to age these days. Sad but true. \n\n\"Wheels Of Fire\" kicks things off in high gear (pun intended) with a speedy paean to driving entirely too damn fast and loving every second of it. Excellent solo here from Ross The Boss, too. \"Kings Of Metal\" spells it out loud and clear for the unbelievers: \"Other bands play--MANOWAR KILLS!!!\" Need we say more? Of course, and this is where a damn fine ballad with balls like Kongzilla rears its head, the beautiful \"Heart Of Steel\", one of my personal theme songs in life. A ballad with this level of balls is a truly rare thing, so enjoy it when it does come around. \n\nThen comes the inevitable bass solo, and again, disbelievers and haters can get the fuck over the fact that Joey DeMaio is one of the baddest bassists in America if not the baddest period. Anybody who can take \"Flight of the Bumblebee\", one of the most technically demanding violin pieces ever written (by composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov), and shred it at full tempo balls out with massive amounts of aggression and passion on the bass is a god, in my book. The walls of wild and crazed noise he unleashes between verses of this tune are terrfiying! \n\n\"The Crown and the Ring (Lament of the Kings)\" gives me chills to listen to with its male choir and Eric going on about how this will be his last battle, commending his life to the All Father. Fantastic! \n\n\"Kingdom Come\" is one of Manowar's trademark \"follow your dreams\" songs, and it has the usual vastly uplifting effect--who says heavy metal is all negative and depressing and evil? \"Hail And Kill\", well, you gotta scream along with that huge chorus! Ownage personified on that part alone. \n\nAnd hey...I LIKE \"The Warrior's Prayer\", it sets up the bombastic and classic ending cut, \"Blood Of The Kings\" perfectly. OK, so the ending declaration of \"THEY...WERE THE METAL KINGS!!!\" is kinda silly, but it fits the whole Manowar over the top image, so why the hell not? \"Blood Of The Kings\" is the perfect and ultimate Manowar album ender to end them all, even over \"Black Wind, Fire, And Steel\", with its devastating power and sense of epic grandeur. Do I love this album? Does Joey DeMaio have a big ego? Of course on both counts! This belongs in the collection of any headbanger worthy of the ti\n",
        "\nMost people who call Manowar boring and cliche seem to forget they are still in possesion of four of the best heavy metal albums, being Battle Hymns, Into Glory Ride, Hail to England and Sign of the Hammer. Now Sign of the Hammer seems to be forgotten by most of the fans I know, which I think is a great shame.\n\nThe album opens with All Men play on 10, which is a good song and a lot better than Blow your Speakers from the Fighting the World album. The lyrics are fun and the music is solid slow-paced heavy metal the way it's supposed to be. The next song Animal speeds everything up and will manage to get your head banging. It's definitly the least good song on the album, but it still stands strong on it's own. I compare it most of the time with Fight Tooth and Nail by Virgin Steele.\n\nFrom these two songs on everything gets only better and better. Thor the Powerhead is a classic headbanger in the same way as Revelation and Blood of my Enemies. It's epic, fast and has some great vocal and basswork. Mountains is a ballad which doesn't get boring at all, it has an atmosphere of greatness all over it. Eric Adams sounds like a God in the same way only people like Dio or David Defeis can sound like.\n\nThe speed returns with Sign of the Hammer and The Oath, which are both really cool fast metal tracks like Kill with Power from Hail to England. Thunderpick is a bassolo, and whether you like it or not (I do), I think it's one of the best Joey ever played. Then comes Guyana (cult of the damned) to close the album. Once again all the right ingredients are here: the astonishing vocal work, the incredible bassplay, smashing drumwork and a great guitarsolo.\n\nI don't know if I like Into Glory ride more than Sign of the Hammer, but I do know these two albums are by far the best and interesting they ever released. If you want to know where bands like Wotan got their inspiration from, you should buy them both. In fact, I like to stress this to be a 'buy or die' release. Case closed.\n",
        "\nHere, we have a flawed work that clearly shows how Manowar have grown. The production, while being significantly cleaner than Kings of Metal, is wonderfully heavy, with a solid bass and gritty guitar, with wonderful licks courtesy of David Shankle. The drum sound is monumensious, and the performance is bone crushing. \n\nAside from that, what makes Manowar great? Is it the endless posturing on how metal they are? No, and that's the flaw that grew out of proportion on Louder Than Hell -- a belief that someone possesses a quality simply because he says he does. Manowar are no more metal here than they were on Kings of Metal, yet here, they seem to be more obsessive about it; even on the songs where the subject isn't metal. The lyrical content is matured, approaching other subject areas besides vikings, odin, and battle, like the Cherokee, for which Manowar were brave enough to admit they were pretty good fighters. But behind all that, what's really here? An album with lots of headbanging moments and plenty of anthemic songs, plus an outstanding drum performance. Isn't that what Manowar have always been about?\n\nBut, alas, there's the song \"Achilles, Ecstasy, and Agony in 8 parts.\" This song would've been a wonderful, albiet schmaltzy, but overall very epic and incredible if it was a.) at the end, and b.) without the incessent soloing, and c.) not quite as jarring and abrupt. If Manowar had explored the idea enough, it would've made an excellent, albiet not as long song. \n\nSo, what we have here is a bunch of great, NEW ideas (that they would milk for another decade), but haven't quite been used correctly. Think of it as Manowar for the 90's. Sadly enough, it would end up being by far Manowar's best CD of the 90's, with Louder Than Hell, too inconsistent to hold much value to anybody who actually appreciates Manowar not for being metal, but for being epic and glitzy.\n",
        "\nHere, Manowar stumble upon what made them great, and fill an album with it entirely -- instantly memorable melodies, an epic, wagnerian sense of battle and a trueness to ones heart. They produce what can only be described as the 20th century version of the Ride of the Valkyries. They sing songs about warriors and their dark journeys, and overall, it is probably the most inspired and least obnoxiously self-congratulatory of their work. Sure, they have the self congratulatory anthems (Kings of Metal, Wheels of Fire), but at least those are GOOD songs. \n\nHere, they explore ideas that work. The riffs here are classic and anthemic, and scream of being warriors, so not only do they say they're warriors, but you actually believe them. They also made their best ballad -- Heart Of Steel. Generally, the ballads and the speedfests are Manowar's strength, simply because they have the courageous abandon not found in their mid-tempo songs. In that sense, the song \"Kings of Metal\" is almost out of place here, but it still works, so it's forgiveable. The semi-fast songs here like Blood of the Kings or Hail and Kill are possessive of the anthemic qualities, while not overtly declaratory of them; you believe that Manowar are the Kings of Metal, instead of them having to tell you like they did in the title track. They don't have to congratulate themselves on most of the songs -- they simply talk about, well, Hailing and Killing. However, this album isn't perfect. The song Pleasure Slave is out of the general theme of the album, and is quite a non-sequitur. The other, The Warrior's Prayer, is simply pointless and shouldn'tve been there in the first place. \n\nThe production here is simply superb. The guitars are expansive and carry the music, instead of simply being dragged along with it. Everything is sharp edged and big here. This release has the best production of any Manowar release, simply because it radiates outward -- a property Manowar found tough to replace, and never did a good job of getting such a radiant production job on any of their subsequent releases.\n",
        "\nI bought this release a while back, and was expecting something, well, louder than hell. I was expecting something that was outrageous, ultra-cheesy, ultra-ManOwaR, and just all-out. I was gravely disappointed. What I got was a rather average heavy metal album, and by ManOwaR's standards, a really poor album. The way I see it, there are 3 basic flaws with this album that prevent it from being good. I'll list them from least important to most important:\n\nSongwriting: Really horrible. The songs are really uninspiring, and many of their songs on this album are just unmemorable, like \"The Power\", \"The Gods Made Heavy Metal\", and \"King\". The riffs here aren't nearly as heavy or as amazing as they were on such classics as Sign of the Hammer, Kings of Metal, or Triumph of Steel. The songs aren't anywhere near as epic, either, as the aforementioned releases, and overall fail. While there are 3 good (not great) but good songs (Brothers of Metal, pt 2; Courage; and Outlaw), the rest are really subpar, and even have horrid songs like Return of the Warlord and Number 1 that are so bad I can't even listen to them. Also, in addition to having really poor riffs in those songs, the traditionally epic, cheesy, but overall excellent lyrics ManOwaR are known for are just not there; on those songs the lyrics are unlistenable. However, those songs have other flaws, too, like their performance.\n\nPerformance: Really, really, simple. Unlike his performance on Kings of Metal, or Rhino's bone crushing performance on Triumph of Steel, Scott Columbus does a really lackluster drum performance here. It's always the same beats, no variation, no nothing, no sparkle, and nothing memorable here. Joey DeMaio has a similar plague; the bass here is really not what Manowar's bass is known for, it's more of a simple, subdued rock bass as opposed to his usual killer guitar-like bass performance. Karl Logan, while having some good solos, doesn't really deliver here. His performance, like the rest of the band, is totally without frills, and seems to be lacking any sort of inspiration. Even Eric Adams' vocals suck here, for the most parts. Gone are the dazzling falsettos and air horn like screams of the past; for most of the release it's Eric Adams talking, not Eric Adams singing. I didn't pay to hear him talk. The typically jaw dropping and dramatic performances he's known for are just absent here. Next flaw:\n\nProduction: Here the production is very, very, clean. Too clean. There is no echo, no reverb, no nothing. The drums are flat and listless. The guitars are flat and listless, plus being a.) WAY too mixed down, and b.) not enough tracks present. Eric Adams' voice is flat and listless. The bass is flat and listless. Hell, they should've named this \"Flatter Than Hell.\" That would've been more accurate, as this is anything BUT loud; it's more flat, clean, and complacent. The production here, unlike the dirty and dramatic production of Kings of Metal, or the heavy as fuck production on Triumph Of Steel, is unmemorable and mixed wrong. Hell, the rating on this album would've been raised about 10 points if the production was more sparkly and less flat. \n\nHence, you can tell the basic flaw with this album: It is mediocre and unmemorable. There are 3 good songs, which I have already mentioned. There are 3 unmememorable songs, which I have also already mentioned. And there are 2 horrid songs. The other two songs are pointless. Today is a Good Day To Die is just too drawn out, and My Spirit Lives on is a pointless guitar solo. The problem that prevents songs like Brothers of Metal and Courage from being totally awesome is that the guitars are mixed too low. I want the guitars to be up front and, well, louder than hell in those anthemic songs; here it's listless and flaccid. Outlaw is really the only great, relatively unflawed songs. If they made all their songs that great, put more choirs and WAY more guitars in Brothers of Metal and Courage, we'd have a GREAT release. Another problem is King. It begins as if it's gonna be an epic song about kings and heroes and regicide. Instead, we have a lame rockish song. BAIT AND SWITCH! Not good at all. Plus on that song, the drumming's even WORSE than it was on the rest of the CD. \n\nGet this if you're a diehard Manowar fan... else, get Triumph of Steel, Kings of Metal, Sign of the Hammer, Fighting the World, Hail to England, Into Glory Ride, Warriors of the World, or Battle Hymns.\n",
        "\nManowar. Yeah, loin cloths, swords and metal. I love a lot of Manowar's music, but sometimes the image is just funny. When I first heard Manowar, I thought it was just a big joke. Oh well, enough about the image... onto \"Louder Than Hell\".\n\nThe album kicks off strong, with \"Return of the Warlord\". This is a great track, with a very simple hard rock oriented riff. There are some awesome pounding drums, they just remind me of high speed chases for some reason, just pounding and chugging along. The vocals here are amazing, but Eric Adams always puts on a good show. The bass is pretty good; not as pronounced as before, but some really cool ideas are put to music.\n\n\"Brothers of Metal, Pt. 1\" is next, and man, is this a catchy song. The hard rock style riff starts it off, with some more excellent vocal work. A very epic, apocalyptic feeling is used with the drums... (drums of doom anyone?). That chorus is awesome! So catchy. But anyways, the guitar riffing isn't too great, but the power chord all seem to be in the right places. The bass work on this song is awesome. There are some higher bass notes that roll along, especially on the chorus. There is some really cool trem picking and tapping on the solo, very nicely done. This track is just so damn catchy! \n\nNext up, \"The Gods Made Heavy Metal\". Once again, catchy as hell. The riff is really cool on the opening, and the chugging drums are back. The vocals are great on this track as well. This is another driving, pounding, anthemic song, that is just as catchy as \"Brothers of Metal\", if not so, then more.\n\n\"Courage\". Man, I just can't really listen to this one. A ballad, I guess, but not a great one. The vocals are good, though a little too drawn out and almost whiney. The music is pretty simple, just some orchestra samples in the back giving an epic feel, with piano overtop. It kicks in with a rather simple drum beat and chord progression. There is actually a pretty cool solo mixed in there, but it's not good enough to want to listen to the song. The bass work is pretty good, but once again, not enough so to make this a repeated listen.\n\nAfter the ballad, we have a pretty solid track \"Number 1\". By now the album starts to get a little samey, but if you take it track by track, this song is very good on it's own. A really cool riff and the pounding drums again. Eric Adams sounds fine once again, and the bass plods along with some nice fills. A very catchy chorus, but the vocals just get a little much, almost too whiney for such a powerful voice. A rather lackluster solo thrown in the middle, it's just not very exciting. This song is good, but it's not as good as the first three tracks.\n\n\"Outlaw\" speeds things up, almost to speed metal levels. The drums almost sound like something Overkill would do. The guitar is pretty fast, and the bass is pretty non-existant. The vocals are excellent. A little too high pitched towards the end though. There is a nice segment in the middle where there are some church bells and slower drums, but then it picks back up, and has a really cool tapping style solo.\n\n\"King\" starts off a lot like \"Courage\". Just really ballady (is that a word? you know what I mean). I don't really think Manowar's strong point is ballads, maybe they shouldn't write soft songs anymore. Right before I get ready to hit the track skip button, a nice 80's style guitar riff comes crashing in. Very nice! The pounding drums, the palm muting guitars, the rolling bass, the excellent vocals. It's all there. And it keeps going until the solo. Then it goes again. A good track, but a little samey once you get into the main portion of the song.\n\n\"Today is a Good Day to Die\" is next. It starts off very epic sounding, taking nearly four minutes for a little, slow solo to kick in. It slows down into a piece with piano and orchestra again. But then it kicks in with some heavier riffs and drums. Then it's over. I guess some vocals wouldn't hurt, but as far as an epic sounding interlude (that last's nearly ten minutes) it's pretty good. Maybe a little too drawn out.\n\nAfter such a slow epic track, it's nice Manowar picked things up with \"My Spirit Lives On\". This is bascially sting of the bumblebee part II, in my opinion. It's just two minutes of fast finger tapping and feedback. It's gets a little too high pitched and keeps climbing... a little overdone I believe. But it still picks up the speed...\n\n\"The Power\" is the closer, and it starts off in an excellent fashion. This track definitely adds more depth into this album, it's just too bad they waited until the last track to change some things up. The drums still have that driving sound, the guitar is pretty cool, with some speed metal riffs and some really cool chord choices on the slower parts. The vocals are excellent. This track definitely shows that Manowar sounds much better when the tempo is faster. Once again a cool solo is played, then speed is picked back up to finish it off. Definitely a great way to finish off the album!\n\nAs with any other Manowar album, I find the lyrics largely amusing. I just can't take the lyrics seriously, especially on \"The Gods Made Heavy Metal\" and \"Brothers of Metal\". With lines like:\n\"The Gods made heavy metal / and saw that it was good / they said to play it louder than hell / we promised that we would\" and \"Our heart are filled with metal / and masters we have none / and will die for metal / metals heals, my son\" \nhow can you go wrong? It just seems to me that singing about metal is a little cliche and humorous. Whether it's supposed to be a joke or not doesn't really matter. The music is expertly played. The songwriting is definitely a hit, especially considering the catchiness of most of the tracks. The vocals are amazing, except for the whiney parts on the ballads.\n\nThis is definitely a great album. Sure there are parts that aren't the best, but overall this is a good album. Seems to be more hard rock oriented than their previous efforts, but the roots of metal are still there. A good album by a great band! Manowar fans better already own this (since you can get it for less than $5). I would recommend this album to fans of traditional heavy metal, as well as power metal fans! Every metal head should own this album, if not for the music, then for the humor.\n",
        "\nLouder than Hell is the album that should have followed Kings of Metal. Just plain old ass kicking heavy metal, not nearly as much filler and crap like what was found on The Triumph of Steel. Sure there are a few boring songs on here, this is Manowar after all. But all in all this is easily one of their best albums.\n\nLike others have stated, the first 3 songs are all stellar. Return of the Warlords is my favorite, and possibly my favorite Manowar song ever. So simple, so cheesey, yet so awesome. That chorus is godly, probably the catchiest thing I've ever heard. \"We do just what we feel, riding horses made of steel, we're here...To burn up the NIGHT!\" Brothers of Metal is next, and is more of the same. Simple, catchy, fist pumping metal. \"Brothers of metal! We are fighting with power and steel, fighting for metal, metal that's real!\" The Gods Made Heavy Metal is, suprise suprise, more of the same. Great song, really really nice riff and a blazing solo.\n\nNow we move on to Courage, and the album takes a big dive here. Going from 3 awesome heavy metal anthems to a ridiculously cheesey ballad. Adams sounds great, but this song is just boring, sorry. Luckily they pick things back up with Number One, it's a great song though it lacks the hook that the first 3 songs have. Outlaw is pure speed metal, catchy chorus and nice riffing. The only fault I have is Adams' screams sound weak in comparison to how he sounded on the previous albums. King starts off sounding just like Courage, but then turns into one of the better songs on the album. If they had knocked off that intro this song would fucking slay(it still does I guess, but I hate having to skip over that intro.)\n\nToday is a Good Day to Die, well if you know Manowar you knew a song like this was coming. Can't blame them for trying. My Spirit Lives On is a 2 minute guitar solo, and it's pretty damn impressive. Power ends the album on a high note. It definetly has a Painkiller vibe to it, big time. Great song, one of the best on the album for sure.\n",
        "\nA rarity these days.. a new Manowar track, as part of the package with their latest DVD, Hell on Earth 4.\n\nManowar have released 4 studio albums since Kings Of Metal, that amounts to 19 years and four albums. So any new song is a big deal.\n\nThe first track, the Ascension, is more of an intro, lots of keyboards, chords, spoken bits.. not a bad track but you wonder why... its again not strictly a metal track as no guitar or drum is to be seen. But half of Manowar's tracks in these past 19 years have been like this. Im sure they have made less than 30 metal tracks in this time.\n\nKing Of Kings is definitely metal. Another powerful Manowar track here.. very fast and Eric is in fine form. There is some reprieve in the middle with a slower bit like the one in Battle Hymns, but then it rattles your bones again and takes off. This is typical Manowar, I really cant describe it any other way. Fast but not as fast as Wheels Of Fire. Catchy chorus, as always from these guys. \n\nThey write fantastic music. Its just such a pity that they, particularly Joey, must act like such wankers with their 'war on everything thats not metal/posers'. They themselves are posers. However, take away anything visual, and Manowar are great lyrics and you have potentially the finest songwriters in metal. They are talented and I am hugely looking forward to their new album, hopefully sometime before 2010.\n",
        "\nI've always admired Manowar's gig. Their obnoxious macho \"DEATH TO FALSE METAL!\" and \"other bands play, Manowar kills\" attitude was always a funny thing to me. It shows a lot of wit and silly light heartedness into an otherwise mostly serious genre (with your list of exceptions you're thinking of as you're reading this sentence). Now on to the music: The production is fairly clean. The guitar has a nice metal fuzz, but still is clean enough to hear Ross the Boss's manical shredding, and the bass is well heard to a large extent. It's quite loud, and the drums sound real good for this album, in a \"pump you up\" sort of way. The riffs played are very catchy (the first five songs) and really can get you riled up (it did to me). Eric Adam's energetic low to high epic metal vocals, and his sing along choruses, just fit perfectly into the songs, and I think just work real well for Manowar. Here's a synapsis of the songs:\n\n1. Blood of my Enemies- the intro is real strange, and slow, but then it gets thrusted into a heavy riffing session with Adams singing about killing people and blood and all that fun stuff. A pretty interesting solo as well, with a good ol' sing along chorus. Good song.\n\n2. Each dawn I die- This song is really strange. The riff gives a real strange feeling to me whenever I hear, but it's how that riff earns its catchy badge. Another sing along chorus as well, and a nice falsetto note you can try to reach if you can.\n\n3. Kill with Power- This song is, in my opinion, the best and most \"Manowar\" song on the album. The drum intro that speeds up just gets you pumped real big, then a single driving E5 chord played at high speeds with Adams serenading you about war and all that jazz (metal), with, once again, another good chorus (KILL WITH POW-WUH! DIEEE DIEEE!). It's just a high energy song.\n\n4. Hail to England- Another catchy riff, with another sing along chorus, with another badass solo. The formula works. Hail to England!\n\n5. Army of Immortals- I like how Adams is referencing the past albums in the first part of the song, then sings about metal kicking ass and such. A bit more epic than the first four, but it still has all the past elements of the other songs. Pretty good.\n\n6. Black Arrow- This track is just fucked up, but not in a bad way. The beginning is a hilarious passage about \"each note I now play being a Black Arrow of Death sent straight to the hearts of all those who play FALSE METAL!\" followed by an obnoxious battle cry. What happens next is an indecipherable flurry of harmonics and distorted bass scales being churned out at an incredible rate by DeMaio. I imagine this track would fairly scary to those who don't know what the hell's happening, or if they play false metal.\n\n7. Bridge of Death- Epic, yet completely ridiculous. Different, yet completely ridiculous. More instrumental display, yet completely ridiculous. Get the point? This is the best (funniest) song about Satan, ever. And moreover, it displays the peak of musicianship within the band. A fairly solid 9 minute closer to a fun to listen to album.\n\nIn conclusion, if you dig badass solos and energetic pump you up riffs, please listen to this. Hell, if you've just looking for a good laugh, listen to this album.\n",
        "\nThe year was 2002, the love it or hate it \"Warriors of the World\" album had just been released. When the kings of metal announced \"The Dawn of Battle\" single, there were many skeptics. The line was drawn between the lovers and the haters of \"Warriors of the World\". With this in mind, this new single would have a great impact on Manowar's fan base.\n\nThe major problem with \"Warriors of the World\" was the fact that it contained two awful tracks compared to Manowar's standards. \"An American Trilogy\" and \"Nessun Dorma\" were filler on a brilliant album. This said, the two new songs present on the \"The Dawn of Battle\" single had to be very ass kicking to redeem \"Warriors of the World\". But this review is not about that album so let's focus on the task at hand.\n\nThe first track off this single is a new one called \"The Dawn of Battle\". This tune starts off superbly with a heavy riff and drum beat. Once Eric Adams enters the picture, the song can only get better...and it does. \"The Dawn of Battle\" is an instant classic and fan favourite. The chorus is simple but beautiful. The line \"My sword will drink blood\" is sure to make every wimp and poser run for the nearest exits. This is what the song is all about and the atmosphere that it creates. The drumming on this song is masterful. Scott Columbus really owns the drum kit and uses the double kick perfectly. The song slows down a little before the four minute mark, which gives Eric Adams a chance to showcase his Godly voice. He utilises this opportunity to his advantage. When the song picks up again at the five minute mark, Manowar delivers a swift ass kicking upon the listener.\n\nUp next is the new song, \"I Believe\". Like \"The Dawn of Battle\" this tune is a winner. \"I Believe\" starts off with a classic epic Manowar intro. The organ kicks into pure heavy metal. Eric Adams starts off with very dark vocals but then enters the extremely catchy chorus. This song is definitely going to become a fan favourite at live performances. Karl Logan provides a killer solo increasing the lovability of this track.\n\nNext on deck is \"Call to Arms\". This masterpiece can be found on \"Warriors of the World\". This song is one Manowar's best ever and ranks very high up with other anthems like \"Kill with Power\" and \"Hail and Kill\". A brilliant song. \nIn conclusion, this single is a must for all the casual fans and the legions of followers that the modern day warriors have gained over the years. This single is essential because it replaces the void that was left by \"Warriors of the World\" for the haters but also adds to the awesomeness of the experience for all the lovers of the album. Scott Columbus and Eric Adams provide outstanding performances but we can't forget the amazing talent that Karl Logan and the master, Joey DeMaio display. \"The Dawn of Battle\" is highly recommended for its glorious title track but also for the other incredible songs.\n",
        "\nWARNING!\nThis program contains drinking, fucking, partying, nudity, explicit lyrics, obscene language, and more sex than most people will ever dream of. This video is for true metal animal audiences only. Not recommended for losers, wimps, posers and all other assorted assholes.\n\nThis warning on the back of the DVD is absolutely true. All these elements are present in \n\"Hell on Earth\". At some points, this video seems to be turning into a \"Girls Gone Wild\" film. Of course, there is always an endless supply of alcohol flowing around the band members. It doesn't matter if it's in Brazil, the United States, Belgium or Germany. Manowar is always having a good time.\n\nThis video chronicles the Hell on Wheels tour and captures everything. It documents the arrival of Karl Logan, the making of the orchestral version of \"Courage\" and the making of the \"Return of the Warlord\" video. Also found on \"Hell on Earth\" is a New Years eve celebration is Cleveland, a trip to a bull fight in Spain and a hilarious making of for a cheesy commercial. \n\nAlright, now the music. \"Hell on Earth\" is more of a documentary or a rockumentary then its sequels but there are still great performances of classic Manowar songs. \"Manowar\" is the opening song on this video and it is played very well. The participation of the crowd is beautiful. There is also a strong performance of \"Courage\" live in Portugal. This is very good song and it is played well. We also have performances of \"Kill with Power\"and \"Hail and Kill\". These songs are classics and are played in Godly fashion. \n\nIn conclusion, this DVD is essential to all fans of the metal kings. This video, although more of a documentary still has great performances of classic songs like \"Kings of Metal\" (found in the bonus material section) and \"Spirit Horse of the Cherokee\". Not only are the songs brilliant but the journey to the fourteen countries included on this video is pure genius. The viewer gets to follow Manowar around the Gods of Metal festival in Milan as well as the first visit to South America. All and all this a superb video that is not recommended to wimps and posers.\n",
        "\nManowar take hours of footage of their world tours, a whole concert which kicks ass, a collection of hilarious videos (gloves of metal is particularly side splitting) interviews with the band, backstage footage, interviews with their crew, numerous documentaries and \"making of\"s, shitloads of other bonus material, lump them together across two discs of steel, wrap it up in Ken Kellys trademark artwork and sell it.\nGenius.\nPure Genius.\nIf ever you asked yourself \"Manowars songwriting is hilarious - how can they take themselves seriously?\" this DVD answers your question. They don't. If I were to adhere to the current obsession with categorising everything, I would sell this DVD under \"Comedy/Metal/Soft Porn\", possibly with the slogan \"Its got tits! Its got laughs! Its got thinly veiled homoeroticism and loud music!!!\" here is a band who know how to have a laugh, and thank god. I personally find black/death metal bands who do take themselves seriously the most hilarious of all. To them I say: you're not big or clever, you're just growling and wearing make up. Kiss did that already. Manowar have fun, and they genuinely care about their fans, and they also happen to make damn good music.\n\nRingfest Highlights - Kings Of Metal - Stripped down, sped up, and imbued with enough asskicking power to make generic power metal acts cry for their mothers. Kings has obvious crowd participation potential and Manowar thoroughly exploit. The audience are really into the song and the whole atmosphere is great. Manowar Kill!!\nWarriors Of The World - Again, faster than the record version, and it works a whole lot better for it, with Scott doing some variation of the drums occasionally; a breath of fresh air as the drumming on the record is mind numbingly tedious. Look out for the guy in the front row during the cheesy interlude \"All who stand in my way, will die\". Needless to say, an instant legend.\nBlack Wind, Fire and Steel - What happened here??? I wasn't impressed by the original version (Appearing as the closer on Fighting The World) but this kills! Even faster than the original, and with some fucking evil singing by Eric, the last verse in particular shows he can still kick ass. Even though the line \"Every shore\" in Manowar is ridiculously bad, sounds like \"Avery Chaw!\" and showcases Erics award winning Donald Duck impression. Whoops. \nBut apart from that, yes yes yes. Manowar are a band who have never matured, never changed their style, never turned down (\\m/) and never delivered anything except kick ass, cheesy, occasionally epic power metal. Hail.\n",
        "\nAfter blindly buying their last album \"Warriors of the World\" I was kind of disappointed with the band, and when they announced a new single with two new tracks I couldn't help but download it first in order not to buy another cheesy disc from my fave band. \n\nRight after downloading it I was already wearing my leather jacket and leaving home with 10\u20ac in my wallet that wouldn't come back with me. \n\nTHE SINGLE ACTUALLY KICKED MY ASS!!! Yes, it did it even through two crappy computer speakers. The opening theme \"THE DAWN OF BATTLE\" starts ripping with a long riff and some drums that are telling you \"HELLO SIR! WE ARE MANOWAR AND WE CAME TO BLOW YOUR HEAD\". And they do it all along the song, except for a small cool-down part in the middle which I don't like at all, but it's not enough to lower the score i give to this song. \n\n\"They are back, they are back.... \" I was sort of mentally saying to myself when the second track arrived. \"I BELIEVE\" doesn't start with the savage drum pounding and killer riff as the first track does, instead it's a well done power ballad with strong lyric base and a catchy chorus. Cool enough and no violin/orchestra/crap in the whole song, that's what MANOWAR must play when it comes to slow songs!\n\nFinally I met up with an old friend of mine, the opener track of WOTW (and IMHO one of the best themes) is closing the CD now. And it works as well as it worked as an opener track, pure mid-tempo Heavy Metal with a good facture is always welcome. \n\nOverall: A ripping-off opener, a classy power ballad and a mid tempo epic theme were worth my money, specially considering that I won't find them elsewhere in the whole discography.\n",
        "\nManowar's debut album, entitled Battle Hymns was first released in 1982, and is easily my favourite Manowar album. It's simple, everything on it works, and it's fucking good fun. Manowar's songwriting is questionable at times but on this album the lyrics work just fine, with tolerable levels of cheesiness.\n\nDeath Tone - The first song on the album, after some rather funky motorbike sound effects the guitars kick in, and we are introduced to Manowar. This song is fun, lighthearted and almost tongue in cheek. The lyrics are typical ass-kicking Manowar fare \"I give some square the finger, now he won't look again\". It is interesting to see the reference to the vietnam war, and the message of the song basically is, while all the pussies stayed at home, Manowar went to fight. Also, the solo on this song really fits with the atmosphere, unlike some Manowar songs where I get the impression the solo has just been taped on for the sake of it.\n\nMetal Daze - This song IMO is pure pop, there is nothing about this song that would stop it being a major mainstream success. The lyrical content here is more consistent with later Manowar songs; Heavy metal, loud as it can be. It has to be said, as I listen to this song, it has a truly great concert which instantly screams \"audience participation\", and after watching Manowar's performance of the song at Blood in Brazil, it becomes obvious this is the songs strength; 30,000 metalheads screaming \"Heavy metal\" is something that really has to be heard.\n\nFast Taker - After the mid tempo of the first two songs, Fast Taker comes as a welcome fast number. It is not as memorable perhaps as the first two, but still features some great riffage and basswork. Lyrical content is similar to Death Tone, the basic message is, Manowar do what they want.\n\nShell Shock - Again, a song about the Vietnam war. After Fast Taker sped things up, Shell Shock slows them down again. This is perhaps the weakest song on the album (Not counting William's Tale) but still good fun and much better to some of the songs on Manowar's other albums.\n\nManowar - Ah, this is more like it. As a song named after the band, it does exactly what you would expect it to do - tell the listener a bit about the band, and it does just this. The verses talk about how the band met, and how they decided they were going to play, and the chorus \"Manowar, born to live forever\" is basically a message to all that Manowar has arrived on the scene and are here to stay, an accurate prediction, cos they're making another album right now. Another of my favourite parts of this song is the ending. Long and self-indulgent. Heavy fucking metal.\n\nDark Avenger - The album is definitely picking up here, with this doomy gloomy epic, hinting perhaps at the direction the band were going to take on widely acclaimed follow up Into Glory Ride. The first section tells the story of a man committing some sort of crime against his leaders, and being left to die. At about 2:36 the song changes completely, and the narration of legendary actor Orson Welles kicks in. Listeners at this point may well be wondering, \"What the fuck is Orson Welles doing on a Manowar album???\" well to answer the question, in Manowar's early days, they were admired by Orson, as their struggle to find fame apparently mirrorred his own and he identified with them because of this. Anyway, after a grim minute of narration, the typical cheesiness given an uncharacteristic gravity thanks to Welles, the song truly kicks in. After the line \"The pounding of his hooves, did clap, like thunder\" Eric Adams launches into the best scream he has ever done in his career. The last, fast section of the song describes the Dark Avenger himself taking revenge upon the society which cast him out. And as many others will tell you, it fucking owns. \"In blood I take my payment, in full, with their lives\" oh fucking yes. I love the momentum on this song, despite being an epic, it never drags for a second and I love the way the slow first section acts as a counterpoint to the kickass riffage of the last. A true Manowar classic...\n\nWilliam's Tale - ...and then they go and ruin their momentum with this 1:54 wankfest. I'm told it's some sort of classical piece played on a bass, however there is nothing about this that does not cry out \"Skip button\". I have never understood why Manowar do this on almost every album, but ah well, I suppose you've gotta take the rough with the smooth. Warlord should be here instead of this, it didn't fit on IGR and William's Tale is just pointless. Thankfully...\n\nBattle Hymn - The greatest Manowar song of all time is next. Battle Hymn is Manowar's most powerful, most epic, and most inspiring masterpiece to date. After an introduction which sends shivers down my spine, Donny Hamzik's drum fill leads into a glorious slow galloping riff. The lyrics are Manowar. That's the only way to describe them. Eric Adams gives a sublime vocal performance on this song, for instance I love the way he sticks to the music in the first verse, and in the second verse bends his notes and throws his voice around more; the song seems to gain more momentum every second. This peaks with the second chorus \"Victory! Victory!\" after which we see the first in a very, very long history of Manowar habits - the cheesy interlude. However, I must admit I actually quite enjoy this one. Given the light hearted nature of most of the previous songs this particular interlude just makes me laugh. The lyrics are silly, very silly, but it never drags. After another drum fill from Hamzik, the song kicks off again with another scream from Adams, then it's back to \"Kill! Kill!\" before the final verse is sung a full octave higher by Adams. His voice here is fucking amazing, unlike power metal singers with clean eunuch screams he howls with attitude and just fucking owns almost every other singer out there. The song, and subsequently the album, ends with a trademark massive ending, which just fits perfectly.\n\n\nIn conclusion - Manowar's best album. IGR might be more epic, Hail to england might be heavier, but everything on this album is true fucking quality. The songwriting is never forced or too cheesy, the songs themselves are solid, the synergy between the musicians is just fine, the production is balls but hey this is 1982, and it's got fucking Orson Welles on it!! Kill!\n",
        "\nA great choice of single, and a great choice of B-sides. Ok, what have we got?\n\nThe Dawn Of Battle - Fucking great song, heavy fast paced start, a great interlude with some truly excellent vox from Adams \"I will live agaaaaaaaain\" before the song gradually ends in the same way it began. Solid work.\n\nI Believe - A great ballad, ok so its no Heart Of Steel, but with an anthemic chorus and rousing lyrics and a sweet solo, that is perhaps just a little short but still quality.\n\nCall To Arms - The opener from WOTW, another strong, fast paced heavy one, perhaps a little similar to The Dawn Of Battle but a great song nonetheless.\n",
        "\nThis is the best Manowar album to date. It\u2019s as if these metal kings went on a diet and dropped the fat. Before there were really good works like Kings of Metal, which almost intentionally fucks itself over with the spoken track, and don\u2019t ask me why they did it. Review title taken from \u201cNumber 1\u201d lyrics sums it up \u2013 this time they mean it. \n\nThe strength of this album is that its straight forward, catchy, has balls and anthemic. The lyrics deal with being true to metal and the life of metalheads that live free, ride hard and die young. Eric Adams hammers out vocal lines with conviction. The bass is prominent, the sound is thick, the pace is mostly mid-paced to fast. Remember \u201cHail and Kill\u201d? If Manowar had it playing in the background while writing this album, I would not be surprised. One song \u201cOutlaw\u201d is particularly similar to that in its over-the-top bloodlust-infusing energy. \u201cKing\u201d starts as a ballad as good as \u201cHeart of Steel\u201d and sounds similar, then midway it becomes an anthem with shout-along chorus. \n\nAs far as pure metal anthems, you know what you are getting with Manowar \u2013 an abundance of them. The opening three tracks are the 1-2-3 punch of the album. \u201cThe Gods Made Heavy Metal\u201d being most memorable, it is a simple composition with galloping bass line and effective riff work. Then comes the solo, which is short and cuts away any remaining fat imagery that may have been left over from previous album experiences. God bless short solos, the same Gods that made heavy metal intended metal to feel like a 3-minute boxing round, not a marathon. Then at the end, Adams just rips his lungs inside out. An anthem worthy of the title. \n\nIf you are looking for music to work out to, or to run over some people to (don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you) this will do great.\n",
        "\nAs everyone else already said, the album is divided into two parts, the five first songs and the the three last.\n\nThe first part is typical metal ranging from decent (Manowar) to good (Metal Daze), the songs Death Tone, Fast Taker and Shell Shock are okay but certainly nothing special. The lyrics to these songs are decent (few bands have good lyrics), the riffs are good and the vocals are great. The songs are too similar in structure though, it wouldn't have heart if there been a slower song among those, or anything that would have given a bit more variation. Well, these songs aren't the reason I listen to this album.\n\nThe last three tracks are superb on the other hand. Well, William's Tale isn't quite a song, it's a bass solo showing the bassist's perfected skills. Much better than Metallica's (Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth. And it fits in perfectly between the songs Dark Avenger and Battle Hymn, which are among the best Epic Metal songs ever written.\nDark Avenger consists of three parts, it starts slowly, the first part wouldn't be misplaced in a Doom Metal album. Second part is the narration by Orson Wells, it fits in perfectly. And the last part is the faster part with great riffs and a superb vocal performance. And I haven't even mentioned the vocals. An epic classic!\nBattle Hymn, this is a musical orgasm, the epitome of Epic Metal: perfect guitar intro, superb vocals, awesome slow middle part and killing lyrics. The created atmosphere is immense. Manowar's best song and one of the best songs ever!\n\nThe high score is mostly based on the three last tracks, those tracks are the reason I bought this album. The score would've been higher if there had been more epic tracks. One of the best debuts ever. With this record Manowar into glory rode.\n",
        "\nRight, okey, this is Manowar, which usually indicates we're in for a bumpy ride. Or at least I am, there seem to be overwhelming amounts of reviews by those who have been taken over by their evil spell and are positively ejaculating over the band whilst typing their reviews. Therefore making the keys \"s\", \"u\", \"c\" and \"k\" so stuck down that it is practically impossible for them to actually tell the truth concerning the band... \n\n...I jest (in part), for Manowar can really pull it off to almost perfection at times, and this album certainly does have its strong moments. Eric Adams is again wailing his battle cries out with pride and passion, which is something I can't fault him for really. He still has a unique set of pipes which don't really bring to mind anybody else and are instantly identifiable. This album also gives Ross the Boss the chance to indulge more and lead guitar is given a better workout than on the previous album of the same year, Hail to England. While that album has more of a firmly consistent feel to it, opting for the straight up headbanging anthems, this one jumps around and tries to pull off more epic atmospheric pieces, and occassionally the riffs seem get lost in the mix. The title track is a good example of the effects of that, while a decent song, it's not a match for the mighty pillars to each side of it. The first two songs are really the throwaway ones for me, though while \"All Men Play on Ten\" has its sing-a-long vibe and a monster of a chorus, it isn't one of Manowar's best odes to the greatness of metal, Kings of Metal far surpasses it. \"Animals\" is a dirty rocker that seems to fail to make much of an impression despite some attempt to get back my attention with a blistering solo. \n\nThen with \"Thor (The Powerhead)\" things really get cooking and we get a majestic, over the top song that I would think of what Manowar should be doing. But sadly, what this band is capable of and what they actually turn out with are two entirely different things, which is why I'm not crazily headbanging along to every second of this disc! But \"Mountains\" comes in and continues on the quality of the last track, but tries to build up the mood to boiling point. There's plenty going on here, but the heavy headbanging riffs are a bit scarcer and the atmospheric clean guitars and bass lead it on for most of the way. But it definitely creates that great sense of power and all the pieces fit well together. I defy anyone not to raise their fist proudly when Eric screams out \"I have no fear!!!\" Now moving past the already examined title track which kind of seems to work but the production makes the riffs disappear a bit, and onto another winner \"The Oath\". This is basically back to the anthemic Manowar of \"Thor...\", music to ride into battle by, with some incredibly untamed leads topped all off with in fine style with another bombastic chorus. These songs aren't necessarily the greatest heavy metal has to offer, but they are nice to hear from the often inconsistent Manowar, and are solidly written and played with buckets full of passion and conviction. Which is what I can give these songs the most credit for, even if they are lacking in some departments.\n\nBlah, in we come with the most pointless bit of the album, the obligatory bass solo. \"Thunderpick\" is another three minutes of bass wankery, which is probably wholey unnecessary with zero direction. Skip it, because the best bit is yet to come. Guyana (Cult of the Damned) basically takes all the better ideas from the album and sticks them all together to make up the album's second \"big epic\". Starting off with the clean and acoustic guitars along with the bass leading onwards with a more subdued less pronounced and over the top way than usual. It then as is expected explodes into the album's best riffs and sense of where it's going. Although I think the chorus is overplayed a bit, it still does a good job of humbling pretty much all the other songs here. While this is no Hail to England, they still get things right enough to warrant some good amount of interest and will be another good slab of Manowar for fans of the band. Unfortunately containing some definite throwaways and a bit of a weak and at other times odd production that holds it down.\n",
        "\nThere is only one flaw in this album - it's too damn short! But the short period of musical greatness is one of metal finest hours! Every song here rules quite a lot, and the whole thing is an intense dark screaming piece of heavy metal.\n\nIt begins with five songs which just seem to go along extremely well together. It's impossible to say which of them is the best, but it would probably be the screaming fast Kill With Power or the dark atmospheric Each Dawn I Die. They all have a strong clear yet very deep sound, with a touch of darkness, and with Hail to England being the lightest track with an enjoyable fast pace and perhaps the best solo on the album. Blood of My Enemies is a great opener, dragging you slowly yet fiercely into the album before it decends into the heavier Each Dawn I Die. The fifth track, which closes the main sequence of five track, is a song dedicated to all of Manowar's fans and is even named after their fan club. It is a great rocking song with very powerful riffage and beat. After that comes a bass solo, with a cool intro speech, which features Joey's extraordinary bass-playing skills, but is a bit, well, blurred. It devides the album into it's two parts, the opening five tracks and the final epic masterpiece, which alone is enough to balance the album. It is one of Manowar's darkest, most epic songs, with great vocals and an exellent flow. It closes the album perfectly with Eric's evil laughter, making this one of the finest metal albums ever to be released.\n\nIf you don't have this yet, buy it, it is a classic masterpiece.\nHighlights:all of the songs.\nDownfalls:none.\n",
        "\ncan't exactly put my finger on it, but something in this album just doesn't work. I'm not sure what they did wrong, there's some sollid drumming here, good bass riffage, nice soloing, and Eric delivers some of his greatest screams... I think that's why I don't like this album; it all combines into that great Manowar sound - it IS Manowar - but something about the songwriting doesn't fit. All in all it's a decent album, but it's nothing compared to some of Manowar's other releases. \n\nIt opens with the title track, whish is a nice rockin' song, but there's nothing really special about it. It's just there and you hear it when you get there. The same more or less goes to the second song, Blow Your Speakers. I guess what saves this song is Eric's superb screaming, but it's still nothing very noticeable. Carry On is perhaps one of the finest points in the album, and it has a bit more of a point in it's existence, what with the build-up and relative variety in the song'd progress. Next comes a good speedy song, one of the tracks in the album. It is more powerful than Fighting The World and has the fastest pace in the album. Defender is the next song, which is actually quite an interesting track in which Eric sings alongside Orson Wells in the chorus, and it is a done well, just not very well.The next song, Drums of Doom, is just a small intro to Holy War, which doesn't really need any intro.It's a decent song with nice vocals, but still nothing special. Then comes Master of Revenge, which I don't think really justifies it's existence. Not much to say about this one. Then the final track lifts things up a little bit, and when Eric screams the final verse it really is quite nice, more emotion is found here than on most other tracks, but unfortunatly it still suits the album's overall weak atmosphere. \n\nI guess the problem here is mostly that the album doesn\"t really go anywhere, and it lacks the emotion, power and perhaps a bit epicness found on other Manowar albums. Just an average album, which is disapointing from Manowar.\n",
        "\nI don't care what people say, this album rules. I admit, it does fuck itself up with some of Manowar's weaker songs, but even when it does it doesn't do it so badly, and the highlights are certainly more than enough to make up for it. \n\nThe album begins with a very powerful and intense ass-kicking Manowar classic, Call to Arms. This songs just grabs you and sends you strait into the album before you know what hit you. At last you get a chance to breath in a bit with a slower and decent ballad, Fight For Freedom. Nice build-up, nice chorus, nice solo, a nice song. From there you can really relax with Nessun Dorma, though it is one of the weaker songs, it features some extraordinary vocals from Eric and is still quite enjoyable. Then you get a hint of heaviness with a 34-second-long instrumental part, which is good enough I suppose, but perhaps a tad short. Anyway, it serves as a great opening intro to the masterpiece of the album, Swords In The Wind. This is probably the best song I've ever encountered. It starts off slow, with Eric singing about his end and so on, and just builds-up. And builds-up. And explodes. And builds-up. This song is an amazing continual creshendo (And I love creshendos), simply getting more and more powerful until it's suddenly gone. I've probably heard it hundreds of times, but it's still beautiful every time I hear it. \nThe next song, An Amarican Trilogy, is probably the weakest point in the album. I suppose that all in all it's a decent cover, but all it really does is lowers the album's momentum for a few moments. The next song is another instrumental, a little longer this time. It's quite a good orchestral part, though again it seems to just build the album up towards the final asult. But this time even prebuilding-up is needed, since right after that come almost 20 minutes of non-stop pure kick-ass metal, one of Manowar's finest hours. The next four songs are all among Manowar's greatest, each of them followed by an even stronger and faster song, until the final \"WHOA!\" in Fight Until We Die leave you suddenly lacking something in your life and hungry for more fucking ownage delivered by the kings of metal. Truly a masterpiece.\n",
        "\nThis is what Manowar should sound like. Singing about Metal in every single song may get a bit repetitive, no matter how good the songs are. Battle Hymn still holds true to the \u201cHeavy Metal or no Metal at all\u201d tradition of Manowar, but it also offers exciting songs that don\u2019t necessarily deal with Metal. \u201cDeath Tone,\u201d which is a song about going to war while the other pussy hippies stay at home, is a great representation of what Manowar started of as, and should have stayed throughout their careers. Fun, stimulating, sing-along-to are all examples of the greatness that is this album.\n\n\u201cMetal Daze,\u201d the song that probably everyone knows, and sounds likes the self-proclaimed Metal anthem, is one of the best songs on the album. Singing \u201cHeavy Metal, Metal Daze, Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal Daaaaazze\u201d over and over again send chills of electrifying power through your body, sort of speak. This is a very fun album, which does not contain as much of the \u201ccheese\u201d factor as the later Manowar albums have.\n\nSongs like \u201cFast Taker,\u201d \u201cDeath Tone\u201d and \u201cShell Shock\u201d are all fast-bang-your-head-to-tracks that are not about the glory of Metal, which, in all honesty, is a good thing. These alterations in a Manowar album are welcome changes that only improve the quality of the album. This first album by Manowar has a much higher replay value than the albums that would follow because of the three songs that I have mentioned. Sure, singing about Metal is great, and it\u2019s awesome to sing along to, but it shouldn\u2019t be overdone. \n\nThe song \u201cManowar\u201d is a bit weaker compared to the other tracks. It still is well written, and offers a similar punch as the other tracks, but I expected a tad more from a song titled after the band. No big deal, as it does add variation to the album, and is well positioned in the track listing. The track that follows is the epic song \u201cDark Avenger\u201d with narration by non other than the great Orson Wells. A great story of Greek mythology, I believe, tells of a dark avenger, that stands against the elders and rebels. The song begins with singing vocals, with simple melody in the background. At about two minutes and 30 seconds Orson Wells narrates the story, which is the introduction to the exhilarating-bang-your-fucking-head-to-throw-the-horns-rape-the-daughters-and-the-wives part of the song.\n\n\u201cBurning, death, destruction raping the daughters and wives \nIn blood I take my payment in full with their lives .\u201d\n\nLyrics that are very memorable, and music that makes your ear drums bleed. Great guitar and drum work and amazing vocals that kill posers without even trying.\n\n\u201cWilliam\u2019s Tale,\u201d is the track that most other Manowar albums have. It\u2019s the track that doesn\u2019t really belong there and should have been deleted. Of course it\u2019s not \u201cNassun Dorma\u201d of Warriors of the World, because it is much better than that. \u201cWilliam\u2019s Tale\u201d is basically a guitar instrumental rendition of the famous melody. It is very well played, therefore I can\u2019t complain that much, as it is certainly not another \u201cNassun Dorma\u201d but it still isn\u2019t up to par with the rest of the album.\n\nThe last track, which is also the title track, is a familiar song to the later Manowar songs. It is basically a \u201cWe\u2019re all united and fighting for Metal\u201d type of song. It may be a bit cheesy but it does have great sing-along-to lyrics and therefore is a great finish to a great album. The instrumental parts, even the simple guitar parts at the beginning are all exceptional. Not so much in technicality, but in composition style and overall fitting melody to the \u201cMetal anthem.\u201d This song is one of the highlights of the album, and well deserving the praise. Manowar will later be known for such songs, but surely not in this caliber. \u201cBattle Hymn\u201d is a most excellent ending to one of the greatest Manowar albums.\n\nManowar is known for their \u201ccheesy\u201d songs, but make no mistake, Battle Hymn is not the album that gave people that impression. Filled with amazingly fun and headbanging songs, Battle Hymn should be in every Manowar fan\u2019s collection. Others, who don\u2019t necessarily like Manowar should also give this a well deserved listen, as it is not your typical Manowar album.\n",
        "\nThe first thing I though after listening to the first few notes of this album was: 'Where have the riffs gone?' As they seem to have disappeared into a mess of fuzzy distortion, which is a huge shame, as the last album had great riffs. You could tell they would've been great on here, if it wasn't for the huge mess they did.\n\nThe vocals are still great, especially the scream at the beginning of Animals, but they seem to sound strangely hollow, and still don't really fit into any of the songs.\n\nThe solos are definately more impressive than ever, being major wank-fests most of the time, but really fitting the songs. By the time you get to Mountains, the riffs seem to have pulled out of their fuzzy sound, and become more clear. You can't really tell on this song, though, as it's a clean ballad, with barely any riffs at all.\n\nBut, just when you though all was good, Sign Of The Hammer gets drowned in total fuzz, apart from the solo which rockets above the song. Manowar can't seem to make any fully consistent albums.\n\nThunder Pick is another amazing bass solo, showing off the skill of the band members. They really don't need to do this anymore, as it was done enough across the first three albums. Guyana is another epic album ender, but it's the best I've heard from Manowar. A bass heavy introduction leads into one of Manowar's best songs, and some of the best vocals on any Manowar album.\n",
        "\nAt last, a Manowar album where the riffs are clear-as-day! They definately stand out, despite being ever-so distorted. Also, this is the first album where the drums really sound well done on accompanying the guitar.\n\nThe vocals and lyrics are still as big and cheesy as ever, but by now it's what you should've come to expect. The bass stands out a lot more on this album, not being just a distorted metallic noise, like on the previous two albums.\n\nThe solos on here are excellent, and feature better playing than the first two albums, but the riffs on some songs are really quite disappointing. The stand-out track is the title track, as it is catchy as Hell. You could almost imagine barbarians marching on their way to English lands singing the chorus to this song, ready for war.\n\nBlack Arrows has a fucking strange introduction clip, with the strangest scream I've ever heard, and then a strange but amazing guitar solo. The entire song shows off the pure skill of his playing, but is slightly let down by being distorted still.\n\nThe last song is the typical Manowar epic finisher, and does its job just fine, but isn't really that impressive. Nice riffs and a great solo, though.\n\nManowar did a good job here, they finally got everything present, but it's a shame about some of the songs they played, otherwise it could've been so much better.\n",
        "\nThis album kicks off with a very interesting sound-clip, and then bursts into Warlord. A high-speed adrenaline rush of a song. Never giving in, constantly running along, accompanied by a solo of high-speed playing, and then fades away. It could've been better if they extended it a bit.\n\nAfter this comes the first epic sounding song on this album, and slowly builds up, but never really grows anywhere and stays quite slow. The next song is a disappointment after the first two songs, as it just seems to wallow on the album, never really doing anything special. It's the only incosistent part of this album.\n\nGates Of Valhalla is the typical epic Manowar ballad song, progressing for an entire seven minutes, never ceasing to amaze the listener, with its constant riffing and occasional solo. Hatred is another epic Manowar song, but it has a very evil sound to it, as you could understand. There is sections in this song where the music stops and keyboards ring out, and you think a solo is about to punch out, but never does. A little disappointing.\n\nRevalation is a song that gallops along on its own speed, being nothing amazing. The solo is rather good though, ranging from really fast, to uber-high notes wavering around. The last song is another slow starter, and sounds very similar to the previous song, which is a shame.\n\nOverall, on this album Manowar have improved slightly, but they still haven't got anywhere musically compared to their previous album. The guitars are now more prominant than the first, it's just a shame they aren't put to great use.\n",
        "\nSay what you will about the metal in-joke that Manowar have become but this first record is a classic slab of tough-guy rock and roll that without the image and tacky interview bits should stand alone as a benefit to heavy metal. The production is a little lame (though much better on the re-master), but who can deny such talented riffcraft and emotional vocalizing? (This is before Eric Adams became a parody of the genre entirely you know...) Not I, sayeth the Von.\n\nSongs like \"Death Tone\", \"Battle Hymn\" and and \"Metal Daze\" all stomp and claw with a rock and roll menace all of thier own. The riffs rule, the vocals are passionate and if you ignore the lyrics this stands out as much as any important early-1980's heavy metal record. \"I WENT TO THE BIG HOUSE YOU JUST WORK A JOB!!!!!!\" Yep...sing it Erik. I am hardly traditional Manowarrior though...as I think the song \"Dark Avenger\" kinda sucks...but when these boys rock out...they ROCK OUT.\n\n\"Battle Hymns\" is a classic release for ANY band and Manowar did the right thing at the right time in writing/releasing this music to the world. Say what you will about the band now, but on their first four cheesy-yet-brilliant records these guys actually WERE the \"kings of metal\" in their own inconceivable way.\n\n\"Hail & Kill\" ya silly bastards.\n\nhttp://www.manowar.com\n",
        "\nThis was the first Manowar album I ever bought (on vinyl, I still have it, on 10 Records, a subsidiary of Virgin at the time), after hearing \"Thor, The Powerhead\" on my fave college radio metal show. And this still holds a powerful amount of sentimental value for me. The production is clear and powerful, and all parties put on their customary excellent performances--I think that \"Thunderpick\" is one of Joey's best recorded solos and I love how smoothly it segues into \"Guyana, Cult of the Damned\" without a hitch. \n\n\"Thor, The Powerhead\" is one of the all time best Manowar tunes for me, with its dramatic verses, anthemic chorus, and that devastating, noisy ending with Eric holding that incredible high scream for over a minute (!!!), and I like how the emotional \"Mountains\" is dedicated to Joey's late father, in a rare show of sensitivity for him. The rest of the album is outstanding as well, especially \"Guyana, Cult of the Damned\" about the Jim Jones religious cult and Eric's chililng screams of \"MOTHER! MOTHER!! MOTHERRRRRR!!!!!\" at the end will make your hair stand on end. A thundering anthem that is one of their best, in my book along with \"Thor...\", this one is. \n\nIf you are getting into Manowar, you need this album. Along with \"Hail to England\", \"Kings of Metal\", and \"Triumph of Steel\", it is one of their very best opuses.\n",
        "\nI can see why some of the more impatient sorts out there got bored with \"Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy in 8 Parts\", but it makes a great album starter in my opinion. It features everything that makes Manowar great: outstanding vocals ranging from clean to scream from Eric Adams, jaw-dropping musicianship, blisteringly heavy riffing and dynamics to the max, it's all good here. Rhino earns his nickname with an amazing drum solo that builds from quiet cymbal tickling to full-on double kick massacre and an amazing ambient drum sound that took some getting used to, as I thought he was triggered at first. Joey, naturally, gets his solo space and impresses as always, as does David Shankle, a more technically advanced player than Ross, if not with quite as much character as Ross had. I actually really like this piece, and it took guts for Manowar to do what their muse called them to do. They have my respect anyway, and this tune cements that.\n\nThe rest of the album follows suit with a series of the usual metal anthems they are best at, like \"Metal Warriors (Brothers of Metal Pt. II)\", fantasy-based lyrics like \"Ride The Dragon\" (AWESOME bass work in this, including what I am certain is the only instance of a bassist using a talk box in the intro and ending for a chilling series of dragon roars and snarls) and \"The Demon's Whip\", more diversified lyrical content like \"Spirit Horse of the Cherokee\" (another nice intro with American Indian language dialogue over Eric's menacing spoken word part, and you gotta admire a white guy like Joey writing pro-Indian lyrics and respecting them as the strong fighters that they were), and \"Master of the Wind\" ends things with an emotional appeal to follow your dreams as only they can pen. I give Manowar credit for always trying to give their fans a positive message in some of their songs, and this is one of the reasons I respect them as I do. I really like this album, and I wish people would give it more of a chance.\n",
        "\nUltraboris pretty much nailed this band when he said they were inconsistent. So far, the only Manowar album I've heard that I've appreciated and felt moved by all the way through was \"Hail to England\". Apparently, \"Sign of the hammer\" was recorded at around the same time as that other album, and, though it's not nearly universally brilliant, offers a few pretty good stompers and epics. I am afraid that what we might have hear is \"Load/Reload\" syndrome, in that these perhaps were songs that didn't quite make the cut of the original album, but I don't know enough about Manowar's history to say whether this is true. Certainly this album lacks the true anthemic classics that \"Hail to England\" has got, with the notable acception of \"Thor: The Powerhead\", but there are at least four great songs here, which for Manowar ain't too bad.\n\n\"All Men Play On Ten\" rules. I don't care for some of Manowar's \"heavy metal anthems\", but this is simply the shit. It starts out with a cutting, pounding riff..and the verses give Eric adams full reign to sing about how he'll never turn down low to make money, etc, etc. It's very singable, and catchy, and you'll soon forget your shame and belt out the lyrics along with Mr. Adams. Manowar have stuck to their guns, too, despite how utterly vapid their latest album seems to be. \"Thor\", as previously mentioned, might be the album's highlight\u2026more utterly great vocal melodies and some really nice pounding drum work. \"Mountains\", is a ballad\u2026but a very solid one at that. Eric adams delivers one of his least pretentious and most stirring performances during the verses, and the twanging, scintillating bass effects (for want of a better description) are nicely evocative. Massive, proud chorus too, which everyone should agree is something Manowar does best. \"Guyana (Cult of the Damned) seems to be kind of legendary among fans, but like \"Sign of the Hammer\", I think it's only a decent track. Spot the \"Star Spangled Banner\" melody in this song and win a prize.\nWhat about the overwrought garbage? Oh, that would be a real dud of a song called \"Animals\", with some stupid oversexed lyrics, and no riff to speak of, and a chorus that is lame and repetitive. Then there's \"Thunderpick\", three and a half minutes of bullshit bass wankery courtesey of Joey DeMaio, who must have run out of ideas for classical pieces to mutilate this time, as he seems to be trying to emulate the dead-end noodling that can be found on the first King Crimson album or something. \"The Oath\"?\u2026perfectly forgettable..not despicable but harmless and rather boring. \n\nReally, I think it's Eric adams' vocals that make this album. That, and the true heavy metal attitude, although it still sounds better on \"Hail to England\". If you're a fan of Adams' singing, some of his best is on here, complete with those trademark piercing wail/shrieks that he always manages to make sound exactly the same every time he does them, which is somehow admirable. Now that that's over with, my one question is, why doesn't the band ever play \"Thor (The Powerhead)\" in concert?\n",
        "\nAlright lets get this straight....I consider myself quite a big Manowar fan, and I did have high expectations due to Louder Than Hell being one of the best heavy metal cds of all time. Warriors of the World (released 6 years after LTH) came into my cd player and shocked the piss out of me. I absolutally loved Call to Arms, but then to much dismay i was even more shocked to find \"filler\" on a Manowar album. I understand how some bands like to experiment with other types of music and all, because I am a musician myself, but this SHOULD NOT, be on a Manowar cd. These tracks i speak of are :Nessun Dorma, The American Trilogy, Valhalla, and Fight for Freedom (which is pretty good but nothing special). The thing about all of these aformentioned tracks is that they sound NOTHING like Manowars traits we've come to know and love. I mean Nessun Dorma is a nice song and all with great singing, but this is something you would hear at an Opera Hall, not on a MANOWAR album. But either way Warriors of the World has plenty of fucking excellent songs that are easily worth the money one would pay to obtain such an album as this. Tracks like Call to Arms, Swords in the Wind, Warriors of the World United, Hand of Doom, and House of Death and are killer songs that are Manowar classics right from the start. \nHalf of this album should not be on here i truely believe, but I do admire what they have done. We Manowar fans are pleased with this release but just skip the filler material next time. I like even the filler stuff but its definatly not their style, and not what most want to hear. They want to hear a new Manowar album and that is all...Steel, Kill all Posers, blah blah blah, these are the things we admire you for writing and singing. No one else does it quite like Manowar. Eric Adams your an amazing vocalist, hell the whole band is impressive. So is most of this album, besides the tracks i will not mention below. Yet again Manowar releases some quality fucking music...Raise your swords men. \nCheers *chugs an ale*\n\nBest tracks: Call to Arms, Swords In The Wind, Warriors Of The World United, Hand Of Doom, House Of Death\n",
        "\nWow, that bass is fucking loud. It's an interesting mix, but not altogether a bad one... also, the songwriting is top-notch, making this one of the Manowar albums worth having. As mentioned in previous reviews, it's pretty uptempo, compared to the slow and crushing Into Glory Ride - this one is more of another Battle Hymns, except cheesy in a different way. Instead of the completely over-the-top late-70s style Death Tone, we have songs like Army of the Immortals, which is the companion piece to Manowar from the first LP. \n\nThe vocals aren't quite so loud in the mix as on Battle Hymns, but the riffage is similar. So is the album structure: there's a bass solo, and the last song is by far the most epic. There is only one epic number, though - not two. Oh well. It's also sort of completely over-the-top in cheese factor.\n\nAnyway, the overall quality... the first five songs are all top-notch headbangers. Each is around 4 minutes in length, and each is epic and tr00 without tripping over itself in pretentiousness. This is the simple, effective Manowar that they are very good at, more so than the epic stuff, which is up and down. You can't lose, though, with a bash-it-out number like Kill with Power or Call to Arms or Return of the Warlord or Fast Taker or Hail and Kill, etcetc. \n\nAll 5 songs are excellent... the highlight is probably the aforementioned Army of the Immortals, or perhaps the opener Blood of my Enemies.\n\nWhat of the last two songs, then? Well, there's the bass solo. \"Let each note I play be...\" some pretentious bullshit. At least it's not 12 minutes long like a certain bootleg I've heard from '84. Yeek.\n\nThen, the last track. Manowar goes Black Metal? Not really... a decent song, in the middle of the pack of the 'epic numbers that work' by Manowar. Pretty much something they haven't been able to do since the first four albums, but when they were good at it, oh they were very good. The opener is a balladic part, sort of reminiscent of Heart of Steel, before it explodes into something that would make Black Sabbath proud. It is, however, a bit overlong... the last three minutes or so are completely forgettable, though it probably more than anything else inspired the middle section of Victim of Fate. Still, really fucking silly. \"Drink my blood, as I drink yours.\" Does Satan even have blood? A question for the theologists, I presume.\n\nIn any case... older Manowar is far less a self-parody than new Manowar. This is a recommended album to get, for both those that have heard other shit by them, and those that need an intro to the band.\n",
        "\nWhile not a bad album in it's own right, Fighting the World is one of the weakest Manowar efforts, and does seem rather pale when compared to the first four albums.\nThis album in many ways takes a more rock n' roll-ish direction. The production is much cleaner, lower and lighter, the songs are very accessible and are constructed rather simply, and the drumbeats are pretty standard and not very interesting.\nThough it does take a turning point through about half of the album, and gets back to more epic, speed metal oriented material.\nAs I already stated, Fighting the World is one of Manowar's weakest releases (the second weakest in fact. The very weakest then being Louder Than Hell), but it is pretty decent, and contains some really catchy riffwork and singalong choruses. The title track and Blow Your Speakers are excellent examples of this, and do a pretty good job opening up the album, although the weak production and lack of real punch to take alot away from them.\nThe next three are pretty average. Carry On is upbeat and incredibly catchy, yet also hideously cheesy, and probably the most accessible song found here. Violence and Bloodshed is the lowest point of the album, with boring single-note riffs like those found on Louder Than Hell, only with worse production and boring, forgettable vocal lines. Defender starts out fairly atmospheric, but then just plods along with the chorus being repeated a bunch of times, and it really never gets anywhere.\nBut for the last 2 songs, something happens. Holy War fuckin owns- Atmospheric, epic and absolutely devastating, this goes on at a fast pace with tastefully done single-note basslines underneath powerful vocals and atmospheric keyboard effects in the background, with nice riffwork kicking in for the chorus. And believe it or not, the final track is even better.\nWe kick into the first vers right from the start. Right away, Joey knocks you over with an insane bass assault. Underneath, Scott hammers the double bass in a galloping rhythm and Eric sings the fast and atmospheric vocal lines, before it all explodes in the chorus. BORN OF BLACK WIND, FIRE AND STEEL!\nComplete and utter fucking ownage- and it gets better. The mental guitar solo takes us into the final vers, which is sung by a completely menacing Eric Adams in an unreal falsetto. This is one of Manowar's greatest songs ever, definitely.\nThough between these two asskicking songs, we have some really stupid and pointless interludes, detracting from the overall flow and quality of the album. What the hell are they supposed to be?\n\nSo despite two total winners found on here, most of the material is rather average, and comes off as pretty weak compared to the rest of their catalogue. And that is not helped by a lacking production, and thus this ends up as one of the weakest Manowar albums this far. It's not bad, just pretty average.\n",
        "\nAfter the mindblowing debut album Battle Hymns, which remains one of my top five albums ever, and the more epic Into Glory Ride, Manowar brings is their third studio album, titled Hail To England. It was given that title because the American critics completely ignored Manowar in the early days as they were \"too radical\", while the English critics praised them to no end. So the band decided to name the album (one of the songs) Hail To England, as a tribute to the country.\nHail To England takes the epic feeling and raw production of the previous album Into Glory Ride, blends it with the classic heavy metal feeling of debut album Battle Hymns, and ends up being the third amazing album in a row for Manowar.\n\nWe begin with Blood of My Enemies. This song, as well as the entire album takes a while to fully appreciate, but when you do it's fucking killer.\nThe opening basslines are spinechilling, and when Eric kicks the song going along with the heavy-as-hell midpaced main riff, you can't help but getting up to headbang.\nThe chorus is a classic, with atmospheric choirs in the background and a raw but at the same time melodic vocal performance. And the solo is bloody amazing too.\n\nEach Dawn I Die is the album's weakest song (except for the hideous bass solo) but it still rocks quite well. Heavy, slightly above midpaced bass riff over an evil vocal performance complete with weird but mighty cool \"aahAAH\" parts. This is a very good song, but somewhat lacks the intensity and atmosphere displayed in the others.\n\nKill With Power. Fuck yeah, this rocks. The drum intro starts slow, then speeds up, before crashing into in-fucking-sanity. Total speed metal guitar/bass riffwork, explosive drums and a wicked vocal performance, along with Hail And Kill-style chorus: Kill With Power, DIE DIE! Yup, this is as classic as it gets.\n\nNext up we have the title track. The bass- and guitarwork and vocal lines are the standouts on this song. Excellent driving riffwork build a strong spine for the song, and the guitar solo is insane. The vocal lines are catchy and uplifting, and the chorus is singalong based and incredibly powerful.\n\nArmy of the Immortals is Manowar's tribute to their fan club, with the same name. The lyrics stand out here, they are well written and makes me proud to me a Manowar fan. The riffwork is excellent as usual; somewhat simple but very powerful, and works excellent with the vocals.\n\nThe bass solo Black Arrows is, aside from the cool spoken intro, a pile of feces. It's just a blur of random noises, and will make your ears bleed. In a bad way.\n\nThe final song Bridge of Death is a true masterpiece of epic proportions.\nIt starts out as a ballad, with a mesmerizing atmosphere and a beautiful vocal performance, with spinechilling guitar melodies underneath. Then it changes smoothly into a dark and catchy, midpaced bridge while still maintaining the epic atmosphere created in the beginning. It stays at about the same pace, maintains the atmosphere and remains just as dark and evil throughout the entire song, reaching above 7 minutes, and ends up as one of my top 5 Manowar songs of all time.\n\n\nSo, aside from Black Arrows and Each Dawn I Die, this album rocks pretty fucking well. Highlights? All songs except the two I just mentioned.\n",
        "\nThis is certainly a pretty good Manowar album, with a few great songs on here. However, it's not 100% excellent, with a few plodding songs that just don't quite sound right - managing to sound like a bad doom band - a Black Sabbath but without the crushing heaviness.\n\nBut first, the good. Warlord - this is a fun little song. It's the fastest song on here - Hell, it's the only song on here that sounds anywhere near fast. The intro is silly as fuck... but then we get into a solid banging number. This one sounds like a Battle Hymns track - comparable to the first few on that album. The rest of the album is completely different.\n\nGloves of Metal is a solid riff-based epic number. The intro riff and then onwards, this just fucking crushes. This is epic heavy fucking metal the way it is designed to be - something that Manowar would try to get to on albums like The Triumph of Steel, but then just never quite do. It's a midpaced crusher of a song with some solid headbanging riffage.\n\nThen, Gates of Valhalla is even better. It starts with a little intro passage which then turns into a song that sounds like Iron Maiden, slowed down a bit, but made 100 times heavier. The galloping is definitely there, but it's more of a Children of the Grave type song. In the middle, they throw in about two minutes of soloing. Excellent stuff. This is what makes Manowar have any sort of a claim towards the title \"Kings of Metal\" - none of their later pretentious bullshit. This is just solid epic stuff that fucking rocks.\n\nRevelation (Death's Angel) is the last great song - it sounds like another rejected Maiden number turned really dark. \"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner...\" Excellent, with solo after solo. \n\nThen, the rest of the album isn't quite as strong. Hatred just kinda plods along after that monster Diamond Head style opening riff. (Lightning to the Nations) It never quite gets out of intro mode, though the solo is pretty nifty. Secret of Steel is utter crap that really doesn't do anything other than sound like they used too much LSD. March For Revenge is pretty long, but what's with that random instrument in there? Is that the triangle? The most metal instrument ever?? Then there's a really silly passage in the middle that is a chilling reminder of silly Manowar interludes to come. Oh dear. \"When we march, your sword rides with me.\" This is really fucking pretentious here, and you can clearly hear the sound of a shark being jumped.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty decent album, with some great tracks on here. It's not 100% good all the way through, but when it sucks, it still does not suck as much dripping donkey cock as other Manowar albums will do. There is no An American Trilogy here, and for that I thank them. Furry loincloths and all, they are forgiven.\n",
        "\nOkay, so how the title track did not make it onto Warriors of the World is totally beyond me... this is a quality song - well, except for the really cheesy middle part which Manowar seems to force itself to do with just about every fast song nowadays.\n\nThen, I Believe is a generally decent ballad - far above average for Manowar standards, but nonetheless merely average. \n\nThe final track is Call to Arms, which is on Warriors of the World as well. And this song kicks monstrous asses of numerous species - probably the greatest Manowar song ever done!\n\nIs this worth getting? It's a single ... I'd just download Dawn of Battle and be happy at that, as Call to Arms is available elsewhere and I Believe is kinda expendable. Nonetheless, 2 great songs and one average one is a good thing.\n",
        "\nAfter 6 years, the pretense repository must have been just boiling over, because somewhere in the middle of a solid heavy metal album, it suddenly fucking explodes, wiping out half the album in a flurry of utter and abject stupidity.\n\nThis album has some of their best stuff, and some of their worst - it's like a totally polarised version of Kings of Metal in some strange way, on many levels. In the middle, there is crap. That is the fractal nature. Good songs with crappy middles, and then the middle of the album is crap, and finally the ending songs are good again, but with silly interludes.\n\n\"Call to Arms\" is fucking classic. Legendary, momentous, amazing, glorious, in every possible way - this just may be my favourite Manowar song of all time. They definitely borrowed something from the WASP catalogue - something in the way of dead-on melody. Yes, it's just as cheesy as \"Brothers of Metal\" or \"Hail and Kill\" or \"Manowar\" or another N tracks with similar subject matter, but this one just comes out absolutely fucking right. Even the obligatory slowed-down section is quite nicely done.\n\nThen... \"Fight for Freedom\" starts off slowly with some cheesy spoken stuff over some remarkably lame and undermotivated piano parts (guys... WASP again... Thunderhead... go listen to Thunderhead 437091798 more times and learn correct use of piano) - then it builds up and goes into a midpaced bludgeoning rocker. Solid when all is said and done.\n\nOkay we're not going to talk about the next few songs for a bit - we're gonna skip ahead to the title track because that is where the album goes back to sounding like a Manowar album. No wait - like a GOOD Manowar album. We'll dissect the five slabs of pretentious bullshit in the middle in just a little, kids - so hold on.\n\nAnyway, Warriors of the World. One of my favourite metal memories is my friend Alex and I riding through the streets of Brooklyn, at 4am after a Virgin Steele show, and BLASTING this very song. Over and over again. This is excellent headbanging material - well, except for that hideously silly middle section. Just about every good song on here has a little slowdown in the middle, and this one is the most overt and just about the worst. But the rest of the song is awesome, especially that chorus. It almost - not quite, but almost - makes me understand what the big deal is about this band, about the whole Metal Warrior image. Not quite, but fuck yeah that's a fun singalong. \n\nThen, Hand of Doom, a much faster number, and also very excellent. Except in the middle they kinda fuck it over with some silly half-thrash riffs - not quite as bad as that sounds, but for a few seconds the song does get kinda awkward. Pick up the pace already - yes, here we go, nice chorus. Rock, kids - rock like there is no tomorrow. That is why I can't take Manowar all that seriously - even when they're cranked to their 11, it's only a 9 on the global scale because they keep wavering. They can be quite good, but so often they have to throw in the cheesy shit, just to make sure the audience is aware that, after all this time, they're still tr00.\n\nOkay, we get the point. Less interludes, more fucking riffage. Anyway, House of Death is also very good, except of that stupid part in the middle. But when it explodes into the guitar solo, all is well with the world again. Fight Until we Die is similar, also quite good - this is not all that differentiable from other average heavy metal, but hey, it fucking rocks and is fun to sing along to cranked to maximum volume, so it's good stuff. If they could be like THIS all the fucking time, they would just about be the greatest metal band ever. This song also has the notable tendency of going at 100% speed from beginning to end. Admirable.\n\nOkay so that was the good. What about the bad, you may ask? Two stupid synth pieces (Valhalla and The March) are total throwaways. What about the other three tracks? Please, Grandfather, tell me a story - about the other three tracks? Who were those tracks?\n\nThose... were the FECES!!!!! One silly opera thing... Nessun Dorma. Okay in and of itself it's not bad, but Manowar isn't about being Opera Warriors. Then, Swords in the Wind is the shit ballad that Manowar must put on every album. \n\nAnd what of the last song? This is just about the worst song in the history of existence. This is giving \"31 Flavors\" (Sacred Reich) a run for its money in the \"stuff that sorely wishes it were mallcore\" category. This is so fucking cheesy - even my mom doesn't listen to this kind of crap. \"Oh I wish I were in Dixie.\" Oh I wish you were there too. So I wouldn't have to hear you in Boston. I'm not even going to comment further on this absolute outrage - an insult to the sense of hearing, this one is. \n\nWhen all is said and done - well, some of this album is quite good. As I said, Call to Arms fucking owns everything in sight. This is incredible shit. Some other good tracks too. Manowar should seriously put out an album with 12 balls-out rockers in the Call to Arms vein. Hell, they can put in some ballads too, but make those grab you by the throat too... (Forget swords, just ride the wind forever free.........)\n\nI submit to the court one \"W.A.S.P.\", the true Kings of Metal. Give me a circular sawblade codpiece over a fur bikini any day.\n",
        "\nSo they finally did it. Manowar have finally begun to make a joke out of themselves\u2026 I mean, when I bought this record I couldn\u2019t not possibly imagine that I would be laughing so much of their new material as I did\u2026 unfortunately, because I had hope that after \u201cLouder than Hell\u201d the guys could reinvent themselves and finally start entering into the new century \u2026\n\u201cDEATH TO THE FALSE METAL, BLA BLA BLA, BLA BLA BLA, BLA BLA BLA (and other loads of verbal shit = Joey DeMaio\u2019s boring crap\u2026). Well, they must now be preaching death to themselves, as we cannot, in our perfect senses, really call this a true metal record. Fine\u2026we cannot call it a complete fuck up, it has four good songs, but it would be a lot better in the form of an EP with only these ones.\n\nManowar just cannot evolve, I mean, it\u2019s not by covering a classical song, a bulk of another American songs and adding some acoustic guitars that they\u2019re going to make a really big breakthrough\u2026 For them the time machine has simply stopped somewhere\u2026They just keep living in the 80\u2019s, and the most hilarious is the fact that they just don\u2019t seem to want to make anything about this. Of course that there are always those fans that are forever loyal to the usual crap (the usual songs, the usual beer, the usual girl, the usual bikes\u2026) and the band keeps that tired image for those fanatics, but they have also been losing some fans (including me) for always being playing the same shit, years after years. They could start listening to a little bit more of the European Power Metal melodies and heaviness that were inspired by them, and really start evolving towards a new and fresh sound AND\u2026ALSO DEVELOP A NEW IMAGE\u2026because that thing with all those black leathers simply has to stop.\n\nWell, I think that DeMaio probably had an accident with his house and half of it that had all of the metal records must\u2019ve burned down and he got stuck only with his Elvis and Puccini records, I have no doubt about it!!! I never heard Manowar making anything like this\u2026\nIt starts with \u201cCall to Arms\u201d that is a good song, well composed, well produced, with a catchy chorus and a good guitar sound but then comes the downhill of the album that begins with \u201dFight for Freedom\u201d, a song that although having the patriotic side, being dedicated to the victims of the WTC attack (and I kind of liked the fact that a metal band finally got the guts to do this, one of Manowar\u2019s few positive points in this record!!), it\u2019s not one of the best songs they\u2019ve ever made\u2026\nThe pain then starts with \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d and what the fuck is this??? I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026\u201dNessun Dorma\u201d is a good song, but by Manowar? You\u2019ll have to hear it to believe that this is just what Manowar shouldn\u2019t have done\u2026\nNext and continuing the parade of the useless crap comes the crapiest fuck up on this album. \u201cValhalla\u201d his a throwaway synth forged song, we can definitively see something\u2019s going wrong with Manowar to have to be forced to put a filler in the middle of the action\u2026I mean, first comes a boring song, then a Puccini cover (!?!) and next a less than 40 seconds throwaway\u2026man\u2026these guys really need to take some more time of vacation, because those seven years weren\u2019t enough\u2026\n\u201cSwords in the Wind\u201d is also very cheesy and boring, with all that stupid lyrical crap they always write about Vikings and that kind of shit\u2026I think we are all a little bit tired of this now aren\u2019t we? \n\u201cAn American Trilogy\u201d its just bad, a really bad bulk of combined songs\u2026 It\u2019s hilarious that these guys that had written a song like \u201cMetal Warriors\u201d now play this kind of stuff\u2026well anyway I think the guy was Elvis Presley, not \u201cEric\u201d Presley\u2026\nNext comes\u2026oh no\u2026 not again\u2026please\u2026not another fucking synth and piano instrumental\u2026the difference between the boring \u201cThe March\u201d and \u201cValhalla\u201d is the fact that this load of auditive crap takes longer than \u201cValhalla\u201d . My God\u2026 I really thought that I would have to sell this album the day after I had bought it but\u2026 the next four songs really changed my mind and made me believe that this was not a gigantic pile of shit but just another kind of an \u201cabortion\u201d album\u2026 \n\u201cWarriors of the World United\u201d is not good or bad, just nothing worth mention\u2026you might like it, but for me it\u2019s repetitive and boring and a perfect example that Manowar\u2019s lyrics and their music just can\u2019t make that big jump\u2026\nThen finally we start to see the light of day on this record\u2026\u201dHand of Doom\u201d is a very good song. Karl Logan just rips everything apart with that fantastic solo at the beginning of it\u2026Good song, good chorus and rhythms, a positive point for the Viking boys on this album. \n\u201cHouse of Death\u201d has a good intro with a great solo, and the rest of the song actually manages to be pretty good\u2026I\u2019m proud of Scott Columbus on this one.\nTo end it all comes the really heavy \u201cFight Until We Die\u201d. A good finisher and a good form of redemption after the complete parade of crap of the first songs. One of Manowar\u2019s best.\n\nOk\u2026this could be a LOT better!! Not a Manowar album that can honour completely the things made by them in the past. WARNING to your wallet\u2026this is what I call a somewhat money waste\u2026my advice on this one is for you to get the first and the last three songs from the net and form your \u201cWarriors of Real Metal\u201d E.P from Manowar\u2026This is the age of the good and technical song writing, not the swords, shields and raw leather age\u2026That one has died for centuries and Manowar at every new album just risk themselves to die with it.\n",
        "\nFor some odd reason Manowar decided to release a second live album hot on the heels of their first \"Hell On Wheels\" one with virtually no \"inbetween\" time or a new album - total overkill you would say and in any other case this would be true, not so however for \"Hell On Stage\".\n\nFirst of all - the setlist is compromised of a bunch of fan-classics and \"forgotten\" songs - with many a jewel such as the amazing \"Bridge Of Death\", \"Dark Avenger\" and \"March For Revenge\". Secondly - none of the songs on this album is featured on their previous live release - making this a nice additional release and thirdly - the sound on this live release is a LOT stronger than on the previous one.\n\nBasically - I can say that this is one of my favourite live discs of all time - putting together an absolute handfull of classics with great sound. The only complaint is that instead of \"the warriors prayer\" or \"sting of the bumblebee\" - I would have rather had \"Pleasure Slave\", \"Fast Taker\" or \"Secrets Of Steel\" on there - but now that Manowar are on a roll with their live releases - there's not a lot of doubt that those songs will one day resurface on a live album / dvd as well.\n\nSuperb album - and a must have for anyone really...\n",
        "\nAnother 4 years between albums and finally a new Manowar release - and just like \"Triumph Of Steel\" this one is actually slightly underrated - and doesn't deserve a lot of the slagging it received from a lot of people.\n\nIn essence - Manowar somehow ditched a lot of the \"we're trying very hard to sound epic\" spirit in favour of a more back-to-basic rock & roll album - and succeed quite well at that. The first three tracks - although they somehow overdid it in my opinion - are quite decent \"metal anthems\" - and in case of opener \"Return Of The Warlord\" it's a direct follow-up to their original \"Warlord\" song - not bad at all - and they make great live songs, that's for certain.\n\n\"Courage\" tries hard to come across as a \"Heart Of Steel\"-type-song, and fails a bit at trying to stay on par with that song - but certainly isn't bad and a decent change from the first few songs. \"Number 1\" is probably the albums weakest song - not really going anywhere and easily overlookable - again - it's not bad - but certainly nothing special either. \"Outlaw\" is the usual \"speed\" track - and does quite well - and \"King\" is this album's attempt at trying to perform a \"Hail & Kill\" - and again - while this isn't as strong as the song it's mirrored after - it is performed very well - and belongs to my favourite tunes on the album.\n\nWe also get an overlookable guitar solo (nice change from a bass solo) to introduce new guitarist Karl Logan and which ends the 10 minute instrumental (\"Today Is A Good Day To Die\") - which makes a nice and atmospheric song.\nCloser \"The Power\" reminds a lot of \"Black Wind Fire And Steel\" and is an excellent speedmetal track.\n\nAll in all i'd certainly not shy away from this release either - as it holds up pretty well - and no matter what - Manowar deserves all credit for not wimping out and doing a grunge album or suddenly coming up with \"we never were metal\" or \"metal is dead\" one-liners - which seemed to be so popular during that period. Not bad at all.\n",
        "\n\"Triumph Of Steel\" is - as far as i'm concerned - very much underrated by a lot of people - it sure as hell isn't as good anymore as any of their first releases (and has one huge mistake) but overall the band does what it does well - more of the same - and especially Eric Adams carries this record from beginning to end - with some superb vocal performances. \n\nLet me start from the beginning with their \"main\" mistake - the overly long (27 minutes !) \"Achilles, Agony & Ecstacy in 8 parts\" - honestly - this could have been 4 parts shorter and noone would have even cared - there are some absolutely gutwrenching and boring moments on that song alone - like the overly long and rather unspectacular bass & drum solo's - which lead nowhere at all - on the other hand though - there ARE some excellent, speedmetal bits on there which are absolutely awesome - just next time you guys do something like this - shorten it by 20 minutes...that would suffice more than enough...\n\nThe rest of the tracks - I must say - are not bad at all - featuring one of my personal favourite Manowar tracks of all time - the excellent \"Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee\" - a superb basher. In fact the only \"weaker\" song is \"Metal Warriors\" - which is one of their now standard \"metal anthems\" - nothing special, although not bad at all either. The rest of the songs are well up to standard - with \"Master Of The Wind\" being the first \"real\" Manowar ballad - and succeeding very much at it - \"Power Of Thy Sword\" & \"Demon's Whip\" being two excellent longer songs, \"Burning\" a nice mid-tempo doomy song and finally \"Ride The Dragon\" an excellent speedmetal track.\n\nAll in all it might not be the perfect Manowar album - but the production, Adam's vocal's and a number of great songs certainly keep it up to a decent level - now if only they would have shortened that \"epic\" track in the beginning - things would have been a lot better.\n",
        "\nErh...intitially I found this album quite strange to listen too - even though I never considered it to be \"bad\" - it had an entirely different, more commercial feel to it than previous efforts - probably due to a lighter production coupled with the opening two \"party-rockers\".\n\nNot to say that the production is \"bad\" - not at all actually - but it just is less heavy and more rock & roll orientated than the first four albums - this album can more or less be viewed as a \"breaking\" album for Manowar. \n\nEven though the first two tracks \"Fighting The World\" and \"Blow Your Speakers\" are solid party rock & roll songs - I can't say that I was too impressed with them - at least not on a studio recording - they gain a lot in a live environment - that's for sure. \"Carry On\" also isn't exactly the strongest Manowar tune ever (even though I must admit to liking it quite a bit) with it's \"easy on the ears\" chorus - and \"Violence & Bloodshed\", although not bad, certainly isn't the best \"up-tempo\" song they ever recorded. \n\nSo to say - the first half of the album is quite ordinary - run of the mill metal - especially for a band like Manowar - who have proven in the past that they could do so much better. The album however - is completely redeemd by it's second half - starting out with the excellent \"Defender\" - an atmospheric, moody (and slow) tune on which Eric Adam's excells (it also features the haunting voice of Orson Welles once again) - up comes a small, overlookable intro (\"Drums Of Doom\") leading into the catchy \"Holy Wars\" (again - Adams steals the show in this one), unto another (slightly unnecesary) \"interlude\" (\"Master Of Revenge\") and into the album's highlight - the speed killer \"Black Wind Fire And Steel\" - another one of those timeless Manowar classics.\n\nNot a bad release overall - but not matching up with any other album in the Manowar catalogue either - it's worth getting for Adam's voice alone though - and certainly is better than a lot of other rubbish out there...but not essential - unless of course you are a Manowar fan.\n",
        "\nYet again - even though the first two albums certainly were not bad - Manowar manages to top those two with the release of \"Hail To England\" - a real classic if there ever was one.\n\nAlthough the sound in itself is slightly less \"heavy\" than on \"Into Glory Ride\" - the production certainly remains excellent and perfectly fits the collection of songs on offer here - some of which rank amongst the best the band ever did (and probably will ever do). Also very notable is the fact that this is probably Manowar's \"darkest\" album ever - if the mood on a song like \"Hatred\" was black - they managed to equal and top that with songs like \"Bridge Of Death\" or \"Each Dawn I Die\". Needless to say btw - that this probably is Eric Adam's finest hour as well - with some of the best vocal lines he ever spewed forth - brilliant.\n\nThe album starts off with the mid-tempo basher \"Blood Of My Enemies\" - an excellent anthem with one of my favourite Manowar chorus's ever - is followed by the slightly less spectacular (but still very good) \"Each Dawn I Die\", only to result into Manowar's fastest song to date \"Kill With Power\". \"Hail To England\" is an excellent anthem. Then we move on to \"Army Of The Immortal's\" - another typical Manowar anthem which is pulled off extremely well on here as well - and unto sadly the only couple of minutes that aren't really worht mentioning - the obligatory bass solo \"Black Arrows\". Luckily the album closes on an incredibly strong note with the mighty \"Bridge Of Death\" - Manowar's darkest and most \"evil\" song - and a firm fan's favourite.\n\nIf there is one Manowar album which belongs in every Metal collection out there - it certainly must be this one - a true classic release and one of Metal's finest hours as far as i'm concerned.\n",
        "\nManowar actually managed to top their debut album with their second release - \"Into Glory Ride\" - showing us a slightly different sound than on the first one.\n\nGone are most of the \"simple\" \"rock & roll\" tunes - who apparantly made way for a more epic - and occasionally very doomy - style of songwriting. Also most of the lyrics on here deal with the \"sword & sorcery\" themes which Manowar would explore and perfect in the rest of their carreer. The only two exceptions being \"Warlord\" (also being the weakest song on the album - dealing with...well...bikers and the biker-lifestyle) and \"Gloves Of Metal\" (another metal anthem - although not quite as strong as \"Metal Daze\" for example - but still holding up pretty well).\n\nThe main bulk of the songs - as said - is mid-tempo to slow and doomy and the band pulls this off very well (with a lot of thanx to Scott Columbus - who perhaps missed the speed of previous drummer Donnie Hamzick - but brought forth an awesome lot of power & innovation when it comes to his drumming). The main \"classics\" on here are the awesome \"Gates Of Valhalla\" (awesome !) & the long and epic \"March For Revenge\" - although it has to be said that the remaining three tracks aren't any weaker at all (especially the slow - driven anthem conan-esque \"Secrets Of Steel\" being a personal favourite). \n\nOh - and for those interested - for a change this album DOESN'T have a bass solo. \n\nAnyhow - an excellent release - topping \"Battle Hymns\" - but only just - and an excellent preparation for \"Hail To England\".\n",
        "\nThe first Manowar album proves to be quite the debut for the self-acclaimed \"Kings Of Metal\" - not yet dealing as much with the over-the-top image as would happen in years to come and concentrating more on the song-writing and music itself. \n\nLike said in another review - the album is basically split in half - although instead of taking the \"first five\" songs - i'd rather do a 4 - 4 - the first four being decent rock ' roll tunes (with \"Metal Daze\" and \"Fast Taker\" being the highlights - the first a catchy \"heavy metal anthem\" like the band would produce so many more of in the future (and probably a couple TOO many eventually), the second an excellent, speedy rocker). \n\nThe second half though is where it gets \"really classic\" - beginning with the anthem which would and will remain in the setlist forever - the band's namesake \"Manowar\", going into the excellent and atmospheric \"Dark Avenger\" (with a spoken interlude by Orson Welles) then the \"song\" which everyone usually tries to ignore (the obligatory bass solo) and finishing off with THE Manowar classic of all-time - the immortal and earth-shattering \"Battle Hymn\" - a true metal classic if there ever was one - and featuring one of Adam's most impressive vocal parts to date. \n\nThis album (and especially the second half) is what would define Manowar in years to come - sometimes epic, melodic, very powerfull metal - mainly carried by Eric Adams's vocals (to date being my favourite ever metal shouter) and Demaio's solid bass-work.\n\nDefinitely worth the money you pay - and a great introduction to a superb band.\n",
        "\nBeing a big Manowar fan myself, it's hard for me to remain unbiased on this review, but here goes. This attempt at a live album is anything but good. The idea is great, but being the loudest band in the world has it's disadvantages as well. To begin with, you can't hear the damned crown when they do the typical sing-along shit. It's not that there aren't many people there, it's just that they can't possibly make themselves present over the amps. \n\nAside from the lack of a decent crowd presence, the tracks they picked to put on the cd from their tour were good. Unfortunately with a song like Kings Of Metal, which is one killer song, the vocals really lack, especially considering the power which comes from layering in the studio that we've all come to expect. Wheel's Of Fire falls prey to the same problem, no back-up vocals....I could go on, but I think there's really only one song that stands out on this disc as being done good live, and thats Battle Hymn, and thus the end of the 2nd disc. \n\nThe quality of the recording is pretty decent, but you can expect that from live discs these days, what with overdubs and whatnot. I'm not entirely sure about this, but truly it does sound as though they decided not to tinker too much in the post-production department and keep it true to the live experience. Having never seen them, I wouldn't know what they're like live, but if this is any indication, ticket prices better be fucking cheap.\n",
        "\nSo here it is, Manowar's long awaited new studio album. The band did not disappoint this time, offering a very solid album, with some really great tunes, and quite nice variation in the songs. \n\nOne major difference on this album compared to most other Manowar albums is that there isn't as much focus on the bass, but the guitars build the base of most songs, which is never a bad thing. Not to say that there is no bass though, Joey's bassplaying is still very evident and it's all over the album. But on previous releases (especially Louder Than Hell) there was more bass than guitars. \nThe guitar riffs are excellent. Fast, heavy and headbangable. The album has some damn fine rhythm guitar work, and the lead guitar kicks equally much ass - Not as much as on, say, Battle Hymns, but it's still excellent. \n\nThe drumming of the album is quite nice as well; intense and heavy with a fair amount of double bass. But, Scott Columbus doesn't really show us everything he's got here, we all know he can do much better.\nEric's vocals are also amazing; he showcases many different vocal styles on the album. He displays his talent in many ways, including incredibly strong clean vocals, high-pitched screams, emotional vocals, and even opera on the song Nessun Dorma. \n\n\nThe first song on the album is Call To Arms, a quite midpaced, heavy opening track. It's followed by a nice ballad called The Fight For Freedom, which begins with some nice pianos but gets some heavier guitar riffs later in the song. Classic Manowar ballad which is good but offers nothing new. Then is the opera song Nessun Dorma, which is not bad at all. It showcases Eric Adams amazing vocal abilities very well. Then comes the Viking ballad Swords In The Wind, which is easily the best ballad Manowar have ever done. Everything about the song is excellent; emotional but powerful vocals, beautiful melodic guitar melodies, amazing lead guitars, and great basslines giving the song alot of power. \nNext is the Elvis cover An American Trilogy, which is just plain stupid. I've tried to like it, but failed. The March is a fairly well done instrumental, which is followed by one of the best songs on the album, Warriors Of The World United. \nThe verses are killer, quite midpaced, and sung in a cool, dark and raspy voice. The chorus is one of Manowar's best, totally majestic singalong stuff here! The slower bridge is quite good too, giving the listener room to breathe before the three final songs of the album. \nHand Of Doom, House Of Death and Fight Until We Die are all fucking killer headbangers, all played at a very fast pace, with evil lyrics, wicked basslines and awesome guitar riffing. Fight Until We Die also has some insane falsetto screams at the end. \n\n\nSo all in all, this is definitely a great album. Call To Arms, Warriors Of The World United and the three final songs stand for the heavy part of the album, while The Fight For Freedom, Nessun Dorma, Swords In The Wind, The March and An American Trilogy are all a bit softer. \nOne major flaw with this album is that half of it consists entirely of ballads. But all of the ballads are very different, so it's not like the same ballad repeated over and over again (See: Iced Earth - Something Wicked This Way Comes). \nStill, one or two heavier tracks would do no harm, while the album would be better of without An American Trilogy. \nNonetheless, most of the songs are good, and the good songs are really good. So, Manowar have with Warriors Of The World given us yet another great album.\n",
        "\nIn my opinion, Manowar have been kings of filler, as opposed to kings of Metal for a while. They always seem to manage to ruin otherwise respectable offerings with out of place tracks, most of which turn into nothing more than filler. Unfortunately, Warriors Of The World falls into the same problem, but thankfully, the songs that are good, are really good; is this not always the case with Manowar though, at least with their last couple of full-lengths?\n\nThis CD can be completely broken down into sections, since they lump the same type of song together one after another, something I\u2019ll touch on later. \u201cCall To Arms\u201d and \u201cFight For Freedom\u201d are both mid-paced, anthem-based songs, with driving guitars, simple drumming, and catchy vocals. \"Fight For Freedom\" does have a more uplifting and almost Power Ballad type feel at times, but overall these songs are quite similar. Both tracks are very good in my opinion, but it took me awhile to get into them. The drumming is not much more than bass, snare, bass, snare, cymbal crash, repeat, for almost the entire \u201cCall To Arms\u201d song. It is still a good song because the guitars, back up choirs, vocals, and lyrics are excellent. \u201cFight For Freedom\u201d falls into the same boat, but the drums have more of a marching feel. The next section of Warriors Of The World contains three ballads, plus one short instrumental. The first, \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d, shows off some amazing vocals from Eric Adams, but aside from that I don\u2019t see this song appealing very much to Metal fans. Not only does it sound out of place, but also this doesn\u2019t even fall into Power Metal ballad territory. This wouldn\u2019t be such as a bad thing, that is until you listen to the next 2 full songs. \u201cSwords In The Wind\u201d is by far the best of the bunch; the song is a typical Metal ballad, which picks up with some slow-paced guitar playing at the end. The song is about Vikings and Nordic culture, which I\u2019m a huge fan of, so I enjoyed this one. \u201cAn American Trilogy\u201d is the next ballad, and this is a horrible song. Sorry, but I found almost zero redeeming qualities about this track, it is out of place, unnecessary, and overly boring after listening to the two ballads before it. Why put all the ballads in a row? I was about ready to give this release a 30 at this point, but things pick back up with \u201cWarriors Of The World United\u201d, which follows the same song writing principles as \u201cCall For Arms\u201d, but Manowar somehow, despite repeating themselves, put together a very enjoyable and quality song. I was still a little dismayed at that point, praying that there would be no more ballads and perhaps one, at least semi-fast track. Well, the Norse gods must have been listening because up next is 3 killer, fast, and powerful tracks. \u201cHouse Of Death\u201d, \u201cHand Of Doom\u201d, and \u201cFight Until We Die\u201d are full of double bass, fast, almost choppy riffing, and aggressive vocals. These songs give us plenty of variation with some breaks and diverse vocals as well. The lyrics and choruses are once again excellent with the energy factor being very high! \n\nWarriors Of The World wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it would be based on the middle section, but what is with the track order? Yeah, you could just hit random, but I like to listen to CDs in their proper order. If they placed some fast tracks at the front and spread out the ballads this would be a lot more enjoyable. probably would have bumped the score up to 85. As mentioned, the drumming on the mid-paced songs is pretty bland, these songs would be even better with a spruced up drumming performance\u2026 oh well, at least we get to hear some more varied performances on the last three songs. I would say most Manowar fans should like this, and fans of Heavy/Power Metal would probably like this too despite the mid-section. This is all assuming themes concerning the glory and victory of Metal and all associated topics about battle and swords, with a touch of Nordic themes, don\u2019t turn you off. Of note is that I\u2019ve seen a lot of used copies of this CD floating around (which is understandable, this won\u2019t be for everyone, that\u2019s for sure), so keep your eyes pealed and you might get a good deal.\n\nSong Highlights: Call To Arms, Warriors Of The World United, House Of Death, Hand Of Doom, Fight Until We Die.\n",
        "\nManowar has always been one of my favorite bands, so the main question for me with this new release for was if they still could deliver after a rather lengthy 6 years without releasing any new studio material ? Of course I am more than glad to say that Warriors Of The World easily fulfilled all my expectations, and while the album does have its faults, is another example that Joey & co. still manage to come up with a more than worthy song material.\n\nThe band obviously wanted to go for a straight kill by placing the excellent \"Call To Arms\" (with borrowed \"Blood Of My Enemies\" riff) on the opening spot of the album, followed by the semi-ballad \"Fight For Freedom\", which by all means is okay, just nothing spectacular. Next up is obviously Eric?s moment of glory with \"Nessun Dorma\" and sees his most impressive vocal performance on a Manowar album since \"The Crown And The Ring\". \"Valhalla\"/\"Swords In The Wind\" (\"Valhalla being a short atmospheric intro) is easily my personal favorite, reminding me (once again) of the glorious days of \"Hail To England\" or \"Into Glory Ride\", epic, majestic and powerful, exactly the way the band should sound. I can be short about \"American Trilogy\" because in my opinion this is the album?s worst track, by no means is it terrible, but I fail to see who they are doing a pleasure with this Elvis cover. \n\nStill, it?s all upward from here again, with another instrumental intro (a rather lengthy one this time) leading us into the first single \"Warriors Of The World United\", perhaps the most catchy and radio-friendly song on the album. Finally the album finishes off with three absolute, high speed killer songs, namely \"Hand Of Doom\", \"House Of Death\" and \"Fight Until We Die\" (from which \"Hand Of Doom\" is my favorite, and also my second fave on the entire record).\n\nThe cover artwork and production are like usually first class and lyrically, well, you know what to expect from a Manowar album, so no surprises on that front either, just the normal \"Metal\", \"Kill\", \"Die\" and \"Brothers\" lyrics. \n\nHowever, there are two small complaints which somehow tempered my euphoria about this album - the first one is the running order of the songs. A little bit more variation could have been brought into the album by switching around some songs (eg. one of the faster tracks in front), but this problem is of course easily solved by using the program function on your CD player. The second one however, is not, and probably a little bit more severe and involves drummer Scott Columbus. While the other band members are on constant show-off mode with excellent performances throughout the entire album (especially Adams), Scott?s role in all of this somehow seems to be reduced to that of a living metronome. Of course, his drumming is not bad, but this guy showed the world exactly what he could do on \"Into Glory Ride\" and \"Hail To England\" so it is quite sad to see his playing reduced to nothing but the simplest of drum patterns, while it?s obvious from the live-shows that he still has the power and skill to come up with far more than on offer here. \n\nOf course both of these \"complaints\" are easily forgiven and looked over. For me this is definitely one of the best albums this year, and will, without a doubt end up quite high on my end-of-year list. Hail and Kill !!!\n",
        "\nThis album, like most every Manowar release, has its really great songs, and then its complete misfires. They're really easy to categorise too, for the most part - we end up with a few songs that make sense, and a few that absolutely don't.\n\n\"Fighting the World\" - a very good song. Catchy, with some nice riffs. You really can't expect more out of a midpaced heavy metal song. Nice solo too. \"Blow Your Speakers\" is a bit weaker, in that the riff work isn't as well defined and the chorus totally sucks, but it's pretty decent. \"Carry On\" is also pretty damn good. These first three are pretty solid, although not exactly the next coming of Priest in the East. But still, nothing to demand skipping.\n\n\"Violence and Bloodshed\" - fuck yeah!!! Total speed metal here. THIS is the type of song that the so-called \"kings of metal\" should be playing: aggressive and melodic at the same time, with great vocals by Eric Adams and great guitar work too. Then, the album just crashes and burns. \"Defender\" sucks - it's got the spoken part, and the rest of the song doesn't go anywhere, just kinda sits there, repeating the chorus a few times. You always expect the guitars to suddenly burst out and envelope you in flames of speed metal, but ya know, that just doesn't happen here. In fact, we then have more wankery on \"Drums of Doom\". Hello, where are the SONGS??\n\nOkay, we then have \"Holy War\" - it's pretty average, but at least it's got some solid riffs in here. A bit cheesy, but a decent song. Then, we get to \"Masturbation of Revenge\" - it's like most of the second half of this album has been completely wasted by stupid screwing around.\n\nFinally, \"Black Wind Fire and Steel\". Finally!!! Nice songwriting. Again, they should just concentrate on THIS, as opposed to trying to build all this atmospheric crap and prove their tr00ness or whatnot. Just play some fucking heavy metal already!!\n",
        "\nYa know what, some of this album is absolutely awesome and perfect, and some of the greatest stuff that Manowar has ever done. Then the rest - WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING?? The good part is, the WTF moments are not quite as excessive as on some other Manowar albums, and there are some really truly great songs here. \n\nThe amazingly fucking excellent: \"Heart of Steel\". Say what you will about the Manowar image, this song just fucking rules, and rules hard. One of the best ballads of all time. STAND AND FIGHT!!\n\nThe great: \"Wheels of Fire\", \"Kings of Metal\", \"Blood of the Kings\", \"Hail and Kill\". Yep, the four fastest songs on here, well at least the three with the most memorable riff work, as \"Kings of Metal\" is not all that fast compared to the other two - but these three could have been on \"Screaming for Vengeance\". The thing with \"Hail and Kill\" is that the intro is kinda boring, but it would have made the second-best ballad Manowar has ever done (other than Heart of Steel, they just haven't ever gotten it right... well, you only need to do something good ONCE to be immortal!), and then after a minute of that, pure headbanging killer frenzy.\n\nThe average: \"Sting of the Bumblebee\", \"Kingdom Come\". The first is a bass solo - not bad, just not up to calibre of the other songs. It's based on a classical composition that I cannot remember right now, and is executed nicely. \"Kingdom Come\" has no distinguishing features - just a boring heavy metal song.\n\nThe bad: the rest of the songs each suck in their own particular way. \"The Crown and the Ring\" is just plain boring. \"Pleasure Slave\" - don't get me started. This is the song that some Manowar fans apparently live and die by - the lyrics aside, the music is so unbelievably crappy. Then, \"The Warrior's Prayer\" - it's just a little spoken part. Never mind how cheesy it is, but if I want to hear speaking parts, I'll call 1-800 Weather, okay?\n\nSo what we have here are 6 out of 10 great songs, and then some crap. Some of it is filler, others just don't execute. Manowar just try too fucking hard sometimes, and they completely overshoot their objective, leaving behind solid songwriting in the process. If all the songs on here were like \"Hail and Kill\", we would have... well, we'd have \"Painkiller\" but still, we'd have a fucking metal classic!\n",
        "\n\"Return of the Warlord\" indeed!!! Return to the fine 1982 form of \"Battle Hymns\" with great heavy metal anthems that, for the most part, don't sound forced or pretentious at all. There is only one crappy ballad, and one overlong \"epic\" number that really isn't all that bad. In other words, only one song that really demands to be skipped, while the rest features a fearsome intensity not seen in any previous Manowar studio album.\n\nThe first song, \"Return of the Warlord\" is definitely one of the best songs they've ever done. It just fucking WORKS - unlike so many of their other songs that fail to be catchy or utilise riffs correctly, this one just grabs you by the throat and kicks your face in several times. Next, \"Brothers of Metal\" is a bit less effective, but it sure beats the \"part II\" of the previous album. This song isn't as fast or constantly driven as some of the others on here, and thus it's a more \"typical\" Manowar song - but still, not bad.\n\nThen, \"The Gods Made Heavy Metal\". Really damn simple riff under the verses - pretty much the same note over and over again, but hey, that's catchy as fuck, and it WORKS. Yes, Manowar are going with metal ideas that work here - a lot of people blasted them for this album, but ya know what, sometimes you gotta just shut up and rock. And this song does just that - it's almost thrash in parts, and rules.\n\n\"Courage\" is justifies the existence of a skip button. Manowar ballads suck, except when done live, then some are great. Moving on, \"Number One\" is also very nice, as is \"Outlaw\", which is practically speed metal, and then the break in the middle (\"shot through the heart, in the blink of an eye\") provides a really effective counterpoint to the rest of the song.\n\n\"King\" starts off slowly, but then turns into a midpaced riff-oriented headbanging monster. Nice groove here, just a very cool headbanging song. \n\nThen, \"Today is a Good Day to Die\" - well, this IS Manowar after all, so they do have to put in their gratuitous pseudo-psychadelic interlude - lots of bass soloing and whatnot. This is kinda questionable to skip or not, the only real problem is is that it's nearly 10 minutes - very overlong. \n\nThen, \"My Spirit Lives On\" continues the previous song and then turns it into an introduction for \"Power\", which closes the album off in incredibly good fashion. Pure fucking speed metal here - the riff work is total Judas Priest, and there is a really great guitar solo in here too. Another highlight.\n\nSo what we have here is Manowar not afraid to sound like Judas Priest at times - before they were so intent on being \"tr00\" and whatnot, that they just forgot to scream metal like there's no tomorrow, and put out boring product after boring product. Here, they hit upon a real winner. The best Manowar album, hands down.\n",
        "\nThis is Manowar before they got all epic and tr00 on us - it's still there, but there are some great songs that actually lack the overwhelming pretentiousness that would scar their latest albums, and - simply because they didn't try so damn hard to be otherwise - come off as pretty solid and well-written.\n\nNote: I do not have the remastered version. I am going on the original, which has a slightly rock and rollish vibe to it, both in songwriting and in the guitar tone. The album can be pretty much divided into two parts: the first five songs, and the last three.\n\nThe first five are pretty straightforward heavy metal songs, that would not be out of place on a \"Killing Machine\" or a \"Breaker\". Of these, \"Shell Shock\" is probably the weakest, due to the generally uninspired chorus. \"Manowar\" is probably the best - it's pretty typical heavy metal, with some really catchy and well-defined riffs, something that Manowar would not be all that consistent in in the future.\n\nThen, the second half of the album, which is interesting, in that they go for a more epic power metal idea. They start Dark Avenger with the first of many, many spoken parts that they would have. The song itself is very nicely done power metal - probably the best song on here. All the riffs work, and the soloing is tasteful and effective, without any excess wankery that would mark some of their later epic efforts. \"William's Tale\" is the obligatory bass solo - very nice, as it's the William Tell Overture which of course can do no wrong. \n\nThe last song is \"Battle Hymn\", which also rules quite muchly - another epic metal song, with a well done chorus, and in general well-placed melodies. \n\nThe strongest suit of the album is that the songwriting just plain works - there is nothing forced about it, and no silly ideas are thrown in just because they seem like a good idea at the time. It's a very solid album, and well worth getting.\n",
        "\nMy goodness this album is terrible at times. They just cannot find any sense of consistency in the songwriting department. The first song, Achilles, in many many parts, is just a complete mishmash of pretty much every possible heavy metal idea that Manowar have ever tried - lots of gratuitous soloing (there's a fucking cymbal solo) and the actual song doesn't go anywhere or do anything.\n\n\"Metal Warriors\" is just boing as fuck. Imagine the really really straightforward and completely incident-free construction of a song like \"The Number of the Beast\". Now imagine something even more so. There's nothing to drive the song forward, it just kinda plods. \n\nThe highlight of the album is probably the second half of \"The Demon's Whip\"... it finally gets around to doing something. Also, \"Ride the Dragon\" is decent too, but then the album closer is a hideous ballad, \"Master of the Wind\". In general, Manowar does not do ballads that come of well in the studio. Not even \"Heart of Steel\" is good in the studio, even though it's godly live. \n\nYes, Manowar are far better a live band than a studio band - for the most part, the studio songs lack life and inspiration, and just go through the motions. This album is probably the most accurate example of that - just questionable ideas thrown over songs with no biting or catchy riffs.\n",
        "\nHere we are. The first studio release from Manowar in six-years, and the first Manowar album I was able to purchase as a new release since becoming a fan three years ago. Naturally, I had stratospheric expectations for this album -- so perhaps, I am as much to blame for my disappointment as the songs themselves.\n\nThe track-sequencing of \"Warriors of the World\" sets it apart from other Manowar releases. It's also my biggest complaint. After the heavy-handed opener, \"Call to Arms,\" the listener must sit through four consecutive ballads, along with two mellow instrumentals. I enjoy the instrumentals, myself; to me, they are much more listenable and musical than those filler Joey DeMaio bass solos that blemish some of my favorite Manowar albums. And while I like ballads, the ballads on this album are not very memorable. I don't mind the surprisingly faithful cover of Puccini's \"Nessun Dorma,\" but I could do without the half-baked 9/11 tribute, \"Fight For Freedom,\" or \"The American Trilogy,\" a coma-inducing cover of three patriotic oldies songs. Of the ballads, only \"Swords in the Wind\" gets me singing in the shower, but that probably has more to do with its Odin-worshipping, Norse lyrics than the strength of the song. \n\nIt's not until Track 8, when the band starts to build on the foundations laid down by \"Call to Arms,\" my favorite track on this album. \"Warriors of the World United\" is one of the catchiest songs in the Manowar catalogue, probably because of its singsongy chorus and a simple, infectious riff that the band repeats over and over. The next three tracks (the last three) are the album's heaviest. However, they suffer immensely from the album's polished production -- Manowar's most polished to date. The versus and choruses of these songs aren't very memorable either. In fact, they contain some of Manowar's simplest and most recycled lyrics to date (eg. \"Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky / Together we'll fight, some of us will die / But they'll always remember that we made a stand / And many will die by my hand). \n\nI am being pretty harsh. This is not a bad album, by any means; it's just not what I expected from DeMaio and crew. I will still listen to it on occasion, especially when I want to hear \"Call to Arms\" and \"Warriors of the World United.\" However, there is no guarantee I will listen to it as much as 1996's \"Louder Than Hell,\" or any Manowar album for that matter. \n"
