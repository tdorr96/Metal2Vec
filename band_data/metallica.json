        "\nHi Metallica, it\u2019s me, Metal. I know we don\u2019t have the best relationship but I just want you to know, I forgive you and respect the choices you\u2019ve made. Still doesn\u2019t change that this album is bad though. In recent years I\u2019ve been seeing more forgiving ratings of Metallica\u2019s even more controversial sixth record, \u201cLoad\u201d. I find this sudden positivity a little odd, and not a response like mine where I'll admit that the album isn\u2019t horrible or horrendous but simply just not a very good record, no it\u2019s more like bigger jumps and revisions that \u201cLoad\u201d isn\u2019t actually bad but really good. I remember as a kid hating this record, I listened to tons of classic rock records thanks to my brother and dad, stuff that Metallica clearly took major influence from for the creation of this album. When the radio would play something off of \u201cLoad\u201d or \u201cReload\u201d, I wanted to turn the radio off because I was so bored. Years later, as I had to place myself in a spot where I couldn\u2019t escape from the music to get through a few listening sessions to get this review going, I luckily didn\u2019t hate it as much as I did as a kid. Matter of fact, I don\u2019t hate it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s horrible, I just simply think it\u2019s not a good record.\n\nThis is mostly going to be a negative review but I would like to present what I believe are the positives. The band itself, James, Lars, Kirk, and Newsted, all put on a solid performance (for the most part), there are some decent songs on this record such as \u201cKing Nothing\u201d, \u201cUntil It Sleeps\u201d, and \u201cAin\u2019t My Bitch\u201d, the lyrics are fairly personal and can get pretty dark at times (though also pretty cringe at times as well), and finally the production is pretty good as it has a fairly heavy metallic rock sound and the mix is well adjusted. That\u2019s it. No seriously, that\u2019s all I got for the positives, sorry to disappoint anyone thinking there was more but you can blame the band for that. To start, Metallica\u2019s choice to move on to a harder hitting blues rock album than a straight metal album is not a bad idea in theory, just like any changes in musical direction, but the execution as a whole severely lacking and half baked. Yes I know those metal elements are still in place, except for their thrash roots that have been dumped and forgotten, but the hard rock elements that sprung up from the body of \u201cThe Black Album\u201d have fully replaced the skeletal structure of the band's sound on \u201cLoad\u201d. \n\nTo be very blunt, the music is dull and uninspired. While many of Metallica\u2019s peers may have transitioned, evolved, and implemented new sounds and ideas within each of their individual core sounds, Metallica decides to simply make a record that harkens back to a older, bluesier hard rock style that had clearly gave them an influence in this albums direction, with Bob Rock being a strong factor for these decisions as well. The issue isn\u2019t Metallica reaching back in the past and bringing those influences as a basis for a full album (make it two) but the issue is that the music is so basic, so repetitive, and at times way too long. It lacks what made Rock N\u2019 Roll so good, so iconic, and let alone enjoyable. While Metallica was doing this, many other bands were, at least attempting, to take some fairly new elements that have sprouted out within the last decade and mix it up a little. Kreator messed around with Industrial and goth metal, Slayer with some nu-metal, Sodom fucked around with death metal and crossover, Testament with death and groove metal, and Overkill with groove metal and some industrial in \u201cFrom Underground And Below\u201d. Say what you will about the incorporation of groove metal, at least it was a fairly new genre still by the time of 1996 for bands to mess around with. But Metallica decides to go for a heavy bluesy rock record yet never does anything with it, nothing to make the genre \u201cfresh\u201d or \u201cexciting\u201d or go out of their way to do anything new. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve sat myself in my work van doing my normal routine while listening to this five times in five days and I can tell you I hardly remember most of the songs on this album. The first track \u201cAin\u2019t My Bitch\u201d has a little energy to it, but the main riff is extremely simple and repetitive. The moody \u201cThe House That Jack Built\u201d has James decently utilize his cleaner vocals, though it\u2019s clear that his vocals are shot from the extensive touring of the previous album, and may be the only song on the record that I found a little interesting structurally though the main riff is still fairly basic stuff. That same moodiness is carried over to the next track \u201cUntil It Sleeps\u201d, which I already expressed as being one of the better tracks, and once again the next track \u201cKing Nothing\u201d being a little more aggressive and catchy. \n\nOther than that, I can't remember much of the rest of the album. Every single song follows the same basic outline regardless if it\u2019s a \u201csofter\u201d song or a \u201charder\u201d song. You follow the main riff throughout most of the song, a secondary riff comes after the main, then Kirk lays down a forgettable wah-wah-ified solo, then back to the main riff. I don\u2019t remember any song that significantly steps away from this formula. I believe there\u2019s plenty of cases that a band can be formulaic yet still have those songs be outstanding, all it requires is for the riffs themselves to be distinct enough from one another. Well Metallica didn\u2019t get the memo because they rehash similar melodies throughout the record and the simplicity of said melodies and riffs make it much more noticeable. Have you ever noticed how the build up at 1:39 in \u201cCure\u201d sounds awfully similar to the buildup at 1:45 in \u201cKing Nothing\u201d? Well I did, hell they both have that build up around the exact same time as well huh? Funny stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s just extremely basic shit as there\u2019s no real standout riff that grabs any attention to the listener that hasn\u2019t already been done significantly better from past artists. Metallica even has songs dancing towards the country side of music, such as \u201cHero Of The Day '' or \u201cMama Said\u201d, and it still is extremely simplistic and dull. Where\u2019s the life of the music? Where\u2019s the memorable hooks? Where\u2019s the bands fucking balls? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s clearly not here. I\u2019ve heard constantly from many different individuals that \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d is their favorite from the record, probably the best song on the album. I question why because I found \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d to be one of the worst songs on the album. Take all of the negative things said about \u201cLoad\u201d, the repetitiveness, the simplicity, the unoriginality, and then make it a slog for almost ten minutes. It\u2019s so fucking exhausting, it\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever disliked about Metallica wrapped up in a sloth of a song. It sucks man.\n\nThe best thing I could ever say about \u201cLoad\u201d is that it is \u201cserviceable\u201d. It\u2019s the type of music you place on in the background just to have some noise going on and not to actually listen to it. Regardless of my thoughts on \u201cThe Black Album\u201d, it at least HAD some good riffs and hooks in it. \u201cLoad\u201d just feels like an even bigger step down. I can\u2019t even say any of these songs are \u201cgreat\u201d. A couple of songs are good, others somewhat decent, the rest being terribly forgettable. I read a comment from one of the more positive reviews lamenting that I should be thankful that Metallica didn\u2019t just make the same album over and over again and actually try something new. Well you fucking know what, fuck you, if I had the choice between having \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d, \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, or even \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d made over and over again or choose my \u201cLoads / Reloads\u201d and \u201cSt. Angers, I\u2019d rather have the former any-fucking-day of the week because at least those albums actually had well thought out, good writing and are some quality stuff. Doing something new is not an automatic \u201cget out of jail\u201d free card to erase the negative reviews for a stale piece of bread. \n\nOnce again, I like when bands do something new, especially when they actually incorporate it well into their sound and make some great music but I\u2019m also somebody that will praise a band wanting to keep the \u201cdon\u2019t change what isn\u2019t broken\u201d thought process if they\u2019re still making quality material. While not a terrible album, or as bad as others screeched about for the past three decades, \u201cLoad\u201d is not a good record regardless with very little standing out in its bloated one hundred and eighteen minute length and fourteen song track list. Everyone in the band may be solid, despite James' shot vocals and Kirk's reliance on the wah-wah pedal, it\u2019s not hard for musicians to play well when everything about the music is relying on simple rhythms and repeated formulas in the music's structure in every track. Forgettable and boring, maybe \u201cReload\u201d will be better\u2026\u2026\n",
        "\nAh yes, the black album. Everyone knows about it. Everyone has heard Enter Sandman. This could be the most famous heavy metal album ever made, so of course elitists and hipsters hate it. Is it the worst thing ever? Absolutely not, but it does indicate the softening of some of their edges. Additionally, I could imagine fans at the time were let down, as it seemed that up until And Justice For All, Metallica was becoming more complex and ambitious. Instead of going further into technical territory, they simplified and slowed down their thrash metal sound, removed many progressive elements such as tempo shifts and time signature changes, and implemented traditional pop song structures rather than having, for example, meandering interludes like before.\n\nAll that being said, there is no point on this album where I think \"this is fucking terrible.\" Some of the lyrics are hamfisted as hell, such as the second verse of Enter Sandman, which features extremely weak rhymes and metaphors. But that's not new, Hetfield has always struggled with lyrics, remember \"now your life is out of season\"? Master of Puppets is one of their best songs, and even that one features a few bum lines. Some odd musical choices are made as well, such as splicing in a random Leonard Bernstein section from West Side Story at the beginning of Don't Tread on Me, (which is honestly also a pretty weak track in and of itself.) Despite the simplification going on in the structure department, Metallica still decides to not pare their songs down, and some tracks, such as Sad But True, don't have enough to say musically or lyrically, so they end up going on for far too long. One could also argue that including two ballads, one of which is a super tame love song, is also a mistake, but I think The Unforgiven and Nothing Else Matters are actually pretty damn good.\n\nThe positives on here definitely outweigh the negatives. The Unforgiven is a contender for one of their best ballads, juxtaposing brooding heavy parts with some of the most tender acoustic/clean parts they've ever done. The Struggle Within and Through The Never are the two fastest ones on here, so the band definitely plays to their strengths with these; but, the songs don't exactly sound like thrash because they were made for a mid-paced radio-oriented heavy metal album. I think some of the deeper, more obscure cuts such as Holier Than Thou and Of Wolf & Man are also quite enjoyable. My Friend of Misery is the one (1) Jason Newsted writing credit on here and its main riff is quite infectious and melancholy, further emphasizing Newsted as one of the most talented (but intentionally under-utilized) songwriters the band has had among its ranks. Even big hits such as Enter Sandman and Sad But True, which are by no means the best on here, still carry that seal of good quality. The instrumentalists are good enough, but Kirk's solos have taken a pretty noticeable dive after his rather monumental performance on Justice, which is a minus. On the other hand, Hetfield, despite all his yeayeaahhs and OHs, puts on one of his best vocal performances (maybe even his best ever) on here as well, which is a big plus.\n\nMetallica was one of my gateway bands, I think that's true for a lot of people. This is their most popular release, so you could accuse me of having nostalgia goggles on because I view this childhood discovery fondly. But I don't really believe in the \"popular thing bad\" logic that so many people seem to ascribe to this release, especially when the following 20 or so years of Metallica material is both undeniably and incredibly worse than this is. Sure, this self-titled release heralded their transition into shitty butt rock, but the way people lump this one in with turds like Load and Reload as if those albums are remotely comparable to this one is utterly laughable. Yeah, it's simple and toned down, but it's not shit.\n",
        "\nBy now, everybody and their brother is familiar with the thrash giants that put the genre on the map. With controversial takes existing everywhere on every spot of Metallica\u2019s discography, it\u2019s sometimes nice to just peel back the layers and taste the core of a classic\u2019s excellence. Being only the band\u2019s second record, Ride The Lightning signals the hint of constant change as they progress forward, a stunt that would stick for every record in the band\u2019s career. Stylistically, is it that different from the explosive debut? Nah, but writing wise, this may already be one of the biggest shifts in tone.\n\nThe obvious part is how clean of a leap James and co. made only one year later. While this is important in the context of the early \u201880s, it\u2019s even more compelling when you figure Ride The Lightning\u2019s title track and opener \u201cFight Fire With Fire\u201d are two of the heaviest songs the band has ever written. The bridge following the chorus in \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d leading into that chaotic windstorm of a solo absolutely smolders the listener with burning intensity under an umbrella meant to invoke colder feelings. That\u2019s beyond incredible in and of itself before you even consider how cleanly this is pulled off.\n\nMoreover, Metallica did what I think advanced the thrash genre to another step. While early output may warrant a tough time splitting the hairs of speed and thrash metal, they managed to give that a heavier definition here. By that, I mean they nailed the \u201cthrash but not necessarily fast\u201d style that many bands would take and run with before. I\u2019m not saying it hadn\u2019t been done before 1984, I\u2019m saying the line was sharpened substantially. The instrumental closing masterpiece \u201cThe Call Of Ktulu\u201d shows this in some of the finest progression of its time, coating itself in the aggressive attitude and harder punch without the need for constant speed. The classic hit \u201cFor Whom The Bell Tolls\u201d is a more obvious example of this, keeping the same steady but heavy pace the entire run, not sidestepping the style at all. Catchy choruses and melodic verses all over the record can't cause that to happen.\n\nFew are gonna deny the excellence of the sophomore masterpiece that is Ride The Lightning. But I can\u2019t help feeling that it gets unfairly underpraised, sandwiched between the monumental titan Master Of Puppets and the sweaty and sticky energy of Kill \u2018Em All. Even the weakest moments on this (see \u201cTrapped Under Ice\u201d) are still incredible. It being one of the fastest songs, yet one of the most overlooked speaks volumes about the tighter cementation of the direction they took. When the ballad \u201cFade To Black\u201d gets more recognition than a speed metal gunshot, it\u2019s pretty telling where the important factors are, even if this didn\u2019t land with some fans right away.\n",
        "\nMaking this review feels a bit odd; years ago I wrote a review on Metallica's Master of Puppets, pretty much bashing one of the \"holy grails\" of metal music, and now I'm here reviewing probably the most controversial metal album ever, by the same band, and giving it more rating than I gave MoP. While my opinion on the aforementioned album did change since then (although it's still not very positive), my opinion on this album is one I don't think I'll ever really change; this is a rather awful, yet peculiar album, which I hated listening to as much as I got a certain degree of enjoyment out of it.\n\nSt. Anger went wrong in many levels, yet Metallica managed to make a release that somehow doesn't truly manage to be all bad, but it basically just blue-balls you all the way through it by never breaking the barrier of being actually enjoyable, but also never becoming something completely unbearable. The music itself is this weird mix of groove/nu-metal, hard rock, some thrash and even some metalcore, the riffs are rather heavy but not in the way the band's old riffs were, but more in that \"though guy chug\" style. The album tends to switch between these heavier parts and some melodic choruses and sections which bring some catchiness to the music and makes the chorus of the homonymous track be stuck in your head for a bit. There are still some remnants of '90s Metallica in the music, with their '80s sound almost totally lost, being replaced with a more alternative approach to songwriting which was more in line with what used to get radio play during the early 2000s.\n\nThe music feels somewhat odd, but at times it can definitely get you engaged at least for a few seconds, be it because of a catchy guitar lick, a nice blast beat, or a groovy section which reeks of Pantera or Drowning Pool. The work on the 6-strings manages to be both interesting and baffling, and the total lack of solos or lead guitar licks makes the album feel noisy and repetitive as fuck. The guitar tone is certainly bad and it lacks a proper body in my opinion, and the good old drum snare sounds like it came from a goregrind album, which together with the virtually inaudible bass, and the rather lousy mix, makes the record somewhat annoying. The vocals aren't much better; Hetfield was never a good vocalist in my opinion, but St. Anger is something else, as all its 11 songs are filled with a rather bad attempt by James to sing like a nu-metal vocalist but just managing to bring a harsh-esque hard-rock-ish voice and several cringe-y shouts and voice cracks.\n\nWhile I'd argue that listening to a single song off the album while shuffling a playlist might be mildly enjoyable, listening to the entire 75 minutes of this album in one session can certainly give you a headache; the repetitiveness of the riffs, the unnecessarily long songs, the awful snare, the mix and the total lack of lead guitar work makes the album feel dense and boring after the first 30 minutes. A few songs such as \"St. Anger\" and \"Some Kind of Monster\" are fine-ish individually, but by the time you get to \"Invisible Kid\" you probably don't even realize you're listening to a different song than any of the previous 4 tracks, and you still have two thirds of the album to go, which is also an issue I found with MoP and other of Metallica's releases.\n\nEven if St. Anger is rather bad, I can still give it a few points just for managing to be interesting at times, and also because the band didn't really give any fucks when making this and decided to pretty much experiment with their sound. This album is never going to be good, but it will also never stop to be a peculiarity with a few good moments, and a record that will be permanently engraved in metal music's history due to its infamy rather than by its musical merit.\n",
        "\nI was listening to \u201cHypnosis of Birds\u201d the other day for the umpteenth time, Holocaust\u2019s grand progressive gem, on which \u201cThe Small Hours\u201d is easily the weakest track, a rowdy brooding presence that ruins an otherwise solid homogenous surreal psychedelic trip. It beats me why John Mortimer had decided to awkwardly insert an old composition into a new incompatible-with-it frame\u2026 ah, I know why! Cause he\u2019d heard this version offered by this new budding act from San Francisco, California, and had decided to improve on it\u2026\n\nonly that he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t cause the Four Horsemen knew their unfluences inside/out, and knew what would work during these songs\u2019 renditions, and what wouldn\u2019t. Besides, what a better testing ground for the newcomer Jason Newsted than jamming along on a couple of forgotten hits? Cause if he fails to deliver on those then his stint here would be rendered meaningless\u2026 right? Surely the Flotsams would take him back for another bass-dominated speed/thrashing doomsday\u2026\n\nwhen I heard this slab the first time, I had no idea those cuts were covers, although that wasn\u2019t very hard to guess, after a few listens mind you, having in mind the diversity in both execution and mood. For me this was another fairly entertaining offering from the new hotshots of metal who were trying various things along the way, amazingly invariably reaching the same level of success. Quite a few years later I sit here now, knowing the originals only too well, also trying to find any pitfalls in this at first sight/listen frivolously assembled, just-for-the-fun-of it effort\u2026 and I can\u2019t find many\u2026 not many at all.\n\nThis was to be the first recording the band would put out after the tragic death of their friend, comrade, colleague and mentor Cliff Burton. To overcome grief of such proportions is a barely surmountable chore, but as the most tired cliche in the universe says, \u201cLife has to go on\u201d\u2026 and so it did, with a new kid on the block whose mettle was to be tested on a covers-only compilation. A trend-setter this one as well, the first covers-only slab in the annals of metal\u2026 resting on its pioneering merits alone would have sufficed, but this outing, which could easily pass for a mini-LP with its shutting down just south of the half-an-hour mark, also reeks of quality and good taste. \n\nDamn right it does, opening with the eponymous \u201cHelpless\u201d, the best song the English veterans Diamond Head ever composed, the closer of their excellent debut thanks to which in some other, much fairer than ours, universe this outfit are still the definitive stars of the show\u2026 stardom eluded them big time, sadly, but their US counterparts very handsomely compensated for this grave injustice in the years to come. A shining speedster this one, served here with a thicker, heavier sound naturally, the highlight on this garage filler which gives even monotonous hypnotic hymns like the mentioned \u201cSmall Hours\u201d a gem-like status. A vast improvement over the original, especially on the fast-paced segment which here is turned into a vehement thrashy tornado, this is another sure hit. Another deep bow to the lads for knowing their stuff so profoundly\u2026 I mean, who would go the extra mile to unearth Killing Joke\u2019s angriest, most metallic (until the arrival of \u201cExtremities, Dirt and\u2026\u201d) piece, and turn it into an even angrier, aggrandized thrasher? But of course Metallica! Another strike in the bull\u2019s eye with this one, before one bumps into a \u201cCrash Course in Brain Surgery\u201d\u2026 sounds like some impossibly complex progressive thrash with hefty echoes of proto-death\u2026 title wise that is. Yeah, right! This is 1987, not 1998\u2026 and the bluesy hippie-like guitars betray the actual dinosaur here, the 1974-born anthem of the Welsh act Budgie, the least known presence here, but the one that granted Newsted admission to the band line-up: you can\u2019t hear the virtuoso bassisms on this one and not throw the guy a medal or two for his dexterous pyrotechnics. Needless to add, boosted denser riffage and a slightly accelerated layout have been provided to stifle the pleasantly archaic aura this number exudes in spades, but all good, bordering on the great. \n\nHitting the finale now, the Misfits duo, the one that I couldn\u2019t quite come to terms back then, and even now\u2026 to a smaller extent though. A punky closure to a serious metal show although the guys do brutalize the cuts, especially the second half, this green inferno very close to hitting the grindcore parameters. And, honestly, can you really frown on \u201cLast Caress\u201d, both text and lyrics-wise, the perennial catchy sing-alonger that\u2019ll make your baby hug you even closer\u2026 also having in mind that Misfits were one of Burton\u2019s most favourite acts, it does make sense the presence of this disparate but compelling combo, a fitting bow to the guys\u2019 late comrade albeit ruined by the very last notes\u2026 did you detect a semblance of Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d intro on those? Good if you did; to these ears this very brief tractate can pass for anything out there\u2026 literally\u2026 including for an obscure etude from, say, the Led Zeppelin repertoire.\n\nAdd the enormous therapeutic effect this recording had on its creators, and you have another sure winner. The guys were looking for all possible ways to vent out their sorrow, and the fact that they had even found someone who might as well fill in Burton\u2019s huge vacated shoes, served as another gust of inspiration. They don\u2019t take liberties with the originals, contemporary (for the time) more aggressive updates notwithstanding; each song is easy to recognize\u2026 if you\u2019re paying tribute to your idols, you should be as faithful to them as possible, right? Truth be told, this isn\u2019t exactly a very far trip down memory lane, the only genuinely old tune is the Budgie one, \u201cThe Small Hours\u201d and \u201cGreen Hell\u201d were barely four years old, the other numbers taken from 1980\u2026 but they all so nicely fit together that there must have been some premeditated scheme behind this; this was by no means a random jamming session based on whimsical picks\u2026 James is James, his feats behind the mike always reliable, identical to the ones that graced \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d a year earlier\u2026 he could have pitched it a bit higher on the Budgie anthem, but I guess helium balloons weren\u2019t available in the garage. And let\u2019s not forget that this effort wasn\u2019t intended as a test for him, it was targeting the new boy in town, Mr. Jason Newsted, the former Flotsam, who swept the charts with flying colours. \n\nA big sigh of relief from everyone involved, and onward to victory with \u201c\u2026 And Justice for All\u201d\u2026 justice was done, justice was found, justice was vindicated\u2026 including for all those forgotten heroes whom the Four Horsemen have set on immortalizing\u2026 heroes who had all the rights to walk on that avenue of the finest alongside them, all the way to the impending Apocalypse.\n",
        "\nIs there a more polarizing album in metal history? When Metallica was at the height of their powers, commanding arguably the hungriest fan base in music, and slowly but surely building mainstream popularity (AJFA reached #6 on the billboard charts), they went pop? Well, that is an awfully simple way to put it, but the Black Album is a record constructed to catapult Metallica to biggest-band-in-the-world status, right there alongside Guns N' Roses (who they toured with) and Nirvana. And on that front, the diamond record is one of the greatest successes of all time, bringing heavy metal to the forefront of American media, and paving the way for countless other bands (and regrettably, genres like nu metal) to achieve platinum sales and rockstar status that was previously unattainable.\n\nThe music on the other hand, falls somewhere between strong heavy metal songs with catchy riffs and slow ballads. And although these are drastically different camps of songs, most fans of one enjoy the other, and most \"Black Album haters\" will hate both kinds of songs. The band strays very far from their Kill 'Em All days, but anyone following their music closely would realize that this was not the most unexpected step for the band to take following their semi-prog ...And Justice For All album, one that has all but reached legend status among vast swathes of thrash fans. With the release of \"One,\" a hit single from their 1988 record, the band began seizing a wider audience, especially with the music video that accompanied it. So, seeing that their popularity had virtually no ceiling, Metallica sought to maximize their commercial potential and said to hell with thrash. I mean, they gave us three and a half classics anyway, right?\n\nWell, they don't completely ditch the thrash elements, they mostly just take a back seat. \"Enter Sandman\" is a mid-tempo track with a surefire riff, simple lyrics, and an ear worm hook. Was there any chance this wouldn't be a hit? Similarly, \"Holier Than Thou\" has some thrash elements and a much more intricate song structure, while \"Through the Never\" is for all intents and purposes a short thrash song amidst a sea of pure heavy metal. By contrast, the infamous \"Nothing Else Matters\" is a power ballad far from the likes of \"Fade to Black,\" as there is almost no metal in this song and the lyrical content is somewhat edgy (in a bad way). \"The Unforgiven,\" on the other hand, is a strong ballad and holds its weight against the band's back catalog, although the two spinoffs from subsequent albums that the song produced do not.\n\nAnd then comes the less popular, but still notable, deeper cuts that the band occasionally throws into their live performances. \"Sad But True\" was almost a hit, but this sort of sounds like a grunge song meets \"The Thing That Should Not Be.\" It's heavy, the riff is chunky, James sounds menacing on the vocals, but it's pretty superficial. The last few songs sort of blend together, all following a dismal lyrical theme with similar song structures. The band's playing is solid on all of the songs, James comes up with extremely catchy riffs as usual, and Jason Newstead plays some excellent bass lines. Lars's drumming is replaceable, but it isn't bad- it just doesn't sound like him. And Kirk delivers decent solos, none of them are \"One\" but they aren't bad. The problem for many fans is that a lot of these songs sound similar to each other and none of them are very creative. The band wrote what they knew would sell, and really, can you blame them?\n\nThe main exception to this pattern is \"Wherever I May Roam.\" This song is absolutely killer, with creative guitar work and an intriguing drum performance that differs from the rest of the album. It leaves you wondering what the album would have sounded like if they committed their efforts to crafting songs like this: still mid-tempo and far from thrash, but a lot more unique and arguably complex. That opening lick gives me chills still!\n\nThe production is passable on this album, it's very clean to convey the band's new identity with pristine clarity. This is a new Metallica, one that is ready to do coke with models and hog up the spotlight. Gone are the juvenile drunks who just wanted to bang their head against the stage. And again, who can fault them for this character development? They're hailed as gods in thrash metal some forty years after their inception, and they still managed to get worldwide popularity. Every album they put out goes #1 in dozens of countries. You might hate that they abandoned their roots, but think from their perspective for a moment. Why die on the altar of thrash like the rest of the thrash bands did in the 'nineties when you're the reason they all existed in the first place?\n",
        "\nThe day has come it seems, choosing to review Metallica\u2019s most profitable and, most likely, well known album; their self-titled fifth record or what many just call, \u201cThe Black Album\u201d. If you asked me in my younger days, the days where I started to maneuver through the metal landscape; being a big fan of thrash metal, I\u2019d probably list off all the stereotypical comments on how the band \u201csold-out\u201d and what not and that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s terrible. Over time those types of comments kind of just went to the wayside as I came to realize regardless of one \u201cselling out\u201d, what really mattered was the quality of the product. When I criticize \u201cThe Black Album\u201d, I don\u2019t care if it was a sell out or not, what I care about is it\u2019s quality, especially after it\u2019s rise to infamy for the band. One word I used a couple of sentences above, \u201cterrible\u201d, was a word that I described the record as when I was younger. That is not the case today. By no means am I saying it\u2019s good, something that\u2019s pretty clear by the ranking and my ongoing review, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a terrible record or even necessarily a bad one. It\u2019d say it\u2019s closer to being bad but I do find some elements to be decent, even one element to be fairly great. There\u2019s so much to break down regarding the album; the production, the writing, the performances, hell even the impact is something I\u2019d like to cover. This review is going to be fairly sizable, a long man if you will, so fair share of warning. \n\nI think the best aspect about \u201cThe Black Album\u201d and the only variable that I\u2019d consider great, is the production. Pop-rock / punk producer, Bob Rock, is already a well known name in the history of Metallica and the metal scene and, despite his\u2026questionable choices, choices that will be covered over the course of not just this review but all the other reviews I\u2019ll probably make with his name attached to, you have to give the man some credit when credit is deserved. Bob does have an ear for producing punchy, heavy, yet clear sounding albums. Really, the production is great and in terms of production quality, despite my favoritism of \u201cRide The Lightings\u201d production, is probably the best sounding record the band has produced. The guitars are super aggressive and heavy, especially Hetfield's rhythm section, Hetfield's vocals are also surprisingly crisp and clear to the listener, the bass is super audible (thank god), and Lars drums are bone rattling. Another positive that I\u2019ll just add onto here as I think makes sense with talking about the production is stating that everybody plays well, though them being perfectionists and doing several takes of recording can give enough results to pick out the best sound bites (I wonder how many times Lars had to record his drums on this one). So yeah, James, Kirk, Jason, and even Lars sound in top form. \n\nAnd after that, those are probably the \u201cmost\u201d positive things you will hear from me. So what\u2019s the big deal? If you said the production sounds great, and the band is playing real good, wouldn\u2019t you say that should make this album good in your eyes? Well little Billy, there\u2019s a thing called context and the context for the reason as to why that\u2019s not the case is for a simple thing, yet entirely one of the most important things about a record; the writing. Most importantly, the writing of the music outside of the lyrics, the instrumental writing. Over the years, Metallica got a name for themselves being fairly technical and, after \u201cMaster Of Puppets'' and doubling down on \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d, somewhat progressive the band decided for a much more simplified writing style for \u201cThe Black Album\u201d. \n\nThe issue isn\u2019t entirely because it\u2019s simple, the issue is that not only is it simple, it\u2019s highly repetitive and monotonous, something that was clearly carried over from \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d minus the actual interesting and good stuff from that record. The album lacks variety and with that, an engaging album structure. Like, I swear to god, you go back to back to back with simple slow-mid paced rhythms with 1 or 2 riffs that are stretched throughout and, outside some riffs and structures, songs start to sound similar to each other, for example, the main rhythm section to \u201cSad But True\u201d and \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d being awfully similar with just small touches just for mainstream audiences to go \u201csee that 1 chord there! That makes it totally not sound like that other song on the very same record!\u201d. I could also mention how \u201cThrough The Never\u201d and \u201cThe Struggle Within\u201d both share a similar energetic one two riff but I think you guys should get the point. \n\nSpeaking of sounding similar, James sounds almost exactly the same on all of the tracks and this isn\u2019t a \u201coh it\u2019s just the style or sound of his voice\u201d, no, it\u2019s a \u201cI\u2019m going to sing every song as if it\u2019s \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d kind of thing\u201d. Like, yeah, he sounds good here but too fucking bad almost every song he sounds the exact same, no change in infliction or syallable prounaction, just one way. The only outliers are the two ballads, \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d and \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d but guess what? The soft parts when James sings \u201cand I dub thee unforgiven\u201d sounds awfully, no, exactly the same way he sings the soft part in \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d when he, well, sings the title. Like, just the way they wrote those parts and how James goes about singing them, if I wanted to, I could switch both lyrics into the opposite song and nothing would be lost because they would sound exactly the damn same. Like fuck man, I\u2019m going to actually say this. The way Aaron Randall sings on \u201cPhoniex Rising\u201d and \u201cSnake In The Grass\u201d and the instrumentation on Annihilators fucking \u201cSet The World On Fire\u201d album sounds much more distinct listening to them back to back compared to James fucking Hetfield on \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d and \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d. Let that sit in for you. Yeah, it\u2019s a wild claim, something that I\u2019m even shocked to admit but after listening to all four of these songs, well, it just seems that\u2019s the case. I\u2019m not even going to get started about all of the \u201cyeahs\u201d, \u201cah\u2019s!\u201d, and \u201coohs\u201d on the record. You know them, you laugh at them, let\u2019s move on. \n\nLars drums is equally one of the worst offenses here with the rinse repeat repetitive playing throughout the record. Bringing back \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d and \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d, both have playing one and two, one and two rhythm sections going throughout. Oh let\u2019s add \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d having a similar, though a little more energetic, rhythm section as well. How could I forget that \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d and \u201cMy Friend Of Misery\u201d also share similar\u2026I\u2019ll stop myself there because I know I\u2019d be beating a dead horse. To sum it up, most of Lars' drumming is entirely simplistic, samey and dull. I know Lars came out in an interview saying one of the reasons why he chose for a much more simplistic play style here was because he found the \u201cprogressive Peartian paradiddles\u201d became boring to play live. Now, I could understand wanting to write and play some simple songs, especially after all the more technical feats earlier in your career. But there\u2019s a big difference between writing and playing much more simplified rhythm sections and then flat out being lazy and practically reusing the same drum rhythm for every song with very minimal changes. That\u2019s just lazy and it\u2019s clear that, with the success of this record, it put into Lars mind, \u201cwhy should I even practice on my drumming when I can shit out a turd and the mainstream audience will spend hundreds of bucks to eat it?\u201d and paved the way for the mediocrity that is his playing to this day. \n\nAnd really, to sum up Kirk\u2019s leads and Jason\u2019s bass lines, they both do alright but it\u2019s so repetitive and simple and I don\u2019t want to keep comparing or pointing out songs over and over again. But to wrangle back to Lars comments about being bored with the more technical approach, that\u2019s the crux of this whole album and mentality that the band had. After everything, \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d being a main factor, the band just wanted to simplify their work which is a fine thing to do. The issue is being repetitive with not much variation. When you have an album full of similar riffs, hooks, rhythms, and progressions, it becomes a problem where songs begin to blend and lose their own identity. I mentioned in my \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d review the issue of simplistic repetitive writing taking up a good portion of the review and the band just decided to make a full album like that with \u201cThe Black Album\u201d. It\u2019s really hard for me to even care about the lyrics which are actually pretty good and offer a new change being more personal and self reflecting. But in the end, why should I have to sit through dully written music that has a hard time differentiating itself to get to said lyrics? The answer is I won\u2019t. For all the albums from thrash bands at that time that people said imitated \u201cThe Black Album\u201d, I can swear that most of those records at least had plenty of songs that at least sounded different from one another and tried to have some variety. I guess one thing I will give \u201cThe Black Album\u201d is that it is actually fairly catchy.\n\nAnd with that, onto my next topic, why did \u201cThe Black Album\u201d become popular? I think there\u2019s three main reasons as to why the record became such a big hit. One, the changing of the industry. Two, it being a fairly simple and catchy record. And three, production. One could wrap those last two with the industry changing but I think those little topics are as much important themselves than to all be grouped. First it was clear that things were changing, a storm was blowing if you will. Grunge was on the rise, groove metal and nu-metal was beginning to get its legs, and the focus of more personal, introspective lyrics was being a new vocal point in the music industry. Then, you factor in that the core of mainstream music is fairly simplistic yet catchy and finally you factor the production values which these bands were having; super clear yet heavy sounding mixes. With all of that, you get success, and Metallica struck that. \u201cThe Black Album\u201d is not a grunge album, nor a groove metal album, it is a rock / metal album. But it\u2019s clear that it had all of these things that these new up and coming bands and genres had. It had introspective lyrics, it had a heavy and clear sound, and it also was a simple yet fairly catchy record. \nIt came out at the right place at the right time and really, that\u2019s just it. \n\nSo after all this, ranting, complaining, whatever tickles your fancy, am I saying that the record is bad? Really, at the end of the day, \u201cThe Black Album\u201d is a halfway decent record, bordering on mostly decent. That\u2019s it. Some of you may ask, \u201cBut Metal, you talked so much about its issues, matter of fact it takes up the bulk of your review, shouldn\u2019t you grade this as a bad score or something?\u201d and answer to you, the album may be simplistic, repetitive, monotonous, and dull, but I don\u2019t really think that the songs themselves are \u201cbad\u201d per say, except maybe \u201cSad But True\u201d. Like I do like some of these songs, such as \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Tread On Me\u201d and I will give credit when credit is due, a good portion of these songs are catchy, and they do sound good and are played well. But the apparent flaws are so apparent, that whatever good things that can be taken from the record such as it\u2019s catchiness, the production and sound, the playing, etc. have such a uphill battle because of the writing that it\u2019s impossible for me to give the record more than a 65% (which it isn\u2019t clearly since you can see what I actually ranked it). It's clear that Bob Rock did exactly what he does on any album he produces, turning it into a simple and dull record yet catchy and having a good sound. I don\u2019t care if this was a sell-out, I don\u2019t care if this wasn\u2019t a thrash record, I care about the quality and, if the band had just\u2026 added some variety to the whole record, I think the score would be much higher. But it wasn\u2019t, \u201cThe Black Album\u201d was a lazy affair and while I respect the impact it did for metal and helped bring the genre to more of the public eye for generations to come, it also certified this statement, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s good or well written or well made\u2026what matters is that it makes money\u201d.\n",
        "\nMetallica is a band I'm sure most who browse the metal archives know. Formed in 1981, they had a somewhat controversial early history, mainly due to lead guitarist Dave Mustaine's drinking problems, but nonetheless just 1 year after their first demo, they put out their first full length, Kill 'Em All.\n\nAs the noisy intro to the opener \"Hit The Lights\" is played, you get your taste of the proper beginning of Metallica, with a steady thrash riff going from rhythm guitarist James Hetfield, he screams the opening lines. James's vocals on KEA rely heavily on screams and shouts, which can be a bit of a headache to anyone coming into this after, say, AJFA or the Black Album. It's a con for me as James clearly hadn't yet developed a complete vocal style as he did on later albums like the Black Album or Load. It's a bit of an improvement over the No Life 'til Leather demo tape, but studio magic will do that to anyone's vocals.\n\nOn lead guitar we have Kirk Hammett, and while Kirk may not be the most well-respected lead guitarist among metalheads, he does quite the sound job on KEA, with my favorite solo of his being on \"The Four Horsemen\". The tone of his guitar matches the other instruments and he synchronizes quite well with Hetfield's rhythm guitar. The rhythm guitar riff-work provided alot of base for other thrash metal bands (at the time) to follow and improve upon; as I'd say due to Metallica being big into NWOBHM at the time the riffs are closer to British heavy metal rather than what would be seen on later thrash releases. This applies to the solo's as well though there's definitely much more thrash in the solo's then the riffs. I couldn't imagine one of Kirk's solos on this record being in, say, an Iron Maiden album.\n\nOne complaint I have about the album is how long it is. It definitely overstays it's welcome at 51 minutes long; with many of the songs surpassing the 5 minute mark. There is really no reason why songs like The Four Horsemen or Metal Militia need to be over 5 minutes, as they could be condensed to a more reasonable 5 minutes or below. One good example of this is the song Seek and Destroy, the penultimate song on the record and one of Metallica's live staples. Seek and Destroy is the second longest song on the record, clocking in at 6:55. While it has a memorable opening and riff, a majority of the song is filled with filler solos and pretty mindless shouty lyrics from James Hetfield. It is a perfect example as to why this album is much too long (and don't get me started on the 18 minute Seek and Destroy on the Live Shit album).\n\nRegarding bassist Cliff Burton he does a good job on all the songs, Pulling Teeth of course being his instrumental masterpiece, which accompanied with Lars Ulrich's drums makes a good break from James and Kirk's thrashy madness. I once heard someone say Cliff plays bass as if he's a lead guitarist and I'd say that's true for this and Metallica's follow-up album Ride The Lightning. As always, it's a shame he died so young, but for what we do have on this record, it fulfills.\n\nIn conclusion, Kill 'Em All is the mark of a band still in artistic development, but one that showed incredibly promise for what's to come. Despite that the album itself overstays it's welcome, and is a bit too repetitive to justify it's 51 minute run-time.\n\n-Someone who's rather grateful, and somewhat dead inside.\n",
        "\nIn 2000 the sequel to \"Mission Impossible\" hit theaters around the world. While directed by Brian de Palma, the first part was well received by both critics and the audience, the action-packed sequel by John Woo strongly divided cinemagoers, consequently suspending the series for 6 long years. On the film's soundtrack, in addition to the likes of Foo Fighters, Rob Zombie and Chris Cornell, we could find a special Metallica song: \"I Disappear\", to which an impressive video quickly was created. The song itself was also included in the release promoting the soundtrack and it is this single that I would like to present today.\n\nCurrently, you can find several versions of the single, differing slightly in content and degree of \"rarity\". I have a single track CD in my collection, but you can also buy a CD that has the title track as an instrumental version as well. The CD is packed in a thin, plastic box and the cover is quite average: just blurred flames and a smudged silhouette of a pigeon at the bottom (white \"flying rats\" is a motif constantly present in John Woo's films) - the photo adorning the soundtrack itself, which we can see in the insert, looks much better. Apart from the thumbnail of the full album and even more flames and pidgeons, there is nothing else inside: there are no lyrics, which is strange because the insert can be unfolded, but the inside is completely unprinted. Was there not enough time or the will to fill this empty space with something?\n\nThe track itself reminds a bit of what you can hear on \"Load/ReLoad\", so if you're expecting thrash metal, you'll be sorely disappointed - \"I Disappear\" is a very simple, easy to listen to, commercial one might say. Not too heavy to be played on the radio, with a (not bad) solo, so that the fans don't accuse it of selling out too much, but above all, it gets to your ears quickly thanks to both the main riff and melodic, calm chorus. The whole is accompanied by not very ambitious lyrics, in which each verse consists of barely two lines repeated over and over again, but you know what? It works. I like to play \"I Disappear\" from time to time, because sometimes you just have to listen to something so casual. It's not a bad \"hit\" and it's a pity that the band didn't go that way, because the other tracks written at that time (\"-Human\" and \"No Leaf Clover\") were, in my opinion, really good. Would a full album in this style be better than \"St. Anger\"? I dare say yes.\n\n\"I Disappear\" is an interesting thing for the fans of the Californian foursome: a number you won't find on any album of the group, the last track recorded with Jason Newsted in the line-up and, at the same time, the reason for the legendary trial with Napster (one of the first P2P programs). The single seems to be sloppy and the person responsible for editing the track also overslept a bit (for the first seconds we hear something that seems to be a fragment of another song, and then there is a brutal \"cut\"). But because of its historical value it is worth having in your collection. Personally, I recommend to look for the version containing also the instrumental \"I Disappear\" - after all, it's always those few minutes of music more. \n\nOriginally written for www.metalside.pl\n",
        "\nI didn't know how to feel when Hardwired came out. While the production issues which absolutely destroyed Death Magnetic's mix have been rectified, my two cents is that this album is mostly filler, especially on disc 2. It's hard for me to remain objective here because it really was a long time between this one and the last one, almost twice as long as the gap between St. Anger and DM. And yet, really only half of this album comes close to surpassing the previous release.\n\nI'll admit, the singles were all promising, and if everything on here was as good or even a little less good than those, it would have been fine. However, they just aren't. Almost the entire second half of this album is rife with pervasive mediocrity and unmemorable tunes. And there's way too many of them! Doesn't Metallica understand that we don't need 77 fucking minutes of material every single time? I would have been okay with just the A side with Spit Out the Bone and Lords of Summer somewhere in there, but no, they had to clog it up with massively shitty little turds which are just a slog to get through. Skip skip skip. I just can't understand why they thought this was good.\n\n\"Hey guys, remember how Lemmy died recently? Let's make the most boring shit to remember him! Not a Motorhead-style track such as Jason Newsted's stellar Long Time Dead, oh no. We're going to remain at a constant mid pace the whole time and never say one memorable line.\" WHY. They are clearly capable of just doing a Motorhead cover or speed metal song, but they chose to honor him with one of the worst songs on here, Murder One. These are the guys who pioneered American thrash? Could have fooled me! Slowed down, boring, hookless cringe such as ManUNkind, Am I Savage, Murder One, and the other ones just clogs the hell out of this release.\n\nYeah I'm angry, they made me wait 8 years for what I thought would be another decent return to form, and sure, they gave us Halo On Fire, Atlas Rise, and other good stuff, but it's juxtaposed with such shit on the other disc! I mean who likes that hot garbage they crammed onto here? I didn't know what to make of it for many years, I was perplexed! But I've had 5 years to really stew over it, and I think I've come to the conclusion that this is just a band that's out of ideas. Hardwired, for the most part, is a real sad attempt at stoking the flames of a clearly burnt out creative process. Shameful that Kirk and Rob had barely any input, it really does sound like the band is operating at half capacity.\n\nAnd that's why this album gets a 50%; Hardwired is ultimately only bearable for about half its run time. It's insane to me that there are people out there who prefer this over Death Magnetic on a musical level. I'll concede that James sings very well on here, definitely his best performance since the self-titled, and the production is also noticeably better than before, but all of the various pluses this album's got going for it service some of the most boring material they've ever put out. Sure, Hardwired is not shockingly bad like St. Anger, but at least St. Anger was bad enough to be memorable and make you feel something. It's impossible to recall more than half these tracks because they're just so bland and hookless. Even Beyond Magnetic was better. Don't buy this.\n",
        "\nI go back and forth between Ride the Lightning and Kill 'Em All, the two albums that in my eyes revolutionized heavy metal. Metallica's debut brought a punk edge to metal, combining a bunch of different influences into one streamlined genre of music. The band's second effort is a fantastic leap forward in just about every way; the band makes major strides in songwriting and musicianship, the production is a little bit cleaner, the track list is more diverse, and the band is truly forging their own path here, mostly shedding the Mot\u00f6rhead and Minor Threat influences. This record encapsulates everything about Metallica's youthful energy, puts it in a time machine, and catapults it ten years into the future in terms of maturity. There are hints of Rush and early Slayer, but the band still retains some of their edgy rage.\n\nThe A-side of this record is absolutely flawless. \"Fight Fire with Fire\" opens with an acoustic intro followed by one of the heaviest, fastest, most intense riffs that Hetfield ever wrote. But this song is more than just a straightforward scorcher, there are different instrumental changeups and James's vocal performance is more of a bark to throw the song forward. The title track follows with just as much aggression but an even more complex song structure, and Kirk's solo (even if it borrows from Mustaine) is astonishing. This mammoth endeavor of guitar wizardry spans ninety minutes and numerous rhythms, climaxing in the return of the main riff to close the song out. Two tracks and about ten minutes is all that's needed to understand that Metallica would do much more than build on their seminal debut- they best-metal-band-of-all-time potential.\n\nThe controversy of this record mostly comes in the form of three songs, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\" \"Fade to Black,\" and \"Escape.\" The perceived problems with these three songs are different, but all plights are manufactured. \"Escape\" is bookended by \"Trapped Under Ice,\" a high-octane thrasher that reeks of the 'eighties, and \"Creeping Death,\" a speedy track with a chanted vocal bridge and one of the catchiest hooks and riffs the band ever wrote. \"Escape\" feels tame in comparison, but as these three tracks rip through your ears, it will feel like more like a well-timed, slower-paced interlude between two of thrash's most unrelenting songs.\n\nSimilarly, put together, the third and fourth tracks are slower and more bass-driven, but add just as much to the record as anything else here. The doom-laden, chunky riff that \"Bell Tolls\" is centered around is absolutely colossal, works incredibly well as James hauntingly yells with an icy tone about the apathy and loss of spirit that plagues soldiers who are sold off to war. This song is my personal favorite, but it serves a greater purpose to the album as a whole than on its own. It paves the road for \"Fade to Black,\" the climax of the record, to come in with precise execution. The acoustics in the intro and the chilling electric guitar solo that contrasts it nicely give way to the slow buildup of instrumentation and harmony that this song presents. Preceding an onslaught of thrashy, percussion-driven songs, \"Fade to Black\" is a thrash ballad that was truly the first of its kind for metal, combining a number of different influences in its sound and performance.\n\nThere are not many albums that sound as complete and as well-written as Ride the Lightning. Kill 'Em All may have been more influential, but it is not as conceptual as this record is, which to some may give Ride the Lightning the edge. Others may see the untapped energy of the debut to be superior to the more matured and cold sound of this sophomore LP. In my view, the two records are for all intents and purposes equal, two sides of the same coin, and the two most important albums in thrash metal history.\n",
        "\nMetallica LOOOOOOVVVVEESSSSS their live releases. From their expansive \"LiveMetallica\" series, to the release of bunches of live shows in deluxe box sets; you are in luck if you wanna get your hands on Metallica shows.\n\nSo how does this specific one stand up? Pretty well, actually.\n\nRecorded at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai, China; Metallica play a surprisingly non-standard Hardwired-era setlist. Surprisingly, though, they don't play Hardwired's title track, and instead start the set with a solid rendition of \"Breadfan\", before moving into \"Atlas, Rise!\"\n\nI don't know about anyone else but, I LOVE the drums on these 2017-2018 live recordings. Say what you want about Lars, but man, he chose good drums to play during these concerts. This is shown especially on \"Sad But True\", a song I've always thought sounded great in the drum department. James's singing here is great, mainly due to his age. He has a deeper voice nowadays then 30-35 years ago, and that adds to the more heavy melodies of Black Album songs. I understand the Black Album is a very divisive album among metalheads, but if there's one song I'd pick off it for any live setlist, it'd be Sad But True.\n\nI was surprised to see picks like \"King Nothing\" and \"Whiplash\" included in the setlist, seeing as those are... Deeper cuts then say, Enter Sandman or whatever. The rendition of King Nothing really does the song justice, while I prefer the studio version personally, James and co destroy the song live. Truly a wonder why it isn't in more sets but, what can you really do?\n\nKirk and Rob have a couple of solo's here and there (Kirk has 2 to be exact), and they work fine enough, but by the time I reach Kirk's second solo, I'm wishing for it to get through and move on to the next song. I'd much prefer a Lars drum solo or a second bass solo over 2 Kirk solos. Seeing as Kirk isn't exactly the greatest guitarist on earth, and also seeing as he likes to use the wah alot, I don't see why he was allowed 2 distinct solo's for the record. This deducts points from me, but I suppose there could've been a lot worse than that so... Maybe I should be grateful.\n\nOf course, since this concert was recorded during the Hardwired tour, they play a majority of songs off the album. Hardwired isn't exactly my favorite album so this'll also deduct points from me, as picks like \"Moth Into Flame\" and \"Halo On Fire\" really aren't that great of songs. However, I will give credit to \"Now That We're Dead\" for being one of the best songs on the record. Kirk actually does great guitar work here and James has this \"thing\" to his voice that I like. \n\nThe last thing I particularly like is James's interaction with the crowd. Call it corny if you wish, but I find it rather charming, rather... Fun, y'know? I've never been to a 'Tallica concert myself, but I imagine the interaction with the band must be fun in person. My only complaint is that it goes on a bit too long and I'd rather have them get to the songs themselves after around 3 minutes of crowd interaction. But hey, I suppose that's what a concert recording is all about, being different than the studio.\n\nWrapping up, this album is good, but nothing super special. I enjoy the setlist they played here, and I think it's worthy of a listen.\n\n...After Seattle '89, of course.\n\n-Someone who's rather grateful, and somewhat dead inside\n",
        "\nMaster of Puppets is the third installment in a trilogy of albums that built the thrash metal genre. Kill 'Em All, their first, practically invented thrash metal as a fusion of hardcore punk and speed metal. Ride the Lightning incorporated influences from Rush and Rainbow to create a more theatrical and ambitious presentation. Finally, Master of Puppets pushes the boundaries of thrash to the very border of pretentiousness, stopping just short of what would become their downfall on almost every release after.\n\nThe production on this album is very clean, arguably sterile, and dampens the sounds of the instrumentation ever so slightly. This is perhaps what saves this record from a perfect score. Because the music itself is just as strong as that of its two predecessors. Songs like \"Battery,\" \"Disposable Heroes,\" and \"Damage Inc.\" have the sheer intensity and energy that made their first album so great, while expanding the song structures to include more bridges and more wild guitar solos from Kirk. This is also the first album without a Dave Mustaine writing credit, though his influence on the band never really went away. James's riffing sounds as precise and as intricate as ever, even if his more technical performance on this album comes at the expense of the untapped rage the band harnessed earlier in their career.\n\nThis album's opus, and the best song of the band's career, comes in the form of the title track. From the steps forward the band takes in terms of songwriting and lyrical composition, to Kirk's godlike performances on both the angelic bridge and the wickedly fast solo, this is one of the most complete metal songs ever recorded. The band never lets the pace get too out of control, but it does feel fast, even if the rhythm isn't actually moving much faster than mid-tempo. James Hatfield sounds mournful as he sings about the curse of addiction and the finality of death, topics that are far more meaningful than the lyrics about \"we're Metallica!\" that percolated their first album. Everything about this song is spectacular, and even though it comes before one of the lesser songs in the track list, it still generates enough excitement for the album as a whole to be exciting.\n\n\"The Thing That Should Not Be\" is a poor man's \"Bell Tolls,\" but it still kicks ass. James sounds scary on the hook, and the chunky, chugging guitar riff is perfect for the mood the band is going for. Kirk and James's chemistry on guitar works similarly well on the gloomy \"Welcome Home,\" a track about the abuse of mental institutions that sees James making major strides in his singing. He's no longer simply shrieking, he actually pulls off some pretty good harmonies and melody on this track, and on the album as a whole.\n\nThis album is structured very similar to Ride the Lightning. Acoustic intro to begin the opening track, followed by very fast riffing. The best song on the album, the title track, coming in as the second. Then a slow thrash track, and so on. But in its own way, this album feels very distinct from RTL. There is more of a sinister approach to the lyrics, and Lars sounds like a much more competent drummer. Cliff Burton on bass also showcases some of his bass lines and performances, specifically on the epic instrumental \"Orion.\" Even one of the less-beloved cuts \"Leper Messiah\" has its own charm, in witty lyricism and a rampant pace pickup towards the back end. For how much the band would derail on future releases, and however evident the signs may have been that the direction they were heading in was not favorable, Master of Puppets remains a classic release and a testament to how grand and ambitious thrash metal can become, without crossing over into self-indulgence.\n",
        "\nYou can say what you want about Metallica now: washed, boring, bloated. But when these guys were 20 (or 19 for Lars), they kicked more ass than anybody in the world of heavy metal. Their first, Kill Em All, is the record that kickstarted the greatest genre in metal, the album that lit the flame. Sure, Exciter came six months before, but Heavy Metal Maniac pales in comparison to this beauty.\n\nNow for the music, this stuff is rough around the edges, but not in a way that makes the album feel underbaked. It gives it a youthful charm that few albums had once the technical thrash movement began taking place. Even Metallica themselves would lose touch with their unhinged, manic personas that are on full display here. When Hetfield shrieks on \"Hit the Lights\" or Kirk misses a note or two in the \"Seek and Destroy\" solo, you don't even notice because the band is playing with so much more energy than anyone else in the world. But this isn't to paint young Metallica as musical slouches either- they had the chops. The \"Phantom Lord\" riff and drum game of tag is excellent (even if Mustaine wrote it) and the \"Whiplash\" solo is one of the most underrated in all of Kirk's career. When people criticize him for overuse of the wah pedal, however justified, this album should be excluded. Even when he uses it here, it sounds fresh and exhilarating.\n\nEarly in the band's career, Metallica also had a very strong understanding of what hooks made a metal song tick. Even if Mustaine helped, this album has catchy hooks across the whole thing. \"The Four Horsemen\" does the hook better than Megadeth's \"Mechanix,\" with a steeled tone behind Hetfield's calls. \"No Remorse\" and \"Jump in the Fire\" are good examples of this, too, especially with the guitars slicing around James's singing. Perhaps it was because of the band's youth, but even when James is just shrieking his way through a hook, like on \"Hit the Lights\" or \"Metal Militia.\" There's little experimentation on the song structures here, aside from the riff transitions on \"The Four Horsemen\" or Cliff's bass solo. The band sticks to what works best in punk-fused metal: playing fast, playing loud, and not trying to sound too sophisticated. There's beauty in simplicity on albums like this, and others early in the genre.\n\nBut the real mastermind behind this seminal work is none other than Cliff Burton. It seems the rest of the band caught onto the fact that Burton was the most musically gifted of the bunch, and aptly gave him the spotlight on track four. But his bass is present and prominent throughout- it drives \"The Four Horsemen\" to being the best song on the album, but it's really the link that strings this entire album together. Every song feels complete, feels charismatic, and feels like Metallica gives a damn about how the instruments sound in the mix. They might wear the Motorhead and Maiden influences a little proudly at times, but the fact is this is THE album that changed heavy metal. Not Paranoid. Not The Number of the Beast. Not even Reign in Blood. It was Kill 'Em All\n",
        "\nLoudness War is a fucking plague. Yes, it's way worse than this COVID crap. It's been here ever since music became an element of popculture, or hell, even ealier. Companies demand their bands to sound louder than competition (as if it's a fucking race) and it hurts music that otherwise is awesome. And it's not even metal that ends up being the victim of that shit, pop artists and TV commercials are even more egregious. If you really think that 'Death Magnetic' is the only album that \"lost\" Loudness War, then do I have news for you - Slayer, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Megadeth, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Vader, Legion of the Damned, Running Wild, Grave Digger, Gamma Ray, Death Angel, Exodus, Cannibal Corpse, Dying Fetus, Motorhead, Accept - just to name a \"few\" that are constantly brickwalling their albums. And yes, you can still find declipped version from straight-from-vinyl rips or fan remasters (if someone bothers). But why would I have to do that? Why, oh why, do I have to look up some 24/192 version of albums on russian torrents to enjoy a good album without making my ears bleeding? Hell, sometimes it's not even possible - I still can't find 'Sons of the Jackal' rip that would actually had a high dynamic range. So there's also that.\n\nAnd yes, 'Death Magnetic' is indeed the best Metallica album since 86'. God, that's been so long. I mean, I can say that because after few years I finally found a declipped version that doesn't sound muddled as fuck. Sure, Guitar Hero III version doesn't make my ears bleed, but as captain Price once said: \"It's an improvement, but it's not hard to improve over garbage. Try again.\". 'Death Magnetic' doesn't only mark the return to thrash roots of the 80s, but also to the successful formula that made 'Ride' and 'Master' such an engaging experience, even for people who may not like thrash (can't blame them, lot of modern acts turned it into a parody). We start with heavy and fast opener ('That Was Just Your Life'), on track 4 we get a ballad ('The Day That Never Comes'), we receive a spiritual successor of 'Disposable Heroes' on song number 5 ('All Nightmare Long'), and last two songs are instrumental and fast violent finisher ('Suicide & Redemption' and 'My Apocalypse' respectively). But just like 'Master of Puppets', the album makes its own spin on said formula - instead of title track, on song number 2 we receive mid-paced thrasher with somber moment after solo called 'The End of the Line' (okay, I guess it is a spiritual successor of 'Master of Puppets' song), track 3 is an positive thrash 'n' heavy rumble 'Broken, Beat & Scarred' and we receive a second ballad, which is kind of tradition since infamous 'Black Album'.\n\nBut this isn't all perfect, because of course it can't be. Okay, I am a bit suprised that Lars for once can keep the tempo (or that's just editing magic), although his fills are still unimaginative. Listen to what Chris Williams from Shrapnel or Paul Bostaph can produce, how people are still making excuses for Mr. Ulrich, I have no idea. It's even worse with Kirk. Despite forgettable solo in 'That Was Just Your Life', that 'Fight Fire with Fire'-ish guitar harmonic did raise my expectations for solos. Hell, maybe they can make up for those mediocre Kirk leads with some awesome harmonies like those? But... no. The only time the leads are getting good is 'All Nightmare Long', which of course is the best song on entire album. Other downsides, aside from shitty production, would be the instrumental itself, since it has 4 riffs at best and repeats them over and over. Would have been less irritating if those riffs were actually good (like in 'Call of Ktulu').\n\nAlso, were 2 ballads really necessary? I guess a spiritual sequel to 'One' was inevitable, but was THIRD 'Unforgiven' a good idea? Sure, the piano intro is cool, and it actually sounds like next 'Unforgiven' (unlike second one), but there's a good reason why we didn't get 'Trapped Under Ice II' or 'The Last Act of Defiance II' - sometimes you simply can't capture why original was so good. Or what about 'The End of the Line', did it really had to last for 8 minutes? And what's with 'Cyanide'? It has good ideas, but they simply don't work well together.\nEDIT: Yes, I know Dave Mustaine made a sequel to 'Hangar 18' and it's actually good. Proving that it could be done right, since not only it's still sound like a second 'Hangar 18', but it also has its own identity. Meanwhile 'Unforgiven III' is just that - third rendition of 'Unforgiven'.\n\nWith all that being said, 'Death Magnetic' still marks a successful comeback to Metallica's glory days. While it plays on nostalgia quite much, I can't find other thrash or heavy metal bands that doesn't. Its biggest problem is, of course, production that apparently hates the target audience. It's good that people finally noticed there's an ongoing problem with CD releases. Too bad that they again stopped giving a shit instead of pressuring labels to treat its customers with some respect. Are metalheads really not caring about their hearing or good production?\n",
        "\nTrying to name every band that influenced Metallica's earliest sounds must be like kids naming their favorite Pokemons. \"Venom! Motorhead! Diamond Head! Discharge! Budgie! Iron Maiden! Saxon! Judas Priest! Black Sabbath! Deep Purple! Rainbow!\" The very thought of it is kinda hilarious. But how else would you even approach talking about all the influences that shaped 'Kill 'Em All' into the status it has today? Who's out there claiming himself to be a fan of thrash, death or even black metal and never in their lives have heard Metallica's nasty debut album? Well, whoever that poor man is, one day it might too late to catch up, so sit down and listen to 'Kill 'Em All', and take notes on how to play thrash.\n\nI will repeat this to the end of my life, but thrash for me is defined by its unnatural origins - a birthchild of NWOBHM, speed metal and hardcore punk. This is why I fail to see the appeal of the likes of 'Reign in Blood' or anything most of young acts drop these days, as they throw away all the influences of first two genres, which introduces melodic approach to songwriting. Because despite it's notorious status, 'Kill 'Em All' isn't fast at all time. No, no, we've got stuff like 'The Four Horsemen', which keeps the same medium tempo for 7 minutes, blasting a new riff every minute and a half, or 'Jump in the Fire' which is almost three minutes shorter and prefers to stick to two riffs at most. There's also a first Metallica's instrumental called '(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth', which is mostly Cliff Burton showcasing his skills, as well as 'No Remorse' which becomes fast only at the last minute, and a song that tends to end Metallica's shows (or used to, I don't know anymore...) - 'Seek & Destroy'.\n\nAll of these songs (most of at least - more on that later) showcases that thrash doesn't need to be at breakneck speed to be fun. But of course it doesn't mean it can't be, you just have to do it right. Songs like 'Hit the Lights', 'Motorbreath' or 'Whiplash' have been a concert-staple for years, and rightfully so - it's impossible to not have a good time while blasting these 3 songs on full volume. Just like with 'Metal Militia', or my favorite - 'Phantom Lord' with it suddenly slows down. Ah, there it is, clear Dave Mustaine's influence on 'Kill 'Em All'. He's credited as a songwriter for 4 of the songs, but I think his genius is still present throughout entire record.\n\nBut, is it a perfect thrash metal record? Well, obviously not. I won't discuss musicianship, since Kirk and Cliff joined halfway through, and Lars was never a good drummer - but his primitive drumming fits here perfectly, at least. And while James' shrieking noises were annoying at first, they grew on me. I mean, if I can stand Sean Killian or Stace McLaren, then why James Hetfield from 1983 should be any different? No, I'll discuss some other things.\n\nImagine how pissed Saxon must have been when they've heard 'Seek & Destroy', especially its section right before Kirk's solo. Metallica is lucky as fuck that Biff Byford and his band weren't as eager to get their compensation as Lars was with Napster, cause James and co. would be annihilated at the court. And so they'd be if Lynyrd Skynyrd would do the same because of 'The Four Horsemen's particular riff... I mean, granted, it was probably joke at Lars' expense (he had no idea where 'Sweet Home Alabama' riff came from), but I'm still glad Metallica doesn't play that riff live during 'The Four Horsemen' performance, because it serves no purpose to the song whatsoever. Also, am I the only one thinking that Cliff's solo on '(Anesthesia)' is too long? One minute of him showing off and band joining in would be enough. Sometimes, less is more. Not always, but sometimes. Especially since this album already takes about 51 minutes, which is... Well, a lot to take at one listen.\n\nBut I can forgive all of that, for 2 reasons. First, those riffs are only short fragments of those songs (although 'Sweet Home Alabama' riff kinda drags on...) and don't form the basis for entire songs. They could be easily cut out and both 'Four Horsemen' and 'Seek and Destroy' would still be as good as they are. And second, this was, after all, the very first thrash metal album. One could argue Exodus was the first thrash metal band, and Venom and Motorhead were the first band to play thrash. But that's not an easy debate and there can be as many arguments on both sides. What matters, is that 'Kill 'Em All' was the first record to be the embodiment of thrash metal - violent, aggressive, fast, frantic, but also melodic, slow and, dare I say, beautiful? Well, in a way, at least.\n",
        "\nWell, it seems I'm clinging to Metallica a bit too much recently. I reviewed almost all the new albums (aside from Death Magnetic) and classic records (aside from Kill 'Em All and Black Album) already, and since I really have no plan to review both Loads, one would argue I should take care of those ones I missed. I did wanted a break from Metallica, but as I stumbled across S&M recently, I knew I couldn't let it slide. And let me tell you something, metal and orchestra together aren't such a despicable idea. After all, a heavy/speed/power metal band called Rage managed to make it work. So obviously, Metallica, as a much bigger band couldn't fuck it up, right? Riiiight...?\n\nYeah, they screwed it up. Paint me shocked. But just how much they screwed up? Well, for starters, there's only 2 new songs. Wait... what? And they're not all that great to begin with. 'No Leaf Clover' sounds like a buildup to a finale that never happens in the end. Okay...? Meanwhile, 'Minus Human' is actually quite good. I mean, it takes 4 minutes up most (if we ignore the tribal-like intro) and it's based on one riff, but that's what I'm saying - have a catchy riff and make the song not waste listener's time. It's a little diamond in the rough in the sea of modern Exodus' or Iron Maiden's albums, when I just want to say: \"Just get on with it!\" like I'm in some Monty Python movie. But here's a problem, if you cut out any mention of orchestra... Nothing changes. One of the song written with orchestra in mind, sounds just the same without it. Ironic, isn't it?\n\nLet that sum up the big \"orchestra+Metallica\" debacle when S&M comes up in discussion. Now, I can't entirely blame Michael Kamen for this, since the material he got to work with is not fitting for this collaboration. I mean, were people before 1999 really asking themselves \"Jeez, I wonder how Battery or Master of Puppets would sound with an orchestra\"? No wonder they don't work, those are thrash anthems of the 80s, orchestra just sounds in them like 5th wheel in the car. Useless. It's like asking for 'The Toxic Waltz' with synths added to it (I mean, if Mick Gordon was working on it...).\n\nWhat's there, 'Enter Sandman', huh? A simple rock song that also doesn't work with symphony. Look, if I had to describe every song that doesn't work here, there's a huge chance that this site's server won't handle the data. So to say what works - first two tracks (no suprise, 'Ecstasy' comes from an old movie, and 'Call of Ktulu' is entirely instrumental), 'Nothing Else Matters', if you can stomach Lars' unnecessary and poorly timed fills, 'The Thing That Should Not Be' if James didn't sound so laughably bad, 'One', 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', intro to 'The Outlaw Torn' and maybe 'Devil's Dance'. Everything else - just no.\n\nHere's how this should have been like: pick at least one or 2 songs from each album that actually could work with orchestra, write more songs with orchestra in mind, and just play it. Or follow the route of 'XIII', 'Ghosts' or 'Speak of the Dead' by Rage and make studio recording with exclusively new material. It doesn't have to be entirely with orchestra (just like 'Speak of the Dead'), and hell, make even one or two remakes of old songs. That could work.\n",
        "\nOver the years it seems that I\u2019ve had a bone to pick with Metallica\u2019s fourth outing, \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d. Arguably Metallica\u2019s more contentious record in their classic era catalog, bar \u201cThe Black Album\u201d, I\u2019ve very much had mixed feelings about the album which I still hold to this day. I\u2019ve had a lot of things said about the record to my friends and peers, which I will attempt to recapitulate here in this review, with some comments being positive, others down right negative. And really, \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d is really all that, a mixed bag of positives and negatives, with the positives just slightly edging it out. Seeing how it seems I enjoy talking about the positives first, I think I\u2019ll keep running with that. \n\nTo start off, once more James sounds great here and out of all the production issues, which I will get to, James comes off the best mixed thing here. I mentioned in my \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d review that James\u2019s vocals have transitioned more into his gruffer approach that has become his main style, well \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d cements this into place. James here is the angriest he\u2019s ever sounded and pretty loud as the production allows him to dominate the mix for the most part. There\u2019s little of the more melodic tendencies of his voice, with \u201cOne\u201d being the exception, long gone are his shrills and screeches that were present on the first two records and a little bit of \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d. It\u2019s an overall great performance though it isn\u2019t my favorite of his as I, again beating a dead horse, views his style in \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d to be the cream of the crop for James. Both the rhythm and lead guitar sections sound very tight, as Kirk lays down some excellent solo work in songs such as \u201cEye Of The Beholder\u201d and the already mentioned \u201cOne\u201d. James still shows his skill mixing his down picking technique and the alternative picked rhythms in \u201cBlackened\u201d and \u201cHarvester Of Sorrow\u201d. \n\nThe use of social commentary is also a highlight here. Gone are the more \u201cWe are Metallica\u201d focused lyrical content, Lovecraftian worship, and the simplistic ideology about war; on here, now there is a fair amount of maturity, even more so than the last album. Ideas such as political and legal injustices, corruption, environmental issues, discrimentation and blacklisting, and the inner anguish of a wounded soldier. The only outlier would probably be \u201cDyers Eve\u201d but lyrically it\u2019s based on a rant by James to his parents so it\u2019s less non-mature and more so personal. Another positive to be had is that there is a fair amount of technical and progressive signatures. The start and stop riffing is also impressive, creating really odd and interesting riffs that sound pretty difficult to recreate. \u201cBlackened\u201d really excels at this, introducing us with a backwards and distorted guitar riff (not an acoustic intro, hooray!) building up into a fairly chaotic riff and as it progresses, mixes around harmonized dual riff soloing. All around, just a fantastic song. \n\nThat\u2019s where my positives remain and here on out it becomes much more critical and, I have to warn all of you Metallica and \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d fanboys, fairly negative. Now where should I start? Should I begin with the infamous no bass? Should I crack down the general production? Should I lambaste Lars\u2019s inconsistent drumming? Should I express my discomposure about the exceedingly long run times intermixed with drawn out and slow basic riffing with little variations in said riff or adding additional riffing to keep the songs interesting? Oh boy what should I choose! With the pettiness aside. I think the smartest vocal point would be to address the album's vexed production and move on from there. \n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice is how dry and thin everything sounds, everything from the guitars to the drums. I\u2019ve heard people try to explain how this \u201cdryness and thinness\u201d adds to the overall theme of the album but the main issue with that frame of mind is that the guitars and drums begin to lose that impact and become somewhat sterile. It feels a little powerless and if you want to deal with existential themes and more political and environmentally serious topics, wouldn\u2019t you want the heaviest sound you possibly could get? Wouldn\u2019t a song such as \u201cThe Shortest Straw\u201d sound much better and connected with its own thematic merits if it sounded like, let\u2019s say, \u201cPlaying With Spiders / Skullcrusher\u201d (don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get back to this later on as I mentioned I would in my \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d review)? \n\nSpeaking of drums being thin, dry, and overtly predominant in the mix, let\u2019s also talk about Lars. If there was one album where you\u2019d start to hear his flaws begin to truly shine, then \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d is a good starting point where it becomes pretty apparent. Lars is inconsistent, and not in a technical proggy way. No, he just can\u2019t keep rhythm which is weird for a drummer as the biggest thing for the drum section is to keep the rhythm so the guitars and bass can work with it, follow it, or play off of it. It doesn\u2019t help that his drums are fairly loud, his playing being inconsistent, and the overall sound being thin and dry and sounding like the tv box I received last month (great tv by the way). To give some credit, Lars does perform his most interesting drumming on songs \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d, \u201cFrayed Ends Of Sanity\u201d, and \u201cDyers Eve\u201d though there are some off key drum rolls and cymbal hits here and there (come on, you know I have to shit on him some more). \n\nNow if the guitars and drums sound thin and dry, and the drums are far too loud and inconsistent, what about the bass? Matter of fact, what about the musicianship of our newest bassist, Jason Newsted? Listen, we all know that we can\u2019t hear the bass in \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d, we know that. I can\u2019t say if Jason is good or bad, because we all know we can\u2019t hear it, outside small sections of the instrumental \u201cTo Live Is To Die\u201d which is the last written melodies from Cliff that the band frankensteined together. So instead of beating a dead horse saying, \u201ccan\u2019t hear bass equals bad\u201d, let me talk more about the importance of the bass. \n\nSo the simple thing about the bass is that it acts as a weave between the drumbeat, the vocalist, and the guitars. It helps reinforce melody, it helps cover beats that the drums aren't making, it helps as a link between the drums and the melody, and it can help give a sense of power to the song. So in short, it gives songs an extra dynamic or adds to its dynamics, however you describe it. We know how and why the bass was lowered in \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d but what we lost in that process was that extra dynamic and that sense of power, which would have been useful to give a better demonstration and help us feel those pesky \u201cthemes\u201d in the overall sound. James and Lars have said the bass lines follow the guitar, and obscures the rhythm section, which is the reason why the bass was dropped so low in the mix. If that is the case, why then, with all of their creativity and skill, would they write bass lines that DIDNT do that? That would have been smart but alas\u2026\n\nAnother thing to bring up is the fact that the band had a chance with these new remasters to bring up the bass but choose not to as \u201cthese albums are a reflective of their history\u201d but why not just, I don\u2019t know, issue a double disc with the newly remastered album with the bass levels raised higher AND a disc with the original albums production in tact? Ironically Jason\u2019s original band, Flotsam And Jetsam, did this with their debut \u201cDoomsday For The Deceiver\u201d offering both a remaster and the original. But that would be too much for a multimillion dollar band wouldn\u2019t it? Anyways, the lack of bass brings down the overall dynamic the music inhibits, and if the bass was audibly present, it could have helped make the guitars and drums sound a little less thin and dry. Jason truly did deserve better. \n\nI went through the production, I went through Lars\u2019s drumming, I went through the bass mix, I guess the last thing to go into is the writing and the time length. I mentioned that there was a fair amount of technical riffing and progressiveness on the record but most of the album is undercut by long time signatures that have little variation with fairly basic riff structures that become highly repetitive. Most songs range between six and a half minutes and nine and a half, with a couple ranging around five and a half minutes. Most of the time a good portion of songs become monotonous, such as \u201cEye Of The Holder\u201d, \u201cThe Shortest Straw\u201d, \u201cHarvester Of Sorrow\u201d, and \u201cThe Frayed Ends Of Sanity\u201d. There\u2019s not much in terms of rhythmic variety in regarding the main riffs and not much of additional riffs to keep the music interesting. The title track \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d, \u201cOne\u201d, and \u201cTo Live Is To Die\u201d, has a hefty amount repetitiveness but does at least try to add in a little more variations to the songs, with \u201cOne\u201d being the most effective even when the main riff goes on for far too long. \n\nThe fact that these songs are long isn\u2019t the issue, the issue is the lack of variety in terms of the main riff and additional ones. So to expand upon my comment about Overkill\u2019s \u201cPlaying With Spiders / Skullcrusher\u201d back in the \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d review I made. So I\u2019ve heard a lot of people criticize that song's length, calling it highly repetitive with not much variation as well. Well I think this a good place to compare how \u201cSkullcrusher\u201d does the whole slower, lengthy song better. In comparison, \u201cSkullcrusher\u201d has an overall better production and fully realized atmosphere, something a lot of \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d lacks. Even with its ten minute run time, \u201cSkullcrusher\u201d is able to add little variations every two and a half minutes to one minute through out, either being a small build of the the main riff, a variation of it, the change in riffs for a quicker tempo, the almost two and a half minute solo and the last couple of minutes that takes all that progress and wraps it around in a neat package for a great closing. Longer track time is effectively used to build up \u201cSkullcrusher\u201d whereas in songs like \u201cHarvester Of Sorrow\u201d and \u201cThe Shortest Straw\u201d, the main riff is dragged and dragged until you finally get to Kirk\u2019s solos and then right back into that main riff. It lacks build up, it lacks variety, and for everyone who says the album is super technical and progressive, well some of it is, but a lot of it is fairly basic. Hell, I could replace \u201cSkullcrusher\u201d with \u201cEnd Of The Line\u201d or even bring in a different band like Heathen and use \u201cHypnotized\u201d or some other band and my point would still stand.\n\nNow with all of these negative criticisms, is \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d a bad record or even a poor one. Well with all these criticisms I flushed out my toilet brain, I must surprise you with my answer, which is no. No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s far from perfect of course, far from the quality the first three records exhibit but I believe there\u2019s enough material here to warrant a \u201cgreat\u201d rating from myself, though I was extremely close to placing this album around my rankings that I would consider just a \u201cgood\u201d album. Even with this album taking issues I had with \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, , such as repetitive song structures and some simplistic riffing that was put into the forefront here, I still believe that the album is fairly catchy and memorable. There are still some impressive technical skills to hear and songs like \u201cBlackened\u201d, \u201cOne\u201d, \u201cThe Shortest Straw\u201d, and \u201cDyers Eve\u201d, which to me are the stand out tracks on the album. \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d isn\u2019t the greatest Metallica album and it isn\u2019t some fantastic ultra progressive and technical thrash album. It\u2019s a very flawed classic with a lot of ambition that doesn\u2019t fully amount to said ambition. It may be an album that I find to be fairly dull and boring but I think it is a needed record to anyone\u2019s metal collection. \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d acts as a statue to a band who was close to the end of their prime and in my point of view, the last real great or even good record Metallica would create, and after this\u2026.well\u2026.I will talk about someday in time.\n",
        "\n\u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d is an album I've had a plethora of interesting discussions about regarding its musicianship, quality, and status over the years. Just like many metalheads here today that never had the luck to grow up in the public conscious once this record was released; I was, at the very least, lucky enough to hear its contents when I was young, either hanging around my brother and father as they turned on the radio or when they inserted in an original cassette of the record. If anything, \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d (or one of their other songs from their first four, though I am certain it was \u201cMOP\u201d) I believe was my introduction to thrash metal, let alone possibly my introduction to metal in general. I remember my first time hearing \u201cBattery\u201d and being blown away from the sheer speed and intensity that I had just heard. I had never heard anything of the sort. So then I\u2019d be presented with the title track, \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, then down the line I\u2019d hear \u201cFight Fire With Fire\u201d, then \u201cOne\u201d, and so on and so forth. Little did I know that the type of music that I heard here would become one of my musical favorites and passions. \n\nOf course, as I\u2019ve gotten older and my musical knowledge proliferated and my tastes developed like ravenous breeding lagomorphs, I began to view \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d and the whole of Metallica in vairing different lights. Just as the process of aging changed my body, so did my viewpoint on this release. At one point I thought of \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d to be one of the greatest achievements in the metal genre, then at some point in time after developing parts of my palette I began to hate the record, despising it, and finally now with all of my tastes in place and my understanding deepened, my finale views of the album is in a much more positive light though with a underline critical perspective. \n\nThe best thing about \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d is its musicianship, if I really think about it. Noticeably James Hetfield's vocals have begun to transition more gruff like with his more screechy and higher pitched vocal style taking the back burner here. I believe \u201cMasters Of Puppets\u201d sets the tone that his vocals would follow here on out; with \u201cThe Black Album\u201d touring screwing up his vocals so much that he can barely hit his range here, let alone like he could on \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d. It\u2019s no doubt that James has a presence here, though I find his vocals on \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d to be superior as he juggles his higher, lower, and melodic range much more equally there compared to this record. James's truly noteworthy accomplishment is his use of his excellent hand with down picking. The title track \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d utilizes this skill for the first two rhythm patterns into the third and with the opening riff during \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d. James on the rhythmic guitar is effectively fast and precise, swinging between down picking and alternately picked sections. I noticed a lot of the times when James would down pick, it was usually used to set the tone of the song which I find to be fairly effective.\n\nLars, like usual on these early records, gets the job done but nothing spectacular. His rhythm section follows nicely along with James's rhythm section, though there could have been some more interesting drum fills in some of these songs as Lars usually employs some basic drum track or, of course, his obvious flaws as he adds random cymbal crashes in very odd places or his obvious rolling snare fill. I know a lot of people like to shit on Kirk, as do I on occasions, but Kirk presents some excellent solo work here like his frantic work transitioning into more a melodic approach on \u201cBattery\u201d, the varied shredding with some spectacular harmonics in \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, and his slow melodic crawl in \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d. Of course he has his fair share of that pesky whammy bar, like in \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d, but I don't find it to be very intrusive like it would be later on in his career. Then there is Cliff with his ever present guitar like bass following up the rest of the band. Cliff\u2019s lines are ever present here as it adds some dynamics that help the music flow along like a river running down stream and presents some memorable performances on \u201cOrion\u201d and \u201cDamage Inc.\u201d. Of course, like everyone mentions, this was his last full album that he\u2019d record, play, and write on before his horrific accident. I don't want to dwell on it as I know the story, you know the story, so there\u2019s no point in regurgitating a terrible tragedy over and over. The only thing I will say is that Cliff\u2019s talent was surely missed after this record as the writing for the bass lines hasn't had much punch or feel since the metal world lost his talent. \n\nOn the topic of things being strong, lyrically Metallica fleshes out more of their writing skills here as well. Continuing on from that focal point of social commentary, Metallica begins to delve more into other topics such as the addiction and controlling nature of drugs, mental illness and the possible view that society may be more like a sanitarium (at least something I think \u2018Welcome Home'' could mean), the idea of soldiers going into war for heroics though just being seen as expendable in reality, televangelism, and of course who could forget ol` Lovecraftian Cthulhu mythos. In comparison, this effort is much more mature and nuanced, with the exception of \u201cBattery\u201d which I believe is a song primarily based around the band itself and is lyrically much more childish in comparison. \n\nWhen it comes down to the production of this album, I find it to be fairly audible though I think it lacks more of that \u201cpunch\u201d that \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d has. I guess for example, when I compare each of the title tracks, \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d and \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, I notice the guitars feel a little more dialed back in \u201cMaster\u201d than it is in \u201cRide\u201d. I believe that \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d does achieve to make the vocals and instruments a little more clearer, with the bass having just a little less distortion, but with that achievement I find the overall \u201ccrunchiness\u201d of the bass to be lessened and the homogenous between the players is a pinch lost. Not saying the record sounds bad or lacks any dynamics or punch to the overall sound, I just don\u2019t find it equal in quality to the previous record's production. \n\nI guess I can now finally really get into my more \u201ccritical\u201d side and address the elephant in the room. This isn't Metallica\u2019s greatest achievement, nor is it thrash metals or the whole metal genre as a whole. Listen, \u201cMaster Of Puppets' ' is a fantastic album and not deserving of scores like 0%, 5%, 25%, or 63% nor does it deserve a perfect 100% score like some have issued. As I\u2019ve viewed, the public seems to skip over the fact that \u201cMaster Of Puppets'' is effectively just \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d part 2 with added fluff, repetitiveness and simple riffing. Practically everything that made \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d such a great record is here, a thrashy opener that starts with an acoustic beginning section (\u201cBattery\u201d-\u201dFight Fire With Fire\u201d), a ballad (\u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d-\u201dFade To Black\u201d), a slower building doom like song (\u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d-\u201dFor Whom The Bell Tolls\u201d), a instrumental (\u201cOrion\u201d-\u201dThe Call Of Ktulu\u201d), and the rest of the album being mid-tempo songs (you know what they are and you get my point). Now you\u2019re probably wondering \u201cif \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d is practically just \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d part 2, why isn\u2019t it also getting a 100% like you did with the previous album?\u201d. \n\nThe biggest issues comes down to the repetitive and simple nature a portion of the record exemplifies and in turn, time signatures are extended creating what feels to be what I call \u201cmusical fluff\u201d. To give a comparison, most of \u201cRide The Lightning\u2019s\u201d songs average between four and five minutes while having a couple of songs around six minutes and the instrumental at almost nine. Now with \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, almost half the songs average between six to eight minutes with three coming to around the five and a half minute mark. Now \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d having longer songs isn\u2019t the issue, it\u2019s what the band decides to do with them. For a good portion of songs, such as \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d, \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d, \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d, and especially \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d. For a good portion of these songs, a lot of time rides on the main riff with very little additional riffs and minimal variations to the main riff. Even a song such as \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d does this to an extent, though it comes off more successful as other variations of the main riff and the changing to other riffs are much more common. Not to mention that some of these riffs that take up half and even three fourths of the runtime can be fairly basic and simple in structure, you end up with songs feeling somewhat bogged down and dull. On a side note, I also don\u2019t believe \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d to be a fairly well employed doom like song, and prefer the previously mentioned \u201cFor Whom The Bells Toll\u201d or even something like Overkill\u2019s \u201cPlaying With Spiders / Skullcrusher\u201d, which is a comparison I will go on in much greater detail in my \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d review. \n\nI\u2019ve heard people give excuses for the length of the songs, saying it adds to the \u201cprogressiveness\u201d that the album has, or makes the songs more \u201cepic\u201d but having songs being fairly repetitive and simple does NOT add to any type of progressive nature or create a sense of epicness. The issue is a lot of these songs take advantage of these long run times but doesn\u2019t really add anything to give reason for said longer time signatures. I don\u2019t think these songs are bad, far from it as I believe they have some very memorable riffing and there is a fair amount of progressive moments and technical ability, it\u2019s just undercut with some repetitive and at times, simple riffing that brings it down a little. Some also say that this is an album with the perfect balance between the furious power of thrash metal and retaining a more public acceptability or marketability. Even if that was the case, something being easier for the masses to digest isn't a signal of quality and acts more as a straw man to justify more simple music structures and repetitiveness. \n\nIs \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d a bad record? The downfall of thrash? The downfall of metal in general? These questions I can answer with a simple no. And I can answer no once again to those who ask if this is the best thrash record ever or the best metal record either. No, it is not bad nor is it the greatest, though I can say it \u201cis\u201d one of the greatest. It is not a record I\u2019d say is in the top ten thrash metal albums ever nor in the top twenty, but possibly somewhere in the thirties or even forties. For \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d the pros outway the cons though those cons are noticeable and only add up towards their next release. It is a fantastic release, with a good variety of progressive and technical progressions and structures but at the same does have some poorer aspects such as repetitiveness, some fairly basic riff structures, and long run times that can feel kind of wary and dull. I don\u2019t find \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d to be a masterpiece, as it doesn\u2019t really achieve anything new and falls in the true masterpieces shadow, \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d, but it does offer a very memorable and enjoyable experience and really, what\u2019s wrong with that?\n",
        "\nI used to listen to Death Magnetic a lot in 2016 and I have a lot of good memories about it. That year was absolutely awful, and music was one of my few ways of escaping reality. For that reason, I may be a little biased towards it, and I may downplay some of its issues \u2013 the biggest problem (brace yourselves) is not the production, it\u2019s just that the music is not very interesting, and at times, it even becomes frustrating. In Chile, we have a saying \u2013 \u201cit lacks a gram to really be a kilo\u201d. That\u2019s how this album feels sometimes. There\u2019s nothing detestable or indignantly shitty on it \u2013 it\u2019s just that there are very little moments in which I can imagine myself listening to it for any reason other than nostalgia. I guess Vektor\u2019s \u201cTerminal Redux\u201d set the bar impossibly high, but that\u2019s a story for another day.\n\nMetallica is a group of evidently talented musicians. I don\u2019t find \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d to be as fantastic as most people think it is (I prefer \u201c\u2026and Justice For All\u201d), but I do acknowledge the fact that it is HUGELY influential, and most importantly, exceptionally creative and technical (Orion inspired me to pick up the guitar, after all). It is for this reason that I find Death Magnetic slightly irritating. The entire album feels rushed, even though it obviously wasn\u2019t - I estimate that its writing took at least three or four years. I don\u2019t wish to suggest that the riffing or the songwriting is underdeveloped or lazy; it\u2019s just that Metallica can blatantly come up with something much more captivating and attention-grabbing.\n\nI don\u2019t think the production is a sonic abortion as many fans and outsiders alike seem to think it is. In fact, I find it decent \u2013 the guitars pack a heavy punch, the bass is sufficiently loud, and the drums are clear and crisp. What does perplex me is that the most popular and successful metal band of all time just cannot get their records produced well. The aforementioned \u201c\u2026and Justice For All\u201d is too dry and trebly, \u201cSt. Anger\u201d is \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, and this one is unfortunately TOO LOUD. I don\u2019t mean that in a literal sense; I\u2019m listening to Death Magnetic at full volume as I write this, and I almost wish I could turn it up a tiny bit louder. I mean that whenever the band plays harshly or intensely (metal, anyone?) the sound becomes distorted as hell. Take literally any song off this record, listen to it, and you\u2019ll realize that the sound is bafflingly inconsistent \u2013 everything is relatively normal, but when Lars hits a crash cymbal or James strums a power chord at the end of a riff, the grittiness of the sound will simply give you a headache. There\u2019s a section on \u201cAll Nightmare Long\u201d (\u2018cause we hunt you down without mercy!) where Lars continually rides on one of his crash cymbals, and I find that section to be a perfect example of what I\u2019m talking about: the music gets more and more warped with every crash cymbal hit. Hell, even the intro shows this contrast \u2013 it begins with an acoustic guitar, and when the overdriven guitars come in, it all transforms into static.\n\nMany people refer to the fact that the songs are \u201creally long\u201d. Well, they objectively are \u2013 the average song on this album is seven minutes long, and the instrumental track \u201cSuicide & Redemption\u201d is the most prolonged original song Metallica has ever recorded. However, I don\u2019t find that to be something negative; the songs naturally evolve and develop through their running time. It feels like Metallica didn\u2019t make these songs as long as they are for the sake of progressiveness or technicality; they simply are extensive because there are a lot of different ideas going on here, and it takes some time for them to flourish.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t refer to this as a pure thrash album. Sure, \u201cThat Was Just Your Life\u201d is undiluted thrash, and the influences (it is very weird to talk of \u201cinfluences\u201d when referring to a band that helped establish the style) of said genre are undeniably present throughout the entire record, but the rest of it is simply heavy metal with a lot of 90\u2019s-style groove thrown into it. \u201cThe Unforgiven III\u201d is definitely the most evident display of experimentation here. It begins with a symphonic/acoustic passage and features a buildup (which is regrettably underwhelming) at around the five-minute mark. It\u2019s the softest song on the album, and it works for that exact same reason \u2013 it\u2019s unmistakably emotional. The vocal melodies during the main verses legitimately invoke sorrow and a devastating sense of bitterness and resentment. It\u2019s not really enjoyable, but it works as a cog in the machine, so to speak. The riffs on \u201cSuicide & Redemption\u201d get seriously close to nu-metal territory with their heavy, rhythmic, and percussive qualities. The melodic interlude on that one does sound quite rushed \u2013 it\u2019s simply boring, but I guess you must have a melodic interlude on a 10-minute song for the sake of variety.\n\nI almost always listen to the albums I\u2019m reviewing as I write, and in an intentionally inflammatory way, I expected this record to be more underwhelming and disappointing than I remembered (like I said in the beginning, it\u2019s been a few years since I listened to it carefully). I have to say that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised \u2013 it is an assuredly competent record. Sure, there\u2019s a LOT of music out there that\u2019s simply more memorable and congenial than this, but you could say the same thing about most art, couldn\u2019t you?\n",
        "\nAs I am getting back my euthanism and feeling a sense of obligation to continue creating reviews, I thought the best way to get myself back into a serious mood was by pressing myself into a formidable record that everyone and their mother has reviewed already; Metallica`s Magnum Opus, \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d. Arguably one of the best, if not the best in many metal kins minds, thrash metal records to ever exist. I`m not really sure how I want to start this off so I'll drop the formalities and express that I believe \u201cRide The Lightning'' is Metallica`s finest moment, and only goes downhill from here. Yes, there are plenty of debates and conversation pieces regarding the question, \"what is Metallica's best record?\u201d but I feel very certain of my opinion that I am indeed correct. As I go down the Metallica iceberg, diving deeper and deeper in the already explored waters, you`ll understand my point of view. The only way to even begin this trip is to start from the very beginning. \n\nPiggy backing off the considerable success of their debut, \u201cKill `Em All\u201d, \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d employs a better sense of variety in terms of tempo, song / rhythmic structure, and performances compared to their debut. That is not to say that their debut had poor writing or performances, merely it takes the best of what \u201cKill `Em All\u201d has, refines it, mixes in new ideas that are also fairly refined, and creates this concoction. Not one ounce of aggression and speed is lost on this sophomore outing as songs such as the apocalyptic \u201cFight Fire With Fire\u201d and the relentless \u201cTrapped Under Ice\u201d still deliver thrashy energy we are all accustomed too but not every song follows the \u201cballs to the wall thrash\u201d approach the last record mostly dwelled in. No, Metallica got to toy around more with tempo and rhythmic changes, offering the listener more musical avenues that weren't already present. \u201cFade To Black\u201d is probably the most notable as it was Metallica's first, and certainly not the last, dabble in ballads yet it is adequately made utilizing the use of the acoustic guitar sections and a slower tempo to create a sorrowful feeling all throughout it. Noticeably, the rest of the record is surrounded in mid-tempo thrashers like \u201cCreeping Death\u201d, \u201cFor Whom The Bell Tolls\u201d, and well you know the others, which allows the band to showcase their skill behind both the instrument and the pen and paper, offering the listener intricate back and forth riffing while keeping a catchy cohesiveness to the song's structure. Yet again the band manages another instrumental with \u201cThe Call Of Ktulu\u201d that is also another song that is placed in a mid-paced tempo but fully employs its long eight minute and fifty-three second run time by superbly interchanging between riff to riff acting as a fantastic closer to the album. On top of the bands refinements in the instrumental department, the lyrical content is considerably grown up from the previous record as songs are sung about the horrors of nuclear warfare and war in general, capital punishment, the ten plagues brought upon Egypt, suicide, and other topics that may be left up the listener. \n\nSpeaking of songs being sung, James Hetfield has really come out of his shell here and put on one of his most memorable performances, and my personal favorite. James employs more melody and technique than his outright screeches and yells found on the debut but still has that same snarl and aggression that he became well known for. It is balanced in all intended purposes, as songs like \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d and \u201cFade To Black\u201d is a fantastic showcase as he juggles both hand in hand, never missing a catch. Lars is at the top of his game, offering a varied performance helping keep the flow of the song's rhythmic structure while giving us some interesting fills. Kirk is a great counterpart to James rhythm guitar playing, providing intricate dual harmonies and busting out solos left and right with precision and skill. The application of harmony that Kirk employs, in the solo sections like in the title track \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d, help elevate the rest of the music as it progresses and those solos are really top tier in themselves. All this focus on harmony, melody, and tempo structure has major thanks to Cliff Burton who taught the rest of the band, though Kirk had some knowledge thanks to his teachings with Joe Satriani, about the importance of learning music theory. Cliff`s style of bass playing always came off more like him playing the part of a third guitarist than a bassist, with songs like \u201cEscape\u201d and \u201cThe Call Of Ktulu\u201d being prime examples; or really just the whole album in general. \n\nProduction wise I'm fairly certain is near perfect. Sure, someone random joe could take some issues that don't really amount to much but I don't hear the possible criticisms when I listen to the record. There's just a weight surrounding the mix, as the guitars are fairly heavy and punchy and the bass has a nice crunch to it. Lars drumming isn't over burdening and the same can be said about James vocals in the mix. Everything is audible and dynamic, allowing us to take every inch of the instrumentation and vocal performance without missing a beat. I can\u2019t at all find any issues with the production and I have yet to read a good case saying so. \n\nEven with those detractors complaining about songs like \u201cFade To Black\u201d being a ballad on a thrash record or \u201cEscape\u201d as it was a last minute song after requests from the record company wanting a single that was more \u201cradio friendly\u201d, \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d stands as a tall achievement in the thrash metal genre. The album flows almost perfectly and every song fits as if each were a piece to a puzzle, especially \u201cEscape\u201d as I don't really see any issues with it at all. People like to throw words such as iconic, memorable, quintessential, masterpiece, and a plethora of words that act as synonyms to one another without any real critical thought or understanding when using those words but in this case with \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d, it is wholeheartedly true. So why do I believe that \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d is the best record Metallica has put out, even in the face of albums like \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d and \u201c...And Justice For All\u201d? The thing about \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d is that it isn't bogged down by simple repetitive riffs with track run times running much longer than they should, something I like to call, \u201cmusical fluff\u201d. \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d is technical, progressive, emotional, and to the point and never overstays its welcome, unlike parts of \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d and a large portion of \u201c...And Justice For All\u201d (which I will talk about in their respective reviews). Sure, \u201cMOP\u201d and \u201cAJFA'' might have songs that are just a bit more technical and progressive but they are surrounded by a layer of repetitiveness that can feel like a chore, especially with \u201cAJFA\u201d. No, \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d doesn't have that issue nor anything that I can view as major. \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d is everything that Metallica was doing right at the time, and as a high, it's something they could never reach again.\n",
        "\nAs yes, the infamous Napster leak of \"I Disappear\". This was the track that got the attention of the band and especially got Lars freaked out, leading to him and his lawyer namedropping 300,000 users that downloaded the song and got them banned, as well as pretty much killing Napster in the process. This controversial move has since been subsided, especially with the later release of the infamous \"St. Anger\" album, and just recently, this leaked track was given an official release as a demo. I won't go into too much details about the song itself, but rather, I'll offer a retrospective view of the leaked track and how well it aged.\n\nThe first side of the record is the leaked demo itself. This does have the feel of an amateur recording, as you can hear some talking at the beginning right before the song starts. Despite that, the production does feel a bit cleaner compared to earlier renditions. The guitar riffs have a more crisp sound in them, and the sound they bring in sounds more clear and stronger. The drums do feel a bit weak though, as they sound muffled from the mix. Even the bass is given more attention, as its sound is more prominent in the mix and provides a good foundation to the song. As for Hetfield's vocals, it's pretty decent. His voice has a certain energy in them that gives him an upbeat personality, and his flow works well to the technical composition of the songs. While the recording itself is a bit cheap, the production has been polished in this release, and it makes the overall sound of the track feel better than the earlier versions.\n\nThis release also contains a bonus track, which is a live version of the song that took place in a concert in West Hollywood in 2000. As for this song, it's pretty good as well. The guitars have a more powerful sound in it, and its increase in distortion gives it a more raging tone. The drums are also better mixed in than in the leak, as the beats are given a more vibrant sound and sets up the tempo better. The bass, however, sounds a bit quiet, and doesn't play the best bass riffs. James's vocals are also good, as his vocals are given more reverb and he sounds more aggressive than in other versions, though I don't like his vocals in the latter half of the song, as his screaming of \"I'M GONE!\" sounds a bit childish. This live track is good overall, and is one of the better live tracks in the band's extensive live catalog.\n\nOverall, this release was pretty good. The leaked version of the sound has better production, but still has that rough sound to emulate the original leak. The live version is also just as good, even when Hetfield's vocals end up declining a bit as the song goes on. This is far from the best release from Metallica, but if you're looking to hear a part of Metallica's infamous side of history, then I recommend you give this demo a spin.\n",
        "\nDeath of Cliff Burton was a tragic event. As one of the few bassists who had such big creative input into a band like Metallica, it's even sadder to think how much he could still contribute to metal music. Everytime an important member of the band goes away - like David Lee Roth with Van Halen - some part of band's charm goes away. Sometimes forever. And it was definitely a case for Metallica, as follow up to majestic and grim 'Master of Puppets' turned out to be such a troubled album.\n\nTo put it this way, '...And Justice for All', despite having good basis for a great album, falls flat on its face in almost every aspect. First one is the production. The guitars sound extremely dry and thin. Lack of bass has basically become a meme, but you don't just hire Jason Newsted to completely mute him in final mix. And to everyone who thinks he's a shitty bassist - just listen to 'Doomsday for the Deceiver' by Flotsam and Jetsam. First opening seconds of 6-minute thrashing fun 'Hammerhead' is more than enough to solidify his position in metal world. I have no idea what Lars and James were thinking when they cut Jason's lines off. And those drums... While 'St. Anger' snare is also a meme now, 'Justice's drums sound is really not better. It's like if Lars decided to replace his kit with a bunch of cardboard boxes borrowed to him by Big Boss himself. It lacks punch, it also sounds dry and weak. And adding lack of bass guitar in the mix, it really goes against any heaviness this album could have. Only James' vocals are fairly on point - he's audible enough in the mix and his delievery is quite powerful for what the songs are trying to achieve. If it wasn't for poor perfomances, any live versions of those songs would be much better.\n\nBut this is where problem number two appears, the songwriting itself. This is, I think, the first instance of what I'm calling 'pseudo-prog', which is also played by modern Iron Maiden and Exodus - that being, the songs that could easily take around 4, 5, or 6 minutes at most, repeats riffs and adds unnecessary sections going nowhere, making those songs take... 10 minutes. And yes, there are good songs made by those and other bands that lasts for longer. I mean, Heathen's discography is filled with massively long songs. But Heathen, before becoming another Exodus, was able to fill those songs with great hooks and interesting sections, and drumming was much better than that of Metallica's.\n\nTo give it credit, the album starts out alright, 'Blackened' is a good opener, but I'm still sick to death of hearing it because of its inclusion in every single live album. Its bridge section is also unnecessarily repeated. If you would cut it in half, it'd be better, but it's still not as good as previous albums' openings. 'The Shortest Straw' is actually quite a good song that could easily find its place on previous two albums, if only the sound wasn't so powerless. I mean, both 'Lightning' and 'Master' are perfect as they are, but if you would replace 'Creeping Death' or 'Disposable Heroes' with 'Shortest Straw', I don't think I'd be mad about it. 'Dyers Eve' is basically this album's 'Damage, Inc.', ridiculously fast finale finishing the album on strong note. Yeah, not really. I don't know, for me it just sounds way too standard to justify its placement in tracklist. While 'To Live is to Die' has its problems, I think it'd suit better if the instrumental was closing this album. Well, that, and 'Dyers Eve' is just not really good. Something about those riffs rubs me in a wrong way.\n\nThose would wrap up faster bits of this album. But it's not like there's nothing else there, it's just buried in unncessary repeats. Title track is the prime example of this, this song really has no reason to last for almost 10 minutes. This song could've been played faster, like, let's say, on show that would be a basis for 'Through the Never' movie soundtrack. Just with better drumming, of course. If you're gonna keep it in the same tempo for its entire runtime, you might as well just make it faster and less boring. Also, its \"post-solo\" section could've been axed in half. And may I just ask, what's the deal with 'Eye of the Beholder'? Aside from intro there's really no good riffs or hooks to justify its existence. But no, 'Escape' is what James is ashamed of. And of course, the big one (ha ha...), 'One'. Its second half is nice, but, just like 'Blackened', this song is so overplayed live, I can't stand it anymore.\n\nMeanwhile, 'Harvester of Sorrow' is shorter, and because of that, it's better than some songs here. Both 'The Frayed Ends of Sanity' and 'To Live is to Die' have good riffs and hooks, but are unnecessarily dragged-out, losing their potential in the process. And it's a shame, because after Cliff's death, Metallica more than ever had to prove to the world they're still on the top of the game. But the truth is, they weren't anymore. This album, unlike some wants to claim, is no deeper than 'Kill 'Em All'. And while some of KEA's fault can be forgiven because of its primitive nature and the fact that it's the one that started it all, AJFA cannot warrant the same justification.\n\nI could also add something about tracklist, but I really don't think changing tracklist would make this album significantly better. It's just wasted potential.\n",
        "\nAh Metallica... probably as loved in the metal community as hated. Say what you want about these LA thrash legends but they sure know how create controversy. Started of as a barnstorming thrash metal machine, they helped reshaping the climate of heavy metal with all time-classics like \"Ride The Lightning\" and \"Master Of Puppets\". For many people (including me), their first 4-5 albums worked as a gateway into heavy metal, and I think it's safe to say that most of us at least owe James, Lars, Kirk, Cliff, Jason and Robert something for introducing us to heavier music.\n\nDespite that, I think most of us can agree that Metallica has made some questionable decisions over the course of their soon to be 40-year old career. Starting with The Black Album in 1991, they started to incorporate more commercial elements to their music. This was a decision that still to this day divides their fanbase. No one can argue the importance of The Black Album. It made the general public aware of Metallica and broadened the general interest for heavy metal music. Many of the songs from the album are still being played to death on the radio and the album still remains one of the best-selling heavy metal albums of all time. However... for their longtime fans, The Black Album signaled a stylistic change that many weren't satisifed with. Terms like \"posers\" and \"sell-outs\" became more and more appearent, and that's a stamp that Metallica has lived with ever since. \n\nIt wasn't unjustified though. While The Black Album marked the beginning of their commercialization, it still had a lot of heavier elements and can at least be classified as a heavy metal album. It was with their following albums that their commercial approach really became obvious. With albums like \"Load\" and \"ReLoad\", Metallica started to incorporate styles that was popular at the time into their music, writing songs that stretched from blues to alternative rock to country. If the commercialization of the band wasn't obvious with The Black Album it definitely was now. The nail in the coffin then came when they released St Anger in 2002, one of the most controversial, infamous (and IMO worst) albums in heavy metal history. Metallica was really down the tubes at that time, and after sorting out their internal conflicts and personal issues, it was very pleasant to see this album, Death Magnetic, arrive in 2008.\n\nTo me this albums signals the comeback of Metallica. For the first time in years the band feels fresh, motivated and creative. This is in many ways a return to their thrash roots, containing songs that are fast, heavy, long and fairly advanced. It is filled to the core with memorable riffs, fantastic lead work from James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett and great songwriting. I know many longtime fans don't like this album and I can't understand why. This is in many ways a return to the style of music that they were playing in the ...And Justice For All days, and if this album had been released directly after that album, it would have felt like a natural musical step. I consider Death Magnetic to be the delayed follow-up to ...And Justice For All. \n\nSongs like \"That Was Just Your Life\", \"The End Of The Line\", \"Broken, Beat & Scarred\" and \"All Nightmare Long\" delivers one great riff after another and gives me a feel of strength and motivation that I haven't got from this band since at least The Black Album. Finally Metallica makes me want to go out and lift a mountain again! You also get the obligatory power-ballad, \"The Day That Never Comes\", as track nr 4 and a streched out instrumental in \"Suicide & Redemtion\", which showcase the more creative and emotional side of Metallica. The fact that you get stuff like this really signals that this is a band returning to their roots since this were things that characterized their first 4-5 albums.\n\nThe albums isn't without it's flaws though. Some of the songs can drag a little bit more than what is justified. If songs like \"Suicide & Redemtion\", \"The End Of The Line\" and \"The Judas Kiss\", as great as they are, were trimmed down by 1-2-3 minutes, they would have left an even bigger impact and made the album even better. The most obvious problem is the production though. This album has been called a \"loundess war\" and rightfully so. The mix is very undynamic and compressed, making the album sound like a loud, disjointed mess. It's in fact very amateurish and that's a real shame. Considering how great the songs are, they definitely deserved a more professional and dynamic prodcution. \n\nDespite the obvious production flaws and the fact that some of the songs could have been trimmed down a bit, Death Magnetic is still a very strong album that for me signaled the comeback of Metallica as we want them. The fact that some people don't like this album makes me feel that some people are very thick-headed and that the sour taste of Load, ReLoad and St. Anger still plauges ther mouths. This album doesn't deserve to be shitted on other than for the production. Except for that, this album is mostly stellar.\n",
        "\n'Master of Puppets', Metallica's most beloved record, proves two things. One, the formula of tracklist for 'Ride the Lightning' was a success, and two, don't completely fix what ain't broken. At that point in time, there's really nothing else to add about this album or band itself, since a lot of other reviews probably beat that horse to death already. So, I'll just keep my discussion brief, showing yet again why tracklist is so important in metal music, especially thrash.\n\nThis album's first song, just like last time starts off slow, with acoustic guitars setting a tone. 40 seconds in and the acoustics are thrown out in favor of electric guitars, continuing the dual riff. And after that, 'Battery' kicks off with the same amount of energy like 'Fight Fire with Fire'. The rest of the album almost completely follows the formula that make 'Ride the Lightning' work so well - the iconic gritty title track setting dark mood, 'The Thing That Should Not Be' further cementing the gritty atmosphere, although the song itself may come off a bit monotonous, a ballad that is also a tribute to metal legends (first seconds are reminscent 'Neon Nights' of Accept, guitar work in second half has a lot of Iron Maiden vibe), 8-minute titan 'Disposable Heroes' and more classic heavy metal-oriented 'Leper Messiah'.\n\nThere are few changes to the formula, however. 'Master of Puppets' (the song) for example, doesn't have a dramatic outburst of speed, like 'Ride the Lightning' (the song) had in second part of the solo - it's quite opposite situation, actually. 'Disposable Heroes' isn't a lighthearted fun song that was 'Trapped Under Ice' [talking music excusively, not the lyrics], but a much more complex and gritty colossus. But it's really the ending that flips the formula on its head. Instead of epic mid-paced thrasher and grant instrumental we get... slow and heavy instrumental, which is also entirely a child of Cliff Burton, and fast-pace apocalypse, 'Orion' and 'Damage Inc.' respectively. And that's great, cause it'd be kind of dumb to finish such a fantastic album on 'Orion', no matter how great is to hear Cliff's creative input for the last time.\n\nAnd all I can say is, all those changes to RtL's tracklist formula are very welcomed, especially since the songs themselves are not (mostly) repeats from last album. I can't imagine 'Disposable Heroes' being a start of this whole thing, even if it's a great song. It's also kind of brilliant of this quartet to put 'The Thing That Should Not Be' so early, otherwise it would probably come as much more forgettable. Like I said when reviewing 'Ride the Lightning' - a great tracklist like this can complement all the songs even if their quality is not always spot on.\n\nReading through the reviews here makes me think that a lot of metal fans probably don't like to think too critically about the media they enjoy. While it's not a bad thing to mention the brilliant song writing or tight musicianship, the fact that out of 37 or so reviews only one man named \"bayern\" has anything to say about the tracklist - not exactly in positive light, but hey, that's his opinion - makes me speechless. The rest, more or less, just repeats the well-known by everyone points why this album is the greatest/worst thing ever. It's fine to read about first 2 or 3 times, but almost every review is basically the same - either it's \"there's only 2/3 thrash songs, it's not thrash album!\" or \"songs are awesome\". Maybe it's about time we start taking more in-depth look on album we listen to, realize what makes them truly awesome and separate them from albums that sound \"awesome\" only on the surface level. And yes, I am also talking about 'Reign in Blood', but I've already covered that one as well.\n",
        "\nMetallica, Slayer, Megadeth & Anthrax, the Big Four of Thrash Metal!... Ha, good one. That's the funniest shit I've seen since seeing Kong shoving a tree down Godzilla's throat (or an axe, if you've seen their latest rematch). Honestly, as of right now, only Megadeth seems to still fit the part of this whole \"idea\", as Slayer doesn't exist anymore, Metallica only scratches the surface of thrash and so does Anthrax. But hey, they apparently sell the biggest number of records, unlike other bands being much closer to thrash, like Death Angel, Overkill, Testament or Exodus, so it makes sense, I guess...? Whatever this marketing crap is, the idea of this four bands uniting for making a tour around the world was born. And it ended up in recording this DVD, which I manage to bought some long time ago. However, I feel like I could spent that money on buying an actual good DVD, if other bands like Overkill or Death Angel were more open to the idea of fucking doing them.\n\nChronologically, I should start with Anthrax, but I prefer to start from Slayer. \"Fucking Slayer\" (or \"SLAYER, kurwa!\" from where I come from), I always cringe when I hear that chant. It makes me feel like those people have no idea that thrash needs more than aggression and speed to be great. While it could seem like I hate Slayer - no, not really. When they actually put some effort, they really can produce some relatively good music, as shown with 'Show No Mercy', 'Hell Awaits' (which are two albums completely overlooked on this show - what are the odds!), 'South of Heaven', 'Seasons in the Abyss' and even 'God Hates Us All'. It's mostly the cult following of 'Reign in Blood' that really gets under my nerves, because this album only has hollow aggression and speed to offer. And nothing else. But that didin't stopped metalheads from calling it \"magnum opus\" of thrash and compare every competent album to this mediocrity. But that's a story for another time.\n\nHonestly, this show is really weak. Not only the setlist sucks, offering very little variety out of Slayer's entire catalogue (it's mostly the big hits from 'Reing In Blood', 'South of Heaven' and 'Seasons in the Abyss', with three song from then-latest release 'World Painted Blood', 'Disciple' from 'God Hates Us All' and 'Jihad' from 'Christ Illusion'), but the song performances are also lacking punch. Hannemann and King were never anything special, but now they've really set the bar to the new low. Solos feel sloppy, as if playing those songs thousand times wasn't enough. I guess it's a nice thing to see Slayer in the iconic OG line-up before Jeff passed away, but to be honest, these guys are/were past their prime. Well, most of them, because Dave Lombardo is Dave Lombardo and Dave Lombardo is fucking awesome. Even if Slayer's music doesn't give him much of a room to vary his playstyle. Arguably, the lowest point of this show is Tom Araya. His vocals are just a pain to listen to. At some moments he sound like he's struggling for breath. Maybe he should have taken some vocal lessons to learn how to utilize your energy during singing better. Hell, maybe that would let him do the proper high-pitched screams again. \n\nAnother problem is the sound, which is quite muddy. While on 'Vile' by Cannibal Corpse it works for album's atmosphere, here it's just annoying. Live perfomances for me should sound clean enough to hear every member doing their work. Only drums sounds a bit passable, while King's guitar seem to overpower Hannemann's guitar in the mix, and Tom Araya seems to be completely lost, both vocally and with bass guitar. For better or worse, it's perhaps a good thing Slayer ended their career. Araya seems happy with retirement, King can play his horrible solos elsewhere (which I pity to whoever decides to join his new pet project) and Lombardo provides his skills for Suicidal Tendencies and Philm. Overall, I rate it around 35%. Too much bullshit for me to recommend. 'Decade of Aggression' is much likely a better choice.\n\nNext in the list, Anthrax. And again, it's pretty \"meh\". The musicianship is much tighter than Slayer, though. And as long as Charlie Benante isn't allowed anywhere close to 'Fast as a Shark' by Accept, I'll take him. But there are two things dragging this show down. First, setlist. I'll just gonna ask, where is 'Among the Living' (the song)? Where's 'A.I.R.'? Or 'Gung-Ho'? Or anything from 'Persistence of Time'? You had the time to play a song from much rather despised John Bush era, but nothing from 5th album? Not even a cheesy 'Belly of the Beast'? I guess that Joe Jackson cover of 'Got the Time' is the representative of 'Persistence of Time', but I'll rather have an original song here.\n\nBut even with better setlist the show would still be disappointing, because Joey Belladonna can't sing to save his life anymore. While the band seem to have a lot of fun performing the songs, Belladona drags the entire show down. In the 80s he may seemed a little bit like Bruce Dickinson knock-off, here it's even more evident, since his vocals downgraded just as much as Bruce's. It's again painful to listen, especially during 'Heaven and Hell' cover. Sorry Joey, but Mark Osegueda is the only one who can fucking nail this song. And again, Belladonna is struggling to keep his breath during singing a lot of times. And people have balls to say they're the best of out the 4. Yeah, fuck no.\n\nOne advantage they have over the rest is sound, which is clean, and sleak, and exactly how a modern live show should fucking sound like! It's right there with first part of 'The World is Ours' by Motorhead, 'Dark Roots of Thrash' by Testament or both Metallica's DVD from year prior. The drums have enough punch in them, the bass is audible, and guitars are just perfect. The only complaint is Belladona's voice being a bit hidden in the mix, although that might be a good thing... Overall, 50%. The musicianship and sound can't save a show with this disgraceful vocal performance. And to think I used to say this show was the best. What a joke. Get yourselves a copy of 'Alive 2', it's a much better Anthrax expierience with Belladonna that doesn't sound like a watered down version of modern Bruce Dickinson. Who already is a watered down version of classic Bruce, which is... Yikes.\n\nOkay then, Metallica. The biggest out of 4, the most recongizable, and of course have to put out the biggest and longest show. Well, I'm not so sure about that. Problem one, the setlist became way too formulaic at the time. We start with 'Creeping Death', so of course it only makes sense to follow-up with 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', correct that with 'Fuel' and a forgotten gem from 'Ride the Lightning' or '...And Justice for All', a ballad (at least 'One' appears much later on), a 'Death Magnetic' song (it's not 'Broken, Beat & Scarred', thank God), followed up by 'Cyanide', 'Sad But True', another ballad, 'All Nightmare Long', ANOTHER BALLAD, 'Master of Puppets', thrashy song with intro (and it's not overlooked 'Fight Fire With Fire' or 'Battery'), duo 'Nothing Else Matters' and 'Enter Sandman', cover song, and two 'Kill 'Em All' songs, the second one being obligatory 'Seek and Destroy'.\n\nI mean, at this point Metallica released 2 official albums which have this setlist structure, and countless of bootlegs from other shows. How hard it was to do some fucking changes? It wasn't until 2014/2015 when they're finally shaken the formula up, but seeing almost exact same-y setlist for 3rd time, with few song appearing on the THIRD RELEASE IN A ROW, makes me absolutely LIVID, to put it mildly. Like, why should I buy this release over, let's say, 'Orgullo, Pasion y Gloria' or 'Francais Pour Une Nuit'? Because without it, I'm only losing Big Four's joined performance of 'Am I Evil' (and aside from Lombardo, Slayer didn't even bother to show up, so fuck'em) and other three concerts, but aside from Megadeth, I wouldn't cry over losing them. And right now, I'm kind sick to death of hearing 'Blackened' or 'Cyanide', and don't even get me started on fucking 'One'. Why not give 'My Apocalypse' or 'The Shortest Straw' some exposure? Yeah, I know they're on 'Quebec Magnetic'. But before 2012, QM was nowhere near close release, so again, what does Metallica fan gains by buying this release?\n\nProblem two, perfomances. I know it's cheap to make fun of Lars' poor drumming skills and Kirk's excessive attachment to wah pedal, but it's just too easy. Apparently, they did improve in the last few years on 'Hardwired' tours, but it's all too little, too late. And Kirk is still unable to play one solo without his livesafer. Something that was charming in the 80s, is now pathetic. Thankfully, Rob and James are league above the other half of the Metallica. I mean, Rob comes from Infectious Groove, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Label Society and played for Ozzy fucking Osbourne, so what else is there to say? Metallica always had a nose for great bassists, and Rob is no different (even if Burton's creative inputs and Newsted devilish backing vocals will always be missed). James was always a tight rhythm guitarist, sometimes even providing some great solos ('Master of Puppets' and 'Nothing Else Matters' being most prominent examples) and while his voice is rather a huge downgrade from 80s, he's nowhere near as bad as Araya or Belladonna. And he's without a doubt a great frontman, encouraging audience to sing with him, giving some peptalks and stuff.\n\nProblem three, sound. While I can compliment 'Orgullo, Pasion y Gloria' and 'Francais Pour Une Nuit' for their clean and sleak sound, this one however starts to show some cracks. The drums feel like they're trying to remind the 'And Justice for All' era, to which I say: \"STOP!\", while the bass seem to trying to find its place in the mix. That might be only complaints about the sound, cause guitars and vocals are good enough. And of course, the 'Am I Evil' with other bands is a highlight for a lot of people, but my would rather be 'All Nightmare Long' - hearing this song live every time feels great, and even with those performers this song's atmosphere is more than enough to make it worth a listen. My rating for this show is somewhere around 65%, 70% at most. I'm getting sick of hearing 'Blackened', 'One' and 'Cyanide' on each of the DVD they've released. And Lars and Kirk should really start to suck it up and practicing a lot, because if it wasn't for James and Rob, they would probably be thrown out of the band long time ago.\n\nI decided to save the best for the last, i.e. Megadeth. Hell yes, that's one show that I can't complain about much. Or rather, I'd need to resort to nitpicking to actually find flaws. Setlist is great for a show that lasts only 1 hour (although 'Holy Wars' being played twice is questionable for me), the musicianship is top notch, and the sound is great. Well, okay, now for complaints, number 1, lack of Dave's interaction with crowd. I know he's not as great of a vocalist, but as a charismatic persona, he should interact with audience more. Here he only says couple of words before 'Head Crusher' and that's it. Live performances have this advantage of interacting with the crowd, yet Mustaine didn't decided to use that. Shame, cause this show, while being fantastic, definitely needs to catch a breath. Number 2, while drums and bass sound fucking perfect ('Hook in a Mouth' opening proves that), the guitars feel muddled, and sound like they've caught a stage fright...? Although it's probably due to rain during the perfomance, and some nasty weather is not enough to spook out Megadeth, so I can forgive that. Aside from that, though, I have no complaints. 90% from me. Funnily enough, I considered the show to be the weakest out of entire 4 back in the day I bought this DVD. How the turns have tabled indeed...\n\nHonestly, 'The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria' is rather a disappointing release. 1 show is a complete disaster, other two are hampered by certain musicians, and only one actually delievers on what fans want. This is really far from what, in comparison, Testament or Motorhead can offer in terms of live perfomance, and it's definitely inferior to all of those bands' previous live recordings, 'Decade of Aggresion' and 'Live Shit' especially. I would just recommend to check out those bands' other DVDs, because it's really not worth it just for the sake of Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Dave Lombardo performing 'Am I Evil'. Well, that, and the fact that these bands aren't really the 'Big Four of Thrash'.\n",
        "\nOh boy, OH BOY, if it isn't a big one...\n\n'St. Anger' is often being regarded as the one of the worst metal acts ever put to date, alongside other infamous releases like 'Illud Divinum Insanus' by Morbid Angel, 'Turbo' by Judas Priest, 'Risk' by Megadeth, any part of 'Graveyard Classics' by Six Feet Under or even 'Lulu', which Metallica made in collaboration with long-gone Lou Reed. And for a good reason, even though since 2003, this album somehow gained a cult following.\n\nFans makes statements such as \"It's an misunderstood masterpiece\", \"They create what they want, they don't have to appeal to everyone\", or even asking to watch some on-the-nose documentary to understood the band's situation. No, nothing can excuse a band for not only making such a shallow and empty record, but also CHARGING OVER 15$ for this piece of garbage. 15$, which I could spend on whatever other album I could think of. Heck, even if it was given to fans for free I would felt robbed of time I wasted on this record.\n\nLike, where do I even start? The production, everyone knows how this \"album\" sounds like. The guitars felt more like a background rather than forefront, they also sound pretty muddy. Joking about drum sound is pretty stale at this point, but even then I can't survive 2 songs without receiving a migrane. It's like listening to Tara Strong's take on Harley Quinn, since they both JUST. WON'T. STOP. Band like Metallica should really have someone who could step up and say \"No guys, this sucks, let's do it the other way\". Since apparently Lars was the one who wanted this specific snare sound, he should've been talked down by manager/any other guy with big position in a band, instead of letting him have a free-for-all. Bob Rock is simply not a metal producer.\n\nAlso, bass is almost non-existant. And it's not because Jason Newsted is gone, so no one was there to record bass guitar - after all, Bob decided to record bass lines. Also, the guy who was responsible for mastering this record should been fired the first chance they get, as 'St. Anger' was brick-walled like hell. I know it's a thing since 90s, but I don't care. Loudness War shouldn't exist, but still some producers think cranking up albums volume up to 11 is a good thing. Just... Jesus Christ.\n\nBut oh, that's the point, right, dear fanboys? \"It was meant to be a raw, muddy sound!\". 'The New Order' by Testament has a great, raw sound, 'Vile' by Cannibal Corpse sounds muddy, which fit the album's mood. Even Embers of Euphoria's self-tilted debut is far from a perfectly clean sound, but it's leagues above this shit.\n\nBut, but, that's not the worst thing. Even with 2015's fan re-recording this album is horrible. The songwriting is absolutely abysmal for over 80% of the records' runtime. Well, maybe there is a one or two songs that stand above being boring. 'Dirty Window' is one of them, and with no remorse I can say, it's the only one I enjoy with no major flaws. Title track could also be good, if it wasn't for few gripes: one, the afwul Linkin Park-esque verses, which really kills the mood and two, those goddamn repeats. I swear, this song takes over 7 minutes, which could have been easily shortened to 5. Nothing gives the song any good reason to overstay its welcome (since Hammett's solos are not featured here), so it's just keep repeating sections we've heard already... Kinda like majority of modern Iron Maiden's discography.\n\nThe rest of the songs however, I wouldn't even listened to them at a gunpoint. All of them are convoluted mess. One of the finest example of this is 'Frantic', which at the end all of a sudden pulls off completely out of place riff that has no build-up. No one, even drunk or a person who never heard anything metal, would say that this last riff was made with 'Frantic' in mind. Even without it, 'Frantic' changes the mood way too often to stay consistent, so that last riff is basically just a nail in the coffiin. 'Some Kind of Monster' doesn't even wait until the end, its very first minute contain many riffs that just don't fit each other, and the rest of the album just keeps dragging, and dragging, and I just can't. Fucking. Stand it. Listening to those abominations makes me want to turn on any DragonForce album since 'The Power Within', because even those albums, that can't find their indentity, are less annoying than this dumpster fire.\n\nAlso, the state of Metallica at that point was absolutely dismal. Kirk doesn't contribute any solos on this album, although given the fact that he hasn't played any solo without wah pedal for last few decades, that might be a good thing. Or maybe not, since the band couldn't came up with anything else that would make the songs interesting. Lars, well, let's just forget it, as at this point I have no idea for any joke about his weak drumming that hasn't been told already. James is a compeletely different thing, since he used to be a fairly okay vocalist and quite tight rhythm guitarist, even providing some genuinely great solos, like on 'Master of Puppets'. But whatever the state he was in, the vocals are one of the worst I've heard. Even Robb Flynn or Toxic Avenger's vocalists are nothing compare to what James is doing on here. A lot of the vocals here are straight up annoying, and sometimes even incomprehensible, like the line in 'Dirty Window' being \"and now I slam my gavel down\", although it sounds more like \"I slain my devil down\", which made it even dumber at first. Both vocally and lyrically, Hetfield is stepping down his game here.\n\nBut EVEN THAT isn't the worst thing. A lot of people want to claim this is \"100% authentic\" album, that every thing that sucks on this album, sucks for a reason, it's about \"emotions\" the band was going through. If all of this was really sincere, then why do they charge OVER 15$ for this, on par with every other record available? I'll tell you why. Because it's not \"100% authentic\". This album is just a demo that should never see the light of day. But it did, because they wouldn't let go of all the sweet money they could get from releasing this album, and there always will be people who will defend it, no matter what.\n\n\"It's a good stress relief\", you say? Just turn on anything Vader has in its catalogue, or any Death Angel album that isn't called 'Act III', you're gonna have a much better time. Or play DOOM. And no, just because Metallica recorded it, it doesn't mean it wouldn't be so \"hated\". A lot people wouldn't just bat an eye on this.\n",
        "\nMetallica has gotten a lot of beating from metal fans ever since 'Black Album' came out, and still does. I have to admit, I'm a bit guilty of it myself. They're just such an easy target nowadays that we keep forgetting how much of an cultural and influential phenomenon they were back in the glory days. When 'Kill 'Em All' first came out, no one knew what even was this thing. But it was clear to everyone this is where metal should go next - aggressive, wild and relentless whiplash. Their next big release, 'Ride the Lightning', display a lot of maturity the band have gained, and in just a matter of year.\n\nHowever, unlike any other RTL review out there, I'm not gonna elaborate on tight musician relationship, brilliant songwriting, or lyrical themes. You know it, I know it, everyone and their mom know it. Here I'll focus on a very overlooked aspect of 'Ride The Lightning' that makes this album truly stand out from the rest of the genre - its structure. What do I mean by that? It'll be perfectly clear once I explain this.\n\nSo we start out 'Ride The Lightning' with a classic thrasher called 'Fight Fire With Fire'. 40 seconds of acoustic guitar is then interrupted by a massive explosion in the form of straightforward main riff. The song itself keeps the pace fast through entire song, which really gives it this \"take-no-prisoners\" vibe to it. The next song is the title track, and it's far more different than what Metallica had done back then - it starts off much slower, builds the momentum until the pace picks up after second chorus, and then it slows down for first lead, it speeds up for the rest of solo, but before final verse it comes back to it's beginning tempo. All the changes in tempo are very welcome, even 'No Remorse' felt rather standard in that regard.\n\nThen we receive a much slower and even dramatic 'For Whom The Bell Tolls', with another iconic input from Burton's bass guitar. 'Fade To Black' was a novelty even for Metallica back in 84', due to it being a straight-up ballad. Soft verse-heavy chorus structure became kind of this band's ballads standard, broke in the middle by very much 'A National Acrobat' type of riff, staying attached to the song to its very end.\n\nWe break the mood from overly dramatic atmosphere this album builded so far with another straightforward classic, 'Trapped Under Ice'. Unto the next, we have a rather typical heavy metal song called 'Escape', which seems to be the weakest link of this record. Aaaaaand... I am not disproving that saying the song is an misunderstood masterpiece, but it's not out of place either.\n\nAfter that one, the album's thrash vibe goes back with 'Creeping Death', as well as dramatic atmosphere we broke from two song ago. 'Ride The Lightning' closes on the same big note as it started, with massive instrumental 'The Call of Cthulhu', referencing a classic H.P. Lovecraft novel. It's one of two RTL's songs (including title track) which still has Dave Mustaine's song-writing influence. Not that it's really important, just a little fun fact.\n\nSo what all this means in the end? I'll ask in a different way. Would you love 'Ride The Lightning' as the same if it started with 'Escape', if the title track was closing this album, or if 'Fight Fire With Fire' was put somewhere in the middle? Well, I'll leave the answers up to you. But for me, 'Ride The Lightning' stands among the best thrash metal releases, along side Metallica's next album, 'Coma of Souls', 'The Ultra-Violence', 'The New Order', 'Eternal Nightmare' etc. because the album structure is as well-thoughtout as it is. It may be due to time limit constraints of vinyls etc., but I like to think it was a creative decision. The way the songs are put along each other keeps the momentum going, and complements them in a way that every song feel like their at the right place, even if not every one of them is straight-up awesome or brilliant.\n\nI think people don't notice how much of an impact a tracklist of a metal album can have on listeners. When done right, like here or 'The Number of the Beast' (original release, not any other that insist on putting 'Total Eclipse' to the main CD), it creates a truly incredible experience and it's a damn good reason why many people are calling them \"the best metal albums of all time\". Or it can trick you into believing that a not-so-stellar album is much better than it seems. Case in point - 'Heroes of Origin' by Hatriot. Most of its content is either decent or even good, but 'Heroes (...)' structure at first did made me think this album is pure awesomeness. Not that it's wrong or anything, I still like Hatriot a lot.\n\nWhen done poorly, like basically everything nowadays, it still has the potential for great albums, but it shows also bands' laziness in that regard, that they didn't bother structing the album properly, so the songs would complement each other. This thing separates the true masterpieces from good but flawed albums. And it's a shame, because no one even realized how powerful of a tool album's tracklist can be. Go listen to 'Ride the Lightning' people. And take notes on how to make truly awesome metal albums.\n",
        "\nI've been a huge fan of Metallica for a long time now, while they're not the band to have gotten me into the genre, they without a doubt have contributed to my appreciation of metal and have helped evolve my taste from the simple but solid sounds of Black Sabbath and Judas Priest to the aggressive and heart pumping anthems of Slipknot and Megadeth. However, for the longest time one particular release had eluded me. No, it wasn't St. Anger, it was actually S&M. Why did it take me so long to get around to this? I'm not sure, since symphonic metal is one of my favourite sub-genres. I had previously listened to S&M2 around the time of its release and I enjoyed it, a solid live performance, but I had no idea what it could have been. Tracks that I had simply enjoyed were taken to a whole new level.\n\nUpon first listening to this album I was disappointed at the amount of Black Album and Load/Reload era tracks on there, but after listening to it more I've grown to appreciate that decision, because not only does it make those more complex tracks carry much more weight, but it adds so much to what were otherwise very simplistic songs. Bleeding me and Of Wolf And Man in particular turn from what were decent songs on their respective albums, to these incredible, larger than life songs. I absolutely love the classic horror movie vibes I get from the orchestral arrangements in Of Wolf And Man, much like the original song, it feels like it shouldn't work, but somehow it does, and I think that's a great summary of the album as a whole.\n\nThe concept of taking songs from Metallica's discography and putting a symphony in the back sounds odd, but considering the late bassist Cliff Burton's love for classical music and Michael Kamen's musical genius and the relative flexibility of Metallica at the time, on top of their current experimental phase coming right off of Load/Reload, comes together to create something that should not be. Adding onto my previous point about the track list, it's only appropriate for them to cover so many of the newer songs (besides marketability) as if they're saying to Burton, \"we know you would've loved this, so it's all for you\".\n\nHighlights from this album aside from the previously mentioned include Call of Ktulu and Master of Puppets, and as a starter they blew it out of the water. The original Call of Ktulu track was actually my first ever Metallica song, but the problem is that it wasn't a good introduction for someone who was still getting into metal, what with the length, the repetition and the fact that there were no vocals. However, what made me change my mind about this song was this rendition, the orchestra adds so much to this song its unbelievable. It's a pity that Jason Newsted couldn't play those awesome bass riffs that were in the original but the orchestra makes up for that, as well as the overall improved production from Ride The Lightning. Going from this incredible journey of a song, with the symphony swelling, to then transition into the crescendo of the iconic beginning riff of Master of Puppets is a feeling like no other. Words cannot describe the pure 17 minutes of badassery that this combination makes and in my opinion makes this album worth it, and we're only at track 3!\n\nOther highlights include For Whom The Bell Tolls, One, Battery and the two original tracks on the record, -Human and No Leaf Clover. The former 3 are basically more of the same from what I've already explained, the production and symphony add to the tracks and does them justice, but No Leaf Clover in particular is a standout on this album. Not only is it just a great song from the get-go but it also is possible the strongest example of what makes Metallica as a band so great. You start off with the grandiose piece from the orchestra, then juxtaposed by the beautiful strings along with the undistorted guitars shows Metallica's softer side from their iconic ballads, Fade to Black, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), then interrupted by the heavy, anthemic drop showing what made Metallica so memorable in the metal scene - the hooks and the riffs. This constant battle between the two sides, culminating with them coming together for one of the best climaxes in their history is simply brilliant.\n\nHowever, this album isn't without its faults. For one, the autotune. I'll be blunt - I hate it. James had something real good going for him on Load, while it was a change it still gave them an identity, not to mention 1999 is considered by many to be James' peak in vocal performances, so having the autotune make him sound so fake irritates me a lot. That on top of that, I don't like a few of the renditions from this album. The autotune really ruins the beauty of Nothing Else Matters for me, and the orchestra in the beginning portion of The Outlaw Torn felt very unnecessary and jarring, going from the slow and patient original to this very conflicted cover, bothers me a lot since that was one of my favourite songs from Load/Reload. Hero of the day also sticks out to me as we already have the calm interlude of Nothing Else Matters on the album, and overall just felt like they were trying to market Load/Reload rather than make a solid track.\n\nIn conclusion; S&M is one of Metallica's best, even if many people do hate it and has a few flaws. What the orchestral performance brings to the songs is an overall net positive and even makes me like songs I wasn't too keen on beforehand, whilst also elevating songs I had already liked to a new level. It was a treat to listen to this album, and I'm so sad it's taken this long to get to for me. It really was a freight train coming from the soothing light at the end of a tunnel.\n",
        "\nMetallica is one of those bands that comes around in their early years, makes some killer music, and then as the years pass by the band gets older and older and loses their sense of touch. Since the mid-1990s the band has steadily declined, first abandoning their roots in Load, ReLoad, and St. Anger, then having an \u201cOh Shit\u201d moment in the early 2000s, and now they\u2019re a dad band. Despite all this, the early classics, the \u201coriginal trilogy\u201d of Metallica albums holds up better than ever even in the modern sense. \n\nThus bringing us to Ride the Lightning, the sophomore effort of the titan of heavy metal. Stylistically as one might expect, there\u2019s still quite a sizable influence from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, albeit its a lot less present than on Kill \u2018Em All. Every once in a while it will hit you in the face (and, usually, kick your ass while doing it) such as in the famous \u201cDIE!\u201d section of Creeping Death, Metallica striking the perfect balance between their roots and inspirations, as well as making great strides in the genre. \n\nThe overall sound of the album certainly has that older feel to it, though I can\u2019t understand the choice of so much reverb. On everything. While that might seem like a con, it has its ups and downs. It does absolutely help on some songs like For Whom the Bell Tolls, Creeping Death and Ride the Lightning, while dragging parts of others down, like the acoustic section of Fade to Black and Fight Fire with Fire. Hetfield\u2019s vocals feel bigger, but Kirk Hammett\u2019s solo chops are almost drowned out at times, which drains from the performance. When you look at other albums to come out around the same time, such as Helloween\u2019s Keeper of the Seven Keys, you know it\u2019s not impossible to have a lot going on and still keep the integrity of a good solo present in the sound. \n\nAnother gripe I would have with the album is that Fade to Black, while an emotionally impactful song and definitely good, just drags on and on and on. It\u2019s very tempting to reach for that skip button after about the first half, and sadly, Metallica seemed to have not learned from this later in their career. \n\nEven with these detractions, this is still a fantastic work of musicianship. Fight Fire with Fire is definitely the most NWOBHM inspired song, would\u2019ve fit in perfectly on the first album. The title track is an absolutely blazing storm of heavy metal, hitting you right in the face for its entirety. And then we come to For Whom the Bell Tolls, a song that highlights just how much Bassist Cliff Burton truly brought to the table. In times when a Bass Solo would\u2019ve been considered blasphemy, Cliff takes the *lead*, and does it pretty damn well. Then of course the iconic outro, which bells ominously ringing in the background. \n\nSongs like Escape and Creeping Death bring true speed to the table, enough to give even the most seasoned headbangers a cramp in their neck. On the latter track in particular, despite the aforementioned fighting he has to do in the mix, Kirk Hammett plays an amazing solo, probably one of Metallica\u2019s best if I\u2019m being quite honest. \n\nCall of Ktulu brings things home as a closer, showing Metallica can write damn good instrumentals. The ominous melodies conjuring images of horrors unimaginable perfectly captures HP Lovecraft\u2019s demented mind, and the song is worth multiple listens over in any occasion. \n\nOverall, despite its flaws, Ride the Lightning is a true classic of Heavy Metal, perfectly capturing the sheer power of the genre while also simultaneously pioneering thrash, building upon the foundation of Kill \u2018Em All and essentially throwing the cards on the table for Master of Puppets.\n",
        "\nSt. Anger has been out for almost 18 years, and people are still confused by it to this day. But before the album was released, Metallica was killing it in the 90s. Their eponymous album in 1991 officially brought them into the mainstream, and while \"Load\", \"Reload\", and \"Garage Inc.\" were met with mixed reception from fans, those albums still sold well. However, things took a turn for the worst for the band at the start of the new millennium when the band, and especially Lars, sued Napster for alleged copyright infringement and made them not only remove their songs, but also banned 300,000 users from their site. But that controversy was just the tip of the iceberg. Their bassist, Jason Newsted, also left the band, accusing them of mistreating him. But the most damaging one was with James Hetfield. After returning from rehab, Hetfield acted like the more wise one in the band and got more personal, leading to several problems during the album's recording.\n\nIn fact, when you factor in the controversies with Napster, Jason Newsted, and James Hetfield's degrading personality, it's kinda amazing to see \"St. Anger\" not come out as a jumbled mess, but rather a fascinating mess. Not only did the band experimented in an alternative and even nu metal sound, but the way the album was composed overall felt more like it came from an amateur teen band that was just getting started rather than from mainstream professionals. But while some consider it a \"so bad it's good\" album, I personally find \"St. Anger\" as a \"so bad it's bad\" album. It has its moments, but for the most part, it sucks.\n\nOne notable thing about the album is the instrumentals. Now I'm pretty sure everyone is aware of the poor sound of the snare drums, and that I'm not the first person in the world to joke about how Lars was on a tight budget during recording, so he had to use garbage cans for the drums. But while the snares sound awful and feel out of place with the rest of the instruments, in retrospect, it's actually not the worst part about the instruments. That will have to go to the guitar riffs. An example of this would be in the first track \"Frantic\". The guitars play some nu metal-like riffs, but they sound very dull and tiresome. In fact, most tracks have the guitars play terrible riffs that felt like they were poorly stolen from other alternative/nu metal riffs at the time. What makes this even worse is that the poor riffs end up hurting the other instruments in the long run. The drums are having to beat in incoherent patterns and, of course, they sound even worse with the snares. There isn't even a bass guitar to establish a foundation, so the songs feel like they're disorganized. And don't even get me started on the composition and structure of the songs, where these poor instrumentals are dragged on for an unnecessary amount of time. This makes this one hour album feel like two hours instead. The instrumentals on this album are terrible, and this album still has one of the worst instrumentals in Metallica's discography.\n\nJames Hetfield's vocals are also affected. Now this isn't to say that the vocals are terrible. As a matter of fact, his vocals have plenty of good moments. In the track \"St. Anger\", Hetfield starts off with some melodic singing that sounds good and flows with the slow instrumentals well. As the track progresses, his voice gets more aggressive and the tone of the instruments reflect on his voice well. This good contrast between the vocals and instruments make \"St. Anger\" one of the only good songs off the album. However, even his vocals can have some poor moments. In tracks like \"Some Kind of Monster\", the production is poor to a point where it makes Hetfield's vocals sound quiet. These quiet vocals are very unfitting to the mad atmosphere of the instruments. And in the track \"Invisible Kid\", Hetfield's singing actually sounds awful, as his voice feels forced and unemotional, making the lyrics about letting go of fear feel unconvincing. The vocals on this album may be one of the better parts of the album, but it still has plenty of off-putting moments that end up hurting the tracks more than improve them.\n\nAnd then there's the lyrics. Now Metallica may not be the most lyrical band, but the simple lyrics in most of their songs do offer enough detail to set the tone for the tracks. \"St. Anger\", however, does not do that. In fact, the lyrics are too simplified to impact the track. For example, in the song \"Purify\", this verse quotes:\n\nTear it down, strip the layers off, my turpentine\nOld paint, old looks, cover up the past\nWhite heat, white light, super white bones, bones of you and I\n\nThe first two lines on that verse are supposedly a metaphor of letting go of the past. However, the third line about bones end up ruining the metaphor. In fact, the main theme in \"Purify\" is inconsistent, and it makes the lyrics feel random, which won't be a bad thing if it wasn't executed terribly. The song goes for a more abrasive tone, and it makes the lyrics feel unwelcomed in the chaotic atmosphere. But \"All Within My Hands\" is easily the worst track in the lyrical department. Take a look at this verse, which quotes:\n\nAll within my hands\nSqueeze it in, crush it down\nAll within my hands\nHold it dear, hold it suffocate\n\nThis verse is about Hetfield crushing the things he hates. The lyrics seem brutal, but Hetfield sings the verse, which makes it seem like he is crushing them very softly. The constant switching of the tone in the instruments and vocals make the lyrics feel worthless, since the listener doesn't know what Hetfield really means about crushing things with his hands. And that's not even mentioning the \"Kill!\" part near the end. Hetfield's annoying screaming makes these repetitive lyrics sound abysmal and unbearable. The lyrics are terribly written, and the changing atmosphere of the tracks make their execution sound atrocious.\n\nBut before I conclude my review, I gotta address those who defend this album. \"St. Anger\" has gained a cult following in recent years, and its fans are willing to defend it. The main defense I see for St. Anger is that the album's raw and inconsistent sound is a reflection of the band's ongoing drama at the time, making the album feel \"authentic\". While I can kinda see what they're talking about, at the same time, I don't agree with it. Take Mayhem's \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\" for example. The band went through more severe controversy that would've made Metallica's controversy look like child's play. However, the cold and dark atmosphere of the album reflects their problems well, and even without the drama, the songs have some memorable riffs and poetic lyrics that make DMDS worthy of listening. However, as I've stated earlier, the songs aren't that good by themselves, and all that rawness and aggression feels like an exaggeration of what really happened. Now I'm not saying the band members needed to kill each other, but a bassist quitting and James Hetfield acting like a smartass does not equal the album having these feelings anxiety and fear. Therefore, the chaotic atmosphere ends up making the album feel like an exaggeration instead.\n\nSo overall, \"St. Anger\" is a horrible album. The instrumentation is very generic and poor, and the lyrics were better off not being written at all. The only good thing that came from this album is the track \"St. Anger\", plenty of good vocal moments, and \"Death Magnetic\" being a massive improvement. But is that to say that St. Anger is the worst album ever? No. Unlike stuff like \"Turbo\", which makes my blood boil at the thought of a band intentionally changing their sound, I just can't blame the band for creating this. They were clearly going through a lot of crap behind the scenes, and the recording sessions of this album felt more like them letting out their stress and coping through one of the roughest times in their career since Cliff Burton's death. However, it probably would've been better if they had scrapped this album altogether, since all that did was further taint their image. Besides the second track, \"St. Anger\" is an album that you should avoid.\n",
        "\nEvolution is a beautiful thing. Metallica is a band that has always evolved and stayed in tune with times, that's part of what made them maybe the most successful metal band of all times.\n\nSt.Anger is nothing less than a miracle. Metallica was a broken band and could easily break up prior to this album for various reasons: the Napster lawsuit, Hetfield battling with alcoholism, a natural burnout of being with the same people 24/7 for decades, the departure of Newsted, etc.\n\nHowever, none of that could subjugate the band, and six years after their last album with original material, St.Anger was born. And thank god it did.\n\nFirst of all, forget about everything Metallica has made before 2003. St.Anger is a complete reinvention of the band. The goal with this album was to deliberately create a raw, unpolished sound, which is 180 degrees the opposite from the refined production of their 90's albums. Instead of sounding like a million dollar hard rock band making the best sounding album possible, they opted to create a garage band vibe that just play live together and let the aggression come out. There are almost no overdubs on the vocals, the snare drum sounds like a trash can on purpose and there's an overall muddy quality to the final mix of the album which make it sounds more like a demo than an official studio album, which is exactly what the band wanted to achieve.\n\nThe musical direction reflects quite accurately the early 00's metal sound: more emphasis on rhythmic down tuned guitars, and less solos and melodic riffs. Forget about the 80's trash metal sound or the 90's hard rock, St.Anger came out in a new decade and as I mentioned earlier, the band always knew how to stay relevant with what's happening in the world.\n\nMost of the lyrics are quite simple and straightforward. There's a lot of aggression and despair in the songs, which reflects the hard times the band dealt with quite authentically. There are no hidden messages or double meanings, not much depth as well, just pure aggression and raw energies that fits the crushing riffs superbly.\n\nEven though that most of the songs feel quite simple and short, the average length of each track is almost 7 minutes, which is quite amazing. The title track is without a doubt one of the highlights of this album, and one of the most authentic songs the band has ever made. I can connect more with a person exposing his inner world and thoughts in the most direct and straightforward form possible, than someone who hides between clever metaphors and reveals nothing personal. The opening riff is very simple and to the point and is repeated several times with alternating drum patterns. The verse has a mellower vibe with clean guitars, and the pre-chorus and chorus are aggressive and catchy enough to bring this song to a truly great level. \n\n'Some Kind Monster' is another great track. There are tons of catchy and rhythmic riffs, and even occasional semi melodic lead guitar in the intro which enhances even further the opening riff. The vocal delivery is very rhythmic and is quite close to rap in the verses, and goes back to more hard rock vibe in the chorus. I won't lie, having some flashy guitar solos of Kirk Hammet could only improve the song, but even in its rough form the song works very well.\n\nI can understand why a lot pf people despise this album, it's not \"pure metal\" and sounds very different than the prior albums of the band. I simply don't care, I just enjoy this album very much. If 'St.Anger' was the debut album of a new band in 2003, I have no doubt this album could have gone to sell even more than the 5 million copies it did and it would probably wouldn't receive the hatred it did in some circles.\n\nWhat made me like this album so much, is that it's just 100% authentic. I believe every word Hetfield sing, I feel the sincerity and raw emotions of this album in every riff and drum hit and it's just feel like the purest, most realistic representation of Metallica in 2003. Sure it's not as epic or sophisticated as their 80's albums, not as polished as the black album, and less varied than 'Load '+'Reload'. But it's different, and in a good way.\n\n'St.Anger' is a courageous, unapologetic and deliberately rough album, created by authentic people for authentic people. Listen to this album with an open mind and you'll discover one of the realest albums ever made with tons of catchy riffs and overwhelming energies.\n",
        "\nThere were times when Metallica was one of the greatest metal acts in american music history - back in the 80s. Despite what some elitist morons tries to say about that Metallica (probably because it wasn't just mindless whiplash like Slayer), they were kings of their time. Very few could match the precision, sound recognition and genius these guys had in their prime - maybe Testament, Exodus, Death Angel and Vio-lence. And Megadeth, of course! But their last truly great effort - 'Master of Puppets' - came out in 1986, and it's been... 35 years since then. It's almost unbelievable, this album is 12 years older than me.\n\nBut now, we have 2021, and a lot have changed since then - including Metallica itself. Whatever was I thinking about them since being introduced to metal music, it's now mostly gone. Well, let's be real here, Metallica seems to have no desire to make new music. Just look at all the other stuff they've been doing before 'Hardwired (...)' came out - suit endorsement, box office failure known as 'Metallica: Through The Never', hanging out with... Lady Gaga. Of all other celebs they could think of... Therefore, it's no suprise to me that 'Hardwired... To Self-Destruct' is a colossal failure at song-writing department, production value and even band relationship.\n\nThe kind of title track starts out the album on fairly decent note - it's fast and straightforward, and wastes no time for any pointless slowdown, although it's cringeworthy lines in chorus are only slightly above usual tough guy attitude Robb Flynn loves to display on his shitshow called 'Machine Head'. Surely, I could have think of better ways to kickstart an Metallica album on a high note, but it always could have been worse... Right? 'Atlas Rise' is a much better song overall, even if it's slowing down to mid-paced tempo, mostly thanks to the Iron Maiden-like harmonies, which makes the song stand out above the rest. 'Moth Into Flame', with a better solo and more tighter instrumental performance, could have easily stand among other classic songs of their discography. Something similar could have been said about 'Spit Out The Bone', only this one drags a bit near the end and pointlessly slows down before the second lead. Also, the bonus tracks contain re-recorded version of 'Lords of Summer' which have been cut in some areas to make a tighter heavy/thrash metal song overall. Why isn't this a part of main album?\n\nAnd that would sum up the good stuff about 'Hardwired (...)'. 4 (5, including 'Lords') decent/good songs is not really much, when there's still 8 to go through. And I really have no idea what was Metallica thinking while writing them. 'Halo on Fire' definitely doesn't hold a candle to similar sounding 'Halo of Flies' by Alice Cooper. 'Confused' starts out on the 'Am I Evil' beginning note by Diamond Head, but then it just goes in a route that has nothing to do with this motive, so why even make this reference at all? 'Dream No More' is just like that 'Sad But True 2: Electric Boogaloo' meme, but I have yet to witness a situation when a band making direct reference to their older song doesn't end up as a parody. 'Here Comes Revenge', 'Now That We're Dead', 'Am I Savage' and 'ManUNKind' are fairly forgettable pieces of music that no one will remember two days after hearing them and probably wouldn't feel any different if they were never recorded. The last one also has probably the dumbest idea for a music video, where a wannabe black metal band plays this pop-rock thing. I mean... Why? Like, why even do this 'trve kvlt' imagery for a song that has barely anything to do with metal at all? Lich King in their famous diss track towards black metal manage to parody that genre back in 2008, and that's a band that probably didn't even had 1000 people at their live shows. Could Metallica not be bothered with at least make a black-metal style intro song for a video and have the rest of the song play as it does? Or, you know, make a different video? I'm just left here thinking \"Why?\".\n\nBut trust me, that thing is mostly just mind-boggling. 'The Murder One' however, it's a complete different barrel of crap. In the theory, it's a tribute for Lemmy Kilmister from Mot\u00f6rhead. The problem is, if you know Mot\u00f6rhead and the type of music they play, and you had no idea 'The Murder One\" was meant to be a tribute, you could never tell. This sound like it crawled its way out of 'Load'/'Reload', with obvious references to legend of british rock'n'roll in lyrics. It may appear to be a Mot\u00f6rhead tribute, but it sure as hell doesn't feel like one. James, you know what Lemmy would love to hear as a tribute? A relentless, dirty and loaded with energy 'Overkill'/'Civil War' type of song, something that without any doubt had very fucking big influence on early Metallica. Right now, I only imagine Lemmy laughing his ass off from wherever he is now, knowing what his most influential disciples are doing to honor him. Look, you wanna hear a proper Mot\u00f6rhead tribute - Saxon and 'They Played Rock And Roll' from 'Thunderbolt' got you covered.\n\nAnd you know what's the funniest thing about this whole thing is? Sodom on their deluxe edition of 'In War And Pieces' back in 2010 had a song called also 'Murder One'. And it sound just like Lemmy himself would have wrote that! And it didn't need those \"on-the-nose\" references of Lemmy's band to feel like a tribute to Tom Angelripper's biggest idol. Go figure who cares more about their idols. Heck, Death Angel made 'I Came For Blood' on 'Humanicide' and this is just a straight-up Mot\u00f6rhead from 'Overnight Sensation'/'Snake Bite Love' era. And again, no obvious references to 'Born to lose, live to win' clich\u00e9.\n\nAll this perfectly shows that Metallica has no idea what made them great in the first place. With its overly clean and empty production and half of the band barely able to keep up with the other half, 'Hardwired (...)' is just a waste of everyone's time. Who was this released for? Classic heavy metal fans will find it bloated, and probably get bored after its first half. Fans of progressive metal would consider this version of Metallica a bunch of talentless idiots who have no idea what 'progressive' means. Thrash metal fans probably just downloaded 'Hardwired', 'Moth into Flame', 'Spit out the Bone' and maybe 'Atlas Rise!' and haven't bothered with the rest. Only people who will be content with this disaster are fanboys, as they will consume everything the band throws at them.\n\nIt's a shame we reach a moment like this, because seriously, making fun of Metallica gives me no pleasure. They don't have as much of elitists in their fanbse believing that they're the only thrash band that matters, like Slayer, its members aren't as oblivious and lacking self-awareness like Robb Flynn does, and I still believe that them being at the top of the music world in 80s was no accident or \"right place, right time\" situation. If that was the case, why are 'Ride the Lighting' and 'Master of Puppets' are still regarded as one of the greatest albums among the other thrash metal acts?\n\nAnd it's not like I just hate Metallica or consider everything post-Master trash. Despite being incoherent and overbloated mess, I still like a lot of what both 'Loads' have to offer, and 'Death Magnetic', if you manage to get your hands on any type of remaster or declipped version and do little cuts to songs here and there, is a decent record with some great bangers. The problem is, Metallica seriously needs to get a grip, think what they want to be and just keep going in this direction. Even though it would only solve about half of their modern era problem, it would be a step-up from whatever we got here. Because on 'Hardwired (...)' Metallica is trying to be everything they have been so far, and the effects are lamentable.\n",
        "\n...James Hetfield shouts halfway into \"Brandenburg Gate.\" Interesting song title. He's accompanied by some good heavy metal riffs he's playing, an old man that broke into the studio, and two stupid talentless hacks that call themselves \"musicians\" playing along with him. Oh, almost forgot, the old man was kind enough to bring his guitar to jam with this cool little new heavy metal band. I think they'll be successful one day, their riffs show promise!\n\nI think the old man is talking about some of his past friends. I don't know who Boris Karloff and Kinski are. Apparently, he was in some small little band called \"The Velvet Underground\" forty years prior. His talking sure reminds me of the lyrics he wrote for that band decades ago. Wait, I think it's actually poetry! I can only wonder what incredible poetic lines like \"I would cut my legs and tits off\" or \"To be dry and spermless like a girl\" are supposed to symbolise, albeit I can say they sound very funny when this old man is just rambling about that when Metallica is rehearsing in the studio. The two really do create a comedic effect together!\n\nSo strums his trusty acoustic guitar, the old man. He probably played it when these youngsters were just little kiddies in elementary school, and it shows! They can't keep up with his amazingly complex polyrhythms that change every bar. His singing is also similarly complicated and technically of a very high level. He's incorporating Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian and Lydian scales together, while this young fella he's singing along with is just using some traditional scale since his voice isn't as versatile, he can't even comprehend the level of complexion in this virtuoso's music! Not even I, as a musician, can!\n\nThis little indie-guitarist James Hetfield lets us all know he identifies as a table by the end of the best song in this rehearsal. The View. It really is a stunning and brave statement in this highly technical mix of art-rock and traditional heavy metal that already has incredible themes like cutting your legs and tits off when seeing Boris Karloff and being spermless like a girl. In a society where merely being a chair or an ottoman can have you judged deeply, identifying as a table is... I can't even put it with words. Bravo, James Hetfield, bravo.\n\nThe more traditional sound of this small underground band Metallica is great. It really makes this record for uncultured listeners like myself that can't understand the genius that lays behind Lou's extremely technical and progressive music. I also heard they released some small demos in the 80s, shame these aren't as good as then. And if you're an idiot that pretends to enjoy poorly made music that disguises itself as exper- I mean if you're a highly seasoned listener of soft art-rock music, Lou's mind-shatteringly shi... good music will blow your mind and make your phallus explode.\n\nThe comedic value... I mean, the highly technical and progressive musical value of Lou's poetry and guitar playing that rivals the highest of high art is incredible, thus the 70% rating. Perhaps Metallica should also improve their own material a bit. But they're still young, I'm pretty sure they'll learn.\n\nRest in peace, Lou Reed. Hope your legs and tits are intact in heaven.\n",
        "\nI'd heard so much about this album from those who either like or are completely indifferent about it. I, on the other hand, really like half of it; I can wreck my neck to the crushing heaviness of 'Battery'. I like the intensity of 'Disposable Heroes'. I could listen to the really cool slide riff and middle-break in 'Leper Messiah,' on repeat \u2013 especially that middle-break. I love to crank up the volume when that part kicks in. And, 'Damage, Inc.' is a fast, heavy closer with a great riff in the middle. Those four songs would make an amazing E.P. I don't enjoy the rest of the album as much, though.\n\n'Battery' is an excellent opening thrasher, although, I'd prefer the clean intro to be on a separate track, just like Annihilator's 'Crystal Ann' from Alice in Hell. It affords me the option to skip or listen; that applies to the 'Damage. Inc' intro, as well. And, the title song starts well, with a classic riff, done by just about every rock and metal group in history. The legendary James Hetfield's relentless downpicking is great on it, though \u2013 boy, that guy could downpick like nobody's business. The song completely falls apart in the interlude section and some of the final trasitions are a little botched. A better example of this kind of shift in style would be something like Overkill's 'End of the Line'.\n\nThere are other songs which don't quite cut the mustard for me, as wel; most notably the slow, dull 'The Thing That Should Not Be'. WoW, it starts off really heavy, but runs out of ideas within the first few measures and it goes on way too long; self-editing and quality-control would barely exist on a Metallica album after '86. And, by comparison, other bands such as Overkill, Slayer, Megadeth and Kreator didn't do anything as dull as this in '86, 7 or 8. Then there's the almost compulsory track 4 ballad, ['Sanitarium'] which lacks the atmosphere and finale of Ride the Lighting's 'Fade to Black'. I like the initial opening, but it's a complete anticlimax in the last sections crescendo.\n\nThe parts of the album which are great really outweigh the one's which are not so good; both 'Leper Messiah' and 'Disposable Heroes' have some epic, lightning sections, which sound like the band from their Kill 'Em All days. If you think the middle-break on 'Battery' is alright, as I do, the one on 'Leper Messiah' is even better. The song goes from a chugging slide riff \u2013 very similar to the one on 'Ride the Lightning' \u2013 to a really epic clean section and some awesome thrash riffing. And, Hetfield's downpicking on 'Disposible Heroes' is outstanding; both songs are probably a verse or couple of measures too long, though. That's the self-editing issue starting to rear its ugly head.\n\nThis album isn't bad \u2013 it's not great, either. I just about prefer every song on Ride the Lightning, with the exception of 'Escape,' which I'd substitute for 'Leper Messiah'. And, even though I think the better songs on Master of Puppets are infinitely better than those on and... Justice for All, that album is more consistent, throughout. This is still classic Metallica and the following songs are essential listening on my playlist:\n\n01. Battery\n02. Disposable Heroes\n03. Leper Messiah\n04. Damage Inc. (excl. intro)\n",
        "\nMetallica's legendary fourth album, entry point to thrash for many people through its amazing songs, the epitome of thrash metal, and a very good example for songwriting and structure. You guessed it, And Justice For All. Undoubtedly, Metallica's best album and also one of the best albums in thrash, rivalled only by a select few masterpieces. This time they're here to take off that green paint from the halls of justice and distribute it to all. I just wish they left it at this and called it a day after their renowned live performance in Seattle.\n\nThe only people you find calling this album shit with a shit rhetoric themselves are the people who think hating Metallica is cool while listening to the worst that thrash has output themselves. Because it's coool!\n\nMetallica was a band that was not only thrash but above thrash, rivalled by almost none in this genre. This album only solidifies that position they used to have. It doesn't fall into any of the potential traps that plague nearly the entirety of the genre, whether it's generic, unoriginal songwriting or soulless, \"look at how tough I can sound with my stupid high-pitch voice\" kind of vocals. Not only that, but this also beholds some of the most emotional and meaningful pieces Metallica has ever written, namely \"One,\" \"Harvester of Sorrow\" and \"Dyers Eve.\"\n\nThe instrumentation is beyond this world, especially the guitars. The riffs are heavy, technically complex, very original and incredibly powerful. James Hetfield and Jason Newsted make wonders in songwriting here, especially when thrashing hard in Blackened and Dyers Eve. The guitars also sound incredible with a unique, low-end leaning tone, which should be an example for any modern band. Not only that, but most of the solos are also listenable and not random pentatonic garbage (or Dave's \"look at how fast I can shred\" stuff) unlike those in the records prior to this. The clean sections are unique and sound great thanks to their highly progressive elements. It's also great that you can hear the bass in those.\n\nRegarding the foundational instruments, the drums and the bass, they're the only problematic parts of this record. There's the massive problem of the bass not being present, and on a smaller scale, the drums being a tad bit too loud. I can understand why they'd cut out the bass since their guitar tone here already sounds like it's supplemented with bass, but it still creates a major hole when listening to this, especially as a musician. It's just ironic there's no justice for the bass in a record that's named And Justice For All. The drumming on the other hand sounds tight and is Ulrich's finest. While chaotic just like Ulrich's previous efforts, it's chaotic in a good sense here. A highlight to the bone-crushing drums in Dyers Eve.\n\nI cannot overstate how amazing Hetfield's vocals used to be. They were decent in Kill 'Em All, great in Ride The Lightning, an example for thrashers in Master Of Puppets and is a very good example for any musician in this record. The vocals are passionate, angry, perfectly placed in the mix, and sound amazing. He sounds pissed off at all times, and his calmer singing profound in One is also mesmerizing. His voice really sets the atmosphere for this record. It's almost perfect. His lyrics are also excellent, poetic and make good points regarding real issues that are still relevant. And no \"just a rhyme without a reason\" unlike the previous album.\n\nThe songwriting is great, the tones are amazing, and the sound is great. The bass is the only problem regarding the sound.\n\nI often only talk about uniquely good or otherwise notable tracks in albums instead of going over all of them one-by-one, but this album is full of classics. Here goes.\n\nThe album begins with the hypnotizing, unique intro of Blackened instantly thrashes you up without mercy around thirty seconds in. With its powerful primary riff, fast verses, strong chorus, exciting bridge and one of the best solos Kirk Hammett has ever written, the opening track Blackened is the best song in this album and best Metallica song overall. The follow-up tracks And Justice For All and Eye of the Beholder are slow and not that energetic, but they're okay and very cool to listen to the first few times. \"One\" is a half-ballad that gets very heavy halfway into the song. Its clean sections are beautiful and well-written, choruses are powerful and the first two solos are great. It only gets better after it gets heavy. The Shortest Straw is a cool thrasher, nothing much to say about it. Harvester of Sorrow, one of the slower tracks here is a real banger, with its powerful clean sections that blend in perfectly with the rougher sounds, overall heaviness of the track and the emotional music. To Live Is To Die is Metallica's either best or second-best instrumental, rivalled strongly by Orion. Dyers Eve is the album's second highlight after Blackened, with its fast, powerful, unique with its double-kick drumming, which is something Lars never does again, and filled with anguish through Hetfield's voice. The album ends quite abruptly with this, but it's a powerful ending regardless.\n\nIt's amazing. It shouldn't even be a debate, this is Metallica's best album.\n\nHighlights: Blackened, One, Harvester of Sorrow, Dyers Eve.\n",
        "\nMetallica. What can be said about them that hasn't been said hundreds of times before? Arguably one of the few bands that has as many fans as they do detractors, their musical endeavours span nearly 4 decades at this point, with albums that are considered classics by many. From the violent thrashing of Kill 'Em All, to the slower hard rock they put out during the 90s, to the much-reviled St. Anger, they've done it all. Seeing though the reception to St. Anger, they decided to take a rather long break, and in 2008 they came back with Death Magnetic. It was at the time celebrated as a comeback by many an old fan and considered a return to the glory days of the band. In 2020 though, a long time after its release, I decided to write about it, free of any biases towards the music and the hype that surrounded it when it originally came out.\n\nA slow heartbeat and an acoustic riff slowly build up anticipation, and \"That Was Just Your Life\" just starts blazing through with some quality thrashing riffs that immediately show us a band that has found the energy they lost for more than a decade at that point. With James singing with excitement and Hammett playing an actual solo that doesn't abuse the wah pedal. It really shows why people thought they came back stronger than ever when the album originally came out. \"The End of the Line\" continues in a similar fashion, and brings to mind \"Creeping Death\", or at the very least a slower version of it, with James' vocal cadence during the verses being the exact same. Starting off with these two tracks was without a doubt the best choice they could've made, though a tad misleading, seeing as what the rest of the album houses is quite different for the most part.\n\nThe midsection of the album houses some good tracks, and some middling ones. \"The Day That Never Comes\" and \"All Nightmare Long\" are arguably some of the best tracks on offer, and their positioning in the tracklist is quite nice as well. The former of the two is a power ballad that comes in after the first 3 and more aggressive songs here and offers a nice change of pace and its length is absolutely warranted, with the band slowly building up tension throughout its duration and releasing it at the end, with another great solo from Kirk and another great set of riffs. \"All Nightmare Long\" is another thrasher with a very nice intro, courtesy of Robert Trujillo, which manages to maintain interest during its almost 8 minute runtime.\n\nLike I said though, not all is perfect in that midsection, as there are tracks that left me completely unimpressed after they ended, those being \"Cyanide\" and \"The Unforgiven III\". \"Cyanide\" feels like a more boring version of the track that preceded it, maintaining a sluggish mid-paced tempo and lacking any interesting characteristics to it outside of the \"SOS\" riff at the start, which was an admittedly good idea. Shame it was wasted on that song. \"The Unforgiven III\" probably garnered a lot of groans at the time, being the third (and final) song in a trilogy that started back in 1991 with The Black Album. Frankly, while I don't consider it as egregiously bad as many people seem to do (It ranks in many \"Worst Metallica songs\" list online), and consider it better than \"The Unforgiven II\", I can't say that it has the impact a finale of a trilogy should've, though it does its best to end things on an epic note, with its use of an orchestra, which is a nice touch and something we hadn't seen on a studio release (S&M notwithstanding) since \"Nothing Else Matters\".\n\nSadly, things kinda fall apart near the end, where some of Metallica's most uninspired tracks lie. \"The Judas Kiss\" is a one-to-one replica of \"The End of the Line\", with its only saving grace being the chorus, which is quite energetic and dare I say exciting to sing along to. On the other hand we have \"Suicide & Redemption\", which is the first instrumental the band had written in 20 years, with their last at the time being \"To Live is to Die\" off ...And Justice For All. The band's longest song so far, just short of the 10 minute mark, and they decide to do absolutely nothing exciting nor interesting with it, opting instead to play some boring mid-paced riffs and aimlessly move around, never reaching the satisfying conclusion all instrumentals should have. The duration of songs is a problem that sadly permeate most of this album, and not just this particular song, which should've honestly be left on the cutting room floor along with the one before it.\"My Apocalypse\" tries cleaning up the mess the previous two songs left, being the shortest song at 5 minutes and just raging through with some high-octane riffing and not letting up for a single second, closing off the album in the best way possible.\n\nPerformance wise everyone seems to be in good form compared to what we had previously seen from them. James' voice doesn't sound as shot as it did in St. Anger, and doesn't crack as much as it did on that record, sadly time had taken its toll on it and it lacks the sheer power it had during the band's heyday. Kirk Hammett has for the most part escaped the trappings of Load and Reload, instead trying to play some solos without abusing the wah pedal, though it's not completely gone (See \"The Unforgiven III\"), and honestly, at this point I can't say it bothers me as much as it used to, seeing as his solos fit well on whatever track he plays them on. Robert Trujillo's bass playing is sadly underutilised and relegated to following the guitars for the most part, though he does have some moments where he makes his presence felt (the bass riff during the verses in \"Cyanide\" and the opening of \"Suicide & Redemption\"). Lars is well, Lars, playing random fills as per usual, and on occasion doing some double bass runs.\n\nThe production has rightfully been lambasted quite a bit, and is arguably where this album fails the most. Everything is insanely loud and competing for space at all times, which is a shame because there isn't anything inherently wrong with how the instruments sound, as they all sound full. The bass is just buried underneath the mess and struggles to be heard throughout most of the album's duration, and the snare is still too high in the mix, but thankfully this time it doesn't sound like someone banging on a cooking pot , which makes it slightly more tolerable.\n\nLyrically what we have here is James ruminating on fame and the fleeting nature of time (\"That Was Just Your Life, \"The End of the Line\"), as well as some more personal issues (\"The Day That Never Comes\", \"The Unforgiven III\"). They're decently written, with there being some rather questionable lines on some songs, namely \"Broken, Beat & Scarred\" (\"What don't kill you make you more strong\", really?! They're supposed to be native speakers for god's sake!). I've heard many people complain about the lyrics in Metallica's albums post-AJFA, but I can't say I'm upset in all honesty. James isn't in his 20s anymore and has grown quite old, he can't rant about war and politics forever.\n\nDeath Magnetic is an introspective album, where the band decides to look back on its legacy and tries to pick some of its best moments and use them in order to create something special that is geared towards long time fans, which is probably why it was such a resounding success when it originally came out. 12 years later though, the cracks have shown and while it was a massive improvement compared to the albums that they had released at that point, it still isn't a flawless release by any stretch. That being said, it's not something fans should sleep on, since there still are quite a few good tracks that bring to mind the band's glory days.\n\nHighlights: That Was Just Your Life, The End of the Line, The Day That Never Comes, All Nightmare Long\n",
        "\nAA more polished production work and a renewed sound characterized Metallica's sound in their sophomore effort. While certain influences from the NWOBHM are still present in this release, the band radically changed not only their musical direction but also how many thrash bands would set their sound. However, this revolutionary formula is not translated into brilliant work. It is average at its best, except for a couple of numbers. Furthermore, a relevant event is the departure of their guitarist and songwriter Dave Mustaine, which would impact the band's creative work, though he's been credited as a composer for a couple of tracks.\n\nMetallica bet for the creation of additional songwriting ideas. For instance, the introduction of a ballad and lengthier numbers seemingly aimed at stepping in the lands of progressive metal. The first two tracks result very promising. The powerful opening represents the album's finest hour; this tremendous thrasher runs in a fast fashion, keeping its pace at all times. The harmonic solos in the middle are also great. Then, the title track goes slower, though the chorus section speeds up a little bit, and there is also another awesome harmonic solo. \"Trapped Under Ice\" displays the last remains of the band's old sound, as it keeps certain similarities with \"Whiplash\" it also sounds excellent.\n\nThe rest of the album seems to fall down at moments. \"Fade to Black\" marks the beginning of a usual songwriting habit from this band: overlong ballads. The problem with them is that these ballads are filled with boring passages, and the band never realized how ridiculous they sound when they sing ball. The closing number is acceptable but turns out to be too lengthy, and you know what happens when the band deals with this kind of numbers. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is too dull as well. Five minutes for a song running at this pace is rather torturing, and it's too repetitive.\n\nThe offer is good at certain moments, but these guys fail when it comes to putting their new ideas in a trial by fire. This album shows the best version of their new sound, but it is still too short when all is said and done. The most worrying aspect of the allegedly renewed formula is how Metallica exploited the same in the next releases, as they were bringing out watered-down variations and prioritizing their worst ideas. It is widely recommendable to play the vinyl format of this album for a better listening experience.\n\n\nYou can also read this review in: http://antichristmagazine.com/review-metallica-ride-the-lightning-megaforce-records/\n",
        "\nThere's a concept called Hauntology, it's got a lot of waft about it, but one basic way of describing it is nostalgia for lost futures. Like how the present day, instead of having space travel and the end of scarcity and travel to Mars and shit there's cops shooting black dudes like the 60s never left, the planet is getting cooked and Bezos is racking up billions like it's pocket change while other people die because they can't afford insulin. \n\nMark Fisher wrote a good book on it. Anyway, you can kinda apply the concept to Metallica, sorta, and on S&M2 it's here in full view. \n\nS&M2 gets me nostalgic for a non existent time when Metallica did the Loads (maybe it happened after AJFA, the self titled, whatever) and then realized that they had money enough for seven lifetimes and went right off the deep end, releasing stranger and stranger albums, the fanbase steadily leaving them, the band caring less and less etc. In this lost future Metallica haven't played Enter Sandman for 20 years, and Frayed Ends of Sanity is now 30 minutes long and takes up half their set. What I'm getting at here (in as slow and pretentious a manner as possible) is that the weirder stuff on S&M2 is really interesting, not always GOOD (All Within My Hands, the one good St Anger gets thoroughly ruined by an acoustic treatment) but at least interesting, and it's nice to imagine what coulda been if they'd embraced it a bit more, if Metallica weren't so committed to going down their safe but rather unsatisfying late career trajectory. \n\nThe upright bass version of Pulling Teeth is far more interesting than the original, it's not perfect but it is quite cool, Unforgiven III's symphonic makeover is both a bit awkward, kinda neat, genuinely heartfelt and unlike anything these guys have done. Halo on Fire was perhaps the best choice from Hardwired and works great. Outlaw Torn and Ktulu are the two best really really long songs these dudes have ever done, the former benefiting maybe more than any other tune from the symphony's extra colour and depth; both these marvelous, sweeping soundscapes and it's nice they're back again for the 2nd S&M. None of these tunes are gonna be competing with Justice For All as far as playcounts go but that's fine. They're trying new shit, they're not just treading water. Iron Foundry a very cool idea as well, with Metallica accompanying the orchestra, instead of the other way around.\n\nThe rest, well. You've got Enter Sandman for the millionth time. It's exactly how you imagine it, more or less. Same with One, the double bass steadily getting worse throughout the years, and a very not good arrangement that strips much of the tension from the cold, calculated original. Picking Confusion and The Day That Never Comes for the gig is a real headscratcher when Spit out The Bone doesn't get a roll in; both deep cuts that no one feels all that strongly for, might as well've include some Reload obscuros while we're here. I'm not convinced I'm musical enough to really critique the orchestral arrangements but there's problems here too. The old Kamen ones from S&M are definitely more interesting than the S&M2-only ones, which tend to just flirt around the edges of the songs and often just disappear into the mix. That said it's a shame that (from what I can tell) the Kamen ones are more or less here with no alterations. Yeah, Outlaw Torn sounds great with the Kamen arrangement. MoP and Roam and particular One sound like garbage. Why not change it up a bit?\n\nWhy not write a few songs designed to fit with an orchestra? Spend a year or two with a composer, you guys are Metallica, you can afford that shit. You can have a composer on your payroll and you wouldn't notice it. Why not fuck off Sandman, which didn't work all that great the first time, and put a cooler, riskier choice in? It's fair to say that S&M2 is a fans only release, very much so, which makes the amount of predictable, boring hits such a head scratcher. \n\nOverall, the whole package is a bit of a blue balls kinda deal. Good production, the artwork is decent. As much a frustrating \"what could've been\" kinda experience as anything. File under fans only kinda thing.\n",
        "\nTwenty years after the first collaboration between thrash metal veterans and the San Francisco Symphony, the exercise has been repeated and now been released with some delay due to the coronavirus pandemic. The combination between heavy metal and classical music was still rather unusual two decades ago but nowadays many bands have collaborated with choirs, orchestras and symphonies. The main issue of this release is that Metallica simply repeats the same exercise it had already done two decades ago without adding anything new to the formula. Even the two set lists are quite similar and this release is only interesting for fans of old date for the six tunes from the past three studio albums and perhaps the courageous interpretation of the instrumental ''(Anesthesia) \u2013 Pulling Teeth''.\n\nThe final result is quite mixed to be honest. Some songs work well in the additional symphonic arrangements that add depth, dynamics and soundscapes. ''The Day That Never Comes'' sounds even more dramatic, epic and sad than the original version and is the first highlight of the show. ''The Memory Remains'' doesn't only work due to a homogeneous effort by the band and the symphony but also due to excellent crowd participation which makes this track the most vibrant song of the entire record. ''All Within My Hands'' has been transformed from an angry modern thrash metal song into a simpler, shorter and calmer sinister country ballad that sounds truly surprising. ''Master of Puppets'' sounds incredibly energetic and reminds of the heaviness of Richard Wagner and the likes which makes for the heaviest tune of the bunch.\n\nOther songs simply don't work in the symphonic context. The classical instruments overload ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' and reduce its atmospheric vibes instead of adding new dynamics to it. ''One'' sounds quite chaotic and the almost joyful orchestral sounds don't fit with the bleak core of this desperate tune at all which makes for the worst effort on the output. ''Enter Sandman'' both overstays its welcome and the symphony doesn't add anything noteworthy to the song, becoming a gimmicky addition doodeling in the background.\n\nThe energy of the crowd and passion of the involved musicians from both sides are genuine. However, the overlong speeches and interpretations of classical music unrelated to the thrash metal veterans are filler material that can't even convince fans of this specific type of music. The band and the symphony should have transformed one or two more obscure tracks from the thrash metal veterans' past instead.\n\nThe final result is a mixed bag with some great homogeneous efforts and a few nerve-firing clashes. The concert's experimental elements work out for the tribute to Cliff Burton but can't convince when attempting to reinterpret genuine classical compositions. In the end, S&M 2 can only be recommended to fans of the original project, avid collectors and perhaps some people who have never listened to the first collaboration and are only discovering this interesting clash of thrash metal and classical music as we speak.\n",
        "\nFor the past few days I was mulling over what I should cover next and the very obvious answer I had was picking Metallica\u2019s highly influential debut, \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d. For an album that has had so much coverage and multiple different takes from multiple different people; it puts me off a little to come up with something that will stand on its own against the back drop of voices but I hope to try my best. Coming slap dab in the middle of summer 1983, Metallica came out of the gates running with an album that many would call one of the greatest metal albums of all time, some expressing that it is the greatest. Now I do think it\u2019s one of the greatest and it\u2019s influence is widespread but I\u2019m not one to think it is the best, let alone the best thrash metal debut, but I do believe it is a tremendous album and an album that helped pave the way for the genre as a whole. \n\nTo begin, if there is a way to describe what \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d is, it is in all of its 80s glory a \u201craw, furious thrasher\u201d. Fueled by NWOBHM and classic metal / rock with a dash of punk aggression, all the contents are mixed together in a caldron of sonic proportions only to great the dish named, thrash metal. Ok yeah I know that there is some contention and debate on \u201cwho REALLY put out the first thrash metal album\u201d but what really matters is that this album, along with Slayer\u2019s debut a few months later, was what put thrash on the map. The album is unpolished, distorted, and raw but still retains a charm to it. Matter of fact, as I re-listen to it in full today here in 2020, I notice how well it still sounds and how much it holds up. The guitars are nice and loud, the drums back a punch but not overbearing, the bass is loud enough to be heard but at places I do wish it was higher in the mix, and Hetfields shrieky, angsty vocals is in central focus here, but just like the drums in the production it isn\u2019t over shadowing the instrumentation. So yeah, besides the bass being a tad bit low in places, the overall production is pretty great for a debut and packs a bunch of sound. \n\nFor the better part of \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d, Metallica\u2019s focus is on NWOBHM influenced riffs but sped up ten times faster. \u201cHit The Lights\u201d is the perfect representation for my statement, as it has a clear Iron Maiden influence with its galloping rhythm but with the tempo dial turned up a notch. If slowed down a little, I could see \u201cHit The Lights\u201d ending up on one of Iron Maiden\u2019s early albums honestly. The majority of the album is like a literal speed rollercoaster; speeding down the tracks more than they slowly go up them. Besides \u201cHit The Lights\u201d; \u201cWhiplash\u201d, \u201cMotorbreath\u201d, \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d, \u201cMetal Militia\u201d all offer that same energy as the riffs and solos spill out in a quick pace but there is some variety here that isn\u2019t all just quick riffing as Metallica does offer some mid-paced performances. \u201cJump In The Fire\u201d, \u201cNo Remorse\u201d, and \u201cSeek & Destroy\u201d all fit that mid-paced bill with influences ranging from Mot\u00f6rhead to Diamond Head sprouting from the seems; giving us the listeners some breathing room. Hell if you were to really slow down \u201cSeek & Destroy\u201d, I could see that as something Black Sabbath could have written. Metallica also adds little moments between songs where a melodic break or a melodic solo happens which I feel adds more to the song than being a straight forward speed thrasher. \n\nA nice outlier from \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d is the late Cliff Burton\u2019s bass solo in \u201c(Anesthesia)- Pulling Teeth\u201d. It is very experimental and totally different from everything else on the album that I couldn\u2019t not stop and talk about it individually. I really love that buildup towards the 2 minute mark, then the rest of the instruments kicking in but not overtaking the bass. It\u2019s a stand out in Cliff\u2019s short career and definitely a standout here. Back to the album as a whole, I will say that it isn\u2019t the most technical or complex in nature. The riffing follows a basic path and pattern, not verging much off from the well placed solos and the occasional melodic break or melodic solo that I\u2019ve mentioned. Some think that \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u2019s\u201d simplicity here is a negative but I don\u2019t share those views. It\u2019s easy for someone now to say \u201cwell look at all these albums that have come out since then, this is piss easy compared to them\u201d but just look at when this came out, this album was very much different from what was going on and helped set a standard for the upcoming thrash genre. Even then, \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d may not be as complex or technically impressive, it sure as hell is a lot more memorable as a whole compared to a plethora of albums. So yeah, just because something is simple doesn\u2019t make it bad, moving on.\n\nGetting to our lineup, James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Cliff Burton, and Lars Ulrich all preform fantastically, for the most part. James\u2019s performance here is very much different from how he sings on later albums as he is much more raw here. He\u2019s just full of screeches and shrieks as he more so yells at you than he does sing at you. He does have some more melodic singing like he\u2019d utilize on later albums, such as in \u201cNo Remorse\u201d and \u201cSeek & Destroy\u201d but for the most part stays pretty powerful and raw in \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d. James is also on rhythm guitar and his skill is excellent here as he keeps up with Kirk\u2019s impeccable leads. Cliff Burton is fantastic here as his bass lines really help shape the songs and give the music a extra dimension. Fun fact, Cliff\u2019s only writing credit here is\u201c(Anesthesia)- Pulling Teeth\u201d as he would join the band shortly before the recording of the debut. Never less, his performance here is a stand out in the genre and he\u2019d only get better with his next release. \n\nKirk Hammett is a monster on the lead guitar and his early solo work is something that is hard for a lot of musicians to match now. What else makes Kirk\u2019s solos top notch here and in early Metallica albums is how catchy those verses are. You just listen to the onslaught in \u201cSeek & Destroy\u201d or the beginning of \u201cNo Remorse\u201d and not tell me that doesn\u2019t want to make you shack head with the rhythm. Then there\u2019s Lars Ulrich who gets the job down remaining consistent throughout. The drumming is not really complicated here on \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d nor has Lars ever been a standout drummer for me but he does do a great job on the studio albums, at least the early ones, but the less said about his...live performances, the better. \n\nI guess the last thing I should mention is the elephant in the room; good ol\u2019 Davey Mustainey. It would be disservice not to talk about Dave\u2019s contributions for Metallica as he did greatly help shape their sound early on. You know his distinct style of writing when you hear \u201cJump In The Fire\u201d, \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d, \u201cMetal Militia\u201d and \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d as those songs have a little more, technicality to it? More meat and bones to the riffing I suppose? I mean you just listen to that melodic solo and the slow melodic break in \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d and you know that Dave\u2019s sweaty fingers were all over it. In the end, I\u2019m glad that Dave was fired from the band as it gave us some of the best riff writing and solos in the genre over in the Megadeth camp.\n\nSo after all of this long winded rambling, what is my final verdict on \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d? Well I personally think this a fantastic record and a fantastic debut. The album is memorable from beginning to end as Metallica handles catchiness and aggressive speed in tandem as if they were from different sides of the same coin. Their stance on the metal way of life and the lyrical subject matter is something the thrash genre still writes about, even after almost 40 years since this album released. Sure, there are some stuff that could be fixed or changed, like upping Cliff\u2019s bass in the mix or cutting some time down in \u201cNo Remorse\u201d but as a whole, \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d just fucking slays. It\u2019s simple (for the most part) in its writing but difficult in its execution and Metallica definitely executes. I may not hold \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d as my favorite thrash debut, that title belongs to \u201cFeel The Fire\u201d, but the exceptional skills and memorability at play are something many can\u2019t say they can repeat and with how successful and influential \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d became, it deserves every bit of it.\n",
        "\nWell here's the infamous 'Lulu' turd of an album I just had to review. I decided to try to listen to most of it and I barely got through. There were so many times where I had to turn it off. And mostly because of how stupid Lou Reed sounds. That was the major problem as most people know who have heard this album. I still don't understand why this wasn't an instrumental album with Lou Reed doing some cool guitar solos or him and Kirk Hammett could have been trading off solos. I think that would have been a way smarter idea. As soon as he starts speaking that's when it self destructs. And there are times his voice goes off key is that on purpose? What the hell is he trying to do? It's really bad man.\n\nAnd as most of the reviews have said about this album...the length of the songs are ridiculously way longer than they should be. 3 of the songs fall into the 5 minute mark and that's the length they should've made all the songs. If the rest of the songs were cut down especially the longer songs it would have made a big difference I'm telling you. I understand that bands want to try to do different things and that's interesting but I think Metallica did that in the 90s. And to try something that was so out of left field with Lou Reed who sounds so horrible and pathetic on this turd like I said before just boggles the mind. He honestly sounds like he took a big hit of acid. Then he figured he could talk over the music and sound like a nutcase. And some people find that artistic? What the fuck???\n\nI like poetic and abstract lyrics that may not make sense but have an atmosphere to them. A lot of bands have lyrics that are weird but colorful. But these lyrics are so bad and ridiculously cringe-worthy I can't believe Lou Reed actually wrote them. What the fuck was going on in his head when he wrote these words??? I really want to know. And what's most shocking is that the band or the producer didn't say anything about it. If that was me in the band I would have told Lou Reed that you need to change these lyrics no question. And some of the song titles too. 'Junior Dad' and 'Iced Honey' stand out as atrocious titles that make no sense whatsoever. I've always believed song titles make a difference in any band. If you have a great song don't ruin it with a stupid title. Bands from all genres have done that and it's stupid. Especially on this album for sure. I guess they couldn't think of better titles when they should have. \n\nAnd what about the songs themselves? Metallica used to be a band that could write 8 minute songs that were great and kept you interested for that length of time. But with this album they just drag the same riff on and on and it's ridiculous. There's hardly any variety in the riffs that's the problem. And the riffs themselves are bland and stale. Especially on the last song 'Junior Dad' which is 20 minutes long. They ride on 2 riffs for the first half and then they have some ambient noise going on for the second half. Absolute garbage man. If they'd cut it down to 4 minutes like I said it would've worked. Just as most of the songs should've been. They just sit on one riff and ride it for way too long and it's just absolutely asinine. I just can't believe that this album even made it to the recording stage because who the hell thought this was a good idea? I guess Metallica had nothing better to do then to work with Lou Reed and create this abomination. Somebody must have because it exsists when it shouldn't have end of story. Maybe if their manager had told them this wasn't such a good idea they should have listened to him. It could have saved the embarrassment of having this album tied to your legacy. Not a very good choice at all. You know that stain thats so bad on your shirt that it'll never come out no matter how many times you wash it? This album is that stain on Metallica's career and it's there forever. And what the shame is that it could've been fixed so easily. Cut the songs down to 3 to 4 minutes take Lou Reed's voice out and there you go. It might have saved it I would hope...\n\nThere's been a lot of reviews about the production of the album not being good I don't think that's true. You could actually hear the guitars and drums and the vocals but the bass should have been louder definitely. But still it can't save this abomination because it's already down the sewer and you can't rescue it. It just really goes to show you that maybe they don't care anymore. And as for James Hetfield? He does background vocals that sound so lame and uninspired. Even his voice sounds stale and just tired and going through the motions. Maybe he regrets doing this album I would really like to know. And what's sad to me is that there are people who bought this album because they're loyal to Metallica no matter what. I admire that loyalty but even with my favorite bands if they put out a bad album that I don't like I'm not buying it period. This is beyond bad my friends just beyond...\n\nI saw an interview with Lars Ulrich a few years ago. And he said that when Lou Reed asked them to be a back-up band on this album he basically said that it was hard to say no. Well Lars you could have just turned around and said no we want to write something that's going to be meaningful and well thought out. We want to go back to our roots and put out something that was going to show the fans that we don't forget where we came from. And now you're going to have to live with this pathetic \nlp for the rest of your life Mr. Lars and you don't seem to care. There was once upon a time when Metallica was hungry and then once the big money comes in and you start softening your sound up to sell more records that's the beginning of the end. And then to come back with a good album like Death Magnetic was a step in the right direction. But then to shoot yourself in the foot with this piece of shit really is sad. You would think they would have learned their lesson by trying to correct their path after that Saint Anger crap lp but i guess not. Now they have 2 stains on their career that they'll never live down. Could this lp be one of the biggest disgraces in music history? Not sure but it's a top contender.\n",
        "\nAll movements have a beginning and an end, and in the peculiar case of heavy metal's second wave, the beginning was far less clearly defined than its end. Granted, the label of heavy metal is meant in a more general sense, subsuming several of its various sub-genres into one collective whole, and yes, even uniting the disparate parties that made up the fun-loving sounds of the sunset strip and the nastier grime of the thrash metal scene. At the center of this movement was Metallica, a band that didn't so much start the second wave given their relatively late arrival when compared to the booming NWOBHM that came roaring out of the British Isles in the late 70s, but somehow managed to have one foot firmly placed in heavy metal traditionalism while simultaneously expanding the genre's sonic possibilities. As a pioneering figure of the thrash metal scene, they would often find themselves taking a middle road between the smoother demeanor of arena-oriented, image-based outfits dominating the mainstream end of metal, while also shying away from full embracing the extreme character that Slayer and other fringe players that were feeding off earlier works to varying degrees by the mid-80s. But it was at the tail end of things, at metal's proverbial twilight time in the early 90s that this iconic outfit would truly embody the middle of the metal road, and consequently achieve mega-stardom as a result.\n\nContrary to a fairly popular opinion, metal didn't reach the end of its initial run as a mainstream phenomenon with Metallica's eponymous fifth studio entry, but rather with the subsequent tour that would drag on for nearly 5 years. The ultimate fruit of this massive venture in worldwide metal evangelism was a massive box set aptly dubbed Live Shit: Binge & Purge, spanning two grueling live sets in San Diego and Mexico City, along with an older one in Seattle from the ...And Justice For All tour in 1989 and a number of other assorted merchandise. It could be best understood as the ultimate fan collection for the casual metal consumer, featuring most of Metallica's seminal work translated through the era when they were at their peak popularity. James Hetfield's vocals are nestled firmly within the upper mid-range baritone gruff character that was featured on The Black Album, as is the peculiar combination of thunderous drum sounds and chunky bass work that gave said album its heavy character and mainline appeal. Even the rawer material from Kill 'Em All has a smoothed out early 90s swagger to it, despite being played at the same rapid pace. The material from the earlier concert in Seattle naturally differs a bit in that its a bit less polished while also being a bit more faithful to the original versions of the songs featured, and shines ever so brighter as a result.\n\nGiven the massive well of material there was to draw from, the entire culmination of viewing and listening material found here being consumed in a single sitting could rival a binge watching session of the average television series. Surprisingly enough, despite each concert running in excess of 150 to 210 minutes of intense metallic thunder and between song tomfoolery and crowd hyping, these four musicians would showcase a superhuman level of stamina in how effortlessly they keep the pedal to the metal for so long. In all fairness, Hetfield often shies away from the higher-pitched material on the pre-1988 material, and throws several bits of chorus material to the audience as a pacing device, which serves to give the listening experience a bit more of an organic character, as if one is actually at the concert viewing from one of the balcony seats. A few of the rawer offerings like \"Seek And Destroy\" and \"Whiplash\" on the Mexico City performance feature Jason Newstead taking on a greater vocal role, and his throaty shouts are all but identical to that of Hetfield's. Interestingly enough, one of the greatest moments of the Mexico City performance is when Newstead goes off on his bass solo following the \"Justice Medley\", cycling through several variations of the \"My Friend Of Misery\" bass line and building up into a technical display that rivals his predecessor Cliff Burton's handiwork.\n\nThere aren't really any slouch moments to speak of on any of the three concerts represented here, and instances of temporary weakness are sparsely encountered. There are a few moments such as the tapping guitar solo passage during the intro of \"Am I Evil?\" where Kirk Hammett's timing is a bit off, but apart from this and a few points where Lars' drumming has a few subtle hiccups, it's a straight shot of high octane goodness that just keeps on coming and coming. Truth be told, Kir's lead playing is in top form throughout and sees him reproducing just about every original solo to the last note, while Lars' drumming itself is a tad choppy at times, but his overall tone is so colossal and just works so well that it's almost impossible to care. Likewise, James Hetfield's approach to interacting with the audience comes off as a bit clownish and juvenile, even when compared to the incessant potty mouth that was often heard out of Dee Snider during Twisted Sister's early tours, as counting the number of seemingly pointless F-bombs interwoven with James' words could compare to one of the Seven Labors of Hercules. Nevertheless, while his approach is a bit less gallant than that of Ronnie James Dio and less good-natured than that of Bruce Dickinson, it plays to the crowd quite well and does inspire the occasional chuckle a full 27 years after the fact.\n\nFor better or worse, this would be the final word not only in classic Metallica's highly lionized early run, but also that of the entire metal scene as it existed since the onset of the NWOBHM, at least as a mainstream cultural phenomenon. It exemplifies what made Metallica and the music that spawned them so great, but also presents it in such a massive and potent dose that it can't really be followed. It's a testament that for whatever would be said about the music that would fill the void that would commence in subsequent years, victory was ultimately what defeated metal. Like any articulation of unrestrained greatness, this collection is not for everyone, though it has a far wider appeal than most individual albums by other bands would to those who consider metal a part time curiosity rather than a way of life. It's occupies an odd sort of middle point between that of a pop culture phenomenon and an exclusive experience reserved for only the most die-hard of fans. It's a massive time commitment, but it's something that anyone interested in what metal was prior to the late 1990s should hear and see at least once. It presents Metallica at their apex, shouting profane jokes and metallic fury to the four winds from a mighty mountain's peak. They would never reach this height again, arguably because they opted to milk the success that came with it to death, but metal has always been an exercise in excess, and few offerings could ever hope to top this in said department.\n",
        "\nThe prevailing sentiment regarding 2020 goes along the lines of it being the worst year ever, at least for people who aren't introverted shut-ins of the Gen X persuasion like yours truly. But rioting ninjas and a worldwide embracing of agoraphobia aside, this present year has been far from a crap shoot wherein metal studio output is concerned, with the exception of a growing practice of bands doing awkward and generally terrible live performances from home using video sharing software. There's just something about the comfort of being in one's own house that tends to inspire laziness and a nonchalant approach to things, but low expectations tend to breed subpar trends, and far be it for a fold of underachievers with a vast audience like Metallica to miss out on catering to the latest craze. Nevertheless, while a mostly acoustic rendition of a late 80s beast of a thrasher in \"Blackened\" scores high on the bad idea scale, it proves to fall a tad short of the worst thing to come out of both post-80s Metallica and also the current \"metal under house arrest\" niche.\n\nTo dispense with the obvious, this rendition is virtually unrecognizable when compared to the original apart from the lyrical content, and arguably its greatest flaw is the clash between the lighter musical traits of this version and darker words it surrounds. The atmosphere of this performance sort of frolics back and forth between being melancholy and mystical, occasionally giving off a subtle Middle Eastern vibe, but largely coming off as a sort of somber blues ballad with a slightly up tempo feel. The more droning acoustic line put forth by Hetfield that has replaced the vertebrae-smashing principle riff of the original sounds closer to the dreary clean guitar line of \"Harvester Of Sorrow\", while Kirk's mellow electric guitar chime-ins vacillate between the bluesy noodling he exhibited on \"Enter Sandman\" and his slightly disjointed but surprisingly animated guitar solo sounds like a reject version of his original \"Wherever I May Roam\" solo minus all the wah pedal noise. In essence, the guitar work on here proves to be this revamp's strong suit.\n\nThough this reworking of what some might assume a sacred relic of the golden age of thrash metal reminds a bit more of something that might have been a b-side on a single from the eponymous 5th album than an outright abortion from the era that followed, it does come with a healthy supply of problems. Curiously enough, the rhythmic backdrop provided by Lars and Trujillo is largely inoffensive and appropriately restrained, though the former's tone is a bit abrasive at times for what is essentially a ballad, betraying his obvious limitations as a drummer even by the standards of what amounts to a basic AC/DC styled beat. The ultimate downfall of this song, however, is Hetfield's extremely timid and anti-climactic vocal performance. He essentially takes a more haggard version of the airy croon that was employed on \"Nothing Else Matters\" and applies it to 90% of the vocal content, interweaving some harmonic interplay with the music that veers further away from the grittiness of the original, but ultimately coming off as lifeless and inappropriately melding an aged and nuanced performance with lyrics that were penned by a rebellious thrasher in his mid-20s.\n\nIt might seem like a cop-out to assert that this isn't as bad as many have made it out to be, but that's largely where this thing rests in my estimation, like 5 minutes of subpar background music as opposed to nails on a chalkboard. That being said, it's still well below what these middle-aged veterans are capable of, and the excuse of them simply getting old doesn't really cut it when you look at what some artists who were rocking out while most of Metallica were still trick or treating have been putting out of late. People have been saying that Metallica were too old to be thrashing back in the days of Reload, yet a simple perusal of what they laid down on 2016's Hardwired...To Self-Destruct tells a very different story. One can only hope that Hetfield and company can manage another album like that without hitting the bottle again, because even though he's fresh off of cancer treatment, Dave Mustaine could easily wipe the floor with this weak offering in a single day's worth of studio time.\n",
        "\nIn 1988, Metallica released their fourth album \"...and Justice for All\". One of the songs in the album is called \"Blackened\". Being the first track to their first progressive metal album, it's a great opening. From the memorable guitar riffs to James Hetfield's signature vocals, and the good bass play from the then-recently recruited Jason Newsted, \"Blackened\" is one of the best songs off the album.\n\nNow why am I talking about this? In the year where the world is being infected by a pandemic, the band decided to release a modern remix of the song back in May. Normally, I don't have a problem with Metallica doing remixes, as they have done some great remixes before, like the remix to Thin Lizzy's \"Whiskey in the Jar\". With this remix, however, it sucks. At best, it's a watered-down version to a good song. At worst, it's a failed attempt at renewing it and should've been scrapped altogether. It's stuff like this that makes me wonder why I still look forward to the band's newest releases.\n\nOne problem I had with the single is the vocals. James goes for a singing style in the remix. That idea sounds good on paper, but it is executed poorly. His voice sounds limited on the track, and he doesn't put maximum effort in the singing. He also sounds a bit strained in some parts of the song, and at times, it seems as if his singing is forced. In comparison, the original 1988 track included Hetfield's shouts and chants that he is more famous for, and the voice flows nice with the fast instruments. In the 2020 version, the vocals don't flow as well with the instruments.\n\nSpeaking of which, the instruments are a let down. We start off the remix with an acoustic guitar playing the original guitar riff. It sounds pretty good, as it offers a more relaxed sound. When the other instruments come in, however, it starts to fall apart. The drums are an exact copy of the original version, and they lack the power they once had, giving the overall sound of the drums a dull sound. The bass also has a similar problem, where it sounds bland and dry. The instruments overall bring more of a \"Nothing Else Matters\" atmosphere in the remix. While I didn't enjoy NEM as much as other people had, I can at least see that the band did put some effort into the instrumentals. Here, it sounds like they half-assed the production, so the overall sound of the instruments are dull and boring.\n\nLastly, the lyrics don't fit in to the sound at all. The lyrics are about the Earth dying as it's being covered in violence and destruction. The AJFA version executes these lyrics well with the aggressive sound of the instruments and James's screaming vocals. In the 2020 version, the acoustic guitar and soft instruments are out of place for these brutal lyrics. The lyrics are still good, but the execution of them in the remix is poor.\n\nOverall, this single was a complete waste of time. James's vocals don't pack as much of a punch, the instruments are neutered and sound flat, and the lyrics are not welcome in this calm atmosphere. It's one of the most forgettable singles Metallica has ever put out, and it's a shame, since they could've made the remix sound awesome had they actually tried. Metallica is set to release the sequel to \"S&M\" in August 28, but if this is the direction they want to go in their next live album, then I'm not so optimistic in their future.\n",
        "\nBefore I listened to this I wasn't inclined to hate on this over much. Pretty confident it was gonna be awful, couldn't see such a riff driven song working acoustically, but yknow, dudes are allowed to goof off, right? That was an age ago now though. Back when I was INNOCENT. Even though I heard the song for free, I'd still like my money back.\n\nWhere to start.. where to start. We can start with the vocals, with James sounding like he's scared of singing, a half whispered, half murmured kinda thing. It would be bad completely stripped of context but is pretty wretched when you think of how this song was first delivered 32 odd years ago. It's also a reminder that blackened's fairly straight ahead vocal lines don't work when you're trying to gently sing them. The drums are another point you could begin with, I've never really hated Lars but his basic slugging of the drums just shows his complete limitation and lack of flexibility as a drummer. He just doesn't have the skillset to deliver a nuanced performance.. never has, and on a song like this it's painfully obvious. We can start with the massive foolishness of picking a song that relies on energy, distorted guitars and a very unacoustic riff set and attempting to do an unplugged version. Give us a cover! Give us, I dunno, something off Load, give us a weird medley where you get Fade to Black but insert the quiet part of To Live is To Die in there. There's a lot of options, and most of them are much better than this.\n\nIf you can ignore the horrible vocals, the very average drumming, and Kirk's \"hopefully that was a first take\" contributions, the song would maybe be a 50%. The acoustic arrangement is not terrible, it definitely isn't GREAT but it's passable. The opening riff rearranged sounds vaguely exotic, the rest is adequate, just a bustling, vaguely folky, occasionally country-ish thing. I like how they throw in a bunch of natural harmonics and shit. So yeah, with a drummer who understood dynamics, if you completely changed the vocal line, if you replaced Kirk with someone else, so on and so forth.. it might be good. But that's a bit of a meaningless point, isn't it? \"If you changed everything about the song, it could work\".\n\nI've heard the Ja Rule collab, I've heard Lulu, St.Anger, etc. This is still easily the worst thing Metallica have ever put out. Goofing off or not, it's still complete garbage.\n",
        "\nReally two years ago I used to dickride Metallica, they were in my podium of favorite bands for a lot of time, I of course got to recognize they gave us some rat crap (or Lars' crap, both animals are pretty much looking like) but I was really happy listening to them, well I still am and I respect Metallica a lot but seriously I've been so disappointed at them lately, not just for the music but also other topics related to the band. But I'm here to tell you what do I think of this song. Let's begin with this: I had to listen to it like 6 times because I couldn't finish it, it was really boring and I always ended up by playing something better just to clean my ears, but finally I could stand the whole song. My first impressions are Lars Ulrich not being able to play a decent riff in other time signature than 4/4 anymore, he just beats the shit out of the snare and it's another tempo signature for him, the drum beat in the whole verse is stupidly confusing, I fucking got lost in some parts.\n\nThe original \"Blackened\" song is something I love and I could have in a shrine, the song is a solid 10/10 for me, my second favorite song from the \"...And Justice For All\" album, just behind the legendarily amazing masterpiece \"Dyers Eve\" is. The way these dudes (except for Robert Trujillo, honestly he never disappoints and personally I believe he's the best bassist Metallica ever had, his technique is great) fucked up this song makes my blood boil. James Hetfield's voice... well he's old and of course his voice is dying but that's forgivable, and actually it's not that bad, he's a good vocalist, I think I like more his vocals than his abilities on guitar, or at least in live performances it is like that, dude he can't even play his own licks. Speaking about guitars, oh man here comes something destructive, WHAT IN THE EVERLIVING CRISPY DIVINE INSANE FUCK WAS THAT SOLO? I mean, I call it solo but it can perfectly be called as ass pain, or a 3-year old kid playing guitar but sped up so it can sound like he's playing a fast solo. Hammett in the solos sucks even more as he gets older, can you recall Ride The Lightning or Master Of Puppets solos? Yeah, mesmerizing, energizing, and now think of this... just... There's no word in the English language nor another language over this world's face to describe how disgraceful, nasty, horrible and SHITTY overall this clump of notes was.\n\nAs it's a single and not a whole album I can't say too much about it, I would like to say something good but really I can't find something that makes me happy about this work. Robert Trujillo's basslines are good but of course he tries the best he can on this aberrant rhythm he has been forced to play over. It is like \"Disposable Heroes\" in that acoustic concert thy released on February of 2019, it was called something like \"All Within My Hands: Live at The Masonic\" I believe, I'm not sure. The original one is an amazing song, eight orgasmic minutes, now all fucked up in the acoustic version in a single time signature during the whole song, and it doesn't fit at all with the style of the original song. Where's the aggressiveness? Please I don't want something like this again, I promise I can accept opinions that I don't agree with but I can't stand how some people that know the original song and like it also liked this.\n\nIn conclusion we have two options:\n\n1. Listening to \"Blackened 2020\".\n\n2. Butchering your fingers with a nail clipper and uncork your glans with your own teeth (and haven't brushed them in 10 weeks) then having an infection that won't kill you, so you will suffer in pain and agony for days that you will want to tear the skin of your face off so you do it and you also pour some salt on it and lemon extract in your eyes while you push some broken glass pieces against them.\n\nI would choose the second one without hesitation.\n\nIt's really hard for me to say this when we speak about one of my favorite bands but you can't just be a fanboy or a fangirl and say that everything they do is the best because they did it. Before this song there were like 20 bands I liked more than Metallica, now after this shit that number ascends to 50 probably. So disappointing, Metallica, even though I expect you to do more stuff like this, I also have some faith that you're going to at least write a good song on your next new works. Meanwhile, fuck this.\n",
        "\nAfter the success of \"Kill 'Em All\", Metallica released their second album a year later in 1984. While many would find their next album \"Master of Puppets\" the best album Metallica made, I found MOP a bit of a watered down version of RTL. It's not only Metallica's best album, but I consider this the best thrash metal album of all time.\n\nWhile I enjoyed \"Kill 'Em All\", I did found some flaws on the album. RTL takes those flaws and improves them. The guitars have more power in them, the drums have more variety in the kicks and bangs, the bass is more clearer, and the vocals bring more emotions in the songs with more anger and dramatic shouts. Because of this, every single song off the album has their own style that makes them memorable. From the intro song \"Fight Fire with Fire\" with it's sweet acoustic guitar at the beginning and it's catchy chorus, to \"Trapped Under Ice\" and it's fast-paced guitars with dramatic lyrics about being trapped. There is a ton of variety in the album, and it's extremely difficult to find any flaws on each song.\n\nOne of my favorites from the album is \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" and \"Fade to Black\". The former starts off with a guitar riff that creates a power atmosphere, but it also brings an unknown feeling that you can't fully understand. Hetfield has one of his strongest vocal performances on this song. His voice is a shout of power, as if he's giving an epic speech. His vocals also match the lyrics of war, and is further executed with the loud bangs of the drums and the long, extreme guitar riffs. Every single second of this song is packed with power and might that empowers the listener on fighting.\n\nThe latter song is a ballad that comes with a ton of emotional moments. It opens up with an acoustic guitar as well as another guitar playing a nice riff. However, it then cuts to the acoustic guitar playing a slow, depressed riff. The instruments are all playing in a slow tempo and create a sad atmosphere. Hetfield then sings about losing all hope. His vocals are more depressed, and fit well to the sad tone. The second part, however, is more upbeat. The acoustic guitar is replaced with a more fast, powerful guitar riff, with the rest of the instruments following suit by having a louder, faster, and more upbeat sound. Hetfield's vocals gain more power in this part as he sing about dying. The overall theme of the song is an interpretation of depression and death and remains one of Metallica's most power songs.\n\nThe overall quality of this album is a masterpiece. If \"Kill 'Em All\" revolutionized their sound, then \"Ride the Lightning\" perfected it. This is the album that truly got Metallica going, and the band would later try to copy it in their future works. It remains a classic album by many today.\n",
        "\nEvery metalhead I know is at least familiar with Metallica, and for good reasons. They're the ones who joined the big four (along with Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax) and popularize the thrash metal genre. One of their albums \"Master of Puppets\" is considered one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. Yet, a lot of the people who praise MOP tend to ignore their debut album \"Kill 'Em All\".\n\nReleased in 1983, this is the album that placed Metallica on the map. It's where Metallica finally got their true style, as their previous demo \"No Life 'til Leather\" is where they experimented a bit with a variety of sounds. While much better thrash metal albums would come out years later, their debut album still holds up today.\n\nEach song has its own style of thrash that makes them memorable. \"Whiplash\" is a fast-paced song with an excellent guitar riff and brutal lyrics about getting attacked by the noise. \"The Four Horsemen\" is another powerful song about war. It has a bit of a power metal feel to it, and the guitar solo in the middle of the song is outstanding, as Kirk shows off his fast, upbeat guitar skills. And of course, there's \"Seek & Destroy\". From the lyrics of murder and destruction, to the rough guitars and banging drums, this song is one of the highlights of the album.\n\nThe vocals to the album are done by the renowned James Hetfield. His vocals are a mix between a shout of might and power, and a shout of rage and anger. The vocals fit perfectly with the aggressive atmosphere. In \"No Remorse\", the song's lyrics about not showing remorse when fighting in war are enhanced with the harsh vocals of Hetfield. His vocals in this album would be the start of his many memorable moments in Metallica's later works.\n\n\"(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth\" is the album's only instrument. The first half of the song is a bass solo from the late Cliff Burton. While it's sad to see Burton pass away early in his career, he had one of his best moments on this album. The song in particular shows off a complex, distorted bass that gives you the feeling that you're being put on anesthesia. It is a psychedelic moment of the album that feels powerful in putting the listener into a trance state. However, the second half of the song is where the rest of the band comes in and starts playing. I find the second half of the song to be a bit generic, as it sounds like something Black Sabbath or Iron Maiden would do.\n\nThe bonus tracks are cover songs from Diamond Head and Blitzkrieg, named \"Am I Evil?\" and \"Blitzkrieg\" respectively. If I had to choose which cover is better, I would go with \"Am I Evil?\". The song is an improved version from Diamond Head's take, as it includes more darker guitar riffs and the vocals of the song bring more power to the lyrics. However, the band didn't do anything new in \"Blitzkrieg\" and sounds more like the original song. \"Blitzkrieg\" is one of the only songs that I would skip through this project.\n\nWhile this album may not be the greatest of all time when compared to their later works, it is certainly not their worst. The album's rough thrash sound would be the base of their later works from their second album \"Ride the Lightning\" all the way up to the commercial success of \"The Black Album\". While their recent projects are a hit or miss, I'd like to go back to this album and bang my head to the good ol' days of one of the greatest metal bands ever.\n",
        "\nProg sure is a strange thing. Some people love it, some people can't stand it, yet no one can give you a concrete answer as to what the hell it actually is. Oh sure, there are specific musical aspects that are commonly accepted as staples of progressive music: complex song structures, virtuosic musicianship, unconventional and interesting arrangements, e.t.c. - but those are just disjointed elements that could just as well be present in any genre of music. Obviously, all of those things can be used and abused in a myriad of different ways, and the results may highly vary - such music can be perceived as either an epic journey into the unknown or a pointless exercise in overindulgence.\n\nAnd now for the reason behind my seemingly pointless babble: this album is the earliest instance of what I can call an awful prog metal album. Metallica's fourth studio album is widely considered to be a borderline progressive metal output that briefly popularized this more sophisticated style among metal fans everywhere. However, it suffers from a lot of things that I do not enjoy about prog metal: long songs with little variety to keep them interesting; needless repetition and interludes with the sole purpose of padding out the songs; heavily downplayed metal elements in favor of something entirely different. All of those things and more would later become the norm for progressive metal (no thanks to a certain other band and album), but that's enough abstraction: time to discuss the music.\n\nStarting with the most glaring aspect: the production. Metallica are not doing their image any good here, as this is some of the worst production I've heard on any famous metal album. It's common knowledge that the bass is completely inaudible (save for most of \"To Live Is To Die\"), but that's just one of many problems present here. The guitar tone is powerless and sterile, which is an unforgivable offense for any metal band, let alone a thrash band. The drums are too damn loud in the mix, particularly the snare drum - and this even compounds another problem that I'll address later. The vocals are actually quite alright as far as production is concerned, but they alone cannot justify the problems with the instruments. Taking into account that this is supposed to be a much more angry and emotional album than their previous efforts (the band was, after all, in turmoil following Cliff's death), the production is a huge negative impact on the purpose of the album, as it makes it much more difficult to get the band's message across.\n\nHowever, the main attraction here are the songs. The thrashing mayhem that was the driving force behind their previous output is mostly absent. Taking its place is something that would later become groove metal: namely, slowed down thrash riffs with only a fraction of the energy present in genuine thrash metal. There are some occasional glimpses of decent midpaced thrash in some parts of \"The Shortest Straw\", \"The Frayed Ends Of Sanity\", and \"Dyers Eve\", but the majority of the content here, while certainly catchy, is boring as hell. \"Harvester Of Sorrow\", while one of the shortest songs here, is one of the most boring, as it rides one single boring groove riff for the majority of its duration.\n\nOn top of this problem are the ones that began rearing their ugly heads on MOP: clean guitar sections that are there to only sugarcoat the songs (\"One\" is particularly disgusting in that regard), and, unsurprisingly, Lars's drumming. If you want a legit reason to hate him, I think I found it: he doesn't keep the beat. At all. Normally, a drummer's job is to keep the rhythm of the song going, so that the other instruments can build off of said rhythm. Lars Ulrich does not give a fuck about such mundane things and just plays whatever he feels like, constantly bashing the snare drum, changing up his drum patterns on the fly and throwing in random fills with no rhyme or reason.\n\nAside from what's mentioned above, another thing to discuss is this album's supposed progressive nature. The songs are longer, sure, but that alone does not merit a \"progressive\" moniker to be added to this release. Many riffs here are actually dumbed down here compared to their previous work, thanks to the slower pace. The songs occasionally show some rhythmic inconsistencies, so as to put a riff into uncommon time with no real benefit. It's not even like they specifically wrote the riffs around uncommon time - here it's usually done by adding or removing a few beats to throw you off. Kirk's solos sound the exact same way as on previous albums - I didn't notice any development. Finally, the songs themselves show every sign of needless padding, with many sections repeated for just that purpose. No development in their structure was made compared to Ride The Lightning. \"To Live Is To Die\" is especially guilty of this, as it follows the exact same formula as \"Orion\" from MOP: a juicy, melodic middle section sandwiched in between a couple of boring riffs that keep droning on and on - before and after said middle section.\n\nThe funny thing is, despite this being the least popular of Metallica's early albums, it still had a large amount of influence on thrash metal. I'm not saying it invented prog thrash - Watchtower deserves all the credit for that. No, this album popularized prog - or rather, the bad aspects of prog. After this album's release, thrash suddenly gained a bigger emphasis on longer songs, more elaborate structures and more \"not thrash\". Some bands executed this quite well and also relied more on substance and emotional impact (Metal Church and Overkill, for example). Others (Heathen and Dark Angel) blindly jumped on that trend without any second thoughts. All of these ended up being far better than this album, but that was because they were still thrash and still relied on blazing riffage to get their point across. The slowed down riffing here also bears a glaring similarity to the likes of Pantera, and the needless padding and interludes later became a staple of prog through Dream Theater (though THOSE trends would still have to wait a few years). MOP had all of that too, sure, but it wasn't until \"Justice\" that those influences really began taking center stage and leaving the energy of metal as an afterthought.\n\nYou might think I'm quite generous with the rating that I've given this album, but that's because I've decided to rate it without taking its massive negative influence into account. Even so, this is still a terrible album, and one of Metallica's worst. It's just a chore to listen to, and I have no desire to do so ever again. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to put on something far better and experience complete satisfaction.\n",
        "\nReleasing an acoustic live album might have been the only thing that was still missing in Metallica's experimental career after a collaboration record with Lou Reed, concerts with symphonic orchestras and cover albums. The concert recorded in the band's hometown of San Francisco was organized for a good cause as all proceeds went to the All Within My Hands foundation. The final result is quite a mixed bag however.\n\nOn the positive side, the set list is quite creative and includes four very different cover songs as well as rarely performed tunes such as the moody ''Bleeding Me'' and a surprisingly smooth, melodic and abridged interpretation of ''All Within My Hands''. The songs performed here have a country and southern rock vibe going back to the style of the band's Load and ReLoad era in the mid-nineties. The quartet was supported by Avi Vinocour on mandolin, Henry Salvia on keyboards, Cody Rhodes on percussion and David Phillips on pedal-steel. The atmosphere of the show is quite intimate and a welcome change from the band's sold-out arena performances.\n\nWhile some tracks such the energetic ''Hardwired'' or the dreamy ''The Unforgiven'' work well in their acoustic reinterpretations, some songs lack energy, focus and grit such as the toothless ''Enter Sandman'' and the oddly chosen experimental opener ''Disposable Heroes''. The concert's flow is interrupted by numerous lengthy announcements, interactions with the crowd and improvised soundchecks. About a sixth of the record's running time is wasted with those overlong breaks that could have been filled with some additional renditions of Metallica classics instead.\n\nIn the end, Helping Hands... Live & Acoustic at the Masonic is a welcome release for faithful Metallica fans and should particularly please to those who liked the band's experimental southern rock era in the mid-nineties that gets an unexpected comeback here. However, the record's flow is its most important downside and a studio recording of these acoustic versions would have been a more appropriate option. As a matter of fact, an acoustic record with Metallica classics, cover tunes and perhaps a handful of new tracks would be a welcome release for old and new fans. As it is now, this release doesn't exploit its entire potential and remains an odd side note in the band's massive discography. At least, the charismatic quartet is still willing to experiment thirty-seven years into its career instead of keeping things safe.\n",
        "\nEvery single metalhead I've ever met has Master of Puppets in their top 10 albums of all time, I'm sure of that. It seems like if everyone loved this album, and I can't disagree enough with these people. I'll put it simply: in my opinion, Master of Puppets is the most overrated thrash metal album to ever be released, it's nowhere as good as everyone portraits it, at least to my ears. Let me explain:\n\nI bought this album back in 2016 perhaps, it was one of the first CDs I've ever owned and I have it next to me as I'm writing this review. I've already known this album previously, Metallica was pretty much the first metal band I've ever listened to and Master of Puppetsi was the song I'd always listen to. Back when I was like 10 years old I'd think Metallica was a badass band and that this album was the best thing to ever exist, but years passed, I've developed new and better tastes in music, I've got a lot of hair all around my body and I've reached the realization that this album isn't the greatest of all time, by a long shot. I might be somewhat biased due to my crippling addiction to progressive and/or melodic death metal or hardcore, and somebody reading this will definitely be thinking that I'm a stupid kid who doesn't know what good music is... Well, I might not know what good music is, but this album in my opinion is not that.\n\nEnough with backstories, bashing the album and repeating the same things again and again, in order to get this review accepted I gotta explain the music, and that's what I'm going to do:\n\nFirst of all, the guitar riffs; everybody loves a good riff, thrash metal has great riffs, and even this album as some good riffs in it, but not all the time. If I'm going to be honest, Master of Puppet's main riff is really cool and it never gets old, and Disposable Heroes as some good riffs here and there, but frankly, that's all I've enjoyed from this album; some songs are extremely boring and have terrible riffs and melodies. The Thing That Should Not Be has one of the most boring riffs to ever be made by this band, it's truly disgusting how the album goes from a song like Master of Puppets to this, a boring, repetitive song with a lack of interesting melodies or riffs, it's feels like switching from a Ferrari to a Fiat 206 (not that a Fiat 206 is a bad car, but you get the idea).\n\nTo one of the most boring songs from this band follows another song which somehow manages to be even more boring: Welcome Home (Sanitarium). Since \"Ride the Lightning\", Metallica decided that every album should include a sort of power ballad or a slow melodic song, and this is the one in this album. The arpeggio and solo at the start are nice to hear, but after that it just goes downhill, the song lacks of truly good riffing or melodies, maybe this song is not THAT bad on its own, but having to listen to this 6:30 minutes boring song after another 6:30 minutes boring song just fucking annoys me, and the fast part of the song which is supposed to unleash hell with a good riff is just a bunch open palm-muted E notes. What a way to ruin a potentially great part of the song.\n\nBoth the first time I heard this release and now, I can hardly bring myself to keep listening after the 4th track because I'm bored as hell at this point; I could barely headbang to the previous songs, but thankfully the album doesn't go downhill too much after this. I enjoyed Disposable Heroes and I believe it's the best song from this album, while the rest of the songs from that point are a big \"meh\" for me. Leper Messiah it's just another boring mid-tempo song while Damage, Inc. is somewhat a good song except that the flow of the song is ruined by the sudden stops and the whispered \"damage incorporated\", but I don't think it's as bad as some of the other songs.\n\nOverall, the guitar work in this album is a mixed pile of crap and good stuff, but with crap being around 70% of the bag. Most songs go from great riffs to generic-sounding, shitty riffs and 0-0-0-0-0, kinda like Slayer but without the speed or aggressiveness.\n\nThe rest of the instruments are there. It's worth noting (even though we all know it) that this was Cliff Burton's last album before his unfortunate death. I don't Cliff was that good of a bassist as everyone remembers him; I believe he's overrated due to his tragic death, and because people don't dare speaking badly of a dead person most of the time. He wasn't the best bassist metal or thrash ever had, not even close, but he was definitely the best bassist Metallica ever had, and I do think he was some steps ahead of the average bassists at that time, but nowhere near that \"godlike\" status many people adjudicated to his playing. The bass work in this album is quite depressing, I can barely hear Cliff in the any of the songs except for Orion, and the most amazing thing he plays in this song is that sweet bass solo, nothing else worth mentioning at all, but everything he plays in this song is far more interesting than what he does the rest of the album; in all the other songs, I heard a null use of the bass as anything else than a guitar tuned an octave down; if anybody has read my previous reviews, you know how much I like and appreciate a good use of the 4 (or 5) strings in a song; some bassists do have talent, but it goes to waste because they play the most underrated instrument in all of metal music (in my opinion), and this album (and Metallica overall) isn't an exception to this. Cliff's last work isn't as impressive as it could, and as it should have been, and just a single song with a bass solo doesn't make him justice.\n\nThe drums... yeah.. they are there... Lars was never a great drummer and definitely not a creative one, this album has the average drum beats for thrash metal; not many interesting stuff to say about the drums, and that's not a good thing at all, there are no great fills, no interesting beats, nothing worth mentioning from the drums apart from them being average, or even below-average. I even get to think that many of the songs are mid-tempo because Lars couldn't play too fast and well as, for an example, Dave Lombardo could.\n\nLastly, the thing that completes the puzzle; the vocals. I've never seen James Hetfield as a great vocalist. I mean, he's not bad, but he isn't good either; his raspy voice doesn't sound too harsh or \"brutal\", and his clean voice isn't too amazing, and he always lacks of melody for the softer part of some songs; most of the time he's just shouting the lyrics (it's thrash anyway), but when he has to go soft he just sounds lame and his voice lacks of any emotion or harmony. Still, his vocal style is far better than those of some other thrash metal vocalists I've heard and it's pretty much a classic, so it's somewhat hard to criticize it, but something that it's not hard to criticize are his lyrics; they are terrible:\nMost of the songs sound like random rhyming words being throw together at random, like this extract from Battery:\n\n\"Thrashing all deceivers, mashing non-believers,\nNever ending potency.\nHungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker,\nBreeding on insanity.\"\n\nI can't find any real meaning to this other than it might be talking about moshing, which is still unlikely. It just sounds like if Hetfield was looking to make cool and badass lyrics so he just put some words referring to violence together with words that sound \"cool\" or something. While songs like Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Disposable Heroes or Damage, Inc. make some sense, the rest of the songs have terrible lyrics, and it's obvious as fuck that nobody had any ideas for good lyrics when you come up with this verse from Master of Puppets:\n\n\"Hell is worth all that, natural habitat,\nJust a rhyme without a reason.\nNever-ending maze, drift on numbered days,\nNow your life is out of season.\"\n\n\"Just a rhyme without a reason\", that sentence explains almost all the lyrics in this album. It amazes me that Hetfield (supposing he wrote these lyrics) was so clueless as what to write that he just decided to write about how clueless he is as what to write, do you understand? I feel like this just takes away all the seriousness from this song and every meaning to the lyrics of it, it ruins everything for me, and I always cringe when I hear this line. I could keep writing example of meaningless lyrics but I would have to transcribe all the lyrics of the damn album almost.\n\nI'm pretty sure I've said everything I had to say about this album. It's not as good as everyone thinks it is, it's not the best album by Metallica. From this point onwards this band went downhill; this release was a huge downgrade from what \"Ride the Lightning\" was, and apart from just some riffs and maybe one or two songs, I can't find anything great in this album. It's overrated, it's bad, it lacks of almost all things that make albums good in my ears, and it's one of the few thrash metal albums that can't bring me to headbang; I guess this says it all.\n",
        "\nFound my copy of this recently and it triggered a huge hit of nostalgia. Finding the vinyl in a random Icelandic flea market 10 years ago and taking it back to the hotel with a level of care normally reserved for premature babies. There's that very, very typical metal origins story of having my head blown off by disc 2 of Garage Inc. when I was 11 or thereabouts as well; it's such a huge cliche but songs like Helpless, Breadfan and the at-that-time shockingly RUDE So What probably had a bigger influence in who I grew up to be than almost anything else in life.\n\nI thought these songs were originals for years. All I had was a rando unmarked tape recording of it, and I guess it goes to show just how good Metallica were at making these songs their own. I'm not convinced there's that much point comparing these tunes to the originals, they sound all over the shop, this sounds like Metallica. If I'm going to be picky, it sounds like Justice era Metallica rerecording some Kill Em All era material. It still thrashes, but that hard rock influence that they so ruthlessly excised from Lightning onwards is back. Everything is a bit less chromatic. It's fun tunes jammed out with the boys over a few cold ones, as opposed to the (rather strange when you think about it) image of a small Danish dude and a large surfer lookin dude from SoCal sitting down and carefully composing individual drum hits and downstrokes until everything was just so.\n\nPutting it on - like most people on this site I could very easily do this review without having to hear the album ever again- the first thing I'm reminded of is that the production is really, really fun. The tones are great. There's a huge amount of energy, the drums, crisp and with a decent crack to them, the rhythm guitars loud, crunchy and thick, kinda a perfect halfway between the AJFA and Black album tone, the bass nicely throaty and really loud. If we're going to be a little bit picky, the only thing really stopping this album from being a production showcase is a bit of inconsistency with the vocals, sometimes a bit distant, and the lead tones changing from big and full in Helpless to strangely nasal and quiet in The Wait and Crash Course. I've always wondered why this sound wasn't the template for Justice, because it sounds really really really good.\n\nIt's rather odd hearing these guys having such a good time, as the first five full lengths were fairly well marked by stony faced seriousness. There's nothing like Last Caress anywhere else in their discog! James in particular sounds drunk off his ass and having a great time with the vocals- nearing that four or so year run where he was undeniably at his vocal prime, and Lars is clearly enjoying beating the shit out of his kit, Jason's noodling everywhere, so on and so forth. I guess what you're hearing here is a band that is.. well, not the most technical band in the universe or anything, but a band that is at the peak of their game and is extremely well oiled. There aren't many raw, \"just for fun\" cover EPs where the rhythm guitars are as tight, that's for sure. \n\nAll up, I'm reminded that if I had a time machine, killing Hitler as a baby would be my second choice. The first choice for temporal destination would be seeing Metallica live somewhere between this release and 1989 or thereabouts.\n\nHow to rate it? I got no idea, it's not really a classic, but it is probably my second most listened to album of all time and I'm still not sick of it. In the spirit of the album, imma not overthink it and give it a high mark. You've likely already heard this, but if for some reason you haven't, it's absolutely worth your time.\n",
        "\nWhen listening to this album for the first time, the feeling of reminiscences arises periodically and quite often: this is not about that Metallica quote verbatim their own early albums, however, some riffs on \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\" definitely remind of the riffs from their early \"hits\". I do not have the heart to call it \"self-plagiarism\", although if someone has leveled such a charge against band (which, most likely, was the case), then I have nothing to say to the contrary. During subsequent listenings to this album, the deja vu sensation did not disappear, on the contrary, it became stronger. \n\nFor example, in the very first song \"Hardwired\" the chords from \"... and Justice for All\" and even \"Kill 'Em All\" are recognized, in the second \"Atlas, Rise!\" riffs from the debut album are heard more distinctly, you can even call the concrete song: \"Whiplash\". I suspect Metallica's desire to repeat / overcome / reconsider or whatever their evergreen \"hit\" \"One\" in the beginning of the sixth \"Halo on Fire\", as well as, by the way, in \"Here Comes Revenge\", the third song on the second disc. It should be further noted the last song on the album \"Spit Out the Bone\" \u2013 this is the most dynamic song on the second disc, \u2013 is consonant with \"Dyers Eve\" and in some way fulfills its role: closes the album on a bravura note. So, these are only the most striking examples. \n\nThe genres that are antithetical to my orthodox heart of black metaller (well...), are harder to recognize on this album, but it seemed that I spotted nu metal in the third \"Now That We're Dead\" and in the already mentioned \"Here Comes Revenge\". In the fourth \"Am I Savage?\" groove metal elements are presented (I can't help but notice, this is definitely the most unsuccessful composition on the second disc). It is possible that all this is also Metallica, it's just beyond my knowledge: I belong to the circle of their esteemers who, for obvious reasons, don't really like their albums \"Load\", \"ReLoad\" and \"St. Anger\". I also distance myself from \"Death Magnetic\", but maybe this is overkill. While we are at it, I really love \"Lulu\", but that's a different story. \n\nOne way or another, that's what I'm driving at: \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\" is not an experimental album from the category listed above. This is some kind of retrospective album, and Metallica particularly did not try to hide it. From the other side, this work can be called \"old material in a new package\": it submits almost classic thrash metal (and heavy metal of course), modernized in such event, that is, mixed with other genres, recorded with modern sound, processed using modern technologies and so on. This is \"Kill 'Em All\" \u2013 \"...and Justice for All\" of XXI century. And this album excludes any \"revolution\" in the world of metal music, no innovations this time. \n\nI can not ignore the \"reverse side of the coin.\" Well, most likely, \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\" is a commercial move. Metallica are good managers, they'd thought this album out properly: it would be possible with the help of this work to attract into the army of their fans followers of the new generation, as well as to revive the interest of the old ones. Well, it worked \u2013 at least as applied to me. I really like \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\", I listen to it quite often. Definitely it's not \"Load\" or \"ReLoad\" or \"St. Anger\" or... Ok then. \n\nThe strongest and most interesting side of this album is the choruses of songs, very melodic and often even penetrating. Yes, we are talking about metal music, not about pop music, but as I made it clear earlier, this album was designed for the masses, therefore it also tames pop music techniques. Nevertheless, the \"good old\" Metallica is recognized in choruses often, in particular, \"Atlas, Rise!\" \u2013 here is the refrain in the vein of \"Master of Puppets\". Sometimes only refrain saves song, as, for example, in the case of the third song \"Now That We're Dead\" \u2013 by the way, the most unfortunate song on the first disc, it only \"hooks\" with that it presses for a very long time, \"hammers away at the same point.\" The bridges on \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\" are also mostly gorgeous. Not but that I found this fragment as the best one, but I'll note the impressive bridge in the fifth song \"Dream No More\" \u2013 its effect is further enhanced by the fact that the song itself is rather gloomy, which is quite surprising for this album. \n\nTheoretically, it would be possible to put all 12 songs of the album on one CD (and bootleggers do just that), but it seems to be a very good decision to split material into two discs \u2013 so you'll be not tired of long listening and it allows you to duly appreciate all the stuff. Well, the first disc is undoubtedly better than the second one, to take at least the fact that it contains the main \"hits\" of the album: the second \"Atlas, Rise!\" and the fourth \"Moth into Flame\". But the second disc, perhaps, requires a more thorough reflection. Right, if the first disc is \"pop music\", then the second is... hmm, \"intelligent dance music\"? Be that as it may, I do not recommend listening to both discs in a row \u2013 the second should be listened to in isolation from the first. \n\nI have not yet come close to a final understanding of the second half, but I suspect it's more grunge than metal. Grunge has firmly infiltrated into metal here and customized it for itself. The most obvious example is \"the very\" second song \"ManUNkind\": the material of \"Kill 'Em All\" is somehow mixed with grunge here, but the latter dominates. I definitely don't like this song, although the introduction (thank you, Robert) and especially the chorus are good, \u2013 but it's grunge. \n\nRegarding the video clip for this song, featuring footage from the movie \"Lords of Chaos\", because of which almost all orthodox black metallers erupted with righteous indignation. It was the proverbial \"artistic provocation\" and nothing more I think. Well, it worked. Metallica got it: even those who tried to ignore them started talking about them (I mean orthodox black metallers). I will not hide, the video amazed me, but didn't outrage me at all. It could be even said it amused me. (Just in case: I did not watch \"Lords of Chaos\".) \n\nIf the best song on the second disc is \"Here Comes Revenge\", then the fifth \"Murder One\" seems to me the most interesting. That's exactly how I feel. \"Murder One\" is some kind of thoughtful composition, here you can also hear \"Master of Puppets\" and \"... and Justice for All\", but in general there is more modernity here than \"the breath of antiquity\". But again, maybe this is the very same Metallica, which I don't know well enough to discuss. I can also say that I cannot get past the idea that the last song \"Spit Out the Bone\" begins the same way as the first \"Confusion\" \u2013 an alarming beat in a sort of military march manner, such a technique was / is very popular among old school metal bands. Although the main body of the one and the other composition sounds something modern. \n\nCertain something presents in the second disc, but what, I can't say. As far as I know, the albums \"Load\" and \"ReLoad\" were originally supposed to be released as one double album, that is, it is the same material, although \"ReLoad\" is considered more experimental and diverse compared to \"Load\". Maybe the same thing happened here, and we are dealing with two albums. For example, \"Hardwired\" and \"Self-Destruct\". Maybe, of course, I have \"multiplied entities without necessity\", and Metallica just wanted to earn more money on a double release, and they covered up this matter with some intrigue. Well, it worked.\n",
        "\nMusic videos have recently been going out of vogue and have traditionally been underused by metal bands and particularly by the genre's most popular groups. Metallica is overall a positive exception and this collection is actually quite entertaining with a running time way above two hours.\n\nThe band's first music video might also be its most popular one. It offers scenes from the gripping anti-war movie Johnny Got His Gun intertwined with the young band performing in an abandoned warehouse. The shots in black and vibe add a visual atmosphere to the already emotional epic ''One''. \n\nThe band continued to experiment with the music video genre with its epic ballad ''The Unforgiven'' that is also featured in its theatrical version of eleven and a half minutes on this release. The cryptic short movie in black and white shows a young boy who becomes and adult and later on an old man who desperately tries to carve an opening into a stone wall all his life.\n\nAnother intriguing music video was made for the moody ''Until It Sleeps'' that shows the band members wearing heavy make-up and struggling with inner demons in a visually stunning way. Just like the song itself, the music video is an acquired taste but it certainly is very unique.\n\nThe same could be said about the music video for ''The Memory Remains'' where the band plays in a revolving room while guest singer Marianne Faithfull makes an appearance as enigmatic host of said room.\n\nThe music video for the Bob Seger cover ''Turn the Page'' is maybe the most intense one on this compilation. It shows the everyday life of a prostitute who lives in cheap hotel rooms and dances in filthy strip clubs while her young daughter follows her everywhere. In a few intersected interview clips, the prostitute claims she would make the same life choices again but her voice is cracking and she is looking down which implies that she is lying to herself. At the end of the clip, the prostitute gets sexually abused by one of her clients while her daughter watches in a closet and comforts her saddened mother after the event. This music video offers a lot of food for thought and leaves the spectator on an uneasy note.\n\nA final interesting music video is the one made for single ''I Disappear'' that was made for the soundtrack of Mission: Impossible 2. It shows the band playing on a rock formation in Arizona which is the opening location of said movie. The performance is intertwined with scenes where the different members must escape dangerous situations such as getting out of a crumbling building or facing an angry crowd leading to a claustrophobic experience.\n\nThe quality of Metallica's music videos is overall excellent despite a few boring clips that only show the band performing on stage or in studio. Fans of the band and those who value the underrated art of music videos should purchase this release alike. Since the band continued to make numerous music videos in recent years, here's hope that this release will have its sequel in a few years. I would certainly purchase that one as well. If you look for another band that highly valued the art of music videos, check out Red Hot Chili Peppers' Greatest Videos.\n",
        "\nMetallica was my door into metal, as for many others. This is a band that has a special place in my heart and always will, no matter what. But, as any relationship sometimes reaches a point where you start to question if you are in it just for comfort, I started to analyze my relation to Metallica.\n\nAs a die-hard fan, I have been somewhat religiously accepting anything produced, finding good sides to all albums. For example, I think that Load and Reload are great hard&heavy albums with some interesting features within them, funny experiments that were children of their times. The notorious St. Anger is indeed a failure but it\u2019s a catharsis, influenced by the circumstances around it. At first, I didn\u2019t care much for Death Magnetic, but I have revalued it lately, so that\u2019s why I was very anxious about the release of Hardwired\u2026to Self-Destruct: would it be another step forward towards a more mature and defined sound of modern Metallica, or will it be another slip towards being just average good, a product parasitizing the band\u2019s massive iconic status, its huge fan base and earlier masterpieces?\n\nAt first, I was quite disappointed by this release, which felt as uninspired as I feared. After some listenings, I must say that there are several good qualities in it, and some really great basis, which unfortunately are ruined by some major flaws which, by the end of the day, makes this album just average-good, yet still disappointing if you think of a Metallica product. Even if the album continues the \u201creturn to trash\u201d-mission started with Death Magnetic, it does not manage to fulfil this mission in a satisfying manner: you get trashy sounds, trashy riffs, but you lose it all along the journey.\n\nTracks in HTSD are decent, some quite good and some really not, but nothing remarkable. The setting in two separate CDs are baffling, you could easily put them all into one single album. The real problem is the excessive length of many songs, which easily could be shortened to 4 minutes\u2019 pieces. I am especially thinking of \u201cSpit out the Bone\u201d, 7 minutes long with at least two intersections that \u2013 however cool and well performed \u2013 could be avoided without taking away anything from the track. \n\nAnyway, you start with good intentions, with \u201cHardwired\u201d, \u201cAtlas, Rise!\u201d, \u201cMoth into the Flames\u201d which have all strong trash metal riffs and an excellent guitar work (James Hetfield delivers fantastically in this album) but fail to keep this strength as they weaken in the choruses and lose themselves in mid-tempos, intersections and rhythmic changes that breaks the flow. Kind of frustrating, but this will endure so\u2026better accept this before listening to HTSD. \n\nThe first disc is perhaps slightly heavier than the second. The second presents maybe the weakest tracks: \u201cAm I Savage?\u201d \u201cManUNkind\u201d and \u201cMurder One\u201d. The first two have nothing to say, feeling uninspired and superfluous (especially \u201cAm I Savage?\u201d) the third one is plain honestly bad: \u201cMurder One\u201d is dedicated to the memory of Lemmy (R.I.P.), and even though the lyrics are (kind of) related to him, this track could have be so much better realized than how it turned out to be. Metallica owe so much to Lemmy and Mot\u00f6rhead, which is one of their main sources of inspiration and throughout the years they have performed so many great covers of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s songs. Personally I would have opted \u2013 and kind of expected \u2013 a tribute track to Lemmy in a speedy, fast pace just as he would have loved it. A little harsh, a little bluesy, something to remember him by. Instead, you find yourself with some sort of stoner/heavy rock anthem that doesn\u2019t say anything, at least not about Lemmy. Lyrics are frankly kind of cheesy and the song itself is below average, which is even more upsetting considering that Metallica has (had?) such amazing skills in writing emotion-capturing music. Taking into account that this track is dedicated to a legend, it should have been much better (although the official video kicks ass, luckily!).\n\nSpeaking of lyrics, they are below Metallica\u2019s standards, as they were in Death Magnetic and St. Anger. Take just the example of the chorus in \u201cHardwired\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re so fucked, shit outta luck [\u2026]\u201d: an angry teenager shouting his rage in total frustration, but it\u2019s not the ground-breaking teen of the 80\u2019s shouting against society, no; now it\u2019s more of a disillusioned \u201cmillennial\u201d crying out for attention trying to act cool. Something that, done by 50+ millionaires, it's not cool, just sad.\n\nOn a technical level, we have James\u2019 vocals which are really good but sounds kind of fake, as he was putting too much effort in sounding harsh and angry with some honeyed clean executions in between which has been his signature trait for the last decades. His work on guitar is excellent as already said before: great riffs and powerful execution. Kirk Hammett\u2019s lead guitar is technically good as always, with decent solos and his brand wah-wahs, but his presence is more or less superfluous, like a digital addition to the main rock-solid guitar sound by Hetfield. Rob Trujillo\u2019s bass is missing, which is quite a pity as he is an amazing musician risking to fall in the bass anonymity that haunts the band following that tragic moment in 1986. However there are a good bass-line in \u201cHalo on Fire\u201d and a great solo in \u201cSpit Out the Bone\u201d. Drums are better than on Death Magnetic but still sounding bad. \n\nNot being really bad, HTSD is more like unimpressive. There are some really good elements, glimpses of lights. You feel the inspiration and connection to most of Metallica\u2019s past works, and maybe a good way to sum-up this album is by defining it as a blend of Death Magnetic and Reload, with some pinches from \u201cthe Black Album\u201d and ...And Justice for All. HTSD would have been an excellent possibility for Metallica to evolve further into their music, after having experienced the experimental adventure of the mid \u201890s and the turbulent 2000s. This is an issue that I think haunts most of the great bands after a while: it is impossible to stay on the top forever, you are bound to some downs as well. The sad thing is, maybe they are tired, which is justified as they have achieved already everything a band can achieve, perhaps they have nothing more to prove.\n\nTo sum up, HTSD is a decent release, with some high peaks that makes it one of the most interesting records produced by Metallica in the last 15 years. However, many flaws within the tracks and a general sense of sloppiness make this a rather unimpressive record with so much potential gone wasted. Good by regular standards, medium-low quality for Metallica.\n",
        "\nThere are a few albums \u2013 specifically debut albums \u2013 that work much better because of their simplicity. I\u2019ve written something similar about Iron Maiden\u2019s debut and I feel that Kill \u2018Em All fits the mould too. Style, songs, cover art \u2013 none of it complicates the basic enjoyment of pure heavy metal. And, yes, I would classify Metallica\u2019s debut as something closer to pure heavy metal than actual thrash metal as we know it today, because this (as the almost indisputable First Thrash Album) was a blank slate that described a kind of thrash metal without rules and restrictions. I like it all the more for that.\n\nI\u2019ve always felt that the \u201880s wave of thrash metal became too specific too quickly and focused its attention rather too narrowly to interest me for a full album from many of the major bands. Sure, someone needed to drag heavy metal into faster, more technical, and more exciting waters, but they didn\u2019t need to do it in such a formulaic fashion, with seemingly every other album opening with acoustic guitars then blasting into 8 five minute songs all featuring a similar kind of riffing. A caricature, I know. By acting as one of the stepping stones to that kind of thrash environment, Kill \u2018Em All only does that for a few songs and focuses on better songwriting and more traditional heavy metal catchiness for the rest of the time. Sceptics testify: is \u2018Seek & Destroy\u2019 thrash? Unequivocally not in either speed or technique. Could we rope songs like \u2018Jump in the Fire\u2019 and \u2018The Four Horseman\u2019 into that statement? I think so, and the reason is that they possess much stronger dynamics than most thrash songs you\u2019d care to name.\n\nTo break down the style, we can hear the same sort of punkiness that Iron Maiden possessed in their early days, James Hetfield\u2019s scratchy yowl doing similar things to Paul Di\u2019Anno and Lars Ulrich favouring sped-up treatment of traditional snare and kick patterns that had really underpinned most rock music since The Beatles. Even one of the album\u2019s faster songs, \u2018Motorbreath\u2019, sees Ulrich tapping the ride cymbal during the guitar solos, which sounds almost tentative for such a supposedly wild style, though admittedly the recording is showing its age now. Personally, I\u2019ve always found \u2018Jump in the Fire\u2019 to be the most rock-sounding song, the main riffs all made up of chords played with a catchy stop-start feel and very simple four-on-the-floor drumming to back them, while the guitar leads Kirk Hammett plays are a fluid, energetic version of \u201870s rock soloing that stylistically sits between old school rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and the shred that was starting to develop. If you can\u2019t hear the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll influence, have a listen to the first solo of \u2018Hit the Lights\u2019 and then grab hold of some Fats Domino or Chuck Berry, bearing in mind the time gap and added aggression. Technical this is not.\n\nAs I said though, that\u2019s why I like Kill \u2018Em All. Parts of it sound like a jam band getting really into it, which is why Cliff Burton\u2019s bass solo \u2018Anesthesia\u2019 fits in so well (plus the fact that it\u2019s extremely listenable as a song, especially after the beat comes in). Metallica were obviously pretty hyped when writing and playing the material, so hearing them trying to go faster is similarly exciting for the listener, such as when those sawing rhythm guitar riffs in \u2018Whiplash\u2019 and \u2018Metal Militia\u2019 just keep going again and again in a kind of frenzied groove. Crucially, the band change up the technique, dropping into the slower, hooky bridge section of \u2018Whiplash\u2019 before the fast solo or deploying the hard rock chorus of \u2018Hit the Lights\u2019, thus making sure that the fast parts remain fun. While we\u2019re on the subject of riffs leading the songs, was this really the moment when metal stopped being a subset of vocal- and melody-driven rock music and became all about riffs? It seems about right to me.\n\nJust because the style is fun and catchy doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m totally in favour of all the songs here. Some of them are admittedly more fun than good, such as \u2018Seek & Destroy\u2019, which is overstretched. The progression during the song is diverting and the riffset iconic (plus especially useful for beginners on guitar), but could easily have been trimmed down, just like the strong yet repetitive \u2018No Remorse\u2019 and frankly pretty dull \u2018Phantom Lord\u2019. A couple more the same length as \u2018Motorbreath\u2019 wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss, nor would an overall decrease in time spent on guitar solos; Hammett\u2019s lead style fits better with the more traditional metal here than it would on later albums, though he doesn\u2019t have anything special to offer. Notably, Burton doesn\u2019t take up a great deal of attention on bass, even if the combined punch of the string instruments is the best feature of the overall sound, hence the focus on riffs. As a result, I\u2019m not hit as hard by everything as I should be, while the songs with greater variety in pace and mood stick more easily in my mind.\n\nVery influential albums like this are particularly hard to judge, because the tendency is to overstate their merits in light of their legacy or to criticize the creativity despite its significance as a stepping stone to new styles. On its own merits, therefore, Kill \u2018Em All can most suitably be called a decent synthesis of catchy heavy metal with more aggressive thrash components, in which regard the songwriting of tunes like \u2018The Four Horsemen\u2019 and \u2018No Remorse\u2019 benefits. In my own estimation, this is easily the most fun \u2013 if slightly limited \u2013 recording Metallica ever put to tape.\n",
        "\nWell, this is the first Metallica release I have ever listened to, fully. And yeah, I did that on purpose. But do I really care? No, it's worth bashing this pile of garbage. Seriously, this is the stuff you would hear a new band perform for the first time. You know, Metallica easily crippled their career doing this shit. Hell, because of the unsuccessful results that this bucket of expired semen has brought to the dinner plate, I can easily see why nobody cares enough to \"respect\" Metallica anymore. Hell, even their \"prime\" releases, are overshadowed so, so-heavily because of this. Like, not even the best works can fix this mess. \n\nIt's funny when you think about it, probably the most \"popular\" thrash metal giant, are Metallica, and well, they release something so terrible, and give their genre a bad name. And hell, these guys, even consider themselves \"beliebers\"... Don't believe me, just Google it...and trust me, you'll likely lose even more respect that you might have had before...which was pretty much nothing after \"Lulu\" (2011) was released. However, I can't remember what year they mentioned that, but again, just look it up 'n' you'll see! \n\nAlright, I'll dive into this release's actuality now... So, basically, let's start with the audio's clarity, for this being a 2011 release, the clarity of the production is pretty good. But that doesn't even come close to giving this less than what it deserves, which is a zero-percent from me. Why would Metallica go to such lengths to make bad music? They've honestly become so, so \"mainstream\", that they don't even see themselves as becoming a viral joke...it's practically saddening. The guitar riffs honestly sound like they're being played by someone who's literally just a beginner. The riffs are sloppy, notes don't play and/or mix well at all. Almost every song has the same style of guitar riffs, really bland...as if someone's trying to masturbate on this guitar strings and the drippings are getting stuck on their fingers...something like that. The guitars are even going to such lengths to create a chaotic-like noise in the background that sounds like...\"clean\" noisecore. \n\nBecause of the literal nonsense of the guitars, you can't even hear the bass at all. And hell, the first seventeen minutes, in all-seriousness, you'll likely wind-up with a damn \"headache\"...that's really how it felt 'n' feels for me. A lot of senseless \"riffs\". And the drums don't provide anything special...not even anything \"standard\". The drumming is all the same shit, snare is hit constantly, almost no bass-kicks or symbol-smashing. And back to the guitars again, the damn riffs are so, so...heavily-prolonged...why...WHY?! The lyrics are even lamer than that of a kid from Detroit who can't read 'n' write. The singing sounds like someone who has a damn can-opener stuck in his throat...really loose, thin and stringy...spaghetti vocals, or even vocal noodles, I call them. \n\nThe level of creativity for this album's authentic-like values, would be classified as \"zero\". I swear, ideas, whether they were good-or-not, were recorded and placed onto this album's release, regardless. If this was a team effort, it surely didn't play-out well. The only reason this album made money, was because the names of the individuals of this record were \"big\" or...\"well-known\". That's how it goes for a lot of these \"sell-out\" groups/artists. They take many years to build up a reputation, once they made enough money and their name becomes really, really well-known, they'll make anything, simply because people have been generated through a fan-base 'n' will buy anything from them...it's pathetic and sad...so, so sad... And it's totally taking advantage of the fans who got them where they are today. No respect for the fans...and no self-respect for these reject-artists. \n\nAnd it's albums like these, is why I have trouble even wanting to listen to Metallica's \"prime\" albums... Even if others think those are \"good\"...it's how Metallica shaped themselves today. The lifeblood of their \"drive\" has totally been destroyed. They might as well just stop being a band and live off of the money the fans gave them over the years, just like the thieving assholes they really have become... \"Lulu\" (2011), isn't for anyone at-all...not even for longtime fans of Metallica. If you're someone who likes to buy useless shit, just to find a creative way of ruining it, then a good idea would be is to sharpen the disc and throw it like a damn frisbee and hope you'll chop a tree in half with it. \n\nThe artwork is really lame, too... See, even the mannequin looks really sad. It knew this album was a mistake...or a disgrace. The metal scene will always have to carry the weight of this poorly-crafted piece of...trash. The album cover has a very depressive appearance, it just reminds me of an emo-reject who ran out of razor blades. If you really are a thick-head person and won't take the kind advice of people's reviews about this album, then go ahead and waste about an hour of your life learning the hard way... It's people like me, who know what he's getting himself into, just to save you the time of killing yourself at the end of the day. \n\nAs my title-review says...\n\n\"Lu-Lu-Lu-Lu-L-L-L-Lu-Lu! Fuck you!\"\n",
        "\nHere we have probably the most controversial album in metal history. Before explaining my thoughts on it, let me start with going through the usual concepts and opinions on it. It is loved among a wide audience because for many metalheads this was the first metal album they ever listened to and gives a nostalgia feeling, and is their best-selling album having their two most popular songs according to YouTube views. However, it is also one of the most hated albums in metal for changing their sound from complex thrash metal with progressive tendencies to commercial radio rock.\n\nThis is where the usual misconceptions about the record start. First of all, this album is not that big of a change. Just compare \u201cHarvester of Sorrow\u201d to \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d. I don\u2019t treat \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d as a semi-progressive album: the song lengths are the only thing about it that is reminiscent of prog. The lengthiness is achieved by unnecessary repetition, not by progressing and having multiple ideas. I would also add that the black album is not the point where they \u201cabandoned\u201d thrash metal. \u201cDyers Eve\u201d and \u201cBlackened\u201d are probably the only thrash songs on \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d (2/9), while more songs are slower even than most hard rock. The only novelty the self-titled release brings is shorter songs and audible bass.\n\nNow move to the record itself. First let\u2019s highlight the positives. The more I listen to it, the less songs I like. Without doubt the two ballads are the best songs around here. \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d is my second favourite slow song by the band (after \u201cWelcome Home\u201d), it breaks the conventional calm verse-aggressive chorus pattern of metal ballads. \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d, no matter how stale it gets after overplay, is still a rare example of a power ballad that isn\u2019t emotional in a soap opera-ish way. The only other part that breaks the sameness of the album is the bass solo and some vocals parts in the verses in \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d.\n\nBefore talking about the problems, let me explain that this record is not the ideal starter for potential metalheads as a lot of people make it out to be and neither is the \u201cmainstream betrayal of metal\u201d some others believe it is. There is nothing \u201cpoppy\u201d here (unless you count everything without slams poppy), apart from the three most popular songs. There are no hummable melodic vocal lines that get stuck in your head, or anthemic arena choruses. An example of a mainstream-sounding, accessible album by a thrash band would be \u201cDrift\u201d by Flotsam and Jetsam. Here, I have the feeling that Metallica tried to write mainstream-like songs without knowing what mainstream music is like. The structures and the lack of speed doesn\u2019t make the riffs or melodies leave the metal genre.\n\nThe main reason for my distaste on this album is the monotony. It\u2019s musically the possible least diverse and variable in every possible aspect (apart from the two ballads). Most songs (apart from forgettable intros) have ONE riff. \u201cSad but True\u201d and \u201cThe God that Failed\u201d are prime examples. What\u2019s more, that one riff is everywhere in those songs from beginning to end, even under the solo and the vocals. But the musical sameness does not end here. There are no changes in speed not only within one song, but hardly any on the whole record. The two aforementioned one-riff songs have the exact same tempo. There are no changes in the volume and the length of notes either. Every syllable is sung in the same way, every note on the guitar has the same tone and feel, and the same drum beat is going all long. All these features together bring the music into the state of not going anywhere, just statically standing at the same point.\n\n\u201cSad but True\u201d deserves a separate sentence for how much it represents the malformities described in the last paragraph. I consider it an absolute disgrace to the whole metal genre. It has no atmosphere, no emotion (anger counts as an emotion as well), and most importantly, it has less variation than 5 minutes of silence. Every lyric line seems to be sung within a quint that makes speaking appear as melodic in comparison. The same two drum beats are loyally going through the whole song with a few second-long breaks where you are brought in the false illusion that it\u2019s finally over. I checked out an isolated guitar track of the song only to realise that it does not have the main riff in its whole length, but thanks to the identical music the rhythm section plays, it seems.\n\nTo sum it up, the black album has been misinterpreted as a step into a commercial direction for its simplicity, while it is just as much metal as the previous albums. I can\u2019t recognize the influence of the popular music of that time (e.g. grunge). This release is 100% metal, but a pretty lazy one. Once they invented a verse melody, a chorus, and a riff, the song was musically done, and they just had to throw in a generic solo and repeat said ideas enough to waste 4, 5 or 6 minutes. If the band really sold out, at least we could have a great grunge/alternative album (like Load/Reload have some enjoyable soft songs). Once the first verse and chorus of a song has gone buy, I am thinking \u201cThe rest is just the same, isn\u2019t it?\u201d if you get the reference.\n\nInstead of always encouraging Metallica to become heavier and dropping their influences from other genres, fans should start encouraging them to learn when to end their songs and when to change their guitar tone and speed.\n",
        "\nThis album gets a lot of flak mostly because it doesn't live up to the standards set by Metallica. However, if you take this album on its own and divorce it from the fact that it was put out by the same band that put out Kill 'Em All twenty years earlier, you'll realize that this is a nice slab of amusing, thrashy pop-infused nu-metal.\n\nIt is clear that Metallica was following the trend of the time by down-tuning the guitars and experimenting with the drum sounds, and creating percussive rather than melodic riffs. However, the Load/Reload influence is still felt in certain areas, particularly in the vocal department, especially on songs like \"Sweet Amber\" and \"Shoot Me Again.\" Although I'm not exactly the biggest nu metal fan, I can sometimes appreciate a good down-tuned, simplistic riff along with stream-of-consciousness vocals as a change of pace from standard thrash or death fare. That's another thing about this album; the lyrics definitely don't seem planned or well-thought-out at all. Rather, they seem to be impulsive, defensive reactions to a perceived hostile environment (and isn't that what anger is anyway?).\n\nThis is the type of album that is good to listen to when doing something very frustrating. Frustration might be the one word that I use to describe this album. How satisfying is it to hear \"tick tick tick tock\" or \"kill kill kill kill kill\" when trying to fix a stubborn piece of machinery or tool or cleaning out a drain? Something about the dull repetition of lyrics such as \"We the people... Are we the people?\" or \"Shoot me again I ain't dead yet\" and the trashy (literally) drum sound is conducive to such activities. I think there is something to be said for what this album conveys rather than purely looking at the tracks and comparing them to opuses such as \"Dyers Eve\" or \"Fight Fire With Fire.\" The album conveys an overall feeling of powerlessness to deal with various ills, whether personal or societal, the resulting rage from this powerlessness, and the consequent release of this pent-up aggression through music. Maybe that's how people would describe metal as a whole, but I think what differentiates this album is that it highlights the irrational, unfocused side of anger. Metal (in many genres) is often very specific with its critiques of politics or religion, but this album is very vague and personal rather than making a political statement; that's even reflected in song titles such as \"Some Kind of Monster\", \"Invisible Kid\", and especially \"The Unnamed Feeling.\" It's a clear reflection of where Metallica was at this time, and some would argue that this makes this record more authentic than say Death Magnetic or Hardwired, which could be seen as pandering to the fanbase. It is clear that with St. Anger, good or bad, Metallica did as they pleased.\n\nWith all of this analysis of theme aside, I must say that this is the type of album that I listen to just for memes. Sort of the same idea as System of a Down or Anthrax. It's not meant to be taken seriously (well, maybe it was, but don't). It'll almost certainly cheer you up if you're depressed because of how loony and unhinged James sounds on this album, or if you just picture Lars banging on a trash can while sweating feverishly, and Kirk sipping herbal tea as he watches them play, because let's not forget that he's basically as absent from the album as Jason was on ...And Justice For All, but not because of the mixing. \n\nI mean, it gets pretty bad at points (\"Sweet Amber\" is probably the worst), but there are some pretty decent moments, such as \"look out motherfuckers here I come!\" on \"My World.\" The riffs are fairly decent on many of the tracks, and the whole concept of this album shines through best when James sounds hoarse or unhinged. Many give this album scores ranging from 0% to 20%, but I think scores that low should be reserved for banal pop music. The fact that this is a metal album automatically earns it a score of at least 40%, and when you factor in the comedic value that this album has combined with the actual anguish and/or perplexed-ness James conveys on many of the tracks and some of the good riffs, I think 80% is a fair score.\n",
        "\nReally? Lou Reed and Metallica collaborating on material together? You have to admit, that sounds like a really bad joke. Unfortunately, this thing exists, much to my extreme displeasure. There are so many problems with Lulu, so really, where do I begin?\n\nI guess starting with the vocals is as good as anything else, so why not start with them? So far, I haven't heard Lou Reed's music, so, obviously, I have no idea what he does (well, did, but you get the idea) outside of this project, but it has to be better than what he does here. For fuck's sake, whenever he opens his mouth on Lulu, all I hear is an old decrepit junkie rambling about what-the-fuck-ever, and we'll get to the lyrics. Not only is he disgusting to listen to, but he also has trouble shutting up (why am I suddenly having Grieving Age flashbacks?). Worse still, even if he did a better job, he would still not fit here at all.\n\nNot that Metallica is any better. James Hetfield, who mostly acts as the backing vocalist this time around, sounds like he's not even trying. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but, even on St. Anger, he sounded less dumb that here. I guess he doesn't sound quite as bad as Lou Reed, but given the lyrics... I don't think that changes anything. The riffs sound like they were made on the spot, and even worse, they drone on and on. No use talking about the bass, seeing how I cannot hear it here. Not that it matters, audible bass would not help this anyway. The production, which is some of the sloppiest I've heard in a while, doesn't help matters either. Oh, and the less I say about the drums, the better.\n\nWhen it comes to the structure... [sigh] First, the tracks sound too similar to each other and are interchangeable. Second, they drone on and on with almost no variation worth mentioning. Third, the tracks are way too long; even worse, they would still be horrible even if they were much shorter. Not to mention that the whole album is more than eighty minutes long. All of that makes the tracks pretty much unlistenable. I admit, I couldn't bring myself to finishing any of the tracks. That's how bad it all is.\n\nI might as well finally talk about the lyrics, because why not? I heard this was based on a surrealist or avant-garde play or something like that, but I don't think it really matters, because the lyrics make no sense whatsoever. There is no hidden meaning within them, they look like completely random sentences made up on the spot. Really, just take the infamous 'I am the table!' and try to make any sense of it. There is no way to make this phrase work in any context. Or how about 'I would cut my legs and tits off when I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski...'? What the flying fuck?! Does that look even remotely coherent to you? I didn't think so. I won't even try to give more examples, as I think I made my point.\n\nTo somehow make things even worse, this is the very last thing Lou Reed worked on. I know, I criticized him in this review, but it's a shame he couldn't go out on a better note; like I said, I don't know what he was like as a musician otherwise, but he certainly didn't deserve THIS as his last project.\n\nAll in all, this is rightfully considered a musical abomination. Really, I failed to find any redeeming factors. What were they thinking? This might work as torture music, but I wouldn't recommend Lulu even as that. Metallica may have redeemed themselves to some extent with Hardwired... But Lulu still remains an unwashable stain on their reputation. I just hope nobody else tries to make another Lulu, that would be a low blow to our sanity, to say the least.\n",
        "\nDisclaimer: I don't hate this album, I really don't. By any sane objective measure Lulu is a bad album, indisputably, but I can't lie and say that I don't enjoy it. More on that later.\n\nTypical headass fanboy shit. To even consider listening to this album and suspending any sort of disbelief that it could have any redeeming qualities would require a blind devotion to everything Metallica and Lou Reed have done in their respective pasts--which, unfortunately, is how I came into this album. Metallica? Lou Reed? Fall of 2011? Blood and boobies? This seventh grader was fucking THERE, to a truly unimaginable degree. Sorry--I'm just stalling cause I have no idea how to talk about the pseudo-music on this thing.\n\nI tried to keep this short for my own sanity and because so much has been said about this album already that there are enough nuggets of truth and fairness in each review here and elsewhere that the honest picture of Lulu could be pieced together by a curious and openminded listener/reader. I.e., more than enough has been said about this album and it should just be totally totally left in the past. (\"You hypocrite!\" - my conscience) But even one word about Lulu being written in 2019 is too much, so I figured I might as well buckle down and go to pound town on this thing.\n\nThe riffs are... not good. Mostly buttrock. Possibly not as bad as I Disappear, but that's the most comparable thing I can think of in terms of how insipid and uninspired all the meandering musical bullshit is on legitimately every fucking song. There are hints of melody, in songs like Brandenburg Gate, Iced Honey, Junior Dad, Dragon. It doesn't really matter though. The acapella/acoustic parts where Reed just moans crazy shit like an old crackhead are all so bad that even when the worst, dumbest riff in the world comes in (idk, pick a song) The production on the instrumentals is super bright, compressed to hell, all kinds of eye-roll worthy cliches for that era in production, exactly what such airheaded songwriting deserves. But that's also kind of the thing--nothing on this record is really totally definable as a true \"song.\" There's no structure, no movement--for a concept album about whatever edgy epic story Lou Reed was high on, Lulu is a lot less of the \"take you on a journey\"-type and more of the \"shoot heroin into your gooch for an hour so that at the end of it you're pretty numb and out of it but you still know that something fucked up just happened\"-type.\n\nThe vocals are just complete and total AIDS. I mean to be fair, Reed has always had a unique, often droney voice that has been successful to varying degrees over his career. His performance here is unprecedentedly moany, waily, and every other bad adjective ever made. So yeah the vocals are obviously horrible but more than anything, what really fucks it up here is how the singing is just fucking dropped on top of the instrumentals, with absolutely nothing to bind the two elements together. The vocals and the instruments, they don't mix. There is very, very little rhythmic consistency or compatibility between the two. It happens sometimes, but that is clearly not the intention. The whole point of avant-garde music is to push boundaries, taking a mastery of the craft and contorting it, de- and re-constructing it, etc. etc. Instead, Lulu is just these two washed up morons (or 4, I guess--we can either count Metallica as a singular entity or count each member individually but either way I feel bad for Robbie T and I'd like to leave him out of this) taking lazy nonsense and layering it on top of more lazy nonsense, all completely devoid of thought and intention. Truly, some of the greatest songwriters in rock history (though it's honestly blasphemy to speak of any rock group/songwriter in the same sentence as Reed and the Velvet Underground) hit rock bottom on this stupid shit.\n\nSo what's redeeming about this? I'm giving it a relatively high score--the prestigious, highly sought after mark of 69 that only a few special albums will ever get to wear by my keyboard. Honestly, this album is just purely entertaining. It's so stupid, so ridiculous, so over-the-top absurd that I could easily sit down and listen to it all the way through and then just laugh my ass off. There's maybe only one part on the album that's actually really hysterical in real time, and that's during Pumping Blood: Hetfield is playing just the absolute worst, most pathetic, most old-fart washed-up buttrock struggling-right-hand riff of all time, while Reed is just moaning the craziest shit: \"waggle my ass like a dark prostitute, like a common state worker, swallow your sharpest cutter like a colored man's dick,\" etc. etc., but then comes the kicker, while Hetfield is somehow struggling so hard to keep up, Lou goes: \"Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute, COME ON JAMES!\" Like what the fuck? You batshit crazy motherfuckers, did none of them really see how ridiculous this was?\n\nBut besides that one part, the album isn't funny in the moment. It's the most funny in the retelling, laughing at the idea that you spent over an hour getting trolled with so many levels of irony that nobody even knows who the idiot is or who's getting cucked the most. This album is totally ridiculous, totally worthless, stupid and bad, but I'm so glad it exists.\n",
        "\nMetallica is one of the most common beginner metal bands, and this is definitely true about me. Ride the Lightning was the first metal album I listened to in its entirety and has remained a favorite of mine since. I have been listening to metal now for almost 2 years, and my tastes have morphed rapidly in this time, and I am nowadays mostly listening to prog metal, atmospheric black metal, melodeath, doom, and variations of these genres. I have totally abandoned seeking out new thrash metal because I now see the genre as generally boring and creatively limited, however this album has such stellar songwriting that I cannot help but love it.\n\nThe guitarwork on this album is absolutely amazing, delivering crushing rhythms with the optimal thrash metal rhythm guitar tone. There are countless memorable riffs on this album such as those on \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d, \u201cCreeping Death\u201d, and \u201cFade to Black\u201d. Even the less epic and memorable riffs on songs such as \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d and \u201cTrapped Under Ice\u201d are great. The lead guitar is also a major highlight mixing guitar shredding with emotional melody, always making an appearance at the appropriate times on this album.\n\nAs far as song structures go, Ride the Lightning is somewhat simple, making use of the common verse chorus song structure with solos placed in, however this song structure typically fits the song on this album. Of course there are exceptions such as when a new riff kicks in about 2/3 the way through \u201cFade to Black\u201d which then ended with an amazing solo. Another song structure highlight is the section at 3:40 on \u201cCreeping Death\u201d where a massive riff kicks in with James\u2019 chanting vocals over it. Additionally, a few songs have clean acoustic intros such as \u201cFade to Black\u201d and \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d. These intros are some of the most emotional and enjoyable parts of the album, creating a contrast with the heavy riffage that is present throughout most of the album.\n\nVocally, this album surprisingly satisfies me. I typically don\u2019t like thrash metal style shouts, but James manages to incorporate some good melody in his shouting at times, and knows how to deliver a catchy and memorable chorus. Metallica proves however that they don\u2019t need a vocalist to put out great music with their instrumental album closer \u201cThe Call of Ktulu\u201d. The main riff on this song is one quite possibly my all time favorite thrash metal riff (I don\u2019t like thrash much, but still a major accomplishment).\n\nIf I had to single out an element of this album that I am not crazy about it would be the drums, as they suit the album well, but don\u2019t go that extra mile of truly elevating the quality of this album. Despite this, they don\u2019t hinder my enjoyment of the album, as everything else is amazing.\n\nOverall, Ride the Lightning is one of the most memorable albums I have ever listened to. The songwriting and riff writing here transcend just about everything else that thrash has to offer and is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the genre. There is no boring moment on this album, as this album is jam packed with fun, emotion, and creativity.\n\nBest songs: For Whom the Bell Tolls, Creeping Death, Fade to Black, The Call of Ktulu, Ride the Lightning\n",
        "\nA new installment of Metallica returns to revive among its followers (and not so followers already) the usual discussion that have always surrounded the band\u00b4s new works for already more than a decade: \"Do they sell out?\" Metallica, after adding more gasoline to the fire when they publicly outdoor theirs miseries in the documentary 'Some Kind of Monster', accompanies this new release with the conviction that this time they managed to return to their origins and their golden times\u00b4 old sound.\n\nA tentative come back to theirs roots that, although this time seems firmer and have more foundation, the truth is that after listening to their new work we discover, that despite an effort for putting out a record that wannabe sounding like their 80\u00b4s works, they have not achieved the level of their glorious years . Rick Rubin, a real guru of the musical scene that has produced several albums of Slayer (the true owners of the thrash metal\u00b4s spirit), was the elected producer and this should indicate that Metallica had put a great effort to do a huge come back to the old days... they even brought back the original logo of the band!\n\nBut despite taking care to sound instrumentally as before, something that musicians like them can really do whenever they want, we discover that it does not bring anything new and that their new compositions are not at all brilliant. They lack a lot of feeling in their new songs. The songs don\u00b4t connect with the listener and that's something that they had plenty in the past and that made Metallica became a band with a global popularity above many of the rest of the bands of their generation. Once the sound is recovered (more or less) they should worry imperiously to recover the lost feeling.\n\nA proof of Metallica creative crisis is found by listening their new songs in which it seems that the band have limited themselves to join the first guitar riffs they happened in their mind without any order or coherence and therefore the songs show little cohesion. The point is that you can recover your sound, which is very good, but now it is necessary to recover the creativity because without that spark your work will go down in history simply as an another record more, a plain and grey album and without any interest.\n\nIf the guitars are powerful, and sometimes become very fast, the drummer appears on this record as a subordinate. Lars Ulrich limits himself to complying with his rhythmic base work being easily the weakest element of the record. He does not even follow fast rhythms in order to match the guitars\u00b4 pace. Only in the track that closes the album, 'My Apocalypse', Lars Ulrich makes a feint of recovery introducing more dash in percussion, hopefully at least he start the next album as it ends this.\n\nThe guitar solos give the impression of having already been heard on another time which is not a good indicator of freshness. To James Hetfield, and Metallica therefore, is hurting his love of country music because the way James sing sometimes sounds strange and forced. Metallica also did not forget to introduce mid tempos like 'The day that never comes', as it has always been usual in them, although this time in the second part of the song they increase the tempo and give us a powerful climax. They also include on the album the third part of Unforgiven, a very orchestrated track and, very much in line with the albums released after the Black Album.\n\nAs for the songs\u00b4 structure they recovered the complexity of for example '... And Justice For All' with several parts and exceeding seven minutes long reaching up to almost ten as in 'Suicide & Redemption'.\n\nMaking a long story short: this patient, who was in a coma, now seems to evolve favorably, hopefully the improvement will continue.\n\n(Originally written in Spanish for musiqueando.com)\n",
        "\nWhat inspired me to write this review more than anything was listening to some people, whose tastes I respect a ton, say that ...And Justice for All is their least favorite of the first 5 Metallica records. I mean what the fuck? Of course, what that statement is really saying is that the Black Album is better than Justice, which in my mind is true mental ward crazy talk. I really don't get it, but I wanted to take the space to actually understand the critiques of this album.\n\nIf Master of Puppets and Cliff's death was the climax of Metallica's good years (1981-91, ultimately the only years of the band that matter from a musical quality standpoint imo), then ...And Justice for All is the dark and brooding resolution and the halfway point between thrash glory and bittersweet buttrock disgrace. But it also might be giving AJFA too much credit to have one of the main reasons for liking it be that its successor was a boring hard rock stumble. And it's also important to recognize that for what it is, the Black Album is pretty sick. It has the anthems, it has the ballad, the weird twisting riffs, the really heavy production, all these things showing that even if Metallica was gonna sell out they were still gonna write songs that were unique and intriguing. And if you love the Black Album, you think its a big balls hard rock masterpiece, then it's pretty easy to understand why you would think of AJFA as a minor blip between the undeniable perfection of Master of Puppets and the pretty deniable perfection of the Black Album.\n\nEven an AJFA devotee like me has to address it's shortcomings. The production sucks so hard. Ride the Lightning and MOP were both so bombastic and AJFA is so fucking thin, and obviously the bass is just entirely not there. Would Justice have been a better album, the third perfect album in a row, if they had just put the goddamn bass on the record? Truly one of the most tragic and unanswerable questions, the most torturous \"what if?\" in metal history.\n\nThe songs are also long. This critique I really never understood, because to me \"Metallica\" has always been synonymous with \"long songs with heavy riffs, fast riffs, and brilliant song structure\". On Justice, I think it's just that every song more or less pushes 7 minutes that it's possible to get worn out. But honestly, what's the big fucking deal? The riffs on Justice are soul-crushing, depressive, and intense. They provide more than enough interesting material to keep each song afloat. This ain't no St. Anger. Even the deeper, arguably weaker cuts like Shortest Straw and Frayed Ends of Sanity have undeniable moods to them that remain dark and heavy even with no bass. I think what ultimately trips people up about the length of this record is that it's hard to listen to shitty thin production for over an hour. Thinness isn't some quality in an album production sound that someone can like or dislike--it's literally just something that takes a toll on your ears period. I can still think it sounds sick and depraved, but that can't change the fact that the physical act of hearing that annoying ass racket fucks with your brain a little. So really, as far as I can tell, the true sole problem of Justice is the production--something we all knew from the start.\n\nFinally, the loss of Cliff Burton is a tragedy and of course fundamentally changed the trajectory of the band. I am not really prepared to speak on how he was the true brains behind the band, the best musician of the group by far, and all-around one of the most legendary and inspiring metal figures of all time. But his death is a necessary foreground for the birth of Justice, its basslessness, its *slightly* inferior songwriting to MOP and RTL, and the band's decision to sell the fuck out a few years later.\n\nNow with all that out of the way, I want to judge Justice on its own merits, separate from its mammoth predecessors or tragic successors. Every song on Justice, except for maybe the two mentioned previously and To Live is to Die, are no-brainer competitors for being some of the best Metallica songs ever. This is especially true for Blackened and Harvester of Sorrow, the rightful fan favorites to this day. One of two main rippers, Blackened is a straight up perfect song with its breakneck speed, apocalyptic atmosphere, and one of Kirk's best solos as well all 3 verse/chorus riffs being some of James' best. Blackened also does something incredibly important, which is set the tone for the rest of the album to come. It's fast, it's heavy, it has a progressive feel without fundamentally changing the Metallica feel that was established in the two previous records, and its lyrics are grave and chaotic (see the next paragraph). I wanted to avoid talking about One, because there isn't anything that interesting to say about it, other than it's a legitimately amazing and definitive Metallica song. Double bass is cool. War is hell. The length of these songs, in my opinion, is truly an asset. As far as I'm concerned, by going from rightfully cocky and to-the-point on MOP to depraved, brooding, and musically violent (something that could only be said for a few previous songs, I'm thinking Damage Inc./Fight Fire with Fire/Metal Militia) on AJFA while keeping their solid intuition for song structures that really grab the listener, they more than justified the length of each individual song and of the album as a whole.\n\nWatching James' lyrics shift across the first four Metallica albums is such a fascinating thing, and tracing that progression in its entirety unfortunately can't be done in this review. Conveniently however, the biggest lyrical change from album to album is from Master to Justice. MOP is about war, drugs, greed, and terror, same as AJFA, but the two records approach those topics in different ways. Compare One to Disposable Heroes--the strictly first-person story of a single soldier whose life was destroyed by war in the former, versus the more general (with both first- and third-person voices) portrayal of the carnage of war and of how soldiers are dehumanized on the latter. If MOP is defined by violence, then maybe AJFA is defined by agony and despair (see Dyers Eve, Blackened, Frayed, etc.). If James was just hypothesizing an intense first-person experience in Sanitarium, he is actually suffering and losing his mind on Harvester and Dyers Eve. Needless to say, his voice was still hard as nails and would be (live at least, because the Black Album crooning I really could do without) up until Load. The most commonly talked about lyrical difference is the political-ness of the title track (and Blackened if you care about the environment), and this is very valid too. The greed and corruption of the state on the song mirrors the callout of (tel)evangelism and that kind of shit on Leper Messiah. Also super notable is what's missing from the album: there's no Ktulu/witchcrafty stuff, no quasi-empowerment lyrics (Escape), and certainly no NWOBHM lyrical/musical worship. Justice means business, and that business means leaving the more juvenile Metallica motifs in the past. I could get into specifics, but this and so much more about the lyrical content is a huge reason why Justice is so bleak and dark and brutal in new and different ways.\n\nI'm done. While I think it doesn't makes sense to argue that AJFA is Metallica's best album, simply because it doesn't have Cliff, it also doesn't make sense to call this album anything less than a 10/10 A+ just like the first three Met albums. It goes places and tries ideas that went unexplored by RTL and MOP. Can you believe how far they progressed from Kill 'Em All, in just 5 years? Considering the Black Album as more-or-less trash and worshipping this album along with the first 3 is an absolute no-brainer to me.\n",
        "\nIt was an early summer evening following a gig by a high school aged Metallica tribute band, where a few of its members were chilling out in the drummer's living room and flipping the television channels. By happenstance the channel tunes into MTV and footage of a live performance featuring said tribute band's object of homage fills the air, and the image of James Hetfield's goatee and short hair sparks a debate among the viewers. In typical fashion, the old school metal camp within the band notes that the band sounds washed out and tired, simultaneously lamenting that they have to cover material that came after the 80s, while the new school camp makes excuses by saying that James and company are just staying with the times and that everybody eventually gets old and slows down. This experience is actually an autobiographical one, as the author of this review played bass in said tribute band, and the conversation happened in 1998 when Hetfield was in his mid-30s.\n\nIf there is any relevance to be gleaned from the preceding story, it is that the \"Band X is just maturing\" canard doesn't really hold up to logical scrutiny, particularly when considering the surprising return to form in Hardwired...To Self-Destruct that was about as brash and immature as they come, and was unleashed nearly 20 years after James Hetfield began attempting to channel Waylon Jennings. The truth of how a band that originally billed itself as \"louder and faster\" than the glam-steeped L.A. sleaze scene getting all country rockin' and boring on everyone rests somewhere else, and if their latest acoustic live album and charitable venture Helping Hands...Live & Acoustic At The Masonic is any indication, part of it lies with a highly misguided fetish for genre-hopping. In all fairness, a fair number of Metallica's fans have weathered enough twists and turns over the past couple decades to be able to stomach more than an hour of covers and thrash classics arranged to sound like \"Mama Said\", but yours truly ain't one of them.\n\nOne thing that can be said for this performance is that it is an ambitious undertaking, as the songs are generally long in length and a small collection of additional musicians have been tapped to provide mandolin, pedal-steel, keyboards and various percussion instruments to fully synthesize a large scale country and blues concert. Likewise, the overall production quality of the recording is a well-polished exercise in clarity and balance where everything is audible and crisp, save for Lars' occasionally over-loud drumming (give that arrhythmic troglodyte some brushes to hit that snare with please!) and occasional voice cracks out of Hetfield. Nevertheless, the rearrangement of classic thrash monsters like \"Disposable Heroes\", \"Four Horsemen\" and the more recent neck-breaker \"Hardwired\" just fall flat, sounding more like comical gimmicks than actual earnest reinterpretations. Generally the faster things get, the more sloppy they tend to become, whereas old school rocking covers of \"Turn The Page\", \"Please Don't Judas Me\" and \"Veteran Of The Psychic Wars\" are more plodding to the point of being sleep-inducing.\n\nThere are naturally a few bright spots in this otherwise overlong sea of blemishes upon the face of Metallica's fading legacy, largely owing to the songs in question being better suited to transitioning into the acoustic medium and already having a bluesy tinge to them. The shiniest silver lining is \"Nothing Else Matters\", which sees James recapturing the mixture of subtlety and measured grit that made the original version an undisputed classic, and the extra musicians being put to good use in revamping the song's atmosphere. The reinterpretation of \"Enter Sandman\" also finds itself working surprisingly well, although Kirk's attempts at busting out the original solo on an acoustic guitar hits a few sour notes and only halfway closes the deal. And while far from a perfect rendition of Deep Purple's original classic, \"When A Blind Man Cries\" has a certain poignant character in an acoustic context that plays fairly well to James' largely country and western croon and occasional aging baritone gruff vocal duality.\n\nWhile it would be a bit unfair to really jump down Metallica's throat for botching a live album that was meant to be a one-off charitable venture and not necessarily reflective of the band shifting their musical paradigm yet again, this isn't really something that would be worth the average metal head's time. There will naturally be a fair share of sycophantic types out there that will follow this band into the darkest depths of Nashville-based cousin-lovin', but apart from a few extraneous gimmicks and the fairly laid back and intimate atmosphere established by James' more clean cut and friendly asides between songs, there isn't really much for even the rabid completist to really sink their teeth into. This is old and tired music from a band that was coming off as old and tired when they were the same age that Lemmy was when Motorhead first recorded Ace Of Spades, so shrug it off and here's to hoping that grandpa sees fit to give us another thrashing studio effort before they retire to the nursing home.\n",
        "\nWell meaning, occasionally good, mostly boring, Metallica's little fundraising live album is in every way redolent of your grandma's Christmas presents, of that one really dense philosophy book you slogged your way through, of that one classical album that you made yourself listen to so you could sound a bit cultured. Ie, not entirely shit but I'm not gonna revisit the thing as a whole again for a long time.\n\nThere's a bit of humour throughout, Hetfield sounds old but in a good way (and there's a falsetto in Bleeding Me?!?), there's clearly been a fair bit of care in the arrangements what with the extra dudes providing harmonies and slide guitar and that little fucken egg shaker etc etc. When it works it's pretty neat. Bleeding Me is quite a beautiful little ditty, Disposable Heroes works far better than you'd think, Four Horseman is a lot of fun reimagined as a rollicking country tune, so on and so on. I'm not a big expert on acoustic-bothering music but overall it's some kinda weird blustery mix of fairly traditional country and folk, with a whole lot of guitar parts that are lifted from the originals and thus clash a bit weirdly. It's not a terrible base sound, albeit not something that's gonna get you super pumped.\n\nIt's also way too long, suffers from some terrible song selection and Ulrich is way out his depth. I don't particularly hate our Danish friend, but his \"hit the drums really hard and do really slow fills\" technique is even more exposed here than it is in normal Metallica, what with no wall of guitars to hide behind. It doesn't ruin songs but it certainly doesn't add much. The song selection, well, for every banger there's All Within My Hands, the comatose Sandman rearrangement, Please Don't Judas Me etc there's a lot of very sleepy tunes. Combined with the ridiculous album length and it's a long, turgid ride if you're trying to one shot it. Fingers crossed next time it's a shorter album with a tendency towards faster or at least much more energetic/more suitable tunes.\n\nIt's not shit. But it's certainly a fans only release and I'll probably only play Bleeding Me again now that I've done reviewing it. It's for a good cause and all that, which is admirable, but you're better off slinging a $20 to the next red cross dude you see.\n",
        "\n\u201cOh my\u2026 what on earth is bayern doing, just before retirement? Tackling the Metallica exploits\u2026 has he got to say/write anything different from what has already been said/written about this mythical opus?!\u201d\n\nQuite honestly, I don\u2019t; and neither has any self-respected scribe, for that matter; cause the whole review-grading scale has already been covered thousands of times here and elsewhere, from one extreme to the other, with all the more or less necessary details\u2026 the thing is that I gave this album a listen the other night, and for a big change I decided to pass through the song that I have been skipping for the past 30 or so years,\n\n\u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d\n\nIt was amazing to find out how very well I remember it, having not listened to it for such a huge period of time, with all its gloomy doomy details. Why?! It beats me very hard on the head to the point of a most serious, brain-damaging (inc.) concussion. But more on that later\u2026\n\nMetallica\u2019s staggering success continues to befuddle me; it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t deserve it, but I\u2019ve been trying to detect vestiges of the logical upward trajectory in their career that must have led to the top\u2026 and I haven\u2019t been able to. Having in mind that the band peaked very early, on the sophomore to be precise, before even the whole thrash metal carnival had been fully shaped, there was no way, and respectively time, for any trajectory of the kind to be formed. Then I guess we all have to blame it on this Blackest of Albums, released at the dawn of a new decade, a visionary recording that captured the audience\u2019s imagination so strongly that its enormous (death) magnetic, inertia-amassing impact still brings in the revenue some 28 years down the line, ultimately blurring the memories of \u201cloads\u201d, \u201creloads\u201d and other miscalculated flops along the way. No wonder I started wearing black almost exclusively in the early-90\u2019s; it has remained my favourite colour all these years (yeah, right!)\u2026\n\nlistening to this gravely serious, inordinately officiant opus here, I can\u2019t help but respect the guys for having chosen this more commercially-viable path, the one of the genre-stretching, more message-oriented repertoire. On the other hand, if you think of it, 20-something (barely) lads, having entertained the fanbase previously with \u201cHit the Lights\u201d and \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d\u2026 had they really chosen it for themselves, I mean voluntarily: \n\n\u201clisten lads, I think we should start thinking about how to conquer this music industry, how to ride it ingloriously like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I have this nudging feeling that the music crown is ours for the taking\u2026 don\u2019t laugh here, hey! I\u2019m serious. We should give it a try if nothing else. The thing is that if we keep moshing like demented on \u201cWhiplash\u201d and \u201cTrapped Under Ice\u201d, showing middle fingers left and right, and get drunk every second night, we will never get the chance. So why not get serious for a change, just for an experiment? To see if we could kill\u2019em all, literally? What do you say?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure who may have come up with this statement of intent, but such a scenario was pretty possible some time in the middle of 1985; yeah, the guys had decided to leave the pungent stench of gasoline from their parents\u2019 garages where they had been rehearsing day in day out, far behind and aim for the nice, posh studios. The album reviewed here by no means reeks of expensive perfumes and queens\u2019 chambers\u2019 fragrancies, but its much more officiant, intentionally academic lustre is hard to disguise although both \u201cBattery\u201d and the title-track are such magnanimous, sincerely spread-out compositions that those two alone should suffice to shoot the album into the stratosphere. Reaching the level of its brilliant predecessor? Totally\u2026 if one, just one, thing hadn\u2019t happened:\n\n\u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d\n\nIn any other normal, more morally-advanced planet around the Universe, especially the ones I have already visited, Flemming Rasmussen would have been crucified right upon release. Or maybe not\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe he and the boys thought that they could get away by placing the weakest cut right after the two best ones. And they amazingly did, like both the commercial and critical results had subsequently shown, although to these ears this track is such a mood killer that a more impressionable, also more demanding, listener would have instantly reconsidered his high estimates formed under the influence of the first two. It\u2019s really hard to view this monotonous, one-dimensional chugger as an enhancer of any kind, and smacked right after the mentioned two showdowns when the fans were all, without exception, anticipating another mad thrashing skirmish\u2026 it\u2019s not easy, not easy at all to find an excuse for its presence so early in the album.\n\nA few years back I thought about how to possibly soften the not very positive impact from this \u201cthing\u201d; here\u2019s how, with some help from the Horsemen themselves:\n\n\u201clet\u2019s try and re-arrange the tracks on our supposed magnum opus a bit more appropriately, guys; we\u2019ve nothing else to do anyway. With all due respect to Flemming, the man should have looked/listened better; and where on earth were we at the time as well?!\n\n1.\tBattery\n2.\tMaster of Puppets\n(great beginning, those two; no comments)\n3.\tDisposable Heroes\n(the thrashing has to go on, god damn it; did we really think we had gotten the job done with two raving masterpieces, to keep the whole world moshing? Let\u2019s think again\u2026)\n4.\tSanitarium\n(the necessary calm after the storm, great stuff, not very sleep-inducing, quite edgy as well; there has to be some end to the madness, after all)\n5.\tLeper Messiah\n(nice varied package, stomping mid-pacedness plus a couple of explosive outbreaks, a little bit for everyone)\n6.\tOrion\n(time for the obligatory instrumental variations; this one\u2019s a bit overlong and maybe not very eventful, but hey, we put our hearts and musical diplomas into it, remember? And, there\u2019s never anything wrong with providing a soundtrack for the multiple stargazers out there\u2026)\n7.\tThe Thing That Should Not Be\n(yeah\u2026 couldn\u2019t have come up with a more self-explanatory title even if our lives depended on it\u2026 but we created it, this Frankenstein-like behemoth; what could we do, we had to include it. Besides, we had nothing else to replace it with\u2026 no, no, no; we can\u2019t pretend that this thing never happened, enough with this!)\n8.\tDamage, Inc.\n(brilliant stuff; damaging indeed, full-throttle mosh to the ultimate death\u2026 sorry, damage; after all, we were still young, overtly enthusiastic thrashers back then\u2026 right? Right?!)\u201d\n\nYeah, that\u2019s definitely more like it, thanks guys. Well, for me personally this layout makes more sense also making \u201cSanitarium\u201d sticking more prominently as a desirable respiteful diversion from the initially encountered thrashing spree; the \u201cthing\u201d as its immediate predecessor emphasizes on its idyllic qualities more with the introspective mood deepened, something a supposed thrash metal recording shouldn\u2019t be deliberately looking for. It\u2019s not that the band have problems later recapturing the hyper-active riff-patterns from the beginning, but even as a possible element of surprise \u201cSanitarium\u201d would have worked better if separated from this third in order of the Sun. The \u201cthing\u201d itself would have been way more effective if placed as the pen-ultimate track, right before \u201cDamage, Inc.\u201d, a brooding not very eventful stomper respectfully brushed aside by the thrashing fury unleashed on the final roller-coaster\u2026 not terribly bad, not necessarily very noticeable, not pulsating like a sore thumb in the middle. \n\nElsewhere there\u2019s very little wrong with this effort, especially when it became clear that the audience was quite willing to embrace thrash metal\u2019s more serious face. Neither truly ground-breaking nor genre-killing, it showed where the guys were standing at this point in time, determined to take themselves seriously as well as the whole thrash metal parade which, whether the fanbase liked it or not, was simply not going to be the same afterwards. With calculation and premeditation taking over from spontaneity and youthful vigour, this couldn\u2019t have possibly been \u201cRide the Lightning II\u201d\u2026 and yet again, how this opus here worked its magic on the audience to such an extent is mind-boggling; thrash literally became a hot commodity that everyone wanted to have in his/her household all of a sudden. However, did we, the hard-boiled thrashers, feel genuinely happy seeing our favourite music an attraction item for the Depeche Mode and the U2 lovers? Cause this was exactly the case in the late-80\u2019s\u2026\n\nI personally can\u2019t answer this question as I was by no means the most devout thrash maniac out there; in fact, I wasn\u2019t thrash-savvy at all when this effort got released. I only possessed the album here, Destruction\u2019s first two and Anthrax\u2019s \u201cSpreading the Disease\u201d from the thrash roster back in those days, and also had half an hour from Megadeth\u2019s \u201cPeace Sells\u2026\u201d on side A (or B) of a worn-out Sony cassette on which my father accidentally stepped one day and broke. I did like this \u201cmasterful\u201d opus a lot, though, and not only because one could hear it from literally every corner, the four Horsemen racing with their German brethren from Accept for the \u201cthe most popular metal act in Bulgaria\u201d title. I was shouting \u201cMaster\u2026 Master!\u201d, trying to sound as intimidating as possible, alongside the other metalheads being aware, beyond the shadow of a doubt at the time, that I was listening to something truly wonderful and formidable. After all it was METALLICA, the name says it all, the absolute epitome of all things metal both name and music-wise.\n\nLater both \u201cRide\u2026\u201d and \u201cKill\u2019Em All\u201d became more frequently rotated listens in my house, but I can\u2019t help but go back to this opus; I even feel guilty now for having skipped this third number so many times. How the hell did God not punish me for this by breaking my cassette recorder/CD player? I\u2019m pretty sure the Almighty spins this disc/vinyl now and then up there, too, from beginning to end, I mean; no skippings\u2026 there are no miscalculations, no ill-advised creations for him; everything is just the way it is, no judgemental ramblings attached\u2026 anything coming from the mind of God has its rightful place and time in the universe, and is/was bound to happen.\n",
        "\nI understand that a Metallica review today might be one of the more redundant exercises in writing about music, but hear me out. If there was a Metallica album that was in need of more reviewing, this is it. Not part of the much lauded holy trinity of thrash that preceded it or the string of sharply polarising and much derided works that followed, ...and Justice for All is neither famous (aside from 'One') nor infamous - it's simply there for most listeners, an odd diversion by the band that led to nothing. Which is a shame, as it's easily my favourite Metallica album. I firmly believe it to be one of the greatest metal albums ever conceived, and an incredibly unique one at that.\n\nIt's probably the most controversial and legendary aspect of the album, and to my mind the most important: the production. It really is as dry and sterile as everyone says - there is no warmth to the sound at all. Everything sounds very thin and trebly, and while there are bass frequencies to the sound there is indeed no bass guitar to be heard. I know for a lot of listeners that this is a major turn-off (though I've never had a problem with the way the album sounded, this may be because it was one of my first metal albums and as such the sound didn't strike me as especially odd, no stranger than the albums that came before it), however I can't imagine this album without it, and I highly doubt the album would benefit from a more normal sound. It's not an accessible or indeed objectively good production style at all; however it casts every single second of the songs in a new light, by stripping the instrumentation of any human touch they may have had. What would be a warm, reverby drum kit is now a stark, clicking yet thudding timekeeper that marches in the background, and the guitars turn into serrated, thin razors that grind away endlessly. And while it was terrible of the band to haze Newstead by turning him right down, I do believe the removal of the bass guitar only furthers the coldness of the sound - the album is better for it.\n\nThis harsher, colder backdrop fits perfectly with the vocal performance, which is another notable aspect of this album. Never before did James ever sound this angry, or bitter, or resentful. He easily delivers his harshest, heaviest and *best* vocal performance here, without question, and is given a rougher edge by the production. Paired with intelligent but still memorable and concise lyrics on environmental destruction, corruption in the justice system, wanton psychotic violence and the horrors of warfare, and you have the righteous anger of a man disillusioned of the world delivered over the most aggressive sounding riffs and drum beats Metallica would ever write. Slow burning, almost grooving tracks like 'Harvester of Sorrow' or 'Eye of the Beholder' become relentless crushers that flatten all in their path. Already supercharged barnstormers like 'Dyers Eve' or 'Blackened' become some of the most intense thrash ever written; the former in particular still floors me to this day with its rapid fire gun-like double bass and unbridled resentment.\n\nIt's not as if the instrumentation is merely a backdrop, either. More often than not it takes centre stage, and even peering behind the vocals reveals incredible performances all around. As has been mentioned, some of the band's most aggressive and destructive riffing comes through here ('Dyers Eve', 'The Shortest Straw'), and even during the more mid-paced moments the riffs still shine as being highly memorable, with the band working some monolithic grooves into their songs ('Harvester of Sorrow' or the descending riff of 'The Frayed Ends of Sanity'; a nice fit to the theme of the song) and lacing these slower moments with chugs, giving rise to a drudging heaviness not unlike doom metal. The same can be said of the drum performance; when Lars isn't functioning solely as a timekeeper several of the patterns and fills on here are quite technical, and on the whole Lars pounds away on the kit relentlessly, particularly with that distinct pattern on the title track or the incessant double bass of 'Dyers Eve'. The soloing is at its most technical too, it's not a major point when they occupy relatively short slots in these much longer songs but they do serve to give a little variation to the album, a brief respite from the endless onslaught of riffing.\n\nA complaint this album often receives is the sheer repetition of the material, and a general sense of the album being too long for its own good. To my ears however, this is part of the reason for the album's potent atmosphere. The riffs repeat for relatively long stretches of time, as do the drums. In doing so, combined with the sound and atmosphere already present, they take on a very mechanical and almost... industrial feel to them. The likes of 'Eye of the Beholder' or 'To Live is to Die' really build on this with a principal chugging, groovy riff being repeated for most of the song. Instead of making the riffs or beats stale, the repetition adds to their power, by turning them into a principal reference point that guides each song to keep them on track. It keeps the songs direct and focused, even when they approach 10 minutes in length. It also adds to the coldness of the backdrop the lyrics are set against; there is no natural variation to be found, only unyielding repetition of guitars and drums grinding against one another.\n\nThe feel of this album is unlike one I've ever encountered. At times sorrowful and touching (the halfway point of 'To Live is to Die' or the first half of 'One'), and at times driven purely by rage - many thrash albums can do both, but none make it quite as visceral as this. That in and of itself is quite an achievement, given what they're working with; they've turned one of the most mechanical sounding albums into one that conveys human emotion better than so many others. They made a focused, energetic album with a handful of riffs when some bands don't manage that with 246. This is without question one of the greatest metal albums, and one that has aged so gracefully as to be more effective now than it was 30 years ago - perhaps due to general resentment towards the world increasing since then, but also because nothing since has come close to achieving what it has, a fact that rings more and more true with each passing day. A forgotten experiment this may have been - but certainly not a fruitless one.\n",
        "\nI know, I know. On the list of things the world needs right now, another fucking Master of Puppets review is pretty well near the bottom of the list. But honestly, I just got a wild hair up my ass and I want to talk about Metallica. Suck it up, nerds.\n\nMetallica has somehow managed to survive no less than three or four extinction level career-enders throughout the years, and in many ways they're a constant punchline in the underground, for some valid reasons (the Napster lawsuit, St. Anger, the utter fucking absurdity of their reissues of classic albums), and some less valid (the Some Kind of Monster documentary, \"selling out\" with Load and cutting their hair in the 90s, whatever beautifully awful avant-garde disaster Lulu was), but I think it's easy to forget that once upon a time they were actually really god damned good. Metallica ruled the fuckin' roost in the 80s, and I think it's easy to lose sight of just how big and impressive they were simply because we live in the internet age and can hear their more extreme contemporaries like Slayer or Dark Angel with a two second youtube search. They were never the fastest or angriest or most brutal band in the world, but I think a big part of the charm is that they neither seemed to claim nor try to be. They always just sorta did their own thing, helping to solidify what thrash metal was in the first place and then pretty much immediately breaking their own rules and doing weird shit like writing nine minute long instrumentals and punctuating blistering riff assaults with major-key doodly melodic shit. They were never the only band doing these things, obviously, but they did have the biggest stage by the time the latter half of the decade rolled around and they leaned into what made them stand out.\n\nTo get one thing out of the way right off the bat, Master of Puppets is by no means their zenith, and in fact is actually an inferior 1:1 copy of it. Ride the Lightning is better in almost every conceivable way. The riffs are better, the songs are more well constructed, it has fucking \"Creeping Death\" on it, which was my favorite song in the world when I was a little kid and to this day I'd probably still put it in my top ten, it's just the superior record by almost every single metric. The only areas where I'd say this album has the edge are the production (which is chunkier and heavier) and the vocals (which honestly just comes down to preference, I love the zit-faced voice-cracking exuberance of the first two albums but I'd give the edge to the slightly deeper and gruffer voice James starts sporting from here on out). I know it's old hat to point out but the tracklist is ordered nearly identically as well, and it's something they'd stick to for basically the rest of their career. Quiet intro leading into fast thrasher - title track (usually fast thrasher) - midpaced chuggy song - ballad - fast thrasher - midpaced melodic one - then usually the instrumental before closing on another fast thrasher (this was flipped on Ride but holds true on every other album that apes the formula). Again, on a 1v1 comparison, Ride wins 7/8 times, with only \"Leper Messiah\" being clearly superior to \"Escape\".\n\nBut I'm not here to talk about how it's not as good as something else, I'm here to talk about how good it is on its own, and dammit it is good. And it's good for kinda weird reasons at times. One thing about the band in general that I didn't really appreciate until I was a bit older is just how fucking good of a rhythm player James Hetfield is. Ask any guitar player and they'll tell you the same thing. The man's dedication to downpicking damn near everything no matter the speed is unreal, his right wrist probably has a six pack. Playing something like \"Disposable Heroes\" in one shot is a fucking endurance test for your picking hand, and he manages all of these things flawlessly. It's not the most glamorous position in the world to be one of the best rhythm guitarists out there, but almost all of the band's tightness comes entirely from him.\n\nAnd therein lies one of the things I love most about this album, it is somehow simultaneously their tightest offering while still being really loose. Like a pair of bellbottoms, it's tight in the balls and loose at the ankles. There are tempo shifts all over the place that the band obviously handles masterfully, but there are times where everything seems to kinda fall apart and it still sounds completely intentional. Listen to \"Battery\" and really pay attention to the verse riff in relation to the vocals. They almost sound like they're in completely different time sigs in completely different tempos. The powerchords hit at strange, offputting times against the natural cadence of the lyrics, and it's all so god damned natural sounding that I never really noticed it until my 400th listen. Also check out the verse riff to the title track. The conventional wisdom (and official transcription) is that the verse riff consists of three measures in 4/4 time and tails on one measure of 5/8. But if you actually play it as written it sounds completely wrong. Switch that last bit to 6/8 and it sounds even wronger. In actuality, through no real intention, that bar is actually played in fucking 21/32, purely because the guys were just playing by ear and doing whatever sounded right to them, and adding in that one random 32nd note of pause should've been a flow-breaking disaster that instead hits like a fucking hammer. None of this was intentional progginess by a group of theory nerds, it's just what happens when you play by feeling and just run with the natural ebb and flow of your own manic riff-energy. \n\nThose two previous points tie into another thing I didn't really appreciate or understand until I was older, and that was just how... fucking weirdly wrong Lars's drumming is. I didn't even notice this until it was pointed out to me, but he actually kinda fails miserably at the drummer's main fundamental job in any band. He is not the timekeeper of the band, James is. Whether his ineffable tightness is a coincidental complement or a learned necessity to Lars's bizarre, Bill Wardian sloppiness is up for debate, but that's what I meant when I said the band is tight entirely because of him earlier. I had always thought of Lars as a brain dead simple rock drummer miscast in a thrash band, and I still think that to an extent, but once you start to really pick apart his performances you start to realize just how frequently he adds in rolling snare fills and random cymbal crashes at the least comprehensible times. Listen to the outro of \"Orion\". Just what the hell are you doing man? Why is that china crash happening that one random ass time? Why are you starting bars on random tom hits? This odd looseness to his playing only amplifies that \"tight but loose\" thing I was talking about, the band is basically playing in free time but still sound like laser-guided riff machines. And even with his incredibly obvious flaws, I always thought Lars (weak link though he is) was absolutely irreplaceable when it came to Metallica. His style is so much more basic than pretty much every other thrash drummer, and I feel like his simplistic backbeats are a huge part of their identity and a big reason why they became as popular as they did in the first place. Think about a track like \"Disposable Heroes\" or \"Damage, Inc.\" and then think about how much fucking meaner and more extreme they would be if the only change was that Lars was replaced with Dave Lombardo or Ventor or something. Would they be better? I dunno, that's up to you to decide, but they would undoubtedly be much different if they were played in super precise double time and that one single change could make those songs simply un-Metallica.\n\nI realize this is already getting pretty long and is very stream-of-consciousness, but honestly this is just a result of my lifelong relationship with the album. My taste has quite obviously veered off into far more extreme directions over the years, but I've liked Metallica for literally as long as I've had memories, and I simply can not understate how utterly obsessed with them I was for years and years on end. There are dozens of albums I've loved since I was a kid but comparatively few they I have actual memories tied to them. For example, I think the seed for what would eventually blossom into my adulthood love of H.P. Lovecraft was planted more from \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" more than any other pop culture reference. It certainly helps that I love the song on its own, I love that creepy, watery intro and I love how brutally it grinds along at a sluggish pace, repeatedly smashing you over the head over and over again until you're begging for a reprieve. I can see why some would call it boring and repetitive, but god damn it works for me. But no, what entranced me were the lyrics. I know now that it's just kind of a lazy copy and paste of random Lovecraftian buzzwords, but when you're 8 years old you don't know that shit, dude. To me it was so fucking dark and sinister and I felt almost like I was hearing something that I shouldn't. It felt forbidden to my tiny brain. I so distinctly remember laying on my bedroom floor while this song was playing, writing down the lyrics as I heard them and then drawing the images the lyrics conjured. I know that what impressed me decades ago should mean nothing now that I'm a big brained boy, but simply hearing that chugging main riff instantly teleports me back to a sepia-toned warm-and-fuzzy of me doodling squiggly black-cloaked cultists conjuring an incomprehensible monster from the depths of a stormy sea. Yeah I'm not being \"objective\" or whatever but if you're looking for objectivity in one of my reviews you can go eat sand and fuck back off to Minecraft you simpering git.\n\nAnd since I've already gone this in-depth and personal, I might as well spray \"Orion\" with as much of my Burton Fanboy goo as possible. It really isn't a stretch to say that \"Orion\" single-handedly solidified my choice to pick up a bass for the first time. My heroes when I first started actually playing and writing (or at least attempting to write) my own music were Cliff and Geezer and basically nobody else, and I can't overstate how important this song was to me during that time. All eight and a half minutes of this are coded into the muscles on my fingers, I made it such a point to learn this song front to back, and when I finally mastered it I felt like the king of the cosmos. This really was Cliff's baby, you can tell. He was the lone theory nerd in the band, he was the guy who had his nose buried in books and came up with most of the out-there melodicisms. It was a popular thing for a while to say that Metallica never would've done what they did in the 90s if he was still alive but honestly he might've pushed them there even sooner. \"Orion\" was his, he was the one with all of the less heavy ideas, he was the one who insisted on injecting melody into heaviness, he was the one who was into R.E.M. at the same time as he and the rest of the guys were pounding brews to Motorhead. \"Orion\" is that marriage of jangly melodic bassiness blended with ripping palm mutes and screaming guitar solos that so encapsulated what Metallica was doing in 1986. Everything was distilled into itself on \"Orion\" and I still love this song as much in 2019 as I did whenever it was that I first heard it. That heavy \"verse\" riff that shows up a few times and carries out the heavy parts before the last fadeout is one of my favorite riffs of all time. That gallop is just fucking sublime.\n\nAll that said, Master of Puppets is not without its flaws, I'm not completely blinded by nostalgia here. The only real gripe I have with the album is \"Sanitarium\", which is, by a cosmic long shot, the shittiest \"fourth track ballad\" they produced in the classic run. I'd argue that \"The Day That Never Comes\" is the lone worse one if you stretch it to their whole career, but \"Fade to Black\", \"One\", and \"The Unforgiven\" utterly demolish it in every way. Hell even \"Until It Sleeps\", \"The Unforgiven II\", and the fuckin' Bob Seger cover on Garage Inc. completely trounce it. This, to me, is the one song that feels completely obligatory. It's like they were done with the album and then realized that their album formula required a ballad so they just ran back into the studio and banged one out in a half hour. It's just totally unengaging apart from the solid bridge (and even then it's only like one chord away from recycling the verse riff from the title track wholesale), it just feels like the band sleepwalked through this one. Whether you like the album or not, there's no denying that they weren't on autopilot for the other seven tracks. You can't tear through something as explosive as \"Battery\" or as groovy and infectious as \"Leper Messiah\" without actually trying, but \"Sanitarium\" is the one and only point where it really sounds like they weren't.\n\nI'm not sure if I've actually gotten my points across well here, and I might regret hitting the publish button as soon as I click it, but right now I just don't care. I love Master of Puppets, it was a super important album to me and I think it still easily holds up today now that I spend way more time listening to Dying Fetus and Pissgrave. I might've lost the plot a bit throughout this but I've gotten this far without bringing up the weird status this has gotten with the Extremely Online kids who went from noobs to know-it-alls within six months thanks to how easy it is to just stream music nowadays, but it's worth mentioning that this album doesn't deserve to be the battleground it's become. It's extremely popular because at the time this was the thrash album with the most reach and accessibility. Metallica opening for Ozzy in '86 gave them such a huge stage that this album has the distinction of selling over a million copies with no radio singles or music videos. This wasn't the heaviest thing in 1986, lest you all forget that one of my favorite albums of all time is Reign in Blood so don't think I'm being obtuse here, but it was one of the most accessible and easy to get into. And it's because of that relative safety of excellent songwriting coupled with frantically intense riffs and sheer aggression blended with just enough melody to catch ears and just enough extremity to be explosive without being alienating that likely millions of people even got into metal in the first place. I'm not saying that we should be extra nice to this album and not judge it on its own merits simply because it was important and released at the exact right time, but I am saying that if you willingly ignore context on a selective basis (like saying it doesn't matter that this opened so many doors for so many people but it does matter that Dark Angel was faster and heavier) then you should know that I probably think you're a vacuous dullard with little else to be proud of beyond your ego. Master of Puppets is an excellent record with a lot of ideas and most of them hit bullseye.\n\nThat's what matters to me.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nWhen people bought this album and dropped that needle on the record, ( or place the CD in the CD player or cassette in tape player. ) they heard a new form of metal which would later act as a major change to what we knew as heavy metal. That new form was known as thrash metal. Words can't describe how much this album has had an impact on heavy metal. This is what blew the minds of whoever bought and played this album for the first time. \n\nBack when this album dropped, glam rock ruled the charts when it came to rock and metal. Metallica obviously didn't give a shit what was popular at the time. They didn't give a shit about glam rock. This would appeal to those who were into less mainstream bands back before Metallica hit the mainstream in 1991. And I mean people who played this album right when it hit the shelves. \n\nAnalyzing the lyrics deeper than the average person who would listen to them, the lyrics talk about their personality and their lifestyle like with Hit The Lights and Motorbreath. These are lyrics of the lifestyle when they are in the band, which is hardcore concerts with people making a lot of noise for them when they come out and play their face-melting songs live. It just goes to show that metal isn't just noise like all these naive people say. If they just listen to the lyrics. It's much more than just heavy distorted guitars and screaming like they refer it to. With No Remorse, the lyrics sound like the band is about to fuck somebody up without feeling regret or sorrow for their actions. The same can go for Seek and Destroy too. As well as the themes of lifestyle and fighting, there's also the theme of rebellion in Metal Militia. This is the fuck authority and embrace metal song. This is basically saying live life in a non-conformity way. Basically saying don't give a shit what society expects of you. And there's also the hard-partying theme in Whiplash. And even religion in The Four Horseman.\n\nAside from lyrics. The instrumental work is fucking amazing. It's like what James Hetfield said in the song Phantom Lord. \" Sound is ripping through your ears, the deafening sound of metal nears. \" It's loud, fast, and it all builds the characteristics of what makes the greatest metal bands great aside from the lyrics. This is what kicked heavy metal into shape and this is what made metal what it is today. Hardcore instrumentals and great lyrics. You even get a bass solo from Cliff Burton on Anesthesia. Personally for me. The bass solo brought chills down my spine. This song, among many others persuaded me to pick up the bass guitar and start jamming out in my room. The tempo of the song and the complexity in solos and riffs shows the hard work and the dedication that the band put into this album. You can definitely tell that Kirk and James spent a lot of time playing guitar to get this good. And Cliff Burton even shows off the skill he has in the Anesthesia solo too. And we all got to admit. It takes hard work to play drums in a thrash metal band. As much as you all want to slam Lars Ulrich, you gotta take note of this.\n\nThe emotion put into this album is crazy. James Hetfield's delivery is absolutely insane. He makes you feel the mood of actually not giving a shit about society and living life the way you want to fucking live it. He makes you feel you have that freedom of choice to do whatever you want in life and he just gives you the energy to live life to the extreme. The songs like Seek and Destroy and No Remorse just makes you feel strong. Like you are ready to fuck someone up when that time comes when you gotta fight for your life. It just makes you feel free from society. This album actually makes me feel this way sometimes too. When I walk outside playing this, I feel like I'm living life like these rockstars. Others can relate too. You actually feel like you're one of them.\n\nNow that I analyzed the album nearly completely, I now understand the deep impact behind this record now. Back a few years ago, I headbanged to this album a lot. But I didn't completely understand the impact this album had on society. Until I analyzed this album. This album was the album that really encouraged people who didn't feel like fitting in with the big crowds to be themselves. Just live life the way you wanna live it. This album just straight up tells you not to give a shit. Live life the way you wanna live it. Don't give a shit about if people walk by you and frown upon the way you live life. Just fucking do it. That's the moral of this album. I would give a visual analysis of the album cover and talk about how great it is. But the purpose of this review was to talk about the MUSIC right? So that's all I got to say about this album.\n",
        "\nThe year was 1984. Just last year, Metallica had released an aggressively frantic piece of early thrash metal called Kill 'Em All, which had helped bring the genre up from the underground and into the metallic spotlight. Fans were expecting the band to deliver on more fronts and then some to create an even bigger and better slab of pummelling thrash for their second album, so it came as a surprise when the album begins with an acoustic guitar of all things. According to stories, some people just turned off the album right then and there in disgust. Those that did stick around, however, were rewarded after all. The acoustic intro to \"Fight Fire With Fire\" segues into one of the heaviest riffs the band has ever recorded and was most certainly worth the forty second beginning, because it makes that riff work far better than it would have without it.\n\nAnd yes, Metallica really did double-down on their approach to crafting metal, working harder not only on their heaviness, but also on their musicality. Ride the Lightning basically has it all - from the opener to the ballad to the nine minute instrumental, it flows well from song to song and there's enough variety on display to keep even those not so interested in the genre at attention. The band have streamlined their approach to writing hooks, which shows, because for all the heaviness on display here, it's pretty damn catchy at the same time.\n\nPerhaps the biggest improvement this album has over the debut is the production, which is arguably the best the band has ever had on any album. Some people have criticised Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets for sounding a little sterile, but personally speaking, I love it, particularly here. It sounds metallic in every sense of the word, but there's a mix of iciness at the same time which completely gets rid of the raw sound of the debut and replaces it with a slab of shining glory. The guitars sound fantastic on this release, and the bass and drums fit quite well in between them. James also has a much more controlled performance here which was lacking on the original. He's not perfect on every song, but he sounds way better as a whole and helps make a lot of the material work as well is it does.\n\nTo be fair, though, Ride the Lightning isn't quite a perfect album. There are moments here that don't quite work as well as they should. \"Trapped Under Ice\" is a solid song, but not as outstanding as it could be, \"Escape\" has a terrible bridge that mars an otherwise solid song, and even \"Fade To Black\" - as much as I like it - seems to fade out right when it's about to reach its peak. The slow build-down they utilise for live performances works much better for it, in my opinion.\n\nStill, there's too much good here that just looking at the negatives would manage to unworthily obscure. \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" is the best studio song Metallica have ever recorded, as far as I'm concerned, featuring some fantastic lyrics and an extraordinary performance from Cliff - who, by the way, is completely on point throughout the entire album. Just check out his driving basswork on \"The Call of Ktulu\", the epic instrumental that, alongside \"Creeping Death\", provides for an enthralling conclusion to the album. And then of course there's the title track, another great lyrical number with a fantastically memorable intro and outro that's helped it become a classic for a reason.\n\nWhen taken as a whole, Ride the Lightning is quite simply pretty great. Metallica never truly replicated an album's style again, and the one present here has never been seen on another album of theirs or on any other band's. It's a driving force as a whole, a truly deserving classic metal album that many would argue is their best work to date. I'd disagree - they'd use the same sort of structure set in place on Ride the Lightning and manage to somehow blow it out of the water on the very next album, Master of Puppets. Still, this one is worth coming back to a lot, because at the end of the day, it's a powerhouse of a release that helped bring the thrash genre and Metallica as a whole just another step forward in greatness.\n",
        "\nI've got some reservations currently in writing this review. For one thing, it's kind of weird to know that you like an album less than every reviewer before you. People think very highly of this album, and why shouldn't they? Hell, I think highly of this album. I've got a tremendous amount of respect for what Kill 'Em All was able to do. It was one of the first thrash albums many people heard, it put Metallica at the forefront of a brand-new subgenre of metal that was attempting to play heavier and faster than the bands they were inspired by, and there's a lot of youthful energy on display here that is quite infectious. This is an important album in metal's history, to say the least, and for that, I give it all the credit in the world.\n\nI just wish that it wasn't so boring.\n\nThe first reason for this, I've found, is that the album is simply too long for its own good. It's a little over fifty minutes in length and there's ten songs here, which seems kind of much for a debut album. If there was a little more variety on this record I could see it being viable. I love Master of Puppets, which has two songs less than this album, and yet eclipses Kill 'Em All in length by about three minutes. The difference, in my opinion, is that Master of Puppets is worth the length and this album isn't. All of the songs (with the exception of \"Anesthesia\") seem to be cut from the same sort of tree - raw, pumping, and rather frantic, without anything really interesting in the lyrics, which puts too much on the back of the music itself... and I really don't think most of the music is worth it.\n\nThe second issue for me is that the band's performances on the album aren't exactly stellar. Kirk would get better as a lead player with the next two albums, and Lars would become a better drummer in the years that followed as well. His performance on \"Jump in the Fire\", in particular, is lacking here. James's vocal performance is one of his worst, featuring way more shrieking than is necessary for the record. Cliff is pretty competent, but his only shining moment is on \"Anesthesia\", which is a pretty cool bass solo, although not exactly integral to the overall album.\n\nAnother issue I have with Kill 'Em All is the fact that the record is a bit front-loaded. The first three songs here - \"Hit the Lights\", \"The Four Horsemen\", and \"Motorbreath\" - are, quite honestly, pretty good for what they're trying to do. The first is a big, metallic opener that's a lot of fun, despite the weak lyrics and not quite perfect performance. The second is a classic Metallica song that remains one of their better tracks overall, comparing quite well to the rest of their discography. The third, meanwhile, remains their shortest song to date, which helps make it stand out, because it's quite a nice little ride overall.\n\nBasically everything else on here ranges from either \"okay\" to \"bland\". \"Whiplash\" and \"Phantom Lord\" would both benefit from Metallica reining themselves in and focusing on their strengths, rather than trying to be metal for metal's sake. There's a lot of action going on, but they don't quite pull the vibe they're going for off. \"Jump in the Fire\", meanwhile, is a sort of recapturing of \"Hit the Lights\" but without the charm.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest issue with this album is that some of these songs are just long for long's sake. \"The Four Horsemen\" is the longest track here, but it's also the best because it has a good balance of riffs running throughout to keep up with the listener. The same can't be said for \"No Remorse\" and \"Metal Militia\", the first of which never seems to get out of second gear and yet lasts for over six minutes, and the latter has a needlessly repetitive chorus on top of boring riffs that don't go anywhere. Maybe it's just me, but I've never been a fan of lyrics that shout about how \"metal\" one is, and that song really takes the cake in this regard. If the music was more interesting I'd be more inclined to overlook the lyrics, but they aren't, and the overall experience is all the worse for it.\n\nThe worst song on the record, however, is \"Seek & Destroy\", which illustrates quite clearly what I dislike most about the album. It's nearly seven minutes long and yet it plods on like it's never getting anywhere, features a needlessly repetitive chorus, and has some pretty fucking bland lyrics to boot. What really bugs me is how much better the song could've been. Just check out the live version from the Seattle '89 concert to see what I mean - that one is fun, gripping, and pretty great as a whole, because it provides an interactive bit between the band and the audience. Whenever I want to listen to this song, I seek out that version.\n\nThat's honestly probably Kill 'Em All's biggest flaw overall. In the right setting, these songs can be fun. They all work well live, when you just wanna \"rock out\" and have some fun. But when I actually sit down and listen to music, I want something that can engage me a bit differently, something that's a bit tighter and more defined than just something I can bang my head to, unless the songs really fucking rock. And I don't get that from this album. Obviously other people do, and like I've said before, it's an important milestone in the genre's history, but it's not something I like enough to come back to that often. Metallica have made far better albums than this, and the few good songs here aren't worth the time spent going through the full thing. It's a bloated and boring affair that ranks as one of the worst records the band has ever put together.\n",
        "\nMetallica may have faltered repeatedly in the studio, yet they should never be written off as a live band, not with the arsenal of classic anthems they have to draw from. Seeing these guys live should be exciting at the very least, because apart from the great material from the first 10 years of their career, one expects more than just four men playing instruments for a couple of hours. You know, some showmanship, some props. Some cunning stunts. Hence the title of this video, though I suppose they were trying to be rude as well. The two hour live set captures Metallica at a time when Jason Newsted was firmly established in the group, everyone had short hair, they were putting the finishing touches to ReLoad, and most people with access to media probably knew who they were. As a result, it's a big arena show that we watch, and you can bet that most things were done how Metallica wanted.\n\nAs for me, I've had a fairly ambivalent relationship with the biggest of the Big 4 bands, feeling that their first incarnation recorded good music that displayed the annoying habits of a few members, while I have little interest in most of the output after the first decade. Given that this show from Fort Worth, Texas slightly favours the older material, eight tracks of 20 coming from Load, ReLoad, and Garage Inc. combined, my interest is maintained fairly well. However, I will say this: I wouldn't have wanted to watch a two hour Metallica concert before 1996. Why? The reason for the success of Cunning Stunts is due to the band's ability to shift between high intensity songs and more relaxed, intimate moments that give the audience a chance to rest and connect with the music in a different way. Even though I'm not a fan of 'Hero of the Day' or 'Nothing Else Matters' under most circumstances, when Newsted sits down and finger picks his way gingerly into the latter song after the then-unreleased energy burst of 'Fuel', I sit down with him and begin following the music with greater avidity than before.\n\nTo some extent, that ability to change things up and refresh the gig can also be applied to the performance tactics as well. While logistically tricky, the stage in the middle of the arena (built more or less in the shape of the band's ninja star logo) allows the three string-players to move about and adopt different postures, each going into the audience on more than one occasion. Naturally, watching that on video isn't as interesting as slapping James Hetfield's hand from the front row, but it's still better than watching nothing at all. Lars Ulrich gets up from his drum stool more than once in the performance, taking his shirt off after just the second song, though he seems to get less camera time than the others, mostly because his mouth is open all the time while he's playing. Hetfield changing tops three times is amusing too. The stunt in question - in case you were wondering - is that at the end of 'Enter Sandman' during the encore, a fake stage invasion takes place and supposedly all the electricity shorts and goes out, leaving the band to play the final two songs with less lighting and clothing than before. Ulrich is in his boxer shorts by this point.\n\nRegarding my feelings as I watch through Cunning Stunts, I'm a bit torn between the things that I like and the things that Metallica clearly do well. In the first place, the quartet had certainly become very accomplished arena performers, Hetfield geeing up the audience with mindless call and response banter, plus several songs going into extended endings of cymbal and whammy bar abuse, particularly the end of the smoking rendition of 'Creeping Death'. On the other hand, Kirk Hammett's solos don't actually get much added to, which is a shame since I've always felt that his style limits Metallica from being explorative and taking risks. Basically, all these tricks are very effective, but I don't like them that much. Naturally, the best decision the band makes is in their choice of how to play the old material, allowing three Ride the Lightning songs to be played in full before cranking things up for a 14 minute medley of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning stuff. Right near the end, we get the abridged version of 'Master of Puppets' and a closing 'Motorbreath', both of which make the right choice regarding impact over pure nostalgia. Kicking off the show with their cover of 'So What', on the other hand, is fairly baffling.\n\nAs a concert video, I feel that Cunning Stunts falls somewhere between excellent and boring, largely depending on how you feel about big shows in general. For those who love the showmanship and rise and fall of an attention-grabbing production, I can't think of much else you'd want this side of a Rammstein gig (yes, we get fire with Metallica, but not that much fire), while the song choices are largely suitable for the style of show. Those who disdain the well-worn performance techniques aren't going to find much visually to occupy their time unless Ulrich running around in little shorts is your kind of thing. I'm also in two minds about whether I got my full dose of Metallica at their maximum, since the highlight is probably the second song in the setlist, 'Creeping Death'. Cherrypicking the most exciting parts of one of the most recognizable songs in metal also makes 'Master of Puppets' stand out. Therefore, I have to declare Cunning Stunts only a minor success, given that I wanted either a better show or a more innovative performance. I can't compare it to the other Metallica live videos, not having watched them, but I'd say this is a modestly diverting representation of where they stood in 1997.\n",
        "\nRight as metal (and thrash metal in particular) was about to begin its steady and still continuous decline, Metallica released what is arguably their most advanced and most well-written album of all time: 1988's ...and Justice for All, a vicious heap of near-progressive thrash that would permanently change the world of extreme music. Not only were they one of the very first post-1970s metal bands to show a legitimate stylistic shift, but the commercially successful \"One\" was a major point of entry, so to speak, for many young future metalheads. Not only does Justice present the most proficient instrumental performances of the three band members left after Cliff Burton's death, it also confronts real-world issues in its lyrics; even if they aren't exactly the most insightful, it shows that Metallica was aware of things outside of their trivial themes from earlier albums.\n\nThe amount of thought put into each song here is unparalleled by their other albums; each song is a delicate composition with dozens of intricacies in the form of attention to minor detail, such as variations and transitions. The result is an album that could just be Metallica's very best, a combination of typical thrash aggression with thoughtful songwriting. The preceding three albums have more of a fun feel, just like many of the earlier gimmicky records that frequented the discographies of pioneering thrash bands; Justice feels much more serious.\n\nThe lyrics address a political theme previously unexplored by Hetfield's lyrics, although they seem rather nondescript and don't exactly take a stance on anything; rather, they just describe rather cliche situations of corruption. In \"Dyers Eve\" and \"The Frayed Ends of Sanity,\" Hetfield once again tackles the subjects of mental illness and child abuse, which had already been covered on previous albums yet may be ever so slightly more insightful and authentic here.\n\nInstrumentally, this is easily Metallica's finest hour. Lars Ulrich, who infamously descended into mediocrity on the band's eponymous album three years later, somehow managed to give his best drum performance of all time throughout the album consistently. Lead guitarist and wah-pedal aficionado Kirk Hammett also lays off his blues scales for once and instead peppers his solos with divebombs and exotic scale runs that fit the music much better than the repetitive garbage he was accustomed to before. James Hetfield's rhythm tracks are tighter than ever. Newcomer bassist Jason Newsted notoriously is not to be heard anywhere on the record, but it isn't noticed until it's pointed out.\n\n...and Justice for All is Metallica's strongest and most inconsistent album by far, and that's not a record I expect them to beat anytime soon. Not only is it intense, but it reaches emotional moments (as throughout the quiet parts of \"One\") and even a couple of heart-wrenching ones, particularly the acoustic interlude halfway through the ten-minute instrumental \"To Live Is to Die,\" which was dedicated to late bassist Cliff Burton. With its outstanding song quality and complexity, Justice will surely be remembered for the duration of metal's reign as an absolute true classic.\n",
        "\nThe problem with this record is that it has an identity crisis. It doesn\u2019t know whether it wants to be hard rock like the S/T or melodic thrash metal like Master of Puppets. On the surface, it seems like a thrash metal record. There are cool thrash metal riffs in nearly every song and Hetfield's palm mute technique is of course top-notch. The problem here is that the cool riffs are always accompanied by generic, chugging verse-riffs, that don\u2019t do anything for the songs. These seem to be just an excuse for Hetfield to shout his lyrics, which have also changed from metal style to protest-rock. The whole album is actually dominated by Hetfield\u2019s vocals while the guitars just play along in the background. Some riffs are headbanging, but the constant vocal shout doesn\u2019t give them enough room to operate. The riffs slowly mutate into eachother and become just tapestry in the constant presence of Hetfield\u2019s shouting.\n\nThe record is mainly in mid-tempo with a few faster tracks thrown in to the mix, an idea which I like. Slayer succesfully dropped their tempo on South of Heaven and still maintained a very dark athmosphere. ...and Justice for All unfortunately doesn't succeed in maintaining anything on this record. The only constant on the album are the vocals and that shouldn't be the case on a metal album. The feeling your left with after listening to the record is that there was a very loud vocalist shouting over some mid-tempo, chugging riffs, which didn't differ from each other too much. \n\nThe best songs on the album are the ones that don\u2019t try too hard to be metal, like \u201dOne\u201d and \u201dHarvester of Sorrow\u201d. Harvester of Sorrow is a groovy, post-thrash anthem that flows very well compared to the other songs. \u201dOne\u201d slowly transforms from a rock ballad to a full-blown metal song in good coherence. The other songs just meander without meaning between some semi-cool thrash metal riffs and James screaming over the instruments. Lars' performance is also all over the place, when on the earlier albums he was very tight and on bar with the rest of the band.\n\nThe choruses are anthemic in a hard rock style, but they don't really belong here, in a thrash metal record. The big interludes are the one thing that really sounds metal, but they are out of place after 3-4 mins of hard rock riffing. The solos on the album are just without any idea. Metallica also tries to dress some generic chugging riffs up with weird time signatures, a style that could impress a newcomer, but definetely not a heavy metal veteran. \n\nThis album gave birth to a new generation of thrash metal bands like Pantera, Meshuggah and Machine Head, which had a larger appeal with their faux-aggression and rock attitude. ...and Justice for All was not a disaster as an album, but on the scale of Metallica, it marked a start of a slow decline from an excellent thrash metal group to a hard rock, heavy metal-lite one.\n",
        "\n(Please see my profile for my rating scale.)\n\nPerhaps this is in bad taste, but I can't help but start my review by putting it in context of other takes on Load on this site. Reading some of these other reviews, in particular the ones that tend to give it interesting scores like \"27%\" (how is that different from 20% or 30% or even 25%?), literally made me a little angry. And I don't usually get angry, at least not merely from reading someone's opinion of a piece of music. After all, tastes vary, right? No accounting for taste, right?\n\nRight. That's WHY some of these reviews bring up anger in me. I completely understand rejecting this album because its style is not Metallica's prior typical style; or because you prefer metal. In fact, I myself find the Load song Mama Said -- straight up acoustic country, twangy vocal delivery by Hetfield and all -- totally inappropriate for the album, the band, and this site. I fuckin' hate country and don't want to hear it on a Metallica album.\n\nSo, it's not that which brings up anger. It's when someone who hates the album's style still attempts to critique its content and then makes a bunch of assertions that are straight up false. A few examples -- which will hopefully help the reader also get a sense of the album (the ultimately point of any review) -- follow:\n\nJames Hetfield's voice is often criticized as being inferior to his singing on older records. One review notes that it might be a result of aging or something. Factually speaking, however, Hetfield on Load turns in BY FAR his best vocal performance to date. His voice is powerful, pitch-perfect, and most importantly extremely varied, expressive, and dynamic (compared to, say, the striking but quite static and unchanging vocal delivery of 1988's ...and Justice for All). It's an emotionally charged performance, and on a technical level it is without a doubt his best singing. It's not even close, really. His vocal technique here reaches its peak, culminating the journey started on the self-titled predecessor a.k.a. the Black Album. Yet reviewers will cite is as somehow inferior or technically lagging behind singing in the band's 80s thrash heyday? NO.\n\nAnother example is a criticism of the song structures and musicality. For example, the song Bleeding Me is often criticized as \"going nowhere.\" Look, I get it: it's not the harshest or heaviest song by a long shot, and maybe it's just not for you. But if you *actually* listen to it, you'll notice that the thing is a rare example of true dynamic through-composition by a mainstream metal band. It develops slowly but surely, into an epic climax punctuated by an outstanding Kirk solo and tortured vocal delivery by James -- until the relaxed denouement that circles back to the song's similarly subdued start. The dark, if deliciously opaque and full of allegory, lyrics are a credit to Hetfield as a lyricist, showing he can be personal and emotional without it coming off as cheesy or overly literal. If anything, Bleeding Me is the triumph of SONGWRITING over MUSICIANSHIP or GENRE. I don't mind criticism because you prefer blistering musicianship and metal-ness... but at least say so, instead of criticizing the songwriting as inferior, when the songwriting is precisely what positively lifts the damn track.\n\nYou get the idea. If you want metal, or god forbid thrash specifically, stay far away. However, if your tastes allow for mere hard rock, then throw away your Metallica preconceptions and enjoy.\n\nThe album fills the entire CD (73 minutes), and there is much for you to enjoy. There are a couple of thrashier numbers such as Ain't My Bitch and King Nothing -- I find them competent but actually a bit lacking due to the inevitable comparison to the Masters and Justices of the past; in such comparisons the past efforts win easily. No -- Load is actually strongest when it is most adventurous (Mama Said aside), going for the soft-hard-soft epic opus thing. The aforementioned Bleeding Me, the closer Outlaw Torn, and strangely vocal-focused single Hero Of The Day all stand out as some of Metallica's best SONGS (not performances; not displays of musicianship; but written SONGS).\n\nOther than the mentioned quasi-thrashers and heady epics, the album is rounded out by an abundance of 4-minute blues-riff-based mid-tempo numbers. (Ronnie, an extremely groovy song, almost sounds like it's by an evil ZZ Top... definitely strange to hear in context but undeniably well written and performed.) These songs are... good. They're not great, and while showing off James's fantastic singing, their very restrained mid-tempo/mid-length nature -- not enhanced by the same jammy adventurousness as something like Outlaw Torn -- can't help but somewhat pale in comparison to Metallica's best of the 80s. That is to say, back then, even the filler was pretty damned awesome, whereas here it's merely pretty good.\n\nThose, relatively speaking, filler songs probably also bear the brunt of the typical criticism as to Metallica's simplified musicianship during the Black Album-Load era. I can't disagree. Lars (or is it producer Bob Rock?) makes good drumming choices, but it's competent, really, nothing more. More sad is Kirk Hammett's recession into the background on this disc. AJFA (among others) shows he *can* really play, if he wants to, but he has to want to. Frankly, this album has very few solos -- and these 4-minute songs could very much use some variety that solos (or something lead guitar-oriented, at least) would bring. So Kirk is missed here. Frankly, he hasn't really been back since, at least as of 2018.\n\nThat said, ironically, Load also features arguably Kirk's best guitar solo of all time, which sits near the climax of Bleeding Me. It's Kirk all right -- all wah, all the way -- but like the rest of the song it's overloaded with emotion and pathos. Classic (if not necessarily the most blisteringly fast) work by Kirk.\n\nIn rating this album, I must consider its overall sound but also its consistency. Regarding the former, it sets out to accomplish a certain something and confidently succeeds at that something: an emotionally dynamic, vocals-oriented, blues-heavy hard rock album. However, in terms of consistency, Load suffers somewhat. Of its 14 tracks, I count 4 I skip every time, 3 classics or near-classics, and the rest are middle-of-the-road enjoyable. That's a very strong mix, but on the other hand it's no Justice or Master, which are swimming in all-time classics and feature almost no skip-it tracks.\n\n4/5 -- a very strong album and one of Metallica's top 5 albums, though not quite up to the standards of their thrash heyday.\n",
        "\nAfter the devastating loss of Cliff Burton, Metallica's bass guitarist auditioning ended with the young and hopeful Flotsam and Jetsam leader, Jason Newsted, becoming the fourth horseman. Little did he know of the abuse his bandmates would subject him to, kick starting the bittersweet story of a talented musician that never got the appreciation he deserved, except that one coming from the band's fanbase, who were much warmer towards him than his bandmates. But after the 1986 tragic accident, James, Kirk and Lars were pissed off, spiteful and saddened, and all that emotional discharge no only affected their new bandmate, but was also manifested on their fourth LP. Despite its obvious complex arrangements and long, winding compositions, something that usually ends up being overlooked is that \u2026and Justice for All is Metallica's darker album, its serious and poignant themes developed as a consequence of malcontent and trauma. \n\nJustice\u2026 a word that should have a stronger meaning in our lives. Unfortunately, corruption is a common human component, and even in the leading First World countries, it shows its ugly face more often than one would like to admit. In Metallica's US of A, it's no different of course, proved by so many popular culture examples from that country about cases of injustice that should shock us, but instead are every day's meal. \u2026and Justice for All contemplates and pinpoints this reality, especially in its towering nine-minute title-track, along with \u201cEye of the Beholder\u201d, which also deals with censorship, and \u201cShortest Straw\u201d, depicting the search for a scapegoat in staged judicial process. Other tracks focus on a more general degradation of the human morale, like the apocalyptic opener \u201cBlackened\u201d, or its pysche, like \u201cThe Frayed End of Sanity\u201d. And the two shorter pieces, \u201cHarvester of Sorrow\u201d and \u201cDyers Eve\u201d show more personal but equally mordant themes. As for the iconic \u201cOne\u201d, it's simply one of the greatest war-themed rock songs of all time, with an epic video to match its musical scope. \n\nJames sounds at his angriest ever, with more mature lyrics spitted forth with vile and conviction. In their preceding three works, when nefarious epic themes like the Horsemen of Apocalypse, the Plagues of Egypt or Lovecraftian horrors were touched upon, it sounded cool and fun, but the down to earth social themes of \u2026and Justice for All feel way grimmer and real. His rhythmic riff-work is almost unparalleled, powerful, memorable and downright pulverizing, as witnessed during the final crushing moments of \u201cOne\u201d or most part of the proto-groove metal \u201cHarvester of Sorrow\u201d. On his part, a pre-wah-wah obsessed Kirk shows his dexterity in the soloing department, and while he's never been that impressive in comparison to the top metal lead guitarists (like Tipton or Mustaine), he compensated with great vibe and a great sense of harmony. As for Lars, he also shows his greater chops ever here, his solid and precise upper playing enhanced with some bewildering footwork going on all the time, flashy polyrhythms and machine-gun bursts of double bass. \n\nThe perceived 'flawed' production values and the absence of bass guitar are well-documented \u2026and Justice for All characteristics, often criticized, both from a musical and a professional point of view. But if one checks out the \u2026and Justice for Jason version of the album in YouTube or other bass-enhanced underground mixes out there, one realizes that James' assertion that the bass mostly follows the guitar lines is actually true. Jason sadly wasn't given much room to provide input, so leaving him outside completely doesn't really hurt the record's sound. And after tenths of spins, it's quite impossible for me to imagine this with a different production, because for all its shortcomings, designed or unintentional, it does have a sound of its own. The dry drumming sound, with its clear and clicking kick drums, actually became influential for many bands that tried to replicate that aesthetic in the 90s and beyond. I'm still curious how Metallica's official remaster will sound like, but the original flavor of \u2026and Justice for All is fucking flawless to my ears. \n\nIn its massive 65 minutes, there's plenty to digest both thematically and musically. The band were extremely motivated to put up an even stronger, more complex album than Cliff's swansong, Master of Puppets, and to a degree, they succeeded, adding their visionary work to the class of '88, a year that saw many thrash metal bands reaching their most technical, progressive and ambitious heights yet, like Voivod, Deathrow and Coroner, as well as the advent of quality and similarly styled newcomers like Anacrusis, Blind Illusion, Realm or Pestilence (before they turned their attention to death metal 100%). The band's tribute to his fallen brother, \u201cTo Live Is to Die\u201d, shows their instrumental gusto at its best, with some mellow and melancholic guitar lines that really touch the soul. The use of acoustic guitars is excellent as well, complementing the hard-hitting side of the band with a lightened side. This classy chiaroscuro approach also featured on \u201cOne\u201d gives the record a more emotional impact, setting it apart from other tech thrash releases. \n\nIt's very easy to dismiss and criticize and album of this magnitude and musical ambition, given the stellar status of its creators, even back then, when they were still ascending through the upper echelons of metaldom and before their complete transformation into clich\u00e9d rock stars. But people tend to forget that Metallica were just a bunch of young musicians who had lived hell as a band, and after that fucked up turmoil they managed to come up strong and channel all that negativity into one of the undisputed highlights of 1988, and all-time thrash and technical metal masterpiece. Like everything Metallica did in the 80s, \u2026and Justice for All's influence and impact was and remains huge, and no matter how many subpar releases or polemic choices they make nowadays, nothing will ever erase this fact.\n",
        "\nSometimes a band will put out an album that, although not being bad by any means, will eventually appear lacking when compared to the rest of their discography. Sometimes a band will pull out an album that will just sound mediocre. Sometimes a band will pull out an album that is simply pretty bad. There are also some rare cases where a band pulls out an album that is a complete abortion, an horror that should be eradicated from existence, something that should have never happened in the first place. That is the case of Metallica's \"St. Anger\".\n\nI'll go straight to the point with this album. It sucks. It's just horrible, there isn't a single positive aspect worth mentioning about it, everything went bad. With this release, the band tried to go \"back to their roots\" while striving from them as far as possible: they tried to emulate the typical metalcore/nu metal sound that was so popular in the USA at the beginning of the 2000s, so they tuned down their guitars, they completely cut off the solos, they added breakdowns. The result is an album that tries to be as heavy as possible, but ends being just boring and uninspired.\n\nLet's start analyzing the lyrics. What the hell were they thinking to while writing them? \"My lifestyle determines my deathstyle\" (Frantic), \"I'm madly in anger with you\" (St. Anger). The list could go on, each song is a display of completely immature, generic, ridicule and cringy lyricism. It's impossible to take seriously something like this. What about James Hetfield's vocals? Well, this is surely his worst studio performance ever. He often just screams, trying to reach pitches he was never able to reach in the first place. He sounds coarse, like a chicken that's getting slaughtered. Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nKirk Hammett's performance is easily forgettable: as stated above, there are no solos, and the riffs are completely generic and uninteresting. Lars Ulrich's drumming is worse than ever, and the fact that the production is awful, the bass being lost in the mix, the guitars sounding lifeless, and the drums recalling a bunch of pots that's getting hammered, makes this disaster of an album even more unlistenable. Want to talk about the songs themselves? Well, they are unnecessarily long (the album closes at 75 minutes), repetitive, uninspired, and boring. This makes the whole CD drag a lot; are you getting the reason why everyone hates this album so much now?\n\n\"St. Anger\", as well as \"Lulu\", is one of those albums a band should never give birth to, something that should never have existed in the first place. It represents a big stain on the reputation of Metallica, something that later releases weren't able to completely delete. What else should I say? Stay the hell away from it, and don't waste your time and your money listening to this abortion.\n",
        "\nWow! Metallica, a band I would never have thought would collaborate with Mr. Lou 'Metal Machine Music' Reed. You know, the one that made a entire record full of noise and industrial music that even according to him scared away his fans? It's like blending different exotic fruits together to make a smoothie full of razors. Speaking of which, there is alot of reference to sadomasochism in these lyrics which I usually don't talk about in a review but Lou completely blew me away.\n\nThe album kicks off with a absolute banger, but this time it is a particularly frustrating one. Essentially it is a old man yelling slam poetry over some Metallica demos, but I will give Lou and Metallica some props for trying. As much as critics passionately shit all over this album, I think it is decent attempt to shock me and override any expectations for that 'new Metallica album'. The album has aged well, I see, with strong production and mastering but this should be expected from a Metallica LP.\n\nWith that being said, 'Pumping Blood' is easily my favorite track though for more pretentious reasons. I can actually see what Lou was going for here, his performance is completely overshadowing those heavily compressed and distorted guitars from Hetfield. But at the same time, it adds to the atmosphere of what exactly I was experiencing here. Confusion. All I can truly gather from this entire record is pure unfiltered disharmony and manic confusion. Like a surreal horror film played out over a art museum. A fucking monstrosity freak of nature pushing itself into the limelight that doesn't even know what itself is. \n\nSo because of that, I will give this album props for consistency and staying true to what it is: a experiment losing control of itself. But that's all it really is though, a bold in-your-face avant-garde piece that loves to be shocking and edgy like a teenage girl acting as a scene kid. Of course, that may sound like a insult but really that's what I am getting here at moments. I mean with lyrics from 'Brandenburg Gate', how could you exactly go wrong with this statement? \n\nI feel like this album is performance art masquerading as metal, like if I was reading some hipsterish liberal arts school drama class script and it was being audiovisually given to me as a means to convey some pretentious message to the youth or whatever. I can appreciate it, Lou Reed is giving us a real world image of what absolute batshit insanity looks like. You know, S&M and all sorts of perverse confusion like on 'Mistress Dread'? It's a shitshow, but a decent one at that. At least Lou Reed and Metallica aren't fooling you, but The View is still a terrible single and track composition-wise not conceptually because it ties together later into the LP. \n\nOverall I would say this record is really, really, fucked up beyond all recognition and still to this very day I will never understand why exactly these two knuckleheads would make a album together. Of course, I will not say this is a masterpiece because there are obvious flaws with this album but it's not complete shit. It's a fun ride that entertains and gives genuine emotion but doesn't fully leave a nice taste in your mouth afterwards.\n",
        "\nI like this album more than Master of Puppets. Also, I always thought the production was perfectly fine. What's that? What's the punchline? Oh, that wasn't a joke. If you're disappointed I hear James Corden is in your town soon.\n\nA peek into my adolescence: after I discovered iTunes (or more specifically I discovered megahertz decibel settings), more often than not I would listen to music with the preamp turned all the way up, as it would give it a massive bass boost without actually turning up the bass. Nine times out of ten this made the listening experience rule extra hard, but I never could crank the pre-amp with this one. The reason being that the bass frequencies were absurdly loud. Hell, the first time I listened to this album without looking up Metallica's history, I'd just assumed Justice was an example of the bass being really loud in the mix. So I would always take the rumors of there being no bass in this mix as a prank on me, rather than a hazing on Jason. Plus I've come to notice through a combination of my own listening experience and the excellent \"Metal with and without Bass\" series on youtube,\" when there isn't any actual bass being played. It's very subtle but if your brain registers it you'll feel there's something not quite wrong with the song. But when the bass starts being played your brain will register and the song will have properly \"kicked in.\" If you talk to Jason himself about it these days he'll rationalize it by saying his bass playing skill wasn't a tenth of James Hetfield's rhyhtm guitar playing skill (let's be real, it wasn't then and it wasn't now).\n\nSo, I never noticed any missing bass on this album. I also never found any issue with the album's guitar sound, the supposed clicky (or squeaky) bass drum of Lars. Never had a problem with this album's production. I never thought it was a pristine example of production, but I can think of supposed albums with \"atmospheric\" production that fail miserably and this supposed maligned album would be an improvement. With the exception of a noticeably maturity in Hetfield's singing, And Justice For All sounds like business as usual.\n\nMusically, I think Justice is a great record as well. It's earned its reputation as a genuine thrash record over these 30 plus years. A few of Hetfield's most beloved downstroke disasters frequent this record. Hell, there's even a nod to the New York/Kreator style thrash break in opener Blackened! The music gets less shit than the production, but to some fans this album is a reason the band died with Cliff. Ironically, tragic as his loss was, time has proven that the band didn't need Cliff. The fact that some nobody from second tier thrash band got the job ought to show that as talented as Cliff was, he wasn't Steve Digorigio, Steve Harris or Les Claypool caliber on the bass. Plus the so called \"progressive\" songs here, if you ask me to choose between these and their counterparts on Puppets, I'll likely pick the ones here. One over Sanitarium, Shortest Straw over Disposable Heroes, Blackened over Battery, and even To Live Is To Die over Orion. I don't know, maybe because I've developed a taste for doom/death recently, I've found that instrumental to scratch an emotional itch that Orion never could. Yes, I'm aware Cliff helped with this song as well, but his input seemed to be less involved, and I think it was a benefit.\n\nThe highlights of this album include the title track (an epic which I never thought was too long, and no I don't think it's a better song than Master of Puppets); The Shortest Straw, Blackened and Dyers Eve. Three of the nastiest ragers James came up with since Fight Fire With Fire (not silly acoustic intros either). That isn't necessarily a criticism of the slower songs either; I'm apparently the only person on earth who thinks Harvester of Sorrow is a good song and a damn fine live staple. I'm also apparently the only person who thinks The Frayed Ends of Sanity isn't the holy grail of Metallica's catalogue. Good tune, but overlong and who let the druids of Stonehenge into the booth?\n\nI wouldn't necessarily run out and grab this. Maybe wait a while after you've owned the first two (and a few other thrash staples) for a year or so. But don't be so quick to write it off just because you want to appear in some sort of fan-tier list either.\n",
        "\nWhat we have here is a collection of great songs that just happened to be faster and more jagged than anything else released in 1983. Yes we could snidely remark about Show No Mercy, but that was still a few months away. Not to mention that it would be dishonest to deny Metallica's (or at the least Dave Mustaine's) influence on the thrash scene.\n\nIt is fun to wonder how this album's reputation would hold up today if Metallica released nothing but it and then all promptly died in a bizarre gardening accident, but we don't live in that world. Love em or hate em, we more or less live in the metal world that Metallica built. As of this writing, Kill em All was recognized for achieving triple platinum in sales in 1999, and it didn't enter the Billboard charts until Metallica toured for Master of Puppets in 1986. But yes, for better or worse, we have, the first official thrash metal/speed thrash/power metal album ever. Yes there was a time when Metallica (and one or two other thrash bands, actually) were referred to as power metal. Read your Ian Christe, kids. Nonetheless, I'd say Kill em All has aged pretty damn well. I've heard some folks say it's aged the best out of all of Metallica's works due to a lack of overplay (strange considering it's the oldest work and that it would be prime for overplay).\n\nYou know, for all the shit that Lars gets as a drummer and as a human being, I truly cannot find any fault with his playing on this album (or any Metallica album really). Sure there are some unnecessary fills here and there, but a) what drummer hasn't done that, and b) I can think of at least two more respected by the underground bands who's drummers noticeably fall out of tempo in the middle of the song. This was 1983 on a Megaforce recording budget, I refuse to believe anyone involved in the making of this album had access to anything that could razor edit any instances of Lars loses time.\n\nThen of course we have the guitars, which, while unquestionably savage, tonally, doesn't quite measure up to the Great Wall of Ride The Lightning. Then again, nothing in metal does. James's amp-head getting stolen was the best thing to ever happen to thrash metal (just consider Fade To Black collateral damage). Trying to imagine those songs with Kill Em All's tone is like imagining a smaller breasted Kate Upton. Sure you could, but why? I'm also told Kirk's leads contain a few mistakes, especially considering he's translating them from Dave Mustaine, but this is one of those cases where the mistakes are just part of the charm, and I say that as someone who thinks that Dave is fret for fret a better guitar player than Kirk.\n\nBut the biggest reason that this album will forever stand the test of time are of course the songs. For all the yammering about how this brought the world to its needs, every single one of these songs are just that, songs with verses, choruses, melodies and goddammit, metal is the next logical successor to rock & roll. Quit trying to separate the two. The Four Horsemen, despite spilling Lynyrd Skynyrd into the Mechanix, has an absolutely brilliant guitar solo in its breakdown that if I'm not mistaken, was all Kirk's idea, and a real showcase of his talent (though for whatever reason he was never able to replicate it live. Wimp.) Hit The Lights and Metal Militia are two brilliantly vicious bookends that show the real reason Metallica was brought to the dance; pure unadulterated thrash. The former in particular, if this had the same execution as the original Metal Massacre recording or even the No Life Til Leather demo, it wouldn't have had the same effect. Don't go rushing into the studio to record kids. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. You're recording for posterity, not for shopping around, that's what demos are for. But my pick for best track is No Remorse, which is unconventional in all sorts of ways (starting off with a guitar solo, working at a mid-paced tempo for the first two-thirds of the song) yet not for one second will any punter think this is a weak or soft moment on the album. Violence begetting violence musically and lyrically, tis a wonderful thing when done right.\n\nKill Em All is one of two Metallica albums everyone should own, and arguably it's the one you should buy first. Metallica may go on to commit even more crimes against the mafia who made them, but Humphrey Bogart will always have Paris, and we'll always have Kill Em All.\n",
        "\nWhen I was in my sophomore year of high school, my Latin teacher had a laminated \"Master of Puppets\" poster hanging on her wall.\u00a0 She would always say it was \"the greatest Metallica album of all time.\"\u00a0 I, having not lost my virginity to heavy metal at the time, just rolled my eyes whenever she said that.\u00a0 It wasn't until second semester, after I had realized that the Def Leppard album I had been listening to for about a month (\"Pyromania\") was classified as heavy metal and after purchasing my first Black Sabbath album, \"Paranoia\" (which my stereotype-infested mind was surprised to hear a lack of screaming), when I decided to listen to \"Master of Puppets.\"\u00a0 It ended up being one of those albums that you sort of hold off listening to.\u00a0 You know what you're like \"Hey, I should listen to this album sometime\" and you never do?\u00a0 Yeah, I ended up purchasing \"Master of Puppets\" before listening to it.\u00a0 My first impression was \"Wow he's like screaming at me and stuff.\"\u00a0 It was the heaviest thing I had ever heard up to that point.\u00a0 I remember my dad walking into my room with a confused face.\u00a0 He was like \"What is this?\" and I was like \"'Tallica.\"\n\nI loved my newest addition to my small collection of classic rock CDs (later thrash metal collection, later blackened thrash metal collection, now death metal collection).\u00a0 I didn't even know what was going on.\u00a0 It sounded like a wall of aggression and noise slamming me in the face.\u00a0 Now I look back on it and laugh because, not only is it significantly less heavy than what I listen to now, it's also such a mediocre album.\n\nYes, that's right.\u00a0 It's not that great.\u00a0 There are four great songs on here, a couple of good songs, one bad song, and a shitty waste of eight minutes (aka \"Orion\").\u00a0 I guess one could say that it is my least favorite album out of Metallica's \"big four\" albums.\n\nThe album starts with \"Battery,\" one of the strongest songs on the album.\u00a0 It's thrashy, hard-hitting, and is a nice continuation of what was seen on their first two albums.\u00a0 This is nice because it's a good indicator that Metallica isn't losing their touch.\u00a0 But all touch is inevitably lost once the listener reaches \"The Thing that Should Not Be.\"\u00a0 This is the thing that should not be following up \"Master of Puppets,\" one of the best songs on here.\u00a0 It's basically six and a half minutes of boring mid-paced thrash without a solo (maybe I missed it; all the solos sound the same on here).\u00a0 This is the weakest song on here.\n\nThe structure of the album (as usual) is my biggest complaint.\u00a0 Metallica took their best songs and slapped them all on the A-side.\u00a0 What does that leave us with?\u00a0 A B-side of boring thrash and eight minutes of straight instrumentation.\u00a0 How dull does that sound?\u00a0 Okay, \"Disposable Heroes\" is a great track, there are some cool riffs near the end of \"Leper Messiah,\"\u00a0 and I do like the way they say \"Damage Incorporated\" on the final track, but none of it is good enough to redeem the entire second half of the album.\u00a0 Also, \"Damage, Inc\" is a good song until James starts singing.\u00a0 On every other track, James' vocals sound fine, but his vocals on this track, for whatever reason, kill the mood.\n\nI think they should have taken all of the riffs from \"Orion\" and put them on the three actual tracks on the B-side, and then have taken the riffs from those songs and put them on \"Orion\" because the riffs that are on \"Orion\" would be better served with vocals.\u00a0 To me, everything on the second half seems awkward and out of place, and, by the end of the album, the listener will forget the greatness heard in \"Disposable Heroes.\"\u00a0 They won't forget the greatness of \"Battery,\" \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium),\" or \"Master of Puppets.\"\u00a0 Those songs are too incredible to forget.\n\nIf you're going to listen to Metallica for the first time, this is a good place to start.\u00a0 Just make sure to check out their first two albums afterwards so you can find some thrash metal of a better quality.\n\nOverall Rating: 67%\n",
        "\nMetallica were metal titans in the early nineties. Thrash riffs over furious drums, screaming leads, and songs about metal, bible stories, killing, war, drugs, rocking out, The SYSTEM, and wandering about. Then after getting a taste of super-stardom they sold out hard, went for the cash and said screw integrity. Glittering prizes and endless compromises and all that. Actually...no. Metallica just grew up. James Hetfield was a deeply broken individual writing lyrics that I\u2019m sure didn\u2019t address what he felt inside. Yeah tunes about freedom and individuality were core to his being, but he had a lot of pain in there that he had been keeping in check with Coors Light and Jagermeister. Now that he had carte blanche to do whatever he wanted to with Metallica so he moved them in the direction of writing heavy music for emotionally devastated adults. For those people who feel no more than aimless generic rage or the desire to headbang until your neck is wrecked..well you are have been left behind to worship the past. Here his more personal songs structures and ideas were a perfect fit for Co-Leader Lars Ulrich\u2019s desire to simplify his drumming in order to cut back on the need to practice. Kirk Hammett, who was fully replacing his ego with a wah pedal, saw what was happening and went with it rather than argue. And Jason Newsted claims he was honestly happy to play on James\u2019 songs rather than the mountain of material that he submitted since James\u2019 stuff was better anyway. So into the studio with Bob Rock they went and out came the record that told the thrashers to piss off and invited the rest of us to experience the broken soul of one James Hetfield. \n\nThe songs tell of a journey from false bravado and swagger to a man having that stripped away to finally maybe finding that one person, that one piece that would make him work, that would fix him. You really need to listen to the whole thing to get it as it goes from boozy swagger to pain to tentative hope. \n\nUntil It Sleeps is the start of the true soul of this album Part one of a triumvirate of misery. The song is Hetfield praying for someone to help him, to hold him, to help him rebuild the wall that keeps the pain away, that keeps it sleeping. This song could also be about him running out of Coors light. I\u2019m sure those were intertwined. This selection is driven by the bassline and the vocals. Kind of a minimalist approach to songwriting, slightly progressive, slightly goth rock\u2019ish. Lars drums moving in the back but never taking over. Sparse guitarwork during the verses but coming out more as the angst builds during the lead up to what passes for the chorus. \n\nPart two of this core is Bleeding Me. A circular structure of a song, it ends up where it started just like Hetfield. Driven by a simple guitar and bass intertwining that makes it thick and compelling with some light guitar ringing out. The song talks about someone who knows they are fucked up and self destructive, yet is caught up on wheel of their own making that moves them around and around doing the same stuff since they never stop it. He knows he is reaping the only possible outcome of his own actions, yet he can\u2019t change himself. The song is the soundtrack of a broken man who can\u2019t hide it from himself anymore. Its closes strong with a final verse that says that \u201cyeah I\u2019m a damn mess but I know it and maybe I can change it one day...Hey is that a Coors in the back of the fridge?\u201d I could see this on Promised Land by Queensryche. \n\nArguably the highlight of the record is the ultimate song on the album and of the trilogy, The Outlaw Torn. A slow build up to a thick main riff. This is a free form lament hefted by the huge bass of Jason and the plodding drums of Lars. Hetfield\u2019s passion and pain are so clear from the vocal tracks, he isn\u2019t writing a story he\u2019s telling his story here as sings that maybe he found the what he was always waiting for, the person that can free him from his self imposed prison of pain, loss, and loathing. He\u2019s waited his whole lifetime for them. The one who can stop him when he beings to destroy himself. The rhythm guitars are perfect for this, thick and moving in perfect unison with Lars and Jason. Full of wonderful and emotional effects driven work, where others would have put some shreddy nonsense, all building up to a crescendo of powerful lead wah work. Then the song closes out with a jammy section that shows a glimmer of hope, maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel and its not a freight train coming his way. Maybe Mr. Hetfield can claw out of his pit after all.\n\nOverall there are a couple missteps, like Ronnie. An interesting piece of work that has no place on this record unfortunately. A pretty good song but should have been left off to avoid the jarring change in focus at that point in the experience. Some say the same about Mama Said but honestly this Waylon Hetfield number fits in where it does in the flow letting the user know part of the reason Hetfield is such a wreck. I think James and Jason should do a country record to be honest. \n\nMusically the band does not lay down tracks that feel like old Metallica outside a couple examples. King Nothing has single written all over it and would fit on the prior record easily. Guitars are often sparsely played and creating texture more than raging riffs. Even the faster more upbeat material is more percussive and thick than thrashy. Drums are reserved and minimalist, just enough to support the weight of the songs. He gets slammed but I think he does a very good job on this, a lot of double bass and frantic fills would not work. Kirk...well Kirk is Kirk. Wah is the name of the game here. But when it works it works well with strong solos on several songs and some nice effects work on tracks like the afore mentioned King Nothing. Beyond James the performance standout is Jason Newsted, sure he didn\u2019t get any credits but his bass carries much of this record. A very thick and driving tone is on display here. \n\nIn the end this is a new Metallica, no longer holding back their feelings that won\u2019t go over with the Manowar crowd. Hetfield is inviting you to journey though his fractured psyche and you should take his hand and step in. Its a more mature Metallica, one that realizes all the bluster and bravado and bad beer can\u2019t hide what is really happening inside. This is also the last great Metallica record so when your friends tell you this sucks and instead to listen to some new metal record with songs about robots taking over, the apocalypse, dying for metal, or other such fare just pat them on the head, put this on your headphones, and leave the children to their frolics.\n",
        "\nI myself have been guilty of saying that Metallica never put out anything good after 1988's massive, near-progressive thrash album ...And Justice for All. For the most part, that is true; almost every single album that followed it was a colossal failure in many ways. But by making such a bold claim, I and many other metalheads were denying respect to an album that for many of us was the entry point into the world of heavy music. I also suspect that many of the people who speak out against this album haven't given it a good listen in awhile, and view it in a negative way simply due to the fact that their memory portrays it as a successful attempt at a full commercial breakthrough.\n\nIf, at the age of eleven, I had never heard \"Enter Sandman\" on the local classic rock radio, I never would have gotten into Metallica or metal at all. I never would have become as dedicated a guitarist as I am now, and I certainly never would have formed metal bands or written almost five albums' worth of metal songs. If I had never bought this album as a whole, I never would have become an obsessed little Metallica brat before finally branching out and listening to Slipknot of all bands, and then growing up and discovering death metal. I know for a fact that a large fraction of the world's metalhead population has a similar story, much of it all because of this album. Other albums such as Paranoid, Blizzard of Ozz, and British Steel have similar reputations, but why is this one so much more hated than those?\n\nThere's a simple answer to that question: every song on this album is catchy, even if only barely decent in quality. While on previous albums Metallica had embraced a softer side with power ballads and such, they had always maintained a constant underlying thrash element that is for the most part lost on their self-titled album. The few faster-paced riffs that remain are just one or two notes total, such as in \"Holier Than Thou\" and \"The Struggle Within.\" The bass had made a comeback since the previous album, best exemplified in cheeseball anthem \"My Friend of Misery.\"\n\nNow, of course, this album is nowhere near perfection. Where are rapid-fire double bass drums and the insanely fast tremolo picking that Metallica fans had been so fond of? Although James Hetfield had grown out of his shrieky, throat-ripping vocals on Justice, the borderline laid-back delivery here simply does not satisfy. The use of acoustic guitars was increased greatly, taking up virtually one whole song in the needlessly boring and overrated \"Nothing Else Matters,\" and close to half of radio favorite \"The Unforgiven.\" When distorted guitars are present, their clarity has been touched up once and for all, giving most of the album a feel of exaggerated polishing.\n\nWhile not the greatest album ever, Metallica's eponymous release certainly is not the worst thing to disgrace the world of metal, or even the band's discography. The songs are all catchy, which somewhat makes up for what they lack in heaviness and classic feel. Even though the band was trying to make a break for the mainstream, that fact is the very reason it's such a crucial point of entry to the world of metal do this day. The lyrics aren't terrifying and the music isn't too complex for young listeners. The best songs are \"The God That Failed,\" \"Holier Than Thou,\" and the lifesaving \"Sad But True.\"\n",
        "\nJoining Metallica's Fifth Member Fan Club isn't difficult; you must be dedicated enough of a fan to go to their website and enter a bunch of revealing personal information, and additionally be a fanboy/girl/person at a mental age twelve years old at most. As a twelve-year-old fanboy, I fit the description and joined. I was soon pleasantly rewarded with this rare treasure, a compilation of previously unheard live tracks and useless remastered versions of classic songs such as \"Blitzkrieg.\"\n\nBesides the pointless rough mixes that just sound like the songs anyway, and the instrumental garage demo of \"Ride the Lightning,\" this sampler is made up almost exclusively of live tracks from 1983-5. These songs showcase Metallica's typical performance style of those days, and are pretty much the same as any classic-era concert you could find on YouTube. There's nothing spectacular about any of the live songs, really, since there's little variation from the way they sound on the albums. Probably the best part is James' stage banter, which at one point reveals that the band had just had their gear stolen and were performing with equipment borrowed from Anthrax.\n\nI don't know if this sampler is still available for download. If it is, and you're already a member of the fan club, I guess it could be worth a quick download, just for fun. Otherwise, I think it would be a waste of time to join the fan club just to get a free-yet-useless sampler with virtually nothing exciting about it. If it's no longer available, you ain't missin' nothin'.\n",
        "\nI was at this concert on August 20th, 2016, and I remember it well. I was a 13-year-old, and I considered myself to be a \"metalhead,\" although Amon Amarth was the heaviest thing I'd ever heard and I found Chuck Schuldiner to be unbearable to listen to. Given the fact that this was the first rock concert at U.S. Bank Stadium and that the local newspapers were raving about the show the next day (calling it the \"loudest concert of the year\"), one might infer that the boys in Metallica had really outdone themselves this time, putting on a rare classic-style concert. This was not the case.\n\nAt the time, I thought this concert was about the greatest thing ever. That being said, I'd only ever attended one other metal show, Sabbath when they came through on their farewell tour. I had yet to witness Amon Amarth, Opeth, Gojira, and Fuckin' Slayer live; so the basis for my enjoyment was somewhat limited. But I went as it was. So, having paid my $150 (mostly in small bills and quarters) for a seat, I attended the show seated a mere four feet from former metal aficionado and ex-Crimson Thorn lead guitarist Paul Jongeward, whose son I was BFFs with. We all found Avenged Sevenfold's opening performance to be quite disappointing, but that's irrelevant and to be expected.\n\nAfter a sound check that shook the whole stadium, Metallica finally emerged with the thundering opening riffs of \"Creeping Death.\" This song saw Hetfield delivering one of his rare, coveted near-gutturals of yore, one of a few that would be heard throughout the two-hour show. Going straight into \"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\" everything was fine and dandy; just as metal as could be. I was even happy when they played \"Fuel\" next. But then... what the hell? They followed it immediately with two more songs from the dreaded Load and Reload era. After having been a Metallica for more than two years, I finally understood why people always accused the band of having sold out. Here they were, playing a sold-out show at a brand new football stadium in a state they hadn't played in for almost a decade, and they were playing three songs from a couple their most despised albums right at the beginning of the show? Absolutely disgraceful.\n\nAt this point, my friend had a temper tantrum and descended to the food court, where he remained until this streak was over and they redeemed themselves with... \"The Unforgiven.\" Not exactly a strong comeback. Then they played \"Leper Messiah,\" which had been elected by people who probably weren't coming to the show via a poll on the band's website. I wasn't happy about this pick in the first place (I had personally voted for \"The Four Horsemen\"), but then the whole band forgot to play the bridge and had to play it separately later on, after they'd realized their mistake.\n\nI'd seen Metallica live videos before, and I thought the shows looked awesome. I had seen an (official) full-concert video of a show a few months earlier, and I'd seen Lars Ulrich supposedly pass out on his drum set at the end of \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium),\" but I'd always assumed it was legit; Hetfield and Trujillo looked concerned enough on camera to be genuinely worried about the drummer. However, Ulrich did the exact same thing at the exact same place; and I realized I'd paid all that money to see an acted performance, not a from-the-heart concert.\n\nThe concert continued uneventfully in the usual form. \"Master of Puppets\" was placed smack dab in the middle of the show, not used as an encore like I had hoped. They closed their set very well with \"Seek & Destroy.\" Then, the encore happened.\n\nMetallica started their encore with \"Hardwired\" to much excitement, since the song had been released only two days prior and this was the first time it had ever been performed. The rest was completely boring, though. They played their Thin Lizzy cover, then \"Nothing Else Matters\" (which is better suited to be in the second half of the regular set, if you ask me), and finally the most obvious pick ever, \"Enter Sandman.\"\n\nWhen the concert was over, I was very happy with the experience. It wasn't until about a week later that I really had a chance to think about all the negative aspects of the performance. Ulrich's sloppy playing was at the top of that list, as well as the over-polished performance routine and the abundance of songs from The Black Album and it's two successors. While I would totally go see Metallica if they were playing only classics or if I could miraculously time-travel back to see a previous incarnation, I am mostly unsatisfied with the experience of this concert and I would not recommend a Metallica show to any old-school fan or serious metalhead now.\n",
        "\nWhen one talks about the greatest metal album of all time, thousands of albums will make lists but less than a handful will end up on the top spot consistently. Over the years I've narrowed it down to four: Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast, Black Sabbath's Paranoid, Slayer's Reign In Blood, and the subject at hand, Metallica's Master of Puppets. The respective reasons for these albums are usually, the star arrival of Bruce Dickinson and Steve Harris' most enduring and popular collection of songs, Paranoid had the hit single in the title song as wellas the catchiest riff ever in Iron Man (can you think of any other reason why the s/t is less popular?), Slayer arguably did what Metallica should have been doing, setting new standards in brutality, and this album....sold a million copies in a year without a video or radio play?\n\nI'd like to think that one reason this album withstood contemporary criticism because the underground metal public's reaction was \"But dude, it's Metallica! They're the generals in the fight against posers and hair metal!\" The smarter fans should have taken a que from the Anti-Nowhere League and responded \"So fucking what?\" In addition, a much more cynical mind can clearly see that this album was a very safe remake of the Ride The Lightning, to the point where each Master of Puppets track can practically be substituted for it's predecessor's counterpart. Side 1 of the album follows this to a tee. The second half is not quite as easy to pin down, likely on account of Lars's scheming, best to presume Disposable Heroes as this album's Creeping Death and Damage Inc. as this album's Trapped Under Ice.\n\nSome say Metallica stuck to the formula in order to refine/perfect it. I disagree. The musical inconsistencies that I pointed out are proof that this was a copy and paste job but with very little thought put into it. Perfecting the formula means starting off Battery and Damage Inc. fast and thrashy. Not to mention the acoustic intro to Battery has no ties to the song's lyrical themes. At least Fight Fire With Fire was painting the picture of an ordinary day before the nuclear apocalypse. Perfecting the formula means finding a more appropriately universal topic for your apparently now obligatory ballad. Not too many folks know what it's like to be locked in a madhouse. Perfecting the formula means not fading out an 8 instrumental because you couldn't figure out an ending in time. Perfecting the formula means accepting customer criticism and applying it. In other words: if your fans tell you to cut out the slow shit and play faster, cut out the slow shit and play faster, or at least tell your lead singer to expand his range so he can try and sound like Ian Gillan. Fans may not know what they want, but they know damn sure what they don't want. If you are going to essentially put out the same album, you need to work within those boundaries of \"what narrow minded thrashers DON'T want.\"\n\nIn addition to the writing style, the production and overall band's sound is practically identical to Ride The Lightning as well. The only difference is the guitar tone feels slightly chunkier, the notes don't quite have the ringing/atmospheric feeling they did on the previous album. I'm not a guitar player so I'm not entirely sure if that is because of an increase in palm muted riffs on Puppets. Bass and drums feel about the same, although a nifty piece of trivia is that the snare drum used for this is none other than the snare of soon to be one armed drummer Rick Allen. Overall I consider the production and sound very good, but slightly inferior to Ride The Lightning.\n\nStill, I do think there are great songs here, and not just the fast songs either. The title track is every bit of a classic as its been made to be over the years, and unlike many others who are critical of this album, I don't think there's a single wasted second on the entire track. I feel like cutting out the final verse and chorus that so many want would have hurt the song's story rather than helped. Plus, ok, maybe that breakdown wasn't the first time a metal band (or a thrash band) suddenly switched atmospheres, but I believe the harmonies and James' solo are very high caliber. I also absolutely adore The Thing That Should Not Be and Leper Messiah. Yes, both the fast and the slow sections. Yes the middle break is the best part of the song, but you show me a version of Stairway To Heaven and Comfortably Numb without their guitar solos and I'll show you backwash turkeys that wouldn't be good enough for B-sides.\n\nThe only song I've never really cared for that much is Orion. Even back as a fanboy in high-school that loved Load & Reload, I would always skip this to get to Damage Inc. Years later, I understand the mood it's trying to accomplish, but its just too subdued, and the track is damn sure no Call of Ktulu. Even the following album's instrumental, To Live Is To Die has more entertainment value and a stronger emotional core than Orion. Matter of fact you could apply that comparison to And Justice for All as a whole.\n\nI'm a little hesitant to recommend this given its reputation. It's a lot like Star Wars, great entertainment, but not something you should study academically if you want to understand metal and thrash. Proceed with caution.\n",
        "\nHere we have an example of the omnipresent intangible. That invisible extra member, that \u201cit\u201d, that keeps the legacy of a creation alive despite all odds and factors, even the members who created it doing everything in their power to escape the genre who made them.\n\nThere is a definite \u201c80\u2019s\u201d sound to Ride The Lightning. The reverb, the guitar tone, the lyrical subject matter definitely screams that decade. But it doesn\u2019t represent a part of a decade where a bunch of trendy floosies look at themselves and feel embarrassed years later. It represents a place and moment in space and time respectively where despite reaching your finest hour, the sky is still the limit. The album cover reinforces it. Yes there is that electric chair, but the most compelling thing my eyes are drawn to is the dark blue cloudy area of space. Letting you know that no matter what direction you travel in, you will never be lost from the path of righteousness The album is almost frozen in time, yet still completely able to react to the world around it. And that guitar tone, my God. If anything fucking screams metal in this Babymetal face-paint meathead mall infested world, it was whatever settings were dialed into that amphead at that fateful recording studio in Denmark. Everything about this guitar tone is the very definition of metal. Crunch, thickness, clarity of notes; I know probably a total 1% of guitar language and I could bet my possessions I could talk whatever guitar wizard into thinking that this tone is more metal than whatever he considers the most metal tone. But shit what else would you expect from a band calling themselves Metallica?\n\nOf course there is the matter of the slower songs. Fade To Black is a great song, and a perfect encapsulation of the helplessness and hopelessness of depression. I just feel like Lars constantly using it as a justification on 30 plus years of corporate cock-sucking bullshit has practically ruined it. It's almost like he's daring us to find a time machine to go back and kill 'em all to prevent things from getting any worse. Plus in a sense, the song is a failure. Lars would constantly reference songs like Child In Time and Beyond the Realms of Death as justification that ballads were ok in metal but the difference is those songs had brilliant screaming vocal performances from Ian Gillan and Rob Halford. You need a vocalist or a melodic instrument that can properly convey that emotion and James Hetfield just never had it; not then, not in the 90s with his second-rate Waylon Jennings and Phil Lynott impersonations, and certainly not now. The single reason why this song (and most other Metallica \"ballads\") have worked was Kirk Hammett's lead guitar playing. Kirk catches a lot of shit, some of it being deserved. Credit to a previous reviewer for noting him using the same descending scales lick twice on the same album. But in my estimation, he was the most emotionally accomplished musician of the whole band. Yes, that includes Cliff.\n\nDespite some irregularities, unlike most Metallica albums after this, Ride The Lightning is still very much a thrash album. Even to this day I can't see it being any lower than third or fourth place on a greatest thrash albums of all time list. Fight Fire With Fire alone, here is where I will concede that Metallica were ahead of their time, in that this song, with all its fury and power is a harbinger of death metal. Even if this album fulfilled the dreams of these supposed strawmen thrashers that Lars likes to conjure up, and delivered 8 songs exactly like Fight Fire With Fire, I feel like most listeners would just replay the first track over and over again. I'm not sure Metallica was capable of topping this song, hell I'm not entirely sure any band ever did. That being said, having Ride The Lightning's glorious Maiden-esque intro come crashing in before the listener has a chance to locate the skip button was the smartest decision made for this album, particularly for listeners who focus more on songs rather than taking in the entire album as an experience.\n\nStanding the test of time is a phrase hacks love to use to disguise the fact that a mega-million industrial complex has managed to live longer than a flash in the pan cycle (Britney Spears anyone?). But Ride The Lightning actually does stand the test of time. Better than any other Metallica album, and better than most metal albums period. To paraphrase a Sam Cooke slogan, \u201cRide The Lightning is yours, it\u2019ll never grow old.\u201d\n\nRecommended Songs:\n\nFight Fire With Fire\nRide The Lightning\nFade To Black\nCreeping Death\n",
        "\nMaking a 27-song cover album is a bad idea for any bad; but it was an especially poor choice for Metallica, who were already at the low point of their career. Having just released the perpetually disappointing Load and Reload just a couple short years earlier, and half a decade before releasing their nadir album St. Anger, Metallica was like \"hey, all our fans hate us so let's do some covers!\" While maybe it could have been pulled off successfully, the result was extremely disappointing.\n\nWhile most of this album has Metallica's classic Justice-era sound (plus bass) throughout, it's really not that big of a deal considering that they wrote 0% of the material on it. To cover classic metal and punk songs in the grungy alt-rock style of their preceding albums would have been to prove themselves as sellouts. So instead, they took a collection of covers they had already released, recorded a handful more, and then bundled it all up and disguised it as an album. Some of the covers, of course, are classics, such as \"Blitzkrieg\" and \"Am I Evil?\" and the whole Garage Days Re-Revisited EP, all of which is inserted in the dead center of the album. But much of it, such as their cover of Blue \u00d6yster Cult's \"Astronomy,\" Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Tuesday's Gone,\" and Black Sabbath's \"Sabbra Cadabra\" fail to inspire. The rare standout is a slightly touching version of Bob Seger's \"Turn the Page,\" but replacing the emotional horns section of the original with Kirk Hammett's repetitive lead guitar nonsense didn't really help the song much.\n\nAs I sort of mentioned before, a lot of the covers on here were originally non-metal, meaning this album could be partly responsible for the modern craze of turning every song imaginable into a metal song. Besides the oddball classic rock covers on here, there's plenty of punk, including bands like The Misfits and Discharge. However, all these songs are ruined by James Hetfield, who seems incapable of doing any style of vocals besides his usually high-pitched yelling.\n\nMeh. This album is barely decent at best. Providing the listener with mediocre covers, this could only be enjoyed by someone who had never heard any of the originals or who is a complete metal novice and just wants to buy every Metallica album (so my 11-year old self). Most of the songs on here are a poor imitation of the original. This album is probably not worth a listen all the way through, since it's over two hours long. It's probably best summed up in Hetfield's failure to properly express emotion in their cover of Thin Lizzy's \"Whiskey in the Jar.\" But it sure as hell is better than St. Anger.\n",
        "\nMaster of Puppets is probably at this point remembered less as a music recording than as a cultural institution, a collective memory among white Gen Xers, disaffected teenagers then and 45-year-old dads with \u201ccrossover utility vehicles\u201d and mortgages now, and, thus disconnected from the historical and musical context it originated from, it became perhaps the most overblown, overhyped, and overrated album of the entire 1980s. If you are to believe the cultural narrative surrounding the possibly billion-dollar gravy train that is Metallica, that they invented thrash metal and that this album was some kind of massive leap forward in sophistication for heavy metal. Anthrax guitarist/bandleader Scott Ian, who really should know better considering he was there at the time, talked about Metallica having \u201ctaken Beethoven pills or something\u201d in a recent article.\n\nNever mind that Metallica were just a part of a musical movement that emerged organically in both the US and Europe in the early 1980s, itself the inexorable confluence of other heavy music genres that were already well established by the time Metallica got started in 1981; never mind that bands like Manilla Road, Queensryche, Fates Warning and Watchtower had already been pursuing aggressive yet complex \u201cthinking man\u2019s metal\u201d for years before this album came out and doing it better; never mind the incredibly limited musical vocabulary of this music (none of which even remotely resembles anything Beethoven wrote or would have considered writing); never mind that their cast-off lead guitarist Dave Mustaine\u2019s band Megadeth wrote better songs, played faster, and worked harder at every turn up until the middle 1990s. Metallica got to the top by selling the impression of taking their fundamentally simplistic blues-based music to a higher compositional plane, but unlike albums like The Spectre Within or Energetic Disassembly, Master of Puppets (and its successor ...And Justice For All, although that one was slightly more adventurous) wouldn\u2019t challenge the expectations of rock listeners or introduce any truly novel ideas. If you\u2019ve heard a decent amount of hard rock music written between 1970 and 1990, even if you\u2019ve heard nothing besides that before in your entire life, you will \u201cget\u201d Master of Puppets straight away.\n\nThe white American rock audience are probably the most incurious audience of music listeners in the world, so it\u2019s no surprise Master of Puppets made Metallica superstars, as what Metallica were selling, perhaps even from day one, was thrash metal rock music that eliminated things that could challenge or alienate Joe Middle America, a heavy metal Elvis Presley in the worst possible sense. In lieu of the terrifying irrational chaos of Slayer, the toweringly complicated rhythmic architectures of Watchtower, the virtuosic showmanship of Megadeth, or the relentless hammering brutality of Kreator, Metallica had comfortably familiar blues-rock scales and riffs and the sheer energy of four alienated, genuinely pissed-off teenagers. But by 1985 Metallica weren\u2019t teenagers anymore, and their real-world troubles had dissolved in torrents of money, attention, and alcohol as they now lived full-time in the fucked-up, ass-backwards anti-reality of show business. Another \u201cWhiplash\u201d or \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d wasn\u2019t going to happen, and Slayer and the Germans had them massively outgunned both in terms of both sonic violence and musical ingenuity. So in come the blues rock licks, and some jam band noodling when they want to calm things down a bit, because Uncle Ron\u2019s jazz and classical records were so boring so they never absorbed any of it (and, thus, neither could they absorb Rainbow or Fates Warning), and their mothers didn\u2019t let them listen to \u201curban\u201d music. The mediocrity of Metallica resonated with the mediocrity of white America and made them one of the most powerful cultural forces of the end of the 20th century (at least until the rise of Nirvana, an even more quintessential white mediocrity band, in whose orbit mainstream rock trends revolve to this day).\n\nThe mediocrity extends to the performers themselves. Much has been written, of course, about Lars Ulrich\u2019s numerous shortcomings as a drummer, but a lot of those issue arose in the \u201890s and his performance here is quite competent, if not very imaginative and peppered with gratuitous, awkward fills. It\u2019s Kirk Hammett who is the worst performer here\u2014a shreddy, noodly nonentity who plays pentatonic scales and blues licks fast, but not that fast, and sometimes he trips over himself, botching runs and including clams that sound horrible against the underlying chords. Sometimes he uses the wah-wah pedal to conceal a sloppy ornament or inject artificial pathos into his solos, a habit that would get worse in later albums. His solos worked, more or less, on their first two albums, both because his simplistic \u201cME ANGRY\u201d shredding bursts worked with the youthful, punkish rage of the music instead of against it, and also because many of the solos were written by Dave Mustaine and he was just doing his own take on Mustaine\u2019s originals, but his playing is woefully inadequate for an album with calm melodic interludes and eight-minute songs.\n\nCliff Burton\u2019s talent is nearly as overrated as Metallica itself, Burton having ascended after his untimely death to the pantheon of bass gods having done little, if anything, to justify being put in the same company as Bootsy Collins, Stanley Clarke, Steve DiGiorgio, or even second-tier godlings like Chris Squire or Markus Grosskopf. He was a quite adequate root hammerer, but adequate was all he was at the bass\u2019s central job of holding down the rhythmic foundation, when he wasn\u2019t abdicating it entirely to James Hetfield\u2019s curiously bass-like palm muting technique. His (extremely rare) solos don\u2019t have the sort of dual function of rhythm and melody great bass solos usually have, and instead are essentially guitar solos transposed down an octave for the bass. Since he was playing licks and melodies written to sound good on an instrument of a completely different register, timbre, agility, and character from his own, these solos sound extremely forced and don\u2019t complement any of the music around them. Contrast his playing to the subtle yet devilishly intricate combined counterpoint and rhythm David Ellefson plays on Megadeth\u2019s Peace Sells (also from 1986) and Ellefson\u2019s superiority is obvious. Burton did have much better lead phrasing than Hammett and knew a few classical melodic ideas but as Hetfield and Ulrich were writing the vast majority of the music and Burton was rarely even audible, very few of them were used well.\n\nSo it fell to James Hetfield, raised on bourbon-soaked hard rock, punk, and crusty old British metal albums that were ancient history by the time the recording sessions came along, to do most of the heavy lifting. His speed, stamina, and precision really were quite formidable, especially live, but he had and still has a very limited musical understanding and imagination, and his interesting melodies were mostly used up writing the first two albums. His trademark chugga-chugga jackhammer pattern that is now the most well-worn clich\u00e9 in the heavy metal songwriting toolkit gets much more insistent and repetitive in this album, to the point where it gets outright annoying, especially in the directionless riff salad of \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d. Hetfield, as usual, also handles the singing and it...exists; it\u2019s a very plain, vaguely melodic shout that you\u2019re not likely to embarrass yourself too much trying to imitate at karaoke night, lacking both the feral screeching aggression of his singing on the first two albums and the gravitas and genuine melodicism of the next two.\n\nBut, if you\u2019re a sheltered Middle American white kid raised entirely on your parents\u2019 rock music, it sure looks like an advance in sophistication. Metallica have eight-minute songs! There\u2019s an instrumental! But because it\u2019s not really that complex or harsh or dissonant, it didn\u2019t push such kids out of their comfort zone like genuinely advanced metal bands of the era. And sure, this album did lead many of them to explore heavy metal (and other musical genres) more deeply, but just as many were happy to have Metallica as an easier-to-swallow substitute. Metallica were safe; they didn\u2019t have any alien chromatic solos or confusing counterpoint or deliberate dissonance or truly breakneck tempos or belting high-pitched singing that could make a virulently homophobic \u201880s boy insecure about both his sexuality and his singing talents, and led to a flood of other watered-down albums that were like it but managed to be worse by being an imitation of put-on heavy metal rather than the actual put-on.\n\nThe lyrics on this album try to delve into weightier, more real-world-relevant topics with songs discussing drug addiction (\u201cBattery\u201d and \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d), the inhumane treatment of the mentally ill by society (\u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d), anti-war themes (\u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d, which says absolutely nothing \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d hadn\u2019t said on the previous album), and the \u201880s metal standard anti-televangelist rant (\u201cLeper Messiah\u201d\u2014what did leprosy sufferers ever do to deserve being compared to Creflo Dollar?) but all of them fail at adequately handling their subject matter. First of all, this is Metallica, and everything Metallica does is mixed with constant vainglorious, macho swaggering, so a song like \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d is perpetually confused about whether it\u2019s about how insidious drug addiction is or how badass Metallica are\u2014you always get the feeling that like Donald Trump, the only thing Metallica really want to talk about is themselves. \u201cSanitarium\u201d is particularly dreadful\u2014nobody in Metallica has a goddamn clue what mental illness is like, and even if they did their money would shelter them from any institutional abuses, and the whiny, petulant refrain of \u201cjust leave me alone\u201d sounds like James Hetfield talking back to his mother after being told to clean his room instead of an assertion of his humanity in the face of authorities vested with the power to incarcerate him, drug him, and surgically mutilate his brain. From this unconvincing sullen dreariness, the song then takes a complete about-face and is suddenly an equally unconvincing anthem about how the patients are going to overpower the staff (with what weapons?) and escape, because of course Metallica would never submit to the directives of a mental institution (yes, yes they would, if their childish meltdowns in front of their overpaid kiss-ass counselor in 2004\u2019s melodramatic \u201cdocumentary\u201d Some Kind of Monster are any indication). In light of this yawning intellectual void it\u2019s no surprise that the least objectionable lyrics are those to \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d (Cthulhu is really scary, booga-booga-booga) and \u201cDamage Inc.\u201d (literally just Metallica bragging about themselves for five minutes), where they forego any attempt at putting on sophisticated airs and just let their troglodytic macho-man schtick run free. Turn off your brain, throw up the horns, forget that you could be listening to something better instead.\n\nI purchased this album on vinyl from Metallica\u2019s own new record label Blackened Recordings, supposedly an independent company owned by the band themselves, but my hopes that a self-financed and self-owned label might treat the music recording with more respect than the multi-headed corporate Hydra of Warner Music Group did, but this has got one of those awful, lazy remasters that have been standard issue with every reissue of an old recording since around 1997\u2014intrusive punched-up kick drums and a heaping helping of dynamic range compression to bury all the fine details of the original mix in noise, because it sounds \u201cbetter\u201d on $12 gas-station earbuds. As usual with heavily compressed metal albums, it sounds worse the heavier it gets, and only in the quiet sections do you get an impression of the original mix, which was pretty good by Atlantic\u2019s low standards, but not great, very clear and with plenty of space between the instruments, but with a weak bass and muddy, uncontrolled snare drum reverb.\n\n\u201cBattery\u201d starts the record off with essentially a rehash of Ride the Lightning\u2019s opener \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d with new riffs, but the pace is about 50 beats per minute short of the original and the musicians\u2019 playing is far more relaxed, and it comes off as more of an angry uptempo boogie than a raging thrasher. The dainty acoustic intro thing had been a bit of amusing irony to juxtapose against the nihilistic, apocalyptic frenzy of \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d, but \u201cBattery\u201d tries it again, and this time it\u2019s a complete waste of time. When the thrash riffs finally take over, it\u2019s less a shock to the system than a relief that a transparent attempt to dress up this song as something it is not is over. The riffs aren\u2019t as dark or as interesting either, and the Iron Maiden-like dual harmony guitar part from \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d was axed and replaced with more blues scale noodling from Hammett\u2014the guitars go meedley meedley mee and wow wow wooooow and I completely check out because I can predict his next notes before he plays them.\n\nThe first half of \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d has by far the best set of riffs on the album, and would have been an excellent simple midpaced thrasher if it had been kept short and concise, but the verses are padded out with riff repetition and endless bridges, and then the metal stops and they bring in really dull bluesy Grateful Dead-ish noodling\u2014normally quieter interludes in metal are supposed to retain and transform some of the momentum from the earlier part, but this essentially functions as a giant \u201creset\u201d button for the whole song, a total anticlimax, and really, I find it inexcusable\u2014even Manowar could figure out how to do dynamic changes without deflating the tension in their longer songs, and they teetered on the ragged edge of idiotic, childish self-parody through the entire \u201880s (naturally, they fell right into the darkest, cheesiest depths once the \u201890s came around). The heavy riffs come back to close the song with a last go-around of the chorus (always with the chroruses, Metallica), but since the middle of the song was a complete disaster the recapitulation feels less like a triumphant return than yet more repetition of a song that should have been over four minutes ago.\n\n\u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d was initially a song I was willing to defend against metalhead charges of being a dullard groove-metal song of the type Pantera would later shit out by the dozen, and while I still think it has a bit more class than Pantera with its subtle (subtlety! In Metallica!) transformations of the main riff in various ways, the entire song is nonetheless built around just one midpaced mosh riff and derivatives, with no variation in tempo, mood, or overall rhythm at all. This is the sort of song that becomes more and more tedious the more you listen to it and realize how little content there really is, it kind of reminds me (and bear with me here, I\u2019m going out on a limb) Borodin\u2019s In the Steppes of Central Asia, which at first listen seems quite clever in its juxtaposition and transformation of two contrasting melodic themes, but that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all there is to the piece (well aside from Orientalist racism, but that\u2019s another subject for another review\u2026), and as you listen to it a few more times, you\u2019ll see through its simplistic construction and trite emotional appeals and get completely sick of it. So it is with this, it is way less clever than it originally looks and is actually quite a cheap and nasty piece of music.\n\nI\u2019ve already taken \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d to task for its lyrics, but the music only contributes to the onslaught of absurd bathos that is almost certainly the worst song on the album. This is a typical remake of Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d like a thousand metal ballads before it, but even more derivative than usual because Metallica couldn\u2019t write an \u201cepic\u201d melody to save themselves and just reach into their bag of recycled blues rock ideas instead. This completely ruins the form because the original song and all the derivatives that are any good work by using imaginative lead guitar playing and a powerful, convincing singer to create a contrast between the bleak, borderline self-annihilating depression of the verses and a chorus that boldly, defiantly reasserts one\u2019s autonomy and subjectivity, culminating in a hysterical, virtuosic guitar solo, thereby dragging a listener who has the right sort of alienation to buy into it through an emotional wringer, Metallica just succeeded in writing a mawkish hard rock ballad that wallows in the pettiest of teenage resentment and doesn\u2019t even begin to approach its supposed subject matter with the seriousness it deserves. Kirk Hammett\u2019s solos are especially awful here, with his execrable \u201cweeping\u201d blue notes bent in the most generic possible way at the most generic possible times. The ballad eventually gives way to some quite respectable thrash riffs and even dual harmonized leads that sound straight off (a reject from) Ride the Lightning, but it\u2019s far too late to redeem all the garbage that came before it, and Kirk Hammett plays two more solos, blowing his blooze load all over the music just as it was getting mildly interesting. There are at least five guitar solos in this song and they\u2019re all terrible.\n\nThough \u201cSanitarium\u201d got my pick for the worst due to its wretchedly childish sentimental angst, \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d gives it a run for its money through sheer, unrelenting boredom. The bulk of this song is built on amelodic single-chord bashing on repetitive triplet patterns, and ceaseless, tuneless Yorkshire Terrier barking from Hetfield. \u201cBACK TO THE FRONT! BACK TO THE FRONT! BACK TO THE FRONT!\u201d For the love of Christ, someone send him to the front so he\u2019ll shut the fuck up already! Until he blew his voice out in the \u201890s and developed that fake redneck accent, this was the single worst performance of his entire career, and yes, I\u2019m including his \u201cnine-year-old\u2019s Paul Di\u2019Anno impression\u201d clean singing voice from the 1982 demos in that assessment. It just goes on and on for eight nearly unbearable minutes, with the only respite being a faceless blues solo from Hammett (so, not a respite at all). \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d is very similar, only it bashes a bit slower and there\u2019s a slightly more melodic B-section in the middle\u2014I\u2019ve heard it compared to (and sometimes accused of being a plagiarism of) Dave Mustaine, but Dave Mustaine tried harder than this.\n\nAnd then comes \u201cOrion\u201d. The instrumental coat rack that late \u201880s Metallica\u2019s reputation as a \u201cprogressive\u201d band is hung on. \u201cOrion\u201d is Cliff Burton\u2019s baby, and he actually puts in a very impressive performance...that you cannot fucking hear aside from a couple of gimmicky guitar-like leads. Seriously, I had to go to YouTube and listen to a fan remix with the bass cranked up, and he actually does some pretty cool stuff on here. And nobody else does. The rest of the band, the only thing you hear in Flemming Rasmussen\u2019s original mix, all follow the path of least resistance, and Kirk Hammett vomits out two of the most flatulent, derivative, hollow, shoddy, manipulative, obvious blues-rock solos ever recorded. Everything in these solos is done the laziest and most shopworn way possible, and then, instead of orchestrating the skeleton Cliff Burton provided with his bass line in the melodic middle section, they all double him. They just mindlessly trail after Burton like kids following the Pied Piper, because counterpoint might scare the stupid people or something, and you can\u2019t even hear Burton much in the original mix, so the whole thing comes off as a pointless noodlefest. With a second root canal of Kirk Hammett\u2019s guitar dentistry as a segue, they bring back the best riff from the heavy part of the song and run it into the ground by repeating it constantly as it slowly fades out. They don\u2019t even do something like Rainbow\u2019s \u201cStargazer\u201d where they layer more and more florid ornamentation over it as it fades out to keep it interesting, you just get Hetfield chugging and chugging and chugging some more until silence mercifully overtakes them.\n\n\u201cDamage, Inc.\u201d is the only real full-throttle thrasher on this album, so of course it does the same sort of atmospheric bass chords as the mellow diet-prog song before it, for no reason whatsoever. Just like Battery, this intro feels completely disconnected from the actual song and a complete waste of space, and it\u2019s compounded by being the same gimmick used to introduce two songs in a row (and then, with Burton being dead, James Hetfield imitates it on guitar for the intro to \u201cBlackened\u201d on the next album, so if you listen to the albums in order you get the same gimmick intro three times in a row. Even Disturbed aren\u2019t this lazy). The song proper sounds like a timid, hesitant dry run for the harrowing \u201cDyers Eve\u201d on ...And Justice for All, but the genuine hatred and bitterness that ran through that song and gave its triplet-based palm muting exercises life are absent here, both because the lyrics are Metallica waving their dicks around instead of James Hetfield confessing a real anger in his life, and they put far more effort into both the songwriting and the performances on the later song. Sure, it\u2019s heavy, and you can bang your head all day to it, but \u201cbeing pretty heavy\u201d wasn\u2019t good enough by 1986, not with bands like Kreator, Bathory, Sepultura, and Possessed running around. It was mediocre. Metallica were mediocre. A mediocre rock band for a mediocre rock audience, convinced that nothing outside their suburban bubble mattered at all.\n\n(edited 1/25/2018 to correct the spelling of Markus Grosskopf's name)\n",
        "\nWell here it is ladies and gentleman, the album that started thrash! Metallica successfully took NWOBHM and fused it with hardcore punk on their 1983 debut. This album is pure speed throughout, it just doesn't let up! Let's take a look at the album...\n\nFirst. I'd like to say that James Hetfield is a riff machine! Hetfield's riffs are in vein of Diamond Head's Brian Tatler but faster. Hetfield clearly shows his inspiration from the NWOBHM. Hetfield's vocal delivery is also raw and unhinged, he shouts with a raspy edge; unlike his Sean Harris vocal delivery of the demo days.\n\nLars Ulrich does a fantastic job on drums, his aggressive drumming melds well with Hetfield's rhythm guitar. I never understood the hate for Lars, I have always enjoyed his drumming, especially in the earlier days. Ulrich's drumming sounds especially powerful on Kill Em All, the cymbals are very loud but not too over the top. Overall he does well. \n\nThen there's the band's lead guitarist who was a newcomer at the time, Kirk Hammett. As you all may know, Kirk replaced Dave Mustaine after he was fired for violent behavior. Dave also wrote the solos and even received writing credits on 4 tracks, \"The Four Horsemen\" (originally titled \"The Mechanix\"), \"Jump in the Fire\", \"Phantom Lord\" and \"Metal Militia\". However, all due respect to Mustaine, I think that Kirk did a much better job playing the solos. Kirk's execution of the solos is much cleaner and neater, Kirk also plays SUPER fast! When I first listened to Kirk's shredding on Kill Em All, I remember being absolutely blown away by the sheer speed of the solos. My favorite solos on the album are the solos on \"Hit the Lights\", both solos on \"The Four Horsemen\", \"Whiplash\" and \"Phantom Lord\". \n\nThen of course we have the greatest bass player ever, Mr. Cliff Burton. Cliff's performance is absolutely legendary on this album, while his bass is sometimes buried under the mix, his bass pops out occasionally. A good example of this is exactly before the solo on \"The Four Horsemen\", his bass is audible during that particular section. Cliff's shining moment on the album is without a doubt \"Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)\". Cliff downright SHREDS on this track!!! Near the beginning he starts slow and melodic, before he goes crazy and Ulrich kicks in with a drum beat. At the beginning of the track, producer Paul Curcio says these legendary 4 words that would go on to become a famous phrase, \"Bass solo - take one\". It doesn't surprise me that Cliff did this in one take, he's truly amazing. \n\nOverall, Kill Em All doesn't disappoint, the album is just full blown old school thrashing madness, over the 51 minutes that the album spans, there isn't a single boring moment to be found. It's all killer, absolutely no filler! If you want a classic album to rage to look no further! Bang that head that doesn't bang! \n\n\nHighlights: THE WHOLE DAMN THING!\n",
        "\nAfter St. Anger, after Death Magnetic, after Lulu there wasn't really much of a new direction for Metallica to go without taking a massive and embarrassing risk with what was left of their jaded fanbase growing weary of their many failed attempts to branch out. Metallica had nowhere to go but backwards and to go backwards as swiftly and as fully as possible. It's not an exciting proposition and Metallica probably had other ideas and plans, but a return to thrash from them could lead to at least a few new good songs in theory. If they do this, they have to commit, they have to play fast, and they must not do anything ridiculous or too out of the ordinary. As a result we ended up with an album that more or less played it safe with Metallica's return to a faster, more traditional sound.\n\nWhile speedier and more aggressive than most of Metallica's recent material. This only seems to partially capture the riffage and songwriting abilities of old. They go fast alright, and the pace of it all is very refreshing to hear even if the first song is probably the most generic thrash song Metallica could have possibly made. They do get better with the next few songs doing a little more than just rolling drum blasts and fast guitars going \"dududu-dun\" in a simple riff pattern. It's simple but okay thrash with \"Atlas, Rise!\" and \"Moth Into Flame\" trying to go for some sort of hook dynamic moreso than before. It also bears mentioning that the mix is much more robust than before and they've learned from Death Magnetic's mistakes production-wise with it having much more heft and impact. A lot of the songs in question are just simple barrages of fast-paced metal that show Metallica's willingness to go back to their classic style, even if it doesn't reach the creative heights seen on Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning.\n\nNot everything on here is pure thrash and Metallica makes sure to put most of their more energetic tracks at the start so as to rekindle your interest. However, with many of the thrashier tracks feeling just okay and often lacking truly definitive riffs or lines, that doesn't bode well for the tracks in the middle of the album which have a bit of heft, but tend to just go nowhere. A lot of the songs after the first four go lower in speed, but also longer in running time even when the ideas in these songs aren't all that great or especially explosive. It is serviceable, but it does run the risk of being boring, and mostly seems to focus on speed and heaviness while not getting much of the actual content to jump out at you. While closing on \"Spit Out the Bone\" is a smart choice to end the album on, with that being the most intense song on here, and I wish that more songs tried for this kind of aggression instead of meandering. If that had happened, we could have gotten something much better.\n\nHardwired tries to be a return to form for Metallica and it partially succeeds, a little better than Death Magnetic but not enough to be announced as some kind of \"grand return\". It feels like a fast, decent, but average album composed partially of thrash metal and partially composed of some more traditional stuff. It plays it safe by going back to old territory, but doesn't deliver much in the way of truly new or outstanding music. It just feels like \"Hey, here's another thrash album. You liked us when we did thrash, right?\". It's listenable, but truly you could do better with classic Metallica. It comes nowhere close despite being decent this time around.\n",
        "\nLou Reed and Metallica...\n\nWho thought that a mixture of these two artists could ever produce anything good? I seriously want to know what in the burning pits of hell was going through everybody involved with this thing's heads like this was going to be some kind of avant-garde artistic masterwork. I could not think of two artists that could clash harder and sound more nonsensical and lopsided than this, maybe The Wiggles and Deathspell Omega, or Ice Cube and Enya, or Hank Williams and Aphex Twin, but those at least sound like they'd be so out-of-whack that they'd at least make for a good joke. This stuff is unintentionally funny, but alas is totally serious as a musical and artistic endeavor. A lot of people were expecting Metallica to try and reconnect with their old sound after Death Magnetic, y'know rediscover some more of their past strength and refine their new sound a little bit more, but instead we got one of the most nonsensical, confusing, and unlistenable albums ever made, not just by Metallica, not just in metal, not even just in rock, but in music period.\n\nWhere to begin with this thing? Do I talk about Lou Reed or Metallica here? They both do a bad job with Lou sounding geriatric and perverted while Metallica sounds as stock and as nondescript as ever with their contribution being little more than generic thrash metal without much gusto or heaviness to it with James Hetfield interjecting with lines such as \"I AM THE TABLE!\" where he says stuff that makes no sense with such enthusiasm that you'd think he's lost his shit. That's not to say Lou Reed's lyrics and delivery are any better, in fact, they are the worst and most dominant thing on this album. The first line he croaks out is \"I would cut my legs and tits off when I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski\". Now that is a truly golden line to open this awkward and disturbingly sexual musical artwork on! He often rambles out of rhythm and what he's talking about sounds like the ramblings of a senile sexual predator with gender dysphoria. I know this is supposed to be based on some old play about sexual deviance or something that probably has a bit of artistic merit to it, but guys, Is there any way you could make this sound more crude and goofy? There isn't! Maybe if you brought Mike Patton along, but then you'd just be making an ass of another musician and adding more noise to this nonsense.\n\nAnother thing to note is that aside from the obvious ridiculousness of Lulu, it is very tedious and very one-note. Sure, Metallica plays harder on some songs than others, but what does that matter if the music itself is generic at best and not even trying at worst? Whether thrashing out a bit with Hetfield providing backing vocals, or taking it slow to the point where the guitars are just static, Metallica seem to be bringing their C-game. It's one thing if something clashes in a whacky, ridiculous, and energetic way, but this clashes and seems tired and old with Metallica seemingly uninvolved with the rhythmless weirdo delivering pornographic \"beat\" poetry that has about as much energy behind it as Ben Stein reading ads for escort services while Scott Weinrich plays his slowest riffs from Saint Vitus in the background. It's like they barely cared, and if I were any of the members of Metallica in 2011, I would care since we just released a follow-up to our previous worst album, St. Anger with Death Magnetic and our band was skating on thin ice as far as fan perception was concerned. So much so that releasing something even worse than St. Anger like this could tank the band. This whole album consists of an old man rambling sexed-up surrealist nonsense in his most tired voice possible over generic thrash metal. Only the truly insane could find merit in such a dismal and repulsive musical Frankenstein.\n\nThis thing has no business even existing. It defies all sense and sounds horrific. You get two artists who clash and sound as awkward as possible going together on an album that's meandering and full of gut-busting quotes about tits, asses, dogs, and tables that is tedious, underwhelming, and just leaves you feeling crusty and gross. This is a boring slog trying to be modern art, and in many ways it represents pretentiousness in the highest degree by trying to make something \"daring, bold, and brave\" while only being unique with how many times it can get you to cringe and laugh at the same time. This is an insult to Metallica's talent and to Lou Reed's creativity and it has no business being a thing in this world. The only positive about this is that it's kind of funny in a \"why the hell did they do this\" way. The worst part about this thing is that it was the last piece of music the otherwise talented Lou Reed would work on before he died. If there's a more sour note for a musician to go out on, I don't want to know. Rest in peace.\n",
        "\nAfter the horrific embarrassment that was St. Anger, it was virtually guaranteed that Metallica would return to some earlier, more recognizable form of their sound as a way of distancing themselves from their recent mistake. Going off in another crazy direction after that would be enough to bury them as a massive commercial entity as music sales had dropped fast since the early 2000s and people did not want to be burned by another bad Metallica album. Seeing as thrash was coming back into vogue at the time of this album's conception and their most beloved albums were thrash, it seemed like going in that direction was the ideal thing for Metallica in 2008 to do. The resulting album was serviceable in most respects, but did have its fair share of faults.\n\nThe album gets off to a fairly decent start with a pair of thrashy songs that get the motor running. It gets you excited to listen to the rest and has you hoping for more nice, fast metal. The production gets in the way of that with it sounding very plastic. It's said that Lars wanted it this way to make it sound louder and for his drums to be more prominent. He got Newsted's bass removed from Justice and overwhelmed St. Anger with his trash-can banging. While the production job here is certainly more tolerable than St. Anger, it still subtracts from the heaviness. Metallica producers take note: ignore Lars' opinions, it's for the best. This production job hurt the songs, which actually weren't bad for the most part and that's a big damn shame because \"This Was Just Your Life\", \"My Apocalypse\", and \"Broken, Beat, and Scarred\" were decently written, if a bit long, and have some punch hidden in them. They're no \"Disposable Heroes\" or \"Creeping Death\", but they are certainly more fleet than anything released since the mid 90s and stand as decent bits of modern metal.\n\nMost of the music on here ranges from good to boring and unecessary, but never diving into territories of outright bad. Emphasizing the guitars and shortening the songs a bit could help this more since James is starting to show his age with his vocals and the band does not have enough ideas to fill these on-average 7 minute run-times. You get some returning thrash energy and a sense of renewed rigor on a lot of the faster songs. The solos also emphasize speed and I welcome their ripping return. However, the ballads are where this music becomes lacking with \"The Day That Never Comes\" taking 5 minutes to go anywhere due to the first part of the song being very soft and low on motion, and \"The Unforgiven 3\" is just boring, stale, and unnecessary. If you stay away from the ballads, for the most part you have an okay thrash metal album that shows Metallica trying to recreate their old style. It's not as fierce as their older thrash output, but they partially succeed with renewed speed.\n\nDeath Magnetic is kind of what you'd get if someone had asked for a \"standard Metallica album\" in their modern style. It captures some of the speed and intensity with blinding solos and songs with some punch to them, but also messes the production up and gets a bit overindulgent with the songwriting. This is by no means terrible, but it is also by no means excellent and it is even slightly outmatched by the Black Album since that album sounded angrier, more evil, and more catchy than this. As a regular thrash album, it hits all the marks, but doesn't snag a lot of bullseyes or headshots at the range. The thrashing was decent, but the ballads were bland. It's no surprise people had mixed feelings about this. Metallica were moving back to their most beloved sound, but it also felt a bit odd after St. Anger's blunders and too commercially \"tactical\" as a result. The songs were mostly decent, but also paled in comparison to older works and didn't get a decent production job until the remaster. It's semi-decent, but suffers from too many flaws to really be good.\n",
        "\nThat's what I think when one of the songs from St. Anger emerges out of the back of my memory and reminds me about this annoying collection of of musical blowouts and stumbles that involves having to endure the most painful and inept moments experienced by one of the biggest names in heavy metal. Get them out of my head. This thing is a legendary blunder and the music on display is pure people repellent. Metallica weren't really in the best of shape when this was being made as they'd just lost Jason Newsted and had to deal with producer Bob Rock as the bassist until Robert Trujillo formerly of Suicidal Tendencies would join midway through recording. James Hetfield was also stewing in frustration having just gotten out of rehab for alcoholism when recording started. According to the film Some Kind of Monster, everybody involved was stressed out, tired, and angry with each other and that doesn't really translate well into studio work if everybody is too pissed off to focus. All things considered, knowing what I know, I'd be surprised if this album didn't turn out a mess.\n\nThe musical aspects of this album are abysmal in just about every respect. The guitars are sloppy and often plodding. James' voice often sounds off-key and grating especially with his higher notes. The songwriting is either too off-kilter to follow or so plodding and tedious that you just give up on some songs out of boredom. The worst aspect of all are the drums which are often Lars Ulrich smashing the snare as hard as he can in a way that feels like a shitty old folk hiccups treatment, you know the one where you put a bucket on your head and get somebody to whack the bucket? That's what Lars' drums make parts of this album feel like. It also doesn't help that the production is so focused on his drums that he ends up drowning out the guitars and just leaving a weak, dazed James Hetfield singing his lines over a battery of trash-can snares. The lyrics to this thing are noticeably corny and immensely quotable just for the pure stupid factor they bring. There are a ton of stupid lyrics peppered throughout this thing like birdshot.\n\nSome particularly goofy quotes from St. Anger include:\n\nMY LIFESTYLE! DETERMINES MY DEATHSTYLE!\nYOU FLUSH IT OUT, YOU FLUSH IT OUT!\nGIT 'EM OUT MAH HEAD!\nNot only do I not know the answer, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS!\nLOOKOUT MOTHERFUCKERS, HERE I COME!\nShoot me again, I ain't dead yet...\nKILL KILL KILL KILL KILL!\n\nSt. Anger also has a problem with being an extremely messy album in many senses. The first thing people will bring up is the production, and yes it does suck, which is weird because I love stuff like sludge, black metal, and crust punk. I normally like dirty production, but here it gets abused so badly by making the sound as thick and as pounding as possible while emphasizing those piercing drums over everything else. It sounds sloppy in a way that really hurts the album. That being said, even if the production was cleaner and more balanced, that still wouldn't have saved this from the abysmal songwriting. The only salvageable track on here is probably \"Frantic\" since you could make the song much better by getting rid of the corniest lyrics and dialing the drums back a bit.\n\nEverything else is riddled with problems that range from James Hetfield's weak and sometimes grating vocals, to plodding riffs, to song structures that go nowhere, to builds in momentum that end up getting wasted, to songs with little to no progression being extremely boring and long, to wack lyrics that just sound silly. One example of lyrics ruining a song to the point where they need to be re-written entirely is \"My World\" which is pretty groovy, but also home to lyrics about \"motherfuckers\" getting into James' head and about how it's his world and you can't have it, SUCKER! Also, once you start getting towards the end of the album, you end up with a lot of the music falling slightly out of time like they just stopped caring. Hell, \"Purify\" sounds like it was made specifically to piss people off since it sounds like a cacophony. There is no other way to describe it than a cacophony, and that translates well to parts of the rest of the album. St. Anger is a mess of an album with almost everything somehow going wrong and it seems like Metallica wrote this just to get people to fuck off because they were all tired of, and pissed at each other. This album hates you and wants you to leave, that's the message I get from the mixture of poorly written songs, confused vocals, piercing drums, only sometimes in-time playing, and meme-worthy lyrics.\n\nAll things considered, this was probably going to turn out very bad no matter what considering this was made during a time of MASSIVE inter-personal stress for Metallica and it was during a time when heavy metal and hard rock had some of their worst acts at peak influence, among other factors. Still, that's no reason for such an assault on music to exist and come from a band this prominent and influential. This album was messy, it was obnoxious, and it was one of the corniest things Metallica had ever put out with some of their worst musicianship. It has gone down in history as one of metal's worst albums and for good reason. The combination of irritating sounds and lame songs on this album made it impossible to enjoy or take seriously. This thing deserves its reputation as a true stinker.\n",
        "\nGetting something like this out of late 90s Metallica was a bit of a surprise, but a pleasant and much needed one at that. Garage Inc. is a 2-disc collection of covers from Metallica's vast array of influences spanning 70s rock, NWOBHM, and hardcore punk among other styles. It also blends together some newer covers together with the old Garage Days Re-Revisited EP for a full-featured experience of surprisingly kickass and faithful covers of the original source material. For the most part the songs chosen to cover are great, as is Metallica's rendition of them. with a nice crunch and sometimes a unique approach for the ones that are pretty far from metal or punk. I know a lot of us treat this as more of a side deal than a fully-fledged Metallica album, but given when this came out, and the sheer scale and scope of the album, I say Garage Inc. is actually pretty important if you want to know what songs helped influence Metallica to be Metallica.\n\nRight out of the gate the guys decide to hit you with one of the most aggressive pieces on here, a Discharge cover. If that's anything, it's a sign that Metallica are going to give us a refreshingly heavy, punchy, sometimes thrashy take on these songs. Now, that isn't the only style of cover that's done, but it's the most prominent one, as of course Metallica play thrash metal which isn't very far removed from the speed metal, punk, and NWOBHM that makes up the majority of the covers so it only makes sense to play it close and faithful, but give it your own spin. A lot of these covers are high-speed experiences with a lot of octane being put in the tank. It's the sort of music to rack up speeding tickets to. For the covers of less metallic songs, Metallica decide to get a little more creative in how they bring such tunes into their genre. Radio stations are already in a habit of playing the Bob Seger cover \"Turn the Page\", but that's probably because it's Metallica doing the Load/Reload style of dusty southern-tinged metal, but doing it very well with a lot of character and atmosphere which is more than can be said of a good 4/5ths of those entire two albums' original songs. Indeed, Metallica feel very much alive and in the spirit while playing these covers, regardless of their original genre.\n\nMost of the covers on here are great renditions of already great songs, but there are some variances in performance that lead to this having (for mostly better and sometimes worse) a lot of variety on the album. Some stuff ends up being really solid despite being very different from the normal Metallica fare which can vary from soaring and melodic, to ripping and angry, to creeping and gloomy. Sure there are a few lame ones like the perennial radio darling \"Whiskey in the Jar\" which just feels a bit too silly and jaunty, but the lameness is always mild and usually swift to come and go. There are also the times when James tries to cover vocalists who clearly have a better range than him, but that's also a minor complaint as he still fits well with Metallica's renditions of the songs. Some of what gets done on here is actually pretty impressive considering \"Tuesday's Gone\" features Metallica plus members of Primus, Corrosion of Conformity, Blues Traveler, Faith No More, Alice in Chains, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, the very band Metallica was covering. I'm not super into the song with it being full-on southern rock, but i'm still impressed at the sheer number of contributors and how much harmony everybody has during it. Most of what you get on the rest of the album is shredding, speedy, old-school metallic hecticness, but it is interesting to see this kind of variety play out on an album such as this. It shows the lengths that Metallica were willing to go to make their covers seem faithful. Garage Inc. provides some pretty good insight into the varied influences of Metallica and if anything serves as a great segway into some really killer lesser-known acts who probably deserve more attention than they get.\n\nGarage Inc. is a solid piece of Metallica's \"side\" discography that showcases their influences, their talent, their flexibility, and gives us some gnarly-ass tunes and some new ideas about which bands to check out next. This album probably served as a beacon of hope for Metallica fans in the late 90s who wanted a bit of the old intensity back and it seemed like they were getting some of that with Garage Inc... only for St. Anger to blast that hope into smithereens just a few years later. Still, this was a series of intense, faithful covers that Metallica was very much in their right minds to create.\n",
        "\nIt's no secret that Reload is just the leftover songs from Load and this should be an indicator of the quality of this music. It's more tepid redneck blues metal with a lot of long songs, simple structures and slow builds. There really isn't any stylistic difference between this album and the one that came before it. This is probably another sign of Metallica being more a commercial entity than a creative one when they end up putting the unused songs originally meant to go on an old album onto a separate one and releasing it a year later. If you were expecting any differences from this album compared to the last one, they're extremely few and hard to notice, but that's largely due to Metallica themselves treating this as Load part 2. Honestly, It's in the same realm of mediocre as Load.\n\nReload does pick a good note to start on with \"Fuel\" which is still a corny song, but a damn fun one just because it holds nothing back with how hick-ish, crazy, and fast it is. The riffing honestly isn't that bad either. Everything after that is more of the same boring, plodding, slow-building bluesy nonsense with a few simple, tepid, catchy rock songs to hold you over. The same weak guitars and goofy Hetfield vocals litter this collection of more mopey redneck rock. It's not even the fun kind of redneck rock like \"Fuel\" was able to pull off with it's over the top singing and fast tempo. There are very few pickups in pace and there isn't much as far as creativity goes with a lot of the album feeling tired. \"Carpe Diem Baby\" even uses a similar starting rhythm to \"The Memory Remains\". If that is not a sign that Metallica are out of ideas on here, I don't know what is.\n\nI really don't have much more to say about Reload because it does so little and doesn't give me much of note to talk about since it's just another smattering of the same blandness from Load, just slightly less impressive. It's the usual bluesy southern metal songs with a slow build and maybe some silly little bits of catchiness or a sappy, motionless ballad that does nothing as far as melody or emotion are concerned. This really is just a weak, forgettable album with very little to offer aside from a bit of silly fun with \"Fuel\" and James Hetfield's overactive YEAH-ing. It's an unnecessary addition to an album that was already bad to begin with. This really is not worth your time, people.\n",
        "\nYeah, Metallica was certainly changing and it made a bit of sense considering how big of a shift the Black Album was for them. Yet, I don't think people were expecting an album stuffed with influence from blues and southern rock, and a somewhat more relaxed demeanor out of Metallica for their follow-up to their self-titled. The change was probably brought on as a result of the landscape the Black Album helped to create with thrash mostly played out and gone, with alternative metal bands rising in its wake and new sounds that were going from innovative to trendy really fast. Metallica was going to make a change simply because regressing made little sense then and they were now a commercial entity expected to sell. As a result, Load was an extremely middling album with a few songs that were made to garner airplay and a lot of others that don't dare to either offend or excite.\n\nOne could label this thing as being tepid and derivative considering the close playing towards new influences added to their sound. Metallica were listening to a lot of Corrosion of Conformity, Alice in Chains, Skynyrd, and Social Distortion at the time. All of which are decent bands, but Metallica extracted the style of these bands, but not really the substance for their newest volley of songs. A lot of what we get on here is at best simple, yet catchy and groovy from the singles and rather meandering and underwhelming from a lot of the other material. They have all of these new influences and somehow you don't get the energy, punch, or emotive strength of those influences. \"Ain't My Bitch\" sounds decent, but it also sounds like a COC b-side with James Hetfield in Pepper Keenan\u2019s place. \"The House That Jack Built\" is another example of Metallica playing too close to their new influences since it sounds like a boring Alice in Chains ripoff with James even sounding a lot like Layne Staley during some of these passages in this song. Not only is this album derivative, it also doesn't add much to, or even give any extra kick to these new influences added. The songs are usually unexciting and lack in energy or flow.\n\nHow do they lack in energy or flow? Well most of this album is sluggish and doesn't capture much heft or feeling to the rhythm or the song structures. It doesn't pick up all that much and the only later track with much intensity is \"Wasting My Hate\" and it's kind of a chore to get to that song through the whole earlier album since most of it is similar sluggish, bluesy dross with guitars that only have a bit of groove to them and very little fire. They use a ton of slow builds that lead to minimal payoffs. I know the slower tracks often try for something emotionally moving or moody, but I have a hard time feeling much with the dull instrumentation and Hetfield's overly accented redneck vocals. He's adding so much emphasis to his voice that it almost becomes silly. There's also no real moment where Load kicks things up and delivers some truly intense blues metal, for the most part everything is middling, the tempo, the guitars, the mood, the lyrics, even James is pretty moderate with his delivery despite how hick-ish he sounds. That's also not to mention how some songs are just dull and wimpy like \"Hero of The Day\" and the cover of country classic \"Mama Said\" where it all focuses on Hetfield too much while the music is slow and lightweight. There is just too much meandering and not enough action.\n\nLoad is the result of turning Metallica from a creative entity to a commercial one, and ending up stuck in the mid 90s when metal in general was trying to find new styles and sounds. They picked some good influences to draw from, but played it too safe with songs that are somewhat passable, but still rather boring and slow to rise. Even the more energetic tracks are rather simple and don't offer much besides a bluesy groove and a chorus to stick in your head. It feels underwhelming and lacking compared to anything Metallica has released beforehand. I also find the pseudo-redneck gimmick to be just flat-out goofy, but sadly not goofy enough to be fun. It doesn't go for any new heights in anything that they do, if anything this is Metallica dialing their talent ever further back while trying to capitalize on catchiness that's somewhat there and groove that isn't all that intense. I think this album is really boring and not all that ambitious. There's some decent moments, but they are so few and merely good, not exceptional. The pacing is also boring. I think the bands that influenced Metallica so obviously during this time have far outdone Metallica. Load was tame and slow, that's all I have to say.\n",
        "\nThis album was monstrous with how commercial it was for heavy metal, and even for rock music in general. This is still a top-selling album, even up to today, and if anything signaled the end of 80s thrash metal, this monster-seller was probably the torchbearer. Metallica reached commercial success on a level unseen in metal before or since, and is probably the single biggest selling metal album out there. A month before Nirvana came out with the similarly successful Nevermind, Metallica beat them to the punch and was the first bullet to the head of the 80s sound. Metallica shook things up by changing to a more accessible, radio-friendly sound by slowing down, simplifying the songs, and playing lower and heavier. It had such runaway success that it probably tempted other bands to change during the 90s in pursuit of similar success and helped to turn Metallica into the powerful commercial entity they would be for the remaining future. Musically, it isn't impressive, just okay, but due to its sheer influence and popularity, it's important.\n\nThe first big thing that characterizes Metallica is the shift away from the stylings of thrash metal towards something slower and lower. There are still some traces of the thrash sound on here, but that's reserved for the faster (and admittedly cooler) songs such as \"Holier Than Thou\", \"Through the Never\", and \"The Struggle Within\" which probably channel the most energy, speed, and attitude out of all the songs on here with their more uptempo, driving take on the album's thicker sound. Most of the rest of Metallica tries to go for a more weighty, riff-centered approach and that's what is heard whether the song is a radio staple or a deeper cut. Like a lot of radio-centered music, this album's popularity was largely due to the success of one particular single, \"Enter Sandman\". You can't talk about this album without mentioning it. It succeeded because of how well it blended catchiness and evil with quite a few quotable lines that are cheesy, but memorable like \"Off to Never-Never Land\". It's riff is downright threatening and the song gathers a ton of strength off it despite being a simple verse/chorus affair. James is shouting loud and making his voice big and threatening. It works well and it's understandable that radio would latch onto it. It is good (despite being a bit simple) if you can get past how overexposed it is. But it also shows where Metallica was going from here with more accessible songs and simpler songwriting. This change in direction left most people who liked the classic earlier Metallica albums feeling weary.\n\nI guess it was understandable to want to simplify their sound a bit after Justice was derided for being too lengthy and not getting to the point fast enough. However, Metallica goes a bit too far in this regard and falls short of its predecessors by a decent-sized margin. A lot of the punch and speed of before is dialed back and there are far fewer shifts in riffing or tempo. Most of the songs feel like a long slab of a heavy riff with a bit of a change-up during the chorus before going back to the same riff as before. This means that most of these songs are okay at best and aren't deep enough to warrant a bunch of re-listens. Still, a sense of darkness is maintained with the riffs generally being low and churning with James shouting over them. Speaking of James Hetfield, his delivery is much more booming and gruff, and he starts delivering some of his now-legendary \"YEAH\"s throughout the album. They don't become meme-ably goofy yet, but this is where that became more common. None of this really comes off as hokey or bad, just a bit thin on substance and honestly I'd rather see more added to this album like tempo shifts, atmospheric sections, a greater variety of riffs, and slightly meatier and crazier songs, rather than seeing things removed. The only songs I would rather not hear on this album are the wimpy, plodding ballad \"Nothing Else Matters\" and the plodding patriotic meathead anthem \"Don't Tread on Me\". Everything else was mostly okay, but lacking a certain creativity or depth to it that a bit of extra writing and variety could have made great. Like I said before, this isn't a bad album judging by the music alone. It just feels like meaty ear-candy due to the simplified, overly accessible song structures.\n\nMy thoughts on Metallica are many and pretty complicated. It's not a bad album, nor is it especially great. It's just okay and does a lot less on terms of songwriting than prior albums. I honestly think this thing did more damage than good with similar thrash bands noting the success of this album and changing their style just like Metallica did here in hopes of reaping a sizeable paycheck. It also showed Metallica that they could do more with less, and they ended up trying less and less later on, and sometimes went in very strange, but not really rewarding directions. They'd stick with some variant of this more boiled-down style for a while and people saw this shift as so massive that it alienated a lot of old fans. They would also end up losing their creativity and identity as time went on with work that would never match up to the previous 80s material. In spite of all that, I have very little malice towards Metallica. It's a decent album with some decent songs, but it feels rather thin once you get past the lead singles and the low guitar tone. You just feel like something great could have been done with this, but the time for that has long since passed, and the album became iconic simply from single airplay and the passage of time.\n",
        "\nI guess it seems only natural that Metallica would want to progress and make their songs more involved, as that worked for them extremely well on Master of Puppets, but there were quite a few factors that kept Justice away from being truly exceptional. That's not to say it's bad, it's just one step forward, two steps back for Metallica. The songs are bigger, more involved, and more complex than before, but they aren't as sleek and focused as the ones on Master of Puppets and lack a bit in memorability. You see, Metallica was looking to progressive rock as an inspiration and wanted this to be a big deal with big songs and set their ambitions a bit too high. There's also the issue of bassist Cliff Burton's death, finding a replacement in Jason Newsted, and then proceeding to treat him like a wet sock and throw out his bass contributions in the final mix of the album. In spite of all this, the album still works and delivers some decent heavy songs, it's just that it pales in comparison to its predecessor.\n\nI figure I should talk about the good in this album first. The ambition on Justice results in some songs that make good use of their extended lengths. The first one to come to mind in that regard is the harrowing \"One\" which makes the most of its slow, moody build, and jarring, marching release of heavy, speedy guitar riffs. The album still maintains an air of menace with a very stern guitar sound and ominous clean notes that serve atmospheric progression and an air of tension very well. The riffs throughout the album still manage to get heads banging and things still move at a swift sprint. Sometimes the tempo is more stomping than fully thrashy, but that does produce a pretty good number of tightly-coiled rhythms that blend well with the normal darkness of Metallica's signature sound like the stalking trudging of \"Harvester of Sorrow\" or the evil march that leads into \"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\" which also features some manic lyrics and really mosh-oriented guitars that don't lose the shroud of darkness. I find that Justice has a lot to offer and a lot of it is still pretty damn fulfilling and keeps mostly faithful to the sound that made Metallica excellent.\n\nConcluding that, I should also mention where this falls short, which is a bit hard considering it's still ahead of most of what's out there, but it is a noticeable fall from Master of Puppets. The most noticeable and most damning of them all us the absolute lack of Jason Newsted's bass in the mix which takes out a lot of the punch and leaves the production thin. It gets especially damning when you hear how great everybody else sounds. The instruments that are there come in nice and clear and Hetfield delivers a very impassioned performance with his fearsome lyrics and singing, but because Lars wanted his drumming front and center, he got the mixer to minimize the bass as much as possible. Seriously, fuck you Lars. If Cliff Burton had lived to 1988 and you tried that with him around, I'm certain he'd have beaten you stupid. There's also a problem with some songs being too overblown and stretched out for their own good. Some songs could have been cut down in length or changed up more to have better effect. Instead it just ends up being decent, but not especially notable compared to other Metallica songs. Some like \"To Live is to Die\" are really overindulgent and would benefit from being more concise. More big, iconic riffs would also be welcome, even though there are already quite a few, I'd like it if what was here jumped out more prominently and completely. These flaws are far from deal-breakers, but they do have an effect on how I view Justice relative to other early Metallica.\n\nStill, this album does come down pretty gracefully from the heights of Master of Puppets. The transition to a slightly more progressive sound feels natural and the music still has a strong aggressive spirit to it. Where good riffs arise, they hit fast and fierce and once \"One\" comes and goes, the memorability comes back and makes for some songs that you can remember and return to. It really is the biggest \"grower\" in Metallica's discography in that you appreciate this album the more you listen to it since it's so ambitious, maybe overly so, but not so overly so that it becomes a chore. It's still a commendable effort and it's flaws don't change the fact that it's composed well, and a damn solid collection of thrashers that have all the sway of skyscrapers in an earthquake. Every song tries hard and they do a decent job of expanding a bit on the sounds of Master of Puppets. However, a little kick in the ass to get things moving more quickly would've helped, and some bass too. With that being said, I still find this album perfectly enjoyable and it fits well into the classic Metallica canon.\n",
        "\nThis album needs no introduction, it's Metallica's most famous and iconic album of their thrash days. Master of Puppets is where they started channeling more grandiosity and more catchiness into their sound. It's a bit smoother around the edges than Ride the Lightning with the first little glimmers of progginess showing up here with the songs being more ambitious, but also more digestible. It retains a lot of the viciousness of Ride the Lightning's blistering paces and menacing atmosphere while feeling like a sleeker beast with some newer tricks involved. It feels like a very natural progression in that they'd want to make things sleeker and more sonically developed after pushing their heaviness envelope on the last album. This would become Metallica's most iconic thrash album thanks to this extra dash of skill added to some of their strongest songs. There are reasons this album is so well known, and it ain't because of T-shirts.\n\nIf any song is to prime you for how the rest of an album will sound, it has to be the first one, and with \"Battery\" it shows you just what you're in for. An acoustic intro sets things up to rise, then the electric guitars chime in with a much more massive and aggressive sound and then launches into a fast-paced assault of riffs that is kind of like being battered by a storm of fists. It also features two solos both of which play off of the song's momentum perfectly. Songs like this form the steel skeleton upon which Master of Puppets is built. The composition of this album is more involved than what most of us expect from songs that are often seen as catchy thrash essentials even for people who aren't balls-deep into metal. While the riffs are designed to get into your head as catchy as they are, there's also skillfully placed tempo shifts, sometimes more than one intricate and razor-sharp solo in a song, dark clean guitar melodies that are mixed smoothly into the main electric riffs, and a mixture of build styles that vary from spooky and acoustic, to stomping and rousing with a great track of how to build and release momentum. All of these elements are shown skillfully on this album that blends sophisticated composition with accessibility and thrash attitude. You can tell a lot of work went into this, and it reaped some kickass musical returns.\n\nMaster of Puppets does a lot to establish a sense of dread and aggression that permeates the whole album and translates into some really solid atmosphere. The band does well at creating an aura appropriate for each of their songs whether they do cold, lonely, and claustrophobic like on \"Welcome Home\" with its clean guitar melodies, deranged and evil like on \"Leper Messiah\" with a chanting chorus and stomping riffs, or warlike and combative with \"Disposable Heroes\" and its barked vocals and charging guitars. The sound fits the subject matter of whatever song is playing much more closely than you'd expect and integrating that feeling in with the riffs and lyrics is something I wish were more common. The more intricate composition shines throughout and even with this fact being true, every single track has something memorable about it. Hetfield's shouts and enticing lyrics like \"blood will follow blood\" and other such lines draw you in and the lead riffs are varied and stand strong on their own with no failure in the slightest. Every song also has engaging intros and section transitions that keep the songs engaging while maintaining dynamics. If there we a piece that showed off this newfound skill in a pure form, it would be the almost classical sound of \"Orion\" courtesy of Cliff Burton and his bass melodies that harmonize well with the other guitars to create something that feels spacey, yet elegant and shows how melodically strong Metallica has become. It does fast and dark the best, but Master of Puppets also shows mood and depth while making their songs strong, anthemic, and iconic.\n\nIn my mind, Master of Puppets is where Metallica peaked and still serves as a great example of how to make not just a good thrash album, but an exceptional metal album period. It goes hard and fearsome while making their songs sleek and memorable. It's more than just a bunch of thrashing. It has dynamics, harmonics, and ambition that is realized throughout the album and this is exemplified with the fact that every song on here stamps its own mark with distinction and covers everything from fear, to isolation, to war, and derangement in a way that hits you harder than a simple rampage of riffs could. They do the riffs great too, but the feeling of being dragged under by \"Master of Puppets\" the song, or charging into fearsome combat with \"Damage, Inc.\" are sound experiences that are bracing and right in every way. Those are just two of the many things that stand out about this album, the whole thing is full of them. Every moment is golden on here and the songs do this sinister album justice. It fully deserves its status as a classic and as a signature album of the thrash metal genre.\n",
        "\nRide the Lightning is where Metallica started taking their mission of going harder, heavier, and faster much more seriously. While Kill 'Em All was thrashy and aggressive, it was still rooted in older metal conventions somewhat, and was very catchy and playful compared to this behemoth of darkness, aggression, and speed. On this album, Metallica would release some of their most famous and most threatening tracks ever. Ride the Lightning is a landmark piece that's still extreme even when compared to modern thrashers. With its signature songs and newfound darkened seriousness, this album upped the intensity and made one hell of a statement for early thrash metal.\n\nYou can tell right out of the gate that these guys weren't playing around anymore. After a brief intro of acoustic guitars on \"Fight Fire With Fire\", Metallica surges into action with some of the fastest and heaviest guitar play they've ever done in a song about the threat of nuclear mutually assured destruction. The rowdy rockers you knew on Kill 'Em All have turned into serious, stern titans of fast-paced metal. The lyrics also show a shift with the songs about war being more serious and less cocky. The other topics shift from songs about rocking and metalhead life to songs about suicide, execution, and other horror stories. This more serious tone is reflected in the music as well, whether it's the ominous, imposing, stomping march riff on \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\", or the bleak acoustic guitar melody on \"Fade To Black\", or the insidious headbanging rhythm to \"Creeping Death\" you are always getting a very dark and committed sound out of Metallica on Ride the Lightning. The guitars are more abrasive and less melodic, the tempo is often blistering, and Hetfield's singing is considerably less playful and more so exudes fear and sometimes melancholy. Even with how dark this gets, just about every track on here is designed to be at least moderately catchy and they snag you in a way that makes you come back for more. Every song has a big, distinct intro that helps let you know what you're in for and that often sets the tone very well before they slam the main rhythm into you. Metallica had become experts of leading people into their songs with enticing intro riffs and making them stay with ripping main guitar play, as well as memorable rhythms and vocal lines. It's almost like their skills have been multiplied since Kill 'Em All.\n\nThis album also shows Metallica broadening their musical horizons and continuing to stretch their sound beyond the thrash blueprint. It's a funny thing when a genre is in its infancy and all of the bands that set the rules are the first ones to break them. Metallica not only go at ripping, super-fast tempos, but also show off their talent at making big, slow, imposing riffs, iconic acoustic melodies, and progressive instrumental epics. They had little restraint on them and varied their songs quite a bit. Even songs that follow the same speedy style such as \"Fight Fire With Fire\" and \"Creeping Death\" only sound similar in speed, while their rhythms are prominent, sinister, super-fast, and they stand tall apart from each other. Prominent, heavy songwriting was all that mattered on here and that translated into an album that was mostly dark thrash, but showed talent, variety, and a skill for snagging you with a good hook or lead. Everything from simple thrashing to epic acoustic melodies has those strong leads that just make you remember it all and keeps you ready to reset the songs once they end.\n\nRide the Lightning is a darker, faster, meaner, and more serious Metallica album that gives their old, catchy rocking persona a new edge and some new variety. It also helped to further divorce thrash from it's rock-based traditional metal roots with more pure rage and speed. Metallica is heavier, thrashier, darker, more multi-faceted, and more mature with such a beast of an album. One only needs to be reminded of legendary songs such as the crushing \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" and the slow-building, but epic \"Fade To Black\" to get a sense that this isn't an album to be underestimated. The songwriting is iconic and varied, and an atmosphere of destruction permeates a large chunk of the album. It is a landmark due to the quality of the music, the memorability of it, the sheer speed, and the lengths to which it stretched beyond the creative boundaries of thrash. It is undeniably a classic with many signature pieces on it that did a lot to cement Metallica's place among the greats.\n",
        "\nAh, the first Metallica album. Kill 'Em All is probably Metallica's most \"traditional\" sounding album on terms of style. Even though there wasn't much of a tradition back then in heavy music, you had metal, and you had punk, that was it. Subgenres weren't really a thing in the early 80s even though a seasoned rock fan could easily tell a \"real\" metal album apart from the shiny glam rock of the time. Metallica started off as one of those bands making faster, rawer metal with just a bit of punkish speed to pay homage to their metal idols like Diamond Head and Motorhead while sticking it to the Motley Crues and Quiet Riots of the world. With just that spark of punky rawness, they made one of the prototypical thrash metal albums and a whole bunch of rousing, riff-loaded songs to fill it.\n\nThe speed is the first thing you notice on this album. The riffing is choppy and full of youthful vigor courtesy of future Megadeth founder, Dave Mustaine, and James Hetfield's rough shouted vocals add a catchy factor to it. Metallica let you know they're here to go all \"metal up your ass\" on you from the opening notes of \"Hit the Lights\" and they keep this speed up throughout the album. You don't quite hit the level of darkness or blistering speed you'd hear on Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets and the music as a whole feels pretty \"rock and roll\" rather than 100% pure thrashing fury, but thrash is still the main style here, and it was still in its formative years so it had to start somewhere. While still not on overdrive, there's plenty of catchy aggression to be found on here with \"The Four Horsemen\", \"Whiplash\", and \"No Remorse\" being more jagged, resembling the future thrash sound much more. The riffs capitalize on headbanging with their prime mission being to get you to do just that, bang your head, and man do they succeed.\n\nMetallica also show their youth quite a bit on here. The vocal delivery and song structures are still pretty hook-laden despite going against the grain of metal trends at the time. It's clear they had their sights set on rock stardom from day one. James's singing is probably most emblematic of this the way he sometimes howls and shouts for emphasis even while generally being catchy like on \"Jump in the Fire\" shouting \"COME ON!\". All the songs are decent, but they aren't straying far from conventional hard rock songwriting, just going much faster than normal, not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact, it's a songwriting style that sticks well. I just find their later efforts more crushing, varied, and creative. This however, is still a great place to start, especially when that added speed makes the riffs and solos all the more thrilling. Especially with how screaming wild the solos all throughout Kill 'Em All are. They're young alright, but off to a good start here.\n\nMetallica applied their speed to the heavy metal stylings they already knew and loved from their influences on Kill 'Em All and helped lay the blueprint for many other nascent thrash bands across the world. It was close to the sound of bands like Diamond Head with a much rougher sound and choppier, more aggressive riffing and a slight punk influence. Metallica wanted to push things faster, harder, and heavier than before, and for the time, it was something new and was one of the first of the bunch when it comes to thrash. There may have been others, but this was swift and definitive enough to deserve its prominence. If you like your Metallica rockin' and catchy, this is a good place to look as the songs I've mentioned previously throughout this review have gone on to be thrash metal essentials. It's a pretty kickass album.\n",
        "\n\"This certainly sounds like a continuation of Death Magnetic\", Lars said with misplaced optimism, as if unaware that album was a reeking plague cart of cadaverous concepts drawn by foul-smelling horses. \"I love Rick Rubin; we all love Rick,\" Lars added, as if unaware that Rick Rubin is a dizzyingly incompetent producer who everyone quite rightfully hates. And thus, what little hope I had for Hardwired was dashed against the rocks. It would be more sufferance, more disappointment, more contrived southern rock influence, and more mispronounciations of the word \"Yeah\".\n\nBut then I remembered that Lars is wrong about literally everything. As it turns out, Hardwired doesn't sound like Death Magnetic, nor was it bludgeoned to death in the recording studio by a potato-faced caveman. It's actually a series of competent echoes from Metallica's marginally tolerable past, replete with a unique identity and creative moments. In the same vein as Accept's Blood of the Nations or Saxon's Call to Arms, a distinct effort has been made to rekindle some of the band's old 'x factors'. In Metallica's case, it's their youthful, quasi-melodic approach to power-thrash that hasn't earnestly seen the light of day since ...And Justice for All. \n\nAlthough there's a thankful absence of \"Yeahee-yea-yuh\"s, we're still dealing with handlebar mustache Hetfield; that is to say, angsty wails in that impossibly annoying cowboy accent. Throughout 'Murder One', their tribute to the late, great Lemmy, Hetfield's southern twang is preposterous to the point of self-parody. Just how many syllables can garnish the word \"damn\"? Hetfield intends to find out, hoping to rekindle his band's longstanding triad with the Superbowl, Wrestlemania, and other similarly meritorious pursuits.\n\nThis makes the callback to Cthulhu in 'Dream No More' feel even more out of place. In the middle of this 'Tallica tailgate party, they suddenly remind us that they were once huge Lovecraft nerds. Despite being night and day, thematically, 'Dream No More' is business as usual from a songwriting perspective. It's not an elaborate instrumental like Ride the Lightning's 'Call of Ktulu', nor is there a single instrumental in this seventy-seven minute goliath. Come to think of it, there's hardly any emphasis whatsoever on technical musicianship, which makes the pacing feel similarly work-shirking as Metallica and the Load debacles.\n\nAnd that brings me to the crux of the issue; this album manages to be pretty damn boring in spite of its smattering of decent ideas. Owing somewhat to its length but mainly to its slavish formula, full spins of Hardwired... to Self Destruct can feel like endurance tests, mindlessly shambling from one burbling riff to the next. The aforementioned uptempo tracks are briefly invigorating, but I still would've liked to see more variety in Ulrich's beats, and more variety in Hetfield's voice. Like, for instance, if sometimes it wasn't happening.\n\nRest assured, I haven't forgotten about Metallica's place as the genre's uncontested best seller, so I know my wishes for technical musicianship and coloring outside the lines must come across as quaint. Vaguely thrashy tracks or no, Hardwired is so much safer and more predictable than the bombastic theatrics of days gone by; that ship has sailed and capsized. The most we can really expect from Metallica is a rehash of the Black Album, with slightly renewed stock in aggression. And that's precisely what we got.\n",
        "\nTwo kind of people find it difficult to understand Metallica's position in the history of metal: haters and casual listeners. This opinion is not for you both. Knowing the historical importance of Metallica is, in my opinion, an essential assumption to understand Death Magnetic.\n\nThis is not an honest album. Actually, I found it quite surgical, though that does not mean it's a bad album. Nonetheless, choosing 11 songs to make the final cut with the intention of boil down a 27-year career (to date) seems to me a very ambitious, unnatural and, in a way, overbearing task. It's also for this reason that I think some songs or parts of songs here and there sound misplaced, as if they did not fit the album.\n\nAs a whole, the songs are good and even for the most skeptical, there are some truly brilliant moments. This is a good sign with regard to the health of the band and also the proof that they still have a small spark able to remind reminiscences of ancient times.\n\nIndividually speaking, everyone is sick and tired of knowing that Hetfield had to take singing lessons at some point in his life and that, after all, it sounded better when he could not sing, but just barked. Anyway I love his vocal performance on songs like \"That Was Just Your Life\", \"The Unforgiven III\" or \"The Judas Kiss\". He did a good job throughout the album. The riffs? Well ... he's a hell of a guitarist and has written, over the years, some of the fastest / most complex / addictive riffs I have ever known. Here was no exception.\n\nAs for the variety, songs like \"That Was Just Your Life\", \"The End of The Line\" or \"The Judas Kiss\" feature a palette of many tonalities, not in the \"progressive\" meaning of the term, but in a way avoid repetition, almost as in the fashion of Megadeth's \"Holy Wars\" (but not so good, HAHAHA! Chill out!).\n\nI think Kirk has good taste. This is not cooking, but good taste is also very important in music. Often more easily I praise a not-so-gifted guitarist compared to some virtuoso, if he has the ability to tailor his solos to the music he's playing, if you know what I mean (Jerry Cantrell, anyone?). Kirk plays some solos that, although they are not the most complex, they manage to fit perfectly in the songs. I assume he's comfortable playing a kind of blues scale all the time, hastening it to gain the taste of metal. Skilled? No. Clever? Certainly! Unfortunately, he was unable to maintain this ability on the next album, but that's another story (and I'm not talking about lost smartphones ...). But Kirk seems to be a good guy, so if you never really cared, here are a few highlights of him: \"The Unforgiven III\" and \"Cyanide\" leads / solos.\n\nStill speaking of the band's performance, I do not think Lars deserves to be bashed, since he keeps up the pace, doing a good job, especially, I think, in \"The End of the Line.\" Trujillo can be heard, but I do not find his bass lines in any way extraordinary. Recalling again that idea of being \"Death Magnetic\" a summary of Metallica's career, this idea rests on two pillars: the build-up of some songs and the addition, on the same album, of elements that were given importance in different moments of their career, I imagine.\n\nAs for the first (and clearly I am not the first to note ...), the affinity between \"Blackened\" and \"That Was Just Your Life\" or \"Fade to Black\" and \"The Day That Never Comes\" is obvious, as well as I think the groove of the self-titled album can be found all over \"Cyanide\" or \"Broken Beat and Scarred,\" which is tempered with some bits of a \"modernized\" type of sound (not to be confused with mallcore) and splashes of St. Anger's roughness in the crude approach to the structure of songs. Even \"The Judas Kiss\" can be described in my eyes as the bastard son of \"Kill 'Em All\" and \"Load\"! Can you imagine both together? Apparently, Metallica thinks so. \n\nThere are some confusing moments, though and I really do not know if the final result would be better or worse without them. For instance, \"The Unforgiven III\": a silly title for a good, but somewhat misplaced song. This is the kind of music that belongs to the mid-90's Metallica, but probably not here. This is a standout track with an almost irresistible atmosphere, taking the \"Load\" / \"ReLoad\" heritage and blending it with a great vocal performance and great lead guitars (plus another reviewer, am I the only one who considers this song an Ennio Morricone kind of tribute here?). However, the final impression is that Death Magnetic does not try to tell stories, it's not about creating moods or blinking for epics (by Metallica standards). Sometimes I feel like \"The Unforgiven III\" should exist (as great song as it is), but change its place with one of the \"Beyond Magnetic\" four songs.\n\nContinuing with the same idea, they even have an instrumental (\"Suicide and Redemption\") - not memorable, not boring, just okay - but Metallica should not be content for just being ok. With great power comes great responsibility (WOW! That sounds good!) And as a driving force, they should know to protect themselves a little more.\n\nThis leads me to refer to their skills as composers. Oh my... don't you learn? Shorter songs and shorter albums will save you work, time, patience, money and keep your fans happier and more interested in your work. Not all the songs have to take 5 minutes or more! And if so, you have to have \"juice\" to fill them! This is, in my opinion, the main fault of Metallica since a long time. Apart from production, the restriction on composition could have been a kind of saving grace for St. Anger. The same here. Sometimes you are prompted to advance to the next song or to fast-forward some parts. Even being masters of hooks (and that's a big credit to Metallica), you need to know when to stop. The length of some songs ranges from \"unbearable\" (\"The End of the Line\", \"All Nightmare Long\", \"The Judas Kiss\") to \"ridicule\" (\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\", \"Suicide & Redemption\"). Even so, we should praise and welcome thrashers involved in a (kind of) \"progressive\" structure like \"My Apocalypse\" and \"All Nightmare Long\"\n\nDeath Magnetic will never be anyone's favorite album. It will never be \"the\" return to form (or whatever you want to call it). It will never suck entirely. It's a great bridge to the next record, where Metallica would have to face (again) one of the biggest challenges of their life: where to go when you've achieved both excellence and mediocrity in the eyes of people and still not thinking about retirement?\n\nHighlights (but not flawless): \"That Was Just Your life\", \"All Nightmare Long\", \"The Judas Kiss\", \"The Unforgiven III\".\n",
        "\nThe infamous St. Anger. Legendary for being one of the worst metal albums of all time put out by one of the pioneers of thrash metal: Metallica. But how bad is it really?\n\nWell, it starts off with some heavy riffage straight out of an old school metalcore song. It almost sounds like Integrity. We even get some decent lyrics. But then, James Hetfield drops this gem: \"My lifestyle, determines my death style.\" The moment he says that, the song goes to shit. We get some bland riffs, weak singing and the quality of the lyrics take an incredible nose dive in quality. Something's off.\n\nActually, the entire album takes a nose dive in quality after that line in Frantic. The next track being one of the worst examples. The title track has a heavy System Of A Down influence, but this influence, instead of sounding left field or progressive, sounds like a hollow and cheap imitation with atrocious lyrics (\"I'm madly in anger with you!\"). What follows is a series of Pantera rip offs with some okay intro riffs and not much else to offer. Save for Shoot Me Again which has this cheesy nu metal feel. It's trash. It sounds like a 5FDP song and that is not good because 5FDP is shit enough. Why you would want to actively imitate garbage is beyond me. This has to be the worst Metallica song. I will say though that Dirty Window is pretty thrashy, the lyrics are the best on the album (not saying much, I know) and it's probably the closest to a good song on the album. The groove metal feel continues on the next few tracks. Which start off again with okay riffs and grooves but are destroyed by terrible vocals and lyrics. They also reek of more SOAD influence with some terrible drum performances.\n\nCan we talk about the lyrics some more? They suck. It's pretty disappointing considering James has written songs like Fade To Black, One, For Whom The Bell Tolls, and Harvester of Sorrow. He's proven himself to be an amazing lyricist in the past. What happened? This is beneath him.\n\nYou know, this could have been okay, but one thing ruins what little this album had in terms of positives. The production is god awful. The mixing is terrible. The drums are so poorly produced. Half the time, they are too quiet. The bass is even quieter. The guitars and vocals are blaring. Everything sounds so separate. The worst is this one noisy guitar lead on Some Kind Of Monster that sounds completely out of place. It sounds like it was ripped from an early Black Rebel Motorcycle Club song and dumped in Metallica's Pantera cover. The production is so muddy and gross and disgusting in all the wrong ways. If they wanted a raw sound, they should've gotten Steve Albini or Kurt Ballou instead of Bob Rock, who is most known for doing hair metal like Motley Crue and Bon Jovi and wouldn't know raw if he was slapped in the face with uncooked meat. It sounds so unfinished, it's distracting.\n\nAnother huge problem is the drum sound. Lars' infamous snare sound on this album, it's terrible. Turning off the snares left the drums ringing way too much and it sounds like someone threw a basket ball at a trash can every time. And I know that Lars was never a very technically proficient drummer but his playing on this album sounds like an angry monkey banging on a bunch of scrap metal.\n\nAnother elephant in the room is the lack of Kirk Hammett solos. It really doesn't bother me that there is a lack of guitar solos on this album. It would have been nice to have them just to add more sonic variety, but they aren't necessary here. Kirk is not the greatest guitar player in the world. Besides, this style of metal isn't as built for solos as your average thrash sound. I'm not gonna dock them too many points for that. I can dock them for not having a whole lot of variety. Metallica records usually have way more variety. Throttling speed metal bangers, mesmerizing instrumentals, slower, heavier songs that are still bangers, sad, emotional ballads. Here we don't have that. Virtually every song is a banger with fast, slow and quiet sections. It all starts to sound the same after a while. On top of that, at 11 tracks in 75 minutes, this album is way too long. Many of these tracks are incredibly bloated and repetitive. Pretty much every song longer than 6 minutes could've been cut down and both the songs and the album as a whole would've flowed better. Sweet Amber and Dirty Window I'd say is probably the closest to good songs on this album. Shoot Me Again and St. Anger are probably the worst. Overall, it was too long, underwritten, poorly produced and just messy. This album fails on every conceivable level and has no reason to be. There are some riffs and breakdowns that are semi-okay but the muddy production, the ridiculous lyrics and the trash can drum sound pull away from anything this album could've had in terms of positives. This album had a very troubled production cycle with James in rehab, the lack of a bassist and internal struggles in the band and with the producer. It shows. This album does not sound like a focused project. It sounds like an overblown half finished mess that constantly rips off Pantera and SOAD. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned. 1/10\n",
        "\nFor a long time, people have waited for a new album from Metallica, most feeling satisfied with their 2008 release, Death Magnetic. But finally they have released a new record. Here is my review on Hardwired... to Self-Destruct.\n\nStarting with \"Hardwired\" which was released a year ago today, I first watched this when I heard about it on social media. I watched and listened, and I thought I could already tell how great of an album this was going to be. The short 3 minute track was the first little taste the band gave to the world publicly since their previous album. I did enjoy the fact that Lars did return to using a crash/ride for some the parts on this song. \"Now That We're Dead\", the first butcher of the album I believe. Although for the most part, the song is decent and it is a great song to hear live when the band uses taiko drums on stage, but the thing that made it a little hard to listen to, at least for me, was the 16th notes on the toms that Lars does. Didn't seem like an obvious genius thing to come up with and lasted too long for it's life.\n\nNow for a higher level song like \"Moth Into Flame\". Released as the second single on September 26th, I specifically remember getting in trouble at school for hearing this the day it was released for having my phone out and then defiantly saying to my teacher, \"Fuck off, I'm listening to a new Metallica song.\" Probably has the best Kirk solo on the album, although I also like \"ManUNkind\"s solo as well. \"Halo On Fire\". Holy jumping bagel balls, if they couldn't do a better song while thinking about \"The Outlaw Torn\", one of my favorites ever. They make this very interesting in that its dynamics are very powerful when they switch between the verse and chorus. They also have the awesome other half of the song, which also appeals heavily due to its similarity to \"The Outlaw Torn\" which I mentioned wherein the other half is very different feeling and yet still connecting to the first half.\n\n\"Murder One\" caught my interest in that the intro was extremely similar to \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\". Like \"Halo On Fire\", does a great deal with dynamics and overall power. It's like they combined the intros of \"Sanitarium\" and \"...And Justice For All\". Great lyrics as well, attributing towards it's music video with Lemmy as a character.\n\nFinally, the closing song \"Spit Out The Bone\". This was actually that last song I heard from the early releases, but absolutely failed to disappoint. This is as close as they could ever get, nowadays, to going back to the late 80s. Power and feel is incredible and lyrical subject matter is very inspiring. The main riff is also, I believe the golden riff of this whole album. It shows outstandingly how they still got a few tricks up their sleeves, so when and if they release a new album, maybe they'll add something that hasn't been thought of and yet is very powerful, just like their \"Die!\" section of \"Creeping Death\".\n\nThe tone of James' and Kirk's guitars were similar to that of Death Magnetic, but it lacked that sort of beehive-sounding kinda thing which isn't better or worse when they explore a new sound. Lars' drums sounded a little different from their other albums, in that I noticed, especially on \"Halo On Fire\", that his snare drum sounds the same every time he hits it. Confirmed when I saw them in Seattle (Saw a trigger). His bass drum was clicky, which I don't care for that much but it is tolerable and his toms sounded like paper. Seriously, he should do some work there.\n\nBut Robert's bass tone and accuracy stood out to me. I think he owned these songs just by creating a huge low end and supporting everybody and he got to do an intro on \"ManUNkind\" something that is quite rare in Metallica's discography. \n\nAnd that is my review for my 2nd favorite album by Metallica. Thank you for reading.\n",
        "\nFollowing the passing of their longtime bassist, Cliff Burton, and the trilogy of thrash masterpieces that he was featured on, many were skeptical as to whether Metallica could emerge from that tumultuous time to top or even match their already legendary discography. Alongside their new bassist, Jason Newsted of Flotsam and Jetsam, Metallica silenced these fears with a masterpiece of an album entitled \"...And Justice For All\", that, instead of mimicking the styles of their previous works, takes on its own, extremely unique identity. The songs are longer, the riffs are more technical and the composition is more intricate, leading to the album being commonly labelled \"progressive thrash metal\". This album certainly takes more getting used to than their previous offerings, but that only makes it all the more rewarding on repeated listens, as it allows the listener to decipher the winding song structures and bleak lyrical themes.\n\nThe standout performance on this album undoubtedly comes from the dual guitars of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett; Hetfield's riffs are razor sharp and precise, while Hammett's leads are chaotic and technical. Furthermore, many of the songs on this album include sections in which the guitars harmonize beautifully to give the songs a more dynamic feel. The album opener, \"Blackened,\" which is also one of the album's best tracks, provides a perfect example of the stellar guitar work. A backwards guitar intro builds into a ferocious main riff; one of the best riffs of the band's entire career. Halfway through the song, the guitars harmonize before Hammett rips into a fast, vicious and technically impressive solo. The sound of the guitars throughout the album is extremely thick, making this Metallica's most dark and crushingly heavy sounding album. \n\nDespite all the criticism he receives, Lars Ulrich lays down a solid drum performance throughout the album. While his technical prowess can't compete with the guitar work of Hetfield and Hammett, he supports them with a steady performance, and even has a fair few moments in which he exhibits technicality, such as the lightning fast thrasher, \"Dyer's Eve\".\n\nVocally and lyrically, this is one of Hetfield's best performances ever; his voice is far more gruff and hostile than on previous albums, which once again contributes to the darker feel and theme of this album. Every lyrics sounds as if it is yelled with anger and hatred, giving the album an almost cathartic feel. Lyrically, the dark, serious themes support the vocal delivery. This is perhaps Hetfield's best lyrical performance, and while his lyrics on other albums fall flat (looking at you, St. Anger), they undoubtedly succeed here. Both the title track as well as the aforementioned \"Dyer's Eve\" exhibit Hetfield's angry lyrics and spiteful delivery in full flight.\n\nThe aspect of this album that is most often criticized is its production; namely, the lack of bass guitar. While the bass guitar is definitely buried in the mix to a point where it is barely decipherable, this doesn't hurt the album at all. In fact, it gives the album an incredibly dry, bleak sound which fits the dark lyrical themes of the album, thus enhancing the overall experience. Sure, the lack of bass initially gives the impression of a less dynamic album and makes it harder to listen to, but upon repeated listens, the sterile sound it creates only serves to build atmosphere and complement the anger that is presented in the lyrics.\n\nThis album rewards the listener who keeps coming back. While \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Ride the Lightning\" seem to be far more dynamic records on the first listen, \"...And Justice For All\" exhibits the bands most creative songwriting and riffs, and, in my opinion, upon repeated listens, surpasses the majesty of the aforementioned releases. A true thrash masterpiece; the last the band would ever create.\n\nStandout Tracks: \"Blackened\", \"...And Justice for All\", \"One\", \"Harvester of Sorrow\", \"Dyer's Eve\"\n",
        "\nWhat was this thing? Did even Lou Reed and Metallica know? I don't.\n\nSo Lulu is the bizarre and unexpected collaboration between Lou Reed and Metallica that has no reason to be. Reed and the guys were probably sitting around getting wasted and thought this would be a funny joke. Metallica fans would hate it because Lou Reed doesn't do heavy shit and Lou Reed fans would hate it because Metallica is too mainstream and they only listen to the avant garde.\n\nI guess that's the unfortunate thing about this album. This could have been really experimental and interesting. We could have gotten a super whacked out metal record in ostrich tuning with Lou Reed singing on it. Instead we get these long drawn out tracks where Reed just complains over a repetitive metal beat. There's almost no point in reviewing each individual track because pretty much every track is just spoken word metal. That's it. It just wants to be a metal version of White Light/White Heat without the dark comedy.\n\nIf you listen to Lou Reed, you know what to expect with lyrics about sex, growing old, power, gore and love. It is pretty standard Lou Reed fare. It has some interesting ideas. Little Dog tells an interesting tale about being washed up sexually as you get old. The View talks about being hated while Dragon brings it full circle with lyrics about worshipping the people you hate. Some of the abstract lyricism warrants eye rolls (I AM THE TABLE) but overall, Reed does throw some interesting ideas out there.\n\nMusically there are a few heavy riffs here and there. Cheat On Me, Mistress Dread and Dragon do actually have some badass instrumentals. I feel like they get a little stale just because of the length of the tracks, but overall, not bad. Lou Reed's voice kinda kills it a little. Age didn't do his voice any favors. The production on the album isn't much to ride home about. It doesn't piss me off, but it doesn't blow me away. Most of the tracks are super repetitive and get pretty boring after a while. It sounds like a bunch of Metallica demos that weren't rehearsed or refined. Junior Dad is easily the worst track with its obnoxious strings and ridiculous 20 minute runtime. The song becomes the masterbatory garbage that stuff like heavy metal, punk rock and noise rock were created to counteract.\n\nThis album basically just sounds like Mark Kozelek started a cut rate heavy metal band. I like the idea of this album, but the execution is weak. It overstays its welcome at 80 minutes. The track Junior Dad could have been cut and the album would have flowed ten times better. That track is a 20 minute waste of time that only exists to fill side 4 of the inevitable vinyl edition. The album could have been an avant garde masterpiece but the messy execution just makes it pretentious garbage. If they put more effort in, they could've had something.\n\nInstead this album reads like a troll. Lou Reed is certainly not above releasing troll albums. Metal Machine Music comes to mind. 64 minutes of guitar droning that left the public and critics confused and frustrated. That shit was funny and the album makes for great background noise in my opinion. And this album, I believe, is more of the same. Lou Reed and Metallica trolling their fanbases. Lou Reed's fans are gonna hate this because they are above radio rock garbage like Metallica. Metallica fans are gonna hate Lou Reed because this art rock stuff is just pretentious trash that isn't heavy. Come to think of it, the entire album just doesn't give a fuck. It sounds like a bunch of unrehearsed demo tracks. This entire album just has an aesthetic of failure. I can't even call it so bad it's good because the closing track just drags it through the mud until it's just walking filth. It fails on every conceivable level and I think it was supposed. This album makes a statement, and that statement is \"We don't care.\" I like it better than St. Anger because this album at least has some artistic merit over that mess. And I gotta give props to Metallica for doing something different on this album whereas St. Anger just chased the alternative metal trends of the time. That being said, this album is still not good. The idea of this album is way more interesting than the actual physical album we got. Lou Reed and Metallica didn't care, and neither do I. 2/10\n",
        "\n\"All Nightmare Long\" is one of the singles from Metallica's 2008 comeback album \"Death Magnetic\". Overall, this album tends to mix the band's 1980s brand of thrash metal and somewhat of a modern heavy metal sound. \"All Nightmare Long\" is one of the more aggressive tracks from the record, and really showcases how the band was/is still perfectly capable of writing great thrash metal.\n\nThe song begins with a bit of a dark sounding riff, almost foreboding as well. Such as the case with a good deal of Metallica tracks, notably on this album but also from plenty of their 80s tracks, the intro is quite long, almost reaching the two-minute mark. The song itself is around 8 minutes long so this really comes as no surprise. The song has its fair share of solos and really killer thrash riffs, with one of the greatest riffs Metallica has ever written following the first solo, then segueing into the second guitar solo. \n\nLars' drumming is standard at this point. It's full of galloping drum patterns found in both thrash and punk music, which has been a formulaic ingredient in Metallica's music prior to the self-titled album. I'm not gonna say Lars is at his best here because he certainly is not. But it gets the job done. Really, the only complaint I'd have about this song, as well as a lot of the tracks on \"Death Magnetic\" is James' voice. The production really doesn't help this case. His vocals are not mixed well and tend to be overbearing at times but really, it's a small detractor. \n\nThis is easily one of the greatest songs the band wrote since 1988 although \"Hardwired...to Self-Destruct\" has some tracks that definitely outdo this one. I'd stick by this being the best song from \"Death Magnetic\".\n",
        "\nWell, my first review ever in this page. I hope it's the first of many.\n\nAnd with that random fact I lead to the important issue. Metallica needs no introduction at this point: every single metal fan knows who they are, why so many seem to hate them, and the special fixation with anything they release from 1991 onwards, which is always seen under critical eyes and, let's be honest here, their approaches and movements, concerning to music, imaging, or such, are not regarded, for a long time now, the same way than other bands' are. I'm not going to get deep into the reasons of why this happens, since I could be talking all day long and write a doctoral essay, and besides, my opinion is biased too, for the same reasons others think the opposite than me about Metallica.\n\nSo, with that said, let me state the next: coming from a Metallica fan that likes all their albums except St. Anger (it's probably the only album I agree with popular opinion about it), and just like 100% of reviews anyway, I'm not objective at all, so, in case you're the type of person described in the above paragraph, feel free to skip this review if you want to get informed properly about the new album, as you'll feel we have an 180\u00ba opposite conception about \"new\" Metallica, which will finally end up with your time wasted reading this just to disagree in almost everything I say. I'm not gonna try to convince anyone at this point about the goodness of Metallica 'cause, first of all, we all have our opinion, and second, it's a lost battle so far: this album, and let alone my biased fan review, won't change any minds here: those who enjoyed Death Magnetic and \"new\" Metallica overall will keep doing so, and those who don't and think anything post-Justice is not good, won't move from their original though either. Whatever your opinion is, if you decided to stay, welcome and thank you! Here we go.\n\nFirst of all, if I had to use a word to describe Hardwired... To Self-Destruct, that'd be diverse. The album doesn't focus on a specific genre style, which makes it hard to define who is this appealing to. Some people, specially if you're looking for old school thrash, won't approve it, but I rather consider it an advantage than a flaw from the Metallica unconditional fan point of view: this album feels like all their previous mixed in one. On the wrong side, this diversity tends to make it a bit dull for a full-time listening, as you may choose specific songs that fit your actual mood rather than listening to the whole thing in one round. But overall, the mix blends pretty nicely and the songs are places in a way you don't feel any letdown, except maybe near the ending in between Here Comes Revenge and Spit Out the Bone, with two slow tempo songs in the middle, for those who seek faster and more aggresive pace.\n\nTalking about instrumental section itself, I have to say the production here is much neater and polished than in Death Magnetic. One of Death Magnetic worst flaws, that downgraded overall quality, was the ugly, sinking mixing, that didn't let room to appreciate the many technical riffs and passages without a close-up listening. This problem has been solved here. As far as song structure goes, HTSD represents a change from Death Magnetic too: DM had a new wave thrashier feeling all the way through it, with many changing moments rather than straightforward old school thrash. Songs here have (overall) a more simplistic riffage outcome and structures, thrash or not, but somehow they flow and fit together better and more naturally than in DM. I don't have the feeling it's forced or a bit out of the key, as in some moments there. Said that, Spit Out the Bone itself feels like one of their best implemented and polished songs ever, nothing to envy to classics like Dyers' Eve, Creeping Death, Metal Militia... it's up there with them, at least. James singing has improved from previous efforts, he doesn't tend to abuse \"yeah\" as many times as he could. I believe his voice wasn't gone really, just that he changed his style maybe thanks to Bob Rock indications. Not like I can complain. About riffing, nothing I haven't said already: more simplistic songs overall, but better glued as a whole, and not exempt of technical moments anyway, specially in the aforementioned Spit out the Bone. It's hard to dislike the heavy informality of songs like Now That We're Dead, the creepiness of Dream No More (Devil's Dance + The Thing That Should not Be) or the infectious riffs of Confusion and, more specially, Here Comes Revenge. Those represent the best what I'm talking about. Bass feels more audible than before too, it's nothing remarkable though, neither for good nor bad this time. And now comes the time to analyse the two most controversial moments: lead guitar and drums. Well, Kirk Hammett, at this point, you can't expect him doing anything different than he's ever do, can you? We all now he loves pentatonic scale. However, this time he selects more properly the moments whether to use or not the wah pedal. His soloing here feels better and more clean than in DM, with some more than decent moments like in Murder One, Am I Savage?, Dream No More, ans specially, Halo on Fire. That has to be one of his best solos ever. On the other hand, ManUnkind solo is one of his lamest and dullest ever. But balance is overall more positive than negative, besides, he lost his iPhone with many previous ideas... who knows what would've happened if that had never happened. And finally, to end this loooong-ass paragraph, Lars. His drumming skills are... I let that up to you, but regardless, one has to admit he fits the band perfectly, and I believe his drumming here is his best in a while (how to forget the terrible garbage can from St. Anger?), with many double bass lines too. I'm even a bit impressed on how well he dealt with Spit Out the Bone, but I'm still waiting for it to be performed live. Some details like the built-up in Now That We're Dead are much appreciated too. \n\nAbout the songs. As I said a few paragraphs above, they don't follow an specific stylistic pattern. You have all their previous eras mixed in one, that's the best way to describe this album. Regarding this heterogeneity, it's up to you to decide whether you like it or not, as it can be a bit confusing and mood-changing at times (for example, it's hard to feel as comfortable as someone could expect listening to Am I Savage? right after Hardwired or Spit Out the Bone). There are 3 major song groups here: pure thrash metal with old school riffage (Hardwired, Spit Out the Bone), heavier and sometimes hard-rocking Load reminiscent era (Murder One, Am I Savage?, Dream No More), and then those mixing old school with Black Album style, which are hard to catalogue in an specific genre, the biggest one (Now That' We're Dead, which is rather Black Album heavy than thrash and is a bit different from the rest in this group, Atlas, Rise!, which has an Iron Maiden signature, Moth Into Flame, Here Comes Revenge, Confusion). And then, we have ManUnkind, which is a bit difficult to fit in any of these groups. It has this Black Sabbath feeling all the way, yet it seems too heavy and faster to be in Load era. It felt a big flop the first time listening to it, but it grows on you after a while. And then, we have Halo on Fire, typical Metallica ballad, with similar progression, from calm to storm, like One, Fade to Black, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), or The Day That Never Comes. But boy, what a ballad! It has to be one of their best ever. There's nothing negative I can say about that song.\n\nSo, in the end, I believe this to be a good album, with some flawed moments and more straightforward than Death Magnetic, but with an honest, better flow all the way through, and the polished simplicity I perceive in most of Metallica's catalogue, with some very reminding old school moments, and some winks to their most controversial era, if we exclude St. Anger. But, as I said before, this won't change anyone minds: those who want to like it, will like it, and those who despise everything Metallica has done since 1988, likewise. After all, this is only my personal opinion about how I take this album, and needless to say there's no way (and it's not my goal in any case) to convince those old fans that jumped off the bandwagon a long time ago sometime in the 90's. For those new fans or those who are still in the train, relax and take a gentle listen to this record, little by little. It takes a bit of time to appreciate the stylistic diversity all at once, but I'm sure with time it'll grow on you.\n\nStandout tracks: Spit Out the Bone, Here Comes Revenge, Halo On Fire.\n",
        "\nSo this is it, the infamous eponymous effort from the band we all love to hate. Some things should be cleared up immediately - this is a sellout by the band (one of the few times that's really applicable, to be honest) and this did kill off thrash completely (but the bloating it suffered towards the end of the '80s was the major factor behind that.) However, selling out is a fairly minor sin by my judgement given that the music is the most important part of an album, and really an album can't be blamed for others imitating it because it isn't as if another band *has* to change style in the wake of a commercial behemoth such as this. No, this album's flaws rest entirely on its restraint and lack of ambition.\n\nAs the cover art and album title symbolise, this album is very much geared towards simplification and minimalism, and at every turn this album is scaled down from its predecessor. Take for instance the drumming - Lars was at his peak around the last album with at least a smattering of more complex drum patterns, fills and double bass, whereas here his performance consists of simpler straight beats. The soloing has been toned down in technicality as well, with Hammett relying more on the wah pedal and having shorter slots to fit the shorter songs. The riffs for the most part are no longer highly aggressive or technical in the mould of their first 3 albums or droning and monolithic as was the case with ...and Justice for All, rather they take on a highly simplified heavy/groove metal character with only a handful of riffs per song. While I can appreciate that all of this was done as they couldn't take the sound of ...and Justice for All any further, it feels as though the band plays it a bit too safe with most of the material, and this shows at just about every turn. The album never really surprises or challenges the listener akin to the more aggressive, thought-provoking and intelligent works, and more importantly the band members never really challenge themselves either.\n\nThis restraint also becomes apparent when the song structures and progressions are considered. Just about every single song is built upon a verse-chorus structure with no variation in this regard, and it's clear that the hook is the focus of any given song. While it again would have been better if the band members had stretched themselves a bit more in this regard, the album doesn't get stale as to their credit every single hook on this album and the vast majority of the riffs are memorable. At the same time however memorability can be attained through either repetition without progression or writing the best possible material, and unfortunately the band lean too heavily on the former, with a lot of songs being developed in a sluggish and flat manner. For example, the hit singles 'Sad But True' and 'Enter Sandman' simply don't have enough musical ideas to justify their 5+ minute running times. The same can be said of 'My Friend of Misery' and perhaps even the acoustic ballad 'Nothing Else Matters', though the latter does have a rather touching feel to it and a superb solo from James. On his vocal performance - it is one of the only elements on this album that isn't a considerable regression or otherwise mediocre. He retains most of the grit and bite to his voice but also deals with a fair amount of more standard singing which is pulled off well on a technical level - and as the ballads show his voice can be rather emotive as well.\n\nIn fact, it's songs like 'Nothing Else Matters', 'Wherever I May Roam' and especially 'The Unforgiven' that highlight the flaws of this album more than anything else. These three songs (as well as 'The God that Failed') all feature fairly strong atmospheric qualities, with 'Wherever I May Roam' being an epic even by Metallica standards, and through these songs one can realise that this album is the first by Metallica to not have an overriding atmosphere throughout, which was present in spades on the last 4 releases. They do shoot for a darker feel across the album through the production, lyrics and sense of melody, and while there are flashes of this at points a lot of the material isn't quite well written, ambitious or convincingly performed enough to really have an atmosphere in the way the aforementioned tracks do. It is also with these songs that one gets the sense that the band did the best that they could when writing them, which isn't true of a lot of the other songs. This album is not a consistent listen, and a few tracks like the rather plain 'Holier Than Thou' could have easily been dropped to make it a more memorable and concise listening experience. The combination of being midtempo largely throughout and primarily being composed of simple, groovy riffs leaves variation at something of a premium, with about a third of this album's tracks not really standing out in any particular way and not having enough of a personality to live up to the legacy of Metallica.\n\nDespite me largely thrashing this album though, the band certainly did succeed in one department - solely as a piece of entertainment this is a well done and functional album. On a technical level the band never skips a beat, every single song is enjoyable while it is on (until one starts to think about the repetition or safeness of the material) and the production is perfect. I've never heard a metal album with such phenomenal production - everything on this album sounds crisp, as heavy as an anvil and full of life. If only such perfectionism could have been applied to the material, because as it is this album is the sound of an artist not being the best they could be and while it ticks most of the boxes it also reeks of wasted potential. It's an important release for sure, and it's not bad by any stretch, but it is fairly disappointing.\n",
        "\nWhether you absolutely adore them or flat out hate them, Metallica is one of the most important bands in the history of metal, more particularly in thrash metal. You could say they're the Black Sabbath of American thrash metal, although the other 3 bands in the Big 4 would beg to differ, ESPECIALLY Megadeth. This album is a fucking metal CLASSIC, and it's not hard to see why. Almost everyone who is a Metallica fan has at least heard of the debut and of course listened to it. This isn't their best work, though. This album basically brought metal to the masses and blew the doors off their fucking hinges that would later result in a MASSIVE increase of metal bands. No longer was metal \"underground\" like it was in the 70s, now it was taking over the mainstream in the 80s alongside classic 80s artists like Bon Jovi, Heart, Journey, Foreigner, David Bowie, and perhaps even U2.\n\nFirst off, the album cover. Pretty simple, and that's all this 1983 beast of an album needs to send its message across and get its overall atmosphere cemented. The cover depicts a hand dropping a mallet hammer that lands in a pool of blood that for some reason, why I personally look at it, it looks like a little angel just sitting and thinking. I'm being serious. Anyone else see that? Anyway, the title itself, Kill 'Em All, was suggested by Cliff Burton himself after the band got worked up over the producers of the studio they talked to tried to change the album in some way. (As if the fact that they recorded it in a shitty studio building wasn't hard enough.) Cliff said, \"Fuck the producers. We should just kill 'em all!\" Hetfield liked the title and they decided to go with it.\n\nNext up is the instrumentation. I'll admit, it sounds a little amateurish nowadays because of the rough instrumentation and the fact that James Hetfield couldn't properly sing (one of the main reasons I imagine has to do with the 5-year hiatus in between the Black Album and Load, which was where they started going downhill) makes any non-metalhead get a bad impression on even the basics of the genre. Anyway, the guitars are just classic Metallica, and from a critical perspective, they're actually pretty good. The solos are BLINDINGLY fast, thanks to Kirk Hammett, and I dare say this album probably improved the speed metal sound used by Judas Priest and Mot\u00f6rhead years earlier. Personally, the openings of \"Jump In the Fire\", \"Hit the Lights\", and even \"The Four Horsemen\" are some of my absolute FAVORITES and pretty much my favorites on this album in general. However, I think \"Phantom Lord\" is a bit laughable.\n\nThe bass, courtesy of the late Cliff Burton, is really good, too. Cliff gets to show off his bass skills on \"Anasthesia (Pulling Teeth)\", in which the only \"lyrics\" are James saying \"Bass solo, take one\". The instrumental is a good one. Cliff basically holds nothing back with this album, and he continues that on Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets before his untimely death in 1986 in Sweden. The drums are just awesome. I honestly think here, Lars Ulrich is putting his whole body into his drumming, unlike on the 2003 abomination that isn't worth mentioning. (Still, even AFTER watching Some Kind of Monster, that's their worst album, in my opinion.) Drumming on this album is pretty much the definition of \"thrash metal\", and you can CLEARLY hear why.\n\nNow, we've gotten past the album cover and instrumentation, and the songwriting process is where people get divided. Yes, we all know about Dave Mustaine contributing to some of the songs on the album, and \"Mechanix\" being renamed \"The Four Horsemen\" after he was fired from the band, but some of the most CLASSIC metal lyrics are found on this album:\n\n\"Scanning the scene in the city tonight\nLooking for you to start up a fight\nThere's an evil feeling in our brains\nYou know it's nothing new, and it drives us insane\"\n(\"Seek & Destroy\")\n\n\"Adrenaline starts to flow!\nYou're thrashing all around\nActing like a maniac!\nWhiplash!\"\n(\"Whiplash\")\n\nI could go on, but I won't, or else this will turn from a review into a short story. Songwriting aside, the production is done quite well, and so is the mixing. All I can say is that this is probably one of the most classic metal albums in existence, right up there with Black Sabbath, British Steel, and Ace of Spades, as well as Reign In Blood and Peace Sells...but Who's Buying?!\n\nOverall, this album is a CLASSIC MASTERPIECE and it's only been 34 years since its release in 1983. The number of bands have SKYROCKETED thanks in part to this album and the band in general.\n\nRating: 9.5/10\nRating: 96/100\n",
        "\nThis album is generally seen as the beginning of the end, for Metallica. An album which marked their more commercialized sound that would forever tarnish a pristine metal giants repetoire. However, despite its flaws I still believe the album holds up reasonably well and doesn't disgrace their catalog. The change of direction from their earlier albums may be unsettling however as Metallica added more melodic elements and slowed down (One) this more 'easy listening' album shouldn't have been a complete surprise. As a whole this is a fun album lacking some of the heart and punch of their earlier works but still an enjoyable listen.\n\nFirst, I'd like to address the fact that this album doesn't hold up against Its predecessors in terms of heaviness. It just isn't as heavy. A lot of the gritty vibe, however, remains present. This is still Metallica and the raw aggression isn't gone, it just isn't as strong. This album takes a very different direction and while seeming more mainstream it is still leagues above more groovy sounding outfits (Disturbed or FFDP) that the mainstream considers metal. This is definitely not Metallica's brutalist album by far, but it isn't LuLu and the songwriting is leagues better than St. Anger.\n\nThe album opens strong with one of my favorite tracks off Load \"Ain't My Bitch\" you can feel the aggression here and it gets the album off to a solid start. Now sadly the album as a whole doesn't get much heavier than this track, yet this particular song still has some nice riffs. After this song it hits a more mediocre step with \"2x4\". \n\nI really like the song \"The House That Jack Built\" but then again I also like George Thorogood and this track isn't a lot heavier than His \"Bad to the Bone\". Thats the thing with this album it honestly sounds like heavy blues rock more so than metal. \"Mama Said\" is another favorite but it isn't at all metal more an acoustic rock sounding song. It is a beautiful touching and most definitely emotional track about James Hetfield's relationship with his mother. You can't say this album has no soul when listening to this particular track. \n\nSome songs like \"King Nothing\" & \"Aint My Bitch\" I believe are worthy of Metallica's metal track list and while not anywhere near their top tunes they are solid songs that would blow you away coming from another band. As for the worse tracks of the album \"Hero of The Day\" and the first half of \"Bleeding Me\" can be retired next to your Hootie and the Blowfish alt rock crap. \n\nThis isn't a bad album, far from it actually. It contains dozens of enjoyable strong songs that are fun to listen too. Ultimately, this isn't the sellout album it is generally accused of being. Rather this work represents a moving more towards a sound, I think, they wanted to hear. This, I think, can be seen in \"Mama Said\" which is only unusual because it is a Metallica song. Yeah, it isn't brutal but it definitely has a working class badass sound. \n\nAs good as I think the album is there are numerous detractors. Holistically this work suffers from a lack of heaviness and over all presence of what you think Metallica should be, metal. So for an album from a pioneer of thrash metal it doesn't live up at all. However, many of the songs have a catchy melodic sound with interesting lyrical content. It isn't necessarily amazing but its pretty darn good. They definitely tried some interesting choices on this album and spiced up their repertoire. While they don't go as out there as \"Sweating Bullets\" from Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction they manage to write interesting solid songs. If you want a Metallica album to destroy a punching bag too this shouldn't be considered. I would Try Kill Em All or Ride the Lighting. If you want a softer version of And Justice For All... to show your girlfriend than this would be great choice. Variety is the spice of life and this album has a ton of it showing Metallica's depth as a band. Finally, for veterans whose jaded ears can only stand pure thrash metal don't listen to it you won't like it, simple as that.\n",
        "\nRemember when Metallica used to actually be good? Back in the day they were a good Metal band that made lots of classics such as Kill Em' All, Ride the Lightning, and Master of Puppets. These albums were actually good, and not stupid like the crap they make today. Cliff Burton then died in a bus accident, and their fourth album was crap compared to these three. And Justice For All had no bass, a dry song, and overly long instrumentals. Their eponymous fifth album, The Black Album, was garbage. It was when Metallica really started to suck, and they went mainstream and abandoned thrash. Load and Reload were even worse than that, with nothing decent, and St. Anger, was horrible. We did see a decent album in 2008, Death Magnetic, but even that was garbage since the production was horrible, and made the songs sound more like mainstream pop rather than good metal.\n\nAfter waiting for 8 years, we get complete shit.\n\nYes, Hardwired... to Self Destruct is probably their WORST album they've made so far, and I never thought anything could be worse than St. Anger, but they've done something so horrible, that nobody should be listening to this garbage. When I heard Hardwired for the first time, I was thinking this would be a great album. Then I saw the weak album cover, and something saying that this album would be more like Load with the sound of Death Magnetic instead of something as good as Kill Em All or Ride the Lightning. Moth Into Flame was just a garbage song proving that they're just a bunch of talentless tryhards who only care about money and being \"Badass\" than actually creating good music. The Production sounded like a modern pop song, and Kirk Hammett's solos are unoriginal and repetitive. He literally just plays a bunch of random riffs or random notes 4x then something else instead of playing an actual solo.\n\nMetallica should've fired Lars Ulrich long ago since he's probably the worst drummer imaginable, and they should've taken away Kirk Hammett's wah pedal and have him make a real solo for once. Then they should've made the album sound more heavy and dark, with an aggressive sound rather than a poppy one. They also should've made faster songs than mainstream songs that belong on the Black Album.\n\nSpeaking of, this album feels way too much like the Black Album. The only main difference is that in the Black Album, we at least had great guitar tones and production, and in this album the sound is horrible. At least in the Black Album they still had some talent. In this album, they just try too hard and proves that they no longer have talent and cannot play good music. This is why Death Magnetic is also crap, and so it St. Anger. Also, a lot of the songs, most notably Now That We're Dead, Dream no More, Confusion, Am I Savage?, and Murder One belong on the Black Album. Here Comes Revenge sounds like a song that would've been better off on Countdown to Extinction, but with Dave Mustaine singing the vocals. Songs like Hardwired, Atlas Rise, Moth into Flame, and even Spit out the Bone, just show that Metallica's new music makes them nothing else but a bunch of thrash metal tryhard wannabes who wanted to make good music but failed miserably.\n\nThe one song that disappointed me the most was Halo on Fire. I was hoping this would be a wonderful song, since it was a ballad and the 80s and Black Album ballads were great, and The Day that Never Comes wasn't bad either. However, the song sucked. The first half of the song with the lyrics was cancerous, and the instrumental which I thought would be good was just mediocre, and nothing good. It is better than The Day That Never Comes, but only because it doesn't sound like some random Jam Session. However, the solo was much worse than all the solos from Death Magnetic which also sucked.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nOverall, this album just generally sucks and is the worst Metallica album to ever exist. Even St. Anger is better, and I do not recommend this album to anyone else. Oh, and remember those horrible lyrics, that went like \"We're so fucked! Shit! Out of luck! Hardwired to self-destruct!\", or \"Stop breathing and dedicate to me. Stop dreaming and terminate for me. All meaning, you dedicate to me. All feelings, you terminate for me.\"? Those lyrics make no sense and are just retarded. Metallica should just give up because they are horrible and can never make good music anymore. Their 11th album will probably be worse than this and they should just call it a day.\n\nThe Pros - There is maybe one or two decent songs on here.\n\nThe Cons - Pretty much everything else about this album, and the fact that once again Metallica tried way too hard to make a good album.\n\nDo not listen to this album. I regret thinking this album would be good.\n",
        "\nMetallica was a painful part of the vocabulary of the author of this review for more than two decades, and may well have been for many others, but it wasn't for any lack of output. The ongoing and seeming consistent stream of studio and live venue failures had piled up to the point of defying any standards of taste, but for some reason people were eating it all up, hence the lack of an incentive for Lars and company to mend their ways. Somewhere between the sad little excuse for a live EP release from the so-called Live Earth concert and the massively over-hyped partial return to form Death Magnetic, these four west coast thrash pioneers decided to take a detour to a smaller venue for a one-time live performance in the basement of a record store in Tennessee, and although the recorded version of this wouldn't surface until a couple years after their 2008 LP, it marks what sounds like an honest attempt at reviving the older glory days.\n\nIn the grand tradition of getting the bad news out of the way first, there are naturally a number of glaring flaws in this performance that bear addressing for posterity's sake. Chief among these is Lars' drumming, which while being performed on a well mixed kit for a live setting, is kinda hit or miss in keeping time on a few spots, and even gets fairly sloppy during the faster areas of the older material (aka the ending of \"No Remorse\" and most of \"Motorbreath\"). To a lesser degree Hetfield's vocals prove to be an occasional liability, as he is still toting that country & western swagger to his voice by keeping things a bit too clean, something which he only recently shed from his approach with the release of Hardwired...To Self-Destruct\". Metallica's insistence on still having one foot planted in the inferior realm of their later 90s output (the Load albums) comes to head with the inclusion of \"Fuel\", which sticks out like a sore thumb among all the material their first 10 years.\n\nBut not withstanding the gaping imperfections in some elements of the performance, this proves to be worlds better than what occurred in London the previous year. Some of it may owe to the venue being a tiny fraction in size compared to a stadium providing better acoustics and less noise from the audience, but the punch of the guitars and Robert Trujillo's chunky bass work is entirely on point and comes fairly close to reliving the sonic power of The Black Album. They play it a bit safe with the song selections, save that there is a heavy representation of Kill Em' All songs on here, including the uncommonly performed \"Motorbreath\", which proves to be quite powerful despite Hetfield's vocals being way too smooth and Lars' inconsistent kit work. Out of the songs rounding out the rest of the set list, \"Harvester Of Sorrow\" and \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" prove to be the most effective, in no small part due to the guitar sound being so well captured during the quiet parts.\n\nThough this is something of a novelty item that is meant to appeal to die hard fans who don't mind having a dozen or so live performances by a single band, this is the only live album other than the \"Big Four\" concert in Bulgaria from the time period between the release of Load and the year 2012 that is worth owning. It's kind of a shame that the band didn't take notice of how well this performance came off in recorded form and applied more of what made these songs great in the first place onto what became Death Magnetic, because they came dangerously close to getting their shit completely back together here.\n",
        "\nOkay first things first, regardless of what most people say, that has to be one of the lamest album titles I've ever heard. From every angle it screams \"We're trying so damn hard to be badass and cool!\". Newsflash: no you're not and it's lame as fuck. I reiterate - Stop trying so damn hard already. Then again, if Metallica had actually just heeded the advice of the previous sentence at the proper time, they certainly wouldn't be where they are right now. I leave you to figure out what I mean by \"the proper time\". Like seriously, 8 years and this is what you guys came up with? A 14 year old could've done better. Sheesh. Seriously just \"Hardwired\" would've actually sounded better as a title, but no matter.\n\nBefore I continue, I honestly have to get this off my chest right now: I'm not really a proper Metallica fan or even a casual one at that, at least not anymore. Sure, we all started off with them and unless you've been living in a cave since birth, you definitely would've heard their first 5-6 (depending on your tastes) albums at least once during your initial phase as a metalhead. No two ways about that. Having said that, I see very few people addressing the main elephant in the room whenever someone brings up the topic of their new albums having a going-back-to-their-roots (i.e thrash) approach, which is - even as a pure thrash metal band back in the 80s, they never were that good at all. Yes I can already see the arm hair of a lot of metalheads around the world rising up in rage, but seriously that's a damn fact whether you like it or not. I have yet to meet a single thrash metal fan who has actually said \"Dude, Metallica was one of the best thrash metal bands of the 80s\". That's sure as hell not happened to me so far and there's probably a damn good reason for that. \n\nIf you actually happen to agree with that statement, then clearly you've got a lot more to listen and learn about thrash. Just a hard fact, my friend. Then again, people who are just casual fans of the genre might think that to be true but nonetheless. Sure they were good, but not THAT good. On the whole, I think it's safe to say that they were more of a gateway band to thrash, before the fans started listening to more extreme forms of the genre. In terms of sheer intensity and innovative musicality, Metal Church, Megadeth, Coroner, Morbid Saint, Testament, Forbidden, Annihilator, Watchtower, Anthrax, Slayer, Overkill, Kreator, Sepultura and literally countless other thrash metal bands were kicking the living shit out of them back in the day. I mean, I consider myself quite the casual fan of thrash and I happen to dig all those bands in the previous sentence. Just let that sink in for a while. In the meantime if you're still simmering with anger at my statement about Metallica being overrated as fuck, how about actually checking out just 2-3 bands in that list (if you haven't already) and then getting back to reading? You might just see what I mean. \n\nLet's face it, back in the day Metallica just happened to have some absurd luck on their side plus the \"being in the right place at the right time\" syndrome, not to mention trend-hopping to the very end. Don't believe me? When thrash dropped out of the radar in the early 90s, they released the commercial black album. When blues and country music became popular again in the mid-90s, they released Load and Re-Load. When nu-metal was at its peak with bands like Slipknot and Korn having released their breakthrough albums in 2003, they released St. Anger. Still not noticing a pattern here? Yeah enough fans will probably go on about how it's just coincidence (like seriously, you expect me to believe that ALL those changes in musical styles were mere coincidence?? Who the heck are you kidding already?) and nonsensical crap that I should be more open-minded, but in all seriousness, that fake attitude towards writing and composing music that is solely in line with the trends of the times and not the music that actually comes from your very heart and soul has pretty much always been Metallica's main problem. Then again, enough fellow reviewers already have pointed that out on numerous occasions. \n\nNow clearly that was a long-ass history lesson that most of you understandably did not care for in the least, but just let me reiterate for the last damn time - The blues and nu-metal didn't come naturally to Metallica at all - they simply made Load and St. Anger because those genres were the trend at the time. When you have a fake attitude towards writing music, it most certainly shows in the final product and much as I hate to say it, that is exactly what the main problem of this album is. It just sounds so dead, sterile and fake, like the band really didn't enjoy making this album whatsoever, but tried their darn hardest to actually make you believe otherwise. Nope. Sorry fellas, but you're definitely not fooling me with that one. It's more like they're playing balls-out thrash metal once again simply because that's what most people have been expecting of them for so long rather than genuinely wanting to play thrash again. \n\nAnd that brings me to the most damning point of all - Metallica have literally become a parody of themselves, or to put it more subtly - their own cover band, which in case you haven't figured out already, isn't exactly the biggest compliment out there. One can argue the fact of that being the case with pretty much every old-school thrash band today like Megadeth or Kreator for example since thrash is more one-dimensional compared to other metal genres, but seriously Dystopia and Phantom Antichrist most certainly don't sound like a rip-off of Rust In Peace or Coma Of Souls, for that matter. The album opens with some standard fare chugging that every thrash/groove band on the face of this planet has done to death by now, along with some golden lyrics of course - \n\nWe're so fucked\nShit out of luck\nHardwired to self destruct\n\nYeah whatever. And mind you - that's just a snippet of all the lyrical gems in store for your ears. Rest assured, there isn't a shortage of cringe-worthy lyrics at every turn which I'm certainly not going to get into at the moment. Seriously go right ahead and take your pick with any of the songs. And Hetfield's nasal voice being even more weak than ever certainly doesn't help matters. Add a boring-ass solo that any guitar beginner could play in their sleep and voila! There you have it - the generic blueprint for every goddamn song Metallica claimed to be a return to their thrash roots. I honestly doubt it would even make a B side to Master Of Puppets, for that matter. Oh and lastly guys - you can't write engaging 8 minute long songs anymore. I mean that fact was established right after the release of Master Of Puppets itself, so let's not even go there. Some thrash bands certainly can, but you are most certainly not one of them. Seriously knock that shit off already. Adding cleans part that don't fit into the song certainly isn't going to win you any prog fans out there. Pretty much every song here could've been at least 2-3 minutes shorter and it would've helped the replay ability factor of the album a great deal. Then again, when have Metallica ever known when to stop? \n\nOh and I have to say, I found Kirk's declaration (a whine fest more like) of having \"Lost 250 riffs\" because his phone malfunctioned or whatever, absolutely hilarious in every sense of the word. That was somewhere around the end of 2014, if I recall correctly. First of all, why the fuck would you whine about that to the world may I ask? Of course, to get some attention clearly or (perhaps) create the buzz that Metallica were creating a prog thrash album. Ha! We all know that one didn't work out. No actually, the real question at hand here is that is your memory that short that you had to literally record every one of those 250 riffs? I mean they're just RIFFS Kirk. I'll be damned. Well if you're not kidding on that front (who even knows), clearly the blame for a mediocre album can be laid squarely on the fact of losing so many riffs/riff ideas. Such a tragedy indeed. Jeez Kirk, and you've been playing the guitar for what, 35-40 years now?? Rather hard to believe considering your riff sob story. Talk about an attention seeker. Here's the thing - No one cares how many riffs you lost, you pentatonic wanking chump. \n\nIt's like they studied every thrash release since the turn of the century and look the most generic and modern elements (clean picking sections before the thrash riffs and after, predictable breakdowns etc.) from each and shaped them into this lumpless mass of an album. Sure they've got their aggressive side back that most fans were missing for a while plus the production is crisp and not to mention miles better than the trainwreck of Death Magnetic, but honestly who the fuck even cares now? There are plenty of kickass re-thrash bands that could beat this album to a pulp in terms of sheer intensity and technicality. This album single handedly proves that there's only a limit to how much you can play straightforward thrash without it getting redundant and Metallica don't (and never did) have the songwriting skills of Sodom, Destruction, Overkill, Anthrax or Kreator to be able to keep playing thrash and still be able to kick your teeth in decades later, nor the intelligent insight of bands like Watchtower, Coroner or Heathen to be able to take their music to more progressive, technical or adventurous realms. So where does that leave an album like Hardwired? Exactly. Absolutely nowhere. Tasteless and generic.\n\nFinal verdict? If you're like me, you'll probably treat this with an indifferent shrug after hearing the singles off YouTube and go back to your usual business. Basically this is the album all the fans plus the critics were expecting them to put out after everyone wrote them off post St Anger. It's certainly not actively bad or offending to the senses, but just plain mediocre in every sense of the word. The perfect epitome of middle-of-the-road or generic, by-the-numbers thrash metal. If you were thinking about there being any standout tracks, kindly allow me to tell you that there really aren't any. Sorry to let you down about that one. I mean sure, if this was playing in the background in my car or at a pals place I certainly wouldn't object but then again, I wouldn't be paying much attention either. If you happen to be a die-hard Metallica fan (yeah, like we don't have enough of those floating around) to the level of actually thinking that Death Magnetic was a good album and a \"killer thrash comeback\" as so many have bizarrely stated, then by all means this album is for you. As for me, I'm more than happy sticking with the new Anthrax, Testament, Vektor and Megadeth (not that new, but still) albums for my yearly thrash fix instead. Make of that what you will.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to, Master of Puppets, it\u2019s either hailed as the greatest thing in existence, or the most overrated piece of crap ever made. I\u2019m supporting the latter, because this is indeed, a very overrated album. This album feels and plays just like its predecessor, Ride The Lightning, but without its intensity, and it was certainly one of the turning points for the band. Dave Mustaine, of Megadeth, was infamously booted out of Metallica, and without that extra wheel, they couldn't push their music to bigger heights.\n\nThere have been plenty of reviews already and everyone who\u2019s become a metal head, has crossed paths with this album. One of the major problems with this album is that it tries to be more epic than the previous album, but it\u2019s not very successful. The band used cheap tricks, like overly extending the songs, just to give the impression that it\u2019s \"epic!\". For instance, \"Disposable Heroes\", despite being one of the best songs, has three overlong choruses, which go on and on, until the song gets to the eight minute mark. This same problem goes for the title track, \"Master of Puppets\", with its overlong choruses, which somewhat kills the song. The melody part in the middle of the song is cute, but it's like Hetfield saying, \"Hey guys, see what I can do! Yeah!\" Speaking of \"disposable\", you could pretty much say for the song, \"Leper Messiah\", that it sounds pretty generic. However, you do have some adorable lyrics slapped onto it, but musically, there isn\u2019t anything noteworthy, and I would say that it\u2019s easily the worst song here.\n\nSpeaking of Hetfield, he sounds really soulless when it comes to his vocals, doesn\u2019t he? \"The Things That Should Not Be\", is a terribly boring and plodding song, which goes on forever, even if it\u2019s one of the shortest songs here, and Hetfield doesn\u2019t help the songs robotic nature. He doesn\u2019t input any emotions or add anything to make the song stand out; just keeping his monotone voice throughout. This is Metallica\u2019s attempt at being, Black Sabbath, but it\u2019s an amazing cure for insomnia. This continues on with, \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\", which tries so hard to repeat the previous albums, \"Fade To Black\", but it feels so bleak and whiny from Mr. Hetfield.\n\nThis is when I had the impression that, Master of Puppets, was just a weak and cheap replica of, Ride The Lightning. It appears that they've tried to cash in on the success of the previous album, and onto this, add an instrumental, and it\u2019s another eight track disc, with another acoustic opener. There\u2019s nothing refreshing here, and it's understandable why this album dragged the metal scene down as a whole. You know the impression, \"Perfection is the Enemy of Good\"; well, what if the \"perfection\" is just, decent. It\u2019s going to create a negative and hurtful ripple effect. It\u2019s a carbon copy of the previous album that became a marketing ploy, and to say that this is the standard for which all albums should be compared. The whole scene suffered because of this, just as the likes of, UltraBoris and hells_unicorn, have stated. If mediocrity is celebrated, it could cause a terrible effect, just like what we\u2019re hearing on today\u2019s radio. Slayer\u2019s, Reign In Blood, and Megadeth\u2019s, Peace Sells, are way superior albums to this, and if those albums were called, \"The greatest of all time\", by the masses, then things would\u2019ve been more successful in the metal industry as a whole. This album was definitely the turning point of the band, and for the worst, I\u2019m afraid. They had one positive hiccup in the, \u2026and Justice For All album, but after that, it was all artistically downhill from there on, and the band has never recovered.\n\nWhile many call this album a \"masterpiece\", it did expose the bands limitations. Hetfield is a decent songwriter overall, with good ideas here and there, but he cannot piece them together properly, unlike Mustaine, who knew how to formulate his ideas. To Hetfield\u2019s credit, he could come up with a few decent riffs, along with some decent lyrics. Lars has always been a crappy drummer from the start, and in all of these years, he still hasn't developed, delivering only the basics, and it has shown throughout their latter albums. Kirk's reliance on the \"Wah\" pedal for his so-called, creative solos, aren\u2019t that much to take notes on. Cliff Burton was the more competent out of the four players, with some good bass lines on the instrumental, \"Orion\". Overall, the album is a weak version of what thrash is supposed to be, which is to say that were trying to sound melodic by placing unnecessary melodic parts between songs, like the title song, and as I mentioned, it doesn\u2019t add up to much. Another example is the opening of, \"Damage, Inc.\", which has a melodic section that takes so long before the first riff comes into play. I can remember that I used to own a cassette version, which I'd switch off before the main song ever started, because I thought that it was part of \"Orion\".\n\nI first heard this album around 2001, and when I was getting into metal, I thought that it was okay. For a \"legendary\" album to get just an \"okay\" from my early metal brain, that wasn\u2019t a good sign, especially when I thought that albums like, \"Rust In Peace\" and \"Show No Mercy\", were amazing to my immature ears, and are still amazing. It took me a while to enjoy aspects of, Master of Puppets, and I thought it was a grower, but not a whole lot more. I\u2019m harsh towards this album because this is like the so-called, \"Standard bearer\", and any weakness isn\u2019t supposed to show from the biggest metal band in the world. I\u2019ll give you this example; we all know that the WWE is the biggest company when it comes to wrestling, and let\u2019s say that they put on an average to dreadful Wrestlemania, you\u2019d be so livid that you would show no mercy in your opinion of it. Well, this this is how I feel about Master of Puppets.\n\nOne thing you can say for this album is that it does create controversy, and it does divide people. Whether it be that they worship it, and believe that it\u2019s the greatest musical experience on the planet, or the most overrated piece of shit that ever existed; there is no middle ground here. I wouldn\u2019t say it killed metal as a whole, because the music did recover in the 2000s, somehow, but it did damage it for quite a while. The reason why the '90s wasn't so kind to metal, was that a new group of bands, disguised as metal, emerged on the scene, and it was this album which opened the gates to those poor imitators, who said, \"Hey!, I can create metal as well. Look at me!\" In the end, many accepted this as their \"master\", and have since, obeyed it. It's made a large group of sheep settle for nearly anything that Metallica have crapped out over the years, and many have eaten it. It\u2019s so annoying when you read a list that has the likes of, Beyonce, Kanye West and other rubbish on it, including the name Metallica, and this is where it all started. This was the beginnng of Metallica's artistic downfall, where they tried to disguise their creative, and technical flaws, with fancy little melodic parts, to make them appear like a revolutionary metal band, and this has fooled so many. Therefore, Metallica themselves are like the, \"master of puppets\", and they are certainly \"pulling\" many metal fans \"strings\", I'm afraid.\n",
        "\nSo here it is - the new 'tallica album. It not only managed to reboot my activities on this very encyclopedia - the infamous Metal Archives - it even rekindled my interest in writing again, after about seven years of absence. Trust me, I never wanted Lars & Co to influence me this much. Ever.\n\nThe major problem is that I\u2019m actually enjoying this. And not only for a spin or two, I've been listening to this on repeat almost everywhere - at home, in my car, even while pumping irons. No Metallica album has ever sparked my interest quite like this one did and still does (apart from the defiled monstrosity that is Lulu, an experiment gone SO TERRIBLY WRONG that it just has to be heard to be believed) and I'm slowly coming to terms with what's causing this weird kind of (guilty?) pleasure. \n\nHardwired is FUN; and rewarding. Like having your usual cornflakes for breakfast, or a good and solid, yet generic hamburger for dinner. Somewhat average, it does not taste quite like that once-in-a-lifetime steak where the visualization of its delight alone gets your juices flowing, but a reliable and enjoyable meal - nothing terribly exciting; no Indian Beef Madras or some hand-kneaded Salzburger Nockerl, just something that makes your belly feel comfortable without effort.\n\nFor some weeks now, I've been dissecting this album and by now I've found reasons why this workmanship-approach just works for me. The first observation was easy prey: James Hetfield\u2019s throat. \n\nIt not only seems that his rather limited range has expanded by a fair margin, there's also a lot more edge and rawness to his tone, something we probably haven't heard since that certain self-titled piece of mainstream success released 25 years ago. Listen to his delivery in Spit Out the Bone and tell me how that doesn't sound aggressive and like the man has grown some balls again. Another peculiarity is that James also manages to cut back on his usual \"yeaaaahs\" \"oohhs\" and drawn-out trademark \u201cpronunciation\u201d at the end of lyrical phrases - I'm sure that by now, you all know perfectly well what I'm talking about \u2013 which is a definitive plus in my book. \n\nThe hardest part in the writing of this review and a real slap in that face of mine has to do with a man who-must-not-be-named: Lars Ulrich.\n\nI hate his arrogance, his undeserved fame and most importantly HIS DRUMMING more than anyone else, but fuck, did he finally learn how to (ab)use a drumset properly? So yeah, there probably IS A LOT OF studio magic involved, but I CAN'T HEAR IT so here I am, in all honesty, plenty amazed to hear a formidable performance by this half-o'-man. Prolonged doublebass parts and the utilization of... TOMS! YES, Lars finally found out that there are several more options to end a measure than bashing a snare and/or cymbal to oblivion. He will never come close to legendary drummers like Menza, Lombardo, Hoglan or many gifted others, but considering his wretched past, this is a welcome surprise. \n\nYeah, even Rob Trujillo can be heard rather well. He actually has his moment in the spotlight, that one being the bridge section in Spit Out the Bone (yes, I already mentioned the song earlier and I hereby swear that I will do it again, because this thrashy track is definitely the best thing they\u2019ve written since\u2026the fall of Rome?) where he rides a nice bassline without any guitar riffs overshadowing him. I doubt he'll ever play a major role in Metallica's sound, but seriously, that was NEVER one of Metallica's true problems (and there were MANY).\n\nStill, this is Metallica whom we are talking about and most certainly, there are some more or less glaring flaws. The most obvious one - and I\u2019m not the first guy to talk about it - comes in the monomorphic form of Kirk \u201cluv-the-Wah\u201d Hammett. I\u2019ve heard rumors about him losing all his \u201ccarefully written-out and well-constructed\u201d lead guitar parts when HIS SMARTPHONE went missing; one must be really fucking stupid to not backup recordings or notation at least ONCE. I smell bullshit, but who cares, Kirk hasn\u2019t written a great solo since before the turn of the millennium and I doubt he still has any in him. So it is said that Kirk had to improvise his soloing on the fly and it really shows: the very basics of scales and structuring as well as the overbearing use of that damn WAH-WAH are repeated ad nauseam. All solos sound basically the same, with only slight variations in speed and length. I guess his footwork on that cursed pedal varies from time to time but I swear I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it even if I was forced to. Also, I\u2019m glad that he apparently doesn\u2019t have any writing credits on this album. I guess that\u2019s why there are actual riffs and real songs to be found here. Stylistically, Hardwired is a multilateral album, picking up pieces from the center of the band's eras, probably settling itself somewhere between And Justice For All and Load. Within this mindset, Hetfield seems to have found a comfortable niche. His riff writing is varied and memorable and that's why there are plenty of good quality heavy metal guitar stylings on display.\n\nEven though there are good ideas in abundance, the songs are still plagued by another Metallica-trademark, their daft desire to make their tracks longer than they should be. It\u2019s rarely as mind-numbing and destructive as it\u2019s been on many earlier records (this has been a problem since Master of Puppets, actually) but most songs could use some trimming of clogged fat. Again, Spit Out the Bone has enough qualities to not pursue this bad habit any further and while the title track isn\u2019t exactly a great opener, it does know when it\u2019s time to go. All other tracks, including the highlight Moth Into Flame, feel a bit too long for their own good. On most occasions, they tack on another verse/chorus section at the assumed end, even though the tune\u2019s respective peaks have already been reached and an earlier conclusion would have improved the overall impression.\n\nWhile there is no absolute stinker of a song on this album, there are some downers where the skip button is put into regular use; the tribute to Lemmy, Murder One does not impress at all, its lack of energy and speed (a true compliment to this man SHOULD be a blisteringly fast one if you ask me) and again - too much repetition \u2013 fail to evoke any emotion. Although Now That We're Dead has one of the more interesting drum patters, it's perhaps the best example for my previously mentioned exorbitant less-is-more approach. ManUNkind faces similar problems and it feels as if the whole seven minute track is built around that rather grating chorus and be sure that the rest of this tune is forgotten after you've hit the skip button again. Taken as a whole, I'm pretty much in line with many other reviewers here who prefer the first disc over the second one, but for me, the dip in quality is not as severe as expected. \n\nA considerable part of my ego wants to badmouth and burn these guys for all the unspeakable things they've served us over a seemingly endless space of time, but there's not much more to complain about here. It is an enjoyable ride, more or less from start to finish and to my wicked surprise, Hardwired gets more spins in my stereo than Dystopia (sorry for the inevitable Megadeth mentioning on a Metallica release) even though it's, technically speaking, NOT the better album. It's just catchier and fits my cravings more when I'm not in the mood for profound musical exploration and - at this point in my life - this happens more often than not. \n\nSo maybe James and Lars finally catered to the masses of oldschool fans. Or they suddenly realized that the majority of the music they created (or shat upon us) over the course of the last 25 years was bordering on criminal assault and that their first attempt at rejuvenating themselves was nothing but a lukewarm effort, dressed in a shoddy production suit.\n\nWhat can I say, I don\u2019t really care anymore because when I put all my prejudices aside, I just have to admit that Hardwired\u2026to Self-Destruct is deserving of some praise. Not unlike the new Metal Church CD, this album is loaded with pleasing moments, leeching off what is now almost ancient nostalgia, featuring a famous vocalist in good shape, a few classic guitar riffs and a set of good songs, which are brought down heavily by inconceivably lame guitar soloing and a few old and too well known blemishes that these old dogs just won't get rid of. Ever. \n\nHighlights: Spit Out the Bone, Moth Into Flame, Confusion, Halo on Fire\n",
        "\nThe year is 2008, the state of Metallica's integrity is in shambles from St. Anger, their 2003 stinker that even had the Load era fans scratching their heads. The stakes were high; could Metallica release a good album after their nearly 20 year streak of subpar material? Well, let\u2019s dive in.\n\nThe official releases of Death Magnetic all suffer from some of the worst mixing of all time. I once read that the CIA used to use Metallica songs during the tortures of foreign prisoners. If Death Magnetic were out back then, prisoners would be spitting out information right and left. To put it bluntly, having to listen to nearly 75 minutes of this album is an assault on your ears, and I mean that in the least complimentary way possible. In fact, if you take any song file and put it in a DAW such as Audacity, you\u2019d see square waveforms. It is truly that bad. However, fans have managed to remix the album through unusual means, some even managing to fully rectify these issues.\n\nI\u2019d like to reiterate that this album is 75 minutes long. This is not surprising, as that\u2019s how most Metallica albums post-Puppets have been. Bad production and long length in tandem is usually a recipe for a rather sour listening experience, but the songs themselves are not half bad. In fact, I\u2019d say that they\u2019re very strong, perhaps good enough to have appeared on And Justice for All or the Black Album. For some, the songs might seem like they\u2019re trying way too hard to capture the magic of their early years, which I would say is a little bit true. But on the other hand, I\u2019d say that they finally were able to (mostly) shed their weird hard rock image from the Load years and of course that garbage from 2003. Although many songs seem stretched past the length that they should be, they often do not feel their length, at least for the most part.\n\nUnfortunately though, there's a pretty bad song on here, one which really does suffer from overt drag; and that song is Broken, Beat & Scarred. This song has some really cool riffs, but is absolutely ruined by the lyrics. Many other songs have bad lyrical moments, such as the bridge of Judas Kiss, but no other song has such thoroughly clich\u00e9d, repetitious, dare I say fatuous lyrical content. What don't kill ya make ya more strong? Really? Am I listening to caveman Kelly Clarkson, or Metallica? If I had to make one major change to this album aside from fixing the mix, it would be to make Broken into an instrumental and to give Suicide & Redemption some lyrics.\n\nOne thing most may complain about is the sheer amount of repetition Metallica decides to indulge in on here. During the ending of End of The Line for example, the band just won't let the damn song finish! All that was required was a single, abrupt \"you've reached the end. of. the. line.\", but instead, they repeat that shit like 5 times. This happens on other songs, too, and it's likely a vestige of the, at the time, still pretty recent St. Angerly writing process (as are the introspective lyrics), but don't let that discourage you from checking Death Magnetic out, because the highlights and even the filler songs are, in fact, pretty great.\n\nThat's right; other than Broken, Beat & Scarred, no other song really disappoints. Highlights include the high speed thrashers: That Was Just Your Life, All Nightmare Long, My Apocalypse and arguably The End Of The Line. These four are somewhat of a new school take on old school thrash, besides That Was Just Your Life, which essentially channels And Justice For All. We also have some heavier, groovier tracks, two trademark Metallica ballads, and the instrumental, Suicide & Redemption. This instrumental is not their best by any means, but it has its moments; definitely groovier than any other Metallica instrumental, though it's probably the closest thing to regular rock on here.\n\nSo the guys aren't in their twenties anymore, and it kinda shows, especially in the vocal and drum departments. James is certainly adequate here, but nobody can deny that he hasn't come close to his performance on the Black Album in years. Lars hasn't really ever been an interesting drummer (other than in very specific instances like The Shortest Straw), but on here he holds it down like usual. His drumming on most of the tracks is fairly safe and simple, save for Suicide & Redemption, where everyone, even newcomer Rob Trujillo, shines instrumentally. James has one of the best solos of his career on Suicide & Redemption as well. Kirk contributed a lot of riffs on this album, which is good. His solos for the most part are.. decent I guess, but he really shreds on The Day That Never Comes and My Apocalypse. \n\nAll in all, I'd say this album is a more than sufficient comeback for the boys. Sure, the official version is unlistenable ear venom, but it's been 8 years and there are tons of competent remixes to choose from in order to fully appreciate the album. Many might say Death Magnetic is an example of has-beens trying too hard, but that doesn't really matter to me. I don't care if they're trying to hard, as long as what comes out is decent; and the music of Death Magnetic on a whole, to me, is.\n",
        "\nBands talk about their influences all the time, whether they\u2019re asked to or not. But few decide to dedicate an entire release to the bands they love as Metallica did with Garage Inc.. This is a curious release, and it\u2019s hard to defend Metallica for the criticisms this album receives. Although I personally enjoyed it in the past, it does feel like an embarrassing attempt by a celebrity band to reconnect with their underground roots, and as a result, it also feels like a cash grab (more on this later). Nonetheless, this album certainly merits a listen from any fans of the extreme music.\n\nGarage Inc. is a beast with two separate heads. The first disc sounds like a mature, sophisticated big brother, where the band tries to sell you how diverse their taste in music are, bringing songs from bands like Bob Seger and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds into the metal and punk mix. On the other hand, second disc is the brash, younger Metallica, focused solely on generally fast, abrasive tunes. The fact that you get 16 minutes of Motorhead, and the fact they covered \u201cStone Cold Crazy\u201d of all the Queen songs, are quite telling of the second disc\u2019s intent. With disc one and two combined, Garage Inc. works well as a curation by Metallica circa 1998.\n\nIn all fairness, Metallica deserves a big praise for the fact that they drew a good amount of songs from bands that are rather obscure. Many of these bands are probably unrecognizable especially to those who haven\u2019t really begun their journey deep into heavy metal; and let\u2019s be honest, even if you frequent Metal Archives, when have you ever heard of Sweet Savage? Not only are Metallica showcasing their genuine love for the underground bands that inspired them over the years, they are also leveraging their mainstream celebrity status to help their favorite bands get noticed by a wider audience - for example, Diamond Head has publicly stated that their career revival and elevated recognition is due, at least partially, to Metallica covering their songs on Garage Inc.. Metallica did do a great service to the metal community with this release, in a way that 99.9% of other bands can't. \n\nBut beyond their eclectic selection of bands to cover, it\u2019s hard to praise the band over the execution of the music. Performance in and of itself is as good as you\u2019d expect from Metallica, and I especially enjoy how Kirk Hammett nails all the solos and licks (case in point is Kirk playing a line originally played by a saxophone on \u201cTurn the Page\u201d). I'd even argue this is the best album Metallica put out this side of the self-titled album. And while production quality varies depending on when they were recorded - mid 80s on a cassette to late 90s in a studio - they are also decent relative to the context of each recordings. \n\nWhere Metallica disappoints is the fact that they just played all of these songs very literally. Covering songs is a great opportunity for a band to show off arrangement skills and add your own twist/flavor to it, and to my knowledge (i.e. I listened to many of the original songs over the years), Metallica spectacularly missed that opportunity. Garage Inc. would have been so much more than meets the eye if there was at least a song or two that Metallica managed to turn into some kind of a different monster, much like the way Marilyn Manson did with \u201cSweet Dreams\u201d or Johnny Cash did with \u201cHurt\u201d. This is why it Garage Inc. feels like a cash grab - there\u2019s very little artistic value offered here. Unless James Hetfield\u2019s signature \u201coooh\u201ds and \u201cnyagh\u201ds peppered throughout the music count as an artistic arrangement.\n\nWhile I firmly disapprove the lack of the band\u2019s attempt to give new life to any of these songs, it is also arguably forgivable since Metallica's intent is clearly to have fun above all else. This is evidenced particularly by the acoustic, campfire fun on \u201cTuesday\u2019s Gone\u201d from the first disc, where the band is joined by a bunch of friends. Garage recordings from 80s on the second disc, and Mercyful Fate medley are another examples of them having fun. Metallica is having a damn good time, and crucially, that feels genuine across the entire album.\n\nGarage Inc. lost its appeal for me over the years because of it lacks artistic originality, but I still enjoy it on occasion, and I\u2019m glad I got to listen to it back when it came out. It opened the door to some great extreme music for me, which was significant in the pre-internet days when I didn\u2019t have friends with similar taste in music. While I generally want my kids discover music on their own, Garage Inc. will be one of those records I am going to openly encourage them to listen to.\n",
        "\nMany people see Metallica as being one of the worst metal bands of all time, with major fuckups like Load/ReLoad, St. Anger, and Lulu. Lars Ulrich utterly sucks at drumming and James can't sing, with some stupid plodding riffs throughout the song. This wasn't always true, however. On this album, Metallica was an amazing band with fucking heavy riffs and kickass solos. Hell, even Lars Ulrich doesn't suck here! Get this album before anything else.\n\nEach and every riff here is fucking aggressive, with very few exceptions. Back in 1983, James actually knew how to write riffs. Of course, Dave Mustaine had the best riffs on the album, (Phantom Lord, Metal Militia) but James wrote some kickass riffs. Kirk Hammett's guitar solos are worthy successors to Mustaine's, that they shred like fuck. Cliff Burton was always a great bassist. He even has a fucking bass solo on this album, which has some cool classical shit in it, but when the drums kick in, it picks up and kicks ass. I hate to say this, but even Lars Ulrich was the best drummer when this album was released in, with his legendary drum fills like in \"Motorbreath\" which beat out bands like Venom and Jaguar in 1983.\n\nThe best part of this album is the raw energy that Metallica had during 1983. They were the heaviest band out there, out to fucking kill all the hair metal posers with their fucking thrashing music, hungry for their blood. It's not the shit on their latest album, which shows no energy, and only exists for the sake of longevity. No, this is some fucking raw thrash metal, with its kickass riffs and screaming solos.\n\nThe highlights of this album are \"Phantom Lord\", \"Metal Militia\", and \"Motorbreath\". Motorbreath, unlike most Metallica songs, just fucking thrashes from start to finish, with some fucking violent riffs and kickass solos. Motorbreath has some fucking heavy drumming from none other than Lars Ulrich. Phantom Lord's main riff fucking kills all in its path, and basically shits on every Metallica riff after Ride the Lightning! This may be the greatest Metallica song ever, with its amazing riffs, shredding solos, aggressive vocals. Metal Militia has fucking heavy riffs, blood pumping thrashing drumming, and a fast short solo that's the best on this album. Listening to \"Whiplash\" is like being in a mosh pit with several other headbangers with aggressive drumming and fucking violent riffs. Towards the end of \"No Remorse\", there is a scream like \"ATTAAAAAACK!\" which is the fucking battle cry of many bands like Exodus and Slayer attacking the posers in Los Angeles.\n\nThis is the best thing Metallica has ever put out. If you don't like this album, you don't like metal.\n",
        "\nJames and Lars are back in full force after the insanely fun train-wreck of Lulu and Hardwired is perhaps the best thing Metallica could had done in 2016. Say what you want about the quartet, they never gave up and they\u2019re always willing to experiment and renew themselves. At this point, they just do what they want and they earned this right.\n\nConsidering Kirk lost all his riffs in an iPhone incident (how fucking dumb is he?), the whole album is a collaborative effort by Metallica\u2019s eternal duo. The tall blond rhythm guitar god basically lifts the album to another level and the Danish tennis legend keeps things rooted in an efficient simplicity. Kirk is alright at times but he rarely has the place to shine and I\u2019m not even sure Metallica has or even need a bassist. Use Robert\u2019s skills, dammit.\n\nThis is a frustrating but good record since it's easy to identify what was necessary to make it a great one. The main faults are once again the overindulgence the quartet has and their complete lack of editing. This could be seen as the \"old metal legend\" syndrome as Priest and Maiden did it as well. Metallica's arch nemesis Megadeth's recent endeavors (except for Dystopia actually) sucked but for other reasons.\n\nI thought Death Magnetic was a fine record plagued with a messy loud production but Hardwired managed to sound renewed without compromising the identity of Tallica. It's just four guys having fun playing a style of music they like and I believe this is the biggest strength of this album. The biggest metal band on Earth sounds confident, powerful and convincing. I have no issues with the production either, it\u2019s heavy without being brick-walled.\n\nOne of the consensus that I've been seeing online is that it would had been a strong eight songs record and that most of the second disc is sort of weak. While I agree for the most part, I do think that the 12 songs (13 if we consider the new version of \"Lords of Summer\" as part of the record) are all solid and interesting. It\u2019s just too much to take in.\n\nThe first disc is catchier and faster while the second has this groovy doom approach but the entire opus is cohesive in its sprawling length. This is a feat in itself since I feel this is a song based effort. A compilation of new material if you will. It's self contained well-written numbers of mostly 6-7-8 minutes alternating between the eras of the Californian icons. Mixing the rock sound of the Loads, the thrashy comebacks of Death Magnetic and a fair share of the groovy heavy metal of the self titled, Hardwired is ultimately a fun album with strong songwriting and diverse footings. Metallica never wrote an uninteresting album and that's one of the reasons they're metal's most popular band. This one is no exception.\n\nHighlights:\n-The Lovecraftian Alice in Chains-esque vibe of \u201cDream No More\u201d.\n-The excellent leads at the end of \u201cHalo On Fire\u201d.\n-The aggressiveness and riffs of \u201cSpit Out the Bone\u201d\n-James\u2019 vocals\n-The RJD medley on the bonus disc is awesome, especially \"Tarot Woman\".\n\n\nCD1 85%\nCD2 77%\n\nMetantoine's Magickal Realm\n",
        "\nWARNING: This is an album that, while not entirely bad, is devoid of any real excitement.\n\nOh boy. This is a mammoth of an album to cover (and not in a good way). I\u2019ll start by mentioning that the songwriting on here is some of Metallica\u2019s most uninspired. Some examples include Hardwired, Atlas Rise, Dream no More, Confusion, ManUNkind, and, of course, Murder One. The title track is a blatant filler that they admit was written last just because they felt that the album needed a fast opener. Atlas Rise is a weird combo of Iron Maiden dual guitars with some sort of Holier than Thou black album vibe. Not to mention the E-string pull off groove that seems to be in every Metallica song since the Load era. Dream no More takes the slow, drab songwriting of Sad But True and combines it with laughable lyrics akin to some wannabe version of The Thing That Should Not Be. Confusion starts with the most blatant ripoff of Am I Evil that I have ever heard and then leads into another uninteresting excuse of a metal tune. Since ManUnkind was co-written by Rob Trujillo, I\u2019ll let it stand for what it is (just picture more mid paced Black Sabbath groove riffs). Finally, Murder One starts with a Sanitarium vibe before squeezing out one horrendous attempt of a track that sounds like a typical modern Metallica song that just meanders around with riffs that have been chugged many times before.\n\nSpeaking of which, this album has too much of that chug, is too \u201cgroovy,\u201d and just too slow. For a 77 minute release, it should not drag on as horribly as it does. This album also tries to be \u201cheavy\u201d just for the sake of it by implementing some strange grooves on the last two tracks (I daresay, the kind that make certain people crab walk on stage). As expected, this album has some of the most basic drumming I have ever heard in metal. Put Kirk\u2019s pentatonic noodling on top of it and you have a standard Metallica album. The production is better than Death Magnetic, but I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s its only redeeming quality in comparison to that particular album.\n\nSome tracks like Now that We\u2019re Dead (minus the awful solo), Moth Into Flame, and Spit out the Bone are fairly decent, but the remainder of this album\u2019s offerings are either \u201cmeh\u201d (i.e. Here Comes Revenge, Halo on Fire, & Am I Savage) or just bad.\n\nOn a side note, why did Hardwired have to be a double album?? Does Metallica also recognize the bad pacing and feel the need to separate the tracks? Because it is under 80 minutes and can fit on one CD. Also, why a video for every song? Are they just capitalizing on this project as much as they can because they cannot consistently release music? Anyway, I am here to review the album, not its sales strategies; so excuse the digression.\n\nMy biggest problem with this album is that it sounds like it could be a 90\u2019s Metallica record. I also think they set themselves up for failure by making a filler thrash song, making it the title track, and releasing it first, which I am sure gave some fans false hope of a \u201creturn to form.\u201d But let\u2019s face it. Metallica is not a band that sticks to a single form (although they are stuck in a mid-tempo shell of themselves). Despite my hating, this is really not that terrible. I mean, it\u2019s not Super Collider by Megadeth or their own St. Anger. Hardwired . . . To Self Destruct is just an embodiment of the mediocrity that is modern day Metallica. I really wasn\u2019t expecting a good album. After all, Death Magnetic was supposed to be their return; and whatever momentum that release brought to the band is long gone. To me, this is the final nail in Metallica\u2019s twenty year coffin and the surest sign that now is the time for them to retire.\n\nVerdict: Not worth paying for and certainly not worth the 8 years we waited for it.\n",
        "\n Written first for my blog, Grungy Land \n\nI don\u2019t really need to explain who Metallica is. You know who they are, your dad knows who they are, babies who just came out of the womb know \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d and \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d by heart. \n\nEven still, Metallica\u2019s discography has been\u2026 weird\u2026 as of late. The war crime known as St. Anger was released in 2003 before being followed up by what is possibly their best record, Death Magnetic in 2008, and a really hit-or-miss collaboration with Lou Reed in 2011. So it\u2019s safe to say that no one really knew what to expect with Hardwired... To Self-Destruct. The band\u2019s first batch of 100% original material in almost a decade. It should also be noted that this is the first Metallica album not to have any musical input from Kirk Hammett. \n\nThe thing to take away from Hardwired is that Metallica have always been, and still are\u2026 Metallica. It\u2019s hard to call the style of music they\u2019re going for here isn\u2019t Metallica to a T\u2019. What I mean by that is, much like Death Magnetic, Hardwired is a thrash album with more elements of blues rock and classic heavy metal rather than the faster, riff-heavy stuff of Megadeth or modern acts like Havok. So while some tracks (see \u201cHardwired\u201d, \u201cAtlas, Rise!\u201d) are very fast, the speed and intensity is not the focus. The focus is on more smooth sounding riffs with more melody and groove than your average thrash band.\n\nSo Hardwired pretty much lives or dies based on whether or not those riffs got you into the groove or not. This is where Hammett\u2019s lack of input both helps and hurts the album. Hardwired has two main flavors, so to speak. The hard and fast thrash that the band excelled at on Death Magnetic comes back, and when speed is the focus, the songs actually turn out pretty well. \u201cSpit Out The Bone\u201d, \u201cMoth Into the Flame\u201d and \u201cHardwired\u201d all succeed at what the band\u2019s best at: blues-y thrash. The other half, however, is a bit different. In the words of a die-hard Metallica fan friend of mine: \u201cSome of this album sounds like a no-bullshit version of Load and Reload\u201d. The songs that come to mind are \u201cManUNkind\u201d and \u201cAm I Savage?\u201d. Don\u2019t let the Load and Reload comparison turn you off, these songs are definitely slower and more melodious than the other tracks, but where it differs from Load and Reload is the riffs are much more creative and overall more musically diverse. As a result, they may not be all to your liking, but end up feeling like a great pace-breaker. \n\nAs for the actual mixing and sound design for Hardwired, not much has changed since Lulu or Death Magnetic. Strong, thick bass and loud drums to emphasize beat and rhythm, with similar distortion and effects added that occasionally emphasizes Hammett's solos (get ready for more wha than waluigi) and the occasional snappy drum fill. \n\nWhile Metallica hasn\u2019t necessarily gotten better, they haven\u2019t gotten worse either. That is to say, they have not achieved perfection, no matter what they actually think of themselves. That being said, if I had to point out some changes from Death Magnetic to now, the band did seem to learn from their mistakes. I always hated how overblown and repetitive some of the songs on Death Magnetic were (\u201cJudas Kiss\u201d didn\u2019t need to be 5 minutes long let alone 8), and while Hardwired is similar in length, it knows how to condense its music. Some songs do drag on, with nobody in Metallica appearing to know the difference between \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201crepetitive\u201d but instead of having 6 tracks that we just can\u2019t listen to because they drag on for 8 minutes, we have a small batch of songs that just could have been cut by a verse or two. As for the actual talent of the band, Lars hasn\u2019t gotten worse, Hammett sounds solid, Trujillo still sounds like he\u2019s being held back, it\u2019s all standard stuff. The only thing that does sound improved is Hetfield\u2019s voice, which has become more restrained as opposed to trying every five minutes to shout \u201cooh yeah\u201d or try to pull of a King Diamond falsetto. \n\nSo what\u2019s the final verdict? It\u2019s good. Not perfect, but Metallica really hasn\u2019t gotten worse over the course of a decade. One may wonder why they even bothered to write new music, since they\u2019re in that rare group of musicians who could endorse ISIS and still sell out stadiums. But with its blend of Metallica brand thrash and more heavy rock than a quarry, it was hard not to like Hardwired, even if it might have overstayed its welcome by the end. \n\nTLDR: It\u2019s fine, I would prefer a shorter album with more thrash, but Metallica\u2019s work is still good enough to warrant a purchase.\n",
        "\nThis album is perfectly fine, people. In fact, I'd wager it's pretty damn good. But I'm getting sick and tired of tryhard edgy teenagers giving this album scathing single-digit scores just because it's not ear-splitting mach-speed misanthropy like Anaal Nathrakh (and truly, we all know there can be only one), so I'm showing my face on the M-A review scene once again to try in vain to shove this baby back up to the score it deserves. Which is an 82%, if you couldn't tell. Now let's set this bullshit aside and look at the source of the bullshit! It's patently obvious Metallica have been listening to us bitching and moaning about how Death Magnetic was mediocre at best and that Lulu was an aural atrocity, so they've spent the past few years buckling down and putting some goddamn effort into their music once again, and if you ask me (which you should, because I am always correct), their efforts have paid off--this is easily the best album Metallica have put out since The Black Album, I'd argue it's even better than that and ...And Justice for All should be sleeping with one eye open, but let's not put on our piss-stained controversy knickers just yet.\n\nAppropriately enough, to set the tone, \"Hardwired\" comes barreling in with gusto, bursting with raucous energy that the band haven't displayed in literal decades. Fun Fact: At just over 3 minutes, this is actually the shortest original song the guys have released. And I think Lars is grateful for it, as he's actually stepped up his game for this track, pounding that now-tightened snare with verve and pedaling the double-bass as fast as his little feet can pedal, and I don't think his umlaut-laden heart could handle the song being any longer. The riffs are simple yet punchy, and miracle of miracles, you can hear the bass! But the biggest piece of news \"Hardwired\" illuminates for us is just how refreshed and energized James sounds, hearkening back at least to the Load days where he could breathe life into even the stalest radio-rock oatmeal. Of course, the song's biggest downfall is its need to throw a few 'fuck's around to earn that edgy-teenager-coveted Parental Advisory label so pasty white kids all over the country can impress their equally-pasty friends with how ruff'n'tuff they are. But as everyone knows (hopefully by now), I don't give lyrics that much weight, so my enjoyment of \"Hardwired\" is unaffected by its shameless white-boy pandering.\n\n\"Atlas, Rise!\" continues the trend laid out by its predecessor, delivering rock-solid performances from our nearly-geriatric heroes. It's hard to find anything to criticize here as I love all the melodic hooks and the riffs are memorable and catchy. As a bonus, the melodic bridge halfway through has been described as \"Maiden-esque\" by many, and serves as one of the track's many highlights. \"Moth Into Flame,\" another of the album's big singles, likewise impresses with its faster pace and infectious riffage paired with James' aggressive vocals. The chorus is catchy and all, but the pre-chorus is a thing of beauty that makes the whole thing tick. I suppose it would be appropriate to also mention the album's closer, \"Spit Out the Bone,\" in this section, as it's the last of the lightning-fast thrashers on the album, and for my money, it's easily the best. Everything I've discussed up to now about how Metallica have successfully infused speed, aggression, and catchiness into these songs (which, I reiterate, is truly a major feat for them nowadays) is on full display here, and amped to 11 to boot. Unfortunately, \"Spit Out the Bone\" does also display one of the damning flaws that have always plagued the band: their inability to bite the bullet and just shave a minute or two off for the sake of efficiency. Roughly 5 minutes in, the solo and the overall pace of the song slows to a crawl, and if that section were just cut out, I'd be perfectly comfortable placing it right alongside some of their 80s greats. Still my favorite track, though, and so my complaints ring hollow, which is why I can safely say MAN OVERTHROWN!! SPIT OUT THE BOOONE!!\n\nOh, and the deluxe version also has a neato final version of \"Lords of Summer\" that is surprisingly awesome, but I'll not be mentionin' where I obtained that bit o' treasure to ye. Yo ho, yo ho~\n\nNaturally, given the guys are approaching the so-called Golden Years, the entire album can't consist of these breakneck thrashers or else Lars would sprain his wrist and get gangrene or something, so we've got plenty of slower tunes to occupy the tracklist. Luckily, they're mostly pretty cool. \"Halo on Fire\" is one I didn't care for at first, but once I cleaned my ears out, I was treated to some grand, sweeping melodies and a bitchin' epic feel that picks up the tempo in the final few minutes with one of the strongest solos modern Metallica have given us. While the second half of the album is full of rock-solid mid-paced anthems, it's actually the slower and doomier \"Am I Savage?\" that stands out as a highlight. To me, it comes across as a moodier sequel to \"Of Wolf and Man,\" and I'm always a sucker for a badass werewolf track despite my usual protests against lyrical bias. And the eccentric main riff works brilliantly, too. But as far as the mid-paced methodical tracks go, the easy favorite is \"Dream No More,\" which is also the doomiest. Yes, that's a word. I made it up just now. The melody of the verses gives the song an almost arcane vibe as it rises uneasily and almost unnaturally--fitting, considering the subject matter--and culminates in one of the catchiest choruses on the album (\"YOU TURN!! TO STONE!! CAAAAN'T LOOOOK AWAAAYYYY!!\"). Whether they play fast 'n loud or slow 'n heavy, it seems Metallica were just on fire for this release, but sadly, all is not well.\n\nThe only track I outright disliked was \"Now That We're Dead,\" which just sounded too much like a bargain-bin copy of \"Enter Sandman\" for my liking, so it's not as though every other track I've left unmentioned is lousy--rather, songs such as \"Confusion\" and \"ManUNkind\" are perfectly serviceable tunes that have moments of tasty goodness here and there, but do little to distinguish themselves or justify their inclusion on the album. The worst offenders, however, are \"Here Comes Revenge\" and \"Murder One,\" both of which I remember absolutely nothing about at the time of this writing and after 4 full listens of the album. Oh, I remember liking them fine as they were playing, but alongside the utter lack of staying power, both tracks were simply that--just 'fine'. I don't immediately shit my pants, feel embarrassed, put on a new pair, and rush on down to Walmart to pick up the latest release of one of the biggest metal bands of all time just so I can hear 'fine'. I want quality, goddammit!\n\nNow, last paragraph notwithstanding, the fact that in 2016 we have a Metallica album that not only doesn't suck (YOU HEARD ME, YOU TRYHARD EDGY TEENAGE FUCKS), but also delivers some material that could legitimately stand alongside its legendary 80s predecessors, is truly miraculous. I would say that I hope this marks a step in the right direction for Metallica and that Hardwired Unnecessary Ellipsis to Self-Destruct was the beginning of a new era of classic albums in the band's discography, but we all know that isn't the case--it's a wacky anomaly of goodness that will inevitably be followed up with yet another disastrous collaboration before Lars drunkenly stumbles into his rhinestone-lined swimming pool (filled with whatever his species drinks) and drowns, so this is probably Metallica's last big hurrah. And if you ask me (as we've already established that you should), I'd be hard-pressed to ask for a better one.\n",
        "\nMetallica is the biggest metal band in the world today. Their first five albums form the backbone for anyone who claims to like the genre, and they have been a gargantuan force not only in the metal scene, but also in the music world in general. Since the new millennium however, fate has not been so kind to the band. Marked by two lackluster albums, a failed venture into both the world of cinema and the ever shrinking market of music festivals, the band has not been at its peak for a very long time. Enter Hardwired. \n\nThis album came out of nowhere as audiences were swiftly slapped in the face by the old school sounding title track. The band used this song to great effect as it starts the album off with high energy and claims the listener's attention for the tracks to come. There is a renewed sense of urgency present on the first disc of the album and its a feeling Metallica hasn't been able to emit in quite sometime. The mix is very hot, the song structures get to the point much faster, and the riffs are actually quite powerful. Metallica clearly listened to the criticisms of their previous album here and it's appreciated greatly. The first disc concludes with a very catchy and memorable track in \"Halo on Fire\" and the second disc begins with a throwback to their 90's mid tempo style with \"Confusion\". \n\nThe second disc of this album is nowhere near as strong as the first though. As the disc drags on we hear very little variation in tempo and the snare drum is overused on nearly all of the tracks. The songs \"ManUNkind\" and \"Am I Savage?\" are bloated in terms of structure and by the time I made it to \"Murder One\", a tribute to the late Lemmy of Motorhead, I was quite exhausted by the pacing and had to struggle to keep paying attention. Despite these gripes, the album goes out with a bang as the Kill 'em All style returns for the closing track, \"Spit out the Bone\". \n\nThere is a plethora of things in this release that honestly surprised me. From the renewed aggression present on many of the tracks, to the catchy guitar harmonies and the vocal hooks, this record is the best the band has sounded in over twenty years. It actually feels like the band has a statement to make and that they are angry about something. This is amazing to see as it would've been so easy for these titans to release an uninspired, cash grab of an album like Slayer's \"Repentless\". However, this effort is not without its flaws. The pacing can be a bit grueling at times to sit through, some of the lyrics come off as awkward, and Kirk Hammet's lead playing has become very predictable and is way too wah-heavy. All in all though, we are treated to a mostly well put together collection of tracks from metal's biggest player.\n",
        "\nWhat is versus what one wants to believe is the constant conundrum that faces any person approaching Metallica, save maybe for a sizable collection of die-hard fans who buy music for the name rather than the contents that this band has in spades. Far be it for the author of this review to lob insults at the fans of a longstanding metal institution, but he can't really come up with any logical explanation as to how anyone could consume everything bearing the Metallica insignia from 1982 up until now without even one isolated fit of indigestion. But by the same token, he is arguably guilty of a bizarre fit of perpetual masochism by continuing to bother with a band who's subsequent material he hasn't liked for the better part of 25 years, thus an explanation is required. Metallica were very much his favorite band at one point and time, and against more than two decades of denying the first five letters in their name, he was hoping to be proven wrong in his continuing cynicism, to the point of vowing to publicly confess as such when the time had come.\n\nHardwired...To Self-Destruct is that long awaited album, at that long awaited time, that has forced this online mea culpa, and it is a happy occasion in spite of it all. While naturally this welcome change of pace comes with a few caveats, the big one being that it isn't quite a full out thrash metal fest by even the standards of ...And Justice For All, this is the first thing to come out of Metallica since my public school days that can be qualified as solid and, more importantly, fun. Gone are the lame country-singing ways and lazy rock riffing badness of Hetfield's more recent past for something that is respectably animated and gritty, gone is Lars' ego driven desire to reinvent the concept of audio recording and coming out with absolute shit in the process, and a welcome return to the days when Kirk Hammett could play a guitar solo like he actually means it. To put it bluntly, this band finally decided to play metal in an unapologetic fashion, and barring Lars' drums being a bit too loud, the whole thing gels together in a manner that is somewhat reminiscent of the sonic character of The Black Album, though stylistically it reaches back a bit earlier.\n\nAt first glance, this might appear like a bloated mess of experimentation similar to the disastrous side stint with Lou Reed in Lulu given the song lengths. Thankfully, there is more of a method to the epic madness on display here, as the likes of \"Atlas, Rise!\" and \"Halo Of Fire\" manage to bridge a long insurmountable divide between Metallica's heavy-hitting thrashing roots and the more melodic tendency that came to the fore in the later 80s and eventually ended up supplanting the former in the 90s. The songs are repetitious, but the riffs themselves are animated, punchy and memorable enough to justify the sort of continual display reminiscent of ...And Justice For All. Actually, said album appears to have been a crucial influence in the direction of the songwriting, to the point where the mid-paced crusher \"Confusion\" could almost be dubbed a sequel to \"Eye Of The Beholder\" with occasional traces of their original reinterpretation of \"Am I Evil?\" and the cruising epic \"Moth Into Flame\" has noted similarities to \"The Shortest Straw\" and \"Dyer's Eve\". Even the new guy of over 10 years time Robert Trujillo finds himself able to break through the arrangement and emulate some of the more intricate possibilities on the bass since this band's time with Cliff Burton.\n\nThis isn't so much an album that goes the route of self-plagiarism the way a lot of recent efforts from the likes of Def Leppard has in order to recapture former glory, but more an exercise in needed self-reflection. The result is something that still retains some of the restrained elements that epitomized The Black Album, aka the band's full pivot away from thrash metal. Songs such as \"Here Comes Revenge\" and \"Now That We're Dead\" definitely play a bit more to the slower to mid-paced character that ushered in the band's commercial breakthrough, though they are presented in a longer fashion that takes them out of the realm of commercial, at least in the classic radio play sense. Truth be told, the only song on here that could truly pass for radio is the thrash happy opener \"Hardwired\", which is probably the most intense song on here in that sort of \"Battery\" meets \"Blackened\" sense, with maybe the exception of the long-winded nod to \"Disposable Heroes\" closer \"Spit Out The Bone\". This sense of self-reflection becomes so intense that the special Japanese release includes a revised version of this band's lukewarm 2014 single offering \"Lords Of Summer\" that actually manages to kick some ass too.\n\nTo anyone that ended up writing this band off completely at any point between the 90s and now, this is about as close as this band will likely ever come to revisiting the original spirit that first made them the go to band for anyone looking to experience metal music. No, Metallica has not brought thrash metal back with this album, that happened years ago when other bands that cropped out of the thrash revival took the reigns and/or a number of older acts decided to get with the program. What they have done is ceased in digging their heels and trying to be something that they aren't, namely an experimental pop band that feels the need to reinvent themselves every couple years while giving their original fan base the one-fingered salute. Barring this album being followed by another pile of sonic excrement, anyone should be content to forget that anything associated with the Metallica name between 1995 and 2015 ever happened, and I've already started practicing while closing off this long anticipated day of joy.\n",
        "\nI should have been a librarian. I originally thought accounting was going to be my calling in life, then I realized how boring that was. Then I wanted to be a chef. That didn\u2019t pan out. Since that point some would say I\u2019ve become a professional dickbag and that very well could be true. But I should have been a librarian. It\u2019s not because I like to read or anything but I have this obsession with cataloging and order.

And I keep track of what I\u2019ve listened to and what I haven\u2019t. So cataloging an archive of media seems right up my alley. How does this have anything to do with the review? Well, it\u2019s really the only way you would likely believe me when I say I finally found the positives in this album, 86 listens later. \n\nYep, that\u2019s an eight and a six. 86 spins of St. Anger. And that\u2019s not over the course of the last 13 years, that\u2019s between 2003-2005. Or at least the sticky note on the inside of the cover that contains each tick mark from every listen actually indicates. Bob Rock likely hasn\u2019t even listened to this album that many times. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not a remarkable number for anyone listening to their favorite album ever. But for St. Anger, it must be. It didn\u2019t take me that many times to enjoy the record but rather to finally admit that I did. Before that I would blindly nod and agree with everyone that it sucked but with no real backing behind that. Now, I can say in all honesty that I don\u2019t mind it at all. That\u2019s still the best I can do though. I cannot say, even with 86 fucking bludgeonings of my eardrums that St. Anger is truly a good record. But it\u2019s not a terrible one and I\u2019ve learned to accept that. \n\nThe real flaws of the record do not improve over the course of so many spins. Most of the songs are simply way too damn long. Metallica has zero concept of when to properly end a song. Never had, never will. The big difference is that the early years were so good that you wanted eight minutes. Now you long for just four great ones and get those four, then simply rinse and repeat again to double the length of the track. Some producer needs to have the balls to go into the studio and cut tracks to 4:30 and say \u201csee how useless those last four minutes actually are?\u201d \n\nThen there\u2019s the infamous drum sound. I can\u2019t say on the 70th listen that I heard anything different than I did with the first listen. But I think I got used to them. Or I like them now. Honestly, it\u2019s something that still baffles me. The snares no longer bother me and in fact are clearly one of the most memorable parts of the album. Not good. Not necessarily bad. But you can\u2019t forget the sound as much as you believe you want to. \n\nWhat the repeated listens of St. Anger did for me though was they got me to the place where I could enjoy the fact they tried something different. It got me really listening to the nuances of James\u2019 vocals and focusing on each individual riff. They got me to really appreciate points like the one in \u201cInvisible Kid\u201d where the rhythm slows to a crawl and James\u2019 vocals are almost off-key, the warbly-ass \u201cenough\u2019s enough\u201d at the end of \u201cMy World\u201d or simply the Korn-like qualities of \u201cShoot Me Again.\u201d And how endearingly creepy/awkward is the repeating of \u201ckill, kill, kill, kill\u2026\u201d to end the record? \u201cOff-key,\u201d \u201cWarbly-ass\u201d \u201cawkward\u201d \u2013 yes, they sound like negatives and at one point they might have been but for me they have become the reason I actually enjoy listening to this album. \n\nEach successive listen got me really thinking about why a band like Metallica would attempt such an album. I can\u2019t possibly understand the immense pressure Metallica was under trying to figure out how to make a relevant album at this point in their career. But when I started approaching the album with the mindset that St. Anger is Metallica simply trying to get themselves out of their own fucking heads, then it made a lot of sense at least. Metallica couldn\u2019t simply make Re-re-load and will never make another Ride the Lightning. So instead of trying to appease the masses, they created an album for themselves. They went gritty and as raw as a multi-platinum artist in a massive studio with anything they wanted at their disposal could probably go. And they tried. While I realize that \u201ctry\u201d isn\u2019t really good enough for a band like Metallica, I can appreciate that they didn\u2019t shit out the same record again. Here in 2016, for the life of me, I can\u2019t figure out what Metallica fans want. Half of us want \u201cAnd Justice\u2026Part Deux\u201d and the other half bitch that they keep repeating themselves. Really, at this point in their career, I\u2019m certain they will never make another record that pleases the majority of fans. So even thinking back on St. Anger, I appreciate how this sounds like nothing else they ever did. And really, if you\u2019re being honest, it really doesn\u2019t sound like any other record ever made. Uniqueness doesn\u2019t make it great but it does make it wildly interesting, for me at least. I would take all the awkwardness of \u201cThe Unnamed Feeling\u201d any day over a recycled thirty-year-old thrash riff. \n\nYou could certainly argue that simply learning to \u201caccept\u201d a record is not good enough, nor is having to listen to it 86 times to get there. I can\u2019t argue with that. But what I can argue is people reach different conclusions in different ways. I took the wildly long-and-roundabout way of getting to this point and that\u2019s good enough for me. That said, I do not plan on listening to Lulu 86 times. Even I realize that sometimes suck is simply suck. St. Anger does not suck.\n",
        "\nEven though it looks atrocious to me, the album cover actually represents Metallica's new output very well. The band looks back on its early years and successes and offers an eclectic mixture of its first five studio albums. Hardwired... to Self-Destruct includes several tracks that feature the aggressiveness, energy and speed of Kill 'Em All which surprised many critics positively. It offers several longer tracks that keep the balance between tightly performed and very rhythmic passages and more plodding and melodic parts with classic heavy metal influences as on Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets which was to be expected. Other tunes sound more clinical and are based upon groovier rhythms as on ...and Justice for All as this release finally gets the recognition it deserves by the band. A few tunes are slightly shorter, more accessible and quite catchy which represents the self-titled album without reaching the quality of its best cuts. Hardwired... to Self-Destruct basically sounds like a revamped greatest hits collection of Metallica's diverse styles in form of new songs.\n\nThis is not the first time Metallica attempts to go back to its roots. After the controversial yet very unique St. Anger record, the band tried to create a more traditional thrash metal album in form of Death Magnetic. While this album had a few excellent songs, it fell off in the second half and suffered from a terribly loud and unbalanced production. After the experimental collaboration with Lou Reed in form of Lulu, history repeats again as Metallica tries once more to release a more traditional thrash metal release. Death Magnetic and Hardwired... to Self-Destruct are actually quite similar in terms of approach, sound and style. Simply put, if you liked Death Magnetic, you will also like Hardwired... to Self-Destruct but the opposite is also true.\n\nThere are a few things where Hardwired... to Self-Destruct performs better than Death Magnetic. The new album is still overproduced but not as massively as the loudness war offered eight years earlier. While the predecessor only featured long and often unfocused, tedious and repetitive tunes, the new album finally features a song that is short, precise and concise in form of the quasi title track ''Hardwired''. I would have liked to hear more songs like this ferocious opener that sounds so motivated that one might actually think that this track is a forgotten bonus track from the Kill 'Em All sessions. Despite being more than twice as long, the pitiless epilogue ''Spit Out the Bone'' remains highly addicting from start to finish and closes the circle to the brilliant opener.\n\nThere are also a few elements where Hardwired... to Self-Destruct convinces less than Death Magnetic. The predecessor had a few fillers in the second half but the new album falls really flat on the second disc and offers quantity instead of quality. Aside of the vivid album closer, all other five tunes on the second disc are plodding and overlong, feature different unfocused song writing ideas that don't stick together and have no flow and rehash several structures and lyrics the band has already used before and employed with more urgency in the past. While the predecessor features many memorable songs that work very well in concert, the only truly outstanding tunes on the new record are the thrash metal masterpieces ''Hardwired'' and ''Spit Out the Bone'' as well as the more melodic mid-tempo stomper ''Moth into Flame'' that goes successfully back to the ...and Justice for All era. While several other tunes have good passages, the new record only features three excellent tunes that convince in their entirety out of twelve or thirteen if you consider bonus track ''Lords of Summer'' as part of this release. It's not a disaster but it's not a great ratio either.\n\nAnother reason why this record sounds two-faced to me is related to the individual performances on this album. James Hetfield sounds as convincing, juvenile and passionate as in his early years. His vocals are constantly powerful and he even mostly avoids his usual flaws and trademarks in form of silly exclamations like ''oh!'', ''uh!'' and ''yeah!'' that have dominated Metallica albums for about two decades. People like to criticize Lars Ulrich to unfair extents but it sounds obvious to me that his drum play sounds much improved on the new album as if he had taken additional drum lessons. He seemingly unforcedly keeps the speed, rhythm and urgency alive during the entirety of the challenging album closer ''Spit Out the Bone'' for example and he also adds interesting drum patterns in several tracks as in the calmer passages of ''Now That We're Dead''. He shows the numerous critics that he's still able to pull off an expert job. Both Hetfield and Ulrich deliver their best performances since ...and Justice for All in my book.\n\nOn the other side, the other two members are lacking creativity, presence and urgency on the new album. Robert Trujillo has one shining moment with a vivid bass solo in ''Spit Out the Bone'' but otherwise he doesn't take much space and offers a rather conservative background performance. He only has one single song writing credit on the entire album in form of ''ManUNkind'' which is one of the most uninspired tunes on the entire record. The most disappointing element about the new record is Kirk Hammett's performance though. He has no song writing credit at all which can't just be excused by the doubtful story that he lost his iPhone including numerous riff ideas. To make things worse, his uninspired guitar solos almost always sound the same and often don't fit to the vibe of the specific song. They often sound like bluesy hard rock solos with unnecessary spectral glides. To be honest, Hetfield and Ulrich could have pulled this record off with some young session musicians in the key of other thrash metal bands like Annihilator and Megadeth and the final result would have been the same or even better which is a very sad thing to say. Trujillo and especially Hammett need to step up and have something to prove on a potential next studio record.\n\nIn the end, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct is a very average thrash metal record that doesn't deserve the attention it gets. Occasional fans, die-hard completionist and non metal fans who are only purchasing this record because of the group's famous brand might be momentarily satisfied. More experienced, faithful and intellectual metal fans should download ''Hardwired'', ''Moth into Flame'' and ''Spit Out the Bone'' or wait until these songs will be included on an upcoming live release.\n",
        "\nMetallica has been a very divisive band since the 90s. On one side are those who want to heap praise on the band at every opportunity, willingly overlooking poor outputs (Load, Reload, St. Anger, Lulu) and their celebrity attitude. On the other side are naysayers who feel alienated and irked with how far removed the band is from their underground past, often reluctant to give the band some credit for 2008's Death Magnetic. With Metallica, many of us are stubborn about which side we take. And Hardwired\u2026 to Self-Destruct won\u2019t change anything about that deep divide in sentiment amongst us. \n\nHardwired\u2026 sounds like the Black Album with emphasis on mid-tempo riffs, with a healthy portion of Kill \u2018em All-era sound mixed in. It's inspired and ambitious, and Metallica really sounds like they're trying to write something worthwhile. But ultimately, Hardwired... is also at a quality level far from that of the Black Album or Kill \u2018em All, thanks to a pair of key shortcomings - song structure and lyrics. \n\nMany of these songs are weighted down with unnecessary fat - Hardwired\u2026 was recorded and mixed over the course of 15 months, and the the band must\u2019ve gotten too comfortable with their own material. The music drags particularly on Disc 1 - \u201cNow That We\u2019re Dead\u201d, \u201cMoth into Flame\u201d, \u201cDream No More\u201d, and \u201cHalo on Fire\u201d could\u2019ve all trimmed the prolonged chugs of average riffs to let the better parts of the song come forward. Same criticism also applies to \u201cAm I Savage?\u201d and \u201cMurder One\u201d on the 2nd disc. On too many occasions within these songs, I found myself twiddling my thumbs waiting for the next development or even losing my attention altogether. The music is fun while it lasts and it's obvious James Hetfield still has the riff-writing skills, but it collectively fails to leave a lasting impression.\n\nOn the bright side, Metallica tries some stylistic experimentations that sometimes work and sometimes doesn't, while individual performance on the instruments are refined and generally strong. Of the four members, Lars Ulrich deserves special praise. While he's had his deserved criticisms for his drumming in the past, Lars sounds intense on this one, as if he had to prove something to us. And when Lars experiments, it works well. My favorite Lars moment is on \u201cManUNkind\u201d, where he makes a subtle use of swing/rockabilly beat you\u2019d normally expect from someone like Jimmy Bower of Down. Slick use of 3/4 + 6/4 rhythm pattern in the same song is another highlight, as is the quirky use of kick drums (quirky, but certainly works!) on \u201cSpit Out the Bone\". What Lars has done is nothing special technically, but his creative twists are welcome additions that salvages moments that would otherwise be dull. \n\nWith regards to experimentation, a curious case is Kirk Hammett. Solos inspired by Iron Maiden pops up once in a while, and \"Dream No More\" even offers a solo transplanted right out of an early Arch Enemy song. These stylistic departures didn\u2019t work for me, but changing things up is highly appreciated given that the album is generally bland. And no complaints on Rob Trujillo's bass (intro to \"ManUNkind\" is a highlight).\n\nThe greatest culprit for the shortcomings of this album is in the lyrics. Hetfield used to be a talented lyricist, and anything up to Black Album sounded genuinely evil thanks to some painful lyrics and inspired singing - \u201cOne\u201d, \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d, \u201cSad But True\u201d, you name it. Here though, urgency, desperation, and rage that made Hetfield so powerful are utterly lacking (it's been gone for years). Case in point is the opening line \u201cObey, obey, come won\u2019t you stay\u201d on \u201cHalo on Fire\u201d - in his worst moment on the album, Hetfield sounds more like he\u2019s singing at a Karaoke bar than someone with an urge to communicate something from deep within. This is really unfortunate, given that Hetfield actually hasn\u2019t lost his vocal power, as he demonstrates it here and there that his pipes are still in good condition (some of the screams on, again, \u201cHalo on Fire\u201d is a case in point). Singing capabilities are there, the soul is not. \n\nAll in all, Hardwired\u2026 surpassed my expectations in spots, but the end product is nowhere near good enough to improve my overall (i.e. low) opinion of the band. In fact, I'm sure many on both sides of the Metallica divide will stay on their sides - the album will please fans who want to be pleased, and it won\u2019t win over the fans who already lost their love for the band. With this level of music, I\u2019m honestly skeptical as to if those who enjoy the album will find themselves coming back to it in 2, 5, 10 years. Time will tell.\n",
        "\nI checked out this album mostly out of sheer curiosity. So, is this album \u201ca return to form\u201d? Well, no, not really. Not at all, actually. This is for the most part based on thrash metal, I can say that (but it\u2019s not pure thrash), and it\u2019s much better that Death Magnetic, but other than that, there\u2019s not much really good to say. Nothing is terrible, either, though.\n\nThe biggest problems with Hardwired... to Self-Destruct are length of most of the tracks and that the album feels way too forced. You cannot just shit out a good album, that\u2019s not how it works. OK, I\u2019m being too harsh by saying \u2018shit out\u2019, but yeah, this feels forced. It\u2019s like it became a chore to make an album because fans expect it. Actually, who am I kidding, that\u2019s pretty much exactly what happened. As for the length of the tracks, Hardwired doesn\u2019t suffer from that problem (three minutes), but other tracks could\u2019ve been shortened by a minute (or two in some cases). Sometimes, long tracks can be awesome, but these are overlong for no reason except being overlong for the sake of being overlong.\n\nAnother problem is repetition, most of this album sounds like a rehash of Metallica\u2019s older material. After St. Anger and Death Magnetic, this can arguably be considered an improvement, but it\u2019s otherwise a problem. Another aspect of repetition is that some tracks sound like they just repeat one riff throughout the track, with a section or two to break the monotony to no avail (Now That We\u2019re Dead and Dream No More are good examples).\n\nThe production is much better and cleaner than it was on Death Magnetic. Still, I can say that the drums sound too loud. When we take into consideration what techniques Lars usually uses, that becomes quite a problem. Kirk still uses wah-wah pedals, but unlike many times in the past, he doesn\u2019t overuse as much as he often did, but there\u2019s still a lot of it; if you\u2019ve already hated it, you\u2019ll hate it here, too. When it comes to vocals, James just doesn\u2019t have what he had anymore. He sounds better than on Death Magnetic, I\u2019ll give him that, but he simply lost it. Whatever he did on Metallica\u2019s early albums does not appear and it\u2019s extremely unlikely it will appear in the future.\n\nSome songs are better than the rest: Hardwired (despite the whole \u2018We\u2019re so fucked, shit out of luck\u2019 part), Moth Into Flame, Spit Out the Bone have better riffs than the rest and are overall better tracks from this album. In fact, Spit Out the Bone is by far the best track on this album; it\u2019s thrashy, fast and well-written, but it\u2019s preceded by maybe the worst song on this album, Murder One, so that kind of ruins the experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re really curious, I guess you\u2019ll check out this album anyway simply to see what it sounds like, and I guess curiosity is as good a reason as any. But if you\u2019re looking for a masterpiece, this is definitely not an album for you. If you decide to skip it, you\u2019re really not missing out much. It\u2019s not terrible, but it\u2019s not good either, just average for the most part.\n",
        "\nSo, here we are now. Is there something still to be said about the new Metallica album? I was supposed to write this review a little earlier but I've been too busy with my studies. Anyways, I'm here to tell my own opinion in case someone wants to hear it.\n\nTo start with, I think it's good to tell what kind of guy (=my relationship with Metallica) this review is coming from (if you're not interested, just skip this paragraph, please): I pretty much like all Metallica records. If I gotta say some flaws in their discography, my least favorite albums are St. Anger, Black Album and Kill 'em All. St. Anger has some good ideas, and nice grooving but the songs are overall stretched too far. Although, I still think 'The Unnamed Feeling' is an awesome track. Black Album introduced me to Metallica and I liked it as a kid but it has too many filler tracks and too many way overplayed songs that I'm done with. Kill 'em All introduced Metallica to the world and it's an important record but many of the songs are not that interesting yet. 'The Four Horsemen' and 'Metal Militia' are killers, though. Many people also dislike Death Magnetic but for me it's their best album right after the three remaining albums of the 80s.\n\nHardwired... to Self Destruct, woah, new Metallica once again? The world now sees new, never-heard-before Metallica! A great moment. The best thing here is that the album is also good. At first, I didn't care much for the songs we heard before the album came out. 'Hardwired' was pretty nice with all the speed and tightness but it was so quickly over that I couldn't get a grip on what's coming. Eventually 'Moth into Flame' and 'Atlas, Rise!' also grew on me and the hype was real. \n\nMany people say that the album is too long and it doesn't carry all the way through. The guys might have been suffering from lack of compressing and focusing their music to the tightest edge for a long time. Actually, even my favorite Metallica album ---and Justice for All has very long songs and stretched out ideas but the thing is, it doesn't matter when the riffs are all so golden. I guess the key is to make the songs longer if their foundations are good enough. On Hardwired... to Self Destruct the tracks' average length is somewhere around at least six minutes again. Luckily most of the songs are strong enough to keep me entertained for the whole running time. \n\nThe album offers twelve new songs, ten of which I like to think can be classified as \"good\" songs. It's funny how often I think the weakest tracks on any album are the ones after the midway through the album but not the last ones. Do bands place the weakest tracks there on purpose? 'Am I Savage?' (at least the cringy chorus) and 'Murder One' are both very boring and mediocre whereas 'Spit out the Bone' (placed to be the last track) makes a tenacious comeback with rocking out like hell! It's quite much pure thrash and something so fresh and good sounding that I never believed Metallica could do something like it anymore even that I like the other kind of songs they make too. Also the closure track for the first half is one of the highlights of the album, especially the final section which starts after 5-minute mark. The lead guitar harmony that gently carries through the rest of the song is something very enjoyable. I even get some kind of \"heroic\" kind of vibes when James sings \"hello darkness, say goodbyeeee\". It's really cool, believe me!!11! Anyways, the album would've made a stronger ten-track record. Two of the songs on the second half are dull and they are even placed right next to each other. Dull and unimportant 10 minutes.\n\nAbout the guitar work here...it's hard to be at your most creative when you've basically already achieved it all in music. Hardwired... isn't as great a riff-fest as Justice... but a strong base for the songs is there. 'Confusion' and 'Spit out the Bone' have the greatest riffs in my opinion. I don't understand the controversy around 'ManUNkind'. It's also a strong hard rock track and Robert Trujillo's groovy elements are unleashed here too as he has a credit to the song. It's sad that Kirk Hammett lost his phone and all the ideas he had for the album. I initially thought it was an excuse for the album not progressing \"fast enough\" but ok, I believe him. Too bad, though. Hardwired... isn't one Kirk's greatest moments when it comes to his solos either. After around seven listens to the album I still find it hard to distinguish any memorable solos. It's all just \"ok\". In time, we'll see...maybe. \n\nIn conclusion:\n- Fun to listen to\n- Some great riffs, not as great solos\n- Metallica is still relevant and also can make great thrash metal. Hardwired... to Self Destruct isn't a masterpiece but it IS a nice piece\n- Bonus point for the theme of 'Dream No More'. I'm a huge H.P. Lovecraft fan\n",
        "\nThankfully Metallica at least achieved a passing grade and Hardwired\u2026To Self Destruct is still their best effort churned out in the past 25 years since the release of the Black Album. It\u2019s an album that pays homage to Metallica\u2019s long musical history by incorporating all those key audible traits of the band that some had been buried and never summoned to life in quite a long time. For example we have the harmonious and melodic duo guitar work of \u201cMoth into Flame\u201d and \u201cAtlas, Rise!\u201d which takes us back to Ride The Lightning era or the solid thrash riffing from \u201cHardwired to Self Destruct\u201d and \u201cSpit Out The Bone\u201d which reminds us of Master of Puppets, to the more recent lighter side of Metallica portrayed in Load and Reload with the track \u201cHalo On Fire\u201d and other mid-tempo based songs. So in essence what we have is a sonic palette of different phases of Metallica with more emphasis on their thrash metal sound. It\u2019s this sound that has longtime fans joyously claiming how Metallica has finally fulfilled their promise with Hardwired and has delivered a \u201csolid\u201d thrash album. To an extent that's true, but to another extent I beg to differ: \n\nWhile there is definitely some pure thrash elements, Metallica just hasn\u2019t seemed to give us that raw sound without the tasteless filler of some redundant and boring tracks laid around the tracklist. There is still too much mindless bluesy noodling from Kirk Hammet that has plagued us since Load and Lars\u2019s drumming isn\u2019t bringing anything new to the table; in fact Lars is a lazy drummer and could have spent the whole 8 damn years between Death Magnetic and Hardwired to seriously work on his chops, but when you are filthy fucking rich you really don\u2019t give a shit about such matters. The drum beats laid out by him are uninspired and threadbare and just make the album feel sluggish in my opinion; in essence there is nothing interesting happening in the drums department. \n\nJames does a perfect job with the vocals though and hasn't sounded alive and kicking in quite a long time, he still hasn\u2019t lost that golden, raspy voice that we love and constantly delivers his symbolic vocal techniques throughout the album while his guitar work complements him all the way. Robert takes more of the limelight this time, thankfully the bass can be heard throughout the album and has bagged songwriting credits with the track \u201cManUnkind\u201d. It starts with an interesting solo bass performance reminiscent of Cliff Burton but shit hits the fan and the song just collapses like a house of cards and morphs into something totally unrelated: a hard rock, groove metal type of track. This flash in the pan habit also occurs on \u201cHalo On Fire\u201d which starts with lots of grandeur, it makes you itch for the following frenzy but you are suddenly disappointed with that Load/Reload version of Metallica. Tracks like \u201cAtlas Rise!\u201d, \u201cSpit Out The Bone\u201d and \u201cMoth into Flame\u201d are the fast crowd pleasers. Especially \u201cSpit Out the Bone\u201d is the star track of the whole album, it has amazing riffs and chops and James delivers his all on the vocals. Kirks solo work on the track is top notch and Robert provides rumbling distortion bass throughout the track with a segment of the song solely focusing on his performance. Lars is well Lars, but the drumming is to the point and he plays in the pocket, he provides some great double kick drumming in a section of the songs which really complements the fury of the track. \n\nAfter listening to Metallica\u2019s latest album release, it\u2019s now safe to say that for any fan who had a shimmer of hope that they would converge back to that pure, raw and unfiltered angst of their 80\u2019s musical output that had fans yearning for, won\u2019t be happening. \n\nSadly, this seems like a plague that has befallen the big 4 of thrash throughout their winding careers but at least bands like Megadeth and Anthrax did provide exciting new material this year and have been more or less consistent throughout their musical output while at the same time evolving, taking notice of and assimilating the talent arising from young bands who are crossing the Rubicon of musicianship into uncharted territory. But Metallica and Slayer, especially Metallica had been treading the swamp of redundancy for such a long period that it would have been extremely mortifying if they delivered another failure of an album.\n\nIn sum the album receives a passing grade, thankfully it wasn\u2019t a stinker but it still wasn\u2019t legit Metallica running on all 12 cylinders, instead we got 8 cylinders. The band just doesn\u2019t offer their outrageous angst that they had in their youth but certainly does flirt with the concept through and through the album. They just frankly don\u2019t care and don\u2019t cultivate that anger anymore. I think the main reason behind this alleviated expression is mostly just the age of the bands members and the fortune that Metallica has amassed. When you are rich you frankly can\u2019t unleash the hounds of hate, your mind is at ease and you drift off into other territories of thoughts and feelings. Another problem with the album which is also related to my previous point is that there aren't enough fast tempo songs, most tracks just take comfort in mid-tempo riffage and it does make the album mill about for too long. The production and mixing & mastering of the album is exceptional. All instruments sound natural and the crisp and overdriven tone of the guitars really are a driving force behind the music. It\u2019s also great to see the bass talk throughout the album, hopefully they didn\u2019t pull a \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d and just render the bass dead and mute. \n\n Highlight Tracks: \n\n Spit Out the Bone \n Moth into Flame \n Hardwired \n Atlas, Rise! \n",
        "\nMetallica finally is back, after eight long years since their last record. In the year of 1991, with the release of their self-titled album, lots of fans despised the new sound of the band. In the following releases, the band decided to give up all the thrash metal roots and follow a hard rock with some southern rock influences, making another set of fans giving up of them and fueling the haters. In 2003, for St. Anger., the strange decision of removing solos and raw production were considered a declaration of war against the fans. With a return to the thrash roots in 2008 with Death Magnetic, the band started following the right path to bring back their old fans again. With this release, they finally found the path to rescue the fans that were disappointed with the band. Hardwired... To Self-Destruct is their best album since 91 and their strongest effort since ...And Justice For All.\n\nA great point to add about this album is how he is extremely varied. Do you miss the old agression from their early albuns? No problem, you can check \u201cHardwired\u201d and the new thrash metal anthem called \u201cSpit Out The Bone\u201d. Honestly, i never thought that Metallica could make a song like this anymore. Songs like \u201cMoth Into Flame\u201d , \u201cHalo On Fire\u201d and \u201cAtlas, Rise\u201d show that Lars decided to have some extra lessons. We see a drummer trying to get out of his comfort zone that followed him through decades, a true surprise. \n\nAre you a fan of the more heavy metal approach? No problem. Songs like \u201cNow That We\u2019re Dead\u201d, \u201cConfusion\u201d, \u201cManUNkind\u201d, \u201cHere Comes Revenge\u201d and \u201cAm I Savage\u201d will make you happy and with a lot of nostalgia. The song that really surprises here is \u201cDream No More\u201d. The song can be described like a crossover of Black Sabbath and Alice Chains with lyrics about Cthulhu awakening. Metallica here has some Load and Reload sound but almost heading in the doom metal direction. They show here that you don\u2019t need to be fast to be heavy. In interviews, Metallica always said how Lemmy inspired them, it is no secret for us. Like everyone knows, Lemmy passed away in the last December, so they decided to make a tribute to him in the song \u201cMurder One\u201d, entirely dedicated to him. Don\u2019t expect a rock anthem in Motorhead style. It is a slow, heavy and melancholic song. A beautiful, simple and direct tribute. \n\nThe bonus cd of the deluxe edition has the new version of the already released song \u201cLords Of Summer\u201d. The is now a little different: has alternative lyrics in some sections, it is shorter, has a better production and sounds more heavier and faster than the first pass version. I would dare to say that it was a sin leave it out from the regular version edition, puting it as a bonus track because it is one of the best songs they ever did. The covers are already known for being released before in tributes albums. The Rainbow cover is called \u201cRonnie Rising Medley\u201d and shows the band paying respect in a very decent and well done way to several classic songs from the early years of Rainbow with Dio. The others covers are \u201cWhen A Blind Man Cries\u201d from Deep Purple and \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d from Iron Maiden. They are pretty well played and mixed.\n\nJames Hetfield sings better than ever in this record, accepting his age and doing the best he can. Lars Ulrich shows an energy that we all thought that was lost with the past years. Robert Trujillo has a great performance proving to everyone that he deserves to be in the band but Kirk Hammet is the only guy here that decided to stay in the comfort zone. His solos are pretty commom but effective. Only in \u201cHalo On Fire\u201d and \u201cSpit Out The Bone\u201d we see him trying to do something more creativity but we can consider his job here more decent than on Death Magnetic.\n\nThe veredict of Hardwired... To Self Destruct is an album with a familiar sound and pushing forward to the future. We find epic tunes with melody and fury that only Metallica knows exactly how to do and several riffs that can be considered the best of them in decades. With almost four decades of history, they transcended the time to make their fans still curious about this release and delivered their best effort in almost 30 years. Long live Metallica!\n",
        "\nNever thought I will review a Metallica album... I never liked them that much and they never were one of the bands to introduce me to metal. Manowar and Dimmu Borgir did that so many winters ago. But truth be told, this album feels as one of their most natural since Ride the Lightning and their most diverse and interesting since their self-titled opus, if only slightly better. Yeah, for me their ballads were always getting old fast and did not connect with me, but I cannot deny their effort to explore other artistic path (with emphasis on effort). Fast forward to 2016, and we get this.\n\nAs everybody else, I got hyped when the three singles appeared, and I really like two of them (hint: they are the longest ones). And I mean really, really like them. It's just that I felt they have one major problem - they don't reach their full potential. The UMPH is not really felt, but somehow you can deduce it. And then it hit me \u2013 the whole damn album it's too fucking slow! The rhythm section needs more vitriol, more adrenaline, more fire, more passion, more drive, and more speed. Seriously, turn the whole damn thing to 125% play speed and feel the result. It's so much better! And I blame it all on Lars Ulrich.\n\nOk, the whole band is to blame, but it is extremely clear that the drums need someone who could handle the whole affair. Even Spit Out the Bone manages to sound better sped up! Not to mention the first track... Lars is getting too old for the job, and it's a premature aging, due to lack of practice, some say even inadequate playing style, and I must admit that the lack of coaching, or just proper coaching (so as to avoid being myself a jackass), is seen, as this guy clearly never really learned how to really play on the skins. I am not a drummer myself, but I think that in life, whatever your area of interests and expertise, you need/must/have to/WILL progress, because it is something natural. And if you reach 50 and regress (if only it were just stagnation!), your success, if there is one, is due to climbing on someone else's back and enjoying the ride...\n\nNow, for the real talent in the band. As much as I hated James' voice since 1991 onwards, here he just nailed it! He really found a niche he needed to have, that fills a gap somewhere between 1988 and 1991. He can sing, but can shout as well. At times, I even imagine Chuck Billy when he wasn't growling and, for some laughter, on the third track, Now That We're Dead, I thought they brought Dave Mustaine for a guest performance and forgot to give him credit. I mean, listen to the damn track! You can NOT miss it!\n\nThe riffing; ah, the riffs! There is a reason why I mentioned the vocalists of two long standing bands, all 30+ years of noise making. You can feel a vintage vibe coming from the guitar department, even going back to the '70s. Don't want to assume that this is the band's swansong, but all the effort seems to be tributary to all their musical influences back when they thought they were playing NWOBHM-inspired American metal, and, of course, to their own past. Now, it's not theft or self-plagiarism (hear Black Thrash Attack by comparison), but the whole trip listening the album felt like I was listening and headbanging to a history \"paper\" about what Metallica was and managed to become. Let's take some examples: Hardwired=Kill 'Em All; Atlas Rise=Iron Maiden (Number of the Beast period), Spit Out the Bone=...And Justice For All, and Am I Savage?=you must be retarded if you don't get this one! I mean it's in the fucking title...\n\nNow, I have one comment on the rest of the band. First of all, and I don't care how much of a douche I will look after this statement, but Kirk Hammet it's laughable. Millions of dollars cannot buy intelligence or mask stupidity! When your money maker is your riff-creating brain, your apt hands, and your precious guitar, than you know you have to protect them. Why on Earth did this guy not back up his compositions on something other than his phone?! Ok, he managed to create some solos, they sound like everything he ever did, but come on, man! You flushed your years of work, because you did not manage to take care of something slightly smaller than a brick?! Which is not a brick?! That is totally unprofessional, not to mention dumb! And age is not an excuse - I know people not technological inclined who manage to take care of less important assets, AND which don't affect their career as much as a phone carrying riffs enough for four fucking albums!!! Another one who loves enjoying the ride! Enough said... At least Trujillo has his bass leads and gets some credit on composing and providing great additional vocals on Moth in Flame.\n\nThere is one more thing to say about the album. The second disc is dull. Even sped up, I recall listening to The Black Album and found the groove riffing dull, insipid, artificial, contrived etc. At times, I am reminded of Pantera, which is not a good thing. Grooviness is good, but my take on it is that it should not be something more than a transitional tool in composing, something that could lead to something else, as an instrument of progression, but never as a leading element. And that is where both The Black Album and Pantera failed. As a result, except Am I Savage?, for obvious reasons, and the final track, most of the second disk felt like one fucking pedestrian affair, without pause or variation.\n\nTo sum it up: first disk is the better one, with more progressive and diverse elements, where everybody shine, to each one's extent, and with their really now known limits. The second one is more early 90's-ish, in the bad way, as it doesn't offer much to the table, except for two tracks. As a whole, the album is not great, not awesome, because the members were never that geniuses, but if there is something I would recommend to the listener or the fan, is: 1. after you properly hear it, speed it up to 125% at least and compare the results; 2. if you like history, and this band has made history, try viewing it as a paper written with notes (if the metaphor sticks with you). It is nostalgic, vintage (good and bad), and a sign that these guys really don't have many regrets when it comes to their past. And that's a statement we all need to think about.\n",
        "\nFor most of my life as a metal fan, I was never that into Metallica. Too young to have experienced them in their prime and lived through the fever pitch of their hype, I didn\u2019t get why they were regarded so highly.\n\nIt was only much later that I began to understand that I\u2019d been listening to Metallica all wrong. Metallica isn\u2019t about playing as fast as possible, it\u2019s not about who can shred the best, it\u2019s not about dual guitar harmonies; it\u2019s about moods, hooks, grooves, dynamics and structure \u2013 the fundamentals of a great piece of popular music.\n\n\u201cHardwired\u2026 to Self-Destruct\u201d should remind us all why Metallica are one of the top-selling artists of all time. The album is a collection of songs which showcase their formidable command of the fundamentals. This is a band that can take a superficially simple idea and run a hundred miles with it. A little shift in the groove here, a little rhythmic idiosyncrasy there, it all keeps the music fresh, without losing the listener by abandoning a pattern they\u2019ve been familiarised with with and moving onto an entirely new idea.\n\nThe album is packed with five-star metal riffing, just as you'd hope for from one of the all-time greats of the art. But Metallica is not content to merely play a good riff and move on. Each guitar motif is given a chance to strut its stuff, squeezing into as many rhythmic outfits as it can before it leaves the catwalk. Like \"Master of Puppets\" and \"... And Justice For All\", most of the songs on \"Hardwired...\" clock in at over six and a half minutes long, yet, as with those albums, the songs do not feel bloated or over-long because the creative dexterity of the band allows them to play around a concept for longer than most bands could manage.\n\nOn a first listen, a few of the rhythms and structures can sound a little disjointed and thrown-together \u2013 but then, that\u2019s true of \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d. Remember the first time you heard \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d? It sounded like a plodding mess, right? Yet, after a few listens, you knew it was a masterpiece. A large part of the joy of a Metallica album is being challenged by Hetfield and Ulrich\u2019s unique approach to groove and the way they experiment with the rhythm and structure of a track. Among other things, it is this that made their first five records so heavy and engaging.\n\n\u201cHardwired\u2026\u201d belongs alongside those first five records. It is Metallica playing in the way that made Metallica\u2019s brand of metal unique and exciting in the first place. There are dozens of thrash bands putting out faster, more aggressive records, but none of them have such a natural flair for the fundamentals of a good song and none of them groove like Metallica.\n\nIf there is anything negative to say about this album, it is to highlight a fault that it shares with the majority of modern LP releases: there are too many songs. The length of metal records has been bloating since the 1990s and \u201cHardwired\u2026\u201d, like so many of its 21st Century peers, can come across as boring to a listener trying to hear it in one sitting. This isn\u2019t because the individual tracks are boring or too similar \u2013 they aren\u2019t - it\u2019s because there are simply too many of them and it\u2019s throwing the pacing of the album off.\n\nI understand that in an age where digital track downloads are so important, it makes economic sense to put as many songs on a record as possible. However, the downside is that, when experiencing \u201cHardwired\u2026\u201d traditionally as a complete work, it does have a tendency to drag. On a first listen, you may find yourself bored and wanting to skip forward - it was only after listening to the tracks piecemeal that I started to enjoy some of the mid-tempo songs like \u201cConfusion\u201d or \u201cManUnkind\u201d and appreciate how interesting they actually were. By leaving out just a couple of songs \u2013 \u201cMurder One\u201d and \u201cAm I Savage?\u201d are probably the weakest \u2013 Metallica might have ended up with a more cohesive, entertaining album.\n\nBut ultimately, it is entertaining. Metallica are back and sounding like Metallica (with a hint of Sabbath and Alice in Chains on a few tracks). The production woes of \u201cSt. Anger\u201d and \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d are banished to the past and the instruments sound tight and the dynamics good. Like Zeppelin, Metallica is a band that works so well because they are four musicians who play very instinctively in each other\u2019s groove and, even though Lars\u2019 drumming may not match his '80s work, the band\u2019s performance is effortlessly natural throughout the album - refreshingly old-school in an age of soulless, quantized metal albums. James Hetfield remains one of metal's most iconic vocalists and, on \"Hardwired...\", he sounds better than he has done in years. There are some nice bass breaks from Rob Trujillo and he really helps hold together stand-out thrash track \"Spit Out The Bone\" and modernise the band's sound. Kirk Hammett has never been metal's most diverse or exciting lead player, but his leads are well-structured and tasteful and he and his wah pedal do exactly what they need to in order to let the great rhythm guitars shine.\n\n\"Hardwired... To Self-Destruct\" is a must-have for fans of classic metal that eclipses anything Metallica has released in the last 25 years. I only hope we don\u2019t have to wait another eight years to hear new music from this band!\n",
        "\nMetallica's new album, eight years in the making, is a surprise if only for how totally solid and ass-kicking it actually is. While I've appreciated what they've done for some time, if only for how experimental and raw they got and how little I could ever predict what they'd do next, this is a really good, solid album of heavy metal. I suppose in that respect, in that I expected this to be rawer, scrappier and more disappointing, Hardwired... to Self Destruct is another curveball in a career full of them, in its own ironic way.\n\nThis is really a surprisingly consonant, agreeable, melodic ass-kicking in comparison to the oft-jagged edges that marred works like Death Magnetic or St. Anger. The songs on here, while they are of similar lengths, go down easier due to the better writing and more melodic structures. There's a lot of the foreboding and aggression of their earliest albums, though the hooks can sometimes recall their 1990s output as well, more radio-friendly and hard rock style. It really sort of encapsulates all their various eras to some degree.\n\nBut it works. This is a seriously addictive album, and it's mostly down to James Hetfield. He sounds great vocally, with more range here and a more comfortable style, a bit less aggressive than Death Magnetic. All these songs have really good vocal hooks. On guitar, he excels too \u2013 every song is full of big, pounding metal riffs that use the band's potpourri of influence \u2013 a heaping dose of thrash, some southern rock swagger and groove... a lot of that stuff. Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett add their own signature stylings \u2013 though it's really James that comes out as the most inspired on here.\n\nSongwise, there are no real weak tracks and the writing has improved since last time out, with less of the forced instrumental sections that made Death Magnetic a bit grueling to sit through and more melodic tendencies to make the songs flow better. The production is super clean and that tends to lend a 'dad rock' sort of feel to everything \u2013 maybe it could be a bit heavier with more of an edge to it, and the album might work better. And sometimes the songs could possibly hit harder or be more aggressive in places. But those are surprisingly small critiques compared to what I expected to have to say about this. This is quite an improvement over anything they've done in years, really.\n\nOn songs like the propulsive rocker \u201cAtlas, Rise!\u201d or the doomy Alice In Chains-style \u201cDream No More,\u201d the band sounds totally on point and energized \u2013 the whole first disc is very entertaining. \u201cHalo On Fire\u201d deserves special mention \u2013 a very cool, epic track with searing dark melodies and a great stomping riff and chorus set that has a lot more mournful, evocative atmosphere than I ever expected from Metallica in 2016. This song isn't really much like any one older track of the band's (which is a credit to their songwriting that they aren't just aping their classics), but it's got a very late-70s or early-80s rock/metal feel to it, a sort of wistful atmosphere, that I find entrancing.\n\nThe second disc starts off strong with \u201cConfusion,\u201d another 80s-style metal headbanger with a great riff and a super catchy chorus from Hetfield the way you expect \u2013 but it's so, so satisfying when done this well. After that it gets admittedly weaker, as even when tracks like \u201cHere Comes Revenge\u201d or \u201cManUNkind\u201d are in full groove, they can't quite hit home and end up feeling more like rimshots or B-sides. Then there's a few slower, doomier tracks again \u2013 though not as good as \u201cDream No More\u201d by a long shot, never quite hitting a stride. \u201cMurder One\u201d is a Lemmy from Motorhead tribute, and it's not bad, with a very Motorheadesque grimy groove to it, but it's played a touch too slow to really sound as urgent as it should. Fortunately closer \u201cSpit Out The Bone\u201d is so fucking cool \u2013 a thrashing headbanger with Hetfield at his most urgent and pissed off, and with screaming, raging guitars. Killer.\n\nI guess we just can't quit Metallica \u2013 even after all the controversy and bizarre experiments, here we are listening to them yet again, dissecting the music at every turn, talking about the band even with so many younger bands maybe more deserving of the talk. I think it's because in spite of everything, Metallica still know how to entertain. They write music that gets your fucking blood pumping and your limbs moving and your car going a bit over the speed limit. It's just got that id factor, the primal, dirty thrash and the grooving riffs and the heavy thumping beat that hits you in the soul. Music is an emotional thing, after all \u2013 all the intellectualism and the analyses in the world can't take that away, and most of us will always end up just enjoying something that flat out kicks ass in whatever way we like, no other explanations needed.\n\nSo that's why Metallica are still important. They know what they're doing and they sell it like the pros they are, and that's why they've kept in the public peripheral all these years, even though we've tried to forget. Hardwired is a legit good album. I recommend it.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s been quite some time since Death Magnetic hit the shelves; eight years of wait has built up some serious expectations for Metallica\u2019s tenth studio album. Now, I\u2019m not the kind of person who decided before I heard it that I\u2019d hate this album - and I don\u2019t, because there are some great moments on it - nor am I a fanboy who will worship every single thing the band puts out. The event was further built up by the singles three, which sadly contain two of the strongest tracks on this album.\n\n\u2018Atlas Rise!\u2019 is without doubt one of Metallica\u2019s fleshiest and coolest tracks in 25 years, hitting every note right - in spite of a section that blatantly rips of Maiden\u2019s \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019. Hetfield carries some quality vocal melodies throughout the album, but mostly there\u2019s nothing very invigorating there. The same goes for a sometimes bland bass, and of course Ulrich\u2019s drumming - sometimes on point, but mostly just nailed for the studio effort. Don\u2019t expect some of these songs to be played live, as Ulrich will have a hard time recreating it.\n\nStill, the Bay Area legends do put in some heavy instrumental parts that go way beyond the mere ordinary. Moth Into Flame and emotive Halo On Fire both carry this mark, where the music seems more real and genuine than on some of the duller tracks. Most songs are overlong, dragging the album up to almost 80 minutes. There\u2019s plenty of mid tempo tracks that invoke a \u201890s feel, but with a heavier production that\u2019s - thank the lord - gives more depth and diversity than that of Death Magnetic (2008), and the sound is definitely heavy and crunchy. However, the lacklustre parts are in the song writing itself. The songs drag on for too long, mostly carrying anonymous riffage, boring rhythms and cringe inducing lyrics.\n\nSimply put, too much on here sticks to mid tempo, especially on the second disc, where most every song is forgettable. The mid tempo wall can work rather well, if you incorporate some sludge or groove sense to the music (which Metallica has not) to give the slowness purpose. It works in \u2018Dream No More\u2019, which while slightly too long clearly beats crappy tracks like \u2018ManUNkind\u2019 and \u2018Am I Savage?\u2019. The aforementioned \u2018Halo On Fire\u2019 is also track worthy of mention in that it carries some trademark Metallica movements, emotive and deep. You just keep waiting for that full on explosion to carry the song off into the stuff of legend, but it never comes and then the song just kind of... disappears into the back of your head.\n\nAs I stated earlier however, there are some great moments on Hardwired... To Self Destruct. \u2018Atlas Rise!\u2019 being the obvious highlight, but also \u2018Moth Into Flame\u2019 with its flashy guitar work and instrumental passages. \u2018Spit Out The Bone\u2019 then ends the album on a high note, showing marks of the thrash everyone wanted but didn\u2019t get. Fast, aggressive and hard, it\u2019s exactly the right way to end an album. Even Ulrich is on point. Why more of the album couldn\u2019t go in the same vein I know not. I do know that this album does carry too much of the Load/Reload feeling in style and feel, and carries on the Death Magnetic vein of being too fucking long, but the few moments of excellence do show here and there. Had the album been scaled down to carry the bare essentials, the quality had been increased and the experience drastically improved. Musically, Hardwired... To Self Destruct won\u2019t go down in history, although the album cover certainly might in the \u201cUgliest\u201d category.\n\nStandout tracks: Atlas Rise!, Moth Into Flame, Spit Out The Bone\n",
        "\nMetallica should have just stopped before this album. They are too old to continue making music. Even though bands like Slayer and Exodus and Testament are in their 50s and still performing and writing great metal music. But they are rather more underground bands that have underground fanbases. This band however, is very mainstream, and I wouldn't be half surprised if this album reached number 1 on the Billboard charts for at least 2 weeks. Well, Load, ReLoad, and St. Anger reached number 1, so why not. Lars has well improved his drumming on songs like Hardwired and Spit Out the Bone. His drumming sucked on Death Magnetic, and this is a step in the right direction for Lars, but it still sucks on some songs.\n\nOne of the bad things from this album is James voice. His voice has completely failed after he blew out his vocal cords on a performance of So What from 1992. He can't sing anymore. He actually sings really well on the live version of Hardwired and Spit Out the Bone from the second side of the album. He kinda sounds angrier on Spit Out the Bone, matching the fast music, which is only rivaled by the very first track, Hardwired. Most of his other singing are Load-esque, like in Dream No More. The only thing that saves that song from being the worst song on the album is the Cthulhu lyrics. You should listen to \"The Call of Ktulu\" from Ride the Lightning after this song.\n\nAlso, the songs are too long. Every intro takes at least 1/6 of the song, even Hardwired has a long intro, considering the length of the song. All the other songs are like 7 minutes long so the intros are more than a minute on average. Hardwired was good because it was not only fast, but it's not long either, being their shortest song since \"Motorbreath\" from Kill 'Em All, while Spit Out the Bone was one of the longest songs on the album at 7 minutes, but has enough interesting content to be good. All the other songs are lost Load tracks like \"Now That We're Dead\" and, as I mentioned earlier \"Dream No More\". The longest song on the album is the worst song on the album. The only thing that keeps Halo on Fire from being absolutely abysmal is the solo improv at the end.\n\nIt's also with this album that they're still stealing riffs, from not just Dave Mustaine (countless songs) and Exodus (Impaler and Hells Breath). Even though I don't think Metallica has ever heard of Obituary, the beginning riff in Confusion kinda sounds like Slowly We Rot. \"Atlas Rise\" sound like Iron Maiden if they did a version of Enter Sandman. You could also spot original riffs from Kill 'Em All like Motorbreath in the song \"Spit Out the Bone\". Moth into Flame sounds like a direct ripoff of Disposable Heroes from Master of Puppets.\n\nThere is also no balls at all. Thrash in the general sense has tons of balls, with albums like Bonded by Blood by Exodus and Hell Awaits by Slayer being legit masterpieces because there's so much balls in those albums. Even Metallica had balls while starting out on their first few albums like Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning, even if they did have ballads like \"Fade to Black\". They started to lose their balls when Cliff Burton died, while songs like \"Blackened\" and \"Dyers Eve\" from And Justice for All had balls, it is mostly progressive nonsense, they had completely lost their balls whilst touring the Black Album at around 1993. They just don't sound like they're angry, that they're just trying to be angry to impress their fans, but they just can't do that anymore. That's why they sound bad live in songs like \"Master of Puppets\" because they just can't go that far anymore. They've gotten too old for a lot of their older songs from their glory days in the 80s when they werent the most popular metal band. Even though they were crap in the 90s, Iron Maiden still makes good music, reminiscent of their great 80s albums. Popularity is not always a factor, but for this band it is. Also, the lyrics suck because they have no balls. Even songs like \"Hardwired\" have teen angsty lyrics.\n\nWhat about the good stuff on this album? I could go on endlessly about the flaws on this album, but what about the good things on this album. \"Spit Out the Bone\" and \"Hardwired\" are the best tracks here, because \"Spit Out the Bone\" is fast and angry and interesting and \"Hardwired\" is fast and short. Hardwired is not the best song on this album, for the lyric problem above, and it has a very short solo, but it was still decent. This also is one of my favorite tracks because this is the fastest song on the album, and the next song that would be fast is \"Spit Out the Bone\" the last track on the album, and also the best. \"Spit Out the Bone\" does suffer from a long intro, but it's actually a good intro, and when the verses kick in it sounds absolutely amazing. The solos on this song are very good. This is basically showing that Metallica can still do good melodic songs. James voice sounds like he's actually angry. These songs are what happen when you try, Metallica. Murder One is also a good tribute to Lemmy the great. Mot\u00f6rhead is the most solid band ever. One of their albums \"We Are Mot\u00f6rhead\" was released in 2000, when the nu metal craze had come to its absolute peak, and still sounds like \"Overkill\" from 1979, when they were doing something nobody had done before, by putting speed before anything else. Murder One is mainly good because of the great shredding solo. Kirk Hammett can still play solos, also shown when he guest appeared on Exodus's modern thrash masterpiece \"Blood In, Blood Out\" from 2014, playing one of the solos in \"Salt the Wound\". Here Comes Revenge, has a couple good riffs, good lyrics, a decent solo, and a Justice style intro, but the only bad part comes right after the intro, when the drumming beat that a thousand mallcore bands plays over a Load-esque riff. That should have belonged in a song like Halo on Fire, but Here Comes Revenge is still a solid song.\n\nOverall, this has 4 good tracks, 4 mixed bags, and 4 horrible tracks. This is also what happens when you get too popular and too old. I'd prefer Death Magnetic to this. Death Magnetic, while having bad drumming and bad vocals, still had good songs like \"All Nightmare Long\" and \"My Apocalypse\". But this album contains more NWOBHM influenced riffs, like \"Atlas Rise\", and more thrash influenced riffs like \"Moth into Flame\" and \"Hardwired\" and \"Spit Out the Bone\". James vocals, the horrible songs, and the awful cover art give this album a 57%, and if not for those things it would have gotten at least a 75%. If you buy this album, listen to the whole thing because the second disc is much better than the first.\n",
        "\nIt's been far too long since we got a new Metallica album. Eight years too long. Back in August, when Hardwired...to Self-Destruct was announced and the title-track released, I was skeptical. It was far too simple. Thankfully, the rest of the album is much better than what I believe the weakest song since the Load/Reload era.\n\nThis is the first double album in Metallica's career (Lulu excluded), and the way the songs are divided is very good; the first CD being faster, more like 80's a Metallica, while the second is slower, more epic (there are exceptions on either CD, of course). CD 1 features the three songs that were released as singles: Hardwired, Atlas, Rise! and Moth into Flame. Hardwired is pretty boring, uninspired and, I believe, was just written to please the fans that can't accept that Metallica changed after ...And Justice for All. The next five songs on the CD are a big step-up, Atlas, Rise! having a very catchy chorus that reminds me a lot of the first two Iron Maiden albums. Moth into Flame is very melodic and my favorite among the singles. Dream No More is my favorite song on the CD. It is slow, crushing and heavy as fuck. It feels like a tribute to classic doom metal, mainly Master Of Reality- Black Sabbath, and the lyrics are about our lord and Savior, Cthulhu. What else can you ask for in a Metallica song?\n\nThe second CD is my favorite of the two, mainly because here all the songs are sick. ManUnkind is the most unexpected tune in the whole album. It feels a tribute to Mercyful Fate, which is nice. The video for said song is even more unexpected, featuring a black metal band \"playing\" the song and paying tribute to Mayhem. Murder One is a tribute to Lemmy, who passed away last year. As James said in the very last Big 4 concert five years ago: \"the godfather of metal. whether he likes it or not, he is.\" The music is slower than I expected when they announced it was gonna be a tribute to Lemmy, but maybe that's why it stands out: it's not what anyone expected. The lyrics tell Lemmy's way of life, and the video tells his story. Spit out the Bone is, arguably, the heaviest Metallica song along with Dyers Eve. I bet no one expected this song to be this heavy, or for it to have a bass solo (the first with any bassist other than Cliff). My favorite song along with Dream No More from the record.\n\nThe bonus CD for the deluxe edition features a now properly recorded and produced version of Lords of Summer. It is much better than that demo released back in 2014; the lyrics on the pre-chorus and the last line of the chorus are different, the solo is different, and the middle section is about a minute shorter. All these changes are for the better. Then come a bunch of covers a live songs that one can live without, but are not bad.\n\nOverall, I love this album. I'm still not sure where I'd rank it among the rest of their releases, but it would definitely be top 5. It is more bluesy and varied than Death Magnetic, but still surpasses it. I would recommend this to anyone that has ears and is not close-minded when it comes to Metalllica. One of the best albums this year. And the videos for each song were a nice way to promote it and they are very creative.\n",
        "\nI came into this album with relatively low expectations, hearing about \"groove\" and \"like the black album\"- I like the black album, but the idea of not-as-good-as-91 James singing over nowhere-near-as-good-as-91 production wasn't a hugely appealing idea. But Hardwired, while undeniably rather overlong, is far better than I imagined; and I've found myself reverting back to a 15 year old in that since this leaked a week or so ago I haven't listened to anything else, and I don't really want to listen to anything else.\n\nThe word I keep on coming back to is 'natural'. It's not an often good if somewhat forced Death Magnetic return to form. It's not a (only very occasionally good) and somewhat forced Lulu. I certainly get the vibe here that Metallica are perhaps for the first time totally relaxed and happy to write some riffs without overthinking it. There's been nothing as obviously arena rock as \"Now That We're Dead\" since perhaps Enter Sandman, and I'd argue that it succeeds because it's confident in what it is- a great vocal performance, a few very simple riffs, and Lars just doing a total butt rock thing (plus he discovered toms again!).\n\nThe rest of the album is less accessible, but this is no Portal/Merzbow collaboration. Most of the songs are happy to move between Justice/Black/Load, often featuring a bluesy touch of the latter, the fairly complex song structures of the former and a tendency towards the tempos of the self titled. Be nice if there were a few faster bits, as most of the really strong, the \"man, that is totally killer\" moments like the title track, Moth into Flame's ridiculously good verse/pre chorus, and the behemoth that's the album closer tend towards the higher tempos.\n\nThat said, I reckon there's a lot of gold here. The general tendency in most songs is that James sounds really good, there's a few really good riffs in almost every song, the bass is the most obvious it's been since Puppets- and it sounds great- and while Kirk has dropped the ball a bit Lars does his best drumming since, I dunno, at least Load, if not much earlier. There's a lot of dual leads which is a pretty great thing- Halo On Fire's somewhat proggy noodles, Atlas Rise's super neato melodic bridge, Spit Out the Bone's sweet, gloomy as bridge. I have to wonder if Hetfield's been listening to a bit of a prog because there's a fair few obvious weird time signatures. It's not Dream Theatre, but it's somewhat annoying to airdrum- all these unusual accents and extra beats here and there.\n\nLet's not pretend everything's perfect though. The \"it's way overlong\" criticism is a valid one. Too many songs and many of the songs carry on a bit long. Now That We're Dead is a sweet little arena metal tune, and has absolutely no reason being almost 7 minutes long. Throughout the album, Metallica have this irritating tendency to extend the outros for every song, when quite often a quick in, out and done after the 3rd chorus would perfectly suffice. Honestly, it's rather odd that most of the tunes are like this, because otherwise they seem very meticulously arranged, only for a long, attention sapping outro. And yes, too many songs- I get the idea behind Murder One but it's a pretty damned boring tune; one wonders why they didn't go more for a \"faster version of Overkill\" for a Lemmy tribute- that would've worked wonders.\n\nIt would've been cool for Metallica to attempt something new as well, as except for perhaps the closer (which is the best track on here), you get the feeling that they're chilling out in a comfort zone here. Comfort zones often produce pretty good albums but rarely great ones- and this is a pretty good example. A few more thrash laden epics, where new ideas and big, apocalyptic vistas are painted would've been great. Similarly, while, say, \"Confusion\" isn't a bad song- very catchy chorus, some very cool riffs- it doesn't really do anything that hasn't already been done a few million times already, coming across as a slightly heavier Load track; slightly above mid tempo but never really going anywhere particularly cool or interesting.\n\nIs this a classic? Probably not. Am I going to listen to this for the next three months non-stop until I hate the album and myself? Definitely. It's a really entertaining album with plenty of really cool moments, well produced and just super fun to listen to. Honestly, you probably already have an opinion on this but if you're on the fence on it I highly recommend you give it a chance.\n",
        "\nWell, here it is. It's finally here. Metallica's highly anticipated tenth studio album \"Hardwired...to Self-Destruct\". Starting two months back when Metallica put out the balls to the wall, pure thrash title track, I was immensely excited to see what the rest of the album would bring. We eventually got two more songs to nibble on, \"Moth Into Flame\" and \"Atlas, Rise!\" to hold us over for the remainder of the album and while \"Atlas\" was a little underwhelming at first, it was not bad, and these songs only amplified my excitement. Metallica, in my opinion, did extremely well with \"Death Magnetic\" eight years ago, minus the production, and this album seems to differ quite a bit. While I was initially a little disappointed with the album's more hard rock/heavy metal approach, it has since grown on me, and I'd say this is the best from these guys since \"...And Justice for All\" from 28 years ago. I know I'm not alone with that opinion.\n\nI first heard this album when it leaked last weekend and was kind of taken back from it upon the first few listens. I was really expecting, and hoping, that they would make a full return to their 80's thrash style. While there are songs that do this, mainly \"Hardwired\", \"Moth Into Flame\", and especially \"Spit Out the Bone\", it seems most of this blends the styles heard on the band's 1991 eponymous album and a little bit of \"Load\" and \"ReLoad\" thrown in. Actually, this either sounds like the missing link between \"...And Justice for All\" and \"Metallica\", or the missing link between \"Metallica\" and \"Load\" had the band decided to try and return to thrash after the 1991 release. Either way, this album is not a pure thrash album, nor is it a completely 90's sounding Metallica album. In fact, it kind of takes the best of the 90's, for the most part, and sprinkles some of that thrash metal sound on top.\n\nThe guitars. Wow, the guitars. As with most Metallica albums, there is a lot going on in that department. The solos here are far better than the ones we got with \"Death Magnetic\". \"Halo on Fire\" contains one of the best offerings of solos from Kirk Hammett (happy birthday, by the way) and closes out with one of the album's finest, while \"Hardwired\" has a very simplistic approach. The riffs are full of bite in most of these songs and really rock. A lot of these songs end up melding thrash riffing with that hard rock style. \"Confusion\" starts off fairly aggressive yet controlled, maybe sounding like one of the tamer songs from \"Ride the Lightning\". It ends up softening but still has plenty of energy throughout. This is the album's war-themed track as portrayed in its respective music video. \"Murder One\", which is a moving tribute to Lemmy (R.I.P.) of Mot\u00f6rhead. It begins with a somber intro that actually sounds a bit similar to \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" from \"Master of Puppets\". And man, that solo. The melody on this album is absolutely amazing and is even present in the album's most aggressive track \"Spit Out the Bone\". This is my favorite from the album. It is the closing track and really blends that classic thrash with a ton of melody, specifically around the 4-minute mark after the first guitar solo. This section is a defining element here and the second solo completely blows me away every time. \n\nWe all know Lars Ulrich is quite a douche but I will say his performance here is stellar. It's not his absolute best but I will say, like the album, since \"...And Justice for All\", this is certainly him at his peak. The thrash drumming in \"Hardwired\" and \"Spit Out the Bone\" is typical and predictable but highly effective, and the latter track has some amazing double bass work. The same could be said for \"Moth Into Flame\". Also, the production here allows for the drums to be mixed pretty much perfectly with the other instruments. They don't overtake the bass or guitars this time which gives everything more room to breathe. This was a huge relief, especially because while the bass is still going to be the instrument that gets the least audio, it's still audible and we can hear it clearly. It's mixed quite well. Rob was involved with writing \"ManUNkind\" which I'll discuss in my next paragraph, and his bass solo on \"Spit Out the Bone\" is great. His work here even reminds me a bit of Cliff. \n\nI must note that not all of this album pleased me. There are two songs that disappoint me a bit, one more than the other. The first is \"Dream No More\", the first Metallica song with a theme involving Cthulhu since 1984's \"The Call of Ktulu\" instrumental epic. The song itself isn't bad musically but it sounds way too much like an Alice In Chains rip off to my ears. I love AIC, but if I wanted to listen to them, I certainly wouldn't go to Metallica for that. I'm sure this wasn't intentional but I can't stress it enough. The solo rips but most of the song just sounds uninspired due to it sounding more like a clone than anything. The second song I was underwhelmed by would be \"ManUNkind\" which has become controversial due to its music video, which seems to be a satirical black metal-themed video. I couldn't care less about the video but aside from the really cool clean intro that also highlights the bass and, it sounds somewhat lacking. Sure, it has a fairly decent solo and the melodic passages are alright, but it could have been so much more. It's better than \"Dream No More\" but with Rob being involved in the writing, I was hoping for a bigger kick in the gut than I got.\n\nJames Hetfield's vocal performance here must be noted because it's the best he has sounded this decade. Well really, probably since \"Justice\" as well. His singing is really good here and there is plenty of aggression in his voice which really harkens back to the old days. Overall, like I have been saying, this is Metallica's best in 28 years. I have really grown to like this album a lot and was surprised they decided to make a video for all the songs. I expect this album to get a lot of negativity just like any other album released since \"Metallica\" but that's just the nature of the beast. I'd still stand my ground and defend this as the thrash/heavy metal/hard rock masterpiece it is. Well done, Metallica, you aging bastards.\n",
        "\nAt this point, I\u2019m pretty sure you could write a doctoral thesis about what Metallica is in a cultural sense. This is probably the most deconstructed band since The Beatles, and the standards for which the metal community holds the band\u2019s music is \u2013 apparently \u2013 insurmountably high. Even the reviews on this site for the singles off Hardwired To Self Destruct indicate that even this album is probably going to get a chilly reception. Granted, Metallica was off their game for a good solid decade or more, but Jesus \u2013 the thing with Napster is like 16 years past and St. Anger came out in \u201903. Sour grapes, much, guys? \n\nOK, now that that\u2019s out of the way let\u2019s get into the meat & potatoes of HTSD. Dumb name? Yep. Song titles that\u2019d make Dave Mustaine cringe? Oh my, yes. Consistent thrash metal building on Death Magnetic\u2019s return to roots? YES. This isn\u2019t the most high-intensity thrash I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s not even the most high-intensity thrash coming out of the old Bay Area guard this year. But it is at least competent and enjoyable. And a noticeable step up from the mixed bag that was Death Magnetic. I\u2019m trying to be as objective as I can, of course. As much as I complained about it earlier in this review, Metallica has burned me bad in the past, too. \n\nI\u2019m gonna start off with the annoying: The album art is terrible. I don\u2019t even\u2026is it a metaphor? For, I don\u2019t know, self-destructing? As a band? Who cares: the album art gets a firm D+. Second major beef: This album has no real business being a double album. Neither disc breaks the 40 minute mark. For reference, this WHOLE album is roughly the same length as either Load or Reload. You know, two single albums. Way to play yourselves trying to look important, Metallica. Let\u2019s talk Lars, literally no one\u2019s favorite drummer or member of Metallica. PRETTY SURE he\u2019s using a healthy dose of studio tricks on HTSD. He\u2019s playing basically on beat, playing quickly AND accurately. And the double bass actually sounds like something a professional drummer in the world\u2019s biggest band should be able to do. I\u2019ll bet anyone $5 some of these songs don\u2019t ever get played in concert because Lars won\u2019t be able to replicate his performance.\n\nThe production seems to be a massive step up from Death Magnetic. It still suffers from trying to out-loud itself, but there\u2019s a lot more sonic depth here. It doesn\u2019t sound like your speakers are trying to sandblast your face off\u2026in a bad way. Check out Halo on Fire for that dynamic range your ears have been craving for 8 long years. \n\nThe songs are mostly moderately long, but \u2013 and thank God for this \u2013 they actually have a purpose for being as long as they are. The 6 and 7 minute long songs sound like they\u2019re actually going somewhere again, which is something Metallica has struggled with since \u2026And Justice for All. There\u2019s definitely something to be said for purposeful songwriting. The songs are MOSTLY thrash, but there are a few songs (Dream No More, for example) that plug along in mid-tempos. Dream No More isn\u2019t a bad song, but I think a lot of people will hate it for being \u201cgroove metal\u201d or some dumb thing. ManUNkind, idiot name aside, reminded me of a more metal-tinged version of Ain\u2019t My Bitch, which I\u2019m sure will provoke no shortage of ire. I don\u2019t know, though, maybe Metal Archives contributors will surprise me (they won\u2019t). \n\nMore specifically about the music: The melodies and riffs are decent. Here\u2019s my problem, though \u2013 they\u2019re mostly just decent. The songs are really fun and enjoyable to listen to, but there are too few earworms here. Not much really gets stuck in your head after the first listen. I imagine that repeated listens are gonna crack that problem wide open. On the other hand, there are no tracks that are clearly weak on HTSD. Now That We\u2019re Dead and Confusion are fairly forgettable, but aren\u2019t BAD. Again, another improvement in an area where Metallica has struggled for 20-some years.\n\nThis isn\u2019t classic Metallica. Let\u2019s just let that dream die: bands don\u2019t usually maintain the same level of quality 35 years later. That being said, Hardwired to Self Destruct is Metallica\u2019s strongest release since The Black Album. I think I read a professional review that the other day that said that and thought \u201cDumb, way to ride the coattails of your most successful album.\u201d But they turned out to be correct. Believe the hype (for once).\n",
        "\nOne thing I like about a new/impending Metallica album release is that I tend to revisit their older albums, and I'm forever getting something new from them. They're the sort of band that has been around long enough, and where you know the songs well enough that all these little things reveal themselves- all these little subtleties and nuances everywhere. I could've sworn I heard the bass on AJFA for the first time a few days ago, for example, so that's cool. \n\nYeah, so Puppets is a difficult album to review, like many a classic you find yourself trying to balance current context vs history. IE, \"How does it sound now\" vs \"What did it achieve, what would it have sounded like back then?\" Kinda like how Lincoln was probably a racist, but he wasn't a racist relative to other folks in 1860, or something. Or like how Hitler was a cool guy and still is! \n\nIf someone released this now, I'm pretty sure it would still be well loved. It's easy to forget just how much Master of Puppets blew us all away when we were 12 years old or so. It's not to hard to see why it did, either- it's an album that has pretty much everything and walks every middle ground perfectly. Accessible and anthemic while still maintaining an epic and progressive vibe, intelligent while still being quite working class in it's assembly and lyrical theme, fun to play on guitar.. but hard to master on guitar.\n\nListening back to it with a fresh mind and you quickly get reminded of just how good and well-thought out this album is, and right from the start too. Battery's intro is a real majestic thing (has anyone considered doing a battery intro/fight fire with fire main song mashup?) that then segues perfectly into a bunch of tight, often offtime thrash with I figure three huge main riffs that any metalhead, indeed any rock fan, could hum in their sleep. It's tight, it's extremely heavy and I still find myself banging to my head to that part near the end when Lars changes to a syncopated (I think?) beat. Most songs are pretty much the same; a medley of pretty cool, often pretty different ideas that form a seamless, near perfect whole. Disposable Heroes' 7/8 bridge and fantastically composed solo contrasted with the machine gun pre-chorus, Leper Messiah's cool tempo change and surprisingly neat drumming, or Orion's fun and endlessly proggy soloing.\n\nYou can imagine how monolithic it must've been when this album dropped. Nowadays, with our Sunn O)))s and our Blood Incantations there's plenty of out there, long form bands doing cool/crazy/interesting stuff. 30+ years ago? Well, you had Iron Maiden doing proggy stuff, but never in as muscular a form as anything on here. Cirith Ungol's King of The Dead was a beast, but the musical base lay in an older, far more chilled style of heavy metal. Slayer had Hell Awaits, and that was certainly a mean, atmospheric album, but with far less of the big, widescreen ambition of this album. Puppets wasn't the heaviest album of '86 by any means but it was a heavy album, and it was a far out album, and it was huge. It's the equivalent of Vektor's Terminal Redux or something becoming the biggest metal release of the year. It's an outlier that will probably not happen again.\n\n..It's also not a perfect album. Granted, it's close, but Lightning pips it. First up, while Orion isn't a bad tune- the bass solo is pretty mean- it has none of the coherence, of the narrative flow, of the brilliance that Call of the Ktulu had in the previous album, and it's disappointing seeing a daunting, haunting, fantastically written instrumental followed up by what is essentially a decent but fairly forgettable jam. The second moment is The Thing That Should Not Be- a bit of a disaster really, whereby a somewhat mediocre main riff is ridden into the ground in a desperate quest for doomy atmosphere. It's just not suited to the somewhat washed out, reverb heavy production- arguably the one and only thing that truly dates this album.\n\nNo, it's not perfect, but most of the album is at a level of which very few bands have touched. Compositional skills that would make Beethoven envious, songwriting skills that match The Beatles (I figure that's a compliment?)- some albums are classics for valid reasons, and this is one of them. Worth it for the historical importance but also worth it because it's a damn fine album.\n",
        "\nEight years is a long time. Such a long time, in fact, that if you are a musician and wrote as much as Metallica insist they've worked, you'd have quality songs coming out of your ears, and you'd definitely have an album's worth of those quality songs. However, I've now heard about a sixth of the content on Hardwired...to Self-Destruct and nothing is jumping out at me, saying \"I was the product of eight years' graft.\"\n\nBut to be truthful here, the amount Metallica claimed they'd worked and the amount they have don't even begin to stack up. Whilst 'Tallica fuck around advertising Italian suits and god knows what else, those ides ebb away, and when it comes time to record, something like this appears out of the woodwork.\n\nMusically, it's not bad, even good in places. There's a strong intro with some brief but nice harmonized guitars and then we go into boring riffing like \"Through the Never\" meets Dream Theater's \"The Glass Prison\". Now, these riffs may have a certain effect on the listener but there is no variance or excitement to be found. Hopefully, on \"Atlas, Rise!\" the mindless staccato leads which have dominated the first two tracks are abandoned. I'll reiterate the point: we've waited eight years for some shitty staccato riffs.\n\nLyrically and vocally, this track is decidedly worse than \"Hardwired\". The lyrics are flat and could be bettered by just about anyone with a pen and paper and knowledge of the English language. Hetfield's voice now sounds noticeably strained, and for this album he seems to be singing in a slightly higher register than past efforts if my assumption that most of the other tracks will sound somewhat like this. The \"Sold your soul\" sections are actually nice moments, reminding me of the only good track on St. Anger, \"The Unnamed Feeling\". On the other hand most of the verses suck, and Hetfield's worsening voice does little to help. I mean, check out this gem, which sums up the average verse here:\n\n\"Blacked out\nPop queen, amphetamine\nThe screams crashed into silence\"\n\nWhat. The. Fuck.\n\nIf this was my decision, I would have everyone refuse to support Hardwired until they showed that it really is worthwhile, but that won't happen. No, the real Moths into Flame here are Metallica's fans, myself unfortunately included, who allow the band to release things like this after making us wait close to a decade and still give this band the time of day and our hard-earned cash.\n",
        "\nIs... is this really the theme Metallica is going with for the single covers? Ugly shit like this? What does this Joker lookalike have to do with a song about being overwhelmed by your burdens? Fucking hell, they can't even get artwork right anymore. Tomato-faced James on the 'Hardwired' single cover was too much. This thing is just disgusting, and I can't think of a single person who would want this in their record collection. The four faces on the album's cover is neat - it worked for Queen when they released The Miracle - but that was as far as they went.\n\nOh, there's a song, too? And it's not a letdown like 'Hardwired?'\n\nIndeed it isn't, but it suffers from the same problems. 'Atlas, Rise!' is a step in the right direction in all regards, but it also doesn't have the juvenile declaration of \"We're so fucked! Shit outta luck!\" so that's not really an accomplishment. Lyrically I think it's a great metaphor for being unable to deal with your problems and collapsing from the pressure, a subject Metallica is no stranger to, and I have no doubt it will be considered a strong point from the album, along with 'Moth into Flame.' It looks like they gave up giving each song a billion different verses, because I can read the lyrics to the released tracks and not get lost. This is a change for the better, because Death Magnetic bordered on unreadable a lot of the time and, unsurprisingly, the abundance of ideas weighed the songs down. So it's nice to see a standard verse/verse/pre-chorus/chorus song from Metallica for a change.\n\nThe song is as awesome as you'd expect, but is still a victim of a creatively stagnant band. Its riffs are not attention grabbing, the change in speed from verse to pre-chorus has no impact, and the chorus itself sounds just like the rest of the song. Then there's the solo, a choppy and inconsistent baker's dozen of ideas which actually climaxes, has an ending and doesn't simply stop like the one in 'Hardwired,' but proves that Kirk has no idea how to write a solo anymore. I'm not expecting another face-melting thrill ride like the ones in 'Fight Fire with Fire,' 'One' or 'Broken, Beat & Scarred,' but they should be cohesive. I hate to say it, but this song is basically just Metallica going through the motions. The drive is there and the effort shines through, but it's not paying off because they refuse to let go of the \"going back to the roots\" shit they've been yammering on about for the last decade. You're Metallica, one of the few bands that could bounce back from something like St. Anger - fucking act like it. They're holding themselves back, and once they shed this dishonest identity they've caped themselves in, their music will universally be considered holy again.\n",
        "\nSo, \"Atlas, Rise!\", in my opinion, is the lesser of the three tracks Metallica have yet released from their upcoming album \"Hardwired...to Self-Destruct\" due out on 18 November. But does that make it a bad track? No, I don't think so. This is actually fairly decent. So far, we have gotten the title track, \"Moth Into Flame\", and now \"Atlas, Rise!\". While the first two songs follow mainly a thrash metal style, what we get here is more reminiscent of the NWOBHM sound that developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This is interesting, because Metallica really hadn't made a song that sounds quite like this, and it definitely pays homage to one of their main influences: Iron Maiden.\n\nThe song opens up with a jagged riff that eventually turns into a thrash/speed metal riff similar to something they would have recorded for their \"No Life 'Til Leather\" demo way back in the day. I think the main issue I have with this song is how inconsistent it tends to sound. It goes from more of a thrash riff into a melodic NWOBHM riff in the chorus, which eventually features harmonizing guitars. This isn't necessarily bad. Although it seems to jump too quickly between these ideas. I will say the solos in this song, as there are two, are definitely better than the simple lead on \"Hardwired\" and are about on the same level as the one in \"Moth Into Flame\". There is another NWOBHM section after one of the solos that is absolutely melodic and freaking awesome, and it actually lasts for a decent length of time. \n\nDrumwise, there are none of the thrashy \"gallops\" that we have seen with the previous two songs. It's pretty much standard, more simple drumming, bearing more resemblance to the \"Metallica\" album from 1991 than anything. Seeing as Lars has actually used some impressive drumwork on the last two songs, surprisingly enough, this one kind of falls short. But it does fit with the music on this song. I guess that is the only thing that matters. \n\nReally, this song still manages to get me excited for the new album, which may or may not be the band's best release since \"...and Justice for All\". I was a fan of \"Death Magnetic\", but this so far is impressing me a bit more. My main issue, aside from the inconsistency of this song, is how the band has released three singles, and they are all only from the first disc. We still have no idea what anything from the second disc will sound like. Seeing as we have an idea of how the first disc will sound like, even if it's a bit diverse, I am really looking forward to hearing a glimpse of the second one, although it likely won't happen before the release of the entire album.\n",
        "\nEver since the day I stole this, I've never managed to really had a single listening experience that absolutely convinced me this is a great album. In fact, it wasn't until I took a look at the average review score on the Metal Archives that I even suspected it might be a great album - it just doesn't have that feeling of being a complete product that a really superb album should have. Maybe it has something to do with the sixth word of this review (pretty sure the shop has since closed down, so it should be safe by now) or the fact that everybody already knows about Metallica before you tell them, but the number one metal band on the planet have never sat comfortably with my listening tastes. Anyway, on with the review.\n\nRide the Lightning is better than Kill 'Em All. That much is true. It's also probably better than Master of Puppets and certainly wipes the floor with everything the band did after that. Yet Kill 'Em All is more fun and Master of Puppets is a little more enticing to explore, which leaves that tiny little electric chair sitting out in the cold, certainly as far as my collection goes. (It really is ridiculously small, isn't it? For years, I thought it was a lightning rod or something that you put on top of electricity pylons.) So, it isn't that fun and it isn't that interesting, but Ride the Lightning is still good. What makes it good? Quite simply, the songs are written really fucking well. There isn't anything else that you'd want to put into them and there isn't really anything that you'd like to take out. However, some of the songs are written so well that they lack a sense of excitement and danger. You know the absolutely awesome 'For Whom the Bell Tolls'? Well, it never changes pace and nothing ever happens to surprise me, unless you count the band basically playing a 3 minute song back to front to give it a bit more weight. How about 'Fade to Black', which meanders around one lame power chord filler riff for a minute and a half in the middle of the song, not to mention its earlier appearance, then the rock scale noodling that leads out of the song for an overwhelmingly pointless length of time.\n\nSome of the songs are genuinely well-written though. Despite some slightly dated moments, 'Ride the Lightning' is a beast of a song that does riffs like Donald Trump does publicity and packs a really nicely structured solo that makes use of Kirk Hammett's one good trick, which is blasting out of silence and melting into descending scales. For those unfamiliar with this trick, please refer to 3:43. 'Creeping Death' is also renowned for a reason and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' sounds good even if it isn't all that worthy in a creative sense. Problematically, that means I'm left saying that there isn't that much to write home about for 5 of the 8 cuts on the album, and I don't have to look further than 'Escape' to find some actual filler, especially as it seems that Billie Joe from Green Day was commissioned to write the chorus, while the rest of the song gives James Hetfield some unneeded practice at chugging on the low E. The only reason 'Trapped Under Ice' isn't also confined to the filler pile is that it has a somewhat decent energy and makes more of an effort with riffs. Oh, and just because 'Fight Fire With Fire' has some nice riffs doesn't mean it's not a totally boring song.\n\nThere are two things that I haven't mentioned yet that I really hate about this album, so if you're a true blue Metallica fan, it's time to look away or pull out your Internet connection or something similar. The first one is that stomping beat that Lars Ulrich seems able to put into almost every song here: it appears on all three of the songs I pulled out as good and - although it's cool when it crops up on 'Ride the Lightning' - the appeal quickly wanes as it's done over and over, always with the same odd contrast to the thrash dagger thrusts. If the guys were hoping for pussy that badly, they could have just fast-forwarded to Metallica (a.k.a. The Stadium Album) and forgotten about the rest. The second thing that I really, really hate is Kirk Hammett's fucking lead playing. Seriously, does no one else have this problem? He just plays the same rehashed solos again and again. Remember that one I pointed out in 'Ride the Lightning'? He plays it again at the start of 'Trapped Under Ice', practically note for note. Then there are so many other solos that follow the same pattern as each other or don't actually do anything during their length: again, I point you to 'Trapped Under Ice', this time to 2:55, and ask, 'Haven't you heard Hammett play that solo before?' On half the songs on this album and half the songs on Kill 'Em All too. Fuck you, Kirk Hammett.\n\nEnough of this pointless anger. The album is pretty good in its own right, what with a good guitar tone, some classic songs, and a wide-ranging influence, but I have to point out that it's also far from perfect and doesn't stand tall when compared to the best albums of many other thrash bands. I don't like it and there must be others like me. If the popular leanings of the Metal Archives need another angle to consider things from, I offer this - what would UltraBoris have said if he'd reviewed this?\n",
        "\nIt appears that of late, many of the 80s thrash bands have tried to come up with thrash- of the 80s flavour- interlaced with modern production. That is to say, thrash bands started writing actual thrash again. For example, Anthrax had come up with two good albums prior to For All Kings, which is also pretty solid. Dave and (whatever) co. had been trying to write thrash again since, ugh, Risk, from The World Needs A Hero to Endgame, culminating in their best work to date since their early 90s material- Dystopia. Heathen put out an outstanding album in 2010 and so did Forbidden with Omega Wave later on. But the finest example has to be Overkill with a barrage of three successive albums that just thrash right into metal's plane of existence starting with Ironbound and Testament's latest is scheduled to appear just around the corner and we're seriously hoping that songs will be of the Burnt Offerings/New Order calibre. We get the picture right? \n\nSo now the time has finally come for Metallica to thrash it all out again. Most of the bands that I've mentioned have some particular previous album that at least beckons to present us with a valid next course to take album-wise and we could refer to Overkill or Anthrax or even Megadeth (if 13 be omitted) as examples. \n\nMetallica, of course, have Lulu. And from Lulu(by), they suddenly plan to write thrash again. I'm not hating on the band for I love all their 80s output including the Black Album. But to listen to this particular track I simply had to look in retrospect at what the other aforementioned bands had been putting out recently. And so in comparison, this feels really forced. James isn't as pissed off as he sounds; for all of Lars's growl-ish expressions on the video, he still looks like the Lars of the last two decades; and Kirk... well his solo just doesn't sound right. This song has been made much too aggressive for its own good. \n\nNow to be honest I really wished this song came out good but it just doesn't. Average riffs which the band probably thought would be kicking us in the face meet the awful lyrics which the band obviously thought would actually rip through our senses. Newsflash- they don't and not if you put it the other way around either. It all just comes out as ' Don't you think we still got it?' kind of thing and it just falls flat. It would be borderline depressing if all songs on the album aspire to strike dull similarities to this one. It would be a complete shame if all this return-to-thrash attitude ended up in a perpetual whirlpool of recycled riffs propelled by tepid song writing coupled with zero inspiration. Most unfortunately, it will be a waste of time if Metallica doesn't have its heart in the right place- forging out an album just to shove it down our throats and say that they still had it. I don't get a genuine feeling out of this song, truth be told. \n\nI know its just one song from the album but I've still given it a low score because, you know, we'll see.\n",
        "\nMetallica famously titled this album after themselves. Does it live up to the hype?\n\nThis album is about characters, but also about the difficulties of being in a band. For instance, Sad But True examines being an emotional outlet of sorts for others, as in music, with lines like, \"I\u2019m your pain when you can\u2019t feel.\" The music is therefore also less intense, so that it can focus attention on characters and on itself. It does not rush ahead. Still, it remains thrash-influenced, and lines like that above can be highly perceptive observations in a thrash metal song.\n\nMetallica are less aggressive here, but their mainstream style should not deceive you. They still try to avoid overly sentimental themes when not writing ballads. Instead, songs like Enter Sandman still explore situations, but with detachment. This helps keep their metallic edge. While songs like Holier Than Thou are fluff, as thrash metal treatments of religion go, songs like Wherever I May Roam are quite good. It explores an interesting and ascetic situation where \"the earth becomes my bride,\" and \"she gives me all I need.\" It hence uses the language of hard rock, with its focus on sex and drugs as ways of satisfaction, and adapts this in a way critical of this. It is hence a unique song, and more responsive to other forms of music than most other Metallica songs.\n\nNothing Else Matters is a well-known ballad. It adds a highly judgemental metal tint to a traditional, laid back ballad. This is interesting, but quite partial. It is hanging out there with many vague proverb-like sentences, but doesn't really explore them. Despite its title, it does not seem that enthusiastic about committing to anything. It does show an attempt to meld metal riffs with a more laid-back song. They are both made harmonious.\n\nThis is the style of most of the album. The guitars are often quite minimal and set a tone. It's music that you could easily stop listening to if you get tired, or start listening to in other situations. They are trying to make music which can take a step back and give listeners room to breathe or react in a meaningful way. Still, this is not always well-received, due to its accessibility. Still, previous albums were already becoming accessible. This album is also an attempt at the kind of more involved music that can often confuse listeners. We must not treat it as accessible as if nothing else matters - it can also be complex and lonesome if listened to carefully, enough to turn many listeners elsewhere.\n",
        "\n\"St. Anger\". This album is universally known as THE worst metal album of all time. Well, not everyone believes that. Even I don't. But a lot of people do. \"St. Anger\" is often used as an analogy when citing a certain band's work as their worst album. For example, Morbid Angel's \"Illud Divinum Insanus\" and Cryptopsy's \"The Unspoken King\" come to mind, as these albums are usually referred to as \"the St. Anger\" of their respective bands, although I quite enjoy the latter as many people know. Kind of like how when a band \"sells out\", the respective album is usually called their \"Black Album\". Kind of funny how that works out. Anyway, \"St. Anger\"...fuck it all and no regrets.\n\nDuring the timeframe it took to record this album, Metallica was experiencing its fair share of personal and inter-band turmoil, as highlighted in the controversial \"Some Kind of Monster\" DVD documentary. Jason Newsted had left the band, leaving them without a bassist. James Hetfield had entered an alcohol treatment facility. Lars was still being a douchebag. The list goes on. Metallica had planned to begin recording this album in January 2001 but due to Newsted's understandable departure, the dudes had to put the project on hold. After the band recruited longtime producer Bob Rock to fill in on bass, the album's recording process began. We all know, as I said before, this was a time of great tension within the band. Everyone was dealing with a lot of crap and they had to hire a therapist to coach them through the process. \"St. Anger\" could have been a great album. It really could have been. Unfortunately, it suffered a lot due to these issues and of course, the production. \n\nThe guitars here have been tuned down a bit and actually, in my opinion, sound pretty cool. They are very thick and dirty. We haven't heard this raw of a sound from Metallica since the 1980s. Unfortunately, there were some huge issues with the production. In fact, these issues managed to bring my score of the album down so low, that I likely would have given it a score in the 70s otherwise. So, what's the biggest issue? The drums. Lars freaking Ulrich, man. This guy is definitely one of my least favorite people in music. It's not that he's not that great a drummer but rather his personality and how he managed to almost single handily screw this album completely over. The snare drum was turned off during the recording of this album and because of that, it almost sounds like Ulrich is using a trash can or a metal pot as a snare drum. It's a sound that occasionally gives me headaches and I'm not even exaggerating on that. \"Dirty Window\" is probably the biggest offender and I can hardly ever make it all the way through the song. The cymbals are also used a tad too much in my opinion, and the double bass parts sound fairly sloppy. I'm wondering if this was a one-take thing and Lars just said \"sounds good to me!\". That seems like something that would happen. There are drum lines that harken back to the band's thrash sound and I'm sure if the damn snare wasn't so offensive, these drum lines would have sounded far better. The drums almost manage to ruin the album but also, this album could have really benefited from more bass. That's the other issue I have production wise. It's not only boring and static to the guitars but it doesn't add anything to the dynamics of the music, which is what the job of the bass should be. \n\nGuitar wise, there are some pretty cool riffs. Unfortunately, this is another problem with the album. Yeah, we have cool riffs in tracks like \"Some Kind of Monster\", \"Invisible Kid\", \"The Unnamed Feeling\", and \"Sweet Amber\", but these riffs are played far too much throughout respective songs. It seems James and Kirk only wrote a few riffs for each song and just stuck with them because most songs operate on two to three riffs. Another common complaint is the lack of guitar solos. There is not one guitar solo on the album, nor is there anything that even resembles one, aside from maybe a few sub-par leads. I honestly wouldn't have minded Metallica's sololess approach as much if the songs weren't so damn long. \"Purify\" is the shortest song running at slightly over 5 minutes and \"All Within My Hands\" is the longest, which almosts reaches 9 minutes in length. This was a huge gamble that backfired. With most of the songs being over 7 minutes in length, you'd expect a band like Metallica to throw in a good amount of varying riffs and a few solos per song. This doesn't happen at all. Instead, like I previously mentioned, we get about two or three riffs per song, maybe a few more, and no guitar solos. Plenty of bands pull off repetition quite well in genres like doom or black metal but Metallica fits neither of these categories, and they shouldn't have gone through with this. I get the no solos thing. That would have been fine if the songs were condensed to maybe 6 minutes tops. As with the drums, there are even a few thrashy riffs thrown in here but mostly things are uninspired and messy.\n\nIn terms of vocals, this has to be Metallica's biggest failure as well. Hetfield sounds so far off key in every damn song. One of the worst examples would be \"All Within My Hands\". The whole \"KILL KILL KILL KILL\" thing sounds pretty damn laughable as it is but his voice sounds like absolute crap. \"Frantic\" has some strange moments (yeah, I'm referring to the \"frantic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tock\" thing) where he just sounds uncomfortable. And because of this, he's very uncomfortable to listen to. I think along with the drums, this has to be the album's most awkward aspect. \n\nI can't believe it took Metallica one whole year to record this. A year, for this? Even with all of the issues the band was going through, this is asinine. Sure, there are some cool moments here and there, but mostly, it's just a pain to sit through. This album could have been solid in my opinion but due to my documented reasons, it fails to. \"St. Anger' is Metallica's worst album and thankfully they reignited their spark with \"Death Magnetic\". I can't wait for \"Hardwired...to Self-Destruct\" to come out. For now, this is my last Metallica review. I will not be touching \"Garage Inc\" because, while it is a pretty cool album, it's a compilation of covers, and I don't really consider it to be a full-length album. Until next time!\n",
        "\nAbout a year and a half following the release of \"Load\", Metallica releases \"ReLoad\" in 1997. Basically, the boys had enough material to release a double album when they put \"Load\" out. So instead of doing that, which probably would have made more sense, they released the first half, then came back and released the remaining 13 tracks in the form of \"ReLoad\". This album is formulaically similar to \"Load\" in that it is more of a hard rock album than a metal one. The songs here sound a bit more unorthodox and strange than it's bigger brother. A lot of these songs just sound like throwaway ideas and that's why they weren't released in the first place. Don't get me wrong, like \"Load\", there are some pretty cool songs here. Unfortunately, you really have to sift through more filler than anything. \n\nThe guitars here sound a bit less crunchy than on the previous album. The production sounds a little different and maybe slightly more raw. \"Fuel\" is probably the most well-known song from the album and deals with fast cars. Yeah, that's not exactly a foreign concept to metal. Just ask Dave Mustaine. This song, however, doesn't get me pumped for the remainder of the album whatsoever. It's boring, uninspired, and so damn overplayed. \"The Memory Remains\" doesn't help the album either. That weird vocal thing that goes on just makes me feel confused and creeped out, and not in the cool, eerie way. More along the lines of a \"what the fuck is that shit\" kind of way. So, after the first two songs overstay their welcome, we finally get something pretty darn cool. \"Devil's Dance\" was one of the new songs that Metallica played live during \"Escape from the Studio '95\". This song is groovy and that opening bass line, while simplistic in structure, is really quite neat. This is what \"King Nothing\" wishes it could have been. I'm not going to go through each track, but I also have to point out a few more.\n\n\"The Unforgiven II\" is the second installment in the current trilogy of \"Unforgiven\". This is the weakest of the three. It has kind of a neat southern guitar chord that is played through the verses but the chorus is just bland and uninspired. It's basically the opposite of the first, and for that matter, the third songs. Harder chorus, softer verses. I tend to like the other songs far more because the choruses allow the song some time to breathe. Here, everything sounds forced and weird. Not a horrible track, but not really a good one either. We can also see that with the painfully boring \"Bad Seed\". Seriously, this song sounds like a straight up Pantera rip off. One of the worst from the entire album.\n\nThere are three songs, aside from \"Devil's Dance\", that sound fairly good. The first of which I want to discuss is \"Where the Wild Things Are\". It's a damn shame that Metallica never played this song live. It's a dark, twisted rock song that at times sounds a lot like Alice in Chains to my ears, and that's quite a good thing seeing as AIC is one of my favorite bands. It's quite trippy. Following this song is the next one I want to mention, \"Low Man's Lyric\". After the painfully average \"Prince Charming\", we finally arrive here. This almost sounds like \"Mama Said\" in that it's very much a western, almost country sounding song. Here, though, it's not awkward and is very haunting. It's the softest track on the album and the guitar melodies are simply gorgeous. The lyrics are also quite thought-provoking. It's a song that seems to discuss drug addiction, whereas the addict is looking at himself through his own two eyes realizing what a waste his life has become. It's very depressing, and I like it a lot. Finally, after yet another throwaway track with \"Attitude\", we come to the album's closing track \"Fixxxer\". It rivals \"Low Man's Lyric\" for the title of finest song. It's not as good as \"The Outlaw Torn\" from \"Load\", however, which seems to be the song's counterpart. It's the longest track here running at slightly over 8 minutes in length. It's the album's lengthy conclusion, similar to \"Outlaw\", but it sounds a bit lacking in comparison. The chorus is the best part and sounds really solid and melodic. The blues aspect is at is most prominent on this song. So, yes, we have about four songs that are pretty good here, but they don't even really sound as good as \"Load's\" best songs. \n\nUnfortunately, this album is mostly forgettable and contains far more filler than value. It's worse in comparison to the last album and far more boring. Metallica really should have just released \"Load\" as a double album and kept this on a second disc or something because it shouldn't take up a slot as an entirely separate album. Oh well, though. It's not the worst thing the band has done; that will be coming up in about 6 years. I will say James Hetfield's singing probably sounds slightly better on this album than on the last but it's really quite a close comparison and not too different. I heard there was speculation of Metallica returning to thrash metal after \"Metallica\" came out; I wonder how that would have panned out?\n",
        "\nMetallica was probably the busiest band to exist throughout the early 1990s. Not because of the material they were releasing in terms of quantity, but because of the lengthy tours supporting the band's breakthrough 1991 self-titled album. The band would tour from 1991 to 1994 in support of said album and in 1995, during the recording sessions for \"Load\" and \"ReLoad\", the band played a few shows for a very short tour called \"Escape from the Studio '95\". It nearly took a year to record these albums alone, not counting the extensive touring, which produced a five-year gap between \"Metallica\" and \"Load\". Along with the abhorred \"St. Anger\", the two \"Load\" albums are often considered the band's weakest efforts. Of course, \"St. Anger\" is the band's worst album in my opinion but these two are quite lackluster in a lot of areas. \n\nMetallica had created quite the divide in their fanbase with their previous album. Instead of following the band's thrash metal formula, they opted to shift towards a more radio-friendly heavy metal style with a stripped down, simplistic sound with shorter songs focusing on far fewer musical ideas. While this was a radical shift in style, the band still obviously played heavy metal. With 'Load\", we see the band straying further away from metal and into a more hard rock territory. The band played two new songs during their \"Escape from the Studio '95\" shows, \"2x4\" and \"Devil's Dance\". This gave the fans a taste of the band's new sound and I'm sure it alienated the band's thrash fanbase even more. With the release of this album, the band had totally abandoned any trace of their original sound and style, even sporting new haircuts. As if hair should have anything to do with musical style anyway. Regardless, \"Load\" is a very controversial release from Metallica. It has some really cool ideas here and there but pales in comparison to the band's 80's output, and also manages to fall short of the self-titled album.\n\nRight away, things begin to sound very different. The production of this album showcases very meaty, crunchy guitars that really focus mostly on simple riffs and grooves. It differs from the previous album because it's not as clean and polished, but it's also not dirty. This is an album that has definite traces of metal but it mainly qualifies as a bluesy hard rock one. \"Ain't My Bitch\" is one of the more \"aggressive\" songs here and it opens the album up. There is an obvious influence of southern rock here that is even more prominent on songs such as \"Ronnie\" and \"2x4\". The southern influences aren't exactly horrible but they come off as cheesy and frankly, I feel the opening track is a bad way to start the album. It has energy but lacks substance. \"Mama Said\" is probably the most controversial and experimental song on this album and perhaps over anything else Metallica has ever done. It is a combination of rock and country music with steel guitars and melodies that sound like it should have been released by Brad Paisley or something. I'll say if a country artist was to record something like this, it would be pretty decent. But Metallica? Nah, man. It sounds awkward and strange. It ties with \"Cure\" for my least favorite song on this release. \n\nAlong with the southern influence comes a huge incorporation of blues. \"Until It Sleeps\" and \"King Nothing\" are the album's two most well-known songs and actually sound somewhat decent during certain parts but I wouldn't say the songs hold their value throughout their respective durations. \"Bleeding Me\", on the other hand, is a song that sounds amazing. The entire thing holds my attention and I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of it. It's a slower one that opens with some bluesy clean guitars and quite mellow vocals from James Hetfield. When it picks up, it transforms into a solid hard rock song that makes it one of the two songs on this album that are actually really worth the time to listen. This song contains no filler and the solo, while not one of the best from Kirk, sounds great. It works well with the musical direction of the song. The other track that probably qualifies as my favorite here is the closing song \"The Outlaw Torn\". Running at nearly 10 minutes in length, it is among Metallica's longest. In fact, it would have been over 10 minutes if the CD's storage capacity would have allowed for it, and there is an uncut version of the song which continues the absolutely amazing jam toward the end. The riffs here are great and while simple, do the job. Solo wise, it's on board with \"Bleeding Me\". My favorite part of the song is the aforementioned section which contains one of the coolest riffs, and some bluesy guitar noodling. I really can't say anything negative about these two songs because they are powerful and full of heart. Sure, they don't beat out \"Justice\" or \"Sanitarium\", but that's not the goal here. \n\nI feel this album is slightly stronger than \"ReLoad\" although it's not by much. The simplistic drumming isn't worth talking about and really, there are only a few songs that really sound great. I can see why people would say this is the worst Metallica album but trust me, that ain't the case at all. The worst would come a few years later. This is just weird and somewhat boring stuff aside from a few gems. Mostly filler but some songs are killer.\n",
        "\n\"Master of Puppets\" is often considered the pinnacle of Metallica's career as a whole. I was released in 1986, along with other thrash classics such as \"Reign in Blood\", \"Peace Sells...but Who's Buying?\", \"Darkness Descends\", \"Pleasure to Kill\", \"Doomsday for the Deceiver\", \"Eternal Devastation\"...the list goes on and on, as this seemed to be the year of thrash for a lot of bands. This is Metallica's third album and, in my honest opinion, it is the weakest of the classic first four albums. But wait! A 93%? Absolutely! This album is still amazing, superb metal. It's just not quite on the level of the other albums released between 1983 and 1988. Hell, following up \"Ride the Lightning\" would have been a chore for any band to do!\n\nThis album seemed to build upon what \"Ride the Lightning\" had started. There are more clean guitar passages, acoustic guitars, and slower segments. \"Battery\" opens up with an acoustic Spanish guitar intro, played absolutely beautifully, before exploding into an aggressive thrash assault. This is one of the harshest songs on the album and plays a similar role, and musical idea, to \"Fight Fire with Fire\" from the band's previous album. The title track is up next and is arguably the most recognizable song on the album. Mixing galloping riffs, that beautiful, clean melodic middle section, and some impressive soloing, this song has become a fan favorite ever since its release 30 years ago. Most of the album, save for maybe the somewhat lacking \"Leper Messiah\" and the doom metal-esque \"The Thing That Should Not Be\", which also falls short of many of the other songs, rely on somewhat progressive song structures, which would be magnified a lot and perfected on the band's next album \"...and Justice for All\". It's really hard for me to choose one favorite song from this album so I often choose two as a tie: the ballad \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" and the anti-war thrash masterpiece that is \"Disposable Heroes\". The former features some of the most beautiful clean guitar segments Metallica has ever recorded, although once the first half of the song concludes, we go back into the standard thrash sound. The latter, however, gallops and crushes throughout its 8-minute duration. There are plenty of melodic riffs during solos but they still manage to keep the aggression. \n\nUnfortunately, due to his untimely death in that late 1986 bus accident, this would be bassist Cliff Burton's last hoorah. The bass on this album is thick and fat such was the case with the first two albums, and you can hear it well. \"Orion\", as many of us know, highlighted Cliff's unique style of bass playing. It's here that we can hear just what everyone means when they say Cliff truely played the bass like a regular guitar. It has that impact on the music. Alongside this beautiful instrumental, we get this album's brutal closer \"Damage, Inc.\". This song starts with a rather weird intro but once it explodes, you can visually picture Cliff's fingers engulfing in flames due to the song's pure speed. I never knew Cliff, as I wasn't born for 8 more years after this album, but he is one of the reasons I am aspiring to play bass, as clich\u00e9 as that may sound. This album was undoubtedly a testament to his genius and influence. \n\nIt's really hard to say anything about this album that hasn't already been spoken of. I'm simply reviewing it to complete my Metallica discography series. This album exists to kick your ass, but at the same time, showcase awesome melodic, non-traditional song structures and extreme aggression. It may be the \"weaker link\" of the band's first four iconic albums but it is still one everyone knows, and everyone should acknowledge as important and influential. This weird album only paved the way for the brilliance of \"...and Justice for All\" in terms of musical compositions but production wise, it's far better. A classic thrash metal masterpiece, this album is almost always deserving of any praise it gets.\n",
        "\nWell, I was focusing on Megadeth's discography (ironically) up until just now, but I figured I'd go ahead and tackle Metallica's first. Why? Because they have a new album coming out in two months. Of course, I am talking about the much anticipated \"Hardwired...to Self-Destruct\". November is going to be a massive month for Metallica. Judging by the last two tracks, they are expanding on what they did with \"Death Magnetic\"; returning to their thrash metal roots, although this time, their even closer to that sound. \"Kill 'Em All\" is often considered to be the first thrash album, although that can be debated. It's not the best Metallica managed to release thus far throughout their career but it's still absolutely furious, amazing metal. It's Metallica's most straight-forward thrash album and contains no ballads, no acoustic guitars, and some of the most frantic riffing the dudes would ever come up with, thanks to Mr. Mustaine. So let us discuss \"Kill 'Em All\": the most aggressive album from the world's biggest band. \n\nAround the time this album was released, glam metal was at an all-time high. It was considered cool to dress like a girl, fluff your hair to extreme volumes, and wear make up. Metallica took a stance completely against any of that. They increased the tempo, added darker lyrical content, and absolutely powerful vocals. They took the sonic sounds of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and mixed it with the speed of hardcore punk to create arguably the first proper thrash metal sound. Considering the band members were either 19 or 20 years old when this innovative album came out, it makes me think...what the hell am I doing with my life, just shy of 22?\n\nThe guitars on this album are, of course, the focal point. It is a well-known fact that Dave Mustaine, who was kicked from the band before this album's released and replaced by Kirk Hammett, wrote a lot of the riffs to this album. His contributions lie within the tracks \"The Four Horsemen\" (originally titled \"The Mechanix\"), \"Jump in the Fire\", \"Phantom Lord\", and \"Metal Militia\". His style is evident within these tracks, and you can tell on the other five songs (not counting the \"Anesthesia\" bass solo) that his riffing wasn't really there. He had this distinct way of writing speed riffs. On this album, however, he is not here, and Kirk takes his place. The guitar playing here is explosive and captivating. Most of the time, things are fast. Tracks like \"Whiplash\" and \"Hit the Lights\" keep things at a blazing pace while songs like \"The Four Horsemen\", \"No Remorse\", and the groovy thrasher \"Seek & Destroy\" have some more mid-paced sections. There isn't a lot of slow stuff here aside from melodic breaks like the solo in \"The Four Horsemen\" and the melodic passage of \"Phantom Lord\" but that's fine. At this point, these guys were just pissed off kids wanting to give the finger to the world, and they certainly achieved that. Guitar solos are absolutely everywhere but they don't overstay their welcome. \n\nOf course, we can't review a Metallica album without speaking of Lars Ulrich. Lars' drumming here isn't anything to jizz about but it's consistent and flows well with the rhythm of the music, which is what it's supposed to do in the first place. That's the idea behind drumming. His style is basic and at times fast, showing the punk influence in every song. I think he would showcase his skills a lot more on the next couple of albums but here, he does what he's supposed to do. \n\nSomething I really love about early Metallica is the bass. Yep, Cliff Burton was, for sure, a prodigy. I tend to adapt my style from Jason because I use a pick, but Cliff was the original (yeah, I know we had Ron on the demo and before Cliff, but I'm sorry, he wasn't the right dude) bassist and his playing is easily heard and well-showcased here. He was even allowed his own bass solo which is quite rare in heavy metal. \"(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth\" is the fifth track on this album, coming after \"Jump in the Fire\" and before \"Whiplash\". This song starts out as a melodic and technical bass solo but eventually becomes a mix of the bass solo and drums. It's the album's instrumental, and of the original four Metallica instrumentals, I think it's the weakest. That being said, this doesn't make the song bad. It's an amazing solo that shows just how good a bassist Cliff was. It's an oddity for sure. \n\nMixing melody, aggression, and screeching teen-angst ridden vocals from James Hetfield, \"Kill 'Em All\" just may arguably be the first thrash metal album. I say that because Venom released \"Welcome to Hell\" back in 1981, two years before this album. While it could certainly qualify as a proto-thrash metal album, to my ears, it is more of a speed metal one. There are thrash riffs but hell, thrash metal practically evolved out of speed metal, so this would make sense. I'm on the fence whether to cound this album as thrash's first but it is certainly an essential classic, and kicks your ass!\n",
        "\nMetallica is probably the only band which has more haters than fans. I can understand it: they made some great thrash metal albums back in the 80s, but then they changed radically. Some people say that they became mainstream and sold themselves to the major distribution companies, starting to make low quality commercial music. I still enjoy the Black Album (even if it\u2019s not thrash metal anymore), but I always avoided the following 3 albums (Garage Inc. doesn\u2019t count as a real album) like the plague.\n\nWhen Death Magnetic came out there was a general enthusiasm, people had great expectations. Some people said that it was a disappointment, some other said that it was their great return to thrash metal. The main \"problem\" with great bands is that they make great music and people expect they keep doing that. When this doesn\u2019t happen, there you have lots of haters. And this is what happens to Metallica when they make a new album since the Black Album was released. Many people don\u2019t really judge the music, they only criticize the fact that they\u2019re no more the old good Metallica. I think it\u2019s like a curse, but somehow they deserve it. If you take 8 years to make a new album (again, Lulu doesn\u2019t count) you\u2019d better do a good work.\n\nHardwired, which is both the first track and a single, tries to imitate their old sound and it fails. Not miserably, but it fails. It sounds like a weaker copy of their old songs. Riffs are similar to the ones in Battery, but the solo is short and quite simple. Considering how skilled Kirk Hammett is, it can be considered a waste of talent. Vocals are nothing special, as well as drums and bass. The production has nothing wrong, as you could expect from a professional band. It\u2019s not a bad song, it\u2019s just stale. The whole song sounds like something we already heard. Lyrics are, in my opinion, quite mediocre. The song is pretty short so nobody expects an epic poem, but only four stanzas composed of three or four lines are not much. Anyway, the length isn't the main problem because they have no deep meaning or message. And the refrain is just ludicrous: \"We're so fucked! Shit out of luck! Hardwired to self destruct!\"... Is this the best they can do? \n\nWhen a band like Metallica needs to copy from their old music it means that they seriously lack of creativity. I can understand why they did such a mess: they have been severely criticized because they left their old-school thrash metal sound, and now they\u2019re trying to make it back in order to give people what they want to hear, but they clearly have no more inspiration. That\u2019s really sad. Many years have passed since the 80s, and probably this is the best they can do now. If this is their best, they should stop making music, they\u2019re rich enough to enjoy their retirement. I know this is just a single and it's not enough to judge how their comeback will be, but after listening to this you can't really have good expectations.\n",
        "\nThrash metal is not complicated, and the quickest way to fail at it is to overthink things. While the jury may be out as to whether any full length album that occurred following ...And Justice For All could be considered thrash metal, Metallica has nonetheless spent the better part of 25 years overthinking things. This doesn't so much pertain to writing music that is too complex, since most of the greatest thrash albums of the early 90s were built off the idea of progressing and testing the time limits and riff counts of the style, but more so in how an album's sound is framed. This was perhaps best underscored in the melodramatic spectacle that was the Some Kind Of Monster video documentary, chronicling one of the worst exercises in fucking up studio production that culminated in St. Anger. Fame and Bob Rock went straight to Metallica's heads, and they were more concerned with trying to remain appealing to subsequent generations of numb-skull mainstream music consumers rather than do what they do best, namely crush skulls.\n\nAs with pretty much every promised return to form following the Load debacle(s), expectations have been extremely mixed regarding the nature of this band's upcoming 11th studio album (counting Garage Inc. and not counting Lulu). The tapping of studio engineer Greg Fidelman from the previous album Death Magnetic as a co-producer suggests another try at backpedaling from the commercial pandering of the 1990s and the abortion that immediately followed, with the results likely being mediocre. However, something must have clicked between Hetfield and Urlich because the upcoming album's single Hardwired actually delivers something not seen from this band since the 80s. Maybe it was these guys getting their asses handed to them in the quality department by low level tribute acts turned thrash revivalists like Evile and Tantara just a few too many times, let alone how superior much of Mustaine's output has been compared to Metallica's since 1992, or maybe James just decided to take up drinking again, but somehow this band just managed to turn back the clock something fierce.\n\nAs far as thrashers go, this song is extremely bare bones, and adopts the gradual riff progression style that the band showcased at a slower tempo on The Black Album (think songs like \"Of Wolf And Man\" and \"Through The Never\") and mashed it together with the high octane aggression normally reserved to full out thrashers from the 80s like \"Dyer's Eve\" and \"Battery\". The sense of build up and release is extremely well accomplished, all the while steering clear of atmospheric gimmicks or unnecessary diversions into mid-paced territory. Hetfield's vocals actually sound fierce again rather than gelded, most likely due to Fidelman convincing him to give up on his quest to become a country and western star. Lars' drumming is also surprisingly well-produced, to the point of sounding all but exactly like the 1986 studio version of himself that managed to shut up all the detractors digging at him for not making the cut in Metal Church. The only slouch to be found in this otherwise solid thrashing machine in Hammett's guitar solo, which is mercifully free of wah noise (there may be plenty of it to be heard on the final LP) but kind of anti-climatic and more of a space filler. A song like this calls for something on par with what he brought to ...And Justice For All, yet what occurs almost sounds like a reject from one of the Load albums.\n\nIt might be jumping the gun a bit, but this is the first time in about 20 years that I've found myself fairly optimistic about how things will turn out here. There is always the looming threat of this being an even more impressive rehash of a misleading lead off single \"My Apocalypse\", which imbued a degree of false hope for Death Magnetic, even with the horrendous drum production and Hetfield's voice being similarly flatly produced and sloppy. But all things considered and not withstanding the extremely lame album art, this could prove to be what all of these depressingly nostalgic old school Metallica fans were hoping to get. As long as the alcohol keeps flowing the Hetfield's vocal chords and as long as Urlich is content with being a drummer rather than a pencilpusher with his own office desk, all may yet become right with the world again.\n",
        "\nEver since the so-called \"Black\" album, Metallica reminds me of my favorite football team. Every season I get excited and optimistic that this could be the one only to end up disappointed and dejected. Metallica's new song, Hardwired, is no exception. I started listening to these guys when I was 14 back in 1985. A buddy of mine threw in Anesthesia from Kill 'Em All for me and I was blown away. The band's posters and magazine photos took over every inch of my walls, and Kirk Hammett inspired me to pick up the guitar. This band was special. What made Metallica special to me was James's vocals, memorable riffs/melodies, unpredictable song direction, and Kirk's signature simple, yet artfully written, solos....all of which has been missing in Hardwired.\n\nHardwired appears to attempt to take us back to the early days of Metallica, but falls short of that goal. The song started well enough, but what I wanted to get to right away was the vocals. Ironically, the guy who never felt comfortable being a vocalist has embraced it to a fault. He replaced full, raw, and rough around the edges vocals with sharp, hollow, and crisp ones in Death Magnetic, which appears to continue into Hardwired. All one has to do is put in a live version of Four Horseman '89 then listen to James in 2016 attempting to sing this song. He can't really believe this new style is better. Then we come to Kirk's solo; I really thought he was going to nail it when I could not hear a wah pedal, then it was over without warning and what sounded like it was cut off in the middle. \n\nThe song is short, which is okay, but it does not do much with the time given. Much unlike vintage Metallica, if you listen to the first 30 seconds of the song you heard the entire song, for the most part. There are no memorable riffs, no \"meat\" to the song. It just doesn't take you anywhere. If this is the best they could put forward to show off the new album I am preparing myself for disappointed yet again.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the failed abortion that is known as \"Lulu,\" I had lost all hope for Metallica. Never had I ever heard such a disgustingly bad album, so basic and so pointless that it made St. Anger sound like gold. I thought to myself: there's no way they could ever come back from this, the mighty gods have fallen. That is until I heard \"Hardwired.\" I'm not kidding, this is probably the first bit of actual good content that Metallica have released in what seems like forever. Metallica, a band that will be revered for years to come as one of the, if not the most, biggest metal bands of all time, finally came to their senses and actually made something worth listening.\n\nThe song was fast, heavy and it even reminded me of the early Metallica, to some degree. It actually sounded like thrash! This is a massive improvement, as most of you have heard the atrocities they have released prior to this little tidbit of good news. This song actually made me smile and bob my head a little bit, I honestly thought I was dreaming. This couldn't possibly be Metallica, it seemed almost too good to be true. James Hetfield actually sounded good for a change and the riffs were enjoyable to listen to because they actually had structure this time. I have to admit, even the drums dazzled me a little, there's no way Lars did them but I digress. As much as I hate Kirk Hammet's wah pedal addiction, the solo midway through the track was actually fun and complimented the rest of the song rather well. The whole song was short, which isn't Metallica's style normally, but it was refreshing to see that they've decided to shake it up a little. I think they've finally learned from their mistakes, at least as far as we know.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the album isn't released yet so anything can still happen. Metallica might disappoint us yet again with another tragic error. One thing is for sure though, this has sparked a little bit of hope in me, a guy who used to be a huge fan. This is a good sign for Metallica moving forward and this song actually has me curious about how the rest of the album will turn out. My finger's are crossed for them, this could make or break them as a band. Should the album do well, Metallica will resurrect and fix what they have broken. If they fail, their glory days are meant to be buried and to stay that way.\n",
        "\nI was trying to come up with a word that would adequately describe my feelings towards this song. I knew it was there, but it kept eluding me. Finally, I got it: \u2018stock\u2019. Stock riffing, stock imagery, stock attitude, stock lyrics. Seriously, if ever there was a Metal Song Generator\u2122, once you included \u2018thrash\u2019 as a prerequisite, it would spew out something like this.\n\nWhat I have just described also prevents the song from being really bad. It\u2019s too competent to actually suck, it\u2019s played well enough (even Lars is doing a relatively decent job here), the production is their most adequate since \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d \u2013 it has an air of a well-performed job. Which is all great, but unfortunately, the song has absolutely nothing else going for it.\n\nMy problem with Metallica since \u201cSt. Anger\u201d is this: they seem to have lost a huge part of their musical sensitivity. What all the albums up to and including \u201cReload\u201d had for them was the current of emotion and beauty underneath whatever the main genre was at a given point (thrash, mainstream metal, even country). Whether I listen to \u201cTo Live Is to Die\u201d, \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d, or \u201cMama Said\u201d, I feel I can connect with the songs, I may like them to a lesser or greater extent, but there is a certain \u2018roundness\u2019 to them, they strike me as fully realized ideas.\n\nFast forward to the 21st century and Metallica have forgotten what the basic ingredients of a good piece of music are. Both the band and the fans have become obsessed with \u2018returning to their roots\u2019, \u2018thrash\u2019, \u2018playing hard again\u2019 and other secondary issues, forgetting that this is all meaningless without well-written songs. And herein lies the problem: Metallica don\u2019t seem to remember how to write songs anymore. Their riffs tend to incorporate unpleasant notes that wear the compositions down and turn the melodies into unmemorable and tired mess. These notes are often misplaced disharmonic blues-based accents that sound terribly awkward. Dissonant and misplaced notes are not uncommon in thrash but Metallica cannot use the technique to their advantage. All this is of course true for \u201cHardwired\u201d.\n\nThen there are the structures and the drumming. The riffs are strung together haphazardly, there are no coherent bridges and those that do appesr are marred by uninspired performances from Lars (seriously, how many times can you play the same tired Lars-beat and the same uninteresting snare rolls?) Still, the problem is not that he is a bad drummer, the problem is that he has an array of stock beats he relies on, not trying to vary things AT ALL. (Name another metal drummer who is cheered each time he manages to use the double bass. Seriously, why are the standards set so low for his performances? On \u201cJustice\u201d he showed that he does have some (limited) chops. He is also not that old, so why is everyone resigned to his lacklustre performances?). \u201cHardwired\u201d itself manages to fool the listener that its structure is tight, but this is only because of its short length, it\u2019s no better than \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d in this respect. Seriously, listen to Lars\u2019 drum rolls, it\u2019s just stupid.\n\nThen there is the problem of the second guitar. I don\u2019t like most of Kirk\u2019s solos and I think he is vastly overrated but that\u2019s a minor point. The main issue I have with Metallica\u2019s guitar arrangements is that they almost completely waste the opportunity to vary things harmonically. There riffs never reveal hidden melodic/harmonic layers \u2013 to my ears they sound like simple more or less random workouts. \u201cHardwired\u201d is the perfect example of palm-muted choppiness with no atmosphere. The same goes for the bass, it\u2019s been criminally underused since 1987 (\"Garage\") and the Hetfield/Urlich duo jest cannot carry the weight of the arrangements by themselves. Kirk\u2019s only input in \u201cHardwired\u201d is a perfunctory solo that trails off pointlessly. Now, if you are relegated to the role of a soloist in a band, try at least to make some effort to justify your relevance. Playing half-hearted solos and doing nothing else is just useless.\n\nAnother issue are the lyrics. I have absolutely no idea why they resort to stock phrases (incl. the obligatory fuck and shit) and string them seemingly at random to sound faux-aggressive. I understand that with age they may have abandoned the sentiments expressed on, say, \u201cJustice\u201d, not to mention \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d, but come on! These are men who have experienced more than the whole population of an average-sized town! Can\u2019t they channel these experiences into an interesting and coherent form? Is \u201cshit outta luck\u201d all they are capable of? My point is not that the lyrics are \u2018bad\u2019. As with Lars\u2019 drumming, it\u2019s beside the point, many bands turn this kind of conscious dumbing down to their advantage; what actually matters is that they are ridiculously clich\u00e9 and I see absolutely no reason why they need to be so. The same goes for the atrocious artwork.\n\nAll in all, \u201cHardwired\u201d (and the band) is completely removed from what metal is nowadays. Their rehashed thrash sounds completely inoffensive and tame by today\u2019s standards. I understand why hungry fans swallow this up, but if you put it into perspective, musically speaking, this is a one big nothing and were it not for the band\u2019s name, the song would be lost among all the brilliant metal music recorded nowadays, in various sub-genres. I wish the band would stop thinking in terms of genres and expectations and try to sit and write good songs instead. Concentrate on good melodies, harmonies, un-obvious (if not innovative) arrangements, and spontaneity. Live up to what you so often preach (\u2018we do whatever we want\u2019), instead of doing the exact opposite.\n",
        "\nLike numerous other thrash trailblazers who hit their peaks in the 80s, Metallica, it would seem, has decided to return to the violent storm of thrash they themselves had a hand in creating. Slayer and Overkill, among others, have been releasing thrash albums again for a while, though with modern production techniques and musicians now in their 50s, they just aren\u2019t quite able to reignite the fires that once fueled them. With Metallica\u2019s latest single, hopefully a representative sample of what\u2019s on their upcoming album, the most successful metal band in the world finds itself in the same boat. \n\nApproaching this song with the proper amount of trepidation for a new Metallica number, I found almost right away that the band was actually delivering competent thrash for the first time since \u2018My Apocalypse\u2019. \u2018Hardwired\u2019 delivers a strong, bombastic opening, meaty riffs, fast tempos, surprisingly solid drumming from Lars, gruff, convincingly angry vocals from Hetfield that sound great, considering his age, some good verses, and a chorus that's simple, effective, and a bit silly. With a spotless production bringing everything together, 'Hardwired' emerges as a strong single that bounces energetically along. It doesn't quite recapture the spirit of vintage 'tallica but this tribute to their older style is certainly much better than almost anything else they've released since 1988. \n\nDespite the quality of its individual parts, this song, clocking in at just over 3 minutes, feels incomplete, like it might be a shortened version of itself. 'Hardwired' gets straight to the point and doesn't seem to have been developed as much as it should have been but it's a nice little song that doesn't overstay its welcome. \n\nAnyone who wants a carbon copy of what made Metallica so great in the early 80s is, as the lyrics in this song\u2019s chorus go, shit out of luck. James and Lars will never be as passionate and eager to prove themselves as they were when Kill \u2018Em All was still new. As a result, this song has a bit of an artificial feel. They seem to be doing their best to replicate their younger selves and as long as that means invigorating riffs, solid songcraft, and energetic execution, and it does here, this reviewer is satisfied, even if we'll never get Kill 'Em All: Part II.\n",
        "\nMetallica, the band that needs no introduction, returns eight years after their last full length collection of recycled riffs and tired song structures to bring us another rehash of an old song as a preview to what will probably be another collection of recycled riffs and tired song structures (this time almost as long as The Book of Souls).\n\nIf anyone still doesn't believe that this band gave up being creative a long time ago, just play this track for them. In the tradition of the blatant One remake The Day That Never Comes comes Hardwired, a song that sounds like a mutant rape baby of Motorbreath and Battery recorded during the Death Magnetic sessions.\n\nDon't get me wrong; there are a few things I like about this song. Some have criticized the lyrics for being juvenile, but I think the angry way James delivers them makes them fit in with the ferocity of the rest of the track (and his annoying Oohs and Ahs are nowhere to be found). Kirk's solo is short but sweet and doesn't abuse the dreaded pedal. The bass is quiet, but if you listen closely you can tell it's there. Lars' drumming is very simplistic and repetitive, but the song isn't long enough for it to get irritating. The band puts in a good performance, but Hardwired is just so similar to their past works that it feels lazy and not genuine. Why bother making new music at all if you're not even going to try to do something original? I guess the fans' reception of Lulu must have scared Metallica from ever trying anything new again. It reminds me of Black Sabbath's 13 in that it sounds like a tribute band creating new material that sounds exactly like the back catalog of the band they worship, and then the actual band they worship decides to rerecord it. \n\nI suppose it's not fair to be too harsh. At this point in their career we can't really expect them to experiment again because they have no reason to. We already know the new album will sell tens of millions of copies regardless of the quality. the band will drag their wrinkly asses out on a two year tour, and metalheads everywhere will continue listening to the old stuff while posting inflammatory comments online about Kirk's wah and Lars' cymbals. It just that it's painful to see this once great band become a geriatric dinosaur.\n\nIn short, it's not as bad as St. Anger, but that's no real consolation. My expectations are set low for the new album.\n",
        "\nMetallica, of course, does not need any kind of introduction and with that out of the way, let's delve straight into the surprise appearance of the band's new single, taken from their forthcoming album Hardwired...to Self-Destruct.\n\nOnce upon a time, Metallica were gods and my room was, for all purposes, a dedicated altar. There I worshipped and loved the unique blend of melodic heavy metal and pounding thrash metal, there I mourned the loss of Cliff Burton, there I cluttered the walls with Metallica posters. I'm saying this so you know where I'm coming from when trying to give an honest review of \"Hardwired\" (what I'm really trying to say is that I haven't really liked much of what Metallica has been doing since 1988, but that I loved them so hard back in the day that I still get pretty hyped when they are back in the limelight). \n\nEight years have passed since Death Magnetic, and from the massive amount of online discussions I can only assume the world wants to hear more Metallica; everybody is interested, it seems, and the general opinion seems to be that \"Hardwired\" is the best song the band has done since their glory days; I've seen claims that this song goes straight back to Kill 'Em All. I beg to differ.\n\n\"Hardwired\" is, from beginning to end, an entirely mediocre piece of thrash metal where nothing really stands out beyond James Hetfield sounding really good for his age and that, for once, the production is bearable. \n\nPersonally I find it hard to hear any Kill 'Em All in this material, maybe people feel that way because \"Hardwired\" is a relatively fast and aggressive piece. No, this new track is much, much closer to Death Magnetic in style, just not as bloated and overly long. The main riff is just memorable enough to remind you it's very similar to \"This Was Just Your Life\"; there's a slight hint of \"Enter Sandman\" in here as well, but overall \"Hardwired\" sounds like it could come straight off Death Magnetic. You can't avoid some repetition, of course, I just kinda wish the band used their earlier albums as a template instead (although I guess they did try that on songs like \"The Day That Never Comes\" and \"Suicide & Redemption\", and it turned out feeling wrong anyway - damned if you do, damned if you don't).\n\nRight, then there's the chorus, which despite being incredibly short, is the best part of the song; James Hetfield sounds convincing, I love that he's gone back to snarling a bit, I will always love the sound of his voice I guess (when he's not singing country rock, at any rate), and despite the banal lyrics I can imagine this chorus going over rather well in a live setting. We'll all be shouting that we're fucked and shit out of luck. The lyrics to the verses are slightly better - it's similar to the vision presented so horrifyingly in \"Blackened\", but thoroughly simplified, termination being a key word. The simple three-chord riff backing up James' words reminds me of Slayer, but works well enough. \n\nThere's a solo by Hammett thrown into the mix as well, though it hasn't really registered with me; it's kind of just there, and that's the overall problem I have with \"Hardwired\". The entire track is just...there. The riffs, the rumbling, it never really grabs me. It sounds bland and, if you ask me, could have used a melodic break for contrast (but then I'm the guy who prefers \"Orion\" over \"Metal Militia\"). Not as dreary as listening to the dryer, \"Hardwired\" just doesn't feel like it is going anywhere; there's little to pay attention to.\n\nDespite all this, I do feel that Metallica may just be on the road of recovery after all, because there are some good hints here; better production, better vocals, more audible bass (if barely), Kirk sounds like he's willing to make his solos a little more interesting again, and hell even Lars manages to overcome himself, sounding thrashier. It remains to be seen what the rest of the album will be like, and this single and the surging Metallihype certainly make me curious if not overly excited. \n\nIf you enjoy Metallica without the \"classic\" frills (interesting bass lines, lush guitar harmonies, acoustic parts, progressive elements), you can probably add another 20% or so to the score, what do I know, I'm an old fart who can't let go of the eighties.\n",
        "\nLet me say first that my excitement when Metallica announced a new single and album was matched only by my fear of what it could be. A million terrified thoughts fizzed around in my head saying things like \"St. Anger 2\", \"Lulu: The Sequel\", \"Un4given\" and \"Re-reload\". So perhaps my score may even be inflated by the fact that it is thrash, a welcoming relief. However, the issue we do have to contend with is the quality of said thrash.\n\nThe song on display here is worse than Death Magnetic; it's probably the worst thrashy thing they've released. The band vomits up riffs they've used before, with shades of \"Battery\" and a thousand other insipid pieces in the genre, while \"Papa Het\" (yup, he's still clinging to the southern rock image just 'cos of \"Mama Said\", I don't know why either.) spits token obscene lyrics, but I will say I like the \"We're so fucked/Shit outta luck/Hardwired to self-destruct\" chorus, something which few others seem to. On a more positive note, Lars sounds better than ever, showing *gasp* technical drumming with a nice mix of the traditional \"Ulrich beat\" and a nice chunk of double-kick action (side note: I listened to Death Magnetic recently, and there is double-kick on there, but this is better) and Kirk's solo is okay I suppose, again though it isn't as good as their 2008 effort. \n\nIn terms of what I broadly categorize as \"other stuff\", i.e. what is secondary to the music, this is also a success(ish). Thankfully, the brickwalled-as-fuck Rubin production is gone, replaced by a now loud and rather good job by Greg Fidelman. Further thankfully, Ulrich's Saint Anger- era kit has been put in a closet somewhere, hopefully never to be seen by humanity again. Less thankfully, the artwork is an eyesore. Now this really is the nadir in terms of the band's artwork, it's a nightmarish photoshop job which even fucked with the classic logo. And the image on this thing? Well, Papa Het becomes Demon Het by the look of it. Seriously, jeez just put it in plain black, be simplistic, I mean, that worked for the Black Album, and you guys' pensions owe a lot to that.\n\nOverall pond'rances, then. Well, it's better than Slayer's recent output, and it's better than 'Tallica's too, so I'm feeling a degree of excitement for the new album, and although it may not be as good as their ninth, it seems a lot better than the \"Oh! My ears! They bleed!\" reaction I (and most people) had to Saint Anger. So yeah, we can afford ourselves some small hype I feel, and remember kids: Thrash doesn't need originality to be enjoyable(ish). I think this song embodies that perfectly.\n",
        "\nMy expectations for this one were rather low, considering how bad Metallica has been for the last two decades, as well as the claim from the band that it will be \"more diverse\". But after these three minutes were over, my expectations had been raised. This is the thrashiest song that they have done since 1988. It's full of energy, it's heavy and it's straightforward. The lyrics are pretty standard for Metallica. The chorus lines are practically laughable, but that's what makes this song so fun. It has one hell of a main riff, as well as some other really good ones. It pretty much sounds like something straight from \"Kill 'Em All\", or \"Ride The Lightning\".\n\nThe production is actually good this time. Nothing sounds colicky and it throttles your brain. The drums aren't unbearably loud in the mix. They still have a lot of volume, but this time it's used to run with the music, rather than overpower it. The solo is pretty cool, has a bluesy tone, though I wish that it was just a little longer. That's really my only problem with this song. That as well as a slightly more independent bass, though the latter doesn't really harm the music. I just feel it would have made it a tad better.\n\nThis is a great thrash metal song, even though it slightly underestimated its own potential. It doesn't waste any time with a crappy intro or a boring instrumental. There will likely be longer songs on the album, as Metallica's compositions tend to be great in length, so there will probably be songs that are fully aware of themselves. But still, this was one hell of a teaser of an album that could be surprise of the year. Either that or they will do what Hammerfall did with the song \"Hector's Hymn\", witch was the only good song on its album. But the odds have most definitely been raised into favor of the affirmative. I am definitely excited for the album.\n",
        "\nWhen \"Death Magnetic\" came out, which I consider a return to Metallica's thrash roots, it was met with polarizing opinions. There was a lot of positivity but also, a lot of people were unhappy with it. Whether it be \"not thrash enough\" or the iffy production, most everyone had something to say. I'm sure it will be no different with this song or the album once it comes out, as hating Metallica is the \"cool\" thing to do. The bottom line is this: \"Hardwired\", the first single from Metallica's upcoming tenth full-length album, is pure thrash metal. \n\nMusically this sounds like it could be a \"Damage, Inc.\" Part II. It is quite fast and aggressive. There are some issues with this track that do detract from it a bit. The snare roll at the beginning is a bit annoying (yeah, thanks, Lars) and the lyrics are a bit ridiculous. \"We're so fucked! Shit outta luck!\". It sounds juvenile and teen angsty. James' vocals are similar to they were on the last album. The production here is also a bit better and not as static as it was on \"Death Magnetic\" but still retains that very loud, over-the-top sound. It's slightly better but those drums are too loud and the bass isn't loud enough. Thankfully, it makes up for this in terms of aggression, riffs, and a fairly decent solo from Kirk.\n\nSo yes, this is definitely a thrash song. Yes, it's flawed. But that's okay. This is still Metallica stepping into the right direction again.\n",
        "\nIt is well-known in the world of music that Metallica was going through a lot of turmoil and emotional pain during the making of their fourth full-length album \"...And Justice For All\" from 1988. Longtime bassist and good friend Cliff Burton had died in a tragic bus accident back in the fall of 1986 and was replaced by Jason Newsted of Flotsam and Jetsam fame only one month later. Jason proved to be an amazing bass player and a worthy replacement for the legend himself. Unfortunately, Metallica grieved a lot about Cliff through Jason. This resulted in widely-known, heavy hazing from the other three band members. This would even affect the production of this album but I will get into that later. Even though this album has one big flaw, it is just so musically perfect and intricate that really, you don't need the bass!\n\nThe album opens with one of the band's most well-known songs, \"Blackened\". After the beautiful intro, this song takes a complete 180 into an absolute beast. This is one of the album's thrashiest songs. Musically, this is still a thrash metal album, but borrows a lot from progressive metal, giving it the deserved label of \"progressive thrash metal\". This song has some of the faster riffs AJFA has to offer and one of the coolest solos as well. Is it the album's best track, however? No, not by a bit. The title track is next and, just barely, in my opinion, is the album's best cut. It's far less of a thrash metal song and more of a progressive one. After the clean intro, we are introduced to some proggy riffs and melodic segments. The solo manages to top \"Blackened\" as well. The guitars are obviously the focal point of this album, as usual, but with the lack of any and all bass, they're even more prominent. Honestly, as an aspiring bass player, it does upset me slightly James and Lars (seriously, fuck Lars) decided to mute the instrument. It's just so good otherwise, I decide to look the other way in this rare case. This is the album's second longest song, about 15 seconds shy of 10 minutes. Thankfully, a lot happens and we don't get tired of it. Well, I don't, anyway. \n\nThis album is mainly so popular among Metallica fans due to the track \"One\". A song that got its own music video, and deals with the tragic theme of a soldier that stepped on a landmine and lost his eyes, arms, legs, ears, and mouth, but remained alive, \"One\" is truly a moving song. The verses are melodic, led by clean guitar passages. The chorus is a bit harder but the heavy moment doesn't happen until the machine gun riff/double bass drum pattern comes in. Aside from this, what we have here again is more progressive than thrash. There are songs that really blend prog and thrash about half and half quite well, like \"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\" and \"Harvester of Sorrow\". Aside from \"Blackened\", the other two songs that are nearly pure thrash would be \"The Shortest Straw\" and the absolutely frantic \"Dyers Eve\". In terms of length, these songs range from a bit over 5 minutes, the shortest being \"Dyers Eve\", and about 10 seconds shy of 10 minutes, being the instrumental \"To Live Is to Die\". This instrumental passage can be seen as Cliff's final moment of musical creativity, as he was involved with this song's writing progress. This almost matches the title track in terms of musical perfection, with its absolutely gorgeous riffs and interesting tempo changes. The melody that begins about 4 and a half minutes into the song, and 30 seconds later turns into a magnificent clean riff, is one of the best things Metallica has ever written. There are even what sounds like some synth-strings thrown in here, and wow, that solo!\n\nJames, in my opinion, offered his best vocal performance ever on this album. His voice sounded more mature on this release than on the previous three, dropping a bit of the adolescent rage, yet still sounding quite aggressive in comparison to the style he would adopt on the album following this one. I've always liked his performance on here the best. Plus, given the emotional turmoil he must have been feeling, this makes the sound of his vocals only that much more justifiable. I recently heard a demo of \"Holier than Thou\" from the band's 1991 album that would come out after this, and he was still using this AJFA-era style of vocals. I often wish he would have stuck with this style but in a way, I guess it wouldn't fit the band's 1990s heavy/groove metal/rock style. \n\nSo, as I mentioned at the beginning, this album completely omits the bass. Absolutely fucking omits it. I really wish they would have let Jason be heard here because he really was the band's second best bassist, and really, was very close to Cliff stylistically. Well, aside from using the pick instead of fingers. But, I digress. Apparently, the bass tracks followed too closely to the riff patterns produced by Hetfield and Hammett, and this would create some type of \"musical war\", resulting in the instruments fighting to be heard. Lars also wanted his drums to be louder, so, there's that. Really, this is one of the best performances from Lars, but come on, you did not need to sacrifice the bass, especially because the drums actually suffered from being this loud. That \"click\" sound can be a bit too much at times. Also, as we all know, this was just another way the band hazed Jason. It's no wonder that he left but I'm shocked he managed to put up with the band's shit until 2001. 15 years! Thankfully, as I said, this doesn't manage to degrade the sheer musical brilliance of the album. Seriously, though, fuck Lars.\n\nSo, with really the negation of the bass and the volume of the drums being my only real gripe about this album, it manages to be musically perfect to my ears. Only barely beating out \"Ride the Lightning\", it manages to be my favorite Metallica album. Truly a testament to thrash metal and the way music as a whole can be created.\n",
        "\nMetallica's self-titled record (or, \"The Black Album\") sure is an interesting one; it's the best-selling album from one of the best-selling bands of all time (as well as the best-selling record of the entire \"Soundscan era\", period), and it helped pave the way for a ton of the old-school thrashers to switch to a more downtempo, \u201chalf thrash\u201d sound, but it still remains a highly divisive record despite all this... or maybe, because of it? At any rate, considering the fact that it just celebrated the big anniversary of a quarter-century since its release, I figured it could do with my own unique take on it, and just why opinions are so split on it. First off, the legacy of the great ...And Justice For All had a major effect on the direction Metallica went on TBA: due to the greater lengths and structural complexity of the songs on Justice, they were a bit of a pain in the ass to duplicate live, so the band was determined to streamline things down for their follow-up. Factor in radio-friendly producer Bob Rock entering the picture, and it\u2019s no surprise when you hear how glossy the production is on TBA, along with how simplified and relatively commercial the songwriting is.\n\nHowever, while you can reasonably argue that it sounds like a bit of a \"sell-out record\" at the very least, I still can\u2019t fault how basically good the album sounds, or how catchy some of the songs are; there should be no argument that the intro on opener \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d is timeless, with that eerie, echoing guitar line, followed by Jason\u2019s bubbling bass and tentative jabs of Hetfield\u2019s rhythm guitar, until things blow up into\u2026 dumbed-down, MTV-friendly riffing that never really threatens?? Unfortunately yes, which is the big paradox for me with The Black Album; it is generally well-executed, and isn\u2019t (as I see it) an objectively-bad clusterfuck like St. Anger, but what the band is creating here just isn\u2019t very challenging in general. It\u2019s like they set out to make an album of medium-length, ready-for-radio singles, and indeed, half the songs here did end up becoming singles. For example, in \u201cSandman\u201d, you hear a pretty predictable progression from verse to chorus and then back again, with a big solo and breakdown that also fail to surprise, and most of the rest of the album basically sticks to that level of safeness. The tempos are often too easy-going, and while the riffs are catchy, they still aren\u2019t aggressive enough, which is a shame, considering how TBA really does have a nice, strong rhythm guitar sound, and I would\u2019ve loved to hear Metallica use it for some heavier, more ambitious songs, instead of what we ended up with.\n\nAnyway, after \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d, even if the album doesn\u2019t really challenge you, it still entertains decently with catchy cuts like \u201cSad But True\u201d, \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d, and \u201cHolier Than Thou\u201d, while \u201cOf Wolf And Man\u201d and \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d give us a temporary picture of the heavier direction I would\u2019ve preferred seeing here, and finally, the metal ballad (not power ballad) \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d hearkens back to the legitimate emotion of something like \u201cFade To Black\u201d with its outpour of tender, genuine feeling. However, even after accepting TBA on its own commercialized terms, there still remain some duds; \u201cMy Friend Of Misery\u201d has this sad, pathetic Droopy Dog-feel to it, \u201cThrough The Never\u201d is a half-hearted attempt at thrashier riffing, and while I do think the sentiment behind \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d was (probably) genuine, the actual end product still feels like a pussy power ballad on the same level of something like \u201cEvery Rose Has Its Thorn\u201d. Finally, \u201cDon\u2019t Tread On Me\u201d is a fucking embarrassing, jingoistic attempt at creating some sort of patriotic \"national anthem\" style song, and is one of my least-favorite Metallica songs from before the 2000's.\n\nFortunately, besides those misfires, even though TBA won\u2019t kick your ass in general, it\u2019s still pretty decent fun. I can easily sympathize with its haters, and I don\u2019t listen to it anywhere as much as I do Lighting, Puppets, or Justice, but I still feel it\u2019s been trashed a bit too much ever since every single metalhead\u2019s girlfriend went out and bought it after seeing the \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d video playing on TV. Manage to accept it on its own terms, and you just may enjoy it. And even if you don\u2019t, I won\u2019t hold it against you.\n",
        "\nIt's hard to write a long review for one single song, even if it does eclipse 8 minutes in length. So, I'm going to provide a fairly short review of the first new song Metallica has released since \"Death Magnetic\" came out 8 years ago, back in 2008. Metallica just loves to take forever to release new albums, don't they? Oh well, at least they aren't as bad as Tool! Anyway, this song was released a few years ago. Actually, two. It came out in June of 2014. Although I'm pretty sure I heard it on a live video in March of that year, before the band released the song digitally. I remember this because I was just about to leave for basic training and this was the last song I listened to before I left. So what do we get with this song? \n\nBasically, this is a mix of the thrash metal sound the band played during the latter half of the 1980s, specifically with \"...And Justice For All\". It's lengthy structure and galloping thrash riffs can attest to this. However, it's not really pure thrash. It's not as thrashy as \"Death Magnetic\" was, either. This could only label this song as \"thrash-lite\" to my ears. It's thrash, but only barely. The main riff has that galloping sound but is very repetitive and when the song awkwardly slows down, it sounds like something Metallica would have written for some of the more mellow moments on their 1991 self-titled album or maybe even \"Load.\" It's not terrible but really doesn't fit the song well. This nearly thrash-hard rock hybrid just doesn't sound complete and again, sounds awkward. It's almost as if this song suffers from a slight case of multiple personality disorder or something. It knows not what it is. Thrash metal, heavy metal, or hard rock? Oh well. At least the solo slays! \n\nThe drumming is what Lars was doing back in the 1980s. Very, very thrashy. This style of drumming was again heard on \"Death Magnetic\" after they pretty much ditched it back in 1991. Lars was never that great a drummer to begin with, and this is a well-known fact. Really though, this song sounds almost like a B-side to \"Death Magnetic\". \n\nSo, yes. This is a fairly thrashy song. It can certainly qualify as a thrash metal track in some parts but really, there is a bit of an unwelcome 1990s 'Tallica vibe to it as well. While it is better than a lot of what the band was doing in the 1990s, hopefully, the rest of the new album sounds better than this.\n",
        "\nMetallica is the most overrated band in the metal scene, period. Point blank. They have managed to release one of the worst albums of all time, \"St. Anger\", which still was able to sell to a double platinum status in the United States alone. Yeah, when that happens, something is obviously wrong. \"Ride the Lightning\" is Metallica's second full-length album and was released in 1984. Like the previous album \"Kill 'Em All\", this is an essential and classic piece of thrash metal but this time around, the band's sound has already matured in a positive way. Out of the first four albums, I would say this is probably my second favorite, second only to \"...And Justice for All\". But I'm not here to talk about that album. \"Ride the Lightning\" is, as many have said before, a monumental thrash metal album.\n\n\"Kill 'Em All\" was an all-out thrash/speed metal album with a heavy injection of pissed off punk music, whereas \"Ride the Lightning\" is far more mature and a bit more technical in terms of songwriting and musicianship. There were no acoustic pieces on the previous album. However, right away, the first-time listener of this album was treated to something entirely different back in 1984. Within the intro to \"Fight Fire with Fire\", the album's opening track, a beautiful acoustic guitar riff sets the tone of the album. Or does it? After some acoustic playing, a bombastic thrash riff explodes all over the place. I'm sure many fans of Metallica at this point in time were fearing the worst: oh, no! Acoustic guitars?! They sold out! Of course we now know that couldn't be farther from the truth, but maybe it seemed justifiable at the time. No, Metallica wouldn't \"sell out\" until 1991. This was also the first album by Metallica to feature a ballad and it's actually one of the greatest songs this band has ever written. \"Fade to Black\" is a song dealing with the controversial lyrical theme of suicide. Again, I can guarantee there were fans back in the day that saw this and felt that the band was \"selling out\". I mean, a ballad about suicide? It makes sense. But this song is breathtaking. It starts off somber with a guitar solo and acoustic riffing then the main acoustic riff comes in and its instantly recognizable. The song does end up picking up in pace and turns into what you could call a \"thrash ballad\". The album's closing instrumental number \"The Call of Ktulu\" could probably be considered such as well. This nearly 9-minute piece is, in my opinion, the best instrumental Metallica has ever done and we definitely have Dave Mustaine to thank for writing some of the guitar pieces to this track. \n\nSo yes, there are some softer moments on this album, but even the softer songs turn into thrashers. The title track is a favorite of mine as it was actually one of the first Metallica songs I ever listened to, thanks to my dad's iPod many years back. This song deals with the death penalty, specifically the obvious electric chair (which, of course, made its way onto the album's cover art). It describes the feeling of going through this death penalty. It seems Metallica really was working to include some controversial lyrical themes within this album. \"Creeping Death\" deals with themes of the Biblical plague that spread across Egypt. This was the main single from the album and the title could not do the song more justice. This is definitely one of Metallica's strongest albums lyrically. \n\nOf course, with most Metallica albums aside from \"St. Anger\", guitar solos are very prominent here. All of these songs contain guitar solos, with some of them, such as \"Fade to Black\", containing multiple. They're all executed quite well. This is arguably Metallica's most guitar-driven album, rivaling even \"...And Justice for All\". James' singing is still good here and he hasn't succumbed to the bluesy, almost western style of singing he would eventually adopt. His voice is young and fresh here.\n\nI won't really say much about the drums. No doubt Lars Ulrich is one of the most overrated (I've used that word already...) drummers in history and really doesn't do anything that impressive, ever. His performance here is still tight and thrashy and justifies the music, if it doesn't still sound a bit, well, normal. At least at this point in time, Ulrich wasn't a total tool. I'd say that while \"...And Justice for All\" is my favorite Metallica album overall, this is probably the band's most important, and given its time of release and the album it follows, it's likely the band's most important. It is the Metallica side of The Big Four's most important releases, the others being \"Rust in Peace\" (1990) by Megadeth, \"Hell Awaits\" (1985) by Slayer, and \"Among the Living\" (1987) by Anthrax. These albums are all worthy of \"legendary\" status and are essential thrash pieces. \"Ride the Lightning\" is no exception.\n",
        "\nRIP Metallica 1983-1991. That\u2019s what the elitist thrashers would have you believe. \u201cThe Black Album\u201d was supposedly the end of Metallica\u2019s best years and where they sold out. Instead, this is where Metallica evolved their sound with an innovative approach to their music. This album is slowed down compared to previous records, but that doesn\u2019t make the music any less heavy. They\u2019re no longer thrashing it out a thousand miles an hour every track here. In its place, the music added more dimensions to the sound. Metallica became a great band that could go fast and slow, heavy and melodic, sometimes in the same song. \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d is the best slow song on the album where Metallica does this. The traditionalists shouldn\u2019t be disappointed with this album either, since there are genuinely great fast songs here. \u201cHolier than Thou\u201d and \u201cThrough the Never\u201d fill the void with material that would\u2019ve fit on the classic 1980\u2019s albums. \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d is the Metallica song everyone knows, and you\u2019ll hear it at a football stadium near you. Some tracks are lacking and don\u2019t compare to the gems on this album. Overall, this is a very good album that tries to improve flaws from previous albums.\n\nAs great as \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\" is, a bassist wasn\u2019t needed for that album. The guitars overpowered the bass so much, there\u2019s no bass thump audible to back up the music. \u201cThe Black Album\u201d corrects this mistake, and you can hear the bass clearly throughout the duration. \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d starts off with a bass solo that kicks off the song in the right direction. The bass supplements the heavy guitar playing and the drumming also. The guitars are heard loud and clear just like on the last album, but with more of an overproduced sound. I\u2019m not bothered by the new production, but to each their own. The guitar work itself is very good with a solid variety of tempos and memorable solos. There\u2019s instrumental experimentation on \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d with the sitar, and \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d with orchestral elements, respectively. The drumming is what it is, so to speak. It\u2019s loud and pounding to fit the music, sometimes competing with the guitars. The vocals sound good whether they\u2019re harsh or clean. James Hetfield may not be the best singer, but it\u2019s fun to hear his singing suit the softer moments of the album.\n\nLet\u2019s see how the songs measure up with each other. There are a few catchy songs that have stood the test of time and are heard on the radio, at sporting events, and even during your middle school dance. That\u2019s how wide this album appealed to the masses. Granted, accessibility and quality music usually don\u2019t go hand in hand, but we have an exception to the rule here. \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d is hands down the best song on the album. The Phrygian scale used there sets the atmosphere for a truly crushing metal song. Grooving riffs slow the pace on \u201cSad but True\u201d, but never sacrifice the hard hitting feel of the record. Kid Rock even used the main riff from there for his \"American Bad Ass\" song. Talk about influential. Speaking of which, the first riff from \u201cOf Wolf and Man\u201d sounds like Satyricon on their \u201cNow, Diabolical\u201d album. \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d and \u201cThe Struggle Within\u201d just don\u2019t match up to the rest of the album. \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d is the most polarizing track where Metallica supposedly went soft on. It\u2019s a good song and a ballad, but an acquired taste. \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d wouldn\u2019t feel out of place on \"\u2026And Justice for All\u201d. \u201cThrough the Never\u201d has a \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d feel to it, and was so inspiring it became the title of a Metallica movie. The first five songs are the best on \u201cThe Black Album\u201d (\u201cEnter Sandman\u201d through \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d). From there, the quality varies though every song afterwards certainly isn\u2019t bad. \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d being one of the best of the rest. This is a very good album where the adventure with Bob Rock ended up driving Metallica to their commercial peak.\n\n\u201cThe Black Album\u201d doesn\u2019t deserve the hate it gets. You\u2019d probably get tired of playing the same style of music too, if you did it every day for ten years. It\u2019s still heavy metal with an altered formula that works very well. It\u2019s good to see Metallica has the ability to pull off a slow song that shocks the system like \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d. Not everyone can stray from their typical style and be successful at it. Metallica went from being a great metal band to great rock musicians on this album. It\u2019s not a perfect record, but it became a blueprint for how you could evolve your music while still maintaining your roots. This is considered a classic album for a reason. 85/100\n",
        "\nThis limited Record Store Day live album by American thrash metal legend Metallica is a really interesting release. First of all, it's limited to twenty thousand copies in the world and includes a little certificate that gives you the feeling to own something exclusive. Secondly, the album has the very meaningful title ''Libert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9, Metallica!'' and all profits of this release are donated to the victims of the terrible attacks in Paris last year which is a very good cause in my opinion. Thirdly, the record was recorded at Le Bataclan were the most violent part of those attacks took place and it's a great sign to show that rock and metal music as part of our liberal Western lifestyle have survived and won't adapt, change or vanish in any form despite the rough circumstances. Fourthly, this concert was recorded almost thirteen years ago when the band played three shows at three different locations in Paris in just one day to support the release of the controversial studio record ''St. Anger'' which was a quite unique idea. \n\nSome of the tracks recorded at Le Bataclan had already been used for the recommendable ''Some Kind of Monster'' EP twelve years ago but this is the first time we get to hear the entire concert featuring nine tracks and a running time over one hour. To my surprise, the band only played two songs from said studio album that day and only one was performed at Le Bataclan in form of the unchained ''Frantic'' that sounds quite potent on stage. It would have been interesting to hear more rare live versions of several ''St. Anger'' tunes but this live album still has an interesting selection. \n\nIn fact, the band played a few tracks which aren't performed very often nowadays. Instead of delivering the usual suspects such as ''Master of Puppets'', ''One'' or ''Enter Sandman'', this album features some less popular material that sounds great in concert. The powerful opener ''The Four Horseman'' is among the strongest cuts of this release, the bass-driven stomper ''Leper Messiah'' is also a nice choice just like the chaotically unchained version of ''No Remorse'' or the pitiless closer ''Damage, Inc.''. \n\nConcerning the performance itself, this record includes a few short jam sessions or improvisations but they are never too long or distracting as on earlier live releases like ''Live Shit: Binge and Purge'' that felt more like a circus show at times. The communication between the band and the audience is also solid and the band seems to have fun and develop a solid chemistry despite the new line-up. The fans are quite enthusiastic and give this intimate show a surprisingly powerful atmosphere. \n\nBack in the days, the band wasn't as constantly solid on stage as they were back in the eighties or happen to be nowadays. Especially James Hetfield misses a few notes here and there and even messes up the lyrics of ''Ride the Lightning''. These little mistakes make this record very authentic though and I prefer this raw and natural approach over theatrical larger-than-life experiences on some of the band's other live outputs. This charismatic touch makes this record so outstanding and should immediately appeal to any fan of emotional, powerful and unpolished rock and metal music. \n\nIf you can get your hands on a copy of this limited release, don't hesitate to invest twenty bucks for a good cause and to get a fairly intense live record in return. This might not be Metallica's greatest hour but this album is definitely an entertaining fun ride.\n",
        "\nOh, man. I\u2019m really selling out here! Just like what many people believe Metallica did upon releasing this album. After releasing \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d three years prior in 1988, which is often considered to be the band\u2019s finest album in terms of technicality and musical precision, Metallica released their self-titled album \u201cMetallica\u201d in 1991. Also known as \u201cThe Black Album\u201d, this record is seen as the band\u2019s first major turning point and their \u201csell-out\u201d album. Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of this album and I can see why so many people believe this. I think this is an over-produced album and it\u2019s pretty generic, considering Metallica went from playing a fairly unique brand of thrash metal to a standard 1990s groove oriented heavy metal. This was actually my first metal album period and back when I was 12 or 13, I really dug it. In fact, I\u2019d like this album until I was about 14 years old. After I heard \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d and \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d and then \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d as it had just come out, I was exposed to Metallica\u2019s thrash sound, and this album just fell short of anything else, aside from \u201cLoad\u201d, \u201cReload\u201d, and \u201cSt. Anger\u201d. But I digress. This album is just a generic heavy metal album, but is it terrible? Is it offensive? Not really.\n\nThis album has some decent guitar riffs. Some are just downright groovy and catchy. The only problem I have with this is how damn poppy this album really is. If \u201cpop metal\u201d is a real thing, this album definitely falls into that category. The songs on this album differ greatly from the 9-minute epic tracks of old in favor of shorter songs that generally stay between 4 and 5 minutes long with a few exceptions. Song length doesn\u2019t really matter, as plenty of the tracks on \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d are short, but those songs are more instrumentally proficient and contain cool, thrashy riffs. These songs are just boring most of the time. I guess the younger me thought this was the heaviest thing on the planet but after I grew up, I realized this album was really just not as appealing as I once thought. \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d is the most overplayed and overrated song ever to come out of the heavy metal genre, with its standard cookie cutter riff and annoying wah solo. \u201cSad but True\u201d is another big song from this album but it basically just rehashes what Pantera began doing on their \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d album the year prior to this album. There are some decent songs on this album, ironically the three I\u2019d say I like the most are \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d, \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d, and the melancholic \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d. Why is this ironic? Because the first two of these songs are the other bigger, more well-known tracks from this album. Also, these three songs are slower, more depressing pieces. Heavier songs like the groove metal numbers I mentioned before, as well as songs that border thrash metal such as \u201cThe Struggle Within\u201d and \u201cThrough the Never\u201d actually don\u2019t do it for me this time around. Why? Because they sound like they try too hard to relive the glory years of Metallica but just disappoint more than anything. \n\nThe reason I picked \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d, \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d, and \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d as my favorite songs from this album mainly has to do with how damn somber these songs are. \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d is played mostly on an acoustic guitar with the exceptions of a few riffs and the solo, which while not super impressive, remains one of the song\u2019s highlights. This song has an evident classical influence as well not only with the acoustic guitars, but also the strings in the background. I could imagine the look on many Metallica fans\u2019 faces when they first heard this song. It was probably one of confusion or disgust but to this day, I still listen to this number every now and then. \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d sticks out to me as well, and it\u2019s fairly similar to this song, as it utilizes acoustic guitars as well, but it\u2019s also a bit different at the same time. It focuses on heavier verses and softer, atmospheric choruses. To my ears, there is an evident western feel to this song and the solo is, like \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d, one of the album\u2019s finest. Because let\u2019s face it: most of the solos on this album are just subpar. The final song I\u2019m going to talk about in detail is \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d. Compared to the other two I just went over this song is a bit heavier. It opens with a melancholic bass riff and the riffs follow the same pattern. It doesn\u2019t implement any acoustic guitars and it\u2019s probably my least favorite of these three. However, the atmosphere it possesses is amazing and the lyrics are really deep. Dark Tranquillity from Sweden actually covered this song and managed to make it sound better, in my opinion anyway. \n\nSo, aside from these songs, the guitar here is just plain generic. I already covered how \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d and especially \u201cSad but True\u201d rely on groove over anything but the riffs are just stupid repetitive and simplistic. The thing is, I don\u2019t have a real problem with repetition or simplicity considering some of the other bands I listen to. For Metallica, though, when you compare these tunes to those of the 1980s, you\u2019re going to be disappointed. \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d is another song many people love from this album and sure, I guess the western-style intro (similar to a heavier sounding \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d) sounds kind of cool, but the riffs in this song don\u2019t change hardly at all and it contains another wah guitar solo from Mr. Hammett that just sounds generic and \u201cmeh\u201d. The guitar work on this album pretty much laid the foundation for \u201cLoad\u201d and \u201cReload\u201d in that Metallica essentially dumbed down their music although not as much as they would five years later. \n\nThe production on this album is just\u2026not good. Actually, it is good. Too good. This is one of the most overproduced albums in metal. The instruments have no organic feel to them and I like my metal to sound real. Let\u2019s face it, everything is going to have some sort of flaw. That\u2019s what makes it music and that\u2019s what makes it good in its own way. This album has no dirt whatsoever and is more polished than an old school black army combat boot. The drums are far too loud in the mix. Lars is already an extremely overrated drummer so when you turn up his volume, you take away from the other instruments and are left with a huge \u201cthump thump thump\u201d sound. I wouldn\u2019t mind the drums as much if they weren\u2019t louder than the guitars. The bass is audible, which is nice, although I didn\u2019t really mind the muted bass on the previous album like a lot of people did. Bob Rock is either seen as a legendary producer, or the reincarnation of Satan himself. I won\u2019t say either of these fit my opinion, but I do think he took a lot away from this album by overproducing it so damn much. \n\nJames Hetfield provides a decent vocal performance here but I much prefer his more abrasive style on the band\u2019s thrash albums. Not that he is an aggressive vocalist but he had much more power behind his voice on the first four records. I won\u2019t say too much about his singing, though, as I believe he is one of the most overrated singers in heavy metal. His voice is decent but I\u2019m just not one to fan boy over him. \n\nSo, what\u2019s the verdict here? \u201cMetallica\u201d is a 1990s heavy metal album that really just sounded like most of what other bands were doing at the time. Megadeth also began releasing fairly commercial-sounding stuff around this time, beginning in 1992, but the songwriting on all of their 1990s efforts is so much better than Metallica managed to achieve with this album. Sure, I like about three of the songs on this album quite a bit. But is that enough for me to say this is a solid album? Is it even good? Not really. But, as I asked earlier, is it terrible or offensive? No, I wouldn\u2019t go that far. It\u2019s just a generic metal album that falls very short of those that came before it. So there you have it. One of the most famous, as well as infamous, albums in history. The highly commercial self-titled release from Metallica.\n",
        "\nAlmost hit the 100th review mark and I haven't reviewed anything by 'tallica 'til now. Bad Xyrth, bad Xyrth! After all, this is the band that started it all for me and I don't want to sound overtly preachy, but when it comes to this masterpiece I just have to have my say. It has become sort of a rite of passage for any aspiring metalhead that considers him or herself serious enough to be accepted and approved by their fellows to actually dislike or even hate Metallica and shit upon their legacy. Nowadays it's like a sign that you are tough & trve enough; that you've reached maturity and no longer care for \u201cmainstream\u201d metal and only listen to the \u201creal stuff\u201d. Well, I was born in '84, so I was two years old when Master of Puppets arrived to the unprepared World, and I just can't picture a metalhead from that time saying, after listening to this album: \u201cbah, Metallica is shit, this album is crap, it was nothing of value and it will kill metal, what a bunch of posers they are!\u201d Nah, such phrases have been uttered more and more in recent times, mostly by fellow metalheads who were born or raised after Metallica's defining masterpiece, and during or after their fall from grace. It truly makes me sad. But\u2026 not too much, because then I blast this beast and I forget about those misplaced outcries of trve-ism. \n\nMaster of Puppets undoubtedly deserves all high accolades it receives and has received throughout its entire existence. There was nothing like this in '86; a thrash metal band pushing the boundaries of what metal was supposed to be. 6 to 8-minute songs that were artsy, complex, punishing and memorable AT THE SAME TIME? No one was doing that in mid-eighties, at least not with this level of vision and quality. Sure, there were (arguably) more complex compositions produced by the likes of Fates Warning or Watchtower, and definitely faster, darker, more brutal stuff like Slayer, Dark Angel, Kreator or Possessed, but their extreme paths came at the cost of accessibility. You don't like accessible metal you say? Well, then what are you doing listening to \u201cWar Pigs\u201d, \u201cBreaking the Law\u201d, or \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d? Not everything in this life is Malmsteen-esque soloing and blastbeating your brain to pulp, folks. Metallica surely changed the game, and influenced both mainstream metal and the underground with a type of thrash metal that was challenging, otherworldly but also engaging and appealing to almost everyone with a taste for heavy music. \n\nSo let's pretend for a minute that this album holds neither Historic significance nor importance. Is it good on its own musical merits? You bet your ass it is! The acoustic intro of \u201cBattery\u201d mimics what they did on their also stellar Ride the Lightning with its own opener, \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d, a trait that would be in turn mimicked by a great deal of thrash metal acts in the subsequent years. \u201cBattery\u201d is again, a powerful, high-octane thrash number, but as it happens with most of Metallica's releases each song here has a distinct set of characteristics which grants them a personality of their own. Nothing could have prepared the World for the masterpiece that is the next song and title-track, an epic 8-minute tale of drug addiction abuse metaphorically compared to the whims of a sick deity holding sway of its adorers. The two 6-minute tunes that follow in its wake are also top-notch timeless metal classics, and favorites of mine from this once mighty band. \u201cThe Thing that Should Not Be\u201d equates Lovecraft's creations given dreadful life via thrash metal that actually sounds quite doomy, a staple literary theme for bands that came after 'tallica, especially many that arose from the fiendish plane known as death metal, half a decade after this. \u201cSanitarium\u201d is a quite proggy composition that appears to be the spiritual continuation of \u201cFade to Black\u201d but gets heavier and heavier as it goes. Most tunes here deal with some sort of madness and the mechanics of control. Some are faster, some are more atmospheric, some are more straightforward while other are more ambitious compositions, but none are boring, I can assure you that. \n\nLegends are true, my metal brothers and sisters; Lars actually was a very capable drummer once, and his syncopation on this album is plain genius, in particular in track number two. He was never the most technical or faster, but he undeniable kept things interesting and unexpected. It bugs me a bit that his double bass was not as audible as in other albums by other metal acts of the time, and that's my only complain with the production work of Master of Puppets. The rest of the Horsemen are on fire as well. Hetfield's timeless riffs are colossal, and when people say that the true force behind Metallica was Dave Mustaine I can only laugh at the notion, just like the Ray Liotta meme. Now, MegaDave is an awesome guitar player, but riff by riff, James is the man. I find Megadeth forte residing in their melodies and solos, but the rhythmic guitar playing of Hetfield is just monstrous (was, anyway), particularly crushing in \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d. So stop mentioning Dave, if you please. There's no need to compare, one can enjoy both bands and musicians. As for Kirk Hammett, he was quite alright before the wah-wah plague invaded his mind. He played with more feeling than technique, and I'm thankful for that. Otherwise this album might have turned out too technical for its own good and the balance would be lost. The calm moments and solos on \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d and \u201cSanitarium\u201d are pure magic, but he shreds when he need to also, as heard on the vicious \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d. As for the bass player, what was his name\u2026 Well, enough has been said about the great Cliff, so I won't say much about him, save for this: \u201cOrion\u201d\u2026 If your don't love that bass, you're dead inside. We still miss him, despite the awesome players that took his place. \n\nAnother iconic cover artwork for the most iconic 1986 album in metal, and there you have it: a 55 minute masterpiece that sounds as amazing today as it sounded 30 years ago when it was unleashed. Even though much has transpired since then and Metallica became one of rock's biggest acts in the World to the chagrin of many hardened metal fans, with some of the band members' actions being more than just annoying and the band as a whole rightfully accused of \u201cselling-out\u201d, there's just nothing than can erase what they did to the elevate the power and quality in the music we love, nothing that anybody can say or do that will undermine their gargantuan influence on the musical panorama. But 30 years ago, this four young guys in San Francisco, CAL., just wanted to metal as hard as they were able to and couldn't foresee how much impact their magnum opus would have. Accusing them of consciously shaping the metal world for worse is just as mature and real as Kerry King growing his head hair again and riding a unicorn to Orion. I'm not Manowar, so if you don't like this album we could still be friends, I just wouldn't understand it, just as I don't understand free-will inbreeding, people reading \u201cTwilight\u201d books or drinking light beer.\n",
        "\nLet me get something of my chest first of all. Lots and lots of fine folks keep talking about the sound mixing on this record and how god awful bad that it is. I don't agree. While the mixing isn't great it isn't terrible either. Yes it's weird sounding especially the drum sound but the guitar sound is massive and clean. The important thing is the guitar sound with this type of music. \n\nNow that I have got that off my chest. What we have here is a record that takes a long time to get used to. First and foremost that is the truth. You have songs with so much going on it can be really tough getting to the point and knowing what is going on with them. Case in point is the song Shoot Me Again. You have so many moving parts in the song itself. What do I mean by moving parts? I mean the guitars, drums vocals and everything that makes up a song have breathing room to do anything they want. It is very unpredictable and that unpredictability can be very moving to a person listening to the music recorded on the album. \n\nTracks such as Shoot Me Again, The Unnamed Feeling and Some Kind of Monster I really enjoy. I love the places I go when hearing them being performed. They all feature riffs well worth hearing. Granted Some Kind Of Monster could use some time being trimmed off of it. But still that track is well worth hearing. There is a riff in this particular track around the six and a half minute mark that just rules hard. It's not very aggressive on a very aggressive album and it still comes on strong and it's a feeling I just can't explain.\n\nSongs like Frantic and Dirty Window feature very aggressive riffs but zero soloing. In fact the entire record is absent of them. This is the major problem with this album. To go from having solos on just about every song the band has ever done to having none at all is a huge gamble. A very bad one in the entire history of heavy metal music. This is the major reason I am giving the record a 63. Neither of these two songs are over long and that means very good things are happening in these two tracks. It is just to bad they do not have solos in them. Both tracks feature lyrics that at least make some kind of sense. The problem is though most of the songs on this record do not feature great lyrics but it ends up not mattering.\n\nThe lyrical ideas are secondary with records like this. And if you are like me you probably think the same way. With these type of albums it is all about aggression and even though the lyrics being sung aren't even close to being high quality you still have good to great riffing that gets the blood pumping and do not forget the bass. Bob Rock played bass on this album and did a great job. His bass can be heard in certain places and can be heard well and sounds great while being heard. \n\nThen you have songs like Invisible Kid that wear out their welcome way to quickly. No way in hell does this song have a right to be over eight minutes long. It is literally just one maybe two riffs the whole way through. It is much better to just skip this track but if people insist on listening just remember the song writing here is sub-par. \n\nBut don't let that stop you because the very next song picks things up greatly. My World is that song and I like it a lot. The riffs are much more well spread out and there are more of them. That means more breathing room. Remember my mentioning that earlier? It's the truth especially here with this song. Great riffs with time changes galore that add to the experience not disable it. \n\nDo listen to the record and make up your own mind. But do listen all the way through. I did and still enjoy the album many years after first listening.\n",
        "\nMetallica must have been under a lot of pressure at this point in time. They had just released their 1986 album Master of Puppets album, which went gold without any airplay at all, and was considered one of the best thrash albums of all time, not to mention metal in general. Needless to say, they had a lot to follow up. So, what did they decide to do? Go bigger and better and this is just what they did. The problem with this, though, is that they went too big.\n\nSee, the track times are probably the biggest problem with this record. The shortest track time is over five minutes, and there are two tracks knocking on the door of ten minutes. I don't have a problem with long track times, so long as they make an attempt to keep the listener interested. Take, for example, Iron Maiden's Paschendale or Dance of Death which clocked in at over eight minutes, but are littered with tempo changes, interesting bridges, and all kinds of little nuggets to keep the two songs from being a chore to listen to. Such is not the case for a lot of songs on AJFA. They tend to be repetitive, and have simple song structures: (verse 1, chorus, verse 2, chorus, solo/instrumental section, verse 3, chorus). The biggest culprit for this is the title track, which runs for 9:46. It starts off with an acoustic intro, which is likely the most interesting thing the track has to offer as far as variation goes. After that, the heavy riffs come in. Don't get me wrong; this is a great song with a great intro and verses and chorus, but it starts losing me during the instrumental section after the solo and it goes through another verse, chorus, and outro before it ends. The members of Metallica have acknowledged this themselves.\n\nOther songs have similar repetition such as The Shortest Straw and The Frayed Ends of Sanity. The former is saved by it's relentless pace and blistering solo. The latter is OK, but it never really did much for me besides a memorable tribute to The Wizard of Oz in the intro. It is the only track I can do without. To Live is to Die is beautiful, great solo and spoken word parts but my least favorite Metallica epic instrumental, because it is too long, and honestly doesn't seems like it has a direction. \n\nWell, now that we got rid of the negativity out of the way, let's focus on the good, of which there is a lot. The guitarists Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield are in top form delivering excellent riffs and solos at each turn, including the famous guitar solos in Blackened and One. James Hetfield's voice is angrier than ever, and has developed and deepened substantially since their earlier albums. Even Lars Ulrich, usually considered Metallica's poster boy for his below average performances in recent years, was excellent on the drums, particularly on the track Dyer's Eve, which is a template for what drummers should strive for. Sadly, the bassist Jason Newsted is invisible in the album, which is another criticism for the album, as well as the dry production.\n\nSimilar to Metallica's previous albums, there is a central theme that winds its way through the album. For Master of Puppets, it was control; for Ride the Lightning, it was death; and for Kill Em' All, it was METAHL RAWKS! For this album, the band matures a little and discusses their views on politics. Topics include the Apocalypse, greed, limitations on freedom of speech, war, and blacklisting. Harvester of Sorrow and Frayed Ends of Sanity deal with mental illness; a more traditional theme for Metallica. The final two songs are much more personal. To Live is to Die is a ten-minute-long semi-ballad semi-instrumental with only a few spoken-word lines dedicated to their bassist Cliff Burton, who was tragically killed in a bus crash. The final track, Dyer's Eve, is a fuck you to Hetfield's parents for sheltering him as a child. The lyrics are very well done.\n\nWithout a doubt, One is the best song on the album, the best song by Metallica, and one of the best songs ever written. The song tells the heartbreaking tale of a soldier who lost his limbs and senses in an explosion and is forced to spend the rest of his life trapped in his immobile body in a hospital bed. The song starts out slow and ballad-like, like previous track fours Fade to Black and Welcome Home. After time, the song grows in heaviness, and after the vocals cut out, the song really takes off, showcasing that famous machine gun riff and face-melting solo. It's incredible from start to finish.\n\nOther standouts include the opener, Blackened, which is speedy and heavy all the way through, featuring an excellent intro, solo, riff, bridge, chorus, etc. Harvester of Sorrow is the darkest song ever put out by the band. You gotta love the clean intro to this one. Eye of the Beholder, which is often considered filler, is another winner, mostly for the main riff and vocal melodies. Dyer's Eve is one of the fastest, heaviest Metallica songs out there, with standout drumming.\n\nSo, there you have it. Yes the flaws are formidable, but that should not stop you from picking this up. A must have for any thrash-metal fan.\n",
        "\nMaster Of Puppets is easily, one of the greatest metal albums of all time. The record forever changed the world of metal. It's influence cannot be denied. Critical acclaim from critics and musicians alike, it is an album of great esteem. Metallica was still a fledgling band at the time, but they had put out two masterpieces in a row, and Master Of Puppets continued that trend all the way until their self titled. Some of the most famous metal tracks such as \"Master Of Puppets\" helped Metallica cement their legacy alongside metal behemoths such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.\n\nThe record itself is musically rich and diverse. It is full of the classic Metallica nuances that fans became used to, but with added progressive and melodic elements thanks to the genius of Cliff Burton (R.I.P.), the brilliant songwriting of Lars & James, and Kirk's timeless solos on tracks such as \"Disposable Heroes\", a mighty thrash anthem that is one of Metallica's greatest epics. Tracks such as \"Battery\" \"Leper Messiah\" & \"Damage Inc.\" highlight Metallica's thrash mastery, pumping out adrenaline in an artful and ingenious way. The more progressive & melodic tracks such as \"Master Of Puppets\" & \"Orion\" show a side of Metallica that had not been yet seen, and it showed the musician progression and how it had leaped bounds since their inception. \n\nThe individual musical performances cannot be underestimated, while other albums that were released during the same year boasted mighty performances of the likes of Dave Lombardo On \"Reign In Blood\", Metallica was no slouch in that department despite what people say. The album is full of brilliant instrumental performances. James himself wrote the some of the greatest riffs of all time in this album alone, \"Master Of Puppets\" is the quintessential \"riff\" song in my humble opinion. Kirk pumped out some of the most iconic solos of all, and even in their simplicity, they are creative and well thought out pentatonic shredders. Lars is on top of his game here, as a drummer myself, Lars was a force not be reckoned with. His songwriting capabilities were already of high quality, but his drumming in this album is the singular reason millions of drummers started playing. Whether you like his playing or not, Lars influenced almost every metal drummer in existence today. His performance itself is strong and impacting. The albums iconic double bass parts in \"Battery\" \"Disposable Heroes\" \"Leper Messiah\" & Damage Inc.\" still have fans mesmerized to this day. Last but not least, Mr. Cliff Burton. He is the primary reason the album turned out the way it did. His melodic sensibilities and knowledge of classical music helped Metallica's transcend from their primitive (yet brilliant) beginnings of Kill Em All. (Ride The Lightning is my preference, but MOP expanded upon it and improved upon it.) The bass playing itself is brilliant, Cliff keeps his trademark \"lead\" bass on tracks like \"Orion\" a masterpiece that he wrote himself, highlighting Cliff's musical prowess in a mere 8 minutes of pure musical ecstasy. Cliff was one of the first \"bass virtuosos\". His bass playing is powerful, driving & at times sensitive. \n\nMy sole qualm with the album exists with its production; because it is very dry and stale and makes the album a tad bit tedious to listen to, (excluding the guitar tones, because they are very good.) Besides from that minor issue, this album is a masterpiece that forever changed the very fabrics of metal music.\n",
        "\nOne way I've tended to look at KEA the last few years is in comparison to Justice. Both albums are on the periphery of two albums that have a general consensus of greatness, and to make a sweeping statement or two they're both considered really really good but perhaps not as really really good as the monoliths that are Lightning and Puppets (I'm not sure that applies strictly on the Archives, but I'm fairly comfortable with that assertion in a wider context). Plus, there's just a few neat opposites- on this album we have angry youths trying something new in rather stark contrast to the older road dogs taking the thing they've created as far as it can go in Justice, with related pros and cons.\n\nYeah, a bunch of delinquents taking what they knew, making it a bit crazier, and creating/helping to create an entirely new genre. Another reviewer on this site (I think it was Empyreal) did a good job articulating this elsewhere- one of the reasons early, boundary pushing 80's metal is so fascinating is that the members were taking their influences and then just trying to write the craziest stuff possible, as opposed to relying on well established formulas. And yeah, as with a lot of really innovative, far out releases, it's an approach that is generally great but tends to fall apart here and there. You've got the boring, shitty slog that is the bass solo, the occasional goofy nwobhm-ish thing in No Remorse, the disco stomp that's Jump in The Fire- and perhaps that's why KEA falls slightly short of the next two albums. Again, you could contrast this with Justice, where things have been fairly well codified and written in stone by that point and thus the mood is just this consistently dark thing throughout with hardly anything that's recognizably pre-thrash.\n\nThe reason why this album gets 90% though is because for the most part, the youthful energy works brilliantly.Certainly it's the rawest Metallica album- still quite hifi if you compare it to the other big 4 debuts- but yeah, it's rough, raw, razor sharp in all of it's biting, trebly menace; a perfect fit for what the band was doing at the time. It's unquestionably the most energetic studio Metallica performance, and considering it's a thrash album you would certainly say that's a good thing! Moments like Whiplash, the ATTTTTAAAAACK part of No Remorse, Metal Militia so on and so forth are just these beautiful things to behold, with a vigour and intensity that most bands to this day still have trouble matching. Whiplash is just one of those moments that is just such joyous, energetic, furious fun that you have to wonder why it was never considered before. Why Priest didn't think of speeding up Exciter a bit more again, why Maiden never got that little bit quicker, why Diamond Head didn't make Am I Evil just that little bit faster and meaner. It just seems totally natural. It's metal as we know it, finally freed itself of its' shackles. Once more, I'm drawn to a Justice comparison, which for all of the great material in the album had put the cuffs firmly back on for the sake of a \"composed\" feel.\n\nA quick comment on a fairly big part of the album that I haven't mentioned yet- the Four Horseman. It's a bit of oddity, the most epic track here, the most tempo changes by a mile, the longest, the biggest precursor to what was going to happen next with the band. Straight away it's just proof of what was Metallica's unique place in the big 4- Slayer were heavier, Megadeth, more technical, Anthrax were, uh, well they did more bad rap collabs. What we see here is Metallica establishing themselves rather early as the kings of the epic, as the songwriting masters of the quartet of bands, with a pretty lengthy tune that's immense in scope but also pure pleasure the whole way. \n\nThe final thing to think about, then- is this album any good still? Just because something's tremendously influential doesn't mean it's still worth listening to, short of academic interest. I'd raise you the entire genre of Opera is incontrovertible proof. Luckily, the answer's yes. The production is dated- but in an appealingly raw fashion, like an old pair of jeans, as opposed to shoulder pads and a perm. And sure, it's hardly the heaviest thing out there anymore, but it's still a very energetic, often intense album, with the capacity to annoy a very large amount of people. That said, as mentioned earlier, it's not perfect and you can certainly see a few moments which with hindsight look a bit weak- Seek and Destroy could potentially be argued as the first groove metal/post thrash song, and without chunky production it's just a relentlessly boring chug fest, Hit the Lights is possibly a bit too solo-y, and the less said about Pulling Teeth the better. Fact of the matter is though is that 7 out of the 10 songs are classics and for good reason- fast, energetic, passionate with excellent riff craft throughout.\n\n\nTo conclude, a classic album that is worth owning for historical influence , listening pleasure, and the simple but rather rad album artwork. It's not perfect but it's quite great.\n\n\n-Quick post script, I don't think there's any point dwelling on Mustaine v Hetfield kinda thing in terms of who wrote what and the like, as both bands produced works far greater than this when they were obviously free of any influence on each other. It is of course very awesome that two great songwriters managed to make most of an album together though.\n",
        "\nHighly motivated by the increasing success of their first two productions, Metallica released their third album which had a very positive worldwide reception, an impressive number of sales, and a sound that attracted the youngsters who were really hungry for thrash and violence. But unfortunately, it seems that the band started to suffer a burnout on their compositions. Even worse, it seems that the composing work was left to the wrong guy. James Hetfield undeniably is a good musician, but not exactly an innovative nor a brilliant songwriter. As a consequence, the songs started to turn into tiresome compositions rather than an engaging thrash metal stuff.\n\nAs a consequence, the band started to experiment with some weird riffs and an unnecessary slow-down in the tempos of certain songs (e.g., the title song), not to mention the ridiculous whatchamacallit ballad that is \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\", and let's just leave things at that. This album seems to be the blueprint on which the songs of the next following releases were made, and unexplainably, this was the music that they played when Hetfield promised to feature the haunting old sound that brought American thrash metal into a higher level of aggression and insanity in an upcoming album. \n\nThe alleged forceful thrasher \"Battery\" results an interesting song that follows the structure of \"Fight Fire with Fire\" (i.e., an acoustic intro followed by some thunderous riffs that lead things into a fast song \"a la old-days\"); thereafter, the album became a bad attempt of technical/progressive thrash metal. An example is once again, the terrible title-song which repeats the same mid-paced riff during more than seven minutes! Indeed, that repetitive riff that would be featured in songs like \"Holier than Thou\". \n\nAnd to make it more annoying, the unnecessary tempo break that takes place almost at the half of the song, seems to be the prototype for \"One\", and the bunch of ballads that made up the stuff from their sold-out days (that started right in 1986!) from which they cannot even give a single sign of recovery. Did all of you have notice it? Here is where the attempt of making a cover of the Diamond Head song \"Am I Evil?\" was turned into a boring and excessively arranged piece of crap which is far from taking back the spirit of the almost dying NWOBHM, but it rather seemed to provide the band with some ideas for their \"Black Album\".\n\nThen, the Side B was filled with some excessively long-lengthy songs that sound like a terrible rip-off from their previous albums. When no one could ever think about a low-paced instrumental, they saw a perfect opportunity for including such a repetitive and a boring eight minutes long instrumental titled \"Orion\" which could be a little bit shorter so that it becomes as straightforward as thrash metal itself rather than a copy of \"The Call of Ktulu\". On the other hand, the closing song started as a very promising thrasher, but the band managed to ruin whatever that was positive about the song. It just became another clich\u00e9 which apparently repeated some of the structure of \"Metal Militia\", but taking away any possible form of madness and outrageous fury that made the latter an essential song for the pit. Regarding the rest of the songs, it is better to avoid any comment.\n\nWhile the band tried to impress the world with the silent change on their musical direction, they neglected to take care about the stuff they were making. But fortunately for the band, the production work of Rasmussen slightly disguised their worrying lack of ideas, and now the lambs were easily taken to the slaughter. That said, the band started to suffer a slow and very hidden decadence that would be realized until 1995. In the meantime, the band released many albums that started to show their need of a substitute for Dave Mustaine, since Hetfield seemed to be unable to meet the qualities of the former on guitars. This album has nothing interesting to contribute to the metal world, but just some riffs for non-metal bands like Nirvana (e.g., the intro guitars of \"The Thing that Should Not Be\"). It is just recommended for die-hard fans of the band.\n",
        "\nBack in the winter of 2014, Metallica surprised fans by not only playing a new song live; but they also released a demo recording of the song to the public. Lords of Summer was released in March of 2014 with a full release title of Lords of Summer (Garage Demo Version) and with anything Metallica releases, of course the track was panned by fans and critics. But ultimately, if you go back to June and August of 2006 when Metallica released the New Song and the Other New Song prior to \"Death Magnetic\" and compare the general consensus with Lords of Summer, you will definitely see that the reviews have been a bit more positive. Not by much; but still a bit more in favour towards the track. \n\nLords of Summer is a Hetfield/Ulrich/Trujillo written track and even though this song was released to the general public; we should still consider this track a demo because, well, it's a demo. The production is not a good example of how Metallica should sound; but it's raw and it's still enjoyable to listen to. Yes, the distortion is a little weak at times, especially on the main riff throughout the track; but if you can get passed that and try to hear what it would sound like as an actual finished product, you might be able to enjoy it a bit more. If you are able to get passed the production values of the track you will notice that the structure is much more organic than previous Metallica songs from recent years. A lot of their newer efforts feel a bit messy when it comes to song structure and Lords of Summer is definitely a step in the right direction. The track still clocks in 8 minutes and 20 seconds; but structurally feels tight, compact and organic. \n\nRight from the top of the song, the opening section brings us back to \"Kill 'Em All\" with a Phantom Lord vibe that consists of drawn out chords and heavy tom-toms creating a mid-tempo groove which leads into the main riff. The direction that the main riff takes us is a thrash vibe that feels very old school for Metallica that continues into the verses. Much of this track is \"Kill 'Em All\" inspired; but once the chorus hits, the vibe that we get is something that Black Sabbath would write, which is a very solid choice for Metallica at this point in their career. Even though the song is long, It follows a very simple formula and the main body of the song is comprised of two iterations of a verse, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. After the second chorus, Metallica move onto a riff with a vibe that is reminiscent of The Wait, a song by Killing Joke they covered back in the 1980's. This riff leads us into the lead guitar break and again, the song structure is more organic, bringing back the structure you can find on Metallica's 1988 studio effort \"... And Justice for All\" and bringing us full circle by ending with a third chorus. \n\nThe words are reminiscent of some of the Dungeons & Dragons imagery that can be found on their debut album, \"Kill 'Em All\". This is of course, the first impression one would get when listening to the track. After a few more listens though, lines such as \"Re-animated by fire\" could insinuate that the Dungeons & Dragons imagery could be currently adopted as a sort of metaphor for Metallica feeling inspired; almost feeling as if they have been brought back to life by the fire of playing fast music again. While Hetfield's lyrics from \"Death Magnetic\" seemed kind of vague for most of the tracks, the lyrics on Lords of Summer definitely seem like they were approached with an actual subject and feel more organized than the former release from 2008. \n\nIn conclusion, is this a perfect song? No, not by a long shot; but Lords of Summer is a great effort by Metallica and a positive step in the right direction. For their next album, Metallica would be wise to keep their songs shorter this time around. Four and five minute songs would be ideal for them; but if Lords of Summer is an indication of how they are arranging their longer tracks nowadays, then a warm welcome for the track is needed! Imagine 1983 Metallica playing this track and with a little bit of tweaking here and there, it would sit well with the other songs on \"Kill 'Em All\". Lords of Summer is modern Metallica playing a song that could have been written in 1982 with a 1987 arrangement. Overall, a solid effort by the band.\n",
        "\nOnce upon a time, Metallica were a premier band in the thrash metal scene. Regardless of later efforts, Metallica left a mark on the metal world that is still felt today. The band\u2019s debut stands the test of time as an album of raw energy and creative youth; however, Ride the Lightning is the next logical step in the band\u2019s evolution. To this day, I cannot name another band that progressed as far between debut and sophomore releases. \n\nMetallica\u2019s aggression is more contained and focused on Ride the Lightning than earlier recordings. \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d displays the band\u2019s maturity. A taunting intro braces the listener for a full on assault, before accosting the ears with buzz saw guitars and pounding drums. Hetfield sounds like a madman on the microphone, spitting hate for the world and nuclear politics. The vocal lines are a tad odd, but they do give the listener ample time to absorb and appreciate the depth of the nightmarish scenario. Hammett has never been the best of lead players, but he always manages to throw in a solo that perfectly fits the song.\n\nThe tempo is slowed for the next two songs, \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d and \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls.\u201d The former is both crushing and melodic, with lyrics that tackle the morality of the death penalty. A pummeling bass line complements the latter, and the slow, chugging guitar riff helps tell a story about the horrors of war. Hetfield\u2019s progression as a vocalist shines through, making his performance on \u201cKill Em All\u201d sound pedestrian by comparison.\n\n\u201cFade to Black\u201d is perhaps Metallica\u2019s most famous tune. Personally, I like the song, but I find it to be one of the weakest on the album. The smooth intro and beautifully haunting main riff does give the song merit; as does the testament to Hetfield\u2019s improvement as a vocalist, but the song somewhat disrupts the flow of the album. The next song is a straight up slab of chunky thrash, followed by the most controversial song on the album.\n\n\u201cEscape\u201d is often accused of being a \u201cfiller\u201d track, or simply too far out of place. Both complaints are understandable, but the song is definitely solid, if a bit too reserved and catchy. \u201cCreeping Death\u201d is Metallica\u2019s greatest song, completely deserving of all form of praise. The main riff is the epitome of skull smashing brutality, seasoned with a touch of melody and topped with a wonderful lead. Death is the only fitting description for anyone who doesn\u2019t experience an immediate surge of adrenaline upon hearing the malevolent thrash break. Finally, the band concludes with an instrumental: an eight minute epic: good, but slightly too lengthy.\n\nIt should be noted that Metallica managed one of the best guitar sounds of all time on Ride the Lightning. Words cannot do justice to the impressive, sonic \u201ccrunch\u201d this album portrays. Along with the classic production, Ride the Lightning has very few challengers to the throne of metallic bliss. Lyrically speaking, the band also stands apart from the norm. For the time, Metallica might have been considered the heaviest band outside the underground. \n\nMy only complaint about this album is the drums. Lars is clearly the weakest link in the band. He does a decent enough job in the rhythm department, but he lacks the skill displayed by many of his thrash contemporaries. The bass could have been a little louder as well, but none of these negatives should prevent a potential fan from purchasing this masterpiece.\n(rating was slightly lowered after careful analysis)\n",
        "\nNothing can be said of Metallica that hasn\u2019t already been said. To deny the band\u2019s early work often sounds more like sour grapes than actual criticism. Metal fans are entitled to their opinion of course, but I believe Metallica were once masters of a unique blend of thrash. Cliff Burton\u2019s pianist training gave the band a flavor that set them apart from their peers. Unfortunately, none of the elements that made Metallica great are present on this contaminated mound of garbage. \n\nPeople often tell me that this album is simply misunderstood. Misunderstood say you? Simply put, this album is a musical abortion of excessive ideas, most of which sucked all hopes and dreams from the listener. St. Anger is about as appealing as herpes or testicular piercing. It boggles my mind that Metallica actually considered this album a \u201cstatement.\u201d St. Anger is a statement of a dead band, worthy of pity and contempt from the fans.\n\nA sickening, growing hatred will consume anyone within seconds of pressing the play button. \u201cFrantic\u201d kicks off the album with a muddy slew of filth. Bob Rock should have been executed by firing squad for allowing this album to be produced in such a fashion. The guitars sound like a mallcore kid recorded them in a basement, whilst being violated by a rabid hermaphrodite. Lars apparently wanted a different drum sound for this album. It seems Lars has suffered from a brain aneurysm, for the drums sound like a two-year-old beating his fist into a defective garage door. Hetfield miraculously lost the ability to sing on this auditory abomination. The very man that delivered the viscous \u201cFight Fire With Fire\u201d now sounds like an emo teenager, who remains in a semi-conscious state of painful masturbation. The bass guitar sounds like fecal waste, and Metallica\u2019s lyrical ability is nowhere to be found.\n\nWhat the hell happened to the band\u2019s technical ability? Production aside, Metallica sound like amateurs. The drum patterns are basic, lacking fills and character, while James and Kirk can\u2019t seem to write a riff to save their lives. The title track opens with an awful rendition of Korn, followed by a semi-decent high tempo tease, that makes the listener think they\u2019re in for some kind of improvement. All hopes are crushed when the main verse resembles the trash found on popular radio. Every song plods along; endlessly, prolonging the sheer pain of trying to complete this \u201cmisunderstood\u201d effort. Guitar solos are nowhere to be found, lost in the same void that took Metallica\u2019s talent for melody from our hearts. \n\nIt is almost impossible to distinguish between tracks-they all sound the same. The only reason St. Anger can muster such a \u201chigh\u201d rating, is the occasional moment of decency; decency akin to shooting someone in the head after sticking nails in his scrotum. Metallica have reached all time lows with St. Anger, but ironically, this is not the worst album ever made.\n\n\nThankfully, Metallica make a recovery on their next effort.\n",
        "\nThe album we got from Metallica in 1991 was a complete reaction to the album we got in 1988 from Metallica. In 1988, Metallica released their fourth studio album titled \"...And Justice for All\", which featured some of the group's longest running cuts, with only two tracks being under six minutes. As the band toured their 1988 studio album; the problems revolving around the track lengths started to develop. There's a quote from lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, regarding not only the album itself; but the title track as well, where he stated: \"Touring behind it, we realized that the general consensus was that the songs were too fucking long. One day after we played 'Justice' and got off the stage, one of us said, 'we're never fucking playing that song again.'\" Metallica bravely wanted a change, and when rhythm guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich began arranging new material in the middle of 1990, they took that want very seriously as they focused on writing shorter, tighter, and more compact tracks that would end up making the 12 songs for \"The Black Album\". \n\nWhich brings us to the song that made Metallica a house-hold name. Enter Sandman was the first song to be written for the album and strangely enough was the last song to have the lyrics written. Regarding the running order of the album, Hetfield and producer Bob Rock both wanted the track Holier than Thou to not only be the album's first single; but to also be the track that opened up the album. From the album's conception though, Ulrich always thought the demo that would end up becoming Enter Sandman was going to be the album's opener and debated Hetfield and Rock on the subject. Enter Sandman was released as the album's first single in July 1991 and ultimately opened the record. Metallica had worked hard during the previous decade with very limited radio airplay and video rotation; they owe much of their success in the 1980's to their constant touring and respected live performances. When Metallica released Enter Sandman in 1991, radio and MTV would finally embrace the group and the song became a huge hit, even making the album the band's first to be number one on the Billboard Charts. \n\nUltimately, the goal for Hetfield and Ulrich when arranging their new material was to create songs that had one or two solid riffs used for the duration of the tracks and Enter Sandman is the perfect example of this mission that Metallica had set out to accomplish. The song opens with one of the strongest build-ups in the history of music which also plays a significant role for Metallica. The material on previous Metallica albums, while being tight, was also very stiff. There is no denying this and even the band reflects on their older material with this respect. Opening with Hetfield's clean guitar tone and Ulrich's tom-tom heavy performance on the drums, the track soon heads into familiar territory, being that famous Hetfield chug. So we set ourselves up for more of that tightness and stiffness that we have grown accustomed to when listening to Metallica. The build-up is subjected to literally constructing the song for us with each band member kind of off in their own world. Complementing each other; but off in their own world. It isn't until the first minute mark that the group finally come together and jam on Hammett's main riff, the basis for the song. It was at this point one could realize we were in for something completely different. It's almost as if Metallica were kicking our doors down and announcing to the world: \"Here we are! Now bask in our groove and our loose vibes!\" In one minute, Metallica had ingeniously completely changed their entire musical atmosphere; evolving from their stiff past and welcoming their future in loose grooves. \n\nOverall, Enter Sandman runs for five and a half minutes and manages to retain the same groove throughout its full duration. It follows a very simple formula and the main body of the song is comprised of two iterations of a verse, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. The lyrics deal with a subject that Metallica at that point had yet to write about in their decade long career, nightmares. The second verse in particular sums up the subject quite well with Hetfield's \"Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragon\u2019s fire and of things that will bite.\" After the second chorus, Metallica unleash Hammett for a very memorable lead-break which leads directly into the song's breakdown. This section borrows heavily from the song's opening; a major difference being Hetfield taking the opportunity to recite and put an evil twist on an old children's nursery rhyme. He even goes as far as teaching a child his new evil take on the rhyme and having him repeat everything being said. We are then built back up into the song's final chorus as the band begin to play the opening section; only this time in reverse. We had a build-up and now we have a build-down, which slowly fades out for the track's final moments. \n\nIn conclusion, yes, the song One from \"...And Justice for all\" did receive a decent amount of airplay and video rotation; but it was Enter Sandman that really blew the doors open for Metallica. Metallica would continue to further their musical exploration in the 90's, releasing two albums of original material titled Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997), a covers album which featured a few songs one would not expect to hear from Metallica, called Garage Inc. (1998) and a live album that saw Metallica collaborate with conductor Michael Kamen and the San Francisco orchestra called S&M (1999). The great thing about Metallica was that they were and still are constantly growing and evolving. They stayed pretty conservative in regards to heavy metal throughout the duration of the 80's; keeping their evolution quite subtle. Once Enter Sandman was released in July 1991; the band knew there was no going back and kept looking to the future. In 1990, the group found themselves at a crossroad in their life. Judging from their peers in the metal community at the time; it is safe to say that they took a huge risk and ultimately, Metallica took the road that was less traveled by in their community.\n",
        "\nNo, Matt! What the fuck are you doing? Why are you reviewing a Metallica album and more importantly, why isn't it \"Kill 'Em All\", \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Master of Puppets\", or \"...And Justice For All\"? Well, honestly, I am asking myself that very same question. Those four aforementioned albums are definitely when Metallica was at their best, and beginning with \"Metallica\", they would start down a road to superstardom and would go on to become the most famous (as well as infamous) heavy metal band on the planet. When this album came out 7 years ago, I was still beginning my journey with heavy metal. \"Metallica\", also known as \"The Black Album\", was the first album I heard by these guys and while now I don't really like it that much (although I still throw on some of the songs from that album), it still holds a place in my heart. As much as I may not like to admit it. \"Death Magnetic\" was actually the second album from Metallica I heard and I noticed how much faster and more aggressive this album was than their 1991 eponymous release. After visiting the band's 1980s catalogue, it's easy to hear a lot of similarities within the music. This is, in fact, a modern attempt at a classic thrash metal album.\n\nWhen I ask a lot of people what they think of this album, I am met with two answers: 1. \"It's awesome! Sounds like a throwback to their thrash sound of old!\" and 2. \"It sucks.\" The people that answer with the latter response usually say something along the lines of \"the production is terrible and it just sucks\". Everyone is certainly entitled to their own opinions, sure, but I hardly ever get any logical responses from the \"it sucks\" people. Musically speaking, this is a cross between the lengthy and technical \"...And Justice for All\" and the band's launch into mainstream success, \"Metallica\". The songs range between 5 and nearly 10 minutes in length but still retain very radio-friendly sounding sections. This makes for an album that could be described, like \"AJFA\", as progressive thrash metal, but can also be played on a radio station and not sound completely out of place. There is a lot of variation going on here. \"My Apocalypse\" is probably the closest to pure thrash metal as well as being the album's shortest song. In contrast with that, \"The Unforgiven III\" is a much slower song, and \"The Day That Never Comes\" sounds like the band's attempt at recreating their iconic classic \"One\".\n\nAn issue a lot of people commonly voice when expressing their opinions of this album is the static-sounding production. I have no idea why this happened but it is a little distracting. I've listened to plenty of music with awful production and I even enjoy a raw sounding album, but this isn't the same concept. I wouldn't exactly call this raw. It sounds very loud and over-the-top but at the sacrifice of the bass. It's not as bad as \"St. Anger\" was but at the same time, it's not a crisp, clean sound that Metallica had pretty much always been known for. The guitars boast a largely static sound. It sounds fairly unrefined and unfinished. That being said, I've heard much worse. The actual guitar playing on this album is solid and enjoyable and even with the band members all getting \"up there\" in terms of age, there is still a whole lot of energy here. It's not as fast as \"Kill 'Em All\" was and really, we shouldn't even be expecting that at this point. This band can still thrash and that's exactly what they've done here. The solos are back from their extremely controversial absence in \"St. Anger\" and a lot of people were relieved with that upon this album's release. They are not the best solos the band has performed and really, I don't find them super enjoyable. Sure, they're a nice addition and add a little to the structure of the songs during the album's near 75-minute runtime, making the album's length more justifiable than \"St. Anger\" was, but they don't live up to the Metallica solos of old. That being said, they're still better than any solos from the band's self-titled album, except maybe \"The Unforgiven\" and \"Nothing Else Matters\". They just sound forced and improvised, though not exactly in a good way. The song containing the best guitar work for me is the near 10-minute instrumental \"Suicide & Redemption\". It is a throwback to what I consider Metallica's \"big three\" instrumentals: \"The Call of Ktulu\", \"Orion\", and \"To Live Is to Die\". It's the longest song on the album as well as the band's longest song up to this point. The solos as well as riffs are just amazing and definitely noteworthy moments.\n\nLars still has to be one of the most overrated drummers in the entire industry. I just don't see any real redeeming qualities from this dude. Even back in the day, he was just decent and supported the music but nothing more. His playing on this album is probably better than anything he's done in the last 17 years, but why certain people consider him one of the \"best drummers of all time\" is certainly beyond me. It has nothing to do with him being an asshole, either. I just don't see what's so special about the guy. Regardless, his playing here is tight and focused, as well as being the \"thrashiest\" he's done in a good minute, but he is aging and that's fairly noticeable. \n\nThis album could definitely be described as \"...And Justice for All, Part II\" in a few ways. Like I said earlier, the songs are extremely long once again and contain that same element of progressive metal we heard on AJFA. The bass is also almost non-existent here which really, I've never been too bothered by. I like a little bass in my music but I won't bitch and moan if it's not there. I feel like this album could have benefited quite a bit from more bass. This is likely due to the iffy production value (thanks, Rick Rubin, you fuckface!). I'm not sure if the band's intention was to make an album that followed the AJFA structure so closely but they certainly succeeded in doing just that. \n\nAn album that could only be described as a modern classic of thrash metal, \"Death Magnetic\" is a big \"eff you\" to those who doubted this band after their 1990s \"sell-out\" albums and the appalling garage metal abomination that was \"St. Anger\" in 2003. The band is currently in the process of making the follow up to this album, due out next year or early 2017. Hopefully it continues down this path. I must say this is definitely the loudest album Metallica ever made although it is still flawed. Only time will tell if Metallica can become a truly noteworthy thrash metal band once again, but they're certainly on the right path.\n",
        "\nI don't want to talk about Metallica, I don't want to talk about MTV, I don't want to talk about legacy. Nor money, nor Napster, nor thrash, nor haircuts, nor selling out. I want to talk about this album and the music on it, which was supposedly the point of releasing an album with a practically plain cover. And the truth is, this isn't great music. Sure, there are some catchy songs that almost everyone has heard, but they aren't really anything special and some of them are annoying. Even ignoring Metallica's previous albums, this is lowest common denominator heavy metal.\n\nThe style of music on 'Metallica' is mid-paced, stomping hard rock/heavy metal, with strong clean vocals that rarely lose their edge of harshness. Emphasis is placed equally on rhythms and guitar riffs, the production giving the drums and vocals a greater presence than the string instruments. As has become recognizable from a producer like Bob Rock, this production is slightly flat and lacking in energy and depth, leaving the sound somewhat thin and unsubtle, many of the levels pushed up too high or too low. The style and production both sound like a product of their time in 2015, as if the album were recorded cheaply (which was not the case), or according to the standards of a different era (which is certainly true). This kind of sound was ideal for bands looking to play stadiums in the late 80s and early 90s, since the powerful drum sound and strong vocals allow the songs to produce a simple physical response, as the listener can imitate the beat and sing along. As such, 'Metallica' is an album that aims for the mainstream, not for any niche group of fans.\n\nThough the sound is fairly uniform throughout the album, there is variety in the songwriting to appeal to different groups and different moods. The two songs that lead off the album, 'Enter Sandman' and 'Sad But True', both make use of simple yet insistent riffs that are equally suitable for headbanging or dancing, opting for a loud groove approach that relies on repetition, familiarity, and catchiness to generate excitement. Of these two, 'Enter Sandman' is the more successful, since it includes more thoughtful and anthemic lyrics, while 'Sad But True' struggles to rise above that lowest common denominator tag, staying at its slow, stomping pace for too long and ending up a ponderous rocker that spends too much time on the same dull riff. This is the most common style on 'Metallica' and sometimes hits the mark, but often has little appeal beyond the first couple of listens. 'Holier than Thou', 'Through the Never', and to a certain extent 'The Struggle Within' opt for a faster pace, though do little more than reference the band's thrash roots, actually occupying more of the same ground as some of Overkill's 90s work, which grooved strongly without always dropping the pace. The style here is still catchy, though less focused on mainstream or stadium audiences, even if the songs are unlikely to alienate those who enjoyed the opening songs on the album. None of them are thoroughly satisfying, but the added energy and some fluid soloing from Kirk Hammett make them welcome additions to a slow-paced album. Finally, there are the ballads 'The Unforgiven' and 'Nothing Else Matters', both of which also offer a welcome change of pace. 'The Unforgiven' has a memorable lilting acoustic guitar line and a strong emotional climax, while 'Nothing Else Matters' seems diluted and generic in comparison - a \"couples song\" if there ever was one.\n\nDespite these shifts in approach, all of the songs suffer from a common problem. They are, almost without exception, overlong and every song contains some part (be it riffs, vocals, rhythms, or subject matter) that is uninteresting or annoying, resulting in constant frustration or loss of interest while listening. For a mainstream album, the excessive running time and surplus of songs is troublesome, because the catchiness of individual riffs and choruses is sabotaged by the senselessly long introductions and over-simplistic instrumental passages, which would have been better if they had been more fully developed or cut out entirely. The ballads are both much too long for their content, while 'Sad But True' includes around a minute of focus on the main riff, which in the first place is terrible, but is also used for both verse and chorus with little variation. A set of 9 or 10 thoughtfully composed songs or 12 shorter, more focused songs totalling around 45-50 minutes would have been a more appropriate target for this sort of music, bearing in mind the playing style, pace, and intention of the album. However, individual songs also seem to be filler, such as the dull 'Don't Tread on Me', the ultimately forgettable 'Of Wolf and Man', and a few other directionless songs. The largest criticism must be that some songs forsake musical content for catchiness ('Sad But True', 'Don't Tread on Me', 'Nothing Else Matters'), meaning that 'Wherever I May Roam', 'Enter Sandman', and the disorganized but ultimately diverting 'My Friend of Misery' end up the highlights due to some degree of progression taking place in the course of their length, beyond merely a passage from verse to chorus and back again.\n\nIt would be difficult to recommend 'Metallica' to metal fans, though there is surely some material that might appeal, such as the confidently striding 'Wherever I May Roam' and some of Hammett's flashy lead work. The intended audience is clearly much wider and there are many moments that remain memorable despite the bloated scale of the album, yet based on musical quality alone, 'Metallica' has little to offer, whatever context it is considered in.\n",
        "\nNot for the first time in the genre's uncertain history, like the turn of any decade after it's birth, metal was on the ropes. However, only being a decade old, this was the first time in which the genre's existence was in jeopardy. And it was at the hands of drag acts making a mockery of the genre. These were primarily from LA coming left and right in an all out musical parody of any original aspects of the metal genre that were put on the map in the seventies by the likes of Motorhead, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden etc. (bands that each provided their own various ingredients to make influence for what would be Metallica's debut album). \n\nThere were many bands in the same musically aggressive vein of Metallica, even from the same location in the States, who were out to disarm the glam/hair \"metal\" scene and wipe it off the map.. And this album was the first real blow to the glam scene, and the catalyst that would fuel an army of bands who would eventually develop the thrash metal tag that would contribute greatly to the death of anything glam-related. However, unlike nearly all of the rest of those bands who joined Metallica in glorious musical battle against these drag clowns giving the genre a bad name, Metallica were the first to go the full mile and actually record a studio album and drop the first nuke on glam country, instead of firing demo missiles left and right, which bands like Exodus were guilty of. \n\nThis album was everything that rock and metal record labels in the States at the time were out to kill, as if the image wasn't anti-glam enough, this album revives all the musical elements of the British approach to metal at the time, but better yet adds even more elements of aggression. One of the first albums to really revive the elements of the fast-dissolving NWOBHM, what what with melodic, but nonetheless ruthless guitar solos, with the prototypical crunchy riffs of the time that Hetfield would be responsible for, namely the intro riff of \"No Remorse\" and everything happening guitar-wise in \"Seek & Destroy\". \n\nIt's safe to say that Metallica's at the time, new lead guitarist, Kirk Hammett was in his prime with this album. His solos from back to front are simply mind-blowing. A shining example of the sheer unpredictability he was capable of would have to be situated in the underrated guitar solo from \"Seek & Destroy\", to the point of which at the time, I believe would have even given former Metallica lead guitarist, Dave Mustaine a run for his money. This solo is accompanied by very \"in-your-face\" rhythm work by Hetfield, making it hard for any metal fan to at least not rock intensely to. \n\nMustaine has been mysteriously credited by a majority for decades, as the sole innovator for this album's concept, although if you listen to the early demos and then compare to the official release, it's no secret that the solos that Kirk fixed were his own, and it times even shared little to no similarities to what Dave was responsible for. \n\nBesides Kirk, one musician who also contributed greatly to his legendary legacy with this album, was undoubtedly the late bassist, Cliff Burton. This is for no other reason than his showcasing of insane abilities on his solo track, \"Anaesthesia\" to the almost \"tuba-like\" bass tone that can be heard thunderously in tracks like \"No Remorse\". \n\nThe final titan of this 10-song gauntlet is a lyrical and instrumental representation of Metallica's overall despair towards any radio or record label that claimed to specialize in metal music. A track, that any record companies persuaded to take on this band were forced to send their ears to run. The song, \"Metal Militia\". Lyrically, this is a track that simply voices the band's disgust at basically anything happening in the rock and metal scene at the time in the States, in comparison to what was happening in the same scene elsewhere. Any mainstream rock or metal record label at the time would have been undoubtedly seen as a threat to the current trend, and rejected them without second though. Instrumentally this is what would be the third tremolo assault of the album, along with \"Whiplash\" and \"Hit the Lights\". \n\nDespite my adoration for this album, with it arguably being the album that would get generations hooked on Metallica, in all honesty it gets off to a rather slow start. The main riff of \"Hit the Lights\" being almost overly-influential in the sense that it would become the prototypical formula for an endless pile of generic thrash bands from all corners of the globe, decade regardless that would even replicate the exact main riff in a desperate attempt to be \"The next Metallica\". In comparison to pretty much any other track on this album, (including the almost ballad-like \"Jump in the Fire\" with it's uncharacteristically catchy riffs) the main riff to this song is admittedly rather weak. This is one of the songs on this album, probably along with \"Motorbreath\" where the band's punk influence leaks into the riffage, however it's brief tameness is made up for, what with the many solos Kirk once again adds to this, adding more appeal to a metal audience. \n\nFavourite tracks: Whiplash, Phantom Lord, No Remorse, Seek & Destroy, Metal Militia.\n",
        "\nMetallica gave us their incredible debut Kill \u2018Em All in 1983 and a year later they decide to satisfy us with this magnificent Ride the Lightning. We are in front of a much mature and worked album and technically and musically this album is superior to Kill \u2018Em All. It contains less tracks but with more length, being very elaborated, technical and heavy songs and with beautiful and complex melodic clean parts as the intro of Fight Fire with Fire or the amazing instrumental The Call Of Ktulu that begins with a clean guitar intro written by Dave Mustaine.\n\nIn the lineup we have the same members as in the debut record. It should be noted that the production of the album is much better, the guitars are much more powerful and the sound in general is darker and that can be appreciated in Fight Fire with Fire, which starts with a sinister melody of clean guitars that fall into a crazy riff at full speed; in this song I must emphasize the incredible work done by Hetfield on the rhythm guitar, it's simply magnificent just like Lars, who's leaving us breathless through pure speed and good use of double bass as happens in the thundering Trapped Under Ice. Listening to Fight Fire with Fire is like entering the true depths of Hell, a great track. For Whom the Bells Tolls is another dark and slow song and one of my favorites tracks of the album and the whole band, perhaps because it is one of the first tracks I heard by Metallica and because of that I have so much affection for it, it has no guitar solo but seriously I don\u2019t think it need it. \n\nAll the tracks are true immortal classics of the band, specially Creeping Death, one of their best and most famous tracks, with excellent lyrics, incredible and unforgettable chorus and that part at the middle of the song perfect for screaming all together: \u201cDie! Die! Die\u201d. The solo is also great because it starts slowly and then it accelerates and it is very catchy and melodic and frankly one of the best solos by Kirk Hammett, he was at its best and most inspired moment, when he wasn\u2019t still possessed by wah-wah. The other classic is Ride the Lightning, which is a slower track with a fabulous solo. After thirty years these songs are still sounding on their live concerts and that's a lot. \n\nI also emphasize the lyrics which cover deeper themes such as suicide in Fade to Black, death in Ride the Lightning, the war in For Whom the Bell Tolls or even the plagues of Egypt in Creeping Death and not so simple and infantile themes as it happened on their previous record. Sincerely, the album has everything: melody, aggression, technique and their first ballad but, do they know how to make ballads? Sure, they do it incredibly well and it's called Fade to Black. It's a fantastic song with some amazing melodic parts and very good guitar solos. We also found a very good vocal performance by Hetfield who's using a clean, soft and sweet voice... Many people say that Escape is the weakest song of the album but I don't think so because it don\u2019t have weak songs, it has very good lyrics and a very melodic and catchy chorus.\n\nTo conclude I must say it is a mandatory hearing album for those who haven\u2019t heard it yet. If you like technical, melodic and aggressive thrash metal at the same time this is a very good choice. A perfect and unique album but best of all is that here did not end all because Metallica still had much more things to give us.\n",
        "\nThanks to this album and the subsequent Show No Mercy by Slayer, released in the same year, basically they forged what is now known as thrash metal, a fast and aggressive genre. Influenced by the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal and punk bands, Lars Ulrich decides to create with James Hetfield his own band. After several lineup changes that you surely know, Metallica finally reaches his definitive lineup, an unstoppable quartet with which they would raze the world. After some demos, they finally released their first album. The album spotlights for the speed of the songs, we have to keep in mind that at that time there weren\u2019t almost any bands that played like that, and the best thing is that, despite that speed, all the tracks maintain a lot of melody and they are very catchy, by that I mean the riffs, the choruses, the guitar solos and even that strange bass solo by Cliff called Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth).\n\nIt starts with Hit the Lights, a thrash anthem, it has one of my favorites guitar riffs and awesome solos by Hammett. Whiplash is one of my favorites tracks, a very heavy song with a lot of power, and Metal Militia is the angriest and rawest song, the pace of that guitar gallop is just maddening, both of them are real gems of pure speed and aggression. However, we also have slower tracks like Jump in the Fire, which has a very catchy and funny riff written by Mustaine, or the famous Seek & Destroy with that unforgettable riff and chorus, but anyway they don\u2019t lose the aggressiveness. Motorbreath and Phantom Lord remind me a lot of heavy/speed metal bands from the 80's, with very good riffs, even that melodic/clean part from Phantom Lord is great.\n\nRegarding the production, I personally like it very much, a perfectly audible bass and aggressive and dirty guitars just like Hetfield\u2019s voice. Perhaps the drums are the weak point of the production, the drum bass is sometimes difficult to hear, but still it was pretty decent. The album has no ballad as happens in the the following Metallica records, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary here because the album flows incredibly well because of the combination of aggression and melody which I talked of before. You don\u2019t get bored while you're listening to the album, it\u2019s not monotonous, the songs are very original and worked. They are made with desire to destroy your ears, as Hetfield says: \u201cWith all our screaming, we\u2019re gonna rip right through your brain, we got the lethal power, it\u2019s causing you sweet pain\u201d.\n\nI love Kirk Hammett\u2019s solos on this record, very fast and catchy, you just need to hear the solo at the beginning of No Remorse, another great track with one of the best choruses of the album, or the final solo from Hit the Lights. Lars also did a great job on this record, I don't think he's a bad drummer, he just need to practice more today. I have to say that this record wouldn\u2019t have been the same without all Mustaine\u2019s contributions, because he wrote many awesome riffs and even the amazing song, The Four Horsemen, but under the name, The Mechanix. Maybe the lyrics aren't very good in some songs and a little bit immature in some cases, but some of them are pretty good, as for example, Jump in the Fire, it talks about how the devil realizes that the world it's becoming the real hell because of all the wars and murders, and all of us will jump in the hell's fire.\n\nIn short, an essential record from Metallica\u2019s best era, I can't really highlight nothing, because I like all of it, it's perfect. It's an album that has become a thrash classic and created one of the best metal sub-genres. Many people probably don\u2019t think like me, but we must always remember this wonderful debut, because without it, metal in general wouldn\u2019t be the same.\n",
        "\nThis album is not just the worst Metallica album ever made, nor is it merely the worst heavy metal album ever made...I go so far as to call it the biggest disgrace in the history of music. You can forget all the good things Metallica did prior to this, and simply judge it on its face value alone. It is musically speaking, then, the most horrendous release of music the world has ever seen. No exaggeration. \n\nWhat the hell were they thinking to make Lou Reed the lead vocalist? This guy can't sing one fucking note in tune, and every time he opens his mouth he sounds like a beat up, decrepit, senile, old rambling idiot. The lyrics are equally as atrocious as the vocals themselves. \"I would cut my legs and tits off when I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski in the dark of the moon\"...What the hell? I don't even know how to begin interpreting such bizarre conceptions of the human imagination. But far worse than reading these shitty lyrics is hearing them being spouted in such an annoying fashion, throughout the entire album, making you want to put a bullet to your head just to put an end to the ordeal. \n\nThe songs are dreadfully long and certain parts are obnoxiously drawn out and repetitive, which would be funny if they weren't actually attempting to make what they perceive as \"experimental metal\" or \"art rock\". If this can be called artistic expression, then you as well call anything and everything artistic expression. There's this continuous, annoying sound of a country guitar twang that keeps repeating at the start of every phrase. Yes, the overall idea of mixing a Lou Reed country style of playing with metal music results in a complete failure of any good riffs whatsoever. Lars' drumming sucks even worse than ever, requiring no skill or talent at all, and being slowed down to depressing pace. I don't hear any good or complex fills either; just a ton of crashes on the symbols, and overly repetitive and dull. You won't find any guitar solos on this album either, and as such Kirk Hammett's performance on the album seems to be totally forgettable. When he does play, he plays with no passion or seriousness whatsoever. \n\nNothing heard on this album takes the slightest amount of musical skill to pull off. There are no challenging or difficult sections throughout the entire album. Everything you hear is slow, boring, depressing, and empty. There are so many low points on a musical level, that it's really hard to pick a worst one. All of it is a disgrace on both a musical and an artistic level. The album is 1 hour and 17 minutes in length, but the amount of actual musical ideas might amount to a mere 25 minutes or less. There are many sections which simply repeat for an obnoxiously long duration, such as the entire latter half of the song \"Mistress Dread\". Amazingly, the production and sound quality of the instruments are just as horrendous as the musical skill. Yes, I say it's amazing, considering that Metallica has millions of dollars to spend on studio time and recording quality, yet they purposely try to record with low-tech mixing and production. Nearly every other metal band in the world could put their equipment to some good use, and easily make a better sounding album with minimum effort.\n\nLulu really is a joke of an album, and by far the worst idea in Metallica's career. I can't say enough about how much Lou Reed sucks, and how much he brings the rest of the band down with him. The album is centered around Reed's pathetic songwriting and vocals, which are even more empty and devoid of life than the abomination that was St. Anger.\n",
        "\nMetallica's work since the Black Album has been mercilessly scrutinised in my opinion, and sometimes this has been rather unfair. Load is certainly a departure from previous albums, but what is wrong with a little change?\n\nIt is obvious fairly quickly that the thrash elements of the band's music in the 1980s are not present, but I think that Load is a good album, and Metallica were adventurous in trying something different. The songs are slower and generally shorter than those on, say, Master of Puppets. Load starts off well, its first track having a fast tempo that is a brief reminder of Metallica's older material, and \u201cUntil It Sleeps\u201d has a creepy, sinister sound that keeps the listener engaged, and is easily one of the best tracks on the album.\n\nHowever, by the middle of the album some of the riffs become fairly forgettable and \u201cBleeding Me\u201d plods on for too long in my view. Generally, the guitar solos on Load are not as distinctive as those of classic Metallica songs such as \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d and \u201cOne\u201d, which is a shame because a lot of the tracks on Load have solid riffs that make the songs good on their own, the chorus of \u201cThorn Within\u201d being an excellent example. James Hetfield is on fine form, with tuneful vocals in a similar vein to those on 1991's Metallica. \n\nLoad is quite dark in its tone, and the guitars dropped down by a half step certainly contribute to this. Some of the slowed down songs can be as menacing as the faster, thrashier ones of old, showing that speed isn't necessarily everything to make a decent Metallica song. Clean guitar sounds are sometimes used, for example in \u201cBleeding Me\u201d, which adds some variety to the music that again makes Load a bit different to other Metallica works, as before Load the vast majority of songs involved heavily distorted guitars with little else. One could even argue that several different musical styles are used on Load: metal is present throughout, but some songs are less heavy and could be regarded as hard rock, and \u201cMama Said\u201d even sounds like country music, which is practically foreign territory for Metallica based on their back catalogue. \n\nThe album improves towards the end, but at fourteen tracks long I feel that Load could be truncated and made even better, while some fans would argue that the best songs on Load and ReLoad could have been stitched together to make one very solid album. I still maintain that most of Load is very good and that it has had a harsh treatment. It's well worth a listen, though it isn't quite the same standard as Metallica's classic thrash in the '80s glory days.\n",
        "\nThis is the 5th and final single from Metallica's infamous eponymous 1991 album. Much like most physical singles, the B-side is a rarity (or was, at the time). However, unlike most singles, the B-side is actually the superior song. Releases like this are generally pretty pointless, but the score only takes into account\n\nThe single's title track is the second from its parent album. It is one of the grooviest songs on the album, and here in lies its issue. It is very stagnant and dull, much like most radio groove would be. The guitars are of a D standard tuning, as in, lower than usual. That is never a good sign; lower tunings generally mean compensation for a lack of actual aggression and the heaviness that generally ensues. And indeed, that is what happened here. The same groove is repeated for almost the entire song, an excruciating five and a half minutes. Lars Ulrich was never the greatest drummer, but this is just appalling. It isn't off-kilter like his work on the later Load, but man he uses the exact same straight drumbeats for, wait for it, almost the entire song. This song just repeats itself entirely, and randomly stops before the nice enough, but not terribly advanced solo. I will give this song some credit though- though Hetfield isn't as aggressive and biting in his vocal delivery as he was on ...And Justice For All, he still maintains some power in his pipes. He also managed to pen a very catchy chorus, hence why this was used as a single.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the B-side to this single is a far better song. It is a cover of the Anti-Nowhere League's 'So What?'. It is a hardcore punk song that has been metallised to become a thrasher. Why this wasn't featured on the parent album (other than as a Japanese bonus track) is beyond me. Lyrically, it is quite profane, dealing with the band's frustration at those who boast about doing outrageous things to seem tough. The song features several ballsy riffs, and though the drum work is basic, it at least manages to remain energetic. Hetfield puts on a far sharper vocal performance, and does these hateful and vulgar lyrics justice. Some reckon it was this song that caused him to wreck his voice right in time for Load.\n\nSo what we have here is a really, really dull groove metal track with a simple and catchy chorus that made it big on the radio. This song is essentially the prototype for Pantera's 'Walk', but with far better vocals and an inferior solo. The excellent B-side is a nice slab of thrash when the genre was beginning to die out, and should be featured on all versions of Metallica. But both of these songs can be found elsewhere. The A-side can be found on the aforementioned album, and the B-side can be found as a bonus track on Japanese pressings or on Garage Inc.. I would say get the former and the latter, as they offer more material (without overlap) and are easier to come by.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m sure some of you are asking \u201cWhy review St. Anger out of all the Metallica albums?\u201d It\u2019s a controversial, unique album surrounded by stigma that isn\u2019t as bad as you think. In fact, this album has some good moments despite the obvious flaws. Out of the blue, a co-worker of mine let me borrow this album and it brought back memories of how much I enjoyed songs from this as a teenager. Those songs, Frantic and St. Anger, are still just as good now as they were back then. That said, this is not the Metallica you grew up with from the 1980\u2019s. I\u2019m pretty sure a couple of these songs made it to rock radio, something a song like \u201cHit The Lights\u201d would never do. Despite the simple approach, there\u2019s more good than bad on this release.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t come up with a better name than St. Anger for this album. It has an angry, angst filled atmosphere on the gritty side of things. The songs \u201cShoot Me Again\u201d and \u201cThe Unnamed Feeling\u201d are perfect examples of this. Speaking of which, the songs are all generally good, with a couple just not living up to the rest. Some of the songs are catchy, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. \u201cInvisible Kid\u201d has catchy lyrics with memorable guitar riffs to complement it. The guitar riffs on different songs do sound similar, but the best tracks stand out. Get ready for a steady dose of influences from the nu metal, hard rock, and groove metal subgenres on St. Anger. Though there are still remains of the thrashy roots here. There are gallops throughout, and the chord strummed chorus on the song \u201cSt. Anger\u201d wouldn\u2019t be out of place on \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d. The vocals sound fine and add to the tough atmosphere. The music is downright simple at times, but the album flows together well as a unit. Despite the positives, there are legitimate reasons why this album is stigmatized.\n\nSt. Anger has a few problems that stand out. The songs are way too long, and the repetitive riffs you heard the first minute add nothing to the sixth or seventh minute. The riffs are simple and become repetitive in just about every song. The 75 minute time span could\u2019ve been scaled back to 40 minutes. I can\u2019t say enough about how bad the drums are. The sound could be a lot better and the drum rhythms are virtually the same on every song. There are no guitar solos on this album. Metallica has made some of the best solos in music history, and yet this release doesn\u2019t contain any lead guitar work. This fact points to the mainstream rock direction Metallica\u2019s been attempting for a while. This clearly is not the album you\u2019ll listen to for months on end. In the end, the strong moments do make for some rocking music.\n\nSt. Anger is a hard-hitting album that seems to lack something. It has good riffs throughout, but you get the feeling with a couple changes, this album could\u2019ve been so much better. Some songs like \u201cSweet Amber\u201d are genuinely good songs. And then we hear the ultra repetitive tracks past the six minute mark. St. Anger represents the troubled time of the band Metallica, and the end result brought out some good aggressive music. This album\u2019s bright spots do slightly outweigh the bad in the end. 60/100\n",
        "\nHere we go... \"St. Anger\" by Metallica. Well, let's start with the fact that Metallica is one of the most legendary heavy metal band of all times for various reasons, no doubt about it. While being one of the pioneers of thrash metal and leaders of the entire movement in the 1980s, they also have managed to make many of the non metal listeners also curious about the genre. I'd even say they are one of the main bands which people tend to get into at first and eventually may become metal fans. This is mainly due to the \"Black Album\" which, while not being Metallica's best release musically, possesses many well known anthems. Then of course the band has come out with amazing \"Kill em'all\", legendary \"Ride the Lightning\" and \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Justice\" album isn't bad too. There is a lot to praise Metallica for. Then again, there are way more bands which overall have much stronger discography to show for and releasing something as terrible as \"St. Anger\" happened to be is quite rare also, at least by this well established bands.\n\nLars and James, the two leading members, didn't get along with each other at the time St. Anger was supposed to be recorded. Also their bassist Jason Newsted had enough and decided to leave Metallica. Bass was played by the producer Bob Rock. In that kind of environment things were bound to go wrong and they did - big time. Starting off from questionable album cover to the absurdly bad production, there is very little good on this album.\n\nThe lyrics of Metallica had become personal from the self titled release already, but were kicked up a notch here. You can mostly hear about James battling his inner demons, which was alcoholism problem at the time. Vocal effort by him is somewhat annoying and often too forced, but not the biggest issue of this album. But when it comes to instrumental part.... while it mostly sounds like hard rock or even stoner rock, riffing is so dull and uninspired. It feels like a random garage rehearsal, has no backbone and lacks of proper structure. It is, however, catchy at times and some songs have a little potential but another completely bland riffing part then comes up which kills it all. This leads us to the problem that this album feels as disjointed as possible. Really not something that you'd expect to hear from one of the biggest metal band in the world. What about the guitar solos? Oh yeah, there are none! \n\nThen ridiculous drumming by no one else than Lars Ulrich. While even many of the hardcore Metallica fans would agree that Lars is nowhere near an excellent drummer, he has been decent on some of the early releases, most prominently on \"And Justice for All...\". But here, drumming is the worst aspect of this release. Not only is playing as amateurish as it was on otherwise superb \"Kill em'all\", but also drum sound is god awful and way too high in the mix. Snare sounds like hitting hollow barrels. Even cymbals sound incredibly annoying for most of the time. Yeah, Lars even uses double bass at times, but his generic style literally suffocates this album. There are no surprises, just one linear line of boredom.\n\nAnd this leads us to the production, that is simply atrocious. The main problem is of course completely screwed up drum sound (That's probably what Lars wished though), but guitar sound is nothing good either - it just lacks the punch needed at times. On the other hand, guitar sound could be much more precise and cleaner. That's not always needed, but considering everything, it wouldn't hurt. And there's no reason to comment bass guitar too, it's inaudible and played by Bob Rock, so who cares. Vocal mix isn't all terrible, but as said, could be much well performed. \n\n\"St. Anger\" is one of the biggest missteps by one of the metal superstars. Even much bashed \"Illud Divinum Insanus\" by Morbid Angel, Cryptopsy's deathcore album or Megadeth's \"Risk\" had a clearer vision of what these albums were supposed to be. Generally these are all experiments which did go horribly wrong, while I personally don't think Cryptopsy's \"Unspoken King\" was all that bad. Nevertheless \"St. Anger\" had much blurrier identity than these three. It's poorly written, dreadfully produced and doesn't feel like a whole. Instead, it consists of pretty random and generally poor and repetitive riffing, alongside which we can hear even worse drumming. You can feel that the entire record is too forced and none of the members were actually into the recording process. Maybe few years later things would have worked out a little better. Somehow Metallica was able to put out an even worse piece of crap called \"Lulu\" feat. Lou Reed, but that still is no salvation to \"St. Anger\". \n\nThe bottom line is that Metallica has put out some great records in the past and for that they shall always be hailed. \"St. Anger\" or \"Lulu\" can't erase the classic Metallica releases. However, it is a shame that Metallica has put out very little stunning since \"And Justice for All...\" Even though it is largely subjective, I'd suggest for newer Metallica listeners to skip this album for good and check out some of the stuff from the 80's, the black album or even \"Death Magnetic\". There are many people who claim that they like \"St. Anger\" and that's fine, but this reviewer just can't find any appeal to it.\n\n6/100\n",
        "\nBands usually suck when they start out. I know, debuts and sophomore efforts are usually among the favorites, but I mean before the first album is written. Here\u2019s an example: my favorite non-metal band wrote about fifty songs before they recorded their first album. Even I think that the earliest ones suck.\n\nMetallica is an exception to this rule. All of the songs from their first demo made it onto Kill Em All, and this stuff is pretty solid. The riffs are memorable and the solos excellent, the songs are fast and furious; everyone performs well, even Lars. His drumbeats are the typical generic patterns, but he works in some cool fills here and there. You can identify the album just by James\u2019 voice. It has more of a shriek to it, but it\u2019s well-suited to the music. I can actually hear the bass, and I\u2019m not talking about just Anesthesia, I mean most of the album. There isn\u2019t a decrease in quality over time, though you have standout songs. The album length (51 minutes) is just right for the amount of variation heard, and the song lengths themselves are short, the longest song only at seven minutes and Motorbreath at the shortest in their whole discography (barely three minutes). I wish they\u2019d used this idea of shorter songs their whole career. There\u2019s less experimentation with structure than in any of their other eighties works, but Kill Em All doesn\u2019t need that. Its influences are obvious, and if you listen to it, it\u2019s easy to tell that they were listening to lots of NWOBHM and punk when they wrote it. It literally defines thrash metal in a way that Metallica\u2019s other albums don\u2019t. As they went on, they became less and less thrashy, with this album the only pure thrash they\u2019ve put out. Master of Puppets has about two complete thrash songs on it, and this is being generous because each of them have specifically non-thrash intros (Battery and Damage Inc). \u2026And Justice For All should not be considered thrash at all, except for Dyers Eve.\n\nAnyway, you\u2019re here to read about Kill Em All, not the gradual stylistic shift of Metallica\u2019s music throughout the eighties. I\u2019ve just sung its praises for one really long paragraph, but there\u2019s one thing I hate about this album. It\u2019s the lyrics. Here are some examples: \u201cWe are gonna kick some ass tonight,\u201d \u201cleather and metal are our uniforms,\u201d \u201cATTACK!!!!!!\u201d \u201cYou only live once\u201d (James yolo\u2019d before it was cool), and of course, basically all of Whiplash (except the scream at the very end, I love that scream).\n\nHowever, there is no doubt the actual music is very solid thrash. Hit the Lights, despite having the dumbest lyrics I have ever heard (I am tempted to do a dramatic reading of it someday), is a really fun song with crazy soloing, and before you know it, you\u2019re headbanging and punching your lamps. A definite highlight. But think about this: you\u2019re fifty years old and you\u2019re still performing a vanity song you wrote when you were a stupid kid. Honestly I kind of feel bad for them. But that\u2019s their punishment for not releasing a song that their fans have deemed worthy of being played at all of their shows in, say, the second half of their discography, more than twenty years.\n\nThe Four Horsemen is another highlight. Since I was introduced to this version before hearing Mechanix, Megadeth\u2019s recording of this song freaks me out. As much as I hate Kill Em All lyrics, at least James isn\u2019t singing about cars as a metaphor for having sex. (Disclaimer: Megadeth is cool and without Dave KEA would be far different.) It\u2019s also the longest song on the album, at only seven minutes.\n\nJump in the Fire has one of my favorite main riffs, and it is followed by the famous bass solo, Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth). It is arguably the best solo on the album, but it\u2019s more like a novelty to me. No disrespect to Cliff, but it doesn\u2019t seem to fit on the album, not as a single track. It\u2019s strategically placed near the middle of the album, providing a break from the otherwise relentless thrash, but it might have been better if parts of the solo were interspersed throughout the rest of the songs, or if it was only played live, or something else. All it does is give the album some variation and make you think, \u201cOh, cool, a bass solo, you don\u2019t hear those every day.\u201d\n\nPhantom Lord is notable for its mellower bridge, and No Remorse for its pre-chorus riff, which I really enjoy. Cannibal Corpse has a cover of this song, and they do a good job. As for Seek and Destroy, it\u2019s a solid piece, but its catchiness is really the only reason it\u2019s played so often in concert.\n\nOverall, a definite classic of the thrash metal genre and of metal as a whole. It flows well, except for Anesthesia, and for a debut, it\u2019s great. The poor quality of the lyrics and the low level of variation can likely be explained by how it is their first album. Later on, there is more maturity, especially lyrically. They do away with vanity songs, and sing about more grown-up things, like being angry at your parents, turning into a wolf, death, cars, and the monsters under your bed. (But really, this album sounds immature, especially when compared to their later works.) If you\u2019re new to thrash metal, this would be a good place to start.\n",
        "\nOverall this is great, but there certainly are some big questions here, so may as well get them on the table. First off, why the hell does Metallica get their own disc, and all three of the others have to share one? That doesn't seem like it should matter, until you find out that their setlist is way longer than the other bands. I get it, their the big guys, the popular ones, but come on man, they gotta all be even. Another thing, at the end when all four bands were out to play \"Am I Evil?\", why were there hardly any Slayer members out there? Granted, the others came out for the big picture at the end of it. Those are my only questions with the DVD as a whole, but note that for the rest of this, I will break it into one part for each band's performance.\n\nBeing chronological here, I will start with the performance of Anthrax. This one was probably actually my second least favorite of the four bands to play. I love Anthrax, but Joey Belladonna's voice just doesn't seem to do it for my live anymore or at least not as well. If this was made in the year 1989 or something along those lines, it would probably be pretty solid. His voice just seems to be out of range a lot and there's hardly any power there anymore. Thankfully the rest of the band does pretty well, but then again you usually don't lose instrument skills because of age, and that's all this really seems to be from. I like the setlist they picked, all of the songs on here are classics, however I probably would have replaced \"Only\" with something else. John Bush was not made for this band, and Joey singing his songs doesn't change anything. Scott Ian, I will say, seems to play just as well if not better than back in the heyday. Something that is evident in slowing down is \"Got The Time\". That's one of the fastest Anthrax songs that I know, but on here they could not quite keep up the pace anymore. No shame in that, they have had an incredible career and I am glad the boys were able to re-unite to do something like this. To sum it up though, I'd say it's good, but just not the same as what it could have been years ago. Granted I wasn't alive all of those years ago, but you get the point. My total scoring for this one would probably be 67%.\n\nMegadave, I mean, excuse me, Megadeth is next. Anymore the band lineup means nothing to me because it always seems to change. However Nick Menza on drums is the exception. He is the one drummer that is superior to the others. That means nothing since he is not on here. Regardless of that though, this was probably the best performance of the four bands. Dave Mustaine, although getting old and certainly showing age, does a pretty great job on this. His solos and playing techniques did not go down at all since the '80s, and even after his issue with his hand, he still kills it. Same goes for his vocals, if anything, they sound a little quieter, but I wouldn't say weaker. Hardly ever in metal is the bass ever that significant to me, simply because a lot of times I can't even hear it. David Ellefson is an exception, because his playing is very audible and sounds great on almost all of the tracks. Megadeth still has it in them for this performance. I also love how he takes one break in all of the songs. While the other bands stop and talk to the audience, he does that one time very briefly before the track \"Head Crusher\". And that's it! No more do you hear them stop and do anything like that. It just plays straight through til the end, with the Holy Wars Reprise that they seem to end every concert with. They did something similar when I saw Megadeth live in 2013 with Black Label Society, Device, Hellyeah!, and Newsted. Great performace, and overall get's an 89%.\n\nSLAYER! You'll hear that a lot at metal concerts in general. However I can't say at this one I would do the same. I was greatly disappointed by this performance, and would definitely say that this was the worst one. For years Slayer were great live performers, but like Anthrax I think the age is finally getting to them. Other live DVDs of theirs such as \"War At The Warfield\" or \"Live Intrusion\" are spectacular. But this one, definitely is a let down. I'd like to see Slayer soon so I can say I've seen them, before they completely die out. Anyways, Tom Araya has lost all sense of power in his voice. Take \"Angel Of Death\" and \"War Ensemble\". Both of those songs have long, loud, beastly screams. He either doesn't do them or does it very weakly in this. He also doesn't sound like he always has his breath for some parts, and overall just sounds weak. The rest of the band did pretty well, but that isn't enough to balance it out to me. Jeff Hannemen has always been my guitarist of choice for this band. His was pretty up to par, however Kerry King seems to only care about how mean he looks and the playing sounds a little slowed down. Then again, so does the whole band. It's the age, I'm telling you. Something else, I thought that the setlist was rather mediocre. There was too much new stuff and not enough classic. They played nothing from the first two albums, but then again, I'm not sure if they even could at this point. Yet they could do \"Chemical Warfare\", so I don't understand. Also, like I said, almost none of the guys joined at the end for the \"Am I Evil?\" performance. Come on guys, get off your asses and get out there. You're legendary! Slayer certainly went below their standards, and receive a 50%.\n\nLastly, the band absorbing the most fame, Metallica. Their performance was incredible too, almost as good as Megadeth's. Metallica have always seemed to be ageless when it comes to playing live. Sure, they aren't the long haired aggressive maniacs that we all know of and loved in the '80s, but they still certainly aren't bad. The only thing is, I don't really see why they get to play so much more just because they're more popular. Regardless, most of it was pretty good. James still sings his heart out, and gives off that vibe of just wanting to have fun. Lars is still a freak, not the best drummer, but still the same guy he always was. The instruments are top notch as always. Really, there's no disappointments on this. They probably could have cut out some of the newer stuff as well, much like Slayer needed to do. But they make up for it by at least doing everything well and having plenty of classics on here to balance it out. While most people get annoyed by bands that talk a lot, Metallica is fine by doing so. Like I said, James always wants to just put up a good show, so him talking to the audience a lot is not a problem at all. Something else that I never quite understood was why they always throw the tracks from \"Kill 'Em All\" at the very end. They did that here too. Perhaps they just like to close on an energetic note? Hey, at least they did a great job with it, like I said. Certainly nothing like it was but at least they can adapt their old stuff well. I give this one an 88%.\n\nIf you like all of the bands, I suggest getting this regardless of some of the flaws, just because it is something that every fan should see at least ones. It has it's good, bad, and ugly (definitely not talking about some of the band members at all there....). It's also good for background if you have people over and just want a concert on TV. Mostly good performances with some weak parts, that's all I've got to say.\n",
        "\nEven after hearing people saying something along the lines of \"most people don't know it, but this is where it all went wrong for Metallica\" I still find this album a joy to listen to. It may be due to significant exposure to the album ever since the age of 14, but that's exactly what this is to me: an album to LIVE with.\n\nMost music today is made to be consumed in a short-ish sitting, and then after that it's merely labeled \"good\" or \"meh\" or \"actually not that good\", but it is a credit to Metallica that, back in 1986 (and arguably still today) they can craft masterful riffs and songs that still stand the test of time. The now legendary main riff of the title track \"Master Of Puppets\" is a somewhat cliche testament to this. The abundance of such riffs is also astounding. They can be found on every single song. Why? Each riff adds a part to the whole of the song it's in, giving the entire song it's own personality. Damage Inc and Battery are light-hearted thrash-arounds to mosh to, most of the rest of the roster have their own themes as well, such as Lovecraft-ian horrors, the dangers of drugs (and Tipper Gore thought that heavy metal advertised drugs, tsk tsk), and being wrongfully deemed insane. These themes create a very interesting listen, to the individual tracks AND to the entire album, and that is most of the album's significant, timeless draw. That, and the hardline fans calling this Metallica's \"last truly great album.\"\n\nAnd speaking of lyrical themes, the crafting of lyrics is just astounding on this album, almost as if the lyrics and riffs are in perfect, absolute sync with each other. For example: Welcome Home (Sanitarium)'s lyrics are quietened and despondent, totally matching the foreboding riffs crafted around the feel of the song.\n\nSo where does it all fall down? Leper Messiah. Right off of the bat, you can TELL this song was just meant to be throwaway album filler. The riffage in this song just feels flat-out uninspired, and maybe that's the sign of things to come that some crazies point to, but it just feels like it HAS to be there because Master Of Puppets is an 8-track, recording obligations and so on. Reasons? Sounds like they stole that particular idea from the notebook of David Bowie.\n\nAlso, while this is the last album to feature Cliff Burton before his death, I can't say that much about the bass work as well. Sure it's THERE, and incredibly prominent in Orion, which is a testament to his brilliance at being able to play bass and inject feeling into his solos without relying on technical mastery to carry him. Other than that, it's just not particularly prominent in the recordings, and when you can hear the bass, it's nothing remarkable. \n\nBut despite those shortcomings, Master Of Puppets still has a wealth of strengths and highpoints to help it stand tall amongst other, more revolutionary albums out there (yeah, they kinda gained their maturity on Ride The Lightning, this album expands upon it), and in a way, it was sort of the end for Metallica in the making, because now all the fans want is a Master-Of-Puppets 2.0. \"What? St Anger, no! That is a dark stain on their career\" and so on. Nevertheless, great album, recommend highly (except Leper Messiah).\n",
        "\nSo after managing to piss off just about everyone with \"Load\" and \"Reload\" (except me), you would've thought that the final nail in the coffin was the legendary backwards-leap that was \"St Anger\", but Metallica still decided to record a new album - and they decided to stick to their guns and make a thrash album harking back to days of old, when the underground was raving about such songs as \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\", \"Master Of Puppets\" and the like. Well, will fans be raving about this album as well and ranking it with the older albums? Well probably.\n\nObviously I can't account for everyone, but I kinda like the album. Yes folks, it's a return to roots, albeit a fairly middle-of-the-road affair. You would've thought that with a title such as Death Magnetic they would have stuck to the greatness of their former 80s selves, but time is a cruel mistress, especially on James Hetfield's aging voice, and Lars Ulrich's deteriorating ability to drum, and Rick Rubin is a cruel producer. This is an album taking up another shouting match in the loudness war, and the overall quality suffers from it, especially Lars Ulrich's snare. It might have the snares on, but it's still pretty intrusive at times.\n\nThat's not to say the songs are bad, oh no. On the contrary, they're quite good, but only a handful of songs are truly memorable. The album opens frantically enough with the building heartbeat sound that opens \"That Was Just Your Life\", and the album sucks you in. It sucks you in so much that you almost don't notice the filler songs, such as \"Cyanide\", \"The End Of The Line\", \"Suicide and Redemption\" and \"Broken Beat and Scarred\", even though they do contain some pretty good riffs. \n\nThus, when you reach the standout tracks, boy do they stand out! I am, of course, referring to my favourites on the album - \"All Nightmare Long\", \"The Unforgiven III\", \"The Day That Never Comes\", \"My Apocalypse\" and \"The Judas Kiss\"! Memorable riffs galore, infectious balladry (\"The Unforgiven III\" and \"The Day That Never Comes\") and (certainly for Lars) unbridled speed, especially in the closing track \"My Apocalypse\". It's a mix of standout and filler in equal measure, and it's good to see Metallica back to form. Oh, and I don't think that at ANY moment is this album somehow convoluted and not \"honest\". Even the filler. \n\nSo despite shortcomings such as drum work that leaves a bit to be desired and brick-wall-of-sound production, I left this album feeling satisfied. I hope you do too.\n",
        "\nAlthough I love St. Anger nearly in its entirety (\"Sweet Amber\" is awful), this is easily the strongest song on the album. It's one of the few with actual direction (the others being \"Frantic,\" \"The Unnamed Feeling\" and \"My World\"), has an absolutely killer riff, surprisingly decent lyrics, and is composed of pure aggression!\n\nRight away the main riff gets your attention and builds up to a rapid-fire monstrosity dares you NOT to headbang to it. Lars actually remembers what timekeeping is and provides a galloping pace for the track, and it really does sound like some monstrosity is coming to ruin your life. For a song about addiction and the strains of stardom, the song gets its message across without delving into whiny, Axl Rose-tier bitchiness, aconsidering this is from the same band who thought \"Ain't My Bitch\" was a good idea, that's quite an accomplishment.\n\nWhile the extra tracks are excellent, there's not much else to be said other than this coming off as a huge cash grab. And, well, it is, since these songs were also featured on the \"The Unnamed Feeling EP,\" which came out a while before this. All this offers is a badly mutilated single version of SKOM which kills its appeal. Where's the buildup? Why the fuck would you start with the midtempo section of the opening? How the flying fuck did they somehow manage to make this thing 4 minutes long?\n\nThere's not much of a point to this single, and the only benefit of getting it is another piece of Metallica memorabilia for your collection. But if you need a place to start with St. Anger, it's definitely this song. It's big, it's heavy, and it kicks ass.\n",
        "\nThe absolute first thing I notice about Death Magentic is the thrashy riffs that are more reminiscent of Metallica\u2019s yester years. It\u2019s obvious that Metallica tried to tap into their wild, unconventional youth, and the end result is a variety of heavy riffs that wheel in and out of several unique grooves. It\u2019s also refreshing to hear James Hetfield\u2019s vocal performance is as strong as ever, while Lars Ulrich\u2019s frantic drumming is tasteful and very fitting of the music. These are some of the best songs that Metallica have written in decades, and thanks to more the complex and varied structures, any metal fan is sure to find several wicked riffs and head banging sessions during the album\u2019s lengthy runtime. \n\nAnother notable thing about Death Magentic comes courtesy of song lengths. While their previous effort, St. Anger, recycled riffs needlessly, the song lengths of Death Magentic are more justified this time around. The majority of songs on the album are over seven minutes, but all the riffs sound very inspired and the structures are creative enough to hold your attention throughout. My only real problem with the long song lengths is that, while some songs sound more cohesive, some songs just sound like a string of riffs that were thrown together (notably the instrumental track \u201cSuicide and Redemption\u201d). While there really isn\u2019t a bad song on the entire album, some songs just sound more natural than others, and sometimes the feeling of authenticity is lost during certain stretches of some certain songs.\n\nAnd while Death Magentic as a whole is a spectacular, grandiose effort, there are a lot of elements that dampen the quality of the music. First off, I\u2019m glad that Metallica has decided to reintroduce solos back into their sound, but can someone please take that goddamn wah-wah pedal away from Mr. Hammett? While his soloing is par for the course and occasionally surprises me (\u201cThe Day That Never Comes\u201d, \u201cUnforgiven III\u201d), he needs that thing taken away from him. The production, while towering and dominant, sounds a bit too unrefined and the bass guitar is largely buried in the mix. And while the lengthy songs aren\u2019t too cumbersome to listen to individually, listening to this album in one sitting can be very overbearing given the long, long runtime.\n\nSo while Death Magentic doesn\u2019t quite live up to Metallica\u2019s classic material, it is a very impressive effort. In the end, Death Magentic turns out to be very fun, enjoyable listen and the boys in the band sound like they really put their absolute best efforts into it.\n",
        "\nCreeping Death, is without a doubt my favorite Metallica song so expect some fanboy to come out in this review. Also know that the two covers will not be factored into the total score simply so that I can give this song a 100%\n\nCreeping Death starts with a nice dramatic introduction before going into a nice fast riff. The vocals begin with a nice shout, but sort of a melodic shout. The chorus offers a slower more melodic and epic sounding riff. You can even almost sing along to the chorus while you headbang. After the second chorus comes a nice shredding melodic solo that comes into a slower section that can definitely be sung along to, 'die by my hand I creep across the land'. The song manages to be very melodic and still throw in speed riffs amongst other little tricks they hide in their sleeves.\n\nPerformance wise this a tight performance. They keep up with each other flawlessly (even Lars). They spread enough skill throughout the song to keep their fans impressed. Enough melody to appeal to a crowd outside the thrash fanbase. Perfectly showing the balance of legitimate metal credibility and marketability that make them the kings of thrash. They didn't wear the crown for long but they definitely deserved it at the time.\n\nGuitar wise you have some great riffs, the opening riff which is captivating and epic (there's a reason they played it again as an outro), the riff that's played during the chorus is fast and drives it forward. A slow and melodic riff during the chorus. The other guitar will play melodic shred riffs at different points through out the song for emphasis and power, it provides the solo which is also a shredded but melodic. Both guitars come together for an extra emphasized big ending that gives the song one final burst of energy before closing.\n\nSadly the bass keeps pace with the guitars and does some cool stuff of its own but is practically mixed out wasting Cliff Burton's genius. Lars does some good drumwork here, that might be hard for some to believe but his drumming was competent back in the day. Nothing really flashy or attention demanding but he keeps pace and time.\n\nLyrically this song fits the bill just fine, the lyrics basically cover the story of the 10 plagues unleashed upon Egypt in the book of Moses. Not as dark as Slayer but these lyrics were still an anthem of anger, rebellion and everything else metal. James shouting actually could almost pass as singing, kudos on that. He puts a lot of energy into the vocals to make, they sound rough but add to the melody of the song showing a strange versatility.\n\nThe covers of Am I Evil and Blitzkrieg are both tight and well performed, neither quite touches the original but both are worth the listen, managing to fit to Metallica's style and still be quality listens. I really just can't say much about these covers, not quite sure how to stack them up to the originals. James' vocal style works pretty well on both and Am I Evil is actually performed in its entirety showing some unused levels of skill on the part of whichever one did the solo (I believe it was Kirk, but I've never cared to find out which guitarists play which parts in any band). I think the performance on Am I Evil is actually heavier. I can't say as much for Blitzkrieg besides that it is also well done.\n",
        "\nThere have been thousands of people who have said it, but I'm going to state it again because this album is worthy of all the praise: this is the greatest Metallica album. In my opinion, it is quite simply the best metal album ever recorded. What makes this album so impressive is that this is an album from the same band that released \"Kill 'Em All\" just one year before. It is quite impressive that they musically matured so much in such a short span of time. \n\nThe song structures were so much more interesting, Metallica's famous and amazing rhythm section really came to fruition on this album. The songs were much more defined. The riffs were mighty, memorable, and powerful, Kirk's Mustaine imitating days were over (Not Kirk's fault, I know.) Kirk gave the best performance of his entire recording career, just listen to the solos in \"Creeping Death\" or \"Fight Fire With Fire\" - simply legendary. They're not the most technical solos in the world, but Kirk really knew what melody was. Cliff Burton's insane bass playing really shined on this record, Just listen to his majestic yet chaotic bass lines in \"Call Of Ktulu.\" James pumped out some of the best riffs he has ever made, like on \"Creeping Death.\" Now onto the infamous Lars Ulrich. Being a drummer myself, I must say, the drumming is impressive. This album has some of the most impressive drumming I have ever heard from Lars. He certainly gives Dave Lombardo a run for his money. Just listen to the furious display of thrash drumming on \"Fight Fire with Fire\" or \"Trapped Under Ice\". \n\nThe production is great for its time, as every instrument is heard crystal clear. The guitars are loud and sharp, the drums are nice and punchy (although the bass drum is almost inaudible, disappointingly.) Kirk's solos sound really clean and prominent, just the way a guitar solo should be. Cliff's bass can be a little difficult to hear at times, but you can definitely hear when he starts his crazy bass shredding! The one complaint I have about the production is that it is a little muddy. When there is a faster riff (Ex. \"Fight Fire with Fire\") the guitars sound quite distorted. Also, the bass drum is really damn quiet. It's a shame, because the double bass is truly amazing. \n\nIn the end, this was the pinnacle of Metallica's career. They would still go on to create more great albums (Master of Puppets, ...And Justice For All, Metallica, St. Anger and Death Magnetic) but this album remains their best, and perhaps the best in all of metal music.\n",
        "\nThere has been quite a lot that has influenced Metallica. Punk rock, NWOBHM, and even classic rock, so when the band decided to give a shout out to all three of those musical genres, they released \"Garage Inc.\", an album consisting mainly of covers of the bands that inspired them. What we get here isn't so much an album which contains songs of praise to any of those bands covered as they are giving them a big middle finger, and you would have to listen to hear for yourself.\n\nEverybody knows of Metallica's love of Diamond Head. Yes, there's the song \"Am I Evil\", which we all know so much about, so I'm not going to elaborate on that so much, other than the fact that the guitars are heavier than in the original, typical of Metallica. What really gets me, though is their rendition of \"It's Electric\". Okay, I admit, it's kind of a hokey song, but it's kind of what you'd expect to hear in a NWOBHM band like Diamond Head. Metallica just decided to not only make the guitars heavier, but also put their version of the song down a half-step. If it was a live version, I wouldn't mind so much, since bands tend to tune their songs down a half step when playing live, but this is a studio effort. You don't expect studio efforts to be bogged down like that, I mean, the guitars on the cover of \"Am I Evil\" aren't tuned down, and they're still heavy. \n\nAnd now let's talk about \"Blitzkrieg\", a song that not so much of us are familiar with. It's actually a pretty decent cover, all things considered, as it is a little faster-paced, and of course, a little heavier, but I still consider the original to be better. After the solo in the original, we hear a guitar whammy bar producing a low, eerie, air-raid siren-like sound effect that punctuated the song's subject matter. In the cover version, Kirk just fools around with his whammy bar and produces typical whammy bar sound effects. Yeah, that's quite riveting, Kirk. The burping and Lars talking at the very end of it doesn't help so much either, but I digress. \n\nThen there's their Mercyful Fate medley. Now I'm just speaking my own opinion on this, but I kind of feel that it isn't the same without King Diamond as a lead vocalist. Yeah, I know, there are a lot of people out there that don't like King Diamond's vocals, and that's fine, I can understand. His high falsetto voice just doesn't sit well with everyone. In my opinion, though, his voice is part of the charm of the Mercyful Fate songs covered here. When James Hetfield does it, it just isn't as effective, at least not in my opinion. James and King Diamond have two completely different voices, the complete polar opposites of each other. If anybody likes this medley better than the originals, fine. I know the reasons why. But I just like the originals better. That's just me.\n\nThere are also cover songs that are just downright baffling. Nobody could expect the band to cover Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Tuesday's Gone\", a southern rock ballad. I mean, Metallica and Skynyrd are as far away from each other as music could possibly get, and that's a fact. Don't forget their ill-concieved rendition of Bob Seger's \"Turn the Page\", the original version of which, actually had a saxophone play that riff! Metallica was never meant to cover such songs, 'cos it's like Judas Priest covering a Chuck Berry song, and believe it or not, that actually happened! A more usual candidate for a band Metallica would cover would be Thin Lizzy, but why they chose to cover \"Whiskey in the Jar\", originally an Irish folk song, is beyond me. When hearing the original source material, you just don't hear Metallica at all, you hear something completely different. What's next, a cover of a Grateful Dead song? Knowing the direction Metallica's been taking, I could totally see that happening.\n\nThen we have their rendition of Blue Oyster Cult's \"Astronomy\", yet another head scratcher. The cover version doesn't even have all of the things that made the original sound so mysterious and eerie, they just played it with the guitars and called it a day. The original had a piano/synthesizer, that created a haunting, bleak sound, but the cover version? Nope! Just James and guitars. Though, to be fair, James does seem to have a voice similar to that of Eric Bloom's. Both singers seem to have that tenor baritone voice, and they almost sound like the exact same person. That said, the cover would never top the original, cos the former lacks quite a bit. Just saying.\n\nI have no idea what Metallica was thinking when they came up with this (other than to sell records). Don't get me wrong, Metallica isn't a horrible band, it's just that they seem to have been taking a very odd turn in terms of musical styles, and I could say that \"Garage Inc.\" proves it. Then again, there have been worse things Metallica's done, but I don't need to remind you of those.\n",
        "\nOver the years many have viewed Load as Metallica's start to their so called downfall. Coming off the back of one, if not the biggest selling metal album ever made with their self titled album would never be an easy task, especially when many of Metallica's older fans already claimed they had lost their way when they stopped producing thrash when they teamed up with 80's pop-rock producer Bob Rock to produce said album. If Metallica fans were looking for a more thrash tinged album to compensate for their drop in pace then 'Load' was definitely the album they were fearing the most.\n\nThe majority of this 14 track album is as good as any album you will find. Fair enough, so 'Ain't My Bitch' is not quite the classic opening song that 'Fight Fire With Fire' or 'Battery' is and songs like '2X4' and 'Ronnie' may not have the intensity and speed of anything off their first 4 albums but what we have are songs full of heavy, ballsy riffs, melodies and quite a fair bit of experimenting especially on ''The House That Jack Built' with its voice box and vocal effects which give it quite the atmosphere. 'Until it Sleeps' is where a lot of people seemed to have a problem, not with the song itself (the song went on to be a live favourite throughout the 90's) but with the video in which the band is seen wearing make-up, another reason for the fans of the 'thrash' era to dislike the new Metallica style even more. 'King Nothing' is basically 'Enter Sandman' part 2, down to the little reference at the end but again another live favourite even to this day.\n\nHalfway through the album is where things start to get a little bit messy. After the first of 2 epics, 'Bleeding Me' is where the songs start to lose their interest. songs like 'The Cure' and 'Poor Twisted Me' have some nice riffs but that about it, there's nothing too memorable about them and wouldn't be too missed if they were cut from the album altogether. 'Wasting My Hate' is one of the bands unsung greats, nothing too fancy just full of great riffs and attitude. Why they never play this one live often is a mystery to me. 'Mama Said' is another controversial song with the band experimenting with country music which doesn't really surprise me as Hetfield hasn't exactly been quiet about his love for country music. Of course all good things must come to an end and there's no better ending on a Metallica album than 'The Outlaw Torn,' a near 10 minute epic which is not just the best song on the album but one of Metallica's best songs ever written. As with all the songs on the album its worth mentioning how good the individual performances are on 'Load' especially from Lars Ulrich, who more often than not gets criticised for his almost out of time style of drumming which works wonders on this album. James Hetfield's voice is also one of his strongest and really shows his range from singing the more ballad like songs such as 'Hero of the day' to the more ballsy 'Ain't My Bitch' type songs.\n\nIn the grand scale of Metallica albums 'Load' has a lot more in common with its predecessor than any of their 'classic' 4 albums ever did so its not quite the giant leap which a lot of people claimed that it is. The production on this album is crisp and sharp, just as 'Metallica' before it was. Everything sounds crystal clear which for the most part is never a bad thing but at times it can come across as a 'safe' sounding album but this is just down to personal preference. 'Load' is a highly recommended album for any rock/metal fan out there, sure it has its unmemorable moments and at times it can seem like its dragging and at one second short of 79 minutes, its not an easy album to digest at first but with a few listens it has definitely become one of my favourite Metallica albums.\n\nBe thankful that Metallica didn't continue writing the same old album over and over and that they had the balls to actually try something new and that the risk has paid off tenfold.\n",
        "\nMetallica's place in history is one of a little debate, there is an almost generalized agreement that they are one of the most important and influential metal bands ever. Then there are small groups of detractors who say that they aren't important at all. I come from that first group. In my simple words, I do not believe Metallica invented thrash however Kill Em All was the album that breathed life into the genre and brought forth its fruition, Kill Em All simply made thrash less of an underground scene in the Bay Area and brought it to the attention of metalheads around the world. The Bay Scene was the cannon and Kill Em All was the cannonball that conquered the metal world.\n\nSo while not necessarily spawning or inventing thrash Kill Em All was important to the fruition and success of thrash, which means that Metallica had already given themselves an expectation to live up to. Ride the Lightning slammed into that expectation with a semi. It had songs faster, heavier and more aggressive then anything on Kill Em All but it also laid off and played with other sounds. Forget Master of Puppets, this is the epitome and highlight of Metallica's legacy.\n\nYou want fast aggressive thrashers, well then look to Fight Fire With Fire and Trapped Under Ice. The first is probably the fastest and most aggressive song Metallica will ever release and the latter shows some serious shredding ability. Creeping Death and Ride the Lightning are also solid thrashers but not to the extreme extent as the first two.\n\nMaybe you want a radio rocker but don't want the sleaze and cheesiness of 80s glam, Escape is a perfect balance between radio rock and thrash, maybe not your cup of tea but definitely deserves a listen. Want something a bit more epic? Swing for For Whom the Bell Tolls and Call of Ktullu, two epic sounding pieces of metal capable of outdoing most power metal. This album even contains a power ballad, Fade to Black that has an effect both emotional but also chilling to the bone.\n\nThis album has enough thrash to justify its placement as one of the greatest thrash albums ever but also even from this early in their career has the band experimenting, putting things together and treading water untouched by their peers. The production is solid. While it may not be technical this album is still a masterpiece in composition with tiny bits of progressive thrown in here and there, not much, just enough to show that they know exactly what and where they want to go with each song and how to get there.\n\nOn average you get some good half melodic/half speed guitar riffs, nice bit of muscle to them. I would say the bass follows in suit but it doesn't, in fact the bass is probably the best thing here and it's practically mixed out, Cliff my man, you were awesome. The soloing is all melody, the skilled playing will shine through at times but the emphasis was on melody. The drums keep up the pace. No the drumming is not amazing or anything worthy of praise, even at his high points Lars doesn't hold a candle to his peers, but hes competent and the band made it work just fine. Jame's shout is a great touch and his singing isn't bad at all.\n\nHardest part of this review is choosing the best tracks because they are all musical gold, but I would recommend Creeping Death, Fade to Black, For Whom the Bells Tolls and Escape (if you can handle a commercial sound)\n",
        "\nFive years after a repetitive and dull but commercially successful groove metal release in the form of \"Metallica\", the same band comes around with a headless and boring but once again well selling successor entitled \"Load\". At least Metallica didn't try to copy the sound of the famous predecessor, but to progress and try out new things. Thrash and groove metal elements are almost completely absent on this album. The band headed for a more blues, hard and southern rock influenced sound. This record also includes the first two Metallica songs that feature no guitar solo at all. To underline its new approach, the band went even further and presented a new and ordinary looking new logo and came around with a controversial cover artwork which consists of a mixture of bovine blood and human semen pressed between two sheets of plexiglass. All these somewhat radical changes speak for some sort of midlife crisis of the band and a desperate try to reinvent themselves after the overwhelming success of the past years. Old school fans were going to hate this album anyway but from the artist's point of view, this brave new direction could have brought some fresh air to the band in a time where relationships between the members already started to decrease. While \"Reload\" sounded surprisingly liberating, open-minded and structured with its southern rock influenced style, \"Load\" suffers from an directionless, unimpressive and weak song writing. The album is not only completely overloaded with a running time of seventy-nine minutes but many songs are at least two or three minutes too long and turn out being either endlessly plodding or losing the momentum of the few good ideas present on this release. In fact, there isn't one single track on here that completely pleases me. The better songs on the album have a few creative ideas in form of some atmospheric tones, a few great guitar licks, riffs or solos or some newly introspective lyrics but there isn't one single song without any obvious flaws.\n\nAmong the better tracks on the record is first of all the joyous yet mean opening rocker \"Ain't My Bitch\" that features an energizing rhythm section and a great blues rock inspired guitar solo. On the other side, the track is slightly too long for being a straight opener, the vocal performance sounds humorously exaggerated and the lyrics are quite vapid as well. Five years earlier, this track would have been a bonus track for a single at best and now it's one of the few solid tracks on the entire album. The plodding \"The House Jack Built\" goes the other way around as the lyrics are quite interesting and the eerie vocal effects build up a particular atmosphere. The overtly experimental instrumental section with talkbox effects is though laughable at best and really pesky at worst. This song also drags on for far too long with its chugging riffs and pseudo-progressive sounds. \"Until It Sleeps\" was a quite courageous choice as a first single to represent this release as it has nothing to do at all with the band's past and also feels like a foreign body on this album. It's an alternative rock song with an eerie and hypnotizing atmosphere but which fails to truly develop from there. \"Mama Said\" is a laid back country ballad with acoustic guitars that develops a certain campfire atmosphere. What could have been a truly original track is harmed by an extremely drowsy chorus and annoyingly whiny lyrics.\n\nAll other songs are not even worth mentioning because they sound invalidated, plodding and unspectacular. As they are all terrible, it doesn't make sense to point out any of those confusing, overlong and weak oddities. It really strikes me how the band succeeded most of its experiments on the consistent, energizing and entertaining \"Reload\" while \"Load\" is its complete antithesis and sounds inconsistent, directionless and plain boring. The songs on here are not as bad as several tracks on the oddball that was \"Lulu\" but even this horrible project still had two or three entirely decent tracks which isn't the case for this album as it sounds really unimpressive as a whole. Between a record that has a few great tracks and many truly horrible songs and filler compilation that leaves you completely cold, it's actually quite tough to judge what is worse and that's why my final rating of this failure here could have been even lower than it actually is. In the end, I would still slightly prefer this record to \"Lulu\" but it's a close run. This album was a disappointment when it was initially released back in the days and in comparison to its much better twin album \"Reload\", this record didn't age well and didn't grow on me at all. I would simply suggest you to just avoid this record at all costs if you're not a diehard collector with too much money to waste.\n",
        "\nEven though the experimental rock album \"ReLoad\" consists of leftovers from the controversial and inconsistent \"Load\" release, I actually prefer this record to the predecessor. This album may be a lot of hit and miss but it has an uncompromising and liberating rock'n roll spirit that suits the band much better than the extremely forced commercial groove metal release \"Metallica\" and the failed southern rock output \"Load\" that could never meet the elevated expectations related to the brand name Metallica. From the beginning on, it was clear that this album was sort of a bonus record and more of a compilation than an actual attempt to hit the charts even if it ended up peaking the hit lists all around the world. Without any commercial or stylistical boundaries, this album sounds energizing, experimental and honestly grounded. Especially the vocals are performed with a fresh dose of passion and the passionate hard rock guitar sounds adds a new face to the band. This is what makes this record's charm. If you are looking for a thrash metal record, you're at the wrong address but if you like different rock subgenres and want to hear a band that actually does what it really wants, you could appreciate this album.\n\nIt's obvious that an album filled with thirteen tracks and a running time of more than seventy-six minutes includes a few fillers. These songs are either groove metal tracks or southern hard rock tunes. The monotonous \"Devil's Dance\" has a few catchy hooks but is musically forgettable and sounds like slow paced groove metal. The riffs sound uninspired, the bass guitar doesn't sound distinctive enough and the drumming is so simplistic one gets the impression that Lars Ulrich is playing with a broken arm and a broken leg. In my opinion, this is by far the worst song on the album. \"Bad Seed\" sounds quite similar but has more speed, angrier vocals and a few vocal samples that add some diversity and all these elements keep the track from failing. It's nothing extraordinary but a cool tune to listen to from time to time. \"Prince Charming\" is also among the songs situated somewhere between filler material and average tracks. The hard rock guitar sounds and the motivated vocals save an otherwise boring song. Among the more southern or hard rock driven songs, \"Attitude\" is probably the most energizing and speediest track. Once again, it's nothing exceptional and more of a filler but it works perfectly in the context of the album. Among the four least impressive songs, it's clearly the best.\n\nThe other songs are quite eclectic and experimental and it's a matter of personal taste if you like this kind of music or not. Apart of the endlessly plodding and somewhat headless closer \"Fixxxer\", I do like all of them. My personal standouts are first of all the catchy rocker and yet mysteriously spiritual \"The Memory Remains\" with its unusual and unique backing and guest vocals. Up next is \"The Unforgiven II\" which is by far the best part of the trilogy in my opinion. It's inspired by country music or a western soundtrack and has really unique atmosphere. The versatile, masculine and emotionally driven vocals are really epic in my opinion. The dark, hypnotizing and almost gothic-driven \"Where the Wild Things Are\" is really dragging me into a floating atmosphere and can be described as hidden gem and unexpected grower. It's the kind of eerie song I would have rather expected from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds but the track has a clear concept, a lot of soul and doesn't sound like anything one has heard from Metallica before or ever after. My last personal highlight is the controversially discussed \"Low Man's Lyrics\". I adore the decent and original use of violin and especially hurdy gurdy on this laid back ballad. Once again, the vocals are really outstanding as Hetfield varies from fragile and melodic parts to angrier and rawer passages. The song is not only epic and an emotional roller coaster ride like \"The Unforgiven II\" but also includes simple but great melodies and introspective lyrics. Both ballads are in my opinion among the best the band ever made and are much more unique than other songs of the same kind.\n\nIn the end, I like this record's stripped down, honest and yet eclectic approach and I never get bored of it. Many metal bands experimented back in the days and tried to reinvent themselves. Metallica's attempt at doing so sounds much more convincing to me than anything released by Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer at the same time for example. I can though also understand that metal fans have problems to open up to such a long and at times plodding release. If the band had released the very best songs of this album with the few great cuts from \"Load\" as one experimental southern rock release with a clear guiding line, I guess its perception would be better nowadays. I think that this album is somewhat underestimated for what it is. Maybe it's time for some fans to give this album a new try after all these years of denial. Personally, I really adore two-thirds of the album while the four fillers and the closing oddball are still really acceptable tunes on average which explains my favorable final rating.\n",
        "\nMetallica's \"Garage Inc.\" is only interesting for collectors and die-hard fans as it's a rather odd mixture of newly recorded cover songs and cover songs recorded over more than one decade prior to this release. Even though these are cover songs, they are witnesses of the general controversial development of the band. \n\nThe most interesting tracks on here are actually the first recordings with Jason Newsted, released eleven years earlier as \"The $5.98 EP - Garage Days Re-Revisited\". These five songs are clearly the best on the release. James Hetfield's vocals are mean without overtly employing the strange pronunciation he would later use. The bass guitar is actually audible on here and Jason Newsted proves that he has a lot of technical talent but that he can also play with unchained energy. The guitar riffs are raw and the soli don't overuse the wah-wah pedal yet. Even the drum play is precise and tight. I really wish Metallica had recorded some original material with this raw production and energizing performance as this could have potentially become the best Metallica release ever. These five songs are simply fun to listen to.\n\nThe other songs on the second disc go downhill as the timeline passes by. There are a few highlights such as the famous Diamond Head covers \"Am I Evil?\" and \"The Prince\" or the angry Anti-Nowhere League worship on \"So What\" but the rest is rather generic. It would have been alright to cover one or two Mot\u00f6rhead songs but to put four covers of this band at the end of a record wasn't a brilliant idea. Mot\u00f6rhead is not exactly known for its diversity and originality. This is a general problem of this record as some artists are covered several times. Metallica missed the chance to introduce us to a few more obscure bands that influenced the band's early years. In addition to this, the sound of the more recent tracks is by far not as energizing and mean as the tracks recorded in the eighties.\n\nThe first disc includes only new recordings and they are pretty much hit and miss, just like the \"Load\" and \"ReLoad\" records that both moments of sheer experimental brilliance and headless redundancy. Some more courageous covers are actually grabbing my attention on here. The dark and plodding \"Loverman\" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds is hard to sit through at first contact but has that special gothic atmosphere which I like a lot. The live rendition of the southern rock classic \"Tuesday's Gone\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd with banjo and harmonica is a nice experiment even though this kind of music is usually not really my cup of tea and also far too long with a running time above nine minutes. The cover of the old Irish folk song \"Whiskey in the Jar\" is probably the catchiest tune on here and the obvious single choice. Metallica really managed to make this song sound like one of their own. It would have fit and been a highlight on any of the two previous releases. The only slightly annoying thing is that the old-fashioned chorus coincidentally includes a mildly amusing pronunciation that suits James Hetfield's style of singing since the nineties. As a child, I always imagined James Hetfield singing that he doesn't want to listen to \"Tabaluga tivi on a stereo\" in the chorus. But back then, I also thought that that land mines had taken James' herring and not hearing on \"One\".\n\nAnyway, several of the new cover songs are quite uninspired and boring like the repetitive Discharge's \"Free Speech for the Dumb\" or Misfits' \"Die, Die My Darling\" that sound like hastily recorded jam sessions where Metallica didn't put anything unique into the adaptions. I don't mind faster, simpler and straighter songs at all but these songs don't have the passion and unique twist that similar songs on the second disc have. Metallica sounds like a more or less talented punk cover band on here and it doesn't suit them at all. Some negative examples also tend towards the other extreme. As much as I respect Mercyful Fate, a medley consisting of five songs and a running time of over eleven minutes is just an overkill to me. Half of it would have been more than enough for me. I've never been a fan of medleys which are something that might be used in discotheques where people don't really listen to the music anyway but not on a metal record. While the shorter songs are too simple to leave any deeper impression, the longer songs really drag on for far too long.\n\nAll in all, this album is a lot of hit and miss to me but I must admit that there are more misses than hits. Ultimately, this release is saved by the inclusion of the legendary \"The $5.98 EP - Garage Days Re-Revisited\" songs. If you can grab the original, you should completely ignore this release. Otherwise, I only suggest you to grab this record if you see it for a very low price. This album is not as bad as the overlong \"Lulu\" or the extremely overrated \"Metallica\" but it's not far away from the latter either. I dusted this release off my shelf to give it a few spins after ten years or so and I completely understand why I haven't listened to this record for such a long time. It's a really unspectacular and unnecessary filler compilation with a few hidden gems. This record was ordinary back in the days and it definitely didn't age well either. It would be best for most metal fans to just ignore that this ever happened. This is for truly dedicated fans only.\n",
        "\nLulu is probably the most bizarre album I've ever listened to. I actually was somewhat fortunate to not hear this album when it came out, it was only this year, out of morbid curiosity, that I gave it a listen. I haven't really listened to any of Lou Reed's discography (both his solo stuff and his stuff with The Velvet Underground), so I'm looking at this as a Metallica fan. While this is easily the worst album in Metallica's discography...it's not the worst metal album in their discography. Mainly because this isn't a metal album - it's more of an avant-garde album with some thrash metal elements.\n\nThere are moments where Metallica actually manages to stumble upon a good riff - most notably in \"Iced Honey\" - and that's actually pretty unfortunate; each time this happens, that means that there's one less riff they could've saved for a future album. The ONE member of Metallica who actually didn't seem like he was delivering a sub-par performance is Robert Trujilo, mainly because you can't really hear his performance. And that actually could possibly be because of the production. I didn't expect Lars Ulrich to impress me with drumming on this album, and my expectations were met, they might as well have used a drum machine for this album. I was somewhat disappointed with Kirk Hammett's performance on this album, but James' performance is easily the worst, his backing vocals (Especially on \"The View\") are either tolerable or completely out of place. \n\nAs for Lou Reed's part? While I can't compare it to anything else in his discography (since, as stated earlier, I've never listened to any of his discography), I CAN compare it to a previous album he was a part of, specifically, the song \"Some Kind of Nature\" on Plastic Beach by Gorillaz. On that song, he sounded like he was having a good time, like he knew that people would enjoy his performance on that track. On Lulu, however, it doesn't sound like he's having a good time, it sounds like either A), he's regretting doing this even more as the album gets closer to the end, B), he's drunk, or C), he doesn't care what happens, and just wants to get this over with. I can't completely blame the lyrics on Lou Reed, since this was based on the works of a German playwright. The plays this album is based on were extremely controversial at the time they were written (And at the time of their original production), and even by today's standards, they are pretty explicit. Basically, Lou Reed was already dealing with some extremely controversial material. However, I can't help but feel that he could've worded the lyrics differently, as I had to stop listening to this album several times because I needed to take a moment to process what I had just heard.\n\nDespite everything I've said, there are 2 good things that I can take away from listening to this album, the first is that while I did waste 87 minutes on this abomination, that's 87 minutes of pain that I never have to experience again. The second thing is that there is no way Metallica could make anything worse then this, as St. Anger sounds like The Black Album when compared to this.\n",
        "\nRide the Lightning, the very textbook definition of a classic metal album. Few albums are as important (for both the band and for the thrash sub-genre) and as equally GOOD. There isn't a single stinker on this album, and every song's a classic except for 2 songs. It has a balled that sounds as tender, truly badass, desperate, and epic. It has all out, take no prisoners metal all the way thrashers. It has a songs so epic that power metal shivers before its might! It even has a neoclassical, heck almost progressive metal closer! And the best part, all of these are equally as good, and they all manage to sound coherent and flow.\n\nThe album was very much necessary for Metallica to prove they weren't just the average thrasher. To prove they were something special. Fortunately this album did just what Metallica needed to do. It was a good mix of everything, and Metallica did it all really well. While they weren't the most technical band out there, they knew how to use the skill they had, and they were masters of composition. \n\nThis album as a whole strikes a balance between thrash, traditional, and a tad bit of progressive (however it is a very small amount). There are few albums that sound like it. This of course is surprising considering Metallica was, and is, the most popular thrash metal band ever. The album really is a good combination of styles, and this is why it sticks out in Metallica's discography. The production values here are fine. They are clearly good enough, but they aren't as good as perhaps the could have been. Still, there isn't anything here to complain about, so it is really a moot point. As I have always said, thrash is one of those genres where good production is something we want, not anything necessary. \n\nThe only two tracks that aren't extremely good are \"Trapped Under Ice\" and \"Escape\". Both are average and feel somewhat forced, but both are still fine songs and aren't songs you'll feel the need to get up and skip just to avoid hearing them. It is just that you won't find yourself putting in your ear-buds and listening to them outside of the album setting. The other six songs, are all masterpieces. Every last one of them. Only one of them is really a straight forward thrasher, which showed really how good Metallica was at non-thrash metal music. All of these songs have great riffs and lyrics, and most have great solos to boot. Also, Cliff's bass work here is among his best. On The Call of Ktulu and For Whom the Bell Tolls his bass roars, showing how truly awesome he was at his instrument. He led the band in their non-thrash metal directions and helped push the band forward in ways no one else really could ever have. R.I.P.\n",
        "\nNot gonna lie, I like this album. More than the albums that most people would say are Metallica's classics. Yeah, I can practically feel the metaphorical rocks being thrown in my direction. But hey, I think there are plenty of good thing about this album.\n\nLet's start with the fact that it follows on from 'St. Anger'. Can't get much worse than that, right? So that's instantly a boost to this album's ratings. No, but seriously, this isn't bad at all. It has more of a heavy metal feel to it than thrash, but that's not really too bad. It's really one of the heaviest things I've listened to (kind of odd considering that I've heard a lot of death metal, which is meant to be heavier). Every track has at least some crunching riffs and plenty of drums being beat in Lars' trademark primal fashion. The hooks are solid throughout, James' vocals are pretty much how you'd expect them to be. When you hear Rob's bass it's pretty solid as well.\n\n'Broken, Beat & Scarred' is one of my favourites from this album, heavy riffs coupled with a nice general melody to go with the pounding drums. I can really get into this type of Metallica. The solo is as good as ever as well. The length of the songs on this album are pretty long, but for once that doesn't actually seem to matter too much to me. When the music is that good, the length isn't too important as long as it doesn't end too abruptly or last twenty-odd minutes.\n\nI also like 'All Nightmare Long', which kind of follows along the same lines of hard beating drums and heavy riffs. The opening is great as well, I like the mix of seemingly delicate guitar chords and heavy riffs. Then when the song launches into the heavy hooks that you'd expect, it just fits so well. I don't know how people can manage not to like this song in all honesty, it combines everything you need to make a good metal song. At nearly eight minutes long this song does feel like maybe it's starting to get stale at the end, but it does end in time to stop the song being ruined. Besides, after listening to longer songs that are far more boring, this one is still pretty fresh by the end.\n\nBasically the whole album is pretty much full of the same kind of songs, from the \"short\" 'My Apocalypse' (still five minutes long) to 'Cyanide' and the instrumental 'Suicide & Redemption', the album is filled mostly of heavy headbanging tracks. However, there are two songs that don't follow this pattern, 'The Day That Never Comes' and 'The Unforgiven III'. Both of them are a lot slower and despite featuring heavy electric guitars they both feel slightly lighter than the other songs. They do add a bit of variety to an album that otherwise follows the same layout though, which is good.\n\nThe last song I want to describe is the only instrumental, 'Suicide & Redemption'. At ten minutes long it is the longest track on the album, and with no vocals you might think that it'd get boring. It does no such thing. The general riffs sound like they're from a classic metal or rock track track, they just have that kind of quality about them. Then the solos that haunt the song also have that kind of feel about them. Really, if it had lyrics to it then I'd have thought it was one of the most well-known tracks from the eighties or nineties. You can't help but join in with the song in some way, whether it's tapping your feet or headbanging or playing the air drums.\n\nReally, the Metallica haters should listen to this album. They can say what they want about 'St. Anger' or any other of their mediocre albums (I'm going to leave that up to you to decide which ones fall into that category), but 'Death Magnetic' is like they've been reborn better than before. The whole thing is an excellent example of why not to write a band off after a bad album. Five years later, they might come out with something like this.\n",
        "\nBefore I start this review I'll spit off that I am a complete Metallica fanboy. I enjoyed all of their 80s albums, I loved the Black Album, Load, Reload and S&M. I even bought their movie the day it was released on Blue Ray. In fact there are only two Metallica releases that I abhor, this and Lulu.\n\nThis right here is just bad. There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said before so this might as well be a rehash of what has been said over and over. First off the guitar work is half assed, every song is just one riff done over and over again. There aren't any solos to break the monotony either, the band has two guitars but they both play this monotonous riff. The tone of the guitar is also gratingly annoying. The combination of monotony, the tone of guitar and the length of the songs makes listening to a track front back comparable to running a marathon. The riffs themselves have blunt force power, but this comes purely from the production, its loud and the tone is crap so these riffs literally sound like blunt force, yeah its heavy, extremely heavy but it gets way too old way too fast. It could be really fucking awesome but instead its a pile of brute force that pounds against itself and the fabric of the music itself.\n\nNext comes the drums, which can be summarized by comparing them to pounding on a trash can, let me tell ya, it gets old real fast. I guess as far as drum work goes this is better then some past efforts but that damn trash can sound kills any possible interest I could have in the percussion department. It goes between fast parts and slow parts but that could go for most past Metallica drum work. It doesn't do anything particularly flashy and unlike past Metallica records it just keeps time instead of going that extra mile where it digs its way into the melody. It drowns everything else out, yeah even that overly brute forced guitar sound gets drowned out and I can't tell if that's good or bad.\n\nThe bass mimics the guitar part, Cliff is probably in heaven trying to slit his wrists from hearing the bass on this album. Its drowned out on most of the album. It doesn't seem to really add anything sound wise, just kinda there because metal albums are expected to have to a bass to round out the sound, but this bass doesn't round out the sound, it doesn't add any layers, its simply just there.\n\nJames singing is at an all time low. Those singing classes he took in the late 80s and early 90s, yeah seems like he completely ignored them when recording this. He doesn't use his range very much at all. He sounds angry though so I guess he nailed that part. Too bad the lyrics are crap though. Just like the guitar they seem half assed, seriously \u2018tick tock tick tock tick tock', honestly if it were any other band these lyrics probably wouldn't bother me at all but damn I know James could do so much better and still express the angsty angry feeling that the album is so obviously meant to deliver.\n\nFinally is the bad production, it doesn't make the album sound raw, it just drowns everything out beneath that damn trash can lid. There are plenty of great low fi albums out there, I guess Metallica just can't pull that sound off anymore. This is the first low fi they've released since their pre Kill Em All demos. \n\nSo yeah, sure, this is the heaviest most blunt force thing Metallica has made, in fact most things, even some death metal, grindcore and deathcore pale in comparison. The writing, the production, all of it is just... frustrating. Songwriting has gone completely down the drain.\n",
        "\n\"King Nothing\" is one the best track on the highly underrated \"Load\" album released in -96. The track is heavy and catchy, just like \"Enter Sandman\", and the song actually ends with the same words; \"Off to never-never land.\" The riffs are awesome and the bass is loud, Jason Newsted always has a great bass tone, too bad you didn't get to hear it on the \"Justice\" album. Kirk's solo is great and I actually like his use of the wah-pedal on the \"Load\" and \"Reload\" albums, before it got out of hand. This solo is the best on the album after \"Bleeding Me\". The drumming is nothing impressive, but that doesn't really matter.\n\nThe song is about people who devote their entire lives to be successful and earn money until one day, they realize (\"then it all crashes down\") that all their money has gotten them nothing worthwhile. They have wasted their whole life in pursuit of money and status instead of living and being truly happy (where's your crown, king nothing?). Hetfield's vocals on this five minute track, just like throughout most of the record, is fantastic and the lyrics are easy to sing along to.\n\nMy overall impression of this song is that it's one of the best songs from all three album released by the band in the 90's. \"Bleeding Me\" and \"The Outlaw Torn\" are the only better songs from the \"Load\" album, and most people that doesn't like this album, tend to like \"King Nothing.\" Although the underrated \"Load\" and \"Reload\" albums are disliked by many fans, it shows Metallica's diversity and creativity in songwriting, as well as Hetfield's best singing of his career. \"King Nothing\" is a perfect example of that.\n",
        "\nMetallica\u2019s black album lacks so much originality that it isn\u2019t even worth a proper name. The band kept only the worst parts of the great predecessor \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d, namely a very clinical production and the groove metal influences. Instead of adding diversified progressive elements, the band headed for a more commercial direction and focused on writing short tracks with simple choruses that are repeated to death. It\u2019s a sad thing to say but the most interesting songs on here are the longer and calmer tracks reminding of Metallica\u2019s last release or more commercial hard rock inspired by bands from Led Zeppelin to Guns \u2018N Roses. These tracks don\u2019t fit with the harsher, shorter and more repetitive tunes. Namely, the best songs on the record are the epic and melancholic ballad \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d, the laid back, melodic and minimalist ballad \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d and finally the dynamical \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d that recalls the last album and surprises with a few oriental folk sounds as guiding line. Album closer \u201cThe Struggle Within\u201d is a little bit more dynamical and faster as it tries to go back to the thrash metal roots of the band but it really suffers from its chugging riffs and lifeless production. \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d is the only song of the new groove metal style that works for me because it has some atmosphere building up some tension in the song writing and the whole thing is crowned by the strongest chorus of this album. This kind of song has been played to death on radio and television but it\u2019s still a good average album opener. Everything else is completely forgettable for me.\n\nThe rest is basically modern groove metal with chugging mid-tempo riffs, clinical drumming and an exchangeable bass guitar sound that barely sounds better than on the predecessor where this instrument was almost inaudible. In addition to this, James Hetfield\u2019s vocal performance starts to sound truly ridiculous on this album. Most songs include highly exaggerated pronunciation and unnecessary exclamations and fill words such as \u201cah!\u201d, \u201coho\u201d and especially \u201cyeah\u201d. This may sound energizing on one or two tracks but it gets really annoying throughout the twelve songs including many fillers on here. The worst examples for this vocal style are the atmospheric opener \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d and the energizing \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d. These tracks are among the better ones on the album and a more serious vocal performance would even have rated them up. Weaker tracks like the extremely annoying \u201cThrough the Never\u201d that almost feels as if James Hetfield was hectically and randomly shouting chopped up scraps of conversation while playing unnecessarily aggressive and yet chugging and repetitive riffs at the same time are really among the worst material Metallica has ever recorded. This song is often cited as more traditional thrash metal song but it\u2019s rather an example of fast paced groove metal that is maybe even more annoying than mid-tempo mallcore. \n\nThere are so many bad songs on here but the worst musical example for what is Metallica\u2019s least original release and in my opinion also worst album apart of the abominable project \u201cLulu\u201d with the late Lou Reed must be \u201cSad but True\u201d where the title already says everything I think about this track. Basically, this song is based around exchangeable groove metal riffs and an unharmonious chorus. The verses sound like rap metal of the worst kind and I\u2019m not surprised that Snoop Dogg, the rapper with the least enthusiastic vocal performance I\u2019ve ever known, has once covered this track. I don\u2019t have any problems with a passionate fusion of rap and metal as Anthrax and Public Enemy have proven that this combination can in fact work very well. While \u201cI\u2019m the Man\u201d is a vivid example with a fierce attitude, \u201cSad but True\u201d is its complete antithesis and comes around with lifeless guitar sounds and a boring vocal performance. I really hate using the term mallcore but this song is somehow the prototype for the worst executions of this genre. It\u2019s somehow a song that has pioneered a genre but in this case, it\u2019s nothing to be proud of.\n\nIn the end, this record has three good tracks and two average songs that don\u2019t really fit to the other material which consists of abominable groove metal with lifeless instrumental sections, ridiculous vocal performances and a horrible production that annoys me much more than the uncompromising sound of \u201cSt. Anger\u201d. Just listen to the artificial sound and slowed down drum play in the opening of the annoying \u201cOf Wolf And Men\u201d to get to know what I mean. I absolutely don't get why some people still claim that this album has a great production. Even pop albums of that time sound more dynamical than this. After all, clever marketing, shorter and catchier song structures and a more commercial approach influenced by actual trends of its time have still made what is Metallica\u2019 worst regular studio record its most successful release. As a big metal fan, I\u2019m really not proud of the fact that this is probably the most famous genre release of all times. There really is no need to purchase this record at all as the best tracks on here are still performed live and can be found with a much better sound on many different concert releases. Don\u2019t believe the hype around this release and avoid it at all costs.\n",
        "\n\"Hero of the Day\" is the second single released from \"Load.\" This song for me is all about feel. It's a hard rock ballad with two heavy parts. The intro and verses are played with clean guitars and the music here puts you in one mood, whilst the chorus is played with distortion guitars and puts you in another. The heavy parts feature power chords and double bass drumming, these parts put you in a third mood. The music is great, but the best thing about the song is the lyrics and the vocal melody. The last part of the guitar solo as it goes into the chorus gives me chills every time. A lot of my attachment to this album comes from nostalgia, so I can understand that many people don't realize how fantastic the \"Load\" and \"Reload\" albums actually are.\n\n\nJames wrote this song about the people who are looking for heroes within the media and entertainment. The song says that those people searching for heroes do not realize that the heroes are the people they come across in everyday life. This is indeed a beautiful song, that still to this day gets my emotions going whenever I hear it. \"Hero of the Day\" has some of best lyrics the album, and Hetfield's vocals are top notch. It's kinda hard to explain the feelings that I get from this song, but the singing and lyrics during the chorus and last heavy part is simply fantastic. \n\n\n\"Hero of the Day\" is one of the best songs from \"Load,\" and when we're talking ballads, definitely a better song than \"Nothing Else Matters.\" It still gets crushed by the masterpiece that is \"Bleeding Me,\" but that doesn't really matter. The other song on the single is the \"Kill/Ride Medley,\" recorded live in England, '95. I think it was a smart move to add a 10 minute thrash mayhem track to even out the calmness of the ballad. There are other versions of the single featuring different Motorhead covers, a remix and a demo. However, this version is the best.\n",
        "\nI wanted to review this album because I thought I could offer a more objective view than you'd get from angry Metallica fanboys or people simply jumping on the bandwagon of hate. I enjoy Metallica's first few albums immensely (who doesn't?) and am fond of some of Lou Reed's work but only stretching as far as the Velvet Underground and particularly Perfect Day.\n\nAnd yet there is something so intrinsically bad about Lulu. Everything about this album just kind of fits together like some sort of auto-erotic contraption designed so Hetfield and Reed can give themselves self-congratulatory blowjobs. Lulu is dull, pretentious, terrifying and strangely laughable. Until I saw our torturers in chief flashing the camera a big shit-eating grin while sincerely telling us how they \"brought out the best in each other\" I would probably have called this project out as a joke. It's about time they released Spinal Tap 2 isn't it? And James does look an awful lot like Will Ferrell with bellybutton fluff strapped to his chin.\n\nThe main problems with this album are well documented. Tracks time average at about 8 minutes and, unforgivably, have about two riffs each which are bland and mediocre anyway. I stress that this isn't simply isn't a subjective criticism of my own; bands such as Electric Wizard or Godflesh have shown time and time again that a single amazing riff or an inspired atmosphere can carry songs for similar lengths of time without grating your patience at all. But Lulu sounds like The production values are decent enough. There's no return of the world's worst snare drum, the guitars are ok and the bass is just about audible though not utilised. Things are ok, nothing more and nothing less. Bland and uninspired. This is possibly the best thing about the album.\n\nUndoubtedly the worst part (or best depending on how you look at it) of this sordid combination is the lyrical content. Lou Reed's utterances are atonal, banal and downright senile. They fail to follow any discernible pattern and are spoken at random pitches, like a singing birthday card dangerously low on battery. Low on battery. What? Oh, I almost forgot; every other line on the album is repeated for good measure. Coloured man's dicks, dog prostitutes and sniffing shit in the wind have surely never seen so much exposure. Hetfield occasionally gets a word in edgeways but then you wish he didn't. 'Brandenburg Gate' features a chorus that sounds like it was written by a retarded Billy Joel. \"SMALL TOOOOOOWN GUUUUURL\". I preferred it when you were the table.\n\nThe problem with a composition lacking in any charisma or passion is that it highlights the weaknesses in the individual artists. One live performance in Germany is particularly telling. Several hundred people surround the stage wondering whether if wandered into an amateur poetry night at Middlesbrough Wetherspoons. Lars Ulrich bangs away at his drums with the enthusiasm and skill of a baby with a rattle. Kirk Hammett's own emotions betray him as his face desperately tries to etch itself into a carving of respect as Lou Reed drones on about vulvas and dog shit. Trujilo plays his muted basslines stoicly, his cold dead eyes glazing over and resembling what can only be compared to a war criminal at The Hague. They know what they've become and that is their punishment. Meanwhile Hetfield and Reed grin manically at each and trade some cringe-worthy banter between songs. They're practically fucking each other in their minds at this point. Who knows what the German audience are thinking? Some nod their heads like sad fathers trying to enjoy their son's music while a select few start to headbang - presumably people who missed the fall of the Berlin Wall and are seeing an electric guitar for the very first time. Repetitive songs interspersed by awkward interviews suffering from translation barriers and composed of tired soundbites from the band members continue still. \"We haven't played this out in public naked like this have we\"? James asks. \"Not for an hour\" replies Reed, practically taking the piss at this point.\n\nThere are some tolerable songs on this album mind. Not good but tolerable. Iced Honey hums along with more rhythm than any other song but still suffers from the same problems - one or two riffs repeated again and again ad infinitum. On the other end of the spectrum Junior Dad is an absolute disaster at 19 fucking minutes long. There are rules against this kind of thing in the Geneva Convention. 10 whole minutes of one mind-numbing riff followed by 9 minutes of ambience, presumably the sound transcribed when one shoves his head up Lou Reed's arsehole. At least you have to give props to Metallica for not selling out. This album isn't pandering to anyone at all bar their own egos.\n\nThere's really no getting away from it, this is a terrible album. Truly terrible. And yet I recommend you listen to it. You know the way people will slow down on a motorway to get a good look at a car accident? Well that's why. This album is hilarious. We're through the looking glass people. This is what happens when a band becomes completely detached from reality. Now if you'll excuse me I need a long cold shower.\n",
        "\nThis box set covers a lot of shit - some 8 or 9 hours of it, and approximately one third of that is complete shit. There are boring bass solos. There are fucking Kirk Hammett guitar solos, and we all know that he's not exactly the best guitar player in the world, nor the most imaginative. There is Lars Ulrich drum solo - hey, there's even James Hetfield drum solo. Hell, even Jason plays drums at one point (and sings Seek and Destroy at another). But most of all, there's too much noodling during songs (a lot more on the post Black album recordings than on '89 DVD). For example, Seek and Destroy is stretched into 15 minutes (18 in audio version!), which might be bearable if you were at the show itself, but not behind your TV screen. \"We've turned Metallica into a circus act\" is what Lars says at one point, and I couldn't have said it better myself.\n\nBut when they rock, they rock hard. Most of the material here was recorded in '92 and '93, soon after they hit it big with Black album and not all that long before they cut their hair and balls and plagued the world with Load and other stuff. Whiplash, for example, is turned into a more vicious thrasher that it was originally, and basically everything here is played on a high level, both accurate and with remarkable dose of energy. One could argue about song selection, as there could never be enough stuff from first 4 albums and there's too much from Black album, but even these later songs sound better live than they did in studio (less sterile for sure). \n\nWhat this box set is is a great testament of an era when Metallica was basically rock band no. 1, when grade school kids listed them as their favourite band along with Roxette and Billy Idol and Bon Jovi, when they brought metal into households - there was just no way of escaping them. This is a testament of a band who turned many kids into metal, many of which \"overgrew\" them during the years to come. Its historical importance cannot be denied, but that still doesn't mean it's a live recording to end all live recordings. \n\nUnlike Cliff 'em All home vid for example, which you could (at least I could) watch over and over again, the videos presented here are fun to watch maybe once every 4 or 5 years, and even then with friends, booze and skip button as a necessary equipment. Audio part of box is on more constant rotation, as it doesn't require non-stop attention, but it needs skips as well (especially the 18 minute long guitar/bass solos and 18 minute long Seek and Destroy).\n\nDespite all the shit thrown in, this box could easily get 85 or so after first watch / listen. Cut out 1/3 of it, and we got a 90 here. But the way it is, it's just not made for repeated watches. And remember, this thing originally cost some $75 or so, and that's too much for something you actually need to watch only once. 68 there is, then. Recommended for watching / listening, but not recommended for buying, unless you need a dust collector.\n",
        "\nSome people might think it's a bit overbloated to have so many reviews on just a single, but it's the controversial Bay Area band Metallica we're talking here. Their first original output to be published after the always infamous Lulu came out years ago, \"Lords of Summer\" serves as both an update of their musical style nowadays and some kind of prologue for whatever their New Album is going to be. It's not even a complete version, as the band passes it for a \"First Pass Version\", maybe afraid of compromising themselves to an album single, or out of request by their fans to release a studio version for this song, which has already been played in live shows.\n\nOn to the song. The first impressions I had were good, maybe because the drums didn't sound as loud as they did on Death Magnetic and Beyond Magnetic; and while the guitar doesn't quite fit 100% into the rest of the band it sounds good enough for a heavy metal song. The riffs are quite decent, faster to what we were accustomed with the 90's Metallica; and stand out particularly in the verses, a feature that adds aggressiveness to James Hetfield's vocals. I also have to mention Kirk Hammett's guitar solo, very similar to that of \"All Nightmare Long\", a solo I personally liked from their previous album. It was a nice addition to the song, even when Hammett shows he still can't (And won't) let go of his wah.\n\nNow I can't ask a 50-year-old man who has been singing for more than 30 years to sound like he did back in Kill' em all, so I'll take Hetfield's vocals for what they are, and while they obviously are no Justice-like vocals, they do seem to help the overall heaviness of the song, a slight improvement over Death Magnetic. James' singing sounds menacing and does not stop at any time of the song to do some soft, cowboy-like singing like he did back in the 90s and even back in Metallica's last album. On to the drums. Lars Ulrich has been struggling to play with double bass pedal for almost a decade or so now and sometimes I wonder whether he should retire, go on to manage Metallica's administrative part, and still go on tour with them but leaving the drums to someone who doesn't drag down the pace of the songs like he does here. Some of the drum patterns he does are just outright lazy and become boring when you hear them for too long, which brings me to the other point I didn't like about \"Lords of Summer\": The song is too long. It suffers from the same flaw as Death Magnetic's \"Suicide and Redemption\" or \"The Judas Kiss\", and it extends itself more than it has to. You'll find yourself wondering why didn't they extend the more energetic, fast parts of the song and did extend the laid-back wannabe-heavy parts of it (Beginning of the Chorus). I don't have much to say about the bass, except it was audible, and Robert Trujillo did his job just fine.\n\nI'm not the kind of person who says a band is back when their sound starts to show a slight glimpse of resemblance to their initial albums, and I also think Metallica doesn't really want to go back and do a carbon copy of Master of Puppets this time and day. But even in spite of its flaws I did find myself enjoying Metallica's new output, which also proved their unfortunate experiment with Lou Reed to be just a one-off experiment. The song is overlong and sometimes uninspired in some parts but I think it's a heavy, fast-paced and an overall step in the right direction for the band following Death/Beyond Magnetic, and it brings a good boost of hype to their fans while they wait for their new album to come out.\n",
        "\nEvery year, I decide to be a little reflective and revisit Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" as a sort of nostalgic look at the origins/birth place of my love for heavy metal. Each time I go back to this record I preface the listening process by asking myself if the album will still have the same effect on me as it did when I was in third grade. And as tradition goes, I'm always reassured of the unadulterated timelessness that this masterpiece of musical craftsmanship contains. Putting aside the various different musical decisions this band has collectively made in its over thirty years of existence, \"Master of Puppets\" is and will forever remain a staple of brilliance in the ongoing metamorphosis of heavy music. \n\nThe opening acoustics of the album's first track, \"Battery,\" puts the listener in the perfect mindset of a quasi-sequel to the band's previous album, \"Ride the Lightning.\" After an estimated minute of tranquility, the track transforms into an uncompromisingly ferocious lick of fast tempos and machine-gun guitar riffs. Here, it becomes apparent that Metallica operates around similar lyrical content to their previous efforts while simultaneously shuffling around the order in which the content is presented. The line \"...smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me, cannot stop the battery,\" much like Metallica's \"Whiplash,\" is almost a sort of declaration to the band's fan base. No matter what the band goes through, or what obstacles it faces, there's nothing that can possibly stop its drive. \n\nThe albums title track is a whole different animal. \"Master of Puppets\" is a demented descent into madness, provided by James Hetfield's incredibly thought provoking song writing. Hetfield has never evoked a stronger sense of powerlessness and self loathing in his music. Each verse pushes the listener further and further into a never ending exhibition of hatred and suicidal contemplation. It's simply one of the finest songs ever made. \n\nEach track on the album provides a different stepping stone dynamically. Whether a five minute thrasher or a seven and a half minute ballad, the presentation of Metallica's music here is absolutely relentless. James Hetfield leads the musical charge on this record with some of the greatest riffs to ever bless the genre. Kirk Hammett's guitar solos work to almost exacerbate the madness and despair that the band provides both musically and lyrically. While Lars Ulrich's drumming isn't technically brilliant, he does a fine job at keeping speed with the outrageously fast movement of his three band mates. The late Cliff Burton overlays it all with some dementedly heavy distortion. The real majesty of his effort here is finally displayed full force in the albums instrumental \"Orion,\" in which Burton gives one of the finest bass performances in his short lived career. \n\nWhether Hetfield tackles topics of self destruction, the horrors of war, or mental instability, each song never strays away too far to lose the attention of the listener. Its a disturbingly entertaining record. Each track is placed in such a strategic way as to evoke all the right emotions in the perfect order. As a nine year old, hearing this album for the first time gave me my first exploration of an entire realm of music that explores the darkest themes of the human condition. As I grow older, it only becomes more apparent of how successful Metallica were able to shed light on these psychological motifs of our existence. Each riff by Hetfield and every solo by Hammett have been ingrained into my psyche. Without trying to sound too pompous or derivative, \"Master of Puppets\" really is one of the greatest albums of all time. I'm certainly not the first one to say this, and I definitely won't be the last. For me, its the notion of control that still gets to me. Whether control by another human being, or an introverted and reflexive experience, Metallica's commentary on one of humanities most neurologically and sociologically troubling actions is absolutely perfect. It goes without saying that \"Master of Puppets\" is a must listen. A timeless record from one of music's biggest bands.\n",
        "\nThis song truly marks the beginning of Metallica's commercialization. This isn't something that bothers me personally and whenever someone uses 'mainstream' or 'radio friendly' as an excuse to hate this song (or any other metal release) I feel responsible to remind them that Sabbath's first few albums hit the billboards and I've heard Iron Maiden and Metallica's earlier music on a local radio station that usually sticks to rap rock fusions.\n\nLook at me ranting though, you're reading this because you want to know my feelings on this release. Metallica has never backed away from ballads and some of their best songs are ballads (Fade to Black and One) so it seems logical in my head to assume that even if they had stuck to their old sound a song like this would come through eventually.\n\nThis song is not heavy, it does not have a fast tempo or technicality. This song gains power from something else: pure emotion. From the second that acoustic guitar starts playing its like a wave of pure expression and it only builds from there. Next comes the singing, never before has James captured this much feeling in his vocals and the song continues build up as the electric guitar sneaks into the chorus and finally the finishes with that solo, a very short but powerful and moving solo. This song has one draw back, it is very simplistic. Simplistic enough that the first time I picked up a guitar I was able to learn how to play the beginning 'riff' with no knowledge of musical theory or guitar playing at all. \n\nIf you're a bit more of a casual listener of all forms of music you'll find this track to be enjoyable, if not then I'd recommend you avoid it.\n",
        "\nWhether or not you believe that Metallica have completely sold out and crafted wave after wave of shitty albums in recent times (and, barring Death Magnetic, I'd probably agree with you), there should be no denying that Metallica were the force behind some of the most legendary records in metal history. While many of their 80s thrash metal peers were concerned with being as fast and aggressive as possible and cutting the musical \"fat,\" Metallica were bent on retaining their more progressive roots stemming from the likes of Queen and Rush. Coupled with the virtuosity of the late bassist Cliff Burton's playing and slightly slower (sometimes drastically slower) tempos than your standard thrash act, this was a band who preferred longer and more complex arrangements. That's obviously not to say they weren't a full-fledged thrash band, however - songs like \"Battery,\" \"Trapped Under Ice,\" and almost all of Kill 'Em All certainly solidified the band's presence with the Big 4 of Thrash alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. And despite Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning being 80s metal masterpieces in their own rights, Master of Puppets might just be the pinnacle of the band's work.\n\nIn many ways, Master of Puppets seems to be a refined retread of Ride the Lightning. Right down to the nature of the track placements and similar song structures, the latter seems rife with nods to the former; however, a numerous key elements ensure that both can be separated and judged on their own individual merits. First off, James Hetfield's voice is simply better and sounds more confident on this thing. His softer voice sounds more emotional and sensitive here than his singing on \"Fade to Black\" and his harsher offerings fit the high-intensity riffs - right from the beginning verses he spits in \"Battery\" to the ominous whisper that concludes the speedy closer \"Damage Inc.\" But, as usual, the music is what it's all about - and Master of Puppets' variety is what really makes it stand out above their other records. There's no question about Ride the Lightning being the more thrash-oriented record when comparing both albums, but the slight lack of thrash in Master of Puppets actually works in its favor. The classical guitar introduction that precedes the crazy riff-fest known as \"Battery\" offers a wonderful buildup that flows perfectly into the song at hand by ratcheting up the intensity by increments before exploding into its speedy tempo. \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" and \"Orion\" operate in a similar way, but much more gradually. Both could be considered the most progressive songs on the album, and weave through multiple intricate guitar arrangements before revealing their big payoffs.\n\nHowever, it's more than just that. It's not just the variety in the music that impresses, but the variety in every aspect of the record. The production is varied, being brash and loud for the faster tunes while laying low and giving off an ominous atmosphere for other songs such as \"Welcome Home\" or \"The Thing that Should Not Be.\" Likewise, the atmosphere and overall mood of the experience is very diverse; \"Orion\" feels epic and climactic, \"Battery\" and \"Damage Inc.\" are destructive and harsh, \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Disposable Heroes\" feel more like cautionary tales (and, considering their subject matter, pretty much are), and so on. This feels like a thematically \"complete\" record; there are barely any loose ends musically, and the entire thing just feels pieced together meticulously. The only thing dragging the album down is, funny enough, the feeling that some of the compositions drag a bit. \"Orion\" and \"The Thing that Should Not Be,\" while great songs, tend to be the worst offenders when considering how long it takes to trudge through to each song's peak. It's nice to hear such drastic tempo changes to switch things up, but not if it hurts the pace of the album. Regardless, it's a small blemish in an otherwise amazing overall product. \n\nCritics may be stretching their points pretty far when considering Master of Puppets one of the best metal albums all time; hell, many have gone on to consider it THE best metal album ever made. Seeing as there's such a vast well of amazing metal music out below the popular surface that's just waiting to be heard and enjoyed, it's tough to make a case for Master of Puppets being the be-all-end-all album for the genre. With that said, one should at least respect the hell out of the record for what it's done to influence rock music as a whole, as well as for its bevy of amazing thrash compositions. It ain't perfect, but it's a real damn force to be reckoned with. If you love thrash and/or love heavy metal in general, this is essential listening.\n",
        "\nThe misadventures of being a bargain bin cowboy occasionally lands one's lasso on some surprising satisfying past curiosities, but more often than not, the gain is proportional to the price. Granted, singles are usually not a terribly profitable venture, but when a measly dollar is all that's in view, it offers a little more staying power than a dinky little McDonald's hamburger. Thus is the tale of my rendezvous with Metallica's iconic commercial breakthrough single Enter Sandman, a polarizing musical affair for most who had any level of familiarity with the band prior to their recent success on MTV via their previous album, let alone their core thrash metal fan base from the early underground days of the mid 80s. While the author of this review will not deny being captivated by this song originally as it hit the radio just after his 11th birthday and he was still fairly new to metal, suffice to say, the years and further education into what constitutes metal have not been kind.\n\nThis was one of the few occasions where Kirk Hammett's rhythm playing became the focal point of the song, though Urlich and Hetfield definitely had massive input into honing this thing into it's final outcome. However, the true master behind the scenes of what occurs on this ode to the land of nightmares is Bob Rock, whose devotion to AC/DC oriented minimalism results in a very stagnant listen where a single riff cycles through a frustratingly long series of gradual changes and is only greeted with an occasional and fairly fleeting turnaround. Likewise, the early 90s obsession with overproducing the drums results in a sound that is massive, but also so much so that it almost becomes unintentional parody (see Queensryche's Empire for another example of this). From an overall production standpoint, every little moving part is so well mixed and nuanced that it is, for lack of a better word, perfect. Consequently, this perfection serves to attempt to mask a lack of power in the idea department, which plays well to rock radio trustees (who were the overwhelming majority at the time) but is about as telltale of a sign of antagonism to the spirit of metal, thrash or otherwise, as one can possibly make.\n\nIf the A side of this fit of commercial pandering stood alone on this release, it would not have been worth it's dollar price tag, but there is a somewhat redeeming B side to consider. The cover of Queen's \"Stone Cold Crazy\" was originally released on a 40 year anniversary compilation put out by Electra Records, but this was the first opportunity for Metallica fans to hear this cover without other stuff gumming up the listening experience, and it does present a few saving graces. It reaches back to a time just before Bob Rock took control of the creative process, and features the band playing faster than their \"Black Album\" peak tempo. It's rawer, nastier, and far more vital than just about anything that ended up rounding out the LP in question, with maybe the exceptions of \"Through The Never\" and \"Struggle Within\", and actually passes for a thrash song. It's pretty easy to see the line of succession from Queen's songwriting here and the eventual riffing style of Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg and a few others that would pave the way for Metallica's widely heralded debut, and the only mind boggling part of it all is why Metallica waited until 1990 to give this song a proper studio nod.\n\nFrom a buyer's perspective, this is not really worth seeking out as the \"Stone Cold Crazy\" cover ended up on the Garage Inc., which is probably also a more readily available purchase for second hand treasure hunters, though there's a healthy level of crap to go with the good there. Likewise, this doesn't come with a demo version of the A side that would really make it a worthwhile go for completists, even if they are absolutely in love with Metallica's 1991 mainstream venture. From a metal standpoint, this is half good, half abomination; but even to a casual consumer of this longstanding art form, the sandman is offering little more than a snooze fest followed by a jolting wake up call.\n",
        "\nMetallica has very forgiving fans, despite the widespread condemnation of their many massive career mistakes in the name of misguided commercialism. If the average fan of this band wasn't forgiving, they wouldn't have any left to market to at this point. To dispense with the obvious, the first studio outing since the horrid abortion that was Lulu is an attempt to remedy yet another massive blunder and make good with the legions of battered spouses that make up Metallica's core audience. It comes in the form of a single with a sub-title of \"First Pass Version\" which would seem to suggest the band's keen awareness of how badly they've alienated their fans and are testing the waters to see whether or not they stand to be eaten alive by a legion of proverbial pissed off piranhas.\n\nSuffice to say, \"Lords Of Summer\" is not a let down in the same sense of previous attempts at sneaking back into the metal medium, although it still leaves a good bit to be desired. After about 20 years of missing the mark, Lars has finally gotten it though his thick gnome skull that he needs to ease off the tension on the snare drum and also level out the mixing of his kit, almost to the point of at least getting things back to they were when \"The Black Album\" was put together. Similarly, the guitar sound has managed to regain at least some level of clarity and crunch, though it sounds a bit too warm and smooth for a thrash album. James Hetfield has likewise attempted to gruff up his voice a bit so that he doesn't quite sound like a depressed country & western hack, though at its grittiest it just manages to pass for how he sounded just before he blew his voice out in the mid 90s.\n\nWhere this song both succeeds to an extent but still comes up short is the songwriting department, and in a very similar fashion to the better moments heard on Death Magnetic. In a clear attempt to resurrect the long and repetitive character of ...And Justice For All, this thing coasts along for over 8 minutes while being stuck in the same tempo and feel. The riff work doesn't come off as terribly inspired and relies far too much on repetition, a problem that has dogged this band to varying degrees since the late 80s. The silver lining is that Kirk Hammett has been allotted a decent guitar solo section, though it sort of stands alone in what is otherwise a very contrived and redundant song. In essence, take any one of the leftover tracks from the 2012 Beyond Magnetic EP and give them a slightly better production and you have \"Lords Of Summer\".\n\nThis isn't a song that is necessarily worthy of the metal scrapheap, but if this is only a first draft of this song, Lars and company would do well to shave about 2 minutes worth of needless repetition off of this thing and Hetfield could do with a guitar tone with just a little more bite to it. Kicking the tempo up a bit might also be nice given that everybody is under the impression that this is supposed to be a return to thrash metal, despite it feeling like a slowed down version of a late 70s Judas Priest song. In other words, this is Metallica trying to be thrash again, but as the great Yoda quote goes, \"Do or do not, there is not try\".\n",
        "\nOn their new single \"Lords of Summer\", Metallica try their very hardest to be the band they were in the '80s. Here, they go through the motions, resurrecting old ideas in tired and hackneyed form. Sure, in terms of schematics, this may be as close to classic Metallica as they have been in a while. However, this sure as hell doesn't have that spark. This still has the sterile production that plagues modern Metallica and it never really treads into territory worth exploring. In the end, this is just a bloated corpse that far overstays its welcome - it tries so hard to be what they used to be, but this really isn't anything but barebones. \n\nPreceding the release of the official single, they put up a \"garage demo\" version of the song. While this sounded pretty shitty, it's still a lot better than this version. The main reason for this is the production is garbage. It's completely sterile, killing the raw and energetic vibe they were hoping for. The riffs here are utterly uninspired and are so obvious and tired that it doesn't even seem like they are even trying. James' vocals seem a bit strained, as if he is getting too old and tired to really be able to put his heart into them anymore. The pathetic excuse for a solo confirms that they are just going through the motions, probably thinking that fans will be too happy that they are reverting back to a thrash sound to notice. It honestly seems like Kirk shat that rehashed tripe out on the spot. Lars' drumming shows that he's an absolute hack behind the kit, but this should come as a surprise to precisely no one. \n\nThe most inexplicable thing about \"Lords of Summer\" is that it's eight minutes long. Obviously, Metallica are no strangers to longer songs, but this has absolutely no rational reason to stretch much further than the four minute mark. Songs like \"Orion\" and \"...and Justice for All\" demanded to be long. This is long, seemingly, just for the hell of it. While castrated thrash in execution, the songwriting draws heavily from textbook rock. It's the type of typical verse-chorus-repeat thing that has no business being stretched out that long. The track ends up being more bloated than Rob Ford after a drunken all-you-can-eat buffet binge. \n\nThis track is disappointing, but not all that surprising. Metallica has been desperately struggling for relevance for a long time, and this is a testament to that. They tried pandering to a more mainstream rock crowd, they tried experimenting, they've tried exhuming the old thrashy corpse - the fact is, they've long outlived their usefulness as a band. Sure, this does bring back some old ideas (there are definitely some discernible nods to Masters of Puppets here and there), but it doesn't do anything with said ideas and just haphazardly regurgitates what we've all heard before done insurmountably better.\n",
        "\nThis album gave me explosive diarrhea, and that's not a joke. I sat late one Friday evening reading through the previous reviews on the infamous Lulu, Metallica's 2011 release. After reading the fifth negative review my curiosity got the better of me; so I went searching, found, and listened to the entire thing. Please don't do the same. What Lulu holds deep within its tainted grasp is a horror only to be powered through by the strong-willed and the deaf. This album somehow surpassed 'Saint Anger' as the worst album ever to be written by these slowly dying musicians. \n\nThis will be a quick review, as I can't be bothered to spend more than a few minutes on the miserable work that is, Lulu.\n\nThis album starts out with the track 'Brandenburg Gate.' After a few randomly strummed chords, the almighty Lou Reed begins mumbling something, and this album's descent into sewage has started. As you lie deep in thought on what this decrepit creature is attempting to say, some poorly recorded power chords kick in. This is followed by an uninspired melody and James Hetfield's half-thrash voice immediately after. As always, Lars Ulrich is right behind these folks pretending to be a drummer, playing the same beat he's played his entire career. This track is like-able however: It causes uncontrollable laughter. Every time James cries out the key line \"small town girl,\" it becomes impossible not to laugh yourself to tears. (Highlight? When Lou Reed blurts \"But me? I'm happy cause I got my little nappy.\" Pretty sure he's talking about having an opiate addiction and the feeling after taking the drugs, but he still actually said \"nappy.\")\n\nDuring the second track, 'The View,' the comedic value has lost it's valor. Be prepared for the most cringe-worthy of all the miserable failures placed on this glorified clump of fecal matter. It begins with Lars banging away a monkey tier beat, probably wondering how he still can't play after thirty-fucking-years behind the kit. Reed continues his pitiful drone, this time taking a fake and \"Deep\" spin with his half-baked spoken word. Lyrically it's not very sense-able, almost as if every word Lou and the gang contributed was uninspired and finely crafted to bend their way around having nothing to actually sing about. Reed will continuously raise his voice's pitch in the middle of some spoken words. This doesn't have the desired, powerful, effect they were going for and it makes the song completely intolerable. The track picks up a couple minutes in where you'll find Kirk Hammett trying to get win back Exodus's hearts, so they'll take him back, by \"shredding\" out a shitty and misplaced solo. There's really not much else to say about this one, just that it's by far the worst. (Highlight? \"I am the table.\")\n\nThe rest of this horrid album follows in line with the first two tracks, so I will not cover each song separately. It's all uninspired dribble. Not just a smudge on Metallica's already stained history, but proof that they need to throw in the towel. This album, granted, was not supposed to be like their other releases, and had meaning to serve other musical purposes. That, however, is not where the issue lies. The issue is that the biggest name in metal music foiled their name further by agreeing to make it. If you are a fan of all the classic Metallica albums, please save yourself and stay as far away from this gutter-muck as you can. Knowing where your childhood shredders went musically, will make you depressed.\n\n2/10\n",
        "\nWith the release of the Lords of Summer, it feels like Metallica are just trying a little too hard, though the results are far better than 'passable,' ironically. While not quite as contrived as the material found on Death Magnetic, Lords of Summer carries not only a similarly muddied production (more on that in a bit), but also the same sense of aimlessness that plagued their 2008 record. This song feels slightly experimental, like Metallica are trying to get a feel for what the fans expect from them. The result is an 8-minute pile of ideas that range from excellent to mediocre and/or bad. \n\n\nLet's get down to the details. Lords of Summer, all in all, is the heaviest and thrashiest song Metallica has written since 1988. The guitar work, first of all, is quite good at parts. The main riff, along with the middle harmonized passage, and the riff at 6:45 all sound adequately powerful. Kirk's solo is decent too, though it needs tweaking. The drumming, surprisingly, manages to propel the song along at a moderate pace without sounding noticeably bad or totally monotonous. Lars is no Gene Hoglan, which is to say he certainly is not and can never be a god, but his fills and footwork aren't totally laughable either. The drums just work. Unfortunately there isn't much to say about Lars' rhythmic counterpart, Rob Trujillo, whose proficient bass is nearly inaudible. Next come James' vocals. For first impressions, I felt like his singing was gruffer and wilder than all his work on Death Magnetic. The whininess found on St. Anger and, to a lesser degree, DM, is completely gone, and a good bit of his grit is back. Lyrically, this song brings back a lot of elements from the Kill 'Em All days as well. \n\n\nThere are several glaring flaws, however. The chief problem is that the song is simply too damn long for it's own good. There are also not enough riffs to fill out the entire 8 minutes and 20 seconds. To compensate for this, James and Kirk repeat the riffs in order to maintain the song structure, mostly at the cost of my patience. The production is another problem. It lacks the punch of their 80's material, though it's not quite as bad as the production of DM and St. Anger. The guitars just don't have the right kind of distortion or tone that belong in thrash metal. However, it's important to keep in mind that this is a simple demo song of sorts, and shouldn't be entirely judged as a finished product. Metallica appear to be interested in writing thrash metal again, which I'd say is a good thing, though it remains to be seen if they can actually pull it off with the competence of their early 80's records. Good luck to them.\n",
        "\nSo after 3 years Metallica has finally released some new content. And I must say, it does not disappoint! Sure, it's not Progressive and epic like Master Of Puppets or AFJA, but it has energy and passion not seen since Kill 'Em All. The song is quite good! It's a thrashy and youthful track. It's sort of a cross between Kill 'Em All and The infamous Black Album. The one thing about this song that annoys me most is that it's too damn long! Seriously, they need to trim it a little! Metallica has always been great with long songs (Ex. Disposable Heroes, Creeping Death, Master Of Puppets, Ride The Lightning, And Justice For All) but this one drags on a tad bit too long. Aside from that, I have been very supportive of where Metallica has been going with their music ever since Death Magnetic (Despite what others say, Death Magnetic was amazing, but that's a whole other story.)\n\nAbout the song itself, James Hetfield's rhythm playing is phenomenal like it has always been, and the riffs are powerful and memorable, (Especially that main riff!). Lars' playing is basic as always, but nonetheless effective, Kirk's leads aren't the best, but they still are quite good and enjoyable, and (sadly) Robert Trujillo's bass has been sidelined. Seriously, what does Metallica have against their bassists?? You can almost never hear the bass on any of Metallica's albums (even with Cliff!!) I still prefer Death Magnetic and the Beyond Magnetic EP over this track, however. I hope this marks Metallica's true return to form (As much as I loved Death Magnetic, it lacked a certain few things), a true return to form like Slayer's World Painted Blood or Megadeth's Endgame.\n\nAll in all, I can't wait to hear their new album (Which is taking them too long to make, stop touring and get your asses in the studio!!).\n",
        "\nWe've heard it all before. We always complain about what bands sold out with certain albums, and nowhere is this more evident than with Metallica and their so-called \"black album\". Actually, it's an album with many different opinions. Some actually say that it's Metallica's magnum opus while others loathe it to the nth degree. My opinion? It's definitely not the worst case of Def Leppard's Disease I've ever heard. I've heard horn sections in a Raven album (\"The Pack is Back\"), and I've heard synthesizers make sweet love songs (ex. Def Leppard's \"Love Bites\"), so \"Metallica\" really is nothing compared to any of those. Still, it's a sign that the band wanted to be more accessible to the public, and they've made some dramatic changes in their music to do so. \n\nWe all know that when Metallica recorded this album, it was unlike anything they had released before. Their time signatures are slowed down almost completely, thus turning off a lot of fans. Sure, \"Through the Never\" is kind of a fast, driving song, but most purists would say that it's definitely not fast enough to satisfy them. While it is true that the songs aren't as rapid as we hoped they would be, they still have kind of that same edge that Metallica had when Cliff was around. The riffs, while they aren't as complex as before, still consist of those sharp, aggressive power chords that the band had used throughout their career. The infamous \"Load\" albums that came afterwords wouldn't contain so much of those crunching power chords found on the \"Black Album\". This shows that while Metallica showed signs of selling out, they haven't abandoned their roots completely (yet). There's also the fact that the guitars are pretty heavy, even for this album.\n\nSome proof of that comes in the form of \"Through the Never\", which, like I said, is a pretty driving song. In fact, it just might be the fastest track on the album. With that fact aside, it's an example of a song that's got the crunching power chords and a little bit of that driving speed that we all know and love still keeps the spirit of Metallica. \"Enter Sandman\" and \"Of Wolf and Man\" have those crunching power chords as well, yet their tempos are slower than \"Through the Never\". The slower tempos may upset many purists, but in reality, the riffs in, say, \"Of Wolf and Man\", are really not that different from the riffs that Metallica had come up with in the past. If the songs were to be changed in any way, all that you would need to do is speed up the tempo and add a chugging e-note rhythm. Even though they are mid-paced, I really don't consider them to be that huge of a deal, cos Metallica has done at least one song with aggressive power chords that isn't so blindingly fast. One example of that is \"The Thing that Should Not Be\" from \"Master of Puppets\". \n\nIt must be said that in order for Metallica to make their self-titled effort to be friendly to the public, they also ditched their more political lyrical themes found on their preceding albums in favor of writing of various things. These new lyrical themes ranged from the sublime (\"The God that Failed\" being about James Hetfield's feelings towards religion due to his mother's passing) to the ridiculous (\"Nothing Else Matters\" being just another love song). In particular, \"Nothing Else Matters\" would be the only thing about the black album that I would have to complain about, other than the fact that somebody must have put crazy glue on Kirk Hammett's wah-wah. That is simply cos of the fact that it's a love song, something completely new to the world of Metallica. The band is no stranger to ballads, (\"Fade to Black\" being the best example), but since it has to be a love song, the lyrics also have to be quite pretentious. I also find the theme of werewolves in \"Of Wolf and Man\" to be a little silly as well.\n\nThe lyrical themes and slower tempos prove that this album is not perfect, while the crunching power chords and somewhat aggressive riffs prove that this album is not a complete disaster. Is this the most magnificent work Metallica has ever completed? No. Is this the absolute worst thing that could happen to Metallica? No. Is it an album that is at least good or bad to some extent? Yes. I know it sounds hard to believe, but, despite its shortcomings, the black album is not a horrendous album. It may seem mediocre at times, and I do consider \"Ride the Lightning\" to be a far superior album, but it is by no means \"St. Anger\". I would consider it somewhere in between the two aforementioned albums, so I am not defending it nor am I slamming it. It's different, but it's an album I really don't consider losing my head over, whether my opinions are positive or negative.\n",
        "\nAlright\u2026 so there\u2019s something new from the Metallica camp. Yup, grumbles and sighs abound \u2013 the ageing bastards are still trying to come up with something decent since the release of \u2026And Justice For All. They\u2019ve had their moments here and there since then, and I\u2019m not one of those people who absolutely abhor their self-titled album \u2013 I just find it really quite boring. And boring is pretty much the word to describe this single release, Lords of Summer.\n\nWhat\u2019s on offer here is a single track that\u2019s over eight minutes long \u2013 and boy is it a long eight minutes. Gone are the days of Metallica keeping lengthy songs interesting with constantly changing riffs and some light-heavy shades offering some slight variation. This is about as one-dimensional as it gets. Trying to return to their thrash roots for a while now, Metallica has miserably failed to even compete with the weaker lot of the recent old school thrash revival bands. There are probably a thousand bedroom thrash bands writing better songs than this slab of plodding sick.\n\nFrom what I understand, a live version was made public a few months ago, and this is now the band\u2019s 'studio' representation of the song... it's supposed to be more of a demo, but these guys are hardly recording on a 4-track Fostex. Metallica has supposedly been trying to produce their recordings in a rawer, stripped-down fashion recently and all those years of ruining their hearing playing live have paid off \u2013 they can no longer hear the difference between \u2018raw\u2019 and shit. The production is completely flat and sounds as if it hasn\u2019t even been mastered; it\u2019s completely sterile. At least Lars\u2019 drums sound okay for a change and Hetfield\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t quite as pathetic as you\u2019d expect at this point, though providing a chuckle here and there, and there\u2019s one decent riff that pops up later in the song\u2026 but that\u2019s it: those are the only selling points of this release.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of this single, then? Today, having access to resources like YouTube, etc. where you can hear the live versions of songs like these, this single is about as pointless and depressing as a Lars Ulrich drum solo \u2013 it simply serves as an indication of a band having regressed to the point of barely being able to play with any intent or creativity (or in Kirk Hammet\u2019s case, simply being able to play). It may not be as bad as Lulu, an album upon which I take a figurative shit, but avoid this piece of crap like an Aids-infected junkie\u2019s heroin needle. \u2018Lords of Summer\u2019, by its utter mediocrity, is one of the most offensive things I\u2019ve heard this year.\n",
        "\nThis album is ground-breaking as it has been called the first album of the thrash/speed metal movement. This statement can be debated, but it is a very early thrash/speed metal album indeed. Yes, there had been demos before with this sound, even the band Stress from Brazil claim to have preceded this album with their debut studio album in 1982 titled \"Stress\". Even if that is true, this album was the match to the fuse for American speed and thrash metal. There is good reason for that statement. Let me go into detail and explain this.\n\nThis is a speed metal album with thrashy parts. The speed is what really catches anyone from the start. Next, the crunchy and ripping guitar tones make this almost automatically heavier than any predecessor (excluding maybe Venom and Motorhead). The guitars are also extremely catchy at points with songs like The Fourhorse Men, No Remorse, Whiplash, Etc. No band up until this point had this sort of mix. The solos are both easy to listen to and technical. They are not too special but they defiantly get the job done here. \n\nThis album has some great lyrics in songs like The Fourhorse Men, Jump in the Fire, Seek & Destroy and Phantom Lord. They all speak of some sort of mayhem or pain and devastation. This sets a frenzied mood in the lyrics for the whole album. \n\nThe vocals add to the heaviness with James Hetfield going from whiny vocals reminiscent of the N.W.O.B.H.M. bands they adore and aspired to be like, to gruff and crude barks in the style of Cronos of Venom and Lemmy from Motorhead. Almost every song on this album has the two different styles displayed within the first 2 verses and chorus of each song. The vocals are very well delivered in general. Most phrasing feel comfortable and catchy.\n\nThe bass is handled by none other than Cliff Burton, a monster on the bass. Unfortunately, the bass is lower in the mix than most would prefer. Though Cliff gets his spotlight on the track (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth. Where he plays a full on bass solo. This being a rare occurrence on any album. The bass tone on this album is created with Cliff's extremely warm sounding wah pedal tone. It makes the bass fit perfectly under the guitars on this album. Though this makes the bass hard to distinguish at times sadly.\n\nThe drums are the one weak link in this principally perfect chain of instrumentals and vocals. Lars does a very basic job here. He doesn't add much to the band on this album. His drum work is fast but it is mainly regular N.W.O.B.H.M. drums on steroids, nothing really innovative here. He was just getting used to drums at this point, as the next 3 albums by Metallica have excellent drumming through out. There are no really big highlights for Lars on this album. Though he does a pretty good job at catchy drums on Whiplash.\n\nThis album overall is short when listened to but it clocks in at approx. 51 minutes. This is a 10-track album that feels like it is only 5 tracks because of how exciting it feels. There is barely a second to breath. Which makes this album a worth listening to a lot more than once. This is a amazingly telling debut. It has elements that Metallica would use a fair bit through out the eighties. It is not too amateurish to make you feel like these are just a bunch of songs written to sound \"heavy and fast\" for the sake of being so. It is mainly technical and fast with a feeling of a adrenaline rush through out. This album is around 31 years old but it has aged well for a speed/thrash album. I would defiantly recommend it to any metal-head as it is a necessity in thrash and a classic of metal in general.\n",
        "\nThis is obvious a classic to most metal-heads. This album is almost perfection in metal summed up in one album. Though to say it is a perfect album would be a slight overstatement. Yes it is a classic but that does mean it's flawless. I will explain in detail.\n\nThis is Metallica's sophomore release. They have obviously progressed from Kill em' All which was a more 'punch to the throat' thrash blitz of an album. This album is the perfect blend of the speed and assault from Kill em' All mixed with the technical and melodic interludes of Master of Puppets. Two other great releases from Metallica.\n\nJames' vocal performance here is melodic in parts, especially with the track \"Fade to Black\" and the all too underrated \"Escape\". Though almost everywhere else on this album they are just testosterone-fueled screeches and barks that come across as booming at times and make the songs sound heavy as all fuck. James' guitar work is also extremely tight and proficient. All the riffs he plays rhythm-wise are heavy, speaker destroying and filled with some of the most catchy hooks in thrash metal. Most of these riffs like the ones in Creeping Death, the title track, Trapped Under Ice, and For Whom the Bell Tolls are just classic and are all out booming.\n\nKirk brings in a nice technical side with the very casual solos and fretwork he brings to the table. The solos aren't too overbearing and technical to the point where they ruin the songs but they are just technical enough to show the progression that is very apparent on this album. Kirk really shows that he can be a amazing solo guitarist at times when it is needed most. He has gone from the newbie to the band on Kill 'em All to being a somewhat seasoned solo guitarist on this album and hardly a note from him is awkward or out right useless.\n\nCliff's bass is the usual Cliff Burton playing style of just playing exactly what the guitars are playing, with a few scattered pieces of solo playing and technical bass lines that vary away from some of the guitar chords. This is perfect for what is needed bass-wise, although a \"(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth\" part 2 would've been interesting to hear for sure. He makes the opening of songs like For Whom the Bell Tolls and Ride the Lightning interesting but overall on this record, Cliff is being good ol' Cliff.\n\nLars' drums sound almost dead-on for the tone of this album. They are groovy and hooky enough to make the rhythm of the album progress perfectly with James' rhythm guitar and Cliff's bass guitar but are some what lack-luster in technicality and emotion. Lar's provides the loud, bombastic drums but he seems robotic and detached at times. Not bad overall but not the most impressive drumming he has done (cough, cough... ... And Justice for All). He has obviously progressed from the basic beats on Kill 'em All, so I will give him major props for that fact.\n\nAll the songs presented here are instant hits. They are all up to snuff for what a metal album or thrash album is expected to present. They have pounding and ear shattering double-kick drums that are not too shabby (for what Lars' drumming not sounds like), the guitar tone overall is heavy, chugging and in your face from beginning to end, the bass is finger-picked and set more to the back but just audible enough to give a great groove and hook to each song as Cliff was known for that, and the lyrics are about death, sorrow, agony, and destruction. This is basically a piece of thrash gold. My opinion is that it is a great albums but not a perfect album.\n\nThe last thing to mention here is the outstandingly clean and tight production done by none other then Flemming Rasmussen. The mix is perfectas no instrument overbears another and every drum beat and guitar riff is 100% audible (unlike some thrash albums that sound like they were mixed in the 5 minutes after the recording was done). This is defiantly how a album of this speed and heaviness should be produced and mixed. To see albums back then and now sounding not even half as good as this album with huge budgets for producing and mixing compared to this album's budget is just astounding. This is what all thrash bands now-a-days should shoot for production-wise on their albums cause if they did then I would never have to listen to the drums be the loudest things to ever grace a CD or any other instrument completely hogging the volume on a album.\n\nNow, moving on. Here are my top tracks from this album. First off is Ride the Lightning, this song is a top track for me because the bass and guitar in the opening are just catchy as all fuck. The drums are great too. The lyrics are perfect. They tell of a prisoner on death row about to meet his death by the electric chair. This songs puts you in a \"headbang and destroy your room mood\" but also just feels so self-destructive. It is a perfect song overall. My other favorite song off this album is one of Metallica's fastest and it kicks fucking ass. This opener to the album starts with the elegant acoustic guitars that then lead into the wall of \"Fuck You\" that this downward spiral of a song truly is. It is just full on fury from start to end. The apocalyptic lyrics themes and the chugging riffs make this one motherfucker of a song, that's for sure. To say these songs are bad while being a Metallica fan (casual or die-hard) is just ridiculous. So here you go. This is my review of Metallica's Ride the Lightning. \n\nTo conclude this review. Here are my favorite and least favorite track from this album.\n\nFavorites:\n-Ride the Lightning\n-Fight Fire with Fire\n\n(Reasons mentioned above)\nLeast favorites:\n-Fade to Black: because it is just kinda watered down and breaks the flow of the album completely in two.\n-Escape: because it is a random break off from the other songs on this album and it messes up the flow of the album and just doesn't do it for me.\n",
        "\nAfter thrash metal milestones such as \u201cKill\u2019em All\u201d, \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d and \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, more progressive outputs with a few groove metal tendencies as on \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d, a commercially flavoured and highly successful record with \u201cMetallica\u201d, experimental southern rock records as on \u201cLoad\u201d and \u201cReLoad\u201d, a passionate outburst of aggression on \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, a return to the thrash metal roots with a modern touch as on \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d and an experimental minimalist concept album with LOU REED entitled \u201cLulu\u201d, the world\u2019s most famous metal band Metallica tries out something new again. This time, it\u2019s a movie entitled \u201cThrough the Never\u201d where a weird plot is connected to the lyrics of several famous Metallica tracks.\n\nThis record is the soundtrack of this film and was recorded live in the Canadian cities of Edmonton and Vancouver in August 2012. The funny thing with this band is that they didn\u2019t release any live records for many years apart of the \u201cS&M\u201d project where the band was accompanied by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen. But during the last five years, the band released eight live records on DVD or CD. This here is number nine. Even though most of the records are great, one really doesn\u2019t need all of these outputs. Some people claim that \u201cThrough the Never\u201d is the best among these live releases. I think this is not true. I found \u201cOrgullo, Pasion Y Gloria - Tres Noches En La Ciudad de Mexico\" more passionate and the set lists of the two \u201cSix Feet Down Under\u201d EPs definitely more appealing.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that this record is bad. It\u2019s an energetic and unpolished live document. Nothing seems to have been changed on this record. You still hear a rather weird bass guitar and electric guitar sound in the beginning of \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d, the micro problems in the middle of \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d and the sudden sound problems at the end of \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d. While all of this sounds authentic, I\u2019m asking myself why the band didn\u2019t chose better versions of these songs as they had played two nights in Edmonton and even three nights in Vancouver where they could have picked the best version of each song.\n\nOn the other side, you get blown away by the powerful opener \u201cCreeping Death\u201d where the crowd already goes insane. The live rendition of \u201cThe Memory Remains\u201d is by far the best version of this song as it convinces with a more direct, emotional and honest approach. The moving guitar introduction makes even a predictable and used ballad like \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d sound fresh. In addition to this, a few of my favorite Metallica songs such as \u201cOne\u201d or \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d are also included in excellent renditions on here. The band really did a great job.\n\nThe only thing I really didn\u2019t need is the weird live in studio rerecording of \u201cOrion\u201d that doesn\u2019t equal the original. On the other side, I would like to hear such an edgy studio sound on the next regular studio record instead of the overproduced loudness war on \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d. I might also add that the set list of the Canadian shows included a few amazing tracks that didn\u2019t make it on the final record without any particular reason such as \u201cSad But True\u201d, \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d or \u201cSeek And Destroy\u201d. It\u2019s also sad that the band didn\u2019t include a song from each record they have made as \u201cSt. Anger\u201d and \u201cLulu\u201d are missing and despite their negative reputation, both are undeniably parts of Metallica's history.\n\nIn the end, one doesn\u2019t really need a new Metallica live record or this movie. The previous live outputs from all around the world were at least as good as the performances on here. I prefer to sit at home and get blown away by the \u201cLive Shit: Binge and Purge\u201d release or the already legendary \u201cThe Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria\u201d output where I even get some additional great performances by Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer. This record is only for truly faithful fans, those who have been there in Edmonton or Vancouver when Metallica played there, enthusiastic teenagers discovering the metal scene as a popcorn event and die hard completionists.\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Observer\n",
        "\n\u201e\u2026And Justice For All\u201c is my favourite Metallica record along with the thrash metal milestone \u201eRide The Lightning\u201c and the controversial, desperate and pitiless \u201cSt. Anger\u201d. The song writing, innovation and intensity are different from the other two releases but as impressive in my humble opinion. Obviously, this record also has a strong disadvantage many people have already pointed out: the production. The sound is too clinical and the bass guitar is nearly inaudible. Yes, this approach gives the band sound a completely new style, it makes the final result unique and fits to the sinister lyrics. On the other side, a more natural sound would have added given more power instead which I would have preferred over the constantly angry atmosphere it incarnates. This is one of the rare cases where I would support a completely re-mastered version of the original. Otherwise, one may enjoy many songs on several outstanding live records and I would give the band the advice to play the full album in concert and release it as a double-disc version for their fans so that everyone can finally perfectly enjoy the material. Personally, this irritating production issue doesn\u2019t bother me enough though to ignore the nine excellent songs on this release.\n\nMetallica went away from the straight sound of the two first albums and also from the more melodic side of the predecessor. The band offers instead more challenging and slightly progressive song writing with technically improved musicianship, extended instrumental parts and many powerful breakdowns with two songs nearly hitting the ten minute mark. The vocals are maybe more emotional and still technically appealing than ever, the drum sound is drier than usual, the riffs may sound repetitive but are always effective and I especially like the few colourful melodic guitar solos that lighten up rather dark songs as \u201cThe Shortest Straw\u201d for example.\n\nAt the same time, the stronger use of mid-tempo riffs and more versatile vocals that vary from calm clean passages over angry and slightly uncontrolled screams to a few vocal effects makes this record an often ignored prototype of the controversial groove metal genre that would become popular a few years after with releases by Exhorder, Fear Factory, Machine Head, Pantera, Prong and Sepultura. A good example for the use of more modern mid-tempo riffs and vocal effects is portrayed in \u201cEye Of The Beholder\u201d while the fusion of a calm half ballad approach that slowly shifts towards a more destructive sound with angrily shouted vocals can best be heard in the lyrically intriguing \u201cOne\u201d which is maybe the best and probably the most atmospheric song Metallica ever wrote. The quasi-instrumental \u201cTo Live Is To Die\u201d hits a similar vein and has a great and coherent progression which makes this track one of my favourite instrumental songs ever. The menacing guitar sound, the tight and precise drum play and the pissed-off vocals in the first single \u201cHarvester Of Sorrow\u201d also perfectly represent the style of this record. \n\nIt\u2019s somehow ironical that this uncompromising record that is a lot less approachable than the first three outputs in my opinion would hit the charts and pave the path to worldwide commercial success for the band. Those who seriously claim that Metallica would flirt with mainstream on this album must be deaf as the opposite is the case. After the tragic death of their bass player Cliff Burton the band simply had to release this desperate sixty-five minutes of music as much as the liberating \u201cSt. Anger\u201d fifteen years later after years of internal disputes and growing pressure. This band seems to work best when put under pressure. I must admit that this album has a very own and special mood which makes this release so controversial. Sometimes I enjoy this record a little bit less but when I\u2019m in the right mood I definitely dig it and am close to consider it as the best output the band may have released. This record is not for everyone. Old school thrash metal fans might only like the powerful opener \u201cBlackened\u201d, the vivid \u201cThe Frayed Eyes Of Sanity\u201d and the fast closer \u201cDyers Eve\u201d which consistently grew on me. Fans of the later and more commercial years will appreciate \u201cOne\u201d as well as \u201cHarvester Of Sorrow\u201d but could fail to make it through the even longer songs on this release. In my opinion, this release is though one of Metallica\u2019s most emotional, groundbreaking and technically stunning albums for those who like both Metallica\u2019s early and later days. In the end, this groove metal prototype is better than anything the real genre would ever manage to release.\n",
        "\nMetallica\u2019s \u201cSt. Anger\u201c has been reviewed so many times, so what\u2019s the matter to do this all over again? My reasoning is simple. Usually, this controversial record is hated by many and adored by a few. There seems to be nothing in between and this release still divides the masses as only few metal albums will ever do. My point is that I initially hated this album but I adore it a lot today.\n\nLet me explain. When I got into metal music back in 2005, I stumbled over many great current records of the most famous bands. When a friend introduced me to \u201cSt. Anger\u201d I thought it was stupidly aggressive, annoyingly noisy and endlessly repetitive. This album didn\u2019t include anything I was looking for back then. I was looking for a catchier single, some emotional guitar solos, an epic or progressive surprise here and there, a touching ballad or maybe a song with sophisticated lyrics. This album includes none of these things. I decided to listen to other stuff from Metallica and I found many records quite mellow as well. For me, Metallica was the most overrated metal band in the world. When I gave the band another chance after the release of the solid \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d in 2008, I started to dig some of the band\u2019s earlier records but I didn\u2019t listen to that \u201cSt. Anger\u201d abomination again because I only had bad memories of it. It\u2019s only back in 2011 when I coincidentally listened to that album again when I introduced a friend of mine to the metal world. At that point, I knew much more about the tensions in the band prior to the release of \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, my English had become better and I spent some time to analyze the lyrics of this record and my personal tastes had expanded and become much more open-minded towards extreme (sounding) metal. Suddenly, something had changed and I started to appreciate \u201cSt. Anger\u201d to my own surprise.\n\nThis album transports so many extreme emotions that go straight in your face: it\u2019s full of anger, black humor, cynicism, fear, frustration, pain, pressure, social criticism and spite. It\u2019s an unvarnished drain valve, an authentic still life, the handle after the last straw. It was an uncompromising make it or break it release created with tons of burden and pressure six years after the band\u2019s last release. It was an album that would see Metallica die or survive. It was the kind of album that the band simply had to do no matter what while the previous records had always aimed for a mainstream audience. The band didn\u2019t give a damn about the question if this album was going to please the critics and fans or not at all. All these negative emotions the band gathered over the years culminated on this release which makes this record absolutely authentic, gripping and unique to me. This album absolutely has to sound raw and dirty. Guitar solos are too beautiful for the negative lyrical topics on here. The repetitive, down-tuned, chugging riffs perfectly represent the never-ending hell the band was going through. The tinny, dirty, annoying drum sound is perfectly in context because it\u2019s as annoying as ripping headaches and negative thoughts that won\u2019t ever leave you. The aggressive and sometimes out-of-tone vocals and the respective lyrics feel like the desperate rant of an insane mind. Yes, this album has a very special atmosphere and it sounds completely unique. It\u2019s an album for special moments when you simply feel mad about something and want to reduce your aggression or when you are in need for some uncompromising and straight music. People tend to compare \u201cSt. Anger\u201d to other stuff and cite nu-metal bands (pejoratively called mallcore by the closed-minded elitists) like System Of A Down or Limp Bizkit. Those who say so just didn\u2019t understand \u201cSt. Anger\u201d or they simply don\u2019t want to. Both bands never wrote eight-minute long repetitive and desperate rants with down-tuned instruments and extremely raw productions anyway. It took me more than half a decade to realize this and respect this raw diamond.\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to pick out any song on here because \u201cSt. Anger\u201d really works as a whole. Let me just say that I started to love the songs I really hated in the beginning. \u201cSome Kind Of Monster\u201d had always sounded way too long, repetitive and unnecessarily brutal to my ears when I was young but today I literally feel the menacing main riff and dig the angry lyrics. Another good example is \u201cMy World\u201d which sounded aimless to me in the beginning but today I definitely understand this track that perfectly represents the spirit of Metallica back then. It\u2019s their world and it\u2019s a mad world and if you don\u2019t like it and want to dig in the past, than get along, suckers! The extremely aggressive \u201cPurify\u201d felt like pointless brutality to my ears when I was young but today I consider it as maybe the most concise song writing on this record where Metallica literally try to purify itself.\n\nNote that the songs that I initially liked have become even greater as time went by. I might cite the pitiless opener \u201cFrantic\u201d where the vocals sound like a ticking time bomb and where the tinny drum sound and simplistic riffs perfectly introduce us to what this record is all about. The desperate \u201cThe Unnamed Feeling\u201d that mixes hysterical passages with menacingly calm and almost mantra-like parts is my favourite song on the album. It feels like the individual that tells the story desperately tries to keep control but in the end completely looses it in the middle part of the song.\n\nEverything about this album suddenly works. The riffs are chugging and simplistic but that\u2019s why they work so well. The raw drums that were mixed in the foreground represent that hammering in your head that is suffering from a severe migraine. The drum play is straight but incredibly effective. Metallica\u2019s drummer gets regularly criticized but I think he did the best job of his career on this album because and not despite he lacks diversity, elegance and technique. It simply fits on this particular record while his drum play might slightly spoil other Metallica records. The vocalist simply sings his heart out with slightly hysterical and imperfectly perfect vocals. Yes, there is a lot of \u201cuh!\u201d and \u201cyeah!\u201d on this album and these elements sounded out of place and mildly amusing on other albums but on here, these initial flaws have become strengths as they sound unpolished, natural and honest. The singer doesn\u2019t think about how he should perform, it feels as if he just lets himself go and that\u2019s what was needed for this release. Oh yes, there is also a bass player on this record but he wasn\u2019t really needed on here and that\u2019s why the unimpressive bass play simply doesn\u2019t matter to me even though I usually adore this instrument. This is James Hetfield\u2019s, Lars Ulrich\u2019s and Kirk Hammett\u2019s most personal record. Jason Newsted is a nice guy but never really fitted into this band anyway and session bassist Bob Rock was just there to fill in for the least important spot in the band.\n\nIf I had written a review for this album back in 2005 or the years after, I would have given this album an utterly bad grade. Today, it\u2019s close to perfection for me. I only cut off a few points because the record doesn\u2019t work in all situations as you have to be in a very particular mood to get into this and because \u201cSweet Amber\u201d is the only song I never got into on this release. It sounds like the rest but in a less convincing manner as it\u2019s neither outthought enough to grab our attention nor straight enough to conquer us by all means. \n\nIn the end, I would like to suggest you to give this album a fair chance from time to time. Maybe you will be going through the same experience as I did and deeply appreciate what you profoundly hated one day. Just listen to this record once or twice every two or three years. If it doesn\u2019t work, put it away and try again two or three years later. Maybe you need a special event in your own life to dig this vulgar negativity of an album like the loss of a job, the death of a beloved friend or a complicated divorce. Or maybe you are just like me and you will look beyond this album and empathise with the band and its particular situation back in the days so that this record suddenly makes sense. Anyway, such a timelessly controversial album should be known by any metal fan. If it\u2019syou\u2019re your case, discover the madness right now! Even if you hate it, your listening experience might be more interesting than the discovery of many so-called classics that didn\u2019t age so well.\n",
        "\nWhere do you begin with this? Its a subject that has been covered over and over again, time after time for over 20 years now. The fact remains that \"Justice\" is a strongly polarizing album, one of the most polarizing in all of metal. Many people outright dislike it because of the production. I've always been able to ignore that aspect, and even grow to like it. The same is true of the songs themselves. One side of the fence proclaims it to be their most technically accomplished moment, the other side's opinion being that a lot of it goes on for far longer than it needs to. I can relate to both viewpoints, however this has most likely always been my favourite Metallica album. \n\nObviously, we all know about the circumstances that led the way to this album being the way it is. Cliff Burton's untimely death in late 1986 dealt a crippling blow to Metallica, stopping their original creative train dead in its tracks, and really they never quite recovered from it. It would seem that the tragedy of his death fueled this album, because they are PISSED here. James' vocals were never so angry sounding, and to achieve the desired aggressiveness the drums had to be recorded in sections to maintain consistency, as Lars was apparently hitting them so hard. The lyrics are the darkest yet. They had covered such things as abuse of power and corruption before, but on this album that's the overriding theme. Injustice, discrimination and environmental themes are also heavily touched upon. Naturally a replacement for Burton had to be found, and Jason Newsted was recruited from thrashers Flotsam and Jetsam. He was given a trial run (not to mention some volume) on the 1987 \"Garage Days\" covers EP where he cut his teeth finely and proved he was just as good a bassist (if not as wildly creative, then arguably tighter as a musician) as Burton was. \n\nNow, this issue of the production. The album has a very strange (for the time, techniques used on this record would later become commonplace in extreme metal), very scooped sound where the guitars are largely all bass and treble, with not very much mids at all. The bass guitar track was reduced in volume considerably, and subsequently swallowed up by the scooped guitars. The drums are much drier than any of their previous albums, as is the overall mix. The sound is quite a shock the first time you hear it, especially coming to it from the much fuller sounding previous albums. However, despite the hailstorm of production complaints that regularly gets thrown at this album, I've always found it suits the feel of the music. Even the unfortunate lack of bass (and it really is unfortunate, having heard the original bass tracks made louder I can tell you they're very good and its a damn shame the guy was buried so much) adds to the feel of it. The second of the main criticisms of \"Justice\" is the songwriting. The grinding, repetitive nature of some of the songs (most notably the 11 minute title track) can be a turn off to some listeners. Personally I don't have a problem with it, though after the amount of times I've heard the album I admit I do have to be in the mood for some of it. Many of this album's tracks regularly find their way into Metallica fan's (including mine) favourite songs, Harvester of Sorrow, the relentless Blackened, and of course One - a song that broke new ground for the band with its brilliantly executed video, and despite how overplayed it is the fact remains that its a stone cold classic, and one of the album's highlights. Other favourites of mine include the steady, mechanical grinding of Eye of the Beholder, and the more adventurous and lengthy compositions like the title track and Frayed Ends of Sanity which show Metallica fully embracing the progressive tendencies that \"Puppets\" had hinted at. Then of course, the only instrumental of theirs that gives Orion a good run for its money in my mind. \n\nThis was Metallica's last go at what could be called \"real\" thrash - we all know what happened next. Despite its perceived faults, the success of \"Justice\" paved the way for them to fully conquer the world 2 years later with the massive selling self titled album. Despite the fact that the Black album toned down the apparent excess of \"Justice\" resulting in shorter, more concise and more successful songs - it isn't half as creative or adventurous as this album. Listen to this to hear their creative peak.\n",
        "\nGet it? Because the album is called Ride the Lightning and there's an electric chair? Aah nevermind...\n\n\nThis is the band's second studio effort and I believe the last one to have any writing contributions from former guitarist and Megadeth mastermind Dave Mustaine. It shows the band writing more complex but equally fast material to Kill Em All. The band sacrifice none of the heaviness yet also expand their sound, with some acoustic guitars that are used very well. Listeners will no doubt be in for a treat.\n\n\nThe acoustic guitars are heard primarily in \"Fight Fire With Fire\" (the opening track, AND right at the start. Metallica be trollin'), \"Fade To Black\" and instrumental \"The Call of Ktulu\". However, these are still heavy songs, so at no point does it feel as though the thrash element of Metallica is lacking on this album (it's the later albums listeners want to be worried about. Ha!), and in fact, I consider \"Fade to Black\" to be one of my favourite Metallica songs. The subject matter is very dark, and concerns a man giving up and ending his life. It was very gutsy of the band to tackle such a topic so early on in their career, but nearly 30 years later, the world is glad that they did.\n\n\nThe lyrics on Ride the Lightning also deal with deathly and apocalyptic themes. \"Fight Fire With Fire\" concerns nuclear weaponary and how it destroys hundreds of innocent lives (the bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for example) and the title track poses the question of whether death is a suitable punishment regardless of the crime, and is told from the viewpoint of a man awaiting his death sentence in the electric chair. The subject matter is consistently powerful and shows that Metallica were certainly not to be underestimated. This was a young band with something to say.\n\n\nOther classics on the album include the epic \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", \"Trapped Under Ice\" and \"Creeping Death\". \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" especially is up there with Metallica's greatest songs. The bass effects as well as the evil sounding guitar riffs make it an absolute treat to listen to. \"Trapped Under Ice\" is one of the faster paced songs on the album and is standard thrash fare with a small sprinkling of melody and a sing/shout-along chorus (\"Escape\" has the same ingredients though it is slower).\n\n\nRide the Lightning contains many of Metallica's greatest moments, and should be cherished by any fan of the band. The band play like their lives depend on it. This album establishes them as a rising force, and, although many of their later albums have divided fans and critics, they will always be a popular touring entity no matter what. Why, you ask? Well, it's because fans want to hear songs from early albums like Ride the Lightning regardless of what they think of Load, ReLoad, St. Anger or Lulu. It's an album that everyone can agree on. That alone should prove the album's legacy. If you consider yourself a metal fan and you've yet to hear Ride the Lightning, then do it! Preferably sometime before you die.\n",
        "\nMetallica need no introduction, so i won't do one. Basically, when i first got into metal Metallica were one of the main bands i was into along with Iron Maiden. Probably the same for most people. Sometimes we grow out of music from our youth, not the case with this album. The album everyone goes on about is Master of Puppets, but i've always felt that Ride the Lightning blows MoP away on almost every level. It is not only a genre defining classic of thrash, but of metal in general. On a side note i also think it's a cool album just because it came out the year i was born! This was also the last album to feature songwriting contributions from Dave Mustaine and his input is definitely of a high standard for the 2 tracks he co-wrote.\n\n'Fight Fire With Fire' starts things off with a gentle acoustic intro, a trick the band would use to introduce 'Battery' on the next album. Nice thrashy track, even has some fast double bass drum pounding from Lars (in those days he was actually a shit hot drummer). Next we have the title track (just like on Master of Puppets). The solo on this track is lengthy and amazing, and the track has some fantastic riffs. 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' follows and is an absolute classic, featuring THAT bass intro! great song, not really thrash but instantly memorable. 'Fade to Black', the first Metallica ballad, is also a classic despite what the purists may say. Kirk's solos are dazzling, the only thing wrong with this track is the shitty production. Listen to a live version and Lars is hammering the bass drums at the end, but barely audible on the album version, shame. \n\nThe second half of the album starts with 2 slightly lesser tracks, both are still very good though. 'Trapped Under Ice' is pure thrash, while 'Escape' is more mid-paced. At the end we have the mighty 'Creeping Death' (still a live favourite) and the instrumental epic closer 'The Call of Ktulu'. The first of these is just a brilliant thrash track, while the latter shows off the band members' sublime instrumental abilities. Not a weak track among the 8 on this album.\n\nNow i kept comparing this to Master of Puppets. I've always felt MoP just followed the same blueprint as RtL, even the style of the respective tracks from 1-8 is the same with the exception of the last 2 being reversed (i.e 'Orion' and 'Call...' being instrumentals). This album is simply more original and also stronger overall and will always be my favourite Metallica album. The only downside is the slightly poor production which i think would be improved by a full remix/remastering, preferably not by Rick Rubin or one of his minions! It's mainly the drums that need brightening up on a few tracks, no problems with the guitars or bass. If only Hetfield could still sing like this too! His best set of lyrics are perfect for his youthful, raspy bark. None of that singing or yodelling nonsense here!\n\nIn summary, a classic. The absolute best this band would ever do, yet sort of overlooked in their back catalogue. Amazing riffs, great solos, powerful drumming, awesome bass, cool vocals, thoughtful lyrics and above all else, amazing songwriting! if you don't own this you don't deserve the power of hearing!!!\n\nRecommended: Every track, just buy the damn album\n",
        "\nFrom my observations of other reviews, and comments, both on the internet and interpersonally, a lot of things can affect how you feel about this band. From when/how you started listening to them, to what other music you like. What your friends think about em and how douchey you heard the band members are. I feel my perspective is much less biased. There has to be some bias somewhere right? Definitely, but I don't know how much or what it's towards, but bias is unavoidable. I will however tackle these reviews carefully; focusing just on the album's themselves. I'll elaborate more on how I myself started listening to them in a later review.\n\nAnyways.... Kill 'Em All was Metallica unhinged, in not so many words. They were basically kids when writing and recording this. Kids who loved NWOBHM, and wanted to push music to the limit. There is no variation here. From the band name, to the album title and cover, to the fact that you can say every song title while bobbing your head, holding up the horns, and furrowing your brow and suddenly you\u2019re wearing acid washed denim, have long hair, and Reagan\u2019s still the prez. This album screams eighties, and that\u2019s a big part of its appeal. It rocks. It REALLY rocks. Every little bit is completely headbangable, and you almost can't help but do it. When Hit the Lights starts with that simple though 100% fitting intro, with all the instruments just kind of blaring and being loud, you can't know what\u2019s coming. And that bouncy, bluesy riff starts playing..... OHHHHHHhhhhhh... it just feels great! Throw a few squealed WOO's and yelps in there and this song has you pumped from the get go. It's got just a brilliant structure, where just a few (albeit amazingly memorable riffs) are arranged in a way that it feels like you\u2019re never hearing the same riff twice in a row. This is actually my personal favorite on the album. The catchy vocal lines and the never-ending stream of solos just can't be topped.\n\nTo combat the downright energy of that opener, we go right into The Four Horsemen, the most atmospheric song here. Mechanix is far inferior in nearly every aspect. It's faster, but just listen to this! It will ingrain its way into your memory, never to leave again. The lyrics are much better, unless you\u2019re in middle school, and sex puns are fresh and raunchy. Though this version is not perfect either; there's a reason the band doesn't play the Sweet Home Alabama bridge live....\n\nLet's take a step back and look at the big picture here. The cover image is striking and iconic, the band photo looks like a group who are considering beating you (seriously look at the picture, Cliff looks downright terrifying, Lars is giving the stink eye, James looks like he's part ape, and Kirk... well Kirk looks like a pretty girl. Maybe Lars is giving you a dirty look for eyeing his woman) and the album came out when Hellhammer was considered brutal. This was a big development in metal, with the speed, crunch and unbridled... well metal! This album should come in an iron jewel case, because this album, and the guys who made it were gonna be as heavy as they could, regardless of if anyone else approved. And what you here is the passion. Metallica rose to fame as the common man's metal band. They weren't going with an extreme image, or a false satanic image to gain notoriety. They were just young guys, who wanted to make metal music their way. And the metal they made had some amazing guitar work right from the beginning of their career!\n\nThe guitar work is heavy and fast, aging a little bit over the years, but still fun as hell. Great riffs. REALLY great riffs and a whole lot of 'em. I mean just pick a spot on the album, any spot, and the guitar work is like a spectral hand grabbing the back of your neck and shaking you back and forth. Classic, rocking style, not as refined as later works, by this band and others but no doubt still as potent as it weas when it first dropped. The bluesier tone is right at home here, and the bands clear youthful enthusiasm is audible in the multitude of powerful, often rapid riffing on display here. The admittedly few moments where the guitars slow down a bit, (never to a drone, but a good mid-paced gallop) are just as effective, like on Four Horsemen, Seek and Destroy, and bits thrown in across other tracks. And as I mentioned above, there\u2019s a million solos, and they all shred.\n\nBut when every solo just comes off as shred, it gets a little repetitious and wears on me after a while. The album is over fifty minutes, and every track has a lot of soloing to it, and frankly, it's hard to discern one solo from the others. No solo really has a significant drop in quality from the others, and when I pick one song off my iPod to listen to I can listen to any song on here, but it wears me down to listen to every song in a row. The exact opposite of the masterworks to follow. Overall however, the guitar work is much better then your average album, and it truly laid the stonework for future thrash bands.\n\nThe bass just follows suit here, and as a result I don't really notice. Likely the result of Cliff Burton's late joining, as he would not have time to come up with his own, third-guitar style bass lines like on the next two albums. The much contested (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth is Burton's sole credit here, and it is a bit of a double edged sword. It is a very well done, interesting solo that merits a listen. Or two. But I find myself skipping it on repeated listens. No fault on the solo itself, but it is just a bass solo, and I think it should have had parts of it incorporated into a full song as opposed to being just hung out by itself. Especially since Cliff was getting a part of every live gig to do bass solos....\n\nAn energetic percussion section ties the whole thing together. Energetic is the best word to describe it, matching the enthusiasm in the guitars every second of the album (minus the first section of Pulling Teeth of course). Another way to analyze the style Ulrich demonstrates might be 'burst drumming'. Relatively simplistic beats, but with more rapid sections, and sudden thunderous fills. Technical? No. Could Pete Sandoval do this in his sleep? Maybe. But effective? Hell yes. Simple, effective, but most importantly (like everything else here) metal as all hell. Lars probably delivers the most diverse display here. For good reason of course, they wanted the guitars to be relentless. But the symbol work sometimes thrown in little segments has an almost jazzy, light-hearted feel. Hearing that type of subtle hints in songs like Hit the Lights and Phantom Lord, and all the great bursts mentioned above, make his drumming here sound refreshing and innovative even today.\n\nThe last issue I have to deduct points for are the lyrics. What we get here is nothing like the more topical, meaningful lyrics that we are treated to on the nest few albums. But the lyrics are fun, and match the youthfulness that this album exudes. And in fact I'm glad this albums the way it is. This is the Metallica album I listen to when I wanna just have fun. But cheesy lines like \"No life 'til leather were gonna kick some ass tonight\" and the sheer number of times \"searching. seek and destroy\" (Fun live, but in the studio? tone it down.) is said are not up to snuff. That being said I still spin it a lot. But choosing this over the opuses to follow? Not on my desert island. And if you could only have one Metallica record would this really be the one you choose?\n\nFor being metal, fun, metal, fast, metal, enthusiastic, and holy shit is this metal, Metallica's thrash progenitor gets 80 out of 100 or a 4 out of 5.\nHighlights:\nHit the Lights\nPhantom Lord\nNo Remorse\nSeek and Destroy\nThe Four Horsemen\n",
        "\nThis is a little more than an EP, but when you consider the bands true live albums sizes, this is comparatively but an EP. And this one is worth getting for the Metallica fan hungry for more good live material. If you have yet to purchase any Metallica live packages however, the starting point should be the absolutely EPIC Live Shit box set, but this is a solid supplement.\n\nThough that is the weakness here, this is little more then a supplement to the Metallica discography. Of the songs played here, ALL of them, minus the first two are already on the Live Shit collection. Even the hidden Frayed Ends of Sanity jam at the end of For Whom the Bell Tolls is basically played in the Justice Medley from before, though that part is cool, since they start playing the song purely because the crowd wanted it. Though it is interesting to hear these songs with the modern line-up, and post vocal cord troubles Hetfield, the track redundancy is an issue.\n\nAlthough understandable since this was all in one glorious honest take from one show in a basement, and they weren't going to give the fans a concert without the classic tracks. And the performance is so great, with an abundance of fan interaction that I can easily forget that these are the songs I've heard before. James Hetfield is funny and charming as ever, but the whole band talks and jokes with the crowd the whole way through.\n\nThe mix is what you'd expect from a Metallica performance. They have all the resources you could want, and they use them. The recording sounds just perfect, with crisp guitars, meaty drums, and clear vocals. The bass could have been a little louder, but what you can hear sounds fine. The crowd is mixed pretty loud, but in a good way. The venue was a freaking basement, so they were right up close and personal with the band, allowing them to talk to the band as much the band talks to them, which is refreshing to hear.\n\nThe band has released a few of these shorter live EP's in the past few years, and this is one is actually very good and holds its own due to the charm and personality of the band. The set list has all good songs, albeit some redundant choices. Though No Remorse is really knocked out of the park here. If you only get one Metallica live album, it should be Live Shit. If you only get one of these EP's, Six Feet Under II has some live versions of songs you only can get on there. Though if you want a nice honest Metallica live CD, this one delivers the band in a humble setting, and it gives you every second of that concert. And to me, that makes it a worthy release.\n",
        "\nIf Master of Puppets is the media's favourite Metallica album, ...And Justice For All seems to sit in the shadows most of the time for only the most hardcore fans to proclaim the best. This is because ...And Justice... suffers from the one of the biggest issues of all: the production.\n\nMusically, it is a solid prog-thrasher where the average run time per song is 7.52 minutes over nine songs. That's pretty long. Death Magnetic is the only Metallica album close with 7:48 minutes over ten songs. Excessive length can sometimes be Metallica's biggest weakness, but ...And Justice... succeeds with carefully crafted ideas and an excellent relationship between guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich. In fact, ignoring any background, the album almost sounds like it was recorded by just Ulrich and Hetfield. With songs so long, it's hard for Hammett to really get in on the action, and besides his first solo in 'Blackened', it's difficult to remember his highlights, although solos in 'One' and 'To Live Is To Die' seem to receive praise. Newsted's bass playing is mixed so low it is practially impossible to hear (sometimes I think I can hear it, most of the time I can't). So the biggest draw here is definitely the collaboration between Hetfield and Ulrich. The best thing is that, if you like one song, you're bound to like most of if not all of the rest. On the flip-side, dislike the first song? You'll probably dislike the rest.\n\nThe production isn't a 'problem' per se, but many are put off by the very low levelled bass guitar and the clicky, dry drums. The low, barely audible bass is supposedly down to the juvenile behaviour of Ulrich and Hetfield, hazing the newcomer Jason Newsted. The drums being down to the neglected use of the ambient room microphones during the mixing process is definitely easier to believe. The result of such mixing decisions is that no matter how great the music is, it can sound dull. The lack of bass removes energy from the low end, and the lack of ambience on the drums results in a dead and unnatural sound. It would have been nice to have similar ambience of Ride... or Master..., but time has been kind because it's now very hard to imagine it any other way than how it is.\n\n'Blackened', '...And Justice For All' and 'Eye of the Beholder' are three most 'Metallica' songs the band have written, and set the standard high for the rest of the album. 'Blackened' features a weird reversed guitar intro, whilst sounding better musically when played the right way, has a strange but beneficial atmosphere to it. And Kirk's solo is lightning! The best part is when he harmonizes over the chorus... woohee that sounds great! '...And Justice For All' starts with one of my favourite introductions of all time, with convoluting rhythms and riffs, jerky guitar parts and even jerkier drumming. It is yet another example of Metallica's mastery of rhythm and maturity to know when and how much variation to use. 'Eye of the Beholder' has an almost groove-like feel and proceeds to a bridge I was hoping was going to happen: a simple development of the previous riffs. It might not sound like much but it's always nice to hear an artist say 'Hey this riff is awesome, let's see how we can change it and make it different', which is a lot better than 'Hey this riff is awesome, let's use it to death'. To these ears, the rest isn't quite 'up there' with those three tracks, but ends strongly on Ulrich's crowning moment: 'Dyers Eve'. It's definately the track to play for people who doubt the tiny drummer's skills. James also gives his all vocally, sounding very emotional when screaming 'DEAR MOTHER, DEAR FATHER! What is this hell you have put me through?!', it's enough to give you the chills and an astonishing way to end the album.\n\n...And Justice... is the last fully thrash metal album Metallica would do for 20 years, much to many people's disdain. It might take a while to fully appreciate but in the end it is totally worth it, although I do wish a tiny bit that the production was better. I feel as though I'll end up liking it a lot more the longer I spend time with it. With plenty of bright spots (especially in the first half), it still isn't quite a 'must-listen' of the genre, but a pleasantly consistent album to perk things up a bit after Master of Puppets.\n",
        "\nLet's face it, I love Metallica. To achieve what they have done is most people's dream: the money, the metal and the longevity. Just to debut so strongly would be enough for me. Kill Em All takes the speed of Motorhead, the guitar attack of Iron Maiden and the fun hot rockin'/fantasy themes of Judas Priest combined with a punk youthfulness, and spawns the diamond of the Big Four of Thrash Metal debuts, hell, it is the ultimate thrash debut.\n\nKill Em All feels like a collection of greatest hits from every influential heavy metal band that had come before. Increasing the tempo, overloading with riffs and solos, and a pleasant blend of young punk vs Lemmy vocals single-handedly preserves, updates and elaborates on the classic heavy metal formula. 'The Four Horsemen' definately stands out amongst the other tracks, sounding a lot tighter than the otherwise awesome Megadeth equivalent 'Mechanix'. To help tell the tale of, as is clear, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Metallica (reworking a song by ex-member Dave Mustaine) construct a monster: a just over seven minutes long sprawler with enough riffs to keep anyone happy, hell there's even a bizarre but effective send up of 'Sweet Home Alabama' in the bridge. It is a song that benefits from a slower tempo: each instrument is clearly defined, and the lyrics crisp and intelligible, unlike the awkward slurring of Mustaine on 'Mechanix'. The length, subject matter and progressive composition of the song leaves it feeling a little out of place amongst fun-loving tracks such as 'Hit the Lights' and 'Motorbreath', but demonstrates the full potential of the band.\n\nAnother highlight is the party-metal track 'Jump In The Fire', where the band invites you to just sit back and let the forces of rock take you away. Try to forget that chorus! I find myself remembering it each morning before washing... 'Jump In The Show-ahh!' I sing to myself... no joke. The rest of the album is equally as joyous, with Metallica reaching out to fans new and old on 'Metal Militia', and tracks like 'No Remorse' and 'Whiplash' demonstrating Metallica's respect of the power of the riff. Perhaps what makes these songs work so well is the combination of excellent verse riffs, a clear and unrushed vocal delivery and catchy but well-earned choruses. So often with early thrash releases can bands fail to spark interest during the verses, only to seem like they're trying too hard to be catchy in the choruses. Each song has memorable sections, and no wasted moments.\n\nFour extremely talented friends have been given a chance to show off their skills. James Hetfield gives his all when singing, more than making up for his voice not yet being particularly tuneful, and his right hand plays some of the most memorable and inspiring riffs the band has produced. Lars Ulrich shines, sounding best when he's playing fast and hard. Kirk Hammet is let rip soloing left and right, suiting the feel of the album perfectly. Cliff Burton's abilities are best demonstrated on the album's interlude 'Pulling Teeth' (a track ignored for the final rating - it isn't actually a song), a silly but impressive noodly bass solo, but he does have his moments on tracks such as 'The Four Horsemen' and 'Hit the Lights'. Together they form one supreme being. A being dressed in leather, sporting long hair and metal chains. But most importantly, a being with a smile on its face. It's so fun to listen to Kill Em All, and not just in a cold-hearted ironic way.\n\nThe production doesn't feel polished and it works. Compare the guitar tone to Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All. Benefiting from less dimension, Kill Em All sounds like an all American V8 muscle car, screaming down the highway. This is probably the only Metallica album where the bass is of satisfying clarity, providing a chunkiness that doesn't exist on the rest of 80s Metallica releases. Listen to 'Metal Militia' in comparison to 'Dyers Eve'... where did the bass go?!\n\nAll in all, there aren't many fair criticisms that can be thrown at it, besides maybe the inclusion of the bass solo, which is more like a cool bonus track than anything else. Some people think the album is dumb or stupid, but then you have to disregard most metal that came before it for similar reasons. Just have fun with it, Metallica sure did.\n",
        "\nI have spent many years pretending to hate Metallica, and it is only recently I have realised how awesome they actually are, and that even production problems can't prevent me from enjoying ...And Justice For All or St Anger. They have done not-as-good-as-the-rest songs in the past, but they have always been listenable and provided strong album filler. Unfortunately, Load takes it to the next level and features some indefensibly dreadful compositions. And so many too! Since when does an album need to be 14 songs long?! Let's not give it the courtesy of a long review.\n\n'The House That Jack Built' is the most repulsive Metallica track ever, neither interesting or likeable on first listen. There are no hooks to speak of, neither is there an atmosphere; Metallica sound like they were literally dead during the recording process. The whole composition sounds wrong; it sounds broken. I can feel any sense of hope dying inside when those first few arpeggio chords ring out, and feel sick when the vocals come in. It's definitely the worst Metallica song for me. I can't even listen to it. So the rest of the album kind of looks good in comparison, right? Ehh... You would have to be completely starved of decent music or have no basic music-based education to think songs like 'Bleeding Me' and 'Cure' are in any way good. Sure, they aren't bad - they follow the basic principles of songwriting, but they are so terribly average that it doesn't even feel like Metallica anymore. More a side project with the same members, where the songs aren't written by any of them.\n\nIs there anything excellent on this album? Yes, and it is the worst titled song on the album: 'Ain't My Bitch'. And what exactly makes it the best? It has energy. It's inane and bluesy, but goes quick enough to prevent too much analysis. Which is the problem with the rest of the album: yes, there's some neat blues riffs, but they're killed by slow tempos, under-development and feeling unnatural in the hands of Metallica. '2 X 4' is dumb, and what seems like a 'Man! I Feel Like A Woman' crossover: From 'I'm-a gonna make you, shake you, take you!' I'm forever going to be ready for 'I only wanna have a good time!' to come next. Those verses weirdly fit together. But that is another song with plenty of energy and heart. 'Hero of the Day' is maybe the biggest stylistic departure for the band, listed by Wikipedia as a 'power ballad'. It's quite cute, with soft verses over which Hetfield does his best cuddly but misunderstood lion impression. Sadly, it suffers from a ridiculously unsuitable bridge, which is far too heavy in relation to rest of the song, and due to the production and guitar tone, it sounds very messy. And as much as I once disliked 'Mama Said', it feels like some actual thought went in during composition, and you can feel the emotion during recording. Hetfield sings very well, and makes the song his. In fact, as mentioned above, it sounds and feels like a solo-release by Hetfield.\n\nThe rest of the album is take it or leave it. And that isn't really something you can have said about Metallica before this release. The songs do little to inspire, they don't make me want to pick up a guitar and play along, and the lyrics and melodically stunted compositions are nothing to sing or hum along to. If you cut down the goddamn length it wouldn't be so bad! Some of these songs are not material good enough for an album release, and would have made a fairly okay but avoidable EP (like Beyond Magnetic). The length isn't even the worst thing about reviewing the album... it's the general 'meh'-ness of the music. All of this is only made worse by the disappointment of realizing that 'Fuel' isn't on this album, when I always thought it was. Some people recommend this to hard rock/blues rock fans, but even that seems a bit insulting; none of these songs are essential to the genre. Load is purely for the most hardcore Metallica fan, who can find more ways to defend it than I can.\n",
        "\nWhen writing Ride the Lightning, Metallica had to make a crucial decision: go the safe route and continue motorbreathing and hitting the lights, or to become the true four horsemen of metal. Simplified: become a goofy novelty act or establish themselves as a serious band. Not to badmouth Kill Em All (it is my favourite Metallica album after all), but if the band carried on in that direction they would have gotten stale pretty quickly, and any later change of tone would have been unconvincing to the metal scene. Metallica chose the correct choice: the way of progression. This direction is helped by the inclusion of 'The Four Horsemen' and 'Phantom Lord' on Kill Em All, which proved to fans that the band could do 'serious' fantasy themes and do it very well. So why not do a whole album with a serious face? Enter, Ride...\n\nAnd the first three notes are 'Blackbird' by The Beatles? I kid, but it is cool to think that three very recognisable notes can lead to two very different songs. After a short and pretty acoustic intro 'Fight Fire With Fire' bursts forth with venom. The album strikes a nice balance between reverb and actual body, which is the bane of many thrash metal album. Too little reverb and it can seem dull and unexciting, too much and you lose the energy. But nay, Metallica's new production feels huge, adding much dimension to the sound as required by the increasing dimensions of the music. My favourite, 'Fade To Black' is the song that most benefits from this. The natural reverb of the acoustic sections give it an almost live feeling, making it easier to get caught in the emotion of Hetfield's vocal performance, and the emotion of the entire track. As for the song itself, it is the epic Metallica have never quite matched. Maybe 'The Unforgiven' comes close, but 'Fade...' sends shivers down the spine, especially at the final section leading to the solo, when the guitars lead all the instruments back in with that riff, that galloping B-G-A-F# section... They are four of the most beautiful, most perfect notes ever played on guitar.\n\nHow Hetfield's voice has improved! It still isn't as commanding or as tender as it later becomes, but 'Fade To Black' is sung convincingly and successfully portrays the feelings behind the lyrics. Lars drums his heart out once again, this time at much faster tempos, and even with considerable amounts of complexity: the confusingly awesome upbeat snare of 'Fight Fire...' and the double bass pedalling towards the end of the song. Okay, so using the double bass is child's play if you're talking Lombardo or Menza or Benante, but damn it sounds good with Metallica, and it's probably the one thing they lack most of the time. It's nice to hear it. Hammett's pentatonic solos don't quite fit with the tone of the music, although I've never had too much of a problem with them when ignoring the just-plain-wrong solo in 'Damage, Inc.'. The solo intro 'Trapped Under Ice' is very 'No Remorse', but thankfully the rest of the song goes in enough of a different direction to give it a pass. Famously, the introduction to 'For Whom The Bell Tolls' features that heavily distorted and wah-pedalled chromatic passage that Burton convinced listeners was the work of a lead guitar, rather than his bass. Overall, it is the hellish tone of the bass ('The Call of Ktulu' is a prime example), Burton's technique and his contribution to the songwriting that stands out the most.\n\nThe album does feel, to me, like it stagnates creatively towards the end. I like 'Escape', 'Creeping Death' and 'The Call of Ktulu', but I have an issue with each one that prevents me from fully enjoying them. 'Escape' is weak and too simplistic in the verses, and the guitar riff matching the vocal melody in the choruses winds up feeling flat and cheesy, like Iron Maiden. Yes 'Creeping Death' does have a memorable, head clattering intro and a jerky verse riff, but I've never felt it has had much else going for it (and I know I am in the wrong, it is constantly topping 'Best Metallica Songs' lists everywhere, and people go nuts for it live), and it is generally popular opinion that even excellent musicianship can't prevent 'The Call of Ktulu' from being too long.\n\nRide the Lightning is definately a classic of the genre. It may, to me, be a little less than astonishing towards the end, but in its entirety it is essential. Metallica at this point had not yet done wrong.\n",
        "\nThe return of Metallica to their thrash roots with Death Magnetic was a widely debated event. Some claimed that the album was fantastic, and the best thing they had done since their glory days. Others said that it was drab and lifeless and should have been aborted before it was even released. Criticisms listed were the stale production and the fact that the songs are far too long and that James Hetfield's vocals have lost all the edge they once had on classic releases such as Master Of Puppets. I do not really believe that either opinion is wholly correct, however, as Death Magnetic has good points and bad points about it.\n\nThis album is indeed a return to the band's thrash days but only halfway, and this is a major problem with it. Death Magnetic just feels like the band is meandering around trying to incorporate elements of both their older sound and their more commercial sound, by having choruses that are supposed to be catchy and sing-along friendly amidst a sea of thrashy riffs. The one song that is pure thrash from start to finish, My Apocalypse, is one of three that actually work on this album all the way through. It is fast paced and straight to the point, with a lot of aggression behind it and James' vocals are quite tolerable, and it even has a moderately catchy section with the words \"MY A-POC-A-LYPSE\" shouted by James. Many of the other songs lack this feeling of being consistently enjoyable, with tracks such as Broken Beat And Scarred in particular sticking out as being just too mixed up.\n\nIt also has a distinct lack of originality and the feeling of having been here before. The Day That Never Comes is the worst offender here, coming across as a carbon copies of songs such as One and Welcome Home (Sanitarium). It follows the same path as those two ballads from their earlier works with quite a soft opening that builds up toward an aggressive finish. This song is a great track but it feels unoriginal as any fan of the band has already heard this song twice before, just a little bit shorter on their early works and more to the point. James' vocals are an issue that needs addressing and on this song the problems with them really start to show. For the most part he attempts singing, which is clearly a bad idea as Reload and Load showed off, but it is his shouting that gets irritating. He literally sounds like a constipated bullfrog for the most part.\n\nThe instrumental work for Death Magnetic is a mixed bag. Many of the riffs are very fast and angry, such as on the opening track, but at times they dip in quality, such as on The Unforgiven III (most unnecessary sequel song ever, for gods sake, Metallica, just kill this series already). The drumming is at least aggressively played again but is completely dull and boring, and Lars can not do double-bass anymore whatsoever. His drumming is intense on tracks like the aforementioned opening song, That Was Just Your Life, but he just does not vary his drumming enough and it feels too simplistic. The one section of the instrumental performance from the band that really does shine is the soloing, which is a good thing after the solo-less St. Anger album that was released five years before. The Day That Never Comes in particular shows off how good Kirk is at soloing for those who had forgot how good he was on their earliest releases.\n\nThe production is arguably worse than that of St. Anger here. On that particular album the main problem came from the rattle effect on the drums and whilst that is missing here thankfully, everything feels too compressed. Take the guitar tones of And Justice For All and the abysmal production job of their debut and that is essentially what this sounds like. The drums are too loud in the mix and the instruments all have rough sounds to them that makes this feel more like a demo tape than an actual full length release. This is something that will irk you throughout your listen to this and will most likely make you want to snap the CD in frustration. Quite why the band can't just go back to the crisp production jobs of Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets is beyond me. Hell, I'd even take a too-glossy production such as on their self-titled over the garbage $10 production job here.\n\nDeath Magnetic is something of a shallow return to their glory days, but only glimmers of grandeur really show through. For the most part this is just an uninspired, tepid re-hash of their earliest material minus and of the ingenuity that carried those albums.\n",
        "\nThis album is plagued by several issues - awful production, the sheer length, to name a few. But I wouldn't say that those quoted by people most often - the general style, Lou Reed's rather tuneless vocals and often comical lyrics are really issues by themselves. They're central to the concept itself and actually primarily work in this case. This album being released under the moniker of Metallica is kind of an annoying distraction. This has less to do with Metallica than anything they've ever released. At most, its merely a vehicle and instrument for Lars to posit Metallica as a bunch of artistic visionaries and rationalise decades of kowtowing to the mainstream. \n\nNo, this album is really about Lou Reed. Its practically Lou indulging himself selfishly knowing that having the Metallica sticker on front would mean hapless fans of the band would buy the album anyway. Its an equally parasitic relationship - with Lars exploiting Lou's legacy for some artistic credibility and Lou exploiting Metalllica's crass commercial value for his creative efforts. If anything, this album is much too self indulgent and we can see glimpses of absolutely everything - Lou's mammoth resentment for his own lack of commercial success, his contempt for the public writ at large all over the record witnessed in his saying the album itself is meant for 'literate people'. Even the concept could be seen as chiefly appealing to Lou and practically noone besides him, his latent bisexuality getting its thrill out of describing the central character's sexual masochism in a raw and uninhibited fashion. Heck, I'd even argue that he's attracted to the concept itself for its self evocative title - 'Lulu'.\n\nBut I digress. What is chiefly redeeming and simultaneously irritating about this effort is that self indulgence. Now, the role of Metallica in this has been reduced to the backing band - all the riffs, the instrumentation are simply a droning backdrop to the lyrical gymnastics of Reed. Surprisingly, this actually brings out a rather palatable side of Metallica. Witness the droning, Sabbath-like riff in 'The View'. Or 'Mistress Dread' - a riff that has a slight black metal aesthetic (emphasis on aesthetic) in its execution. This is really more creative and lively than the band has been for ages. Nevertheless, the band still manages to get fairly irritating at times - James characterless vocals prove even more annoying than Reed's tunelessness and Lars' drumming being terrible enough to not even scrape up for drone.\n\nConsidering the lyrics are where the material aspect of the album really is, they are pure kitsch. Garbage. Its absolutely raw and uninhibited, stream of consciousness stuff. And often entirely comical, which is readily apparent even on the opener. Heck, I guess it takes some balls to throw in something quite as off-putting and comical as 'cut my arms and tits off' in the first 30 seconds of an album of 90 minutes length. But then again the whole album is really very far removed from any pragmatic point of view, and this really couldn't be judged by any conventional means. Doing so would only result in incomprehensibility. Reed's rambling and blathering may strike one as tuneless and untrained at first. But against the backdrop of this drone, and with the sheer rawness of the execution of it all - at times, it actually works brilliantly. \n\nThe only real problem is that with its assigned length, this is all too overwhelming. While Reed is taking his shot at his first real work uninhibited by any commercial concerns, akin to Metal Machine Music many years prior - he essentially shoots himself in the foot by really supplying far too much in short demand. But then again, I doubt he even remotely gives a fuck. The album is that blatantly self indulgent. If it was cut in half, much like the arms and tits of the central character, and whittled down considerably - well, it certainly wouldn't be any more palatable for conventional listening, but it would begin making a whole lot more sense. Sadly, for now, the best that can be done is reveling in the album's occasional successes at conveying a sense of atmosphere as it originally intended. And at its unending stream of hilarity with Reed eulogising about being 'spermless like a girl', 'sniffing shit like a dog', 'wagging my ass like a dark prostitute', 'the smell of your armpit' and other unintended slabs of comic gold. Its certainly a provocative listen with no remote equivalent out there. Though you'd do just as well just skipping over it entirely. Just saying.\n",
        "\nWhen it was announced that Metallica and Lou Reed would be writing and recording an album together, there was a lot of intrigue and a sense of mystery about it. Some felt that the album would be fantastic due to both artists having created some superb music over the years but others thought that the album would be a flop and there would be nothing good about it whatsoever. When the first single was released, entitled The View, most people agreed that the latter category of people had been right. The track got panned and pretty much set the standard of the rest of the album in most people's eyes.\n\nThe View comprises of three riffs in total, with two faster sections and a more droning verse riff that just chugs along. The guitar work is a lot weaker than one would expect from the two guitarists that created such classics as Ride The Lightning but the solo is a little better than should be expected. The main riff during the verse is quite boring and is made up of a few chords whilst Lou Reed rambles on over the top of it all. The vocals are somewhat monotonous, with no variation in tone whatsoever but it is the lyrics that are interesting. Lou Reed is a lyrical poet and showcases this on here with many rather odd-sounding lines such as \"I want to see your suicide, I want to see you give it up\". On this particular song the lyrical content is fairly strong for the most part and is one of the best things about the track but there is one line in particularly that drags it down. \"I am the table\". Whatever was going through Lou's mind when he wrote this is quite disturbing. James delivers this particular line and it could not sound more ridiculous in the context of the song. James' cameo appearance as a vocalist is very underwhelming and detracts quite a bit from the song but the lyrics and the solo are enough to carry it through. The faster riff that carries this section is quite interesting and a lot better than the one during the verse and adds quite a bit to the quality of The View.\n\nThe View is a track that gets somewhat underrated due to the droning nature of the slow verse riff. It has some interesting lyrics that are thought provoking and also a nice riff during the faster sections of the songs, with a cool solo as well.\n",
        "\nAh, Kill 'Em All. If you like deep, thought-provoking, awe-inspiring metal, then let me direct you to Black Sabbath's Master of Reality. But if you want a to kick back with a cold beverage and enjoy a ridiculously fun romp, then Kill 'Em All was made for you. Kill 'Em All is the first album by Metallica. In case you've been living under a rock your whole life, let a surface-dweller educate you. Metallica is part of the Big Four of thrash metal, the other three being Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer. Metallica's first four albums (five depending on who you ask) are considered to be heavy metal must-haves. While Kill 'Em All is the weakest of Metallica's first four efforts without question, it's a great album that will warrant many listens for Metallica fans like myself. \n\nProduction is pretty fuzzy, but this album was recorded on a budget of approximately $12 that Lars probably stole from his mom's purse so I couldn't expect it to be a masterpiece. The only thing I really listen for as far as production on an album is simple contrast. I want to hear every instrument, and I want them to mesh together. Kill 'Em All has delivers in spades. Every instrument, every cooperating sound, flows perfectly together and no one aspect outshines the rest of the band, and the fact that you can actually hear Cliff Burton's bass is definitely a plus. \n\nKill 'Em All may not be the deepest Metallica album, but the instrumentation is very solid. Kirk plays some of his best and most memorable solos here, Hetfield's riffs are mind-blowingly fast, Lars's drumming is at its best (ie he actually sounds like he knows how to use a fill) and of course Cliff Burton was and is one of metal's greatest bassists. His solo (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth is one of Kill 'Em All's highlights and really draws you in in a haunting way. James's voice isn't particularly special here, he doesn't have a lot of subtlety in his delivery, but this album doesn't have many subtle moments so that's a bit understandable. He can still hit the highs and shriek like the best hardcore punk frontmen, and it fits the breakneck speed of Kill 'Em All exceptionally well. \n\nSo, what deep, harrowing topics does the songwriting on Kill 'Em All cover? life in the fast lane, and...more life in the fast lane, mostly. Just about every song is about how great it is to live fast, or how great it is to be Metallica, or just how great thrash metal is. And in the end, isn't that the noblest of causes? \n\nI'll just put it out there: This is a very consistent album. The only track that's really different from the rest is Pulling Teeth. However, if an album has a formula, and the formula is good, that just leaves room for more standouts. It's nigh-impossible for me to pick a favorite track. I love the Four Horsemen with its apocalyptic musings, the midtempo chug of Seek and Destroy, but my favorite track, if I absolutely had to pick one, is probably Whiplash. This is the greatest example of why Kill 'Em All is so much fun to listen to-it's Metallica singing about thrash metal, how much they love thrash metal, and how much fun it is listening to thrash metal. I just like the idea of that. \n\nSo as we've admitted already, nothing here is going to challenge you in anything other than Guitar Hero. But that's a real breath of fresh air, in a way, isn't it? Isn't it great to hear an album that knows where it's at? It's not trying to change your life, or rock your worldview. Hell, The Four Horsemen is the deepest track by far, and even it doesn't take itself overly seriously. No, Kill 'Em All is just having a good time, and it wants you to have a good time with it. I don't think that's too much to ask. This is a band that usually takes itself very seriously, recording an album that doesn't take itself too seriously. I'd love to see more of that from other thrash bands. This isn't nearly as heavy as Master of Puppets, And Justice For All, or especially Ride the Lightning, it's just great, speedy, punk-influenced metal. This album, along with Judas Priest's Painkiller, is simply the epitome of a good time, plain and simple. If you like pure raw, all-killer-no-filler thrash metal, this is for you.\n",
        "\nNo album in history has ever divided metal fans as much as Metallica's Black Album. Most purists will agree that all their later album are crap (with a few Death Magnetic fans here and there) and that all their previous albums are great, but the Black Album seems to be the cause of endless debate. And while it is pretty flawed, and does have a bit too much mainstream appeal for its own good, Black is good for the occasional listen, if you keep an open mind. \n\nI actually think the production is very well-done. It obviously is a bit more pop-oriented, but it suits the material being recorded here. The bass has been sidelined once again (something that has happened on seemingly every 'Tallica release since Cliff died) and while that is disappointing, most of the other aspects are great. Lars's drums have an immensely satisfying \"crash\" feel that make the Black Album great for air-drumming. The guitar tones are cleaned up a bit on some tracks, but it still sounds pretty consistently good and doesn't stray too dramatically from the metal tones of previous Metallica classics. \n\nInstrumentation isn't nearly as impressive as previous efforts. James plays some memorable (if not very complex) riffs, Lars still hasn't quite found the balance between \"not enough fills\" and \"too many unnecessary fills\", and Kirk's solos would be great if not for him violation the wah-pedal. I curse the day he discovered that godforsaken thing. James's voice sounds a little worn, but he can still roar on some of the Black Album's stronger tracks. One problem I have with his vocals here is his lack of subtlety. He sounds somewhat out of his element on softer offerings like the Unforgiven and Nothing Else Matters. What happened to the haunting James from Fade to Black or One? \n\nSongwriting is another aspect of the Black Album that early Metallica diehards will roast on an open fire, and unfortunately, they're not entirely wrong. The writing here is a lot weaker than the acid-tongued political fire of their previous offering, ...And Justice For All. Most of the songs are over-the-top attempts at being dark and mysterious (Enter Sandman), misguided, oh-so-poignant \"quiet\" tracks (Nothing Else Matters) or just petty put-downs (Holier Than Thou), with a special mention going to the hilariously overwrought \"patriotic\" lyrics of Don't Tread On Me. Now, most of these songs DO rock, and are fun to listen to, but writing is probably the weakest link on the Black Album. \n\nSo, now let's look at the tracks that stand out (for better or for worse). My favorite track on this album is a bit of a tough call, and it comes down to My Friend of Misery and The God That Failed. The former is a pretty standard example of the petty put-downs I mentioned before, but it is definitely the best-written of the put-down songs on the Black Album, and has some great, dark moments. However, if I had to choose, this one goes to the God That Failed, just for how amazingly well-written it is. James sings about the loss of his mother, and how he feels scorned by God. The track has that balance and subtlety that the album's other \"emotional\" tracks sorely lack. Some other honorable mentions go out to Through the Never, Of Wolf And Man, Holier Than Thou, and Don't Tread On Me. I know, I poked fun at those last two, but they're still great fun at their core. The weakest track is definitely The Unforgiven, which feels like the harbinger for the Black Album's god-awful followup Load. \n\nSo overall, I'd say the Black Album is ultimately a winner. Yes, it is a sellout album for sure, but at least it was a good sellout album. Is it one for the hist'ry books? No. However, I do leave you with this piece of advice: The Black Album has some great singles, but the true strength of this LP is in its deep cuts. If you can get past the commercial desperation this album is permeated with, I recommend a listen.\n",
        "\nTo be fair, Metallica was already disappointing some fans, what with a slow song on Ride the Lightning (get the hell over it), and those of you who pretend you actually heard the Metallica demos with Dave Mustaine and were blown away, then were pissed when Kill \u2018em All was released because of the replacement of Dave by Kirk Hammet. Yeah, I\u2019m sure there\u2018s a possibility that this happened, but to what, like five people maximum? Let\u2019s face it, most of the people who say Metallica was better with Mustaine are just Megadeth fans. Because God knows, if two bands don\u2019t like each other, sides must be taken. Good thing there\u2019s no God.\n\nAnyway, as with just about any given point in Metalllica\u2019s career, this album led a many people to board the Metallica train and a handful switch to the Hate Train at the station. Well, first of all, I tend to dismiss those who say they hated Metallica after Mustaine left (implying they loved the demos and hated Kill \u2018em All) as asshats, and secondly, the people who liked Kill \u2018em All but not Ride the Lightning aren\u2019t quite so numerous as those who fell off the Metallica bandwagon at any other point. So around the release of Master of Puppets seems to be where the whole \u201cMetallica Sucks Now\u201d thing starts for a lot of people. \n\nThis is the album where Metallica really began to become the band we know them as today. James\u2019 voice deepens, we get more of that growly voice, and his screeches are going away. Lars\u2019 drumming, while never incredible, starts to get a little lazier. There\u2019s more wah on Kirk\u2019s guitar and Cliff\u2026is Cliff. A great bassist, maybe a little overrated. I had a friend who once said he was a good bassist who clearly wished he was a guitarist because he plays like a guitarist, and there\u2019s truth to that.\n\nThe first criticism a fan of the band's past work may notice is that this album lacks the band really just letting the thrash loose. Battery and Damage Inc. are great thrashers, but they have incredibly pointless, and in the case of Damage Inc., overlong intros. I don\u2019t know why Metallica decided to recycle the \u201cacoustic intro, then thrash\u201d idea that opened Ride the Lightning, but while I always felt that a sort of unassuming atmosphere which to then shock the listener with a thrash onslaught the first time, this is just sort of like telling a joke, then telling the same joke again with a slight alteration. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse than 100 dead babies in a dumpster? One dead baby in 100 dumpsters. What\u2019s worse than 100 dead babies nailed to a tree? 1 dead baby nailed to 100 trees.\u201d There. That\u2019s how inane this idea was. Additionally, the title track is also ALMOST a good thrash song, but then it hits that slow middle section. Why? To sound progressive? To add emotion? I don\u2019t know. I like this song, but I never got that part. It didn\u2019t really fit the attitude at that moment. The \u201cwhere\u2019s the dreams that I\u2019ve been after\u201d-part is cool, and then it picks back up and finishes well enough, but the quiet solo...I don\u2019t know, I never got it. It felt like a padding or filler moment and sort of kills the flow of the song for me. Disposable Heroes may be the only true thrash song on the album, and it\u2019s a pretty damn good one, however probably not as good as the opener and closer would be if they dropped their intros. \n\nMost of the album doesn\u2019t really even try to thrash. Leper Messiah is more of a mid-paced song and it\u2019s one of the ones that usually come up when people talk about least favorite tracks on the album, but it\u2019s ok, they\u2019re allowed to be wrong, and it\u2019s a good song. As the song nears a little past the midway point it becomes something of a thrash assault. The Thing That Should Not Be...well, maybe it shouldn\u2019t have been. This is a more doomy song and I believe the band at some point did say it was sort of a tribute to Black Sabbath, and I\u2019m sure that Sabbath was highly displeased, except Ozzy, who was too fucked up to know who he was. Not that this song is offensively bad, it\u2019s just sort of boring sometimes. But if Sabbath knew anything, it was how to keep a song interesting. I will say that the solo to the song is a very cool solo, though. \n\nThe song is based on the Cthulhu mythos, much like Call Of Ktulu on the last album, and the solo as well as some of the background guitar noise has a very interesting vibe to it that almost comes off as a soundtrack to slipping into insanity . Some of it reminds me of the noises made in the film Evil Dead when we see the first person camera demons stalking the woods, and the solo almost sounds like maniacal laughter or something in some places. However, the biggest problem is that maybe the whole song does work as a soundtrack to insanity in a negative way as well. Maybe insanity is playing the same riff over and over again and expecting to keep my attention. So I guess this is more of a \u2018sometimes-song\u2019 than an outright bad song, but I certainly have to be in the mood for it, and even so I usually go for the orchestrated S&M version.\n\nKeeping in something of a formula that would apply to the previous and next album, the fourth track is Welcome Home (Sanitarium), which is that it\u2019s one of the Metallica ballads, which may be its biggest problem. Its formula is very similar to One and Fade to Black and let\u2019s face it, when you compare it to those other songs, it doesn\u2019t hold up as well as either of them. It\u2019s the weak link of the three. This is not necessarily a bad song, however, and at one point was one of my favorites from the album. Let\u2019s pretend for a second that someone has never heard those songs though and say it starts off slow and melodic and becomes a thrasher near the end. \n\nThe main problem for me on the album is Orion. I don\u2019t get it. So many people love this song and I really don\u2019t get it. Why? Because Cliff\u2019s bass is audible and it was one of his last compositions? The part that starts it off, the rocking part, is pretty mediocre. Honestly, I liked it better once it slowed down and got a little progressive, but hell, there are moments of that part that bring Load/Reload to mind for me, so if those are so hated, why is this so praised. Hell, it has moments that make me go \u201cPink Floyd?\u201d Then it has a sort of quicker part, not really thrash, but just comparatively fast, before sort of farting out unimpressively. There is literally nothing in this song that makes me understand why so many people I know like it.\n\nThis albums reputation precedes it and it really has made and impact on the landscape of metal. It was one of my first metal albums (third?) and I still enjoy it, but it just doesn\u2019t live up to the \u2018bible of heavy metal\u2019 that some people think it is. It\u2019s not even the bible of Metallica. It\u2019s a decent album that for some reason everyone latched onto. I don\u2019t need to recommend this to anyone. If you\u2019re interested in metal, you should have heard it, if not memorized it, but it stands mostly on ceremony. It\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s not the greatest ever. It\u2019s kind of overrated as fuck.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s still a decent album, and while it may have popularized some of the more annoying ideas of progressive metal, it didn\u2019t kill Metallica. This is three otherwise good songs with pointless sections, two great songs, two mediocre songs, and one failure. That\u2019s not mindblowing, but it\u2019s really not the worst track record. \n\nAnd also, Reign in Blood came out the same year and you\u2019re all wrong, this is better than that album.\n",
        "\nMany years ago in the first review I ever posted on this site, I declared that the Waking the Cadaver's masterpiece of suck known as Perverse Recollections of a Necromangler to be the worst album ever made. While that album is still incredible in its terribleness, as of November 2011 it was no longer the worst record ever to disgrace the known world. It was in the first week of that month that I heard Lulu, the then-new collaborative album between Metallica, who I will openly and shamelessly admit are one of my favorite bands ever, and Lou Reed, who I had never heard of before first hearing the news of the collaboration between the two, but was somehow an incredibly influential figure in the music world. I honestly don't know how that is, as every single piece of music I've listened to from Reed has completely sucked, be it in Velvet Underground or his own solo material, but especially in this tandem effort with the most successful metal band of all time. Metallica, on the other hand, I enjoy the majority of their work, even records that have been condemned to eternal derision such as Load and St. Anger. I can't give this a pass though, because I have yet to hear a record as aurally displeasing and infuriating as Lulu. in every conceivable way this album falls flat on its face, and regardless of what the band and Reed were trying to do, it is a colossal, spectacular failure.\n\nTaking the double album approach, the album is split into two discs of varying lengths and song amounts. When it comes to disc one, the songs are of a somewhat more digestible nature on the surface due to generally being of shorter lengths, save the disc closer \"Cheat on Me\" at 11-and-a-half minutes. However, upon hearing the first song \"Brandenburg Gate\", the massive, inescapable flaw of the record reveals itself in the first two minutes: almost nothing, NOTHING, of any interesting note happens in any of these songs. Guitars are strummed, bass is picked, drums are hit, and words are \"sung\" (or in Lou Reed's case, rambled off key and endlessly with no real objective or point to be found), but none of it is in any way pleasing to listen to. At times there will be an interesting riff, such as the thrashy start of \"Mistress Dread\", but the group squanders it by just doing it over and over and over and over and over with no feasible end in sight aside from just turning off the song. It's like the music version of when Family Guy just drags a gag along for 5 minutes without stopping, only more maddening. The point of no return is when Lou Reed first opens his mouth, spouting about cutting off tits when thinking of Boris Karloff on the dark of the moon and AAAAAHHHH. It's the least pleasing noise to ever grace my ears this side of an Alex Jones radio broadcast, and he never shuts up. Let me repeat that for you. He. Never. Shuts. Up. You know the archetype of the crazy rambling homeless guy who just goes on and on and on about things nobody would ever in a thousand lifetimes care about ad nauseum? That's Lou Reed on this album. Combine his nonsensical, possibly drunken spoken word with incomprehensible lyrics about dog prostitutes and being dry and spermless like a girl (Huh?) and cheating on yourself (once again, HUH?) and oh my god, just shut the FUCK up, Lou Reed! The Metallica side of things is no less ridiculous in its badness, with the band lazily playing along not sounding as if they give a single solitary crap in the world about what they are doing. James Hetfield, outside of providing the world great comedic fodder with lines like the infamous \"I am the table!\", does pretty much nothing of note here. His warbling of \"Small town girrrrl-ah!\" throughout \"Brandenburg Gate\" is both really funny and really out of place, as it just feels like it was thrown in without any care for placement within the structure of the song. If there is any one minor, slightly significant positive I can muster up the will to give the first disc, it's that it's at least memorable in its terribleness, like a musical equivalent to a Tommy Wiseau movie. If the record had stopped with the end of this disc, it could possibly be considered a \"so terrible it's amazing\" record...\n\n...but that sadly is not the case, as there's still the matter of the second disc to attend to. This is where the record, already deep in the depths of a sea of suck, drowns and, weighed down by the bloated nature of its songs, sinks to the bottom of the ocean, never to be recovered by rescue teams. The lengths of the songs jump from mostly under 7 minutes to all over 8 minutes, and all 47 painful minutes of this disc are minutes you wish that you could recover. Unlike disc one, which had a smattering of decent moments throughout, there is only one good riff on this entire disc, that being the somewhat southern doom riff found throughout opener \"Frustration\". That might just be the most fitting song name in recorded musical history, as not only does the song just continue to happen throughout its 8 and-a-half minute run time, but outside of that doomy riff, a brief moment of incredibly sloppy drum soloing from Lars Ulrich (all while Reed continues to just warble with no sense for time signature or structure), and the one minute intro of broken circus organ and guitar warbling, absolutely nothing worth noting happens. That's more than I can say for the next three songs, two of which take on a significantly more subdued style compared to all the previous songs on both this disc and the first disc. \"Little Dog\" is 8 minutes of acoustic nothingness, with guitar feedback of various tones blaring over top the music, bare bones drumming, and just a general feeling of \"This is never going to end. This is going to play forever.\" Disc and album closer \"Junior Dad\" may just be the fabled \"cure for insomnia\" that people like to label many boring songs with. This song surpasses boring, it surpasses monotony, it surpasses banality. It burrows a nice, big hole straight through your skull and into your brain, where it just attacks you with its TWENTY MINUTES of emptiness before ending in the longest 8 minutes of strings and horns ever recorded. Bands such as Dream Theater and Opeth proved long ago that songs as long as those found on Lulu's second disc can remain interesting and enjoyable. Metallica and Lou Reed are not either of those bands, and although Metallica have created numerous songs reaching 8-10 minute mark that are just a blast to listen to, that same ingenuity cannot be found on this disc. It is an unending, unpleasant, insufferable bore of a disc that doesn't even meet disc one's memorability in terms of terrible music.\n\nThis is a combination that should never even have been considered by either party. Neither of their styles mix in any conceivably good way, nor did anyone even speak of both Lou Reed and Metallica in the same sentence. This nearly 90 minute snoozer of a record is not only the worst album Metallica have ever slapped their name on, but it's the worst album I personally have ever listened to. As mentioned many hundreds of words ago, I am an openly massive fan of the band, and I say that without any shame whatsoever despite the years of revisionist history that has affected even their first records (No, Dave Mustaine was not responsible for Metallica's success, nor was he the only contributor of good material on Kill 'Em All), but I absolutely cannot support a record as blatantly terrible as this one. Where the majority of the blame is to be placed is beyond me, as I feel both parties had an equal hand in this atrocious record, but one thing that is for sure is that neither group will ever live this down. Just when you thought St. Anger was the lowest point in Metallica's career, along came Lulu to dethrone it. Way to go, guys. Way to go indeed.\n",
        "\nLoad is an album that has received more than its fair share of hate over the course of the years since it was released, much of which it does not deserve. What Load is is the next step in Metallica's musical evolution, having already taken place on their self titled album. Load is a fourteen track long blues-rock album with some sizable chunks of metal distributed throughout the record that clocks in at just under the CD-limit of 80 minutes, bursting with lively energy and variation unlike anything found on a Metallica release before. This album is sandwiched in between the flawed great that was The Black album and the cancer to the ear of Reload, and manages to carve out an identity all of its own. Buckle up, Sputnik, for when listening to this album, you are in for one hell of a ride.\n\nOpening the album up, Ain't My Bitch is one of the heavier songs on the album, packing the bite that Metallica were known for in their thrash hay day of the 1980's, despite continuing the deviation from this style that was introduced on the previous album. This could easily have fit in among the songs found on the Black Album, being brash and rude, whilst still being aggressive. The lyrics are rather poor, but they are more than made up for by the level of fun that has clearly been put into the song, which is blatant throughout the record. This is an album with Metallica going with the flow and incorporating so many different styles that it simply becomes a wonder that it works as well as it does. The album is primarily a blues-rock release, but there is the metal side covered by Ain't My Bitch and parts of epic closer Outlaw Torn. Until It Sleeps displays the most commercially-oriented style of Metallica that would be explored to a greater degree on the following album, with its verse-chorus structure and catchy nature, with music that takes a minimalist approach to allow for the vocals to seep to the front.\n\nWhilst on the subject of the vocals, this is James Hetfield's real transition point. The Black Album contained moments of straightforward singing on songs such as Nothing Else Matters, whilst still retaining some shouted vocals and hard-edged vocal songs on various tracks, with Enter Sandman being the most well known example of this styling. On Load, however, James never reverts to the barking that was utilized throughout the past three albums, instead packing a sleazy style of singing, akin to a more radio-friendly style of vocal work. Songs like Until It Sleeps and Cure contain some decent enough singing within the context of the album, but it is the Southern rock tinted exploration of 2 X 4 and the bellowed vocals throughout The Outlaw Torn and parts of Bleeding Me that really steal the show vocally. The Outlaw Torn carries a lot of weight through its vocals and lyrics, proving to be one of the most emotionally-charged songs the band has put out in the vein of Nothing Else Matters and The Unforgiven, but without needing to be structured as a ballad. Bleeding Me is the other epic-lengthed song of the album, with both clocking in at over eight minutes in length, and both actually utilizing said lengths to the best of their ability. Both stand out as two of the best in the band's discography, regardless of opinions on the album.\n\nThe Cure is a solid enough song, with some nice bass work perfectly audible played by Jason Newsted in the final third of the song, and containing some of the better drumming from Lars Ulrich. Ulrich went for a very simple style of playing on this album to fit in with the radio-oriented blues rock styling of the album, and, whilst it is nothing special, it actually isn't half as bad as has gone down in history. Ulrich, regardless of what mockery of himself he may have become on St. Anger, and regardless of the sellouts he had a hand in over the year, and regardless of the Napster controversy, is actually not as poor as stated. How much creativity could truly have been expected from a simplified blues rock album? The guitar work is similarly simplistic, with Kirk seamlessly adopting a shift to a more streamlined sound, whilst still retaining his knack for writing decent enough solos, evidenced here by the killer lead work found on Bleeding Me, Poor Twisted Me and Cure. The lyrics are very introspective of James Hetfield's life, dealing with various topics, including but not limited to his mothers battle with cancer and feelings of regret, as well as drug abuse. They are well written, without being anything too special, but they undeniably manage to convey the feelings that the songs outline in a formidable manner. The one major criticism that can be made of Load is the running time, with Outlaw Torn having had to be cut by over a minute in order to keep the album within the time restrictions to avoid the CD-rom skipping. However, this is not the overly drawn out styling of songs that would cripple St. Anger or Death Magnetic, instead being very much manageable song lengths, but with some feeling a little unnecessary. Bar the very personal lyrics, King Nothing is a little unnecessary, as is Mama Said which feels like a weaker version of Nothing Else Matters and contains the worst vocal performance on the album, and the repetition found towards the end of Thorn Within does drag on a little too long.\n\nOverall, this may well be one of the most criminally underrated and overlooked albums in history, standing out as one of the more unique and enjoyable in Metallica's discography, never growing stale, despite the hideously long running time and the certain lack of instrumental prowess on display on this album. This is an enjoyable enough blues rock album, which has a lot to love about it, and is merely a little too drawn out for its own good. Were it two tracks shorter, and with a couple of sections to certain songs being cut back a little, then this would stand tall among the earlier releases by the band. However, this really is still a great album and deserves a listen, being the last album that is thoroughly enjoyable to listen to. Unfortunately, the rejects from this album would later be released on the aforementioned tragedy that is Reload, which does little to redeem this album's notoriety, which was never earned in the first place.\n",
        "\nFew albums in the world of music get as frequently criticized and as much maligned as Metallica's St. Anger. Released in 2003 to mild critical acclaim, the tables swiftly turned and those that had previous been praising the album for its return to the angry style that Metallica had mastered throughout the 1980's were now claiming it to be a tragic attempt to go back to their roots minus any of the creativity. It was seen as Metallica jumping on yet another bandwagon, this time tapping into the nu-metal craze of the early 2000's. Combining simplistic down-tuned guitar riffs with no soloing whatsoever, then added to the drum sound that resembles all the cutlery in Lars Ulrich's kitchen being rattled around and some of the most pathetic attempts at lyricism to be spewed from James Hetfield's mouth, it could be said that this album was destined for disaster.\n\nThe first song on the album is entitled Frantic, and displays all that is wrong with this album, but also one of the positives that can be found. The riffing is simple chugging, with heavy use of playing open strings, and the drum sound will stick out straight away. Another album attempted this sound beforehand, the album in question being Death's The Sound Of Perseverance, except that on that album the rattling sound achieved by Lars turning off the snares on his snare drum is far more irritating and clear on here, having been done with considerable more taste on The Sound Of Perseverance. Also noticeable is the absurd and very childish lyrics written by James Hetfield, containing lines such as \"My lifestyle determines my deathstyle\" and \"Fran-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tock\". However, the aforementioned positive is found in that the band is clearly playing with genuine energy again. Far from the abomination that was Lars' drumming on the previous three releases, with over simplified patterns, he here thunders away at his drum kit, no matter what impact it has on the listener. The guitar work is incessant, and James utterly bellows his lyrics with a passion unheard from the band since ...And Justice For All. The music is by no means brilliant, but the rage that accompanies the chorus to this song and the intensity generated from the angered men playing it is more than enough to be considered a positive.\n\nThe genuine anger behind this album stems from the back story of it. The band was in turmoil following the release of Reload, having lost both their singer and bassist in the space of five months. To begin with, Jason Newsted left the band for supposed physical damage he had sustained over the years of playing metal music. The real crippling blow came in July 2001, when James Hetfield entered rehabilitation for being an alcoholic. The sound that one hears upon inserting this album into their disk player is the sound of a band playing with real hate for what they had done to themselves over the years. The lyrics, ridiculous though they may be, are James venting his fury at what he had become and using them to overcome his past life. Lars is crashing away at his drums with a passion almost unmatched in the entire music scene. This Metallica was a very different band to the one that had pressed out thrash masterpieces consistently in the 1980's. Musically inferior though they may be, the emotional performance here is still enough to make for a decent enough album to listen to.\n\nThe songs that are the best on here are Frantic, My World and The Unnamed Feeling. The former two are two raw, pissed off, unadulterated numbers that definitely merit a listen, despite the appalling sound quality and clear lack of creativity. Frantic is the most straight up aggressive number on here, whereas My World is a much more refined form of anger, until the second half, with the refrain \"not only do I not know the answer, I don't even know what the question is\" spewed from the mouth of Hetfield with a tortured shout that reminds us of the broken man he has become. This is outlined more so in the latter song, The Unnamed Feeling, in which James takes us through the story leading up to this album in a personal manner, providing one of the best vocal performances he has ever unleashed, with a decent enough instrumental to accompany this. These songs prove that Metallica are still a competent enough band and should be taken more than seriously, rather than the joke the media would have the listener believe.\n\nHowever, it is songs such as the title track and Some Kind Of Monster that prove the mishaps that occurred with this album, and drag this album down quite a bit. Both were enjoyable enough listens in their radio edit forms, but on here both exceed seven minutes and twenty seconds, dragging on far too long and using the same repetitive instrumental that has been heard thirty times already on the song. This is the worst aspect of the album, where many of the songs just reuse the same idea that has already been heard to the point it is stale. The shorter cuts on this album are, for the most part, the better songs, and even they clock in at over five minutes without ever really needing to. This was grating enough on ...And Justice For All, despite the fact that that album had enough musical ideas and creativity to save it. However, there is no excuse on St. Anger for having a running time of seventy five minutes, with around fifty minutes of this being rendered completely unnecessary due to the over-usage of the same ideas.\n\nThis album certainly deserves the hate that is thrust upon it, for there is enough to despise about the album, from the repetition of the same three-note riffs to the lack of solos and the excruciatingly long running time. None of this is helped by the fact that the lyrics are as immature as can be and the ear piercing drum tone. However, there are a few redeeming features, with three or four of the songs being entirely listenable, and some of the others being tolerable for a while. The fury on display here is a force to be reckoned with, and any supposed Metallica fan should give this a listen simply for the significance it has to the band themselves.\n\nOriginally written for Sputnik.\n",
        "\nThe year was 1983, and the stage was set for a phenomenon. An up and coming band had just fired their guitarist Dave Mustaine and called upon the services of former Exodus man Kirk Hammett for the recording of their ten song debut. The band was Metallica, taking their influences from the brash style of Venom and Judas Priest, they were to push the boundaries of what was acceptable in heavy music of its day to the absolute limit, creating a raw, powerful debut album that is generally considered to be the absolute birth of thrash metal.\n\nKill Em All was a fast album, more aggressive than anything that had been released to date, garnering the band a fair amount of attention in the Bay Area scene, building them a nice following. The album was something entirely fresh for its day, with songs such as Hit The Lights showing exactly how fast and heavy music could be played, without ever sacrificing its musical integrity. Hit The Lights was the original thrash metal song, a blueprint for everything else that was to follow, opening with the sound of the band jamming, before diving headfirst into a fast series of riffs that demolish everything in their path. Whilst not quite as mature musically nor lyrically as the albums that would follow, this was more than an adequate song, standing the test of time as one of the bands best songs, with the immortal sound of James Hetfield's tortured shriek of \"hit the lights\".\n\nHit The Lights is not the only great song found on Kill Em All, with reworked song The Four Horsemen (originally entitled The Mechanix during the time Dave Mustaine was part of the band) standing tall, along with Metal Militia and pure speed-metal brilliance Whiplash. Phantom Lord, however, proves to be the meatiest track on the album, being another Mustaine-written song, but a great track with some powerful riffs, particularly the first riff in the song. The guitar lines across the majority of this album are really well written and played, despite the speed they are played at and the age of those responsible for them. Whiplash has an incredibly fast riff that thunders along at a marvelous pace, whilst Motorbreath has some riffs that hint at a punk influence going into the writing.\n\nThe vocals on this release are completely chaotic, with Hetfield using a rather juvenile screech throughout much of the release, which isn't the best of vocal deliveries, but suits the unrefined nature of this album really well. The best vocal song on this album is found on Seek And Destroy, the most well known song from the album, being one of the only songs in which Hetfield sings in a normal tone for the majority of it, only occasionally letting out the shriek found on the rest of the album. The bass is audible throughout the album, which is rare for a Metallica album, and sounds decent enough. The extended bass solo, Anasthesia Pulling Teeth is a well written piece that showcases Cliff Burton at his finest.\n\nHowever, there is also a very ugly side to this album, with the production being right at the forefront of it. This was recorded on a tiny budget of $1,500 and it definitely shows, with a huge amount of reverb on the vocals being more than audible, and the album having a very unprofessional sound to it, particularly on the recording quality of the guitars. This is a really poor production job, and whilst not being as bad as some early thrash acts, it certainly hinders the album. The other weakness of this album is the lack of memorability found on this record. Many of the songs are not catchy enough, and feel too long, without enough high quality riffs to carry them across their lengths. When the album works, it is fine, but the weaknesses on this album are unavoidable.\n\nThis is a solid enough release, but is marred by the production found on here and the crippling lack of many moments that stick in the listeners head. Purchase this for historical value and the The Four Horsemen, Whiplash, Phantom Lord and Hit The Lights definitely, but do not expect the finest album of all time.\n\nOriginally written for Sputnik\n",
        "\nWhile most of the stuff I review tends to be popular to some extent, I've still never tackled the metal band. I mean, I've touched on Iron Maiden twice, but one of those was written when I was fifteen and it's really atrocious, and the other one I crapped out in half an hour and haven't read since I submit it initially five years ago. But Iron Maiden is really only the co-biggest metal band ever, and we all know who the big dogs in this game are. The most realistic estimate I've seen of Maiden's worldwide sales are something around 80 million albums, which is a monstrously huge number, especially for a heavy metal band. And with that in mind, Metallica has roughly 100 million with a shorter career and less albums. In terms of fans, influence, and continued relevance, I'd give the edge to Maiden as the biggest metal band of all time, but the numbers are certainly on Metallica's side.\n\nAnd because they're the biggest, they're also the most visible and most controversial. Everybody has an opinion on the great dramas of Metallica's career, like how Dave Mustaine is the only good thing that ever happened to them (saying their early era was only good because of his influence is like saying The Courtyard of the Old Residency, Munich is only good because Hitler painted it), or how the commercialization would have never happened if Cliff Burton hadn't tragically died in that bus crash (he was a huge REM fan and wrote many of the melodic parts on Master of Puppets, he would have had no problem with, and in fact probably would have encouraged, a new direction), or how Lars is a wretched fame whore and money snatching gremlin who is a smooth talker but a crappy drummer (well... that one's true). The point is that no metal fan's development went by unblemished by the unmistakable scent of Metallica. They're just ubiquitous and profoundly influential on the development of heavy metal as a whole, and unless you entered the scene via Brenoritvrezorkre and Enbilulugugal, you've heard the first four or five albums at least once. \n\nAnd with that, I need to do something strange and direct you to an Achewood strip. The scene is set when Teodor walks in on Ray playing with a toy truck:\n\nT\u00e9odor: What's with the little toy dumptruck, Ray? You have a kid over?\nRay: This's mine dude! Don't be buggin'!\nT\u00e9odor: From when you were a kid?\nRay: Kid kid kid! What's with all this kid imagery? Did you just see a kid? I play with this truck!\nT\u00e9odor: Is this some kind of new hip-hop thing, like sucking on a pacifier was a few years ago?\nRay: Look dude, if you can't have fun playin' with a toy truck, then it's time to reevaluate your life. You've become jaded. \n\nYou now have my official opinion on early Metallica. This is how it is for me, and I know I'm not in the minority here. If you can't go back to the days of your youth, put yourself back in that frame of mind, and appreciate the entry-level metal acts the same way you used to, you've become jaded. I get it, your taste evolves, you grow away from what you once loved, but if you can't even spin Kill 'em All and wreck your neck to \"The Four Horsemen\" or \"Metal Militia\" on an even nostalgic level, then you need to reevaluate your life. What you've got here is some of the most aggressive and innovative metal of the first third of the 80s, and even disregarding the historical significance of this album, it still holds up today as a showcase of melodic fury, the fast paced rage of youth, and the purest form of early thrash, when it was still just a mix of heavy metal and punk. \n\nYou see, at this point in time, Kill 'em All was essentially in a league of its own. There were demos of Overkill and Exodus floating around in the bits of time surrounding the release of this album, yeah, but the only other full length album to come out in 1983 that can really be considered a thrash metal album by any stretch was Slayer's phenomenal debut, Show No Mercy, and that was released six months after Metallica's debut. Thrash at this time wasn't really a distinct entity yet, the sound we'd come to have solidified on later albums like Reign in Blood, Eternal Devastation, Bonded by Blood, Beneath the Remains, and other genre defining classics is nowhere to be found on Kill 'em All, but the groundwork is there. There's no denying that the triplet break of \"The Four Horsemen\", or any given section of \"Whiplash\" and \"Metal Militia\" are anything other than some of the earliest thrash metal ever put to tape. That fast, hard hitting grittiness of Discharge mixed with the riffing supremacy of Diamond Head and layered with the attitude of Motorhead; that is how thrash started, and it's a mindset that 97% of these newer \"retro\" bands need to get back to. Before there was a template to ape, Metallica just set forth by blending the stuff they liked. So what we're presented with is a little bit Saxon, little bit Ramones. Little bit Mercyful Fate, little bit Misfits. Little bit Venom, little bit Thin Lizzy. That alone makes this one of the purest tributes to that beloved style of music we all love. Kill 'em All was basically a love letter to all of Metallica's early influences, and in their aim to pay homage to their idols while simultaneously pushing the envelope, they kind of accidentally invented an entirely new style and stumbled into history. Even if they'd broken up or died after the release of this, I'm sure the benefit of hindsight, especially now with the internet, would have granted this album the notoriety it deserves.\n\nAnd that's another thing people, especially younger folks, need to understand. They weren't superstars in 1983. Megaforce sure as hell wasn't Sony or EMG or anything like that, it really wasn't until after the two subsequent albums that they really reached the levels of success we normally attribute to them, and it was even more impressive back then, with how obnoxious and abrasive they were in comparison to everything else American audiences had access to. This is really just me scratching an itch more than anything, but the amount of historical revisionists who go on about obvious ballyhoo like that just drive me up the wall. Mustaine fanatics who get all butthurt about how they took all the success from Megadeth need to realize that they had just as much time to break out, the fact that Megadeth was always Metallica Jr. sure didn't help their perpetual shadow dancing, but that's another rant for another day.\n\nBut the main point here is the music itself, and as I've said dozens of times already, it's a stupendous blend of early rebellious music. Tracks like \"Motorbreath\" really showcase the punk edge and rock 'n roll attitude gleaned from Motorhead (the title likely wasn't a coincidence), while \"Hit the Lights\" could be seen as a double-time reimagining of \"Highway Star\" or \"Heavy Metal Thunder\". Pretty much everything here has something to enjoy, and nearly every song can be picked apart to discern all of the band's influences at the time. But with all that said, I have to say the band's age really does show, mainly in James's vocal performance and lyrics. The former is a positive quality, as there's such an inimitable charm to him shouting his adorable little peach fuzzed lungs out, giving it nothing less than 100%. His squawky yelp is very earnest and resonates well with the spirit of youthful backlash against the establishment. While on the other hand, the lyrics here are pretty inconsistent, and usually pretty bad. \"The Four Horsemen\", apart from making the odd mistake of replacing \"War\" with \"Time\", is pretty solid in this respect, whereas \"Seek and Destroy\", \"Metal Militia\", \"Phantom Lord\" and others just fall completely flat from a lyrical standpoint. Part of me wants to not hold this against them since lord knows I'm embarrassed about the lyrics I wrote when I was 17, but the fact of the matter is that they're here and they've been immortalized, as silly and stupid as they may be.\n\nThere are other kinks that really needed to be ironed out as well, like the painfully dull \"Anesthesia\". Really, of all the cues you could have taken from Battle Hymns, you didn't take the irreverent attitude, hard rocking riffs, or big choruses, you chose the torturous extended bass solo? Literally the only thing about Manowar's first album that I don't like and one of their most irritating trademarks throughout their career has always been that damn stupid, sloppy distorted bass solo that they always shoehorn in. Thankfully Metallica kept it contained to just this first album, so the overall damage was reined in. The track has taken on a life of its own after Burton's death and is often pointed to as evidence of his prowess, when really it's a pretty simple ditty that sounds like it was recorded impromptu in one take. Cliff's strength lied in his melodic sensibilities (\"Orion\" was his baby, and the strange, noodly parts from later albums were his main contribution), not his boring bass jam. I also can't help but dislike \"Seek and Destroy\". I know it's become a concert staple but it just sounds so corny forced that I can't get behind it. It works in a live setting, but here it sounds to me like a dirtier and heavier version of the glam rock bands that Metallica was rebelling against at the time. The main riff lacks urgency and just kind of piddles along lazily. And if I'm being excessively nitpicky (which I am), the first half of \"No Remorse\" feels kind of awkward and not entirely thought out. The second half is strong as hell, with that primitive thrash sensibility shining through a truly venomous vocal performance, it just takes a while to get there.\n\nWith all that said, I have to admit I'm just being extra tough on this since it's such a major album. It's legendary for both noobs and seasoned vets, so it really deserves to spend some extra time under the microscope. Those small quibbles aside, Kill 'em All is a stellar record for pretty much any other reason you can think of. Lars's drumming is technically mediocre, but his one-dimensional style works for what they're doing here. They weren't attempting any long epics like \"Call of Ktulu\" or \"Orion\" yet, they were still just a band of kids, full of piss and vinegar and unleashing their frustration in the only way they knew how. His signature style lends itself to the more punk rock attitude that's so prevalent on this album, and I wouldn't have it any other way. But for my money, above even the great early trad metal riffs being played at blazing speeds, the absolute highlight is Kirk Hammet's soloing. Man this album is just loaded with leads and solos at every possible opportunity, there isn't a single dead spot on the album. And every time he lets loose, he lets loose the goddamn kracken. Slow, emotional solos? Fuck that with dynamite, the goal here is to go as over the top as possible, and holy lord do they succeed. That outro solo to \"Jump in the Fire\" could well be the best one ever put to tape by the band, and the solo break in \"Phantom Lord\" (structured eerily similar to the famous section in \"Hangar 18\" seven years later, just let that swirl around in your heads for a bit, Megadeth loyalists) is fucking furious. Pretty much any song can be pointed to as an example of the blistering leadwork that helped define the band in the early days. Very fast, very melodic, very simple pentatonic flailing that sticks in your head and is instantly recognizable. \n\nKill 'em All is just goddamn impressive, both for the time and today. The hour long runtime (I'm assuming most of you are familiar with the CD version that I also grew up with, which features covers of Diamond Head's \"Am I Evil?\" and Blitzkrieg's \"Blitzkrieg\", both of which are awesome) never drags and pretty much every song remains a classic. Everything here is fun to sing along with, fun to air guitar, and just fun to headbang like a caveman to. It's not a perfect album, to quote a much more recognized and influential writer than myself: \"Even the first wheel was kinda squareish\", but for what it is there isn't much else I could ask out of it. Metallica clearly gave it their all on their first whack at a full length, and it shows. It's primitive but it's clean, and the vibrant production helps the album shine brightly. The fact that I and so many other people whose noses aren't turned up so high that they could drown in a rainstorm consider this timeless isn't an accident. I'm not saying elitist snobbery is the only reason one could not enjoy this album, but chances are that you enjoyed this when you were young and first discovering heavy metal, and the fact that you've since collected every Vomit Sodomy tape and seen Njiqahdda play in a moldy basement in front of six people (including you and their parents) shouldn't stain your enjoyment of it now. Go back and listen to this now, remember how you felt upon first hearing early Metallica for the first time. You'll likely find that you can still find room in the shriveled black stalactite that was once your heart for a little bit of warmth and adoration for a timeless classic.\n\n\nOriginally written WITH A VISUAL AID for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nThey\u2019re trying. Every song on Metallica\u2019s newest album, Death Magnetic, will require Hetfield and Co. to concentrate in order to perform it live\u2026and likely break a sweat. Of course a higher degree of technical difficulty does not mean that the songs actually warrant the furrowed brows and grimaces they will elicit from the band to pull off in the live arena, but the album is undeniably dense and filled with ideas. The production is arguably the best they\u2019ve had since the blazing guitars sound of debut Kill \u2018Em All: the guitars are rich and the drums are thick and roomy with a nice amount of distortion on the snare (kind of opposite the snare sound on the last one).\n\nAssuming that everyone (intelligent) reading this magazine prefers 80s Metallica to the \u201cstuff\u201d that followed, the contrary thing to point out is that Hetfield has continually improved as a vocalist. Even though the Black Album, Load, Reload and St. Anger songs are composed of riffs that sound like reheated Danzig, Kid Rock or post-makeup Kiss, Hetfield continued to develop his voice. He became a crooner with a rich voice and often excellent inflection. (He had to do something while playing one riff for five minutes...) On Death Magnetic, Hetfield\u2019s vocals sound good, but perhaps because of the complexity of the music\u2014 or maybe just a lack of good ideas\u2014 he comes up with far fewer memorable refrains than he did on St. Anger or the Black Album. His best singing is unquestionably in the album\u2019s two most somber tunes, \u201cThe Unforgiven III\u201d and the album zenith \u201cThe Day that Never Comes,\u201d and he has other nice moments (\u201cBroken, Beat & Scarred,\u201d the bridge of \u201cThe Judas Kiss\u201d and the chorus of \u201cThat Was Just Your Life\u201d), but it is clear that this singer\u2019s best ideas are when he is Sensitive Hetfield or Melodic Hetfield, not Tough Hetfield or Forcing-the-Idea-That-Doesn\u2019t-Work-Ah! O-Yeah-ah-ah! Pirate Hetfield.\n\nThe album features the return of Lead Guitarist Kirk Hammett (as opposed to Standing-On-Stage-Bored-As-Hell Kirk Hammett), who was very missed on the St. Anger (and very needed). He does a fine job stomping his wah-wah/bluesy shredding when given his space, and his big solo in the later part of \u201cThe Judas Kiss\u201d (around 6:00) takes a lot of very interesting and creative turns\u2014 it\u2019s his best lead since \u201cDyer\u2019s Eve.\u201d Drummer Lars Ulrich continues with his expressive, deep groove, surprise-accent style of playing that\u2014whether you think he\u2019s a douche-bag or not\u2014 helped shape the genre. Though his playing has flaws (even after digital correction), like Carcass\u2019 Ken Owen, I prefer his performance to many more perfect players: His instincts are great and he distinctively pulses the music without getting in the way (unlike that Tool drummer everybody loves who often makes their music stagnant by omitting necessary snare hits). Good, musical and thoughtful drumming throughout the album.\n\nUnlike the other \u201creturn to the hard\u201d album St. Anger, Death Magnetic focuses on the guitars: This is unquestionably the first time the band has put riffs first since \u2026And Justice For All. Unfortunately, the riffs are largely okay groove, sludge, stoner and bar rock licks played with more distortion and the errant triplet or chugs to make them seem more active/metal. There are some genuinely good riffs\u2014 \u201cThe End of the Line\u201d has one at 4:20, \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d has several (1:59, 2:58, and the bridges) \u201cBroken, Beat and Scarred\u201d has the best riff on the album at 1:00 and \u201cThe Day that Never Comes\u201d has several good ones in the second half\u2014 but mediocre riffs outweigh the good ones by a big margin. This is the ultimate achievement and limitation of this album: Metallica metallicly puts the guitars in spotlight, but the ideas are not quite compelling enough to hold the stage. The vocals and synergistic details, and by this I mean stop-starts and drums/riff interplay, do help buoy things and make it functional metal.\n\nDeath Magnetic is a dense and way too long album that shows the boys can still play tough music well and passionately\u2026even if the ideas are of varying caliber. \u201cCyanide\u201d and \u201cThe Judas Kiss\u201d are duds, \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d is a fun stab at \u201cDamage, Inc.\u201d but with a weak verse section, \u201cBroken, Beat & Scarred\u201d is quite good, \u201cThe Day that Never Comes\u201d is almost great and the remainder of the album is pretty good\u2014 okay riffs bolstered by interesting arrangements, good details, synergy, strong performances and great production.\n\nThey\u2019re trying\u2026and succeeding to some extent.\n",
        "\nOriginally published at http://suite101.com\n\nThere's been an unusual trend in 2011 based around the idea of releasing previously unavailable material. Nile re-released their first demo and Hell completely re-recorded a collection of songs from the 80s for an overdue full-length while bands like Pentagram and Megadeth scanned their archives for a few forgotten tunes to add to their mostly new efforts. In a way similar to Halcyon Way's IndoctriNation, Metallica has put out a digital EP consisting of a series of outtakes from 2008's Death Magnetic. This release combined with the band's recent 30th anniversary shows suggest that the band is trying to do some damage control in the wake of the ill-fated Lulu, but this isn't the first time Metallica has given its fans some rare material. And there's nothing to be cynical about if the music itself is good, right?\n\nFor the most part, it is pretty clear to see why these songs didn't make it onto Death Magnetic; they\u2019re definitely not inadequate songs but rather cut from a different cloth. While that album leaned towards thrash metal, this EP is more hard rock dominated and features a more melodic presence. But at the same time, there are still some elements of thrash on here. The introduction of the opening \u201cHate Train\u201d and the verses on the closing \u201cRebel of Babylon\u201d stand out in this regard though both songs are largely melodic as a whole. \u201cJust A Bullet Away\u201d also has a nice spring in its step though its bouncy riffs are more along the lines of Opeth\u2019s \u201cThe Baying Of The Hounds\u201d than anything particularly neck-breaking.\n\nBut going along with that, the EP is still identical to its parent in terms of production and band performance. The production has that dry tone, the vocals and guitars are solid, the bass gets a few spots to make itself known, and the drums may piss you off as much as ever. Of course, getting used to the production style and knowing how these songs were demos until recently can make a listener much more lenient.\n\nBut like the other Metallica albums that have recently come out, there are points where the songs feel like they are long and complex for the sake of being long and complex. Fortunately it\u2019s not as grating as it was on St. Anger or Lulu but it does keep some songs from being as awesome as they could be. This can best be seen in \u201cJust A Bullet Away,\u201d originally known by its working title of \u201cShine.\u201d This is definitely the EP\u2019s best song and has some great riffs, but it may have been better if the last three minutes or so were cut off. The melodic section does sound nice but it disrupts the flow after the song has come to what could\u2019ve been a great ending.\n\nBut with that said, the songs on here are still pretty interesting and more satisfying than about half of what was on Death Magnetic. \u201cHate Train\u201d is solid though its numerous tempo changes do take some getting used to, \u201cHell And Back\u201d plays out like a more brooding version of \u201cCyanide,\u201d and \u201cRebel Of Babylon\u201d is made unique by its slow, foreboding opening and its jump onto fast, complex ground.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s quite hard to tell where Metallica will be going from here. They may have returned to their roots but Lulu\u2019s jam-oriented sound and this EP\u2019s hard rock leanings lead one to wonder just how comfortable they are with thrash metal. They\u2019ll probably keep building on the heavier momentum but I honestly wouldn\u2019t be that surprised if they went back to a sound similar to that of The Black Album or the Loads. For what it\u2019s worth, this EP is worth a download and absolutely mandatory of those who like its predecessor. Of course, I do wonder why \u201cVulturous\u201d isn\u2019t on here though; the recording I\u2019ve heard is an awesome burst of Venom and Misfits worship. Think they\u2019re saving it for next time?\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\"Just A Bullet Away\"\n\"Hell And Back\"\n",
        "\nAlthough the likes of Venom, Mercyful Fate and Motorhead came before them, forging what became known as speed metal, it wasn\u2019t until Kill \u2018Em All arrived in July 1983 that thrash metal was born. Thrash was a genre of music that by 1988 I was fully immersed in. Always ridiculed by the mainstream press, album covers often featured paintings of skulls, flames, demons and every now and then a shark on a surfboard. Lyrical themes run the gauntlet from serious subjects such as nuclear war, but more often than not were based on horror movies and novels. Perfect fodder for your average teenage boy perhaps, but one step ahead of the pack at all times were Metallica.\n\nOriginally this record was to be called Metal Up Your Ass, the front cover depicting an arm holding a dagger coming out of a toilet bowl. Thankfully Megaforce balked at this concept and requested they chose something slightly less, I would say, embarrassing and \u201ceasier to sell\u201d title and cover. Bass player Cliff Burton, unhappy with being told what to do, chose the title Kill \u2019Em All and aimed it solely at the weak record company execs he felt were afraid to tell it like it was. In the long run though Megaforce did them a massive favour. Gone was the comic feel of the cover and in its place was a blood-soaked mallet fresh from a far more earthy and realistic kill. In fact, the only time Metallica fell into the teen horror thrash trap was when they released the Jump In The Fire single, taken from this album and on the front cover was placed part of a painting from leading fantasy artist Les Edwards, the image taken from the first in his series of The Devils Of D-Day artworks, showing a snarling demon. Whilst not completely at odds with the lyrical themes in the song, it showed the only time Metallica aligned themselves so blatantly with the stereotypical metal fraternity, especially in those early days. For the most part they were treading an uncharted path. I didn\u2019t get to hear this record until after Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets were released, but if I had gotten myself a copy in 1983, I hope that on hearing the final track here, Metal Militia, that I would have instantly fallen in love with this new thrash metal sound, the fastest, heaviest and most- annoying-to-your-parents sound imaginable.\n\nMegadeth\u2019s Dave Mustaine does hold four joint writing credits on Kill \u2018Em All, although he had been kicked out and replaced by the time of its recording and release. It was all down to alcohol if singer James Hetfield is to be believed and Hetfield kicking Dave\u2019s dogs if you take Mustaine\u2019s side. When watching his tears on the remarkable Some Kind Of Monster documentary made some twenty years after his departure, whatever the truth, it does show how rejection from what became the most successful metal band that there has ever been can do to a man. And lets face it, Megadeth became a huge multi-platinum selling group themselves, having a career that until recent years any band in the genre would be envious of. Yet Megadeth were always in Metallica\u2019s shadow.\n\nKirk Hammett, Dave\u2019s successor, fresh from completing guitar duties on fellow thrashers Exodus\u2019 demo, was more than an aliquant replacement. His lead guitar work would inspire future generations of guitarists and bands who needed to add distinct melody to the speed. Check out the furious solo during Whiplash or the off the cuff intro for No Remorse for proof. The solos throughout are clear and the production sound is surprisingly bright, unlike a lot of rock albums released around this time that suffered from a muddy, distinctly '80s thud. Only Cliff Burton\u2019s solo piece, (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth, whilst an excellent showcase for his skills as a bass player, doesn\u2019t hold up too great with repeat listens. Future Metallica albums broke up the frantic pace with bombastic instrumentals or epic ballads. Pulling Teeth serves only as a breather to me. It was to be thirteen years until another filler appeared on one of their records, but with a tight budget that debut albums almost always receive and deadlines approaching, this one less than awesome moment is the only slight on an otherwise groundbreaking lp. The majority of the songs here, in fact you could say the majority of riffs compiled here, have become metal standards that defy age, and although trends come and go in the scene that was spawned from them, they have become for millions of people (and I include myself among these), the bar in which to judge all that came after. Kill \u2019Em All is an essential part of any rock or metal fan\u2019s collection.\n\nIn September 2008, Metallica played London\u2019s O2 Arena and finished the set with Jump In The Fire and Seek And Destroy. A few months later in Philadelphia, Whiplash was included into the set list. These songs not only have stood the test of time, but even today are making an impact on a whole new generation of metalheads. It is clear to any listener that Kill \u2018Em All doesn\u2019t reach the heights of the following four Metallica albums, but as a debut, breaking out from the underground in uncharted waters, this is a monumental document of what potential, not only Metallica, but the whole of thrash, and let\u2019s not beat around the bush here, the whole of the metal scene, would have to offer in the future.\n",
        "\nOriginally published at http://suite101.com\n\nWith the possible exception of Queensryche, there has never been a more controversial metal band than Metallica. Some bands have that one album that divides fans and frequently tops \"all-time worst\" polls but no one can agree on just how many times Metallica has royally screwed up over time. Thus, it's not too out of left field for them to collaborate with Lou Reed, an equally influential performer who has proudly claimed to have scared away the entirety of his fanbase in 1975 with the release of the infamous Metal Machine Music...\n\nSo with this to consider, is this pair's coming-of-age story about a 19th century prostitute who meets Jack the Ripper really such a bad egg? An overwhelming majority certainly thinks so but I am not so convinced. There are still moments on here that make one wonder how it would've turned out if it had been handled differently.\n\nDespite the extreme musical overhaul that occurred between this and 2008's Death Magnetic, one can immediately notice how the production hasn't really changed all that much. The shift away from pounding thrash metal means the worst of the Loudness War glitches may slip under the radar for some but the tone itself still has an uncomfortably dry feeling. It's a minor complaint compared to other flaws on here but it's not the best of signs...\n\nSpeaking of which, the band members' performances don't stand out much, an observation made weirder by this being a very jam-oriented release. There are great guitar moments here and there but the drums only stand out when they're being too intrusive (Fix your kit, Lars!) and the leads and bass are next to invisible! And as everyone has pointed out, the vocals are ridiculous. Reed's burnt-out, spoken word style is surprisingly effective when compared to James Hetfield's howled contributions but there are way too moments where his Bob Dylan meets Christopher Walken voice just doesn't fit. Then again, it's hard to imagine a voice that actually would fit this music...\n\nBut like St. Anger before it, this album's biggest flaw is that it needed to be so much shorter. Both releases have a bad tendency to dwell on and revisit ideas for longer than it is necessary and both really would've benefited from tighter, more focused songwriting. There is no reason why this album needed to be two discs long; if the closing \"Junior Dad\" had been cut by 10-12 minutes alone, it would've been a much more enjoyable track and would've made the album as a whole less exhausting.\n\nBut while the songwriting is poorly constructed, there are some good songs on here. \"Iced Honey\" is easily the best song on here due to it being the most tightly constructed while still having a very laid back feel. In addition, \"Frustration,\" \"Dragon,\" and \"The View\" all have some solid riffs that would've fit a Sabbath-styled doom rock project if they were given a darker makeover. The album also has some songs that manage to present some pretty emotional moments. While they are too long, \"Cheat On Me\" and \"Junior Dad\" are fairly touching and the opening \"Brandenburg Gate\" sets up a somber atmosphere despite all the time James spends warbling about a \"small town girl.\"\n\nAnd like St. Anger, there is one thing that may redeem this release for some people: it's pretty damn hilarious. Even when ignoring all the jokes that have been made about James Hetfield being a piece of furniture, the lyrics are full of unintentional amusement as Reed laments being \"spermless like a girl\" and mutters something about a \"colored man's dick.\" Some will brand the lyrics as being reason to hate this album but they really help give this album character in my opinion. It may have had something to do with me being surrounded by too many hipsters in the English department and thus accustomed to the ways of artsy-fartsy pretentiousness. Whatever it is, it does make for good entertainment...\n\nAs somewhat expected, this is a hard album to properly rate. Objectively, this is a pretty crappy album but there's just some force that makes me want to like this. Along with the new Morbid Angel, this is pretty much the Troll 2 of music: it tries so hard to be deep but you spend more time laughing than reflecting any sort of philosophical insight. If anything, this is a conversation piece that is meant to be discussed rather than listened to on a regular basis. Get it at a cheap price if you want to really join the discussion. If not, at least go buy the new Megadeth album; this may be the one time that Dave Mustaine has actually come out on top!\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\"The View\"\n\"Iced Honey\"\n\"Cheat On Me\"\n\"Frustration\"\n\"Dragon\"\n",
        "\nNobody seems to be able to approach this album without an obvious biais in favor or disfavor to Metallica's most recent work. It seems that we all need to refer to their previous work to try and analyze this. We see it in many various forms. Some say this is Metallica's comeback or not, while others say this is a failed attempt to try and go back to their roots. Generaly speaking, people disliked St.Anger. Some people however loved the album and have defended it through all the shitstorm it went through. My case is particular. I was not huge on metal music back when I first heard the album and I wasn'd displeased with what I heard. It's later that I've digged more into metal and got around to actually listening to the early albums of the band. So if St.Anger isn't one of my favorite albums, it never dropped on my head like a brick like it did to the fans who saw this un-Metallica record released.\n\nConsequently, I didn't approach Death Magnetic thinking \"Will it be a comeback or will it fail ?\" or maybe \"Will they be able to return to their roots ?\" I picked up the album like any album I came across. Not pretending to be a hundred percent unbiased or objective here. But I approached the album without trying to find the old-Metallica in it or ways to perceive elements of St.Anger in it.\n\nAnd with that approach I must say I kind of like the album. It's no thrash metal masterpiece, but it's definitely enjoyable. Sadly though, all the tracks don't share the same quality. Metallica tried with this album to experiment with longer songs, maybe somewhat like they did with ...And Justice for All but with a very forward and straight to the point feel like on Kill 'Em All or Ride the Lightning. Which is cool. But some of the tracks just come out as generic. It doesn't mean they aren't enjoyable, but kind of forgettable. I'm talking about tracks like My Apocalypse, Suicide & Redemption or The Judas Kiss. All of these have well-built riffs, cool thrashy solos, nice vocals, etc. But they do seem to come out as very standard thrash metal tracks. On the other hand tracks like All Nightmare Long, Cyanide and especially That Was Just Your Life and The Day That Never Comes have all the right hooks at the right places, solid riffs, good choruses and manage to be memorable mostly becaue of this.\n\nIn the end, the album is kind of too long, but this is because of very lenghty songs. It wouldn't seem to long if the longer tracks would have stood out more. The Judas Kiss and Suicide & Redemption for instance are the two longest tracks on Death Magnetic, and they feel like fillers to me. The good tracks however are just perfect when in the lenght department. There is also a good use of slower tracks on this record. As all the tracks except for two are straigh-forward tracks with a pretty similar formula, having two slower-paced tracks on the album kind of help to change the mood. The first one comes kind of late on the record, maybe a little too late for my state, but it's a very good track... I'm talking about the single The Day That Never Comes. Very solid track. The second track comes at the end of the album and is supposed to be the third part of The Unforgiven. I don't see much connections between this The Unforgiven III track and The Unforgiven, but whatever. The track has a slow build, reminding of One, but it's never has good as One was. The track in itself is ok. Just ok. I don't particularly like it and it will most likely not end up on my top 10 Metallica tracks list, but it's pretty cool to have a slower track on there to close the whole album and it helps keeping a little variety on the record.\n\nBottom line : I enjoyed the record. It's a good album if you look at it as a whole. Yes, there are too much fillers on Death Magnetic, but some tracks manage to be quite memorable and very thrashy. If Metallica had to build on something for the future, I think it would be Death Magnetic. No point in trying to recreate the early albums, and no point into digging any deeper in the kind of strange rock/heavy metal genre they attempted with Lou Reed. We have with Death Magnetic solid roots to try something new.\n",
        "\nSometimes, at certain gigs, I feel so \u201cun-cool\u201d in my Metallica t-shirt, I really do. I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s now and I really shouldn\u2019t have any self-conscious hang ups at this stage, but the weight of that existential, Metallica hating, pressure within metal circles is immense and undeniable. Nobody\u2019s ever said anything to me of course, but I know it\u2019s so far from the \u201cright band\u201d merchandise to wear; on top of that, I can\u2019t help but think of that kid in the press a few years back, who got put in hospital for having the audacity to put on a Hammerfall t-shirt. Yet, I still risk life and limb and adorn that, still fucking incredible logo, having my apprehension mix with pride. I hold both \u2026And Justice For All, and my adolescence, as a major cause for this exceptional act of metallic gallantry. \n\nYep, that\u2019s a perfect score, right there (something I would only give one other record btw) and it\u2019s for an album that is somewhat grudgingly included in that astonishing run of classic albums by the ex-thrash band. I can indeed see most of the criticisms levelled at Justice; obviously the biggest beef, was/is, the bass been almost completely mixed out, on top of that, the song structures are far more sprawling than before, and it isn\u2019t exactly sing along either, there\u2019s no Creeping Death to shout \u201cDie!\u201d to here. And yet to theses ears it is all totally irrelevant, this is due to that feeling ladies and gents, that intangible, incredible, incomparable, feeling that this record has, even fifteen years after first hearing it. For me, it\u2019s the reason that this style of music becomes part of your life and not just part of your record collection. \n\nThe distant walling strings that draw you into the opener \u201cBlackened\u201d with their cold, mourning cry that suddenly snaps, becoming an urgent, remorseless, crushing guitar sound leading in to a precise and perfectly weighted song structure that every 80\u2019s \u2018tallica transmission is blessed with. Only there\u2019s something else on this record, adding something to a thrash album that I\u2019ve never heard performed as effectively before or since; there\u2019s fear. A genuine and palpable sense of fear is pervasive throughout every note played, it\u2019s compulsive, consuming and (I\u2019m guessing) partly unintentional genius. Yes, this is Metallica\u2019s most complex, heaviest and darkest album and this probably is, as the press usually say, a reaction to the tragic loss of Bass legend Cliff burton. However, underneath all that, I think the three young men left to cope with that loss where actually just scared. Fear is twisted into every song, every guitar cord, every angular tempo change, but instead of dragging the whole thing down it imbues the sound with such vitality. In turn, this vital, powerful, sense of fear which makes the layer upon layer of guitars work, the super complex song structures sync and make the lack of Bass totally inconsequential. It also allows it to trample right over my head and twists its barbs right through and deep inside my heart making it my favourite record of all time.\n\nAll the usual plus points still stand of course; \u201cOne\u201d with its Morricone style opening and hellish cascade of solo distortion is indeed fucking awesome. The Guitar sound is great, Lars probably puts in his best performance, feeling loose not sloppy and it is arguably the greatest of Hetfield vocal workouts too. But still, maybe you had to be there, not the 80\u2019s thrash scene, but my mums house in the mid 90\u2019s, painting crucified soldiers on a, rather terrible school art project, listening to Justice for the first time, but hell, you wouldn\u2019t understand, because you weren\u2019t there. Shame really.\n",
        "\n\"I only like Metallica's first four albums!\" It's a phrase many people have heard when discussing this band. It's a statement usually taken to mean the metalhead in question is truly, absolutely only into metal and will take none of that sell-out crap. That they only enjoy, of course, their early thrash metal albums; the only good Metallica albums. Is it a matter of them being pure and unscathed by the forthcoming commercial breakthrough that culminated in the sell-out albums that followed? Is it because their songwriting and riffwork prowess was inherently superior? Or is it simply because they're metal? Now, I'm not here to make a case for or against those first four; everybody has heard them, everybody knows what they sound like, and consequently everybody has differing opinions about them. Maybe you only like the first two, maybe you only like the debut, maybe you don't like them at all. It's not a big deal, because discussions regarding Metallica aren't very interesting these days. I, for one, like a few songs here and there, but listening to those albums as a whole doesn't do much for me. \n\nIn any case, there's this widely shared view by the metal community claiming that, after ...And Justice for All, the band sold out and began sucking. Maybe some fans still like their self titled, or some tracks out of it, since even if it's poppy and commercial, it's still metal. However, once you get past that point, very few actually find some worth in Load. It isn't a metal album; not at all. It is, at best, a hard rock album with some experimentation with other genres thrown in. Even then, a small group of people still like it, or at least one or two of its tracks. I've even met a person who once claimed it was their favourite Metallica album! Strange, huh? But then it may still be at the very least understandable, since they probably like the new adventurous take on songwriting the band took on the album, or something like that.\n\nBut then you get to ReLoad, and shit hits the fan. \n\nIt's just an album full of Load out-takes, isn't it? Even the band themselves have said so; that it's simply a bunch of songs that didn't make it into the first one, or that it's merely its second half. The result is still the same; it's still one of their least-liked, and certainly their least well-remembered album in general. Hell, I could say most people haven't even listened to it all the way through beyond the first four or so songs. And here's where I have what is one of the weirdest opinions regarding the band, ever: Even though I don't like or dislike their early albums since I would rather listen to much better 80s bands, ReLoad is my favourite Metallica album. In fact, I could say it's probably my favourite commercial album from the 90s.\n\nMusically speaking, it's absolutely fun to listen to; it's catchy, and so focused on the interplay between simple songwriting and simple riffs, that I can only imagine the sad context in which these songs must have been written. That's because, for me, this is where the band truly found a ground that worked perfectly in their favour. After years of writing some rather bland thrash, trying (and mostly failing) to make poppy heavy metal, and then releasing an album full of experimentation in a way that I can only see as a desperate method to find what could end up working for them, they released a straight out hard rock/grunge album which was so far away from what fans could ever expect, that everyone pretty much promptly hated it right away. \n\nThe music is very mid-paced for the most part, for one. However, instead of opting to go for the chug-chug Pantera riffing which was so popular at the time, the riffs are very bluesy, and they have a distinct melancholic rocking sound to them. Load had the issue of being sometimes too ambitious for its own good, as the band weren't used to playing some of the styles in it. However, this one mixes bare bones rock stripped down to elements which were much easier to arrange with a couple of more experimental tracks. As a consequence, there's little to no filler here. Every song has, for the most part, solid main riffs coupled with one or two other riffs that mostly just play off motifs from the main one, giving the songs an overall sense of cohesion. To put it in better terms; on other albums, the band just went way over their heads on what they could accomplish musically, which is why some sections simply don't work out in the end. But on ReLoad, they already had years of experience on their shoulders, and at the same time they were trying out for a very simple approach regarding the riffwork, the songwriting, and their performances. Therefore, they excelled at it by toning it down.\n\nA good example of this improvement via toning down is Lars Ulrich's drumming. He has never been particularly good or interesting as a metal drummer, but he adopted a very minimalist style for both Load and ReLoad, resulting in a performance that not only made much more sense given his abilities, but is also infinitely more enjoyable because his metal background allowed him to play with a particular groove that wouldn't have worked out right if he were a standard rock drummer. The drums also have a very wide resounding sound-space, which allows them to shine without getting too bright like they did on The Black Album. This is especially true for the sound of the kick drum, which is trebly as per usual but doesn't get rough on the ears because there are pretty much no double bass drumming parts whatsoever, aside from a couple of seconds on \"Fuel\" and \"Bad Seed\". And when they do appear, they're slow; giving the music something that I can only describe as a marching feel, instead of the tickticktick produced by the stream of 16th notes that plagued ...And Justice for All. This, coupled by the fact that the album is pretty mid-paced overall, means Lars's performance and sound fits much better than on other albums, actively complementing the riffwork while having a few moments to shine by itself. \n\nThe drumming has a very interesting interplay with the bass. Jason Newsted is a good enough bass player, and he has a very rough tone here. Not only is he able to work around the low end by playing around the drum patterns, but he will sometimes start playing a bass line different from the guitar riffs, but in a way which mixes both the rhythmic and melodic parts. His work on \"Devil's Dance\" and \"The Memory Remains\" is particularly stand-out, as it is the most varied and probably the coolest to listen to, but his dark, brooding bass lines on \"Fixxxer\" are the ones I enjoy the most.\n\nI've listened to this album a couple hundred times already and I always find some little melodies in the background that are so subtle you wouldn't notice them without headphones, and yet so essential that such sections would feel half-empty without them! I have never been a big fan of Hammet's soloing on other albums, but his bluesy style fits ReLoad's theme perfectly. He also tones down considerably on his overuse of the wah-wah pedal, instead opting for a very tasteful mix of bluesy pentatonic scale soloing and slower, more emotional sections. His solos on \"The Unforgiven 2\" and \"Carpe Diem Baby\" are very good examples of this, and probably my personal favourites. \n\nThere are layers of guitars in the background here and there which work surprisingly well, even though they're so subtle you can't actually notice them without actively looking for them. Considering Kirk's career, I would have never thought of him as a subtle guitarist, ever. Early on he mostly just lapsed into weedly-doos and wahwah-wees whenever he wanted, regardless of their place in the songs. Even his work with the wah pedal works out better here because he uses it in a way more reminiscent of a \"voice\" instead of as a way to mask his shitty playing. Take the solo on \"Where the Wild Things Are\"; it's much slower than what he usually plays, it's very short and to the point, and, given the context and theme of the song, his use of the wah pedal sounds downright frightening because of it. \n\nHowever, in spite of the brilliant performances present here, it's the songwriting and arrangements that really do this album for me. The songs are of medium-length on average; not being either too short or too long for the most part, which allows them to build up their themes comfortably. There's a lot of variation, even if at the core it's a simple album! From dumb sing alongs like \"Fuel\" (which I love to sing along to even though more than half the lyrics are James Hetfield shouting the words \"YEAH!\" and \"HEY YEAH!\"), to pretty ballads such as \"The Unforgiven 2\" and \"Low Man's Lyric\", which are actually quite different from each other. The former is the best power ballad in their career while the latter sounds closer to a dark bluesy folk song. I really like that \"All ah want from you is forgive mayeeeeh...\" section on it; which also features something akin to Hetfield trying to do a southern accent or something, which I guess works considering the general vibe of the track. \"Carpe Diem Baby\" is my favourite track off the album because it manages to mix pretty much all of these elements in the fashion of a dark/light interplay. Even if the lyrics are terrible - \"Then make me miss youuu ohh yeaahh~!\"\n\nOn that note, Hetfield's singing lessons really come to shine, with him giving off the single best vocal performance in his entire career. ReLoad uses a big amount of vocal overlays and harmonies which perfectly support the already strong main melodies, and improve a good performance by what is usually a merely decent singer. He gets to sound great on the ballads, and also on even stranger songs such as the psychedelic aforementioned \"Where the Wild Things Are\", where he sounds maddened and despaired, to the Mot\u00f6rhead-influenced (that's right!) \"Prince Charming\", where he sounds downright rockin'. Nevertheless, it's the vocal harmonies that really cut it - I'd be hard pressed to find a section where there aren't two or more Hetfields singing at the same time, exploring both his lower and higher registers which hadn't been very present before. \n\nProduction-wise, I'd say it's the best work they ever did. I'm not sure if there's any aesthetic difference between this and Load's, but they're still both good. The guitar tone sounds crunchy, and way heavier and thicker that what you'd expect from a hard rock album, so that's obviously a plus since the guitar tone has always been Metallica's strongest asset. As I already mentioned, the drums sound huge, but at the same time they sound rich and full of dynamics - you can hear and distinguish the tiniest things, like when Lars hits a hi-hat with more or less strength than usual. The mixing isn't muddy in the least bit, allowing you to listen to every single little detail on everyone's performance - from the low gurgles of the bass, to the guitar picks lightly scraping against the strings. If you look for it, you'll find it. The rhythm guitar doesn't completely overpower the leads as it did on the self titled either, so when the solos come into play, they take the centre stage. \n\nThe album isn't without a couple of flaws, but they're nothing out of the ordinary. \"Better Than You\" doesn't do much for me in general, and sometimes I lose interest during the a couple of sections in the middle section of the album. If you took the best tracks off Load and put them here instead of its weaker sections you would have a hell of an album - but it would also be like 100 minutes long and that would be kind of overkill. In any case, this really is my favourite Metallica album, and it's the only one I actually listen to all the way through on a regular basis. I'm pretty sure I'm all alone here regarding my views on it, but that's okay. I enjoy it whole-heartedly, and I guess that's because I've never been the biggest fan of the band's other works. But enough of that, you should probably give ReLoad a chance, and listen to it in a mood other than \"this is a sell-out album and therefore it sucks because it's not the usual Metallica\". It's a fun little rocking album that manages to remain consistent most of the way through, which is a feat no other album by the band has accomplished so far. The saddest part out of this is that they found the best sound in their career, the one they could be really comfortable with playing, only for most of their fans to completely hate it and lash out against them - no wonder Lars ended up suing them.\n",
        "\nFOREWARD: I decided to revisit Lulu because I felt perhaps it got a bad rap too early and I let that influence my score. So I listened to it again... and now I like it even less. I wasn't being too harsh, I was being far too kind. Anywho, here's the updated review: \n\nMetallica have spent a good chunk of their career now (since the early 90's) making people wonder \"why are these guys famous multi-millionaires?\" Indeed, every album they've made for quite some time has left fans scratching their heads and wondering exactly what James/Lars were thinking. While Death Magnetic was a half-assed attempt to recreate past glory (it resembled a Metallica tribute album more than a proper Metallica album), Lulu is... well... that's the thing. I can't figure out what this thing is for the life of me. It honestly resembles fuzzy atmospheric garage rock (the production is actually quite nice for having been done in 10 days) performed by aging former metal stars with some old demented coot ranting into the mic. If that sounds unappealing, then join the rest of us; this was an experiment, but a horribly done experiment. \n\nOne thing that could've helped is if the process wasn't so rushed. I detect very little Metallica involvement here, and while I'm new to Lou Reed, I'm not new to Metallica, and I can tell what was thought up by Metallica and what wasn't. While \"The View\" might've contained some good ol' fashioned diminished chords, a hallmark of metal, Brandenburg Gate sounds like Bob Dylan with distorted guitars, and I mean that in the worst way possible, and Metallica sound like they're trying to be heavy on a song that really should not be heavy, at all, and it sounds like they heavily mixed Lou Reed's low-key drawl up in the mix to overpower James' generic shout and the noisy guitars, which is most apparent on songs where Metallica tried to be heavy. Note I said, \"tried\", not succeeded. Honestly, if they had spent a little more time collaborating, a little more time brainstorming, and a little more time in the execution process, this could've been gold. This could've been a repeat listen. This could've been Metallica's magnum opus. \n\nBut it's not. It resembles a collision between 2 trains, one labelled Metallica and another labeled Lou Reed. When Lou Reed's voice comes in, it makes me cringe every time, because his lazy \"half spoken, half sung\" style doesn't mesh well with the clanging drums and guitars, with his lazy rhythm suited much better to the strum of acoustic guitars and padded drums, not Metallica's setup. However, the sounds are not offensive, just puzzling. This is coming from someone who listens to experimental music in some sort of fashion a good 80 or 90 percent of the time. I'm not against experimentation in metal; if it weren't for those brave souls who introduced outside elements to the metal sound, metal would've died, suffocated on its pureness. This isn't really all that experimental, though. The traditional Metallica method of lengthening songs by repeating stuff over and over (which they've done on and off since ...And Justice) is in full swing here. I would honestly rate Lulu a good ten or fifteen points higher if they trimmed a good half hour from this album. Long songs wouldn't ordinarily be a problem with me, except for the fact that Lulu is impossible to listen to, appreciate, and listen to again unless you listen to the whole damn thing, because obviously, the biggest component of this album are the lyrics, since they mixed Lou's drunken utterings so danged high in the mix, and because the guitars are so dreadfully boring and repetitive. Many songs simply consist of one riff for most of their duration, and usually it's a horrifyingly simple riff. Let me rephrase that: The average riff you heard on \"The View\" is the best riff on the album. It only goes downhill from there, and the more this album goes on, the more they repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat these increasingly terrible excuses for riffs.\n\nA good analogy would be that if this were food, it would be chocolate covered spaghetti n' meatballs with bits of watermelon and salmon with ice cream on the side. Doesn't sound appetizing, does it? The only reason Lulu gets a score from me at all is because I like the individual parts -- Metallica, at least when they're trying, that is, actually put up a few good moments here, and that James doesn't sound as bad through the mic as on St. Anger I guess is to his credit, and as well Kirk actually solos here, albeit not that well. In addition, I actually like Reed's soothing half-spoken vocals -- just not in this context, and it's when you mix it all together that it becomes impossible to listen to, much like how that hypothetical dish I mentioned would be hard to eat. I will listen to this occasionally, but the problem here isn't that it's supremely inaccessible -- I listen to WAY more inaccessible stuff -- it's that it's one of those ideas that should've stayed as a drawing on a napkin at some restaurant. I suspect somebody detailed the concept of Lulu on a napkin at some restaurant, and then kept on developing the idea instead of simply forgetting it. Some ideas weren't meant to be, and Lulu is one of them. \n\nOn the other hand, Metallica are now a guessing game -- \"Let's see how much Metallica can destroy their legacy next!\" This time, it wasn't so much that Lulu was offensive to my ears (like $t. Anger or Loads) but simply that it's a somewhat ambitious idea, in the sense that it does cross many genre lines, but those lines are not even remotely crossed skillfully, and its put together in too much of a hurry, done by musicians who just don't have the know-how to put something like this together. No disrespect, Metallica, but you should honestly stick to what you're good at. I was hoping they'd develop the direction they took on Death Magnetic and churn out a respectable metal album, but I guess that was wishful thinking, and I'll simply add Lulu to the ever-increasing list of failed Metallica ventures.\n",
        "\nWhere to even begin with this atrocity that is known as Lulu, the re-burger of Metallica & Lou Reed\u2026 Well, we can start with the very first words spoken on the first song \u201cBrandenburg Gate\u201d: \u201cI would cut my legs and tits off when I think of Boris Karloff\u2026\u201d Literally, reading the lyrics for this entire album will speak for itself. If you're one of the chosen few that \"don't get\" Lou Reed's poetry (as James Hetfield puts it), then you are not reading this from the enclosure of a padded cell or closet.\n\nThis is the most god awful album on the planet. This justifies Metallica\u2019s famously horrible St. Anger in every way, to the point that it makes St. Anger sound like Adele. With as much hype as the guys have been giving this album, this by far wins my vote for not only the biggest letdown of the year, but of any hyped up album ever released. If this album doesn\u2019t get worst album of the year, decade, and century, then I\u2019m a one-legged, pissed off Puerto Rican. I can\u2019t begin to express my disgust of the way they fooled their loyal fans looking forward to this turd. I would rather take my $12 to the bank, cash it all in for pennies, go to the nearest sewer grate or manhole cover, and drop one penny at a time, at a rate of 1 penny an hour. I would derive more enjoyment from that then actually listening to this again.\n\nWhat can be said about \u201cThe View\u201d that fellow writer Sammi hasn\u2019t already said? Read that single review Here. To throw in my two cents, it sounds to me that the instruments of \u201cThe View\u201d were recorded onto an LP disc format, but instead of using a stylus to read the music, they used Lou Reed\u2019s nut sack.\n\nIs there any actual musicianship at all within this album? I\u2019m afraid there isn\u2019t. \u201cPumping Blood\u201d sounds like a heavy version of Phish, and yes I use that as an insult because I cannot stand Phish. If you are unfamiliar with them, be glad. They are a crappy jam band, which is what this song sounds like. As a side note, when James Hetfield croons \u201cWhy do I cheat on me\u201d along with Lou on the song \u201cCheat On Me,\u201d it sounds like he stubs his toe every time he says it.\n\nThe angst of millionaires is shown in the song \u201cFrustration,\u201d which, musically, is very much like \u201cThe View.\u201d Minimal musicianship that is re-hashed and re-burgered, Lou\u2019s babbling old man nonsense talk, and the overall effect that somewhere, at this time, everyone who is not listening to this album is having a good life. In about four months, you will be making about thirty dollars an hour. You take a trip to the thrift store and you see this album for the low price of three dollars. Seeing the name Metallica, you are excited at listening to a Metallica album that you\u2019ve never heard before. You get home and you play this on your computer, which kills you a little on the inside. So you actually get upset, and drive the 45 miles back to the same thrift store just so you can get that three dollars back, never mind the fact that you spent about twenty in gas to get there alone.\n\nHave you ever had that moment where you were halfway out the door, when a old man appears (grandpa or otherwise), and continues to talk to you about his life, but he has Alzheimer\u2019s coupled with deliria, so he ends up talking in droves about complete nonsense and won\u2019t let you leave? So you try to interrupt him so that you may continue about your day, but every time you do, he talks over you like you don\u2019t exist? That\u2019s what putting myself in harm\u2019s way for this website by listening to this album was like. It amazes me that no one quit the band during or after the recording of this album due to creative differences. No matter where life takes these individual musicians, Lulu will remain in their shadows for eternity. Hopefully this, in turn, will diminish Metallica\u2019s widely publicized diva attitudes, because this is proof that their shit does indeed stink.\n\nI also admire journalist Chuck Klosterman's review of this, saying \"If Red Hot Chili Peppers were to acoustically cover the twelve worst Primus songs for Starbucks, it will still sound better than this.\" \n\nOh, and to every single reviewer who had the audacity to give this album a positive review and saying that this album is \"important\" because of it's sheer lack of commercialism, you are the biggest hipsters I have ever seen.\n",
        "\nIt's the early 80's. Heavy metal is stronger than ever, and an aura of sleaziness and brutality hangs in the air. Guys like Judas Priest, Maiden and Accept were chugging along strong. But a new breed of metal was in development. Faster, meaner, more vicious. They called it thrash. And in it's infancy it was the rawest, fastest heavy metal the world had been exposed to at the time. Arguably at the forefront of this movement was the great Bay Area thrash attack, including supermen Exodus, Slayer and our stars here today, Metallica. \n\nWhat ever happened to this Metallica? This Metallica was uninhibited, spitfire-ferocious thrash that was ready to ram 50 minutes of metal up your sorry mortal ass and then take 100 more names. Now they play sloppy elevator music while Lou Reed rants about dogs humping and sucking off colored guys. But for just today, let's live it up in the past, shall we?\n\nThe Metallica here oft considered to be the classic lineup. First off is Mr James Hetfield on vocals and the rhythm guitar. His voice is the great, classic thrash style; highly aggressive with lots of youthful, somewhat raspy shouts and semi-growls. His actual singing and chanting is pretty solid too, while his guitar work, while a bit hesitant and held back at times, is still well done. The guy is in love with his fucking solos. Good ol' Kirk Hammett is on lead guitar, and he's probably the strongest here. The guy's a real riffmaster and he just sounds good, heading right into the music without very little flubs. The late great Cliff Burton takes up bass, and when you can actually hear him, he's solid as hell. He can shred the bass, coming up with his own killer riffs while adding punch to the songs' multiple cool solos. Rounding it out is some Danish guy on drums. I don't want be another one to jump on the \"I Hate Lars Ulrich\" bandwagon, but on a technical level, the guy ain't that great. He's very uneven and at times downright sloppy. He has a couple fast fills here and there, but he only really works well drumming by himself. When it comes to drumming along with a speedy Hetfield solo, he obviously can't keep up, so it's just this vague \"tap tap tap\" that somehow gets higher billing over Burton's bass. It works a little on this album, but overall Ulrich is, and always will be, Metallica's weak link.\n\nThe songs all, mostly, kick fucking ass, ranging from bloodthirsty speeders and thrashy epics to an instrumental and even some power metal-inspired moments. Classic \"Jump In The Fire\", which was, along with three other songs, co-penned by one-time member Dave Mustaine, is rife with semi-technical aggression, memorable riffage and some of Hetfield's best vox on the album. A personal favorite is \"Phantom Lord\", with it's all too brief synth intro, sharp guitar work including a handbangable main riff and it's interesting solo with some time changes. Then there's the epic \"Four Horsemen\" with its killer galloping riffage, a number of scorching solos, and some of Hetfield's meanest vox. Let's not forget \"Seek And Destroy\", the least thrashy song on here, but don't hold that against it. It has probably one of the best choruses due to its inherit simplicity and cooless. Some lesser moments include opener \"Hit The Lights\" (which certainly doesn't suck but it's just kinda so-so) and the boring instrumental \"Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)\", which exists as little more than to show off Burton's great bass skills. \n\nOverall, while there are some problems in the performance of the band and that a few of the songs don't stick out as much as they should, this is still a hell of a worthwhile addition to your metal collection. Forget what the band has become and instead try to focus on what they once were: true heavy fucking metal.\n",
        "\nWow.\n\nWhat is the difference between \"bravery\" and \"foolishness\"?\n\nI have no problem with Lou Reed. None at all. He's not my favorite by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't dislike him or what he does. I'm just not a fan. His Rock And Roll Animal album is in my top 10 live albums, for sure, but that's about all of his material I can appreciate in one sitting. He has my respect, truly, just not my admiration.\n\nOkay, everyone seems to know about my long-standing grief over Metallica's hypocrisy, but I honestly try to not let that have any influence over my judgement of any new Metallica product. I mean I actually liked Death Magnetic. Granted, I haven't listened to that in probably 2 years, but still... it didn't suck.\n\nThis does. A lot.\n\nI have absolutely no idea what either party was thinking going into this project. I just do not see what one party would bring to the other party's fanbase to make them say, \"hey, I have them all wrong! This is great!\" Lou Reed is doing exactly what Lou Reed does best... telling stories put to music. I've always considered him more of a narrator than a singer, kind of like Bob Dylan. But the thing is that when he's doing his thing, the music is usually setting an atmosphere which will, if done properly, convey the emotional backdrop for the character study he's putting forth. The problem is that Metallica have absolutely no idea how to tell stories through music.\n\nSeriously, all they had to do was ask Lou, \"hey, what's this song about and what kind of emotion do you want to put forth through the music?\" Seriously, that's it. Oh, and they had to be able to play within those parameters. Instead, it sounds like all that they heard Lou say was \"play something, anything, for 8 minutes, but make it one riff and stick with it.\" Again, this would have been tolerable, but Metallica being Metallica interpreted it as \"play one riff for 8 minutes and start throwing in random ego stroking for no reason to throw off any sort of emotional story-telling foundation you may have been headed towards.\" Mission accomplished.\n\nSeriously, there is absolutely no subtlety to what they are trying to do. Jeez, I actually have no idea what they are trying to do. And poor Lou Reed... All that he's trying to do is tell his little story, but Metallica are so busy ego-stroking all over everything that Mr. Reed feels compelled to start yelling over the music just to try to get his point across. It's embarrassing. Truly embarrassing. Usually I can get at least a chuckle out of hearing Lars trying to be tricky, but here it's just annoying. Listen to the track \"Pumping Blood'\" and tell me what the fuck he thinks he's doing, because it sure as shit sounds like a simpleton who thinks he's a genius.\n\nBefore this came out there were instances of it being called a brave move on both parties parts. But how sincere can such a claim be if the people proclaiming said bravery stand to profit from it if it is indeed successful? Is bravery only applied to actions that have already occurred? If a man crosses a river filled with hungry alligators to save his family while strapped with raw bacon, is that brave or foolish? Does the cause determine the label? I just never saw this as anything but a really bad idea from the moment I first heard about it. You know, if they had such a great time jamming together at that awards thing, then fine, jam away. Whatever makes you guys happy. But if you put it out for public scrutiny then you shouldn't be surprised if EVERYONE starts calling you out on your ego-fueled death race while trying to pass it off as something artistically deep and profound musically.\n\nThis should have been just a simple, fun thing between five musicians that they got together and did and then left it alone. Why did they release this, and who did they release it for? It's not that I don't enjoy musical experimentation. far from it. But this is not an experiment, it's an out-of-control ego trip caught on tape and released for the world to gape at in shock and awe.\n\nSeriously, this is so bad that I can't even hate it. But I can't just refuse to acknowledge it exists from this point forward because it is such a slap in the face of both parties' fan bases that it deserves, nay NEEDS TO BE reviled. Maybe then some egos will be checked at least a little bit at some point in the future. One can hope.\n",
        "\nThis album begins with a lightning fast picked E-Tuned guitars (Hetfield & Hammett) which sets the pace for what the CD is going to be like. Well in this era of heavy metal Metallica was considered not only to be thrash metal, but speed metal as well. Finely produced by Paul Curcio and Jon Zazula, this entire release is something easy to get into if you're a fan of these genres of music. Metallica circa 1983-1988 I'd say put out uncompromising metal which during the 80's was considered pretty extreme.\n\nAs to what road they went during the 90's to present day does not reflect anything at all like \"Kill 'Em All\". It was blatantly obvious with the release of \"The Black Album\" they simply abdicated their thrash metal roots and completely sold out. But focusing on this album, the rhythms and leads are innovative, Hammett simply shredding on lead and Cliff Burton (RIP) puts out his talent on bass with \"Anesthesia - Pulling Teeth\". You could actually hear the bass guitar not only on that track, but all of them entirely. Fuzzy bass tone.\n\nThere really aren't many thrash acts during the 80's that were more innovative in songwriting quality than Metallica. Although I do consider Slayer, Exodus, Testament and Anthrax were also some damn good thrash bands as well. But Metallica reigned superior over these other bands. Musically \"Kill 'Em All\" has guitar riffs that are simply unique, awesome, distorted as all hell and memorable tracks from beginning till the end of the album.\n\nI would consider this album to be one of my most played out records that I've heard, but I still am not sick of these songs. It's a shame that a band that displayed so much potential which is evident on this release all the way up till \"...And Justice for All\". I think that if Cliff Burton was still around they probably wouldn't have taken their thrash roots away and become a total waste musically. Maybe some would argue this but I believe that he would've at least kept them within their thrash/speed metal origin.\n\nThe lyrical aspect of this release has nothing really to do with Satanism, just filled however with hatred towards humanity without any compromise in that respect. Hetfield's vocals go well with the music especially the high-end screams. I don't consider this release their best of the 80's I'd say \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Master of Puppets\" and \"...And Justice for All\" were their absolute best releases. However, this was a beginning for the band and showed their awesome potential at such a young age.\n\nMetallica used to scoff at the idea of making videos. However, after \"One\" came out they began to make more music videos to make more money obviously. That's why I'm reiterating the point that if Cliff was still around they wouldn't have become \"Metallisux\" as coined by most old fans of the group. But \"Kill 'Em All\" is pretty much everything good that I look for in a thrash/speed metal release. If you don't have it already in your archives then I urge you to pick it up ASAP!!!\n",
        "\nThis is the 4th studio release for Metallica while they remained a thrash metal outfit. A more technical approach to songwriting and probably the most out of their entire 1980's discography. At the time, this was the first release that I owned by the band. It really got me into thrash metal. Not only was the music dark, but it showed a more technical approach to their songwriting.\n\nRemaining musically doomish and dreary in terms of the song features, this is probably the heaviest release of theirs. Even though some tracks portray clean and/or acoustic guitar melodies, the actual songs are really depressing. That seemed to be Metallica's focus for this album. This remains to be one of my favorite releases from the band.\n\nAn introduction to this release begins with lead guitar melodies that segues into a much heavier, E-tuned guitar riff for the song \"Blackened\". All of the songs are lengthy. The last track entitled \"Dyer's Eve\" was still well over 5 minutes in length. The tempos for each track vary. Not all of them are downright fast though many melodic especially on the title track and \"To Live Is to Die\". This song was a tribute to Cliff Burton (RIP).\n\nThey remained innovative regarding to the guitar riffs as well as the leads. Kirk Hammett still does a good job in the lead department, though less technical than on \"Ride the Lightning\" and \"Master of Puppets\". Hetfield belts out some seriously heavy rhythm guitar structures. His vocals are more hoarse than prior releases though it definitely accompanies the music and overall atmosphere.\n\nHetfield has a lead guitar part featured on \"To Live Is to Die\". It's not wholly technical at all and I figure that they wanted to create something that fit the clean electric part which takes place in about the middle of this song. Also, the introduction to this track was an acoustic guitar which then flows into more distorted electric parts. Probably their longest song overall throughout this whole album and 1980's discography.\n\nThe title track is lengthy also and filled with clean parts mainly for the introduction but not the entire song at all. There's also a ballad which also became a video. That was something that Metallica wasn't too keen on doing in their earlier days. However, \"One\" was a huge success overall. But mainly to a darker audience. I don't think that they anticipated going mainstream with it.\n\nSound quality wise came out more fluidly than previous 1980's releases. This was thanks to Flemming Rasmusson's contribution for the mixing. The only complaint though would be that the bass guitar efforts by Jason Newstead seemed to be totally void. Hearing all of the tracks and not one of them you can really tell that there's bass included on this album.\n\nThe focus in terms of the lyrics dealt with society, corruption, inner struggles and anger. Hetfield belts out some seriously heavy throat as previously mentioned. He seemed to really sound like a death metal vocalist spewing depressing lyrics in a much greater magnitude. His only cleaner voice is featured during the clean guitar moments for the song \"One\". They didn't do any cover songs at all.\n\nThis album is their last as a thrash metal outfit. As I said previously, it's their heaviest and darkest release ever. The best tracks to hear are \"Blackened\", \"One\" and \"To Live Is to Die\". All of the tracks are noteworthy though. The ones that I mentioned are my favorites. Their songwriting\nhere was probably the most creative though some would challenge this view. A sad farewell to the Metallica of the 1980's.\n",
        "\nFollow up release from \"Kill 'Em All\", Metallica's effort here features 8 tracks of the very most admirable thrash metal to the core. The quality in production isn't the greatest, but it may have to do with the band's financial situation at the time. So, in effect not all of the instruments are heard to a great extent unless you blare the album. Mainly the bass could've been turned up a little bit more because it's barely audible. Nevertheless, Metallica managed to concoct another original thrash metal release. Pure innovation here. Another great one by pretty much the founder of thrash metal genre itself.\n\nThe guitar riffs are wholly impressive, fast paced for the most part, and entirely filled with songwriting genius. The crunch tone of the guitar is very likeable if thrash metal is your favorite genre or even if it isn't. Songs like the title track,\"Fade to Black\", and \"Creeping Death\" are favorites of mine, but all of them are noteworthy and unique. The bands' acoustic guitar use on \"Fade to Black\" has one of the most unbelievably well constructed main guitar melody. No Metallica ballad can surpass that acoustic guitar riff ever. It is impeccable and a pure exoneration of their songwriting advancement.\n\nThese songs aren't very technical guitar wise, but \"Fight Fire with Fire\" is a very fast paced track with riffs unimaginable and very intense. Solos by Kirk Hammett are fast and furious plus very well constructed and consist of wah pedal licks with amazing mixtures of blues influenced technicality. Just about every solo on here is wholly fast and well confounded. All of the tracks have unique song structures that stick in your memory and could never be played out. This goes for the first 5 Metallica releases, then degeneration into pure destruction that was tragic to see such talent go to waste.\n\nJames Hetfield's vocal outputs are intense with less screaming than their predecessor, but still feature the hate fueled lyrics that are mixed with hoarse throat. He sings with a clean voice on the acoustic parts of \"Fade to Black\". However, as the song progresses, a heavier vocal output is exhibited on the crunchy tone guitar. For every song, he is quite angry and intense. The vocals mesh well with the guitar riffs. A moderate use of back up screams are exhibited on here. Overall, every single track has worthiness and some more so than others, which is typical for an album.\n\nThe drums by Lars Ulrich exhibit a great pound into your skull with even some double bass kicks that are featured on \"Fight Fire with Fire\". His executions on each track are well played out and rehearsed to suit the music. Not a track on here lags in this department as Lars has very good skills and mechanics which are well mixed into the production sound. His abilities are far well embraced and utilized on every song. The production/mixing as was previously mentioned wasn't the greatest, but still very worthy of value. Again, I just had a hard time hearing the bass guitar. It's audible only if you crank the volume.\n\nTo reiterate this point, Metallica was pretty much the founder of the thrash metal genre itself. \"Ride the Lightning\" is a very dark and intense album in this genre and shows how well this band matured from their first full-length release. The production quality again is the weakest, but even that is debatable. This album remains to be my favorite release by the band because of its originality and desolate atmosphere. YouTube some of the songs that I mentioned to see what I mean in terms of quality thrash metal galore. If you're a fan of thrash metal and don't have this yet, get it now!\n",
        "\nAnother original thrash metal album that deserves praise from Metallica, but not as much as it's two predecessors. The atmosphere is much less dark than on their previous release entitled \"Ride the Lightning\". The music is still intense and quite unique. The riff structures are somewhat technical, especially if you're a guitarist like me and you look at it from that perspective. The songs are pretty basic featuring an acoustic part on \"Battery\", clean guitar pieces on the title track and \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\". The rest of the album consists of chunky crunch tone guitars that are quite admirable. They are also innovative and intriguing, quite memorable also.\n\nAll of the tracks display an array of various different tempos. I would say that they're filled mostly heavy thrash parts accompanied by James Hetfield's yelling that rightfully suits the music. He sings in a clean fashion on \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium), but for the most part he's pretty effective in orchestrating outputs which are very dark, just not as dark than on their previous album. I'd conclude that he's still angry dishing out these lyrics that are rightfully hateful and destructive. The song structures are pretty basic, but still fast and tough to keep up with them.\n\nThere is an instrumental entitled \"Orion\" that's quite lengthy and features a pause with just a bass lick about halfway through the song. On this recording, it's a little bit easy to hear Cliff Burton's efforts via bass guitar than on their previous release. It's not as distorted as on their debut album, but it still meshed well with music. His talent is unprecedented and it's tragic about his death in a tour bus accident. If he was still with the band, I think they would have never changed their style of music. The real reason why they changed I think was to appease their fans and sell out. The first 5 Metallica albums are good and the rest are just terrible.\n\nKirk Hammett's solos are still fast and furious, just not as technical as on their first few releases. However, I do believe that his efforts are very well constructed and blues guitar based like on their first two albums. He uses that wah pedal a lot, which is especially noticeable on \"Disposable Heroes\" and \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\". As a guitarist, it's tough to emulate his solos because they are quite amazing and very much tremolo picked throughout this album. Just not as technical like I mentioned. Even James Hetfield plays a lead on the title track during the clean tone guitar part.\n\nMy personal favorite tracks are \"Battery\", the title track and \"Damage, Inc.\" All of the songs are good though and the band doesn't compromise. The production is decent with each track well mixed. The drums by Lars Ulrich mesh well with the guitar riffs and his efforts are quite unparalleled. Overall, he doesn't let up on putting in some great work that is in constant unison with the music. Everything in the production/mixing department went well, but you have to really crank up the volume because it's a little bit low which is the only beef that I have with the production.\n\nMetallica put forth a strong follow up album here, though it's less dark, but still considered to be thrash metal. Each song is captivating and noteworthy. The guitars are blended well in both in rhythm and lead segments. The music is catchy and sticks in your head, especially on the chorus parts. Every band member contributed a great deal to the metal community and it deserves praise like it's predecessors. If you don't own it and you're a thrash metal lover, YouTube the songs that I mentioned and hear for yourself what the songs sound like. Own it now!\n",
        "\nAh, this album. One of heavy metal's most famous, and in some places, infamous creations. Like the face that launched a thousand ships, this record led to so much more acceptance of metal plus two billion slabs of crunching groove, groove, groove - I jest. But quite seriously, the Black Album, whether you like, love, adore, dislike, hate, or loathe it, is one of the most important and influential albums in metal and rock history, for better or worse. This is the album where Metallica apparently decided to \"go against\" everything they had supposedly stood for in the '80s musically, that obviously being thrash, although not only do I not think Metallica consciously went against their original, speedier sound, I also doubt many thrash bands from that era would have given a shit about obsessive teenage fans who actually believed there was some kind of genre war going on for 'true metal' or something, bought into the whole thrash vs glam thing, and said things like: \"I hate glam, it's for pussies! I listen to thrash, I'm a real man!\". \n\nThen again, there was Lars Ulrich's famous quotation, \"Fuck MTV! We'll never do a video!\", and then they ignored that and did one with One (pardon the repetition and pun) from ...And Justice For All. There's no doubt that Metallica often shot themselves in the foot by saying one thing and later doing another entirely. I don't think the Black Album was ever meant to be perceived as an attack on what Metallica used to be though, and I certainly don't consider it to be that.\n\nStill, as much as I find the whole phenomenon of \"thrash purism\" to be somewhat ridiculous and over the top at times (although in its own twisted way, is also admirable in its dedication), it isn't hard to understand why Metallica's hardcore fan base might at the very least have been rather surprised when they first heard \"Enter Sandman\". Sure, it's heavy as hell with a pounding rhythm that commands you to rock hard, but it's also slower, a little easier on the ears, and nowhere near fast or aggressive enough to be thrash. \n\nThen again, this isn't a thrash album. Metallica was tired of making epic, progressive stuff, and after the grueling recording process of ...And Justice For All, who wouldn't be? They knew that they could never keep that up, so what did they do? They made this album, a pure heavy (as opposed to thrash) metal one, chock-full of anthems related to the subjects of darkness, voices in one's head, touring, and religion, along with a couple of epics about girls and difficult childhoods. All typical rock and metal subjects, but the interesting thing is that they weren't done in the manner of bands like Maiden or Priest. It was different, more focused on ultra heavy, groovy rhythms and less on classic metal melodies and the '80s style of songwriting.\n\nGoing back to how many thrash fans must have felt when they heard this album for the first time, again one has to admit it is a little extreme for a band that once claimed to hate MTV so much that they'd never do a video to go completely the other way and make not one, not two, not three, not four, but FIVE videos, five singles, and five hits (or more, if you count some of the other songs on here).\n\nSo yeah, for a portion of the fan base to harbor feelings of shock, distrust, and even resentment towards the band is understandable, but at their roots, did Metallica not always have as much classic metal and rock in their veins as they did thrash? In fact, they obviously couldn't have had thrash in their veins since they virtually invented thrash. It came from an amalgamation of various sounds. I'm speaking more broadly of influences as opposed to actual music. Along with their more NWOBHM-influenced material early on, including some of their most famous songs such as Seek and Destroy, plus many other factors, Metallica also had their slower songs and ballads which many other thrash bands didn't even bother with.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that in my opinion, Metallica were never just a \"pure thrash\" band and nothing else. Sure, they had that sound, but they always had diverse influences and were never afraid to experiment. And that, perhaps, in a nutshell, explains their enduring popularity. I don't particularly like what they did with Load and Reload even if I consider them to be decent albums, because it did seem less like innovation and more like cashing into the alt-rock trend, and also the fact that they were actually saying garbage like \"heavy metal is dead\" at the time. However, Metallica have always played many different styles of music, all rooted in either heavy rock or metal. Diversity, I feel, is a good thing so long as one doesn't completely lose sight of one's prime influences. And at the time that this album was released in '91, I don't think Metallica had done so, they were simply streamlining their sound a bit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What happened later is another story, even if I don't care that much.\n\nBut I digress. Enter Sandman, that tune that so quickly became one of metal's most famous songs, is just the beginning of the ride. An anthem if there ever was one, but what comes next?\n\n\"DUN, DUN DUN DUN DIN! DIN DUN...\" etc.\n\nFollowed by a brief silence. \n\nThen a drum roll, and it begins. Something heavy enough that when played at high volumes, it's like a skyscraper falling slowly, but deliberately onto one's head, beating you senseless again, again, and again, a monster groove of mammoth proportions, if little complex, not that this matters. Sad But True, people. A song that crushes like Black Sabbath's slowest and heaviest songs with more of a groove and a really thick, bassy sound. Catchy? Hell yeah, but so are Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio, etc, and the type of metalheads who refute every thrash, death, or black metal band that's remotely catchy still barely have a single bad thing to say about those bands apart from Priest \"selling out to the glam scene\" with Turbo. This points to a rather odd aspect of some extreme metal fans' behavioral patterns; for those who take music a little too seriously, basically, the 'code of true metal' goes something like this: it's not alright to be catchy if you're an extreme band, 'cos metal is generally underground, not mainstream, and being catchy is selling out, but if you're a classic metal band, somehow it's acceptable and even wanted. \n\nFunny, that. \n\nIn any case, Sad But True was another of this album's big hits and it's not hard to see why. I can imagine the band sitting down and working out how they could write a really bottom heavy song in terms of riffage, yet still keep it catchy and accessible. Indeed, Sad But True is dominated by simple pentatonic and phrygian melodies, with the main riff a crushing piece of low, groove-based metal. And yes, like Enter Sandman, compared to songs such as ...And Justice For All's title track, this is ridiculously simple.\n\nAnd in this case, that's the beauty of it. Heavy metal, like every other genre, doesn't always need to be more intellectual, thoughtful, progressive, or complex than other music. Of course it can be, and that's welcome too. However, plenty of the best metal songs are fairly straightforward, Accept's Balls to the Wall and Maiden's The Number Of The Beast being just two famous examples. Sad But True is remarkably unfettered, content to be a crushing rocker with a killer groove and little else, and that's why it's my favourite song on the album. It's not pretentious. It's just there. The bass rumbles, the vocals are a vicious snarl, the lyrics are sinister, and the solo is good. \n\nI think I've got my main points across with these two songs; they define most of what follows, so there's no need for excessive details. Holier than Thou is another straightforward song, almost a thrasher but not quite, and aside from the unnecessary cussing, it's pretty good. The Unforgiven isn't on the same level as One, (Welcome Home) Sanitarium, or Fade to Black, but it's still a great song with excellent use of dynamics, an interesting reversal with the heavy verses and soft chorus, and a strong atmosphere. Wherever I May Roam is another more epic track, fairly straight but with interesting use of phrygian and harmonic minor scales, a cool sitar intro, a great performance by James, and another strong solo. Don't Tread On Me is a crushing groove-based track much like Sad But True, quite similar to what Pantera had already started with Cowboys from Hell, but even more similar to what followed two years later. If you ever wondered where they got inspiration from, I'd wager strongly that a lot of it was the Black Album's heaviest and slowest numbers. Again, for better or worse, it may not be true, but it seems that way to me.\n\nThrough The Never is a throwback to Metallica's old days, a vicious thrasher with really dark lyrics and an angry, nasty feel. Not a bad song, but pretty nondescript and ordinary. And of course we have Nothing Else Matters, one of Metallica's most famous and infamous songs, both for good reasons. It's a gentle ballad, probably the most purely positive song Metallica had written at that point in time, and a love song too; not something that went down well with the kind of strict thrash fans who hated glam. At the same time, it's one of Metallica's most popular songs. It all depends on your perspective, I guess. Melodically speaking, by most standards, it's very well written. Not my favourite song, but again, it generally just works as what it is.\n\nAround this point is where the album does trail off a little bit with the rather unremarkable Of Wolf And Man. There's nothing much I can say about this song as it's just a heavy metal song with elements of thrash and doesn't really stand out at all. Thankfully, this is almost immediately redeemed with \"The God That Failed\" which is another groove-based monster with the guitars tuned down half a step for extra heaviness. Like Sad But True, this song simply bulldozes everything in its path with those deep, low riffs and works by virtue of its sound. I believe this song is about James' mother and her beliefs which, from what I've heard, led to her death. lt's therefore very personal, but obviously James felt it was appropriate. A powerful, crushing song, regardless.\n\nFinally, we get the interesting, if not overly slow and miserable (no pun intended) My Friend Of Misery, followed by the semi-thrasher The Struggle Within. Considering what came before them, I wouldn't say either song is fantastic, but the former is quite unusual and the latter is a nice way to close the album, if unremarkable. Nothing special, still there are more than enough strong songs beforehand to make up for this.\n\nSo that's the Black Album. A record with an enormous legacy that both broke Metallica hugely into the mainstream and also alienated some of the band's fans who only wanted thrash, thrash, thrash, and more thrash! Again, that's fair enough, and I'm not saying anything bad about anyone here, but I am saying this: look at the direction Metallica was already taking with Ride The Lightning. That album was a huge progression from the \"pure thrash\" of Kill 'Em All. And then Master of Puppets, the first thrash album to gain truly enormous popularity, also a very accessible album in its own way. Even \u2026And Justice For All had its more commercial tracks. \n\nAs for the Black Album, it was and is indeed far from either a thrash album or an underground one. At the time, though, it was simply a step towards greater accessibility, dropping much of the band's more extreme edge while retaining their variety. \n\nThis album is a landmark whether you love or despise it, a pivotal record in the heavy metal genre overall, to be either treasured or hated (depending on your point of view; I suppose it's really about how seriously you take the underground aspect of the genre, how much you cling to certain sounds, and how much you enjoy the more commercial side of rock and metal) as one of the records that really brought heavy metal into the rock mainstream (as in, heavy metal that wasn't glam) and properly legitimized an entire genre, won millions upon millions of new fans, made Metallica into a household name, and, if songs like Sad But True, Don't Tread On Me, and The God That Failed were any indication, paved the way for an entire new style of metal that would be popularized by Pantera, a band both loved and hated by many. But a lot of all this, I think, is related to the belief in some circles that \"the '80s rocked, the '90s sucked!\", though. \n\nThe '90s were certainly different. It's as if everything slowed down, became groovier, simpler, grungier, and darker, with less flash, less bright colours, less over the top singing and styles, less shredding, etc, while displaying more angst, more thuggish attitudes along with rapping in the case of nu-metal, more resentment towards parents and politicians, more political correctness, and general darkness. It's not hard to understand then how many old school thrashers may have felt, plus many glam fans, classic metal fans, etc. So going on the assumption that the \"hated\" part is really about the sounds you enjoy and more a symptom of the \"love the '80s, fuck the '90s\" mentality, it's fair enough.\n\nStill, this also means that if you look at it with a different attitude, the only negative aspect of the Black Album's legacy doesn't have to be a negative. It becomes one only if you cling to the dream that Metallica should have stayed with their original thrash sound, and thus never made it truly massive commercially as they did. Since that isn't what happened and they are still one of the biggest metal bands of all time, again, for better or worse, nowadays, I just shrug, put on Sad But True, and resume slow headbanging, or maybe \"head-nodding\" in this case.\n",
        "\nOne thing that must be granted to Metallica, they are honest to the point of sheer brazenness. Sometimes they outright suck in the process, sometimes everyone wonders just what the hell they were thinking, but if one seeks a band that is a veritable open book, this is the gold standard. Perhaps the only exception to this brutal honesty is with themselves, as apparently James and company have been laboring under the delusion that they\u2019ve put out decent music to any real degree in the past 15 years. Some argue the nadir was \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, others will point to the Dadaist abortion from not too long ago in \u201cLulu\u201d, but it is a foregone conclusion that the Metallica of the 80s or even the watered down one of their commercial self-titled breakthrough has been AWOL ever since.\n\nIn light of this, the read on this little slab of leftovers from 2008\u2019s mediocre attempt at straddling the past and present \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d is a bit cryptic. It presents a band that seems to either be trying to kowtow to the lowest common denominator of rock radio, or utterly clueless on how to pick which songs to show and which ones to throw. The entire contents of \u201cBeyond Magnetic\u201d all but blow away 80% of what was on the final product of the sessions these came from, bearing a closer resemblance to a thrash sound, albeit from a modern perspective. Nothing on here resembles anything before 1992, nor does it quite fit in with the band\u2019s subsequent eras. A few riffs here and there (particularly a fragment of \u201cHate Train\u201d which sounds a lot like \u201cFuel\u201d) are familiar, but analogies to anything other than this simply being leftovers from the session it came from, and they taste better than the first sitting did.\n\nUnfortunately, these better songs suffer from the same problem that the rest of the finished session material did, Lars Ulrich and Rick Rubin. The production on this EP is outright flat from a mixing standpoint, sounding like a band playing in a closest with no sound reverberation compressed to the point of sounding robotic. Lars\u2019 kit is obnoxiously loud, particularly whenever there\u2019s a crash cymbal hit, and while he isn\u2019t missing a beat, the grating and dead sound of his tracks sound like a cheap student beginner drum set. Granted, the riff work is mostly solid, particularly during the faster sections of \u201cRebel Of Babylon\u201d, and Kirk peppers all of these songs with fast and pretty substantial lead guitar work, but the lack of depth in the overall sound trips up what could almost be qualified as a respectable release.\n\nIronically enough, as was the case with the lackluster \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d, this is the best thing that Metallica has put together since \u201cThe Black Album\u201d, which is more a testimony of how bad everything else has been aside from it that anything else. It\u2019s passable by the standards of a modern metal album, and Hetfield\u2019s vocals are surprisingly better than they\u2019ve been in a long time. But it would do this band a world of good to rein in Lars\u2019 volume knob on the mixing board (not to mention that knob personality he\u2019s been sporting for far too long) and to find a producer that doesn\u2019t tolerate this band trying to compete with Nickelback and Creed over who can sound the most obnoxiously loud. The verdict here is buy with reservations, or roughly translated, buy it cheap.\n",
        "\nMetallica has a fanbase that has, for their entire existence, been pretty much all about jumping ship. Some claimed to only like Mustaine\u2019s contributions, some claim they were lost when Metallica did their first slow song (\u201cFade to Black\u201d from Ride the Lightning), some were lost with the progressiveness of Puppets, the loss of Burton, the Rawness of Justice, the commercial sound of the black album, the bluesy sound of the Loads, or the stripped back awful St. Anger sound. Regardless of what this band does, there\u2019s going to be a group saying \u201cMetallica is ruined forever,\u201d as well as a group saying everything they do is gold. But I don\u2019t think even St. Anger received as much backlash as their collaboration with Lou Reed, Lulu. A lot of people really seemed to feel that was the last straw. Metallica was pretty much over. Despite a warmer reception for Death Magnetic, it wasn\u2019t enough for Metallica to regain the metal community, and Lulu finally burned that bridge. So, under the pretense of celebrating their 30th anniversary, but more likely as a form of damage control, Metallica released an EP of four tracks that didn\u2019t make it to Death Magnetic. How does this apology fare\u2026?\n\nThe album kicks off with Hate Train, which has an intro that, just as it feels like it\u2019s going to drag, starts to thrash, and at about :50 seconds in has what I consider to be a pretty sick solo. Unfortunately, just as the track begins to thrash, albeit with a riff that sounds like the concept was \u201clet\u2019s take the riff from \u2018Fuel\u2019 and make it thrashy, James somewhat ruins what promised to be a small victory with the line \u201cHATE!! IS A TRAIN!\u201d This line signifies everything that has been wrong with Metallica for 20 years with me. See. I was ok with Load and Reload musically, probably because I listened to The Black Album before Master of Puppets, so it wasn\u2019t really a shock to me. But my problem with every album since the Black Album has been the lyrics. From \u201cHEY! Tie your tap shoes tightly,\u201d to \u201cMy lifestyle determines my deathstyle,\u201d to \u201cLOVE Is a four letter word,\u201d they\u2019ve gotten progressively worse on a lyrical front. You\u2019d think that after James\u2019 face being photoshopped onto a table hours after premiering \u201cThe View,\u201d they\u2019d think these lines out a little better. Especially considering that wasn\u2019t even the goofies line on that album (\u201cI would cut my legs and tits off\u2026\u201d \u201cI Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute\u2026\u201d). Sure, Lou Reed was in the driver\u2019s seat, but Metallica was in the vehicle, and their name is on the product. And they supported that music and those words, to the point where Lars claimed he cried listening to it\u2026 And \u201cHate!! Is a train!\u201d is almost wallowing in parody. How about Apathy is a Greyhound Bus? Anger is a Soccer Mom\u2019s Minivan. Sympathy is a Tugboat. And some band needs to rerecord this as \u201cSNAKES!! On a Plane!\u201d\n\nAnyway, The track slows down to a groove riff and goes back and forth between this and the thrashier riffs, though with nothing feeling too out of place, even the slowed down \u201cYou took away tomorrow\u201d part. Another note. James\u2019 voice. A lot of people hate how it sounds these days, and especially hate his newfound attempts to sing. I really don\u2019t mind his singing voice though. The problem I have is somehow, when he TRIES to sing with a bark or growl, he just sounds wrong. He does need to stop accenting added \u2013Ah\u2019s and ooh\u2019s, like \u201cDESCEND-AH!\u201dand \u201cSTAND-AH!\u201d He really never did this until the 90\u2019s, and even then it wasn\u2019t like this. It\u2019s like he\u2019s doing it BECAUSE it\u2019s become a trademark, not fully realizing the parody it\u2019s becoming. Hate Train\u2019s solo is decent, though there\u2019s a part I refer to as the \u201crailroad crossing\u201d riff, which is almost so goofy in a goofy song goofily named Hate Train that it\u2019s almost a joke. But that riff at about 5 minutes is heavy as hell.\n\nJust a Bullet Away isn\u2019t nearly as thrashy, but is decently heavy, with Lars attacking the drums almost as though he cared. He needs to kill the Kick-Snare-Kick-Snare formula though. The lyrics remain silly \u201cSuck on the barrel, suck until it\u2019s gone dry, for all reflections look the same in the shine of the midnight revolver.\u201d At 4 minutes it ends abruptly and you think, \u201cwell that was a decent song,\u201d and then after a quick pause, it goes \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d and gives us a pointless slow part, except where I liked the slow part in Puppets, this feels pointless, and just to pad the song out, since every thrash band from the 80\u2019s seems to think they can\u2019t write a 4 minute song anymore, cause long songs are the shiznit. It goes back up to midpace and kind of half-asses its way across the finish line. Similar sentiments can be said for \u201cHell and Back,\u201d however it\u2019s a generally better song, and so far, has the best lyrics on the EP: \u201cAnd when the sun goes hellbound, And the moon does resurrect the night, I'll hide within her, Not much good has come out the light\u2026\u201d overall it\u2019s not poetry, but a lot better than some of the crap lyrics they\u2019ve put out recently. \n\nThen comes \u2018Rebel of Babylon.\u2019 Just When you thought this album was going to wallow in mediocrity, comes a track that should have probably been on Death Magnetic instead of say, Suicide and Redemption or even Cyanide or Judas Kiss. This song almost captures, during the verses, the fact that Metallica were once a thrash band. And during the verses, has a decent groove riff with a catchy enough chorus to keep you until the thrash comes back. The song remains interesting through the instrumental section with various riff changes eventually going back the thrash riff it began with. This is defiantly beats out some of the weaker tracks from Death Magnetic. \n\nOverall, the EP drags in some places, the two middle sounds could have been shorted, and the lyrics to Hate Train re-written, but this sounds similar to Death Magnetic, making it decent outtakes to a decent album, serving less as a 30 year anniversary celebration or a new release and more as a reminder that even though they experimented with Lou Reed, they still, presumably, plan to once again get in touch with their heavier side when they next return to the studio. I guess. Or they plan to record Load 3: Unload, and this is just to fuck with their already volatile fan base.\n",
        "\nWith \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d, Metallica heavily tried to satisfy many fans from the old days that were disappointed with the more experimental records the band had done before. This album goes back to the thrash roots of the band and could have been the successor of the band\u2019s masterpiece \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d but it ultimately isn\u2019t. The only comparable basis of both records is the bad sound and production but they also differ in this point. While \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d had a very thin production with a bad drum sound, \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d sounds overproduced and is a perfect example for the loudness war trend. \n\nThe band simply isn\u2019t able to go back to the power, originality and authenticity of the early days. Most of the songs are still enjoyable but offer nothing we haven\u2019t heard in a similar and often better way before. The riffs feel worn out, the song structures are predictable and the pieces themselves are often too long and miss the point. The second half of the record is slightly more experimental but not in a good way. \u201cThe Unforgiven III\u201d is absolutely unneccessary and can\u2019t catch up with the previous two parts at all and \u201cSuicide And Redemption\u201d might be the worst instrumental track the band has ever done and is artificially stretched to an unhealthy length of almost ten minutes. The experiments are missed but at least the band still knows how to write good thrash metal songs.\n\nAfter all, there are some highlights in the first half of the record. The first single \u201cThe Day That never Comes\u201d sounds like a modern copy of \u201cOne\u201d but as I liked the original track, I also like the new one that mixes a very melodic first half with an energetic thrash shredding passage in the second half. I can understandthe low rating of the song as it isn\u2019t very original but I must admit that this track is catchy and very emotional and convinces with its traditional charm.The best track immediately follows with \u201cAll Nightmare Long\u201d, a great thrash song with a lot of energy that never gets boring in comparison to many other overlong tracks on this album. The song has some really sharp riffs, amazing guitar solos, fast and energizing drum parts and a very good vocal performance even if James Hetfield even adds more than before some \u201cehh\u2019s\u201d and \u201caah\u2019s\u201d to his words. Even if this has somewhat become a trademark I would like \u201cJames-eeh Hetfield-ahh\u201d to stop this as it sounds quite silly on a full album. The third and last highlight of the record is the next track called \u201cCyanide\u201d. It\u2019s a slower track with a nice pumping bass line and a groovy feeling and an intensely menacing atmosphere that copuld have fit on the records of the nineties as well as on the records of the late eighties.\n\nIn the end, Metallica offer nothing new but throw in some solid and catchy thrash metal tracks where the band goes back to the roots. This record is a decent effort and surely has its moments. Most of the the songs are energizing and work very well in concert, too. The record has a great flow and clear line and might please to a larger fan basis than the previous albums. On the other side, the band though threw almost all experimentations and variations overboard and can neither surprise the fans nor catch up with their first four records while the modern loudness war sound ruins a certain charm that this record could have thanks to the overrated Rick Rubin.\n",
        "\nAfter the disaster piece \"Lulu\" and the overall very negative reactions, Metallica try to beg for pardon with this release and want to underline their thirtieth anniversary at the same time. During their four anniversary concerts in San Francisco, the band presented a brand new track each night and released this EP with the four tracks exclusively a few days later. What we have here are four tracks that didn't make it on Death Magnetic. They exactly sound like the overall sound of this record and have a quite mediocre production by the overrated Rick Rubin. \n\nWhen we listen to the songs, it gets quite clear why they didn\u2019t make it on the record back at the time. The tracks sound too alike to many solid tracks on Death Magnetic and desperately try to sound like the band's early thrash albums, but horribly fail. The tracks have more or less memorable riffs, always the same vocal ranges, quiet inaudible bass lines, and a mediocre drumming that sounds too loud and present once again. After a few minutes, everything is said in the songs but Metallica need to stretch them too artificially epic lengths. In fact, many old metal bands seem to think that long tracks are epic tracks but they're all wrong. I miss the band's ability to write short and sweet killer tracks like \"Fight Fire With Fire\", \"Battery\", or \"Dyers Eve\". \n\n\"Hate Train\" is an overall solid track, but sounds like a stretched version of \"Fuel\". What really annoys me about the track is the pronunciation of James Hetfield. He always sings in a very artificially aggressive way and adds the letter \"a\" to many of his words like \"stand-a\", \"you-a\", \"send-a\" and so on. He always had this tendency, but it just sound too ridiculous on this one. Maybe he should take some lessons in speech and language pathology and correct this strange trademark.\n\n\"Just A Bullet Away\" should have ended after four minutes, but has an unnecessary melodic break that destroys the dynamics of the tracks and leads than back to the original style. This is as predictable as it is boring. \n\n\"Hell And Back\" starts promisingly, but turns around worn out riffs again after awhile. The whole tracks sounds as if the band had recorded two minutes of music and aligned the same bit two times for a length of four minutes before another predictable bridge with a guitar solo kicks off as in any other standard Metallica track from Death Magnetic or the early days. The chorus is repeated as often as in some tracks on Lulu.\n\n\"Angel Of Babylon\" starts off slow, then kicks off as another fast-paced thrash track, but when I start to get bored the song has some interesting breaks and variations without losing its energizing spirit. The vocals especially show some great efforts and are quite catchy. We even have a little bass solo line in this track, but once again the band could have shortened this track about two minutes or so. Nevertheless, this song is without a doubt the best one on here and is the only one that should have made it on Death Magnetic instead of, for example, \"The Judas Kiss\". It's not an excellent classic, but surely a pretty good song.\n\nIn the end, this is a rather mediocre attempt to beg for pardon, but for most of the fans this strategy worked surprisingly well. People easily change their minds. After \"Lulu\", many never ever wanted to listen to this band and now everybody says they are back in strength. I can't agree on this. We have three mediocre and one quite good song. The tracks suffer from their useless length, their bad production, and their similarity to Death Magnetic. In the end, I would only recommend this release to diehard fans as anybody else might skip this and listen to the better tracks on Death Magnetic instead. There are too many flaws on here to say that this is a worthy release.\n",
        "\nFor many years, Metallica didn't release any live release but during the last years, they even release too many DVDs, Live EPs and similar stuff and it's hard to point out which of all those releases is worth to be purchased and which one is not. Even though many of these release are officially only available in a limited number of countries, there are many exceptions and you can still easily purchase the stuff on the internet. The DVD we have here has officially been released in a couple of countries in Latin America but I have been able to buy this in my local music store for a good price. Without a doubt, this is a worthy and quite intimate release and maybe one of the best choices for you among the other stuff that has been released recently.\n\nThe sound quality is excellent on this release and the images are pretty good as well even though I have seen better productions. The Mexican crowd is energizing and incredible as always. The stage decoration is almost inexistent but that has almost always been the case for Metallica. The performance they deliver in here is so energizing that you simply don't need anything else to change your mind and feel the atmosphere. The only negative point is that the camera cuts too often and the live document is especially filled with too many quick zooms that make the whole spectacle difficult to watch. But once you're used to this, it gets better as time goes by. \n\nIn my opinion, the set list is also very well chosen. With the exception of \"Load\" and \"Saint Anger\", a track from every other regular studio album album is performed on here plus a good cover version of Killing Joke's \"The Wait\". The choice for the tracks from the last album is pretty excellent and includes the incredible high speed thrash monster \"All Nightmare Long\", the great classic half ballad \"The Day That Never Comes\" that kicks off very slow, calm and atmospheric to finish with a true blast and the slower and more groove orientated banger \"Broken, Beat And Scarred\". These tracks are probably my favourite ones from the last output along with \"Cyanide\". Apart of that, many classics from Metallica's discography are included and the concert even kicks off with three songs of the masterpiece \"Ride The Lightning\" which is one of my favourite Metallica albums. The only thing I might criticize on here is that the recordings of the tracks are not from the same day and concert but are a mixture of the three different shows at Foro Sol in Mexico City. You can see that the colours of the guitars, the clothes and the crowd changes if you pay enough attention to this document. The performances are still amazing but I would have preferred the even more energizing flow of one single evening shot in Mexico than this very good but not perfect and somewhat odd potpourri of different show snippets and documentary passages which is the final result.\n\nThis DVD also features some filming material from behind the scenes of the concert featuring interview passages with band members and fans and a couple of great and intimate impressions where we can learn more about the band's ideology and pride and the passion of their fans. As the concert itself is truly glorious, the name of this recording is indeed very well chosen.\n\nThe only other negative point is that these passages are packed within the songs of the concert and can't really be seen apart of it as an extra. This hasn't been the best choice because it strangely interrupts the flow of the concert. Even though both concert and the documentary passages are interesting and appealing, the mix of both of them doesn't fit together in my opinion. Iron Maiden have shown with \"Flight 666\" how it should be made and Metallica should have released one DVD with the concert only and another one with the documentary passages.\n\nIn the end, we only have three little negative points but many positive aspects concerning this release. I would still chose this document rather than \"Fran\u00e7ais Pour Une Nuit\". The set list is outstanding, the crowd is simply amazing and the band is in absolute top form. Note that a limited special edition of this release even contains a second DVD with more songs that have been shot during several days at the same location. A few rare and interesting gimmicks have been played and it's a sad thing that Metallica didn't decide to release this extended edition all around the world but I guess this was strange management decision to make more money and appeal to more collectors and diehard fans.\n",
        "\nI'm still not sure where I stand with Lulu in it's entirety- anywhere from 50-70%'s likely. However, I rather enjoyed this song and the need to be an apologist is just too great to deny, so the lead single from the album will suffice while I gather up my 3 or so brain cells and try to come up with a coherent defence of the full length. The album as a whole is one thing- hard to listen to, repetitive, a long album which perhaps asks too much without offering enough in return- but I felt the reaction to this track at least was pretty much really hard to understand.\n\nWith the exception of Junior Dad and Iced Honey, this is probably the track where everything fits best on Lulu; where Reed's senile old man ramblings fit the music best, where the simple, repetitive compositions work right, where the result is at once something dark, arty, and enjoyable. The main theme of the tune is, put simply, very good- a big, simple Sabbath riff- nothing you haven't heard before, but very effective and a riff worth repeating- while Lars smashes out a retardedly simple but very primal, really fitting drum beat. The way that the three riffs (count em!) flow together is again, simple, but effective and seamless. Musically, simple, sensible, solid. It's not an all time tune but it's still very good.\n\nVocally, though? Well, I think this a song where Reed actually compliments the tune. Keeps in rhythm, for one thing, utilises melody, gets a bit angry, keeps the ranting down- and contrasts well with the most aggressive Hetfield vocal since '88 or so. Yes, Hetfield does go \"I am the table\" a few times; it's pretty funny if you're still elementary school but a quick glance at the lyrics suggests that it makes sense within a very solid bunch off lyrics.\n\nSo all up? It's a weird track with some interesting vocal play, it's not a super long track, it's got a nice few riffs and is all round a pretty satisfying listen. Not much more to say, really. Give it a listen before you judge it eh.\n",
        "\nI can\u2019t say this is an easy work to give a rating to. It\u2019s practically alien altogether from anything else I\u2019ve ever reviewed. This is Metallica\u2019s latest polarizing work, in which they collaborated with 70s Velvet Underground man Lou Reed. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not entirely familiar with Lou\u2019s works as of right now but I won\u2019t let that affect my opinion of this\u2026which is quite complicated. This will be a long one, folks. Let\u2019s get started.\n\nLulu is the name given to this strange mutated piece of music, which stretches out for 90 minutes and contains music very much unlike anything Metallica has ever done before. The reason for that is because it was written by Lou Reed, with only minimal input from James, Lars and the boys in the structure and whatnot of the songs. Now, this album has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, and while I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad at all, I also don\u2019t want this to come off like some kind of apologetic rant \u2013 so let\u2019s get a few things on the table. This is very repetitive. It\u2019s long. It\u2019s dramatic, and it\u2019s a concept album based on German plays from the early 20th century. Lou Reed\u2019s voice sounds like a crazed, broken old drunk, and Metallica play rather fuzzed out, raw rock/metal grooves to compliment his raving.\n\nIt is that very rawness which attracts me to this from the beginning, because I guess I\u2019m a sucker for that stuff. This was recorded in 10 days, and because of that, not a lot of real polishing went into any of it. Thus, the music attains a real nice garage feel, a great, untamed and honest rawness that makes it sound natural and lifelike. There is a real theatrical quality to a lot of this, with Reed\u2019s muttering and hoarse intonations being restricted by the fact that he\u2019s a fossil, but also carrying this strange power to them anyway. I can\u2019t even describe it succinctly. It\u2019s like this whole murderous air that the lyrics have is carried perfectly by these vocals. Yes, he\u2019s decrepit, yes he sounds like a geriatric in an asylum, but it fits! I fully believe that Reed speaks the truth with these lyrics. No flashy showbiz, no tricks\u2026just the demented mind of some sicko poured out into 90 minutes of aural abyss.\n\nOK, so I should probably get into the story of the lyrics before I go any further\u2026basically from what I can tell, it\u2019s about a girl named Lulu who loved nothing except for seducing men and then breaking their hearts and crushing them into a fine powder \u2013 oh, and pain; she loves pain. When she meets Jack the Ripper, the two embark on a downward spiral of dejection, insanity and hatred. The lyrics are all laid out in stark naked glory, a dark beauty, and they are by far the best part of the album. They read sort of like mid-20th century beat poetry, which I guess fits, and Lou Reed was around back then. They\u2019re all very disturbing and dark. People make a fuss about the use of phrases in these lyrics that they take out of context and don\u2019t even bother to read the rest of, but really they\u2019re brilliant.\n\nThe actual music behind the vocals is, well, Metallica \u2013 albeit infused with a different mood and tone than usual; more depressive, more despairing. I have to say the first two songs aren\u2019t the strongest, and while \u201cBrandonburg Gate\u201d has some interesting melodies, it lacks a good climax. \u201cThe View\u201d is just a bit safe compared to the rest, which is all rather ambitious and sprawling. There are genuinely beautiful moments like the wistful sorrow of \u201cJunior Dad,\u201d or the broken-down \u201cLittle Dog,\u201d and there are moments of building tension and bloody unrest like the incredibly disturbing \u201cPumping Blood,\u201d or the channeled, senseless rage of \u201cDragon.\u201d \u201cMistress Dread,\u201d with its fast-riffs-slow-singing combination, comes off an extremely off-putting, eerie track that sets a tangibly macabre mood. \u201cIced Honey\u201d is perhaps the only song here that could stand on its own away from the conceptual ties, with its rollicking old school rock groove. The despairing, contemplative atmosphere of \u201cCheat on Me\u201d leads directly to the furious and wrathful \u201cFrustration,\u201d another one of the more forceful, disturbing songs on display.\n\nGenerally the formula with this album is the more intense a song gets, the better it gets \u2013 whether it be the angry side or the depressive, bleak side. This is at its fullest power when Metallica and Reed work together to envelop the listener in a pocket of rolling melodies and pounding rhythms. The repetition has been oft-cited as the worst aspect of Lulu and I guess I can see how; these songs are all quite long, but it really doesn\u2019t bother me much. It\u2019s actually done pretty well, and the songs never get boring once you get sucked into the atmosphere. Murderous and blood-soaked, yes, and sometimes cumbersome, but it never sounds like anything you\u2019ve heard before\u2026\n\nReally the failing of Lulu is that it is grossly inaccessible. This is a brilliantly atmospheric piece of music, with a great set-up and all, but it is unabashedly different from literally everything that most people want, unashamedly inaccessible and bullheaded to the point where it\u2019s too far gone to ever be a real masterwork. I applaud these guys for creating such a weird, whacked out piece of work, but they just let it all hang out, and while the roughness and the garage-band aesthetic appeals to me, I can\u2019t deny that they could have done more to trim it down a whole lot and make it a more efficient, economic piece.\n\nMost people hate Lulu for its aesthetic qualities like the repetitive songwriting and Reed\u2019s muttering, but really it doesn\u2019t work because it\u2019s just too clunky and fat. You need to hear the whole thing in order to get anything out of it; listening to just one song won\u2019t really do anything for you. And seeing that this thing is 90 friggin\u2019 minutes long, you better have time to really listen to it. Frankly, as intriguing as this can be, it\u2019s not really worth it. This is an artistic album, but it expects too much from the listener, and doesn\u2019t give enough in return.\n\nFor that it remains a curiosity and a singular, weird, fucked up experiment. Every once in a while I\u2019ll haul this out and give it a listen, when I\u2019m in the mood, but the truth is, I can\u2019t really defend Lulu. People will bash and rage about this all they want and frankly I can\u2019t really do much to dissuade them or prove them wrong. This isn\u2019t exactly good music. The atmosphere is interesting and the rawness is cool and I enjoy it for that, but as for actually saying it\u2019s good? Ehhh, I don\u2019t know about that. The lyrics are good, great even. But the music is flawed. Listen at your own peril.\n",
        "\nThe only question I could really pose to Metallica and Lou Reed would be: did you guys pull this out of your ass? This is, without a doubt, the worst album that Metallica has ever brought to their fans and I must say they have no excuse this time. It wasn't experimentation, nor was it because a bass player died or left the band, it's because they lacked ideas and just want money, that's it. This album, based off a German play on a whore, is an embarrassment to the fans and to the other bands in the Big Four, this is just sad. This album is just a huge heap of nothing that it's really hard to even come up with words to describe this album, I just don't know what to say. After listening to the album I was truly shocked to hear an album that was actually worse than St. Anger, they say it was impossible, but sure enough it occurred. Simply put, this is the worst I've heard since Morbid Angel's new release.\n\nThe music as a whole is just sloppy, so sloppy that it makes St. Anger and Death Magnetic musical masterpieces. Never have I heard an album so weak and dull in my entire life as a metal head, this is just one of those \"what the fuck\" moments. Perhaps I should elaborate a little on the music besides just bashing it. Lou Reed, who you'd expect to be a \"game changer\" for the band, sounds like he's free styling his lyrics as if he put no effort into making it sound good. Hetfield isn't doing so hot either, his vocals are worse than the last two albums. He sounds like a dying horse that's getting the crap kicked out of him, strained and below satisfactory. At first I thought Hetfield's vocals couldn't get any worse, but sure enough, it did. Ulrich's drumming has gone from bad to worse, it's like his St. Anger drumming but completely dull and wasted. Rob has been inaudible that it's like he's not even there, in the studio, playing and Kirk is playing along with him on his guitar as if he was a novice. Basically, Metallica has been playing in the background while Lou Reed is pretty much free style rapping like a nerd, and he sounds like one too. I mean, you'd expect a lot from Lou Reed, because it's Lou fucking Reed, but no you just hear a bunch of poorly structured lyrics.\n\nMoney is all that matters to Metallica now, you can tell by listening to this album. If they really care about the fans, then they'd make something worthwhile and productive. Seriously, if they actually want money then they should get back in touch with their 80s vibe and sound, maybe then they'd actually gain not only forgiveness from their fans, but satisfaction from them as well. You may think this is a complete \"anti-Metallica\" rant saying how much they \"suck\" or that they're \"sell outs\", if I said that on a \"Master of Puppets\" album review, that'd be acceptable. Here's the thing: reviews are about personal opinions that can sometimes lead to the truth. Right now: I am telling the truth because the album sounds like garbage, a waste of time, money and talent, there's nothing else to really say about it. Metallica, after releasing this atrocity, will never be the same again. This is St. Anger number three.\n\nIn conclusion, this album was a big disappointment to us all, we honestly wouldn't think that Metallica could sink this low, but hey, things can happen. I wouldn't recommend this album to anybody, if you should so happen to cross this album on your travels, turn the fuck around and run.\n",
        "\nLuck....Runs....Out....\n\nFor almost two decades, all was not well in the Metallica camp. I won't be kind to them, They produced some of the most mediocre, boring and unnecessarily overlong albums ever. Their only saving grace was the covers album they did. 'Garage Inc' showed some signs of life, but it wasn't even their material. Even their live performances were unconvincing, with Lars drumming like a one-handed handicap, Kirk screwing up his own solos left and right and James slowly losing his once great voice. \n\nBut enough of all that, I for one was pleasantly surprised when 'Death Magnetic' came out. The year was 2008, slowly but surely all the once great bands were showing clear signs of returning to playing fast metal again. Metallica's 9th album is not a thrash metal album, but a max of heavy, thrash, groove and rock. There are clear influences taken from Load and Reload, as well as their older stuff. Heck even the lyrics are very much in the vein of 'St. Anger' released in 2003. This could have been a really great album, and to some extent, it is, but it has it's problems.\n\nThe first song I heard was \"That Was Just Your Life\", and boy was I pleased. James Hetfield was once a mighty rhythm guitar player, but after '...And Justice For All', he's barely put his skills to good use. \"That Was Just Your Life\" is a pretty effective opener, just what they had to do kick things off, if only just for the nostalgia of hearing them play fast again. I wouldn't call it a thrash metal classic but the main riff is simplistic but aggressive and catchy, reminds me of their classic 'Battery'. The lyrics are a continuation of the themes from 'St. Anger', more or less. Hetfield's vocals are almost nothing like himself from the first five albums, but definitely the best he's sounded since the 80's. \n\n\"The End of the Line\" is a disappointment, especially considering this is the 2nd track. The second position is usually reserved for their best material (Just look at their classic albums). It sounds like a St. Anger outtake updated to fit in with the more 'metal' feel of this album. The lyrics are pretty bad as well. \"The End of the Line\" is a good example of a song that goes nowhere, it's bearable but not worth repeated listens. \"Broken, Beat and Scarred\" is similar, but has some surprisingly fast grooves. If Metallica had released an album between '...And Justice for All' and 'Metallica', this song would fit right in. Think 'Holier than Thou' from the Black album with the tighter playing of '...And Justice for All'. \n\n\"The Day That Never Comes\" came as no surprise, this song is basically a modern version of 'One'. The song has an extremely similar buildup. However, compared to 'One', this song is more overtly melodic and overall, less heavier, the lyrics are more sentimental. Despite the fact this is basically Metallica just re-imagining and re-writing their proven classics, \"The Day That Never Comes\" is pretty good, the first part of the song may drag a bit, but the second part has some memorable riffs and multiple melodic guitar solo spots, while not technically mind blowing, Kirk Hammett does redeem himself on this album, it's what you expect from him and what he does best. \n\n\"All Nightmare Long\" is a personal favorite, and is about as thrashy as this album gets. Even at nearly 8 minutes long, there's barely ever a dull moment. Riff after riff after riff, all mid-paced, rock-tinted thrash metal riffs and killer grooves. Brings back memories of \"Disposable Heroes\". The guitar solo is also pretty cool. I really dig the old-school flavor of some of the riffs, especially the really fast picking sections. The chorus and the pre-chorus parts are really long and infectious, and hard to forget, and even harder not to sing along. \"Cyanide\" is a misunderstood song, It sounds like a mess at first, but if grows on you with every listen. It's not a classic Metallica song, nor one of their best ever, but it has a few great moments and at least \"Cyanide\" sounds least like anything they've done before.\n\nYou'll either love or hate \"Unforgiven III\", I think it's surprisingly decent, even though it's a song that I don't feel like listening too often. \"The Judas Kiss\" is another one of the faster ones and has a pretty kick-ass set of riffs. Certain parts remind me of 'Master of Puppets', mostly the long-ass chorus part and the lyrics, Bow Down!, sell your soul to me!, sounds familiar? and other sections fit right in with the 8 minute long groove/thrashers of this album like \"All Nightmare Long\". \"Suicide And Redemption\" is sadly, a waste of time, It has a bunch of good riffs that could have been used in other songs with lyrics. Hetfield's guitar solo is also pretty good, but the bad parts overshadow the good ones. Not to mention, this is their most tedious and uninspiring instrumental song ever. \"My Apocalypse\" is like the 'Dyer's Eve' of this album, It's not one of my favorites as it just doesn't flow together that well. The mid-section has a solid old-school thrash riff that makes this song worth listening. \n\n\"Death Magnetic\" is certainly not an all time classic or even one of the better albums of it's decade. It's more like an inferior version of Metallica's first five classic albums. \"Magnetic\" is a really good effort, some songs are good, others aren't. The production is awful, If you're the kind who listens to music on headphones, well, this album may just hurt your ears, it's really that bad. A solid effort and a return to form, but, unfortunately other bands have 2 or 3 albums that are as good as this one. One more problem, every time I hear a song from this record, I just feel going back to their older, better albums.\n",
        "\n2011 hasn't been kind to a few high-profile bands and artists. The people involved with those projects (who shall go unnamed... okay, fine, Mike Portnoy, among many) should at least be happy they're not Lou Reed or Metallica, though. The collaboration no one was looking forward to, this debacle easily meets the low expectations everyone had about the album. But dear God, this is worse than any of us could have imagined. Metallica truly does not give a flying fuck anymore what they do, they're so goddamn sure it'll sell millions anyway. And what pisses me off is, it probably will, and Metallica will keep releasing half-assed shit like this. Yes, I understand this is a collaboration with famed singer-songwriter and former member of The Velvet Underground Lou Reed, but Metallica's name is still stapled on this product. To me, if this was truly something musically different, they would have come up with a different name entirely, but as it stands, it's a collaboration between Lou Reed and Metallica, so elements of both artists should be evident here. If this is the best Metallica can do, fuck them. Just fuck Metallica. \n\n(going on a bit of a tangent here) I never got what was so goddamn special about Metallica, anyway. Yeah, their first two albums (you heard me, TWO) were pretty damn good benchmarks of thrash metal, but it was all downhill from there-- over-commercialized hard rock garbage, and failed attempts at comebacks that fail to recapture their glory days, which Metallica doesn't seem to realize wouldn't have been possible without Dave Mustaine. This is the THIRD album since the infamously bad St Anger album, and Metallica still doesn't have its shit together. The drums are somehow worse, the guitars are almost non-existent, the bass even more so, and the song structures and lyrics are ungodly awful. \n\nYes, you heard me, the guitars are almost non-existent. All they do is buzz around in the background with nothing of noteworthiness or impact to be had from the \"riffs.\" If these are riffs, they're pathetic fucking riffs. The awful production does nothing to bring out the guitars or the bass. It's nothing but drums here, folks. Nothing but Lars Ulrich's horrendous drumming. Imagine the drumming from Death Magnetic (I know you don't want to, just work with me here), but with a zillion more cymbals. \n\nJames Hetfield takes a back seat on vocals and lets Lou Reed take the mic for most of the time. Baaaaaaad idea. Lou Reed sounds absolutely awful here. He's barely intelligible and horribly off-key. And that's just while he's singing! A lot of the time, he does this Ke$ha-like more-talking-than-singing that sounds even worse. When James does step in, it's almost a godsend, and considering how bad he sounded on Death Magnetic, that's a bad sign of what this sounds like. Honestly, if I could give this album a negative score, I could (and believe me, I tried).\n\nJesus, don't even get me started on how fucking long these songs are! I've been ragging on Junior Dad a lot, between my review of the single \"The View\" (which still sucks, by the way, but is sadly the best song on here) and just generally talking about this album, and I hate to keep doing that, but come on!!! It's 20 fucking minutes!!! The song lengths don't start off that bad on the first disc. The songs still suck horribly, but at least they're somewhat short. But then it gets to \"Cheat On Me,\" and it's somehow more downhill from there. There is nowhere NEAR enough musical ideas to warrant \"Cheat On Me\" being ELEVEN AND A HALF FUCKING MINUTES. But then again, this IS Metallica, who never quite know when long is too long, and on top of that, they're collaborating with Lou Reed, the man who did an entire album of guitar feedback. Time means absolutely nothing to these people. \n\nDisc 2 is worse. There are only four songs, the shortest being 8 minutes. There are literally moments in \"Frustration\" where the entire band drops dead silent, and Lou Reed is left to either ramble mindlessly and repetitiously over feedback or to signal Lars to do some of the worst drum fills in probably literally recorded history. Again, THERE IS NO WARRANTING THE SONGS BEING THIS LONG. If they trimmed off a lot of this fat, they could have crammed the album into one painful disc instead of two, saved a lot of plastic, and thus saved the earth a bit of the process. But nope. They don't give a shit. \"Little Dog\" goes absolutely NOWHERE (and the lyrics really suck on top of that), \"Dragon\" is just boring, and \"Junior Dad\" is abysmal (as expected). Most of \"Junior Dad\" is some bullshit \"spacey\" droning that was apparently something orchestrated by a... orchestra. There's no structure or emotion. It's just nonsensical \"atmosphere.\" Fuck that shit. Hell, if Metallica and Lou Reed released this album with just the first disc, I wouldn't be so compelled to try and give this a negative score. It'd still be a zero, but that's all it would be. MAYBE I'd be generous and give it a 1%. But that second disc really bogs down an already insufferable experience. \n\nThis is auditory torture. Pure shit. Nothing salvageable can be gained from this... thing's... existence. To use it as a coaster is an insult to coasters, and there are several, much more entertaining shit albums worthy of coaster-hood. Fuck, you could buy a coaster, put it in your CD player, and get more audible enjoyment out of that. Aside from James Hetfield repeatedly calling himself a table on \"The View,\" (fuck what the lyrics say, he is NOT saying 'tablet') you can't even make fun of this. This is just sad. Not only does it bring down one once-mighty name in the music community (Metallica), it brings down Lou Reed as well. Both of their careers are forever marred by this musical tragedy, and nothing can save them. Dave Mustaine could rejoin Metallica and re-record \"Kill 'Em All\", and it wouldn't help. I'm fucking done with Metallica. To me, they haven't done anything worthwhile since 1984 (save moments of ...And Justice For All), and they're sure as fuck never, ever going to release another Kill 'Em All or Ride the Lightning. Let's just face it, Metallica is over. St. Anger was the first giant misstep, Death Magnetic was the next one, and this is number three--- Three strikes, and you're out, motherfucker. Although, the two aforementioned abominations are sounding better and better each time I think about Lulu. Get Megadeth or Anthrax's new album this fall, and try and forget this artsy-fartsy, hipster-esque piece of shit, or anything else Metallica will ever release again, exists. \n\nShit, man, I wasn't even this mad with \"Master of Puppets...\"\n",
        "\nInnovation, experimentation, exploration, deviation, whatever the term may be, any craft seems to live and die by it in these modern times. The very notion of a grand new endeavor into untouched territory is at the forefront of everyone's mind. There must be something new, we can't be bothered with such things as consistency or any restraining framework to draw from, our integrity lives and dies by how much distance can be put between a new work and most anything else real or otherwise imaginable. For all the pretentiousness of this extended prelude to what will eventually become an actual point, my purpose is very simply to state that there is none, at least not where the subject of this session on the soapbox is concerned.\n\nAs an ardent skeptic of innovation for its own purpose, shock for its own sake, and all the other stupid excuses for creating revolting messes pretending to be art, it is my duty to be dismissive of such things as this latest abortion paraded out as the brainchild of Lou Reed and Metallica, a veritable collaboration made somewhere in the fecal swamps of the Malebolge. Being someone familiar with the concept of \"Lulu\" from my days as a student of 20th century Expressionist art and music at a respected college, including several classes analyzing the atonal opera penned by Alban Berg covering the same play series this fails at attempting to capture, I can attest to the abysmal nature of this failure of an album, and why even an adherent to the cult of dissonant, non-melodic, non-structured music of the German Avant-garde of which Berg belonged should dismiss it as a bad joke.\n\nBut enough with the nonsensical claims of artist relevance that this sloppy collection of sounds hopes to convey. To put it bluntly, this album is pain inducing, not only for the utter randomness it revels in, but because of a very poor presentation from all parties involved. Lou Reed has never been a particular favorite of mine, but his aimless semi-spoken, out of tune ramblings are difficult to stomach, let alone pretend to be amused by. Hetfield's vocals are half-assed and wanting in the same respect that they were on \"Death Magnetic\", and the riffs presented here are derivative cliches from various eras of Metallica repeated ad nauseam or intermingled with unstructured, directionless non-metal music. The mercifully short opener \"Brandenburg Gate\" is a perfect display of this, throwing out a rhythmically inconsistent acoustic guitar line right out of a 70s ballad before entering a bizarrely happy down tempo rock groove while Reed rambles about cutting off his legs and tits because of all the early 20th century pop culture references I suppose.\n\nAs the album unfolds, so too does the confuted musical ideas and overt lyrical dadaism. Some of the least offensive and more sleep inducing elements of this unfortunate mistake are to be found within the first half of this double album, containing songs that go from moderately to overtly overlong, and revoltingly bad ideas repeated to death. \"The View\" touts a small collection of doom based rock riffs, \"Pumping Blood\" attempts to thrash things up with a few cliche riffs and a lot of feedback noise, but no matter which direction things go, an inescapable awkwardness lingers between Lou Reed's idiotic ramblings and the lack of any real stylistic or rhythmic cohesion. Lars' drumming is poorly accomplished, especially with regards to the shoddy, over-processed production job that swallows up his kit. The bass is an out and out non-factor, and Hammett's solos range from uninteresting window-dressing to a logical extension of the painful frustration exuded in the rest of the instrumentation.\n\nFor all the terrible things going on during the first half of this disaster, however, the true ugliness of this incipient misconception rears its head in the second. All that can be said about this outlandish niche that has been established is that the longer it goes, the worse it gets. Between the excruciating repetition of \"Dragon\" and the stagnated ambiance that dominated that latter half of the near 20 minute crap-shoot \"Junior Dad\", this album just can't seem to cope with the idea that someone is actually supposed to be deriving enjoyment from listening to it. While the first half of this album seems uninterested in the emotional state of its audience, the remaining half is consciously trying to affect it in the most negative way possible.\n\nThe ultimate end of any art form is not necessarily a compromise between the capricious demands of any audience and those of the creator, but it is a forgone conclusion that anything hoping to be relevant should at least try to be accessible. But \"Lulu\" seems to have its own sense of irony in that the audience it has chosen is one of a masochistic nature, indeed, one that would figuratively cut off their own legs and tits before seeing a Metallica release that didn't become a part of their collection. My own desire to walk and manipulate the gas pedal in my car prevents me from the former, while my lack of enthusiasm for the transgender craze of the post-sexual revolution period rules out the latter. If you value your legs and your tits, if you desire James Hetfield to aspire to better things than being a flat, four-legged surface where food consumption takes place, and if you put metal before the religious psychosis of pointless innovation, do not reward this with monetary transactions and mock it whenever possible.\n",
        "\nWhen Metallica released their self-titled \u201991 album, they were propelled into the realms of super stardom. No longer were they a fairly successful metal band making ends meet by touring. Now they were a moneymaking metal machine. A band that were selling squillions of albums and making a fuck load of money in the process. \n\nNow with fame and money comes change. Everything changed for them. Their lifestyle, their principles, their taste, and most defiantly, their taste in music. I can appreciate that the members of the band have grown up and would have had different tastes in music. Country, blues, indie (Lars, you dick!), but normally when it came to Metallica, everybody put their individual tastes aside, put their metal caps on, and got down to work. Even the \u201cBlack\u201d album, while very commercial (for Metallica, anyways), still contained some of the band\u2019s heaviest work. Sad But True, Holier Than Thou, Of Wolf And Man to name just a few, but when Load was released it was just a step too far for some in the rock/alternative direction for the metal giants. \n\nMost of the songs on the album are good in their own right, it\u2019s just that some of them are blatantly not cut from the \u2018Tallica cloth. Until It Sleeps and Hero Of The Day sound too clean and poppy to even be on this album to begin with and probably would have sounded better on an Alanis Morissette album or something else of that ilk. Ronnie, while I do like this song, just sounds massively out of place. The song, I believe, would have benefited more as a b-side or bonus track on CoC\u2019s Deliverance. County, rock, and blues seem to have taken precedence on this album more so than metal. You wouldn\u2019t think it given the name of the band, y\u2019know, \u2018METAL\u2019lica.\n\nNow, I know a lot of people (myself included) started bitching and moaning that Bob Rock changed Metallica, but in all honesty both the band and Bob Rock were equally as guilty for change in musical direction and even though Bob Rock may have been the catalyst that started Metallica down the more commercial road, he had given the band a new thickness and broadness to their sound and made them, sonically, a better sounding band. \n\nOK! Enough picking at the album. Let's now focus on the good stuff. The album kicks off with Ain\u2019t My Bitch, an awesome rocker that deceivingly makes the listener think that although this isn\u2019t a return to Metallica\u2019s thrash metal greatest, this album is going to rock from start to finish. \nNow this album does rock in sporadic burst with Metallica branching out into areas unknown and new only to come crashing back down to Earth with random shit songs (Cure, Poor Twisted Me, I\u2019m looking in your direction). 2x4 is a heavy, groove-laden number that is the first song on the album where you realize that this isn\u2019t Metallica of yore, but something different/new. \n\nIf the track listing had been trimmed down by about 5 songs, the album may have been accepted a little more because some of these songs blatantly don\u2019t belong on this album. Here\u2019s what I thought the track listing should have been: \n\n1: Ain\u2019t My Bitch \n2: 2x4\n3: The House That Jack Built \n4: Bleeding Me\n5: King Nothing\n6: Thorn Within \n7: Wasting My Hate\n8: Mama Said \n9: The Outlaw Torn \n\nBleeding Me and The Outlaw Torn are by far the best songs on the album. Both songs are kinda reminiscent of each other and both are over 8 minutes long. They tend to have a mellow or melodic intro with quiet verses, heavy choruses, and long sections of basic, bluesy instrumentation in the middle and at the end of the song. Both songs sound very epic without having to try to hard. There aren't numerous different sections \u00e0 la Master Of Puppets to make the songs longer. They are just... long, yet they don\u2019t feel it. \n\nPerformance-wise, the band doesn\u2019t slack off too much. Hetfield\u2019s voice sounds as strong as ever. Firmly established by years of drinking and touring is the patented \u201cHell Yeah!\u201d approach Hetfield has taken with his vocals and it fits the band and, in particular, this album perfectly. \n\nLars had taken a very stripped-down approach to his playing for this album. I can\u2019t recall any double bass on this album. It\u2019s like he turned into a completely different drummer. I mean, I know that Lars was or would never be classed as the best drummer in metal, but he is full of energy when playing live and is a master of covering up his mistakes during songs, but the actual playing on the drums just sounds lifeless with only a slight groove or injection of anything that would be deciphered as passion for playing music. The sound of the drums, however, is immense. The only redeeming feature for the drums on this album is that they sound hellish, very heavy, and pounding. Thud-to-the-chest sorta good. \n\nNow to me this album seems to be the antithesis to ...And Justice For All because the bass can actually be heard and plays a main role in the music with tons of low-end giving the band a slightly heavier edge. Adding to that, the band have decided to tune down to Eb for this album and it sounds all the heavier for it. \n\nNow we get the meat of Metallica: the guitars. Hetfield and Hammett have achieved an awesome guitar tone for this album. In my opinion, it\u2019s the best guitar tone they\u2019ve ever achieved. I\u2019ve got nothing against the whole \u201csweep-the-mids\u201d sound, but it gets a bit monotonous when every single metal band is doing it, but for this album they have dropped that tone and went for something with a little more chunk and bite. The riffs range from good, heavy, chunky riffs to alternative pieces of wank. I don\u2019t know what the band was thinking with some of the riffs they decided to throw in. Some of them just don\u2019t even sound remotely like Metallica where others, although different, sound like a natural progression from what the band started on the Black album. \n\nAll in all, this is a very hit or miss album. It has some very good songs, but also has some of Metallica\u2019s worst. The band were neck deep into experimenting when they recorded this album. Some may say the experiment worked, some may say it exploded in their faces. I\u2019m of both worlds. While I do think the album exploded in their collective faces yet not enough to damage their careers (in fact, it did the opposite. Ka-Ching! $) and they were able to recover with some fine musical plastic surgery (i.e. Death Magnetic). Even though I have had a bit of a negative rant about this album, I do put this album on occasionally and do enjoy it. I enjoy it even more when I make a playlist of my version of the track list, but that\u2019s by the by. \n\nSo if you\u2019re a Metallica fanboy, you\u2019re probably gonna eat this up. If you\u2019re a Bay Area purist, you\u2019re probably gonna hate it. If you\u2019re open-minded and a fan of music in general, I recommend giving this album a spin. It\u2019s not their best, it's certainly not their worst, but it\u2019s definitely worth a listen. Go on. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? <- Awaiting law suit for last quote.\n",
        "\nSo to begin with, my reasons for listening to this \u2018album\u2019 are out of the scope of this review, so I must begin without stating them. So Metallica now thankfully get hold of a new idea with vocalist Lou Reed for a sort of concept album. Now taking into consideration the fact that Metallica lyrics were always hard to decipher because they seldom carried any meaning, the concept album thing is little hard to imagine. But if it is your hope that Lou Reed might bring about some creative spark within the dumb brains of Ulrich and Co., then you are utterly mistaken. \n\nOn a technical level, Lou Reed is terrible and will make James Hetfield look like Hansi Kursch. The guitar work is terrible. Do not try to find some riffs anywhere in the album, Metallica forgot how to properly write them by 1992 and totally by 2001. So you cannot expect them to come out suddenly with a Time Does Not Heal which shoves riff after riff down your throats. Kirk Hammett is well to do in his department and somewhere and sometimes within the dry dessert of musical void, you find a decent lead or too to cheer about. Ulrich\u2019s can bashing worsens from his death magnetic days and has no proper rhythm or beats. He does not know about decent fills, so forget about them. The production thankfully is decent compared to the band\u2019s last two outings and the rhythm guitar has a decent sound to it.\n\nSo we begin with an age old Metallica ritual of beginning the album with a horrendous acoustic riff. It appears as if Reed was forced to drink a bottle of anti-biotic eye drops before \u2018singing\u2019, so bad does he sound. \u201cI would cut my legs and tits off\u201d, well may I help you with it? There is a sort of duet between Reed and Hetfield, with Hetfield bellowing \u201csmall town girl\u201d over and over and Reed reading the day\u2019s news report. The upcoming, The View is even more terrible with Reed\u2019s news report getting more and more sleep inducing. The song is mid-paced and the riffs are so poor that will make Enter Sandman look like Coma Of Souls. Pumping Blood has Reed totally speaking, he might well be reading step by step instructions to keep ants off your food when you go for a picnic, or how to protect and defend yourself if you are being ass raped. The song picks up pace after a while and I imagine Ulrich being paralyzed for a couple of weeks for thrashing his cans at that pace. Mistress Dead and Iced Honey are more of the same. Cheat On Me begins slowly and atmospherically, where we actually begin to think that the album would pick up. This is then followed by Reed\u2019s \u201cwhy do I cheat on me\u201d; you are a brainless retard that is why. The song plods on for eleven minutes with Reed and Hetfield barking \u201cwhy do I cheat\u201d, over and over and the little troll Ulrich bashing up his cans.\n\nThe next disk begins with Frustration, yes that is what we are exactly feeling, for buying the disk. These guys would have made decent psychologists for reading other people\u2019s minds so accurately and naming their songs with the same. The opening riff is decent and might actually be the best off the album. But the rest of the song sucks as much as the others. I won\u2019t go on to give beautiful adjectives for the lyrics as I am afraid to be kicked out of here for indecency of language. Dragon offers a much needed change of pace and is quite memorable due to that. Kirk accomplishes a small distorted lead somewhere in all the news reports. The final song is twenty minutes of useless political speeches and can thrashing of which not even a single minute could be remembered. Come on guys, write a song that can remain interesting for two minutes, and then think of writing twenty minute ones. \n\nThis infernal piece of abomination is even worse than St.Anger, Blackwater Park, Unarmed, Risk; you name your worst album, and this will suck far more than that. Where Hetfield was at least tolerable, Reed is not even that. Regardless of what is said and done, he does not sing anywhere in the album. He just blurts out some random line trying hard to catch a tune, but helplessly just cannot. The vocals are even more grating than the BBC weather reporter or my third grade history teacher so infernally bland, tasteless and boring are they. The pace barely moves above the Enter Sandman mid-pace and with so hideous riffs and songs you sure as death would be wanting to go and bash up Ulrich and Co. Above all, this piece of can thrashing and news reports, which this band had decided to call music, is more than eighty minutes long. So after reading all this, the question of buying this must not arise. But if it has, then I might suggest you to switch on BBC news, and watch the weather report of the day. I will say that it has more musical ideas in it than this abominable piece of shit.\n",
        "\nSometimes, an album ends up dropping into your lap that isn\u2019t a necessary listen. Or a recommended release. Or even a guilty pleasure. An album just so OUT THERE that, despite its iffy nature, you just can\u2019t ignore it. That\u2019s exactly what I felt when I learned about Metallica and Lou Reed coming together to record an album. I mean, seriously\u2026Metallica and LOU REED??? Now, for the record, I\u2019m all for different genre collaborations, but there was just something about the two of them throwing songs down that just was a little TOO oblong for its own good. And too oblong to not take notice.\n\nSo, let\u2019s find out just how it all went down\u2026\n\nIf there was EVER an album that would redefine \u201cmismatch\u201d, THIS should be at the top of the list. Other words come to mind when it comes to \u201cLulu\u201d. Bizarre. Lifeless. Soulless. But in the end, the two that best describe it would have to be \u201ctrain wreck pile-up\u201d. By all the gods of death, this is one of the most confusing, slapdash albums I\u2019ve had the misfortune of giving a listen to. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s BAD (it is, trust me), it also seems so completely unsure of itself, like a multi-track stylistic tug-of-war ending in a penultimate stalemate. Is it metal? Is it rock? Is it country? ALL OF THE ABOVE?? NONE??? I just don\u2019t fucking know! But what I DO know is that it\u2019s so bad that you can\u2019t even laugh at. I\u2019d overheard from a little birdie named Dov that this makes \u201cSt. Anger sound like Sgt. Peppers\u201d, and you know what? That little birdie is on to something, as \u201cLulu\u201d, on a creative aspect, is a disgrace of retardation-inducing proportions. Bear in mind, though, that I\u2019m looking at this as objectively and abstractly as possible, trying to find any redeeming qualities no matter how skimpy or rare, but after repeated bouts of exposure I\u2019ve yet to find ANY.\n\n\u201cLulu\u201d isn\u2019t on par with the most vapid side of Lordi. It\u2019s not even on the same level as mid-to-late era Ozzy. Hell, this is a HAIR\u2019S-WIDTH away from being on the same spectrum as the worst of post-Tarja Nightwish! And SO MANY ASPECTS of this album are at fault; the watered-down, repetitive semi-thrash riffs, the lack of at least good enough solos, the mid-pacing that doesn\u2019t get any better the more its hammered into the ground, and, worst of all, Mr. Reed\u2019s stroke-addled-like slurring and mistimed warbling that is hardly on key or on time with the rest of the music. It\u2019s almost like Metallica wrote a bunch of half-baked riffs, recorded a simple demo of them being played OVER and OVER and OVER again, and had Lou come up with an even more demo-quality amount of singing the same few lines OVER and OVER and OVER again, ending with a numbing of the mind and ear drums for would-be listeners. It would have been one thing if this was done for personal shits and giggles, but the fact that this has been released as a PROFESSIONAL album just makes the circumstances all the more bothersome and disorienting thanks to tracks like \u201cBrandenburg Gate\u201d, \u201cPumping Blood\u201c and \u201cIced Honey\u201d.\n\nIn the end I find no real reason to listen to this, or for it to exist. I wouldn\u2019t consider this even a curio for the most militant of Metallica fans, let alone anyone interested in musicians from different walks of life throwing an album together. Avoid\u2026AVOID!\n\nOriginally written for The Offering\nwww.offeringwebzine.com\n",
        "\nThis album will beat all the scores on any metal portal. This collaboration record between the old and tired experimental rock singer Lou Reed and the aged thrash metal legend Metallica will probably get the lowest average rating ever by the fans. My rating score will probably be amongst the most favourable reviews because I try to analyze this output from an objective and not an emotional point of view. I may accord a score of twenty-five to this album but emotionally, this is not even worth half of this score indeed. Let's take a look on what happened.\n\nLou Reed and Metallica decided to work together after having played together live at the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame 25th anniversary show. Lou Reed had been working on a conception album featuring passages inspired by the controversial German playwright Frank Wedekind. Lulu tells the story of a desperate and disillusioned woman that is only a shadow of her past and lives a fatal emotionless circle of sex, abuse and despair. The emotionless spoken word vocals by Lou Reed, the minimalist instruments, the experimental style of this album and the cold and simple album cover underline the concept. Let\u2019s note that this album doesn\u2019t feature much of James Hetfield\u2019s vocals and only a few lost thrash riffs. This album is eighty percent Lou Reed and maybe twenty percent Metallica and this estimation is eventually even quite optimistic. \n\nSo far, so good but the music itself is even harder to digest as the story itself. The two artists created a lot of overlong tracks with a lack of variation, emotion and diversity. This is no accident but an effect they really wanted to create to bring the story to life and give an authentic and unique twist to this experimental collaboration. The final result included though too many emotionless overlong passages that may even bore the most open-minded and intellectual music fan in the world to death. After two or three minutes, everything is said but the songs are stretched at least three times too much with a peak of almost twenty minutes of dumb and hypnotizing boredom in the final \"Junior Dad\". Metallica sad that the section of classic music in the second half of the track made them cry and really touched them but I never heard such a boring and closed minded piece of classic music. There are a few additional musicians that play viola, cello, violin and electronic instruments but everything sounds as one big indefinable potpourri. Don't even think about symphonic metal bands such as Therion, Apocalyptica or even Savatage if you read about those guest musicians who know how to mix metal music with classic passages. Even Metallica's controversial \"S&M\" experiment which I actually liked was way more convincing than this failure.\n\nAlmost all songs are overlong, boring and dumb but I really must point out the track \"Little Dog\". This is by far the worst metal song I have ever listened to in my life. Well, I would not even call this music. It has a more than minimalist and exchangeable instrumental work while Lou Reed uses a completely emotionless and blurry murmured voice to put some almost random spoken word passages over the music for eight long minutes. He has no charisma, no variation and no energy. This can't even be defended by the fact that the band wanted to bring a desperate and emotionless character to life. Music, vocals and lyrics just don't fit together. If you are at this kind of emotional degree, you are already more than suicidal. Even a dog would moan and run away by listening to this incredible piece of garbage and try to commit suicide by biting his own tail off until there is no blood left to be shed. This song is an open insult to psychedelic rock, Krautrock and any progressive Stoner metal as any amateur band of any of these kinds is better and more authentic than what Lou Reed and Metallica deliver with this anti-effort. This sounds like Johnny Cash on a heavy dose of cannabis just before his death. I declare this the worst metal song ever.\n\nCompared to this disasterpiece even the really bad tracks on this overlong double-album merit a few low percentage ratings and vary between horrible and pretty bad. The longer the tracks are, the worse they get. Many critics laughed about the weird \"The View\" with its strange and ridiculous lyrics but this track turns out to be the most dynamicle and diversified track on the album which is only beaten by the solid opener \"Brandenburg Gate\" which is simply too short to get redundant even if the chorus is already repeated way too much. I want to underline that we talk about acceptable to mediocre songs and not about good efforts but next to the eight disasterpieces that follow these songs sound like a relief. Anybody that bashed \"The View\" will be stunned by the high degree of failure of the rest of the record if he or she is tough enough to make it entirely through this record. Sometimes, you can skip five minutes within the song and everything still sounds the same. Let me give you an advice: Don't waste your time and money on that. Don't buy this because you have all the other Metallica records. Don't expect this to grow on you. It will probably even get worse the more youi listen to this. If you didn't like \"The View\", you'll hate the rest even more. If you liked \"The View\", chances are elevated you may nevertheless hate the rest. This is the kind of record one person among ten thousand will like but I'm not into this at all.\n\nIn the end, the acceptable two first tracks, the story and the at least interesting concept itself and the acceptable sound of the record add a few points to a very bad final rating. I always defended Metallica and I liked all of their experimental works in the past. I'm one of those who adored \"Load\" and especially \"ReLoad\" quite a lot and who was able to accept the \"St. Anger\" record which really grew on me over the years and happens to be among my favourite Metallica albums. \"Lulu\" just won't grow. There is no diversity. There is no energy. There is no authenticity. Even harsh critics must admit that the controversial \"St. Anger\" is a masterpiece compared to this, anybody else is really out of his mind. The release date of this garbage is a hard day for the heavy metal universe. But let's see this from a positive point of view. No matter what Metallica will record in the beginning of the next year, the band's upcoming solo record can definitely only be an improvement. But they surely lost a lot of fans with \"Lulu\" who won't give them any new chance and I can really understand this. What did Metallica think by doing this? I really think they do whatever they want and don\u2019t give a damn about anything else. That\u2019s artistically interesting but commercially suicidal. There is no excuse this time.\n",
        "\n\u201cKill Em\u2019 All\u201d, just maybe the most influential thrash metal album of all time? Well some would agree, some would disagree. I think we can all agree that this album is one the most important thrash metal albums of all time. Introducing the masses to this new thing called thrash metal with some help from Overkill and Exodus, but demos aside, Metallica, for me at least, takes the glory when it comes to first full length thrash album ever. \n\n\u201cHit the Lights\u201d is a great opener, cymbal and guitar nonsense, a really simple but awesome riff, lots of speed and about 15 different solos equals an amazing song. \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d once again has some pretty simple riffs but wow this song is good. Kind of NWOBHM sounding. This album has the most thrash ever put on a Metallica album. \u201cHit the Lights\u201d, \u201cMotorbreath\u201d, \u201cWhiplash\u201d, \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d, \u201cMetal Militia\u201d, and \u201cNo Remorse\u201d all have some insane speed in them. \u201cNo Remorse\u201d probably has my favorite thrash part of all time. You\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about. \u201cJump in the Fire\u201d is another slower song that has some of James\u2019 best vocals. \u201cMotorbreath\u201d has an awesome drum intro and has some very punk influenced riffs and is full speed ahead the whole song. \u201cAnesthesia\u201d Pulling Teeth\u201d is just a bass solo. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Cliff is my idol, but I just don\u2019t see the point. As far as bass solos go, it\u2019s an amazing solo but I don\u2019t really wanna listen to a bass solo. \u201cMetal Militia\u201d is definitely the fastest song on here. This song should be the thrash metal anthem. \n\nProduction on here is awesome. Raw, aggressive, thrash metal sound. Those crunchy guitars made famous from this album sound amazing. The drums sound really good. The bass is audible the whole time and the bass sounds really good. Kirk pulls off some awesome solos, and there are a lot of them on here. \n\nThis is easily my favorite Metallica album for two reasons. The music of course and this is the album that I fell that the members were most passionate about music. This is when I\u2019m sure none of them expected to go huge and way before money ever touched them. James\u2019 vocals are on a completely different level on this album. Lars played with the most feeling on here and he did a really good job. Simple? Yes, but amazing? Also, yes. I guess I can\u2019t finish this review without thanking Dave Mustaine for being a co-writer in a few songs. I\u2019m glad they kicked him out though, because now I get to listen to Metallica and Megadeth! \n\nOverall, an amazing album. The first full length thrash metal album and it kills. Buy this right now if you don\u2019t already own it. \n\nBest tracks \u2013 \u201cMetal Militia\u201d, \u201cMotorbreath\u201d, and \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d\n",

        "\nThe infamous reputation this song has obtained through the turbulent era that it came out of in Metallica\u2019s history and its connection to the Napster scandal and the natural accusations of corporate greed a la Lars Ulrich\u2019s gratuitous campaigning in response is unavoidable in any conversation about it. Those who had either a positive or negative reaction to their shift in musical direction in the 90s became a side issue, and with it were lost things of much more importance, chief among them being the actual music. It is with a good 10 years plus of distance from the public debate on Lars\u2019 sincerity as a musician of that time period that I endeavor to showcase a valid reason for hating this song, rather than just lumping it in with the rest of Metallica\u2019s post-thrash musical failures in the usual arbitrary fashion.\n\nTo keep things in perspective, those who associate \u201cI Disappear\u201d, the famed featured song on the lackluster sequel to Tom Cruise\u2019s \u201cMission Impossible\u201d, with the commercial boons that were the \u201cLoad\u201d albums are only partly off base. This is revealed, ironically enough, when parsing the instrumental b-side that removes James\u2019 over-processed vocal tracks. What emerges is a variation on the loose, sloppy, dumbed down guitar style that typified \u201cLoad\u201d, but featuring Lars moving dangerously close to that trashcan sound that came up on \u201cSt. Anger\u201d. It\u2019s buried under a slightly thicker guitar tone and an obnoxiously pervasive wah pedal counter-theme coming out of Hammett and it has a small helping of reverb to give it some extra depth, but minus the vocals, it can be heard in all its popping, tinny glory.\n\nThe drums are not the only disaster to behold on the instrumental side of things, and they wouldn\u2019t really be noteworthy except for how they foreshadowed future decline. The real offender here is the utter banality of the entire song, plodding through a redundant set of rock grooves and a sloppy atmospheric interlude with the usual clean tone nods to U2. Topping it all off is a comical lead guitar break out of Kirk Hammett that sounds like a reject from Jimi Hendrix\u2019s lost recording sessions; fodder for the idiots who believe everything they read in Rolling Stone, but first slightly humorous then awkwardly annoying to anyone who looks to a guitar solo as a point of contrast or climax. And leave us not forget the clashing low tone of the solo in comparison to the slightly less bass-steeped rhythm guitar tracks, leaving the drums to play the top end (again, hinting at what occurred on \u201cSt. Anger\u201d).\n\nSo the question becomes, why is this poorly written, poorly performed pile of rehashed hard rock still hailed as a commercial breakthrough? The answer is quite simply, most people who hear this song never get beyond the vocals. Sure, there are a couple of brief breaks from James\u2019 semi-gritty performance, but this song is specifically tailored so that the listener hears the music, but isn\u2019t really listening to it. Furthermore, the seeming inability of most to disassociate the song from the post, special effects steeped music video probably further feeds the illusion that this is an intelligent, well crafted rock tune. In many respects, this song lives up to the motion picture that it is associated with, all visual and virtually no depth to speak of.\n\nNow putting aside the objective properties of this song for the final verdict, while most are dumbfounded at just how much of an industry whore Lars is, I\u2019m dumbfounded as to why the fuck anyone would download this song for free, let alone pay money for it. It is not merely a bad listen with a confuted intent (aka \u201cSt. Anger\u201d). it is a blatant exercise in musical dishonesty that is actually more common amongst mainstream MTV oriented rock music than most would like to admit. They say that video killed the radio star, but truth be told, video has largely killed any interest in dynamic and intricate music. While not every song that transfers into the video medium ends up losing its inherent value (see the video for \u201cOne\u201d and \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d), ones like this that are basically written for the video medium never really have any to begin with.\n",
        "\nMetallica had made a new album with the incredible Lou Reed with the title \"Lulu\" and I looked at the cover and thought: \"oh god here we go, St. Anger number three\". Being optimistic, I tried not to judge the album by it's cover and I decided to dig deeper and find a preview of this album, suddenly news on the internet went around about a preview song known as \"The View\". Like every other fan out there who was starting to lack faith in the band, I gave the song a listen, in hopes of hearing something good because they have Lou Reed in their line-up and that Metallica had the chance of bringing back their thrash vibe and sound. I just wasted five minutes and seventeen seconds of my life and I'll never get that back. Is this single really that bad? I'll tell you something: yes it is! This song practically makes St. Anger & Death Magnetic musical masterpieces. \n\nThe song is played out like this:\n\nIt starts off with some really bad drum filler played by the infamous Lars Ulrich and then the instruments start coming in, despite that the riffs sound okay it doesn't help. Lou Reed is talking through some lyrics that sound like they've been pulled out of his ass, and as he's \"talking\" them out, Metallica is jamming in the background carelessly. The song goes on like this for a while and tends to repeat a little until the outro comes in with James Hetfield yelling out \"I'M THE TABLE\" over and over again. Yes, you heard me, that's it. No words can describe it further.\n\nI thought St. Anger was the worst album they have ever produced, I guess I was wrong. This song really does give us \"The View\" on the upcoming album. To a whopping percentage of 99.9% of (former) Metallica fans, the game (meaning Metallica's future) is over. What the hell were they thinking? Personally, it could be the fact that they have no material or ideas left in their heads and just want to make money, because let's be honest, what else could they do for a living? Don't think this is an \"Anti-Metallica\" fan rant, it's not. I'm telling the absolute truth when I say: \"don't buy this album!\" because it's going to be a waste of money and your time. So if James wants to be the table, then I get to be the fan that's royally pissed off and disappointed! Metallica was my first metal band when I was 12, I own their first four albums and they were great even now. It just kills me that the band I spent a majority of my teen years listening to has finally broken apart into tiny pieces and I'm pretty sure it can't be fixed. All in all, this single wasn't great at all, it didn't make the cut. They weren't even there. My only advice to the fans, who still want to listen to this album/single, bring a gun and some earplugs.\n",
        "\nThere comes a time when someone possessed of even the slightest sliver of common sense has to put his foot down and say that the case for innovation has its limits. While it is very true that without innovation any art form will wither and die, the same case could be argued for everything needing water, yet if you immerse anything not possessed of gills or a structure otherwise conducive to filter oxygen from H20 in nothing but it, the object will drown. This is the dilemma that many bored metal bands seem to be suffering from of late, with Metallica being among the chief offenders, wandering from one bizarre project to the next with no accounting for consistency in any respect. While most might be taken aback of even shocked by what appears to be the first representation of a certain flop of a collaboration with Lou Reed, I\u2019m not, and I\u2019d venture to argue that my assessment and that of every other detractor of their output since the mid-90s should function as a big \u201cI told you so\u201d to anyone who expected a good product here.\n\nThe most common defense of this song is that it isn\u2019t an official Metallica project, and should thus be treated differently. I will be charitable and assume this to be the case, despite the fact that the Metallica brand name is included on this album and not one or two, but all 4 members in congress are functioning in a full time musical capacity. At best, what is heard on here can be summed up as a really redundant, sloppy, 3 riff traditional doom song with a fair infusion of hard rock. While nothing on this song can be qualified as redeemable, particular note should be taken of Lars\u2019 drumming, exuding a banality to it that is frightening. There\u2019s no fills, no turn around, no transitions to speak of, just an awkward straight beat that switches between down tempo and middle of the road. The riff set is a droning knockoff of a number of stoner riffs I\u2019ve heard somewhere, playing up the pentatonic sensibilities and murky tone of Iommi circa 1971, yet failing to add any detailing apart from two noise-driven lead breaks out of Hammett that sound like a catatonic failed attempt at emulating Dave Chandler.\n\nThe many problems this song suffers from don\u2019t end with a poor performance out of Metallica, and I\u2019d argue that they are the lesser offenders here. The real annoyance is the middle ground between speaking and singing (the Germans call this Singspiel, and it was utilized in a modern atonal opera of the same name as this single\u2019s full length album in the 1930s by Anton Berg with far superior results) that Lou Reed is utilizing during his vocal sections. Not only does it completely clash with what little is going on here musically, it is utterly flat and dead, almost as if a recently reanimated zombie from \u201cThe Last Man On Earth\u201d is dictating the lyrics. James Hetfield chimes in occasionally during the slightly faster sections, sounding his usual half-assed self, as has been the case since \u201cLoad\u201d. To chalk the production of this monstrosity up, picture the deadened drum sound of \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d and cross it with the hollow, limp guitar sound of \u201cReload\u201d, and take away any semblance of energy that any of the songs on those albums still managed to have.\n\nGood people of the world should mind the risks of getting drunk on one\u2019s own ego after being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, because this is quite a telling case of checking one\u2019s brain at the door. I literally got more enjoyment suffering through the catastrophe that was \u201cSt. Anger\u201d that this song, and given the ridiculously long time lengths advertized on \u201cLulu\u201d, I wonder if I will be able to survive an hour and a half of this brand of punishment. I wouldn\u2019t say buy the upcoming album because of the likely accusations of human rights violations that would follow, but for those who like it long and painful, waiting a few weeks after the release will probably see some people either giving it away, or asking for a currency number that jingles. Somewhere in a bar or couple of bars in America, both Jason Newstead and Dave Mustaine are laughing their asses off right now.\n",
        "\nAny reviewer can wax poetic on and on about how Metallica became the biggest joke that thrash metal has ever seen. I'm not going to beat a dead horse. I'm here to review what is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of Metallica's talents.\n\nThis demo is unique in that it features Ron on the bass and Dave on lead guitars. Other than that, there's very little difference between these songs and the songs that would appear on Kill 'em All, at least in the musical aspect. The songs are shorter overall, not quite as fast, and there are some lyrical differences. However, this demo showcases the aggression that Metallica seems to have lost in later years.\n\nThe songs show a heavy NWOBHM influence. Dave's solos are pretty much replicas of what Kirk plays on KEA, which lends credence to the idea that Kirk cannot write an original catchy lick to save his life. James' vocals are untested and youthful, with a few voice cracks here and there. I thought that Dave was singing on Hit the Lights -- the vocals do not have any of the James trademarks. Also note the bass shredding during the opening wave of Hit the Lights -- that ain't Cilff, that's Ron. Actually, the bass is a bit more prominent on this than on KEA, probably due to the lower fidelity of the recording. Lars' drumming is not flashy, which it doesn't need to be, and works well with the songs. Lars may not be the most technically proficient drummer in metal, but he can keep a beat well (at least until the opening riff of Blackened).\n\nFans of KEA will probably miss the slower section of The Four Horsemen (here denoted as Mechanix, and redone in a much more slaughtering version by Dave's later group Megadeth) and the extended outros and solos. But for a demo, you don't need all the fluff. You need to get your song down, and deal with the extraneous crap on the album.\n\nEssentially, this is a reminder of what was and what could have been for Metallica. From unwashed raw metal to over-produced cash grabs. The speed and ferocity of this demo and KEA quickly got downplayed in favor of stuff that would get mainstream appeal.\n\nIf you do not have this demo, you should get it. Yes, the quality leaves much to be desired. But this record is essential for those interested in the history of metal, those budding Metallica fans who want to know more about where they came from, and Bieber fans as a form of torture. We all can hope that the boys in Metallica can try and get inspiration from this for the next record.\n\nAnd seriously, there needs to be at least one show with this lineup. As far as I know, Dave and Ron are still alive. What's the holdup?\n",
        "\nMetallica's legendary \"Master Of Puppets\" is without the glimpse of a doubt a record any true metal maniac should sooner or later have in his or her collection. Without questioning the great status of this record, I must though admit that the record has always been a little bit flawed by the fact that it is a weaker copy of the groundbreaking previous \"Ride The Lightning\" album. Still, the quality of this copy has a standard of the grandest kind but this is the reason why this record is only very good but not excellent to me.\n\nThe song structures, the way the track list is composed and even some topics are comparable on both records and each one has some advantages and disadvantages. As both albums are very similar, I think that a direct comparison makes a good sense for this special and exceptional occasion.\n\nLet's start with the positive facts first. The title track \"Master Of Puppets\" is better than the great thrash metal anthem \"Ride The Lightning\" because of its more progressive structure, its well developed details and its epic length. Still, both tracks are close to perfection in their unique ways and essential moments of thrash metal. The great and often underrated epic thrash monster with interesting lyrics called \"Disposable Heroes\" easily beats its direct concurrent from the \"Ride Of Lightning\" record which is \"Trapped Under Ice\". A third definite highlight of \"Master Of Puppets\" is the very diversified and addicting instrumental track \"Orion\" that never bores for a second and surpasses the very solid but not outstanding \"The Call Of Ktulu\" from Metallica's second strike.\n\nOn the other side, I think that the mad thrashing head bang monster \"Battery\" lacks of some kind of fond atmosphere which \"Fight Fire With Fire\" had on the previous record. It's the same thing as one compares the great \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" with the even greater and more atmospheric doom thrasher \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\". It's a very tough decision to choose between the hypnotizing and slightly psychedelic \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" and the beautiful half ballad with acoustic parts which was \"Fade To Black\" but the latter one has the certain plus of magic and experimental courage for that time which the other doesn't have. Another tough decision is the duel between \"Leeper Messiah\" and the underrated and often criticized \"Escape\" that sounds maybe too commercial and chorus orientated for some thrash metal hardliners. It's not because of pure opposition that I would go for the latter one but because I think that the song is simply different, more unique and more addicting. Finally, I think that \"Damage, Inc.\", a solid but not outstanding track overall, is beaten by one of Metallica's classics to me which is \"Creeping Death\". \n\nIn the end, \"Ride The Lightning\" wins my direct comparison with five to three points after all but it's really a close ride and both albums are exceptional. On the other side, for the first and only time, Metallica didn't try out something new between two albums and stagnated on a very high level after all. That's why I think that \"Ride The Lightning\" should inherit the status of a cult classic in a fair world and not the slightly overrated \"Master Of Puppets\". Nevertheless, both albums are milestones I don't want to miss that rotate quite often in my sound system when I need a good dose of some classic but already quite complex, elaborated and maybe even progressive thrash metal. Let's also add that the authentic production and the great vintage cover artworks are the best Metallica have ever done to date and add a little supplementary bonus to the powerful spirit of the music.\n",
        "\nSuck. It's the gift that keeps on giving, and Bay Area juggernauts Metallica caught their case right about the time they decided to abandon nearly all traces of sensibility and good taste, around 1993-1994. There have been all manner of arguments through the ensuing decade or so about why such a thing as Load was necessary, and none that I could add upon, but let's just try and apply some common sense here: The Black Album sold megabucks. It's overt simplification and accessibility brought it to an even wider market than their previous blockbusters Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for All. So why not delve a little further into the realm of hot cars, designer clothing and Billboard? Hell, they'd pretty much already arrived on the back of \"The Unforgiven\" alone.\n\nNote that Load's status as 'sellout' or 'not a sellout' does not necessarily resonate or interfere with the actual contents of its music, because it would be wholly naive to think that an album is good or bad concentric to its sales and popularity. Metallica had already been 'selling out' auditoriums, T-shirts and records long before this turd arrived in their colon of creativity, and success was not a novelty. No, the real elephants in the room here are the banal aptitude of the songwriting and the watered derivation of The Black Album formula. This was a band whose 80s output set repeated standards in not only the metal genre, but music as a whole. Masters of Puppets and Kill 'Em All are two of the albums I'd considering among the greatest ever penned by mankind, and Ride the Lightning close behind. Hell, even ...And Justice for All seems like a masterwork of sonic architecture compared to any of the ensuing records, and while it pursued a similar aesthetic of 'dumbing down' the band's central, thundering aggression, The Black Album expressed it with strong songwriting...\n\nBut straight from the get-go, Load seems tailored for rednecks and NASCAR rallies. Not the cool, REAL kind of rednecks, mind you, who would strap you to a gun rack, dowse you in gasoline, read you the Bible and then flick the match. I love those guys. No, this is more of a rock record for people who enjoy bands like Creed and Puddle of Mudd. Fast food hillbillies who gorge on repetitive rock radio. Consummate middle American consumers, whose knowledge of metal music probably fails to extend past Fred Durst's rantings or Ozzy's \"No More Tears\". This is an album that starts off with a song called \"Ain't My Bitch\", and then proceeds into another by the name of \"2 x 4\". We're a long way from \"Trapped Under Ice\" or \"Leper Messiah\", people, but if shitty lyrics, run down alcoholic emotions and songwriting that makes Glenn Danzig seem like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart by comparison are your thing, bid thee welcome to the crushing cornucopia of disappointment.\n\nWelcome Load: the boring rock record, 14 tracks and 79 minutes of LCD commercial rock and roll with only minor inflections of The Black Album wrought through it's Zeppelin-esque blues groove guitars. The heaviest you're going to hear on this record is something like \"Cure\", which comes off as a sort of crossbreed of Danzig and 90s Trouble at best. Or \"King Nothing\", the big single from the album which is basically a re-molding of \"Enter Sandman\", complete with bedtime story lyrics in the bridge! Yeah, sure, there are electric guitars here, slowly noodling along forgettable courses that make \"Sad But True\" seem like a monolith of long lost brutality. I wouldn't remember a thing about \"Ain't My Bitch\", \"Poor Twisted Me\" or \"2 x 4\" if it wasn't for the reprehensible song titles and the fact that this is supposed to be Metallica. For fuck's sake, if you slapped these tracks in the hands of Kid Rock (where they arguably belong), they'd STILL suck.\n\nAre there diamonds in this rough? Not a one. If anything, to distinguish the highs and lows of this flabbergasting failure is to distinguish between the 'wouldn't listen to this today or any other day' tracks and the irreversibly, offensively inane. How about \"Mama Said\", a flirtation with country rock which is about as underwhelming as rock songs are manufactured. Hey, Lars. James. You wanna play country music? Go jam on a fucking Hank Williams, Jr. record. He at least knows what he's doing. Want more ballads? \"Bleeding Me\" gives you about two minutes in the vein of \"The Unforgiven\" before wearing out its welcome with six more minutes of simple escalation that might, if I were generous, yield a single riff sequence of note (around the 5:00 minute mark). Or \"Until it Sleeps\", another of the singles here, which is arguably the best song on the album yet still not fit to lick the boots of \"Nothing Else Matters\".\n\nEven when Metallica start to kick out some Skynyrd/Aerosmith-like boogie grooves in \"Ronnie\" they feel like a phone in. What ever happened to this band's ability to scar the listener's spirit with their hammering thrash riffs, forceful vocals and lyrics of relevance? This has all dissolved into a mockery of what the band once represented, a no compromise streak of superb songwriting which greatly expanded metal's ability to be taken seriously not only by its pre-installed adherents but by the public at large. Even the solos on this album are weak. Love or hate Kirk Hammett, but his work on the previous albums was incredibly memorable even for its lack of outright technical shredding. About the only thing that fit in flushly with this mundane new territory was Lars' drumming, and that's because it was so simple to begin with.\n\nI can understand that bands change, that sounds evolve. I was fully on board when Metallica was considering a less complex follow-up to ...And Justice for All. I would have appreciated it more had they gone in the opposite direction, towards an even more extreme sound, but it made sense that they would not want to repeat themselves. After all, why should they have? They were already on top of the world. They still are. But laziness and the laws of adaptation are no excuses for the sort of banal songs that clutter up this clusterfuck. The world is already choked with mainstream radio channels endlessly cycling boring, formulaic hard rock music to people without the balls to experience real passion in music. Why add another? And why should that other have to be Metallica? Load isn't the worst album ever written, and it's not even the worst from this particular band, but it's not even good for a country-blues pop-rock effort. It reeks of sterile pop polish and crass, wimpy attentions, and funny enough, they smell sort of like a cash register.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIn comparison to the innovating but ultimately rather closed minded debut record, Metallica's Ride The Lightning is a big step forward for the band. In only one year, the band explored new terrain without abandoning its roots and went further than any other band of the genre at the same time. This album is a milestone and has not even lost a glimpse of its charm nowadays. Anybody that contests this is simply a disappointed hater that didn't like the direction this band would later take. \n\nThe classic introduction to the perfect opener \"Fight Fire With Fire\" is the first surprise and a very good idea to contrast the aggressive and powerful head banger. The band also developed its technical skills as the brilliant guitar solos in the title track \"Ride The Lightning\" easily prove. The legend goes even further with the atmospheric doom thrasher \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" that sounds very inspiring to me. The half ballad \"Fade To Black\" proves for the first time that the band can write very emotional, insightful and calm songs and are not only a great thrash metal band. Each of the first four songs is completely unique, adds something new to the sound of the band and justifies the great reception and high rating of this milestone.\n\nThe second half of the record is only slightly weaker. \"Trapped Under Ice\" is a powerful but rather generic thrasher. \"Escape\" is a little bit slower and is rather a melodic heavy metal track with some thrash roots that sounds as if it was heavily inspired by the more melodic New Wave Of British Heavy Metal movement. The song is catchy and less heavy than the other ones and could have been a great single output. \"Creeping Death\" has the high quality of the first half of the record and is another memorable moment of the thrash metal history and an unforgettable live classic. This song has a lot of power and emotion and convinces with its juvenile charm. \"The Call Of Ktulu\" proves that there are some great and often still underrated musicians in the band but the song has not the high class of the later instrumentals or the stunning uniqueness of Burton's memorable bass solo from the first output. It's still a pretty decent and diversified track that could please to fans of thrash, heavy and maybe even progressive metal without the glimpse of a doubt.\n\nIn the end, this great record deserves the legendary status it has today and is one of the biggest milestones of pure thrash metal. On this album, we can already detect that the band would go on a more diversified and experimental path in a few years and try out something new from time to time. This record unites the energy of the juvenile first years and the more complex experiments of the following records in a perfect way and should please to any Metallica fan as it is also easily in my top three albums of this band.\n",
        "\nA different approach from songwriting here - Metallica of the 1980's used to consist only of extreme and fierce thrash metal. Here they've laid back and put forth a solid heavy metal release that really needs recognition. I'd say that the first 5 releases are good then after that they sold out. I wouldn't consider this release to be a sell-out, but they did have a \"happier\" form of Metallica instead of the more darker side of the band.\n\nThe music has heavy distorted riffs throughout this album mixed with some clean tone melodies as was featured on the songs such as \"The Unforgiven\" and \"Nothing Else Matters.\" The guitars on this album are wholly original and thick. Really catchy rhythms, but tempos that are not wholly fast paced as was featured on \"...And Justice For All.\" The band lightened up and put forth heavy metal here. The songs themselves were all noteworthy and deserve praise.\n\nThe guitars all of them fit together - the rhythms, leads, bass all were well mixed to the point to where you could hear everything throughout the album. Hammett's solos featured a lot of use of the wah pedal which meshed well with the rhythms. The acoustics where wholly melodic and noteworthy. Hetfield's voice was such that you could understand what he's saying throughout this entire album. He really sings as opposed to the passed releases which he was more aggressive.\n\nThe bass guitar was barely audible on \"...And Justice For All\", but not on this release. You can hear his efforts this whole album. I really liked that about this album because I think that it was unfair to leave the bass barely audible. The guitar riffs were totally original and unique. Each song had its peaks and valleys with the tracks varying intensely, while overall all tracks were worth hearing.\n\nProduction was awesome as I've previously stated each track was well mixed together so that all of the instruments/vocals/backup vocals were all up to par. That's what was lacking in prior releases - \"...And Justice For All\", \"Master of Puppets\", \"Ride the Lightning\", and \"Kill 'Em All\" all had mixing that were below par. The bass mainly was the problem - it was hard to hear as I mentioned. But on this release everything flew together in right proximity.\n\nA lot of people consider to call this release as being a sell-out. I, too, for a while, was of that same mentality, but after repeated listens to I've concluded that this release was great heavy metal. The song riffs, vocals, bass, and drums all struck me to finally say that it's worth picking up. After this release was their downfall. Straightforward heavy metal is what this Metallica album was all about. Don't miss out on some great tunes here. A milder Metallica, but still very catchy and noteworthy.\n",
        "\nMetallica will always have a special place in my heart as the band that got me into metal. The Black Album was it for me until I decided to do some digging. And found out that, WOAH, Metallica was one of the founders of a genre called thrash metal. Unfamiliar at the time when I was around 12 years old, I decided I would take a listen and I am forever changed because of it. \n\n\u201cRide the Lightning\u201d displays excellent song writing but doesn\u2019t leave out the thrash Metallica was so good at making. \u201cKill Em\u2019 All\u201d was pretty much straight alcoholic thrash metal. While the alcoholism was still there, \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d shows more maturity in their writing styles. \n\nStarting with the production, it\u2019s probably a little better than the debut. The production on RTL is still very raw but it is a step up. The guitars are still crunchy and heavy. The drums sound pretty amazing; except for the fact that the bass drum doesn\u2019t exist except for when he hits a crash but it\u2019s not a big deal. The bass is audible but could be a bit louder. James\u2019 vocals are amazing. I don\u2019t see how anyone could not like his early vocals. They are not as high as \u201cKill Em\u2019 All\u201d but still maintain that angry James Hetfield that I love. \n\nAs far as speed goes, this album still delivers. It\u2019s not as fast as their debut but it still gets the job done. \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d is arguably their fastest song. The riffs are extremely fast. \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d is a pretty mid-paced song that turns into pure thrash during the solo. \u201cTrapped Under Ice\u201d is another full speed thrasher from beginning to end that has some awesome gang vocals. The other speedy song on here is \u201cCreeping Death\u201d. Now it\u2019s not \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d speed but it is still pretty fast. \n\nSong writing has stepped up tremendously on this album. Kirk seemed to write his solos more carefully instead of shredding thrash solos on the debut. The riff in \u201cCreeping Death\u201d is great example of how their writing has improved. \u201cThe Call of Ktulu\u201d is the longest song on here and is an amazing instrumental. The beginning is very creepy and the song is easily as good as or maybe even better than \u201cOrion\u201d. Cliff really shines on this song as well as \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d. \n\nThis album is killer thrash and is essential to own if you like thrash metal. \n\nBest tracks \u2013 \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d, \u201cTrapped Under Ice\u201d, and \u201cCreeping Death\u201d\n",
        "\nMany people say that thrash metal was born with this album. Many people claim that this album has an important role for the history of metal music. Many people argue that this album was the first step of a famous legend. All of those things are true but when it comes to review Metallica's debut album, I would like to leave the nostalgic feelings away and concentrate on the music. That's where I must admit that this album is rather one dimensional and has a few fillers in here. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like this record that is full of energy and emotions and I don\u2019t question its status at all. Many people may now contradict me by saying that thrash metal must sound exactly like this. But the debut albums of \"Overkill\" or \"Voivod\" prove that bands can already innovate within their first albums and sound rather diversified. The only time Metallica try out something else is during the memorable bass solo \"(Anasthesia) Pulling teeth\" which may be one of the greatest bass guitar solos ever recorded in the metal genre. It's simply experimental, diversified and technically of a pretty high standard and one of my favourite tracks in here. This courage, this open minded creativity, this last little kick of genius is what is a little bit missing in here.\n\nThe other nine songs are mostly straight forward thrash metal tracks with sharp riffs, aggressive but melodic vocal lines, fast guitar solos, a pumping bass guitar and a tight drumming. The sound is raw and aggressive and fits perfectly to the songs and the album title itself. The band employs the technical qualities of the heavy metal genre and mixes them with the fast paced energy of the punk wave and unites two genres that were very distinguished at the time and didn't seem to match together. The birth of thrash metal was a first step of the approach of the two genres and their fans. The great opener \"Hit the lights\" hits right my nerve and is a perfect definition of the Bay Area thrash metal genre. A little bit more elaborated tracks like the great grower \"No remorse\" or the catchy band hymn \"Seek and destroy\" work even better and are still a great definition of its genre almost thirty years after the initial release. The killer track \"Whiplash\" is also one of my favourite tracks on the record and varies a little bit more than some too generic songs its riffs, drum loops and melody lines. The song gives you no time to breathe and delivers everything the band stood for back in time. The guitar solo is simply outstanding and proves us that Kirk Hammett was the ideal choice for Metallica and delivers already here a better job than the overrated and arrogant egoist and former guitar player of Metallica Dave Mustaine would ever do. Sorry for the attitude and I apologize to all the \"Megadeth\" maniacs, but that's something where I just felt the need to write it down. Anyway, all those songs can without a doubt be called some classics. \n\nBut next to many catchy and great songs, there are also a few fillers on here that can't hold the high level. \"Motorbreath\" is a short and sweet track but has nothing outstanding to survive. The single \"Jump into the fire\" was not the best choice to spread the name about this young band and the new genre and is a rather overrated track. It's difficult to criticize this bunch of motivated and energized teenagers for some repetition but that might be the only weak point of this album and where there is a thin line between a very good album and an outstanding or even perfect record. That's in the end why my rating is really just slightly below the highest degrees of amazing and absolutely outstanding metal music.\n\nNevertheless, any metal fan should have this great thrash metal record in its collection even if Metallica created even better albums in the next few years in my opinion. This album is a raw definition of the birth of thrash metal with some great and unforgettable classics. But only a few years after, the concurrency and Metallica itself showed us that the summit of thrash metal has not yet been reached yet. They showed us that there was far more to discover than just this respectable beginning of an era. By the way, this album is a grower and gets really addicting and catchy with its simplistic but effective attitude. Anyway, anybody that would like to metal up its ass in an old school way has the perfect record for this right here.\n",
        "\nMan, I can't remember the last time I got compelled to write a positive Metallica review. I'd have to think hard on that one. So Metallica released an album after St. Anger. At this point anything from them would be considered an improvement. You know, Metallica are a band that can release turd after turd and still sellout shows. Just based on their first 5 albums they will carry that name to sold out arenas around the world until they quit. \n\nI must admit when I heard 'This Was Just Your Life' I was pleased to hear them sounding revitalized again and sounding somewhat like the band that made them great. It's weird you know? When you almost think they sound better these days as a hard rock band than a thrash metal band. But that's what Metallica have been most comfortable sounding like for the last 15 plus years. They haven't done a thrash metal album since 1988 and outside of their live shows they stay clear from it. These guys worked so hard in the 80's as a \"working man's band\", a \"people's band\" and they were like us, struggling and hungry for success. The band on this album sound something like those days. Revitalized and reinvigorated, no mental breakdowns from the St. Anger sessions lurking about. \n\nBut the songs are average to be honest. Unforgiven 3 is forgettable and can we please just kill off the Unforgiven series once and for all? As we've all progressed listening to different bands, different styles and so forth. We've all moved on and advanced. Whether your taste is Nevermore, Lamb Of God, etc. Metallica have become stagnant, derivative (creatively speaking). A band who have been passed on by time. They are not cutting edge or even current. They haven't set the bar in decades now and they aren't the \"hot\" band for almost as long. In a way 'The Black Album' was their pact with the devil. Millions of dollars, millions of new fairweather fans, the good life, mansions, expensive cars all at the expense of true diehard fans and creativity. \n\nBecause in a way their creativity has suffered ever since. The game has passed them by, they're the kind of band if you're over 30 you say \"I used to like them in high school\" or if you're 19 and under you say \"my dad used to like them when they were supposedly great.\" Kirk Hammett finally let's loose on this album and shows off his skills again. 'All Nightmare Long' has the thrash back on it, maybe it's just me but I'm tired of James' patented \"ahhh\". At this point I feel he's doing it because he's known for it and he's overdoing it on purpose. The metal version of Michael Jackson's \"shamoan'd\" or \"hee hee\".\n\nCyanide is also a nice track. But on the whole this album feels \"forced\". They knew they fucked up big time on their prior album and they needed to re-trace their steps back about 20 something years and copy it. These guys ran on cruise control the entire 1990's after their \"big\" album that they made releases that were done with their eyes closed and cashed in regardless. I give them credit for trying to make a good album. It's possibly the first time they tried and succeeded in 20 years. On their prior album it sounds like they tried, but forgot how to make metal music again and had failed miserably. They were walking on the mainstream and hard rock bandwagon for so long that I think they didn't even recognize their younger, hungry selves.\n\nI can listen to the album and not cringe, so in that sense this album is a victory for them. For the younger kids out there, there's so many other bands out there to be excited about that do this faster and better. For the older crew this album shows promise and perhaps the band heading into the right direction. What worries me though is that this album does not sound effortless at all. You can tell they really dug deep to sound like a shadow of their former selves. Diehards will say this is a victory against the naysayers. it's more of a small victory. While you can't say Metallica are dead, this album keeps them on life support for a bit longer. At least until the next album 5 years from now.\n",
        "\nIt just had to happen, Metallica wasn't metal anymore. Hard rock is where the future lied for the superstars. This isn't the most ill-advised career re-invention of all time as Metallica show occasional glimpses of what could have been. Metallica's \"Load\" isn't the worst album of all time but a substantial part of it is horribly mediocre. There are a few moments where they pull it off but they can't break free from the chains of mediocrity and inconsistency. They continued to sell records worldwide even if their material after Metallica is sub-par at best. \n\nOne could excuse this band for experimenting but this did not rub off well with the metalheads. This was stage two of Metallica's inevitable fall from grace. The wheels were already set in motion with their previous album. Here, on \"Load\", Metallica was a band which had a bunch of decent ideas in mind but couldn't quite implement them as well as they had imagined they could. \n\nThe production is spotless, may be just a bit too spotless, just as you'd expect from Bob Rock. If you thought Metallica had a clean production, wait till you hear this one, It's even more polished. Too bad that the actual material found here can't match up to the standards of the production. One can't blame Bob Rock for any of Metallica's shortcomings, he did his job and helped sell records. \n\n\"Ain't My Bitch\" is the album's opener, an average rocker with a southern boogie rock vibe and lyrics that get old pretty soon. The riffing is about as generic as they come and the song fails to take off, at all. \"2 X 4\" is a slightly better fare with some decent, heavy grooves and a catchy chorus. The grooves themselves are passable but not quite memorable. \"The House Jack Built\" is surprisingly better than you'd think. The song's best quality is it's driving, momentous chorus and Hetfield's singing. The riff sounds like a slower, looser version of the main riff of \"Ride the Lightning\".\n\nMetallica's newfound love for chorus-driven hard rock is further evident in \"Until it Sleeps\". It's a simple approach, write a catchy chorus, sing the chorus over some thick grooves and that's about all you need to do. \"King Nothing\" is more like it, a more conventional Metallica song with a structure not unlike, \"Enter Sandman\". \"Hero of the Day\" and \"Mama Said\" sees Metallica exploring their softer, bluesier tendencies, both of whom are quite decent, if unspectacular. Lars Ulrich sounds best on the slower, moodier tracks. Hetfield is quite confident of his vocal abilities and for the most part, he delivers.\n\nThere's no need for \"Wasting My Hate\" when there's already \"Ain't My Bitch\". The two songs are basically the same, same approach, same lyrics, same tempo and NOT quite what you'd want to hear from this band. The album has it's share of really terrible duds like \"Cure\", \"Poor Twisted Me\", \"Thorn Within\" and \"Ronnie\". The likes of all these reek of mediocrity and the putrid stench of Nickelback and Creed. \n\nFortunately, there's some good Metallica stuff to be found, two really good songs. \"Bleeding Me\" and \"Outlaw Torn\". Two long epics, in fact. \"Bleeding Me\" sees the best of James Hetfield, the composer and the guitar player. Hetfield is the life of this song with his deep, emotional lyric-writing and his passionate delivery. Kirk Hammett's contributions on this album overall lack substance and memorability but he springs into life on this track with a fantastic guitar solo. Lars Ulrich keeps it very minimalistic and this approach does have it's own novelty as it makes the song sound even heavier. Not to mention the solid bass work from Jason Newsted.\n\nAnd finally, \"Outlaw Torn\", an unsung classic of epic proportions. A song that should rightfully be played more often in Metallica's set lists. A near ten minute epic composition. The monstrous rhythms of Hetfield are back and it's great to see Metallica sound heavy again. The lyrics are written with class and honesty that is to admired. \n\nTo take back what you left me\nI know I'll always burn to be\nThe one who seeks so I may find\nAnd now I wait my whole lifetime\n\nThe lyrics that seemingly any blue-collared listener could understand are just a little insight into the man's life. This is a far cry from the redneck aggression found in the lyrics of \"Ain't My Bitch\". The song's composition is exceptional and dare i say, progressive. The song never jumps out at you and rewards the patient, attentive listener. The highlight of the song is Hetfield's guitar solo towards the end which completely destroys everything from Hammett. The man rarely solos but when he does, you just have to listen. \n\nAs this album finally draws to a close, it's way, way too long with too much filler. It's an album with occasional moments of brilliance, but overall, is pretty tame by any standards, let alone Metallica's standards. It's an album that is hard to recommend to anyone.\n",
        "\nEvery so often, you hear praises being showered endlessly upon \"Master of Puppets\". The year was 1986, Metallica's stepping stone to international superstardom was very well received by the critics, who to this very day still regard this album as the greatest hour in the history of Heavy Metal. That is however, just one side of the spectrum, on the other side are metalheads who loathe the very existence of this album and the band responsible for this 'abomination'. \n\nLet me make an attempt to draw the line here and give a fair judgment. This album isn't perfect, nothing from this era is. The best bands from this era never quite reached the level of perfection achieved by bands such as Black Sabbath or Judas Priest. As in the case of most thrash metal albums, there is a heavy emphasis on skill and athleticism being shown and sometimes they tend to overdo it and lose the 'feel' for the music, which the great rock bands from the 60's and 70's had. Metallica and a few other band tried to keep the 'feel' alive rather than focusing on playing excessively fast or overly technical music. \n\nMetallica aren't a bad influence on Heavy Metal but they became a victim of their own fame. A lot of groove metal and metalcore bands adopted the sound of Metallica and Slayer and bastardized it with their lack of ideas and pressure of adhering to simple minded, mainstream music fans.\n\nA common complaint is repetition, Let me tell you this is no more repetitive than any other great album. The quality of the songwriting is such that they successfully manage to strike the right balance between the long choruses and the limited riff-set. Apart from a few lapses on tracks such as \"Disposable Heroes\" and \"The thing that should not be\", both of which tend to drag on for just a little too long, The song lengths themselves are fine and have more than enough variety in them to make them memorable. The title track \"Master of Puppets\" is perhaps the best example of this, the song has a wonderful, lengthy melodic instrumental section which brings everything to a standstill, almost. The melodies themselves are complex and very 'spacey', specially Hetfield's solo work, which are found less often but tends to overshadow Hammett's contributions in terms of quality. Not to mention the main riff of \"Master of Puppets\" is one of the greatest riffs ever written.\n\nThe album's mainstay is Hetfield's intense rhythm guitar playing which forms the foundation on which the band explore all their ideas. \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" is perhaps Metallica's best ballad. Continuing in the footsteps of \"Fade to Black\", the band explores very depressing themes in the lyrics, this time, a feeling of being powerless and trapped in an asylum and in the end breaking out of it. \n\nGot some death to do\nMirror stares back hard\nKill, it's such a friendly word\nSeems the only way\nFor reaching out again\n\nThe lyrics aren't subtle, not pretty but they're effective. The song starts off with a minimal riff followed by some classy intro solos by Kirk Hammett which paints a bleak, sad outlook from the beginning. The vocals get harsher and the riffs become heavier with heavy use of downpicking as the song progresses. Overall, It's not as heavy as \"Fade to Black\" or \"One\" with a lot more hard rock influences than being straight forward thrash. Perhaps, It's songs like these which deal with personal struggles that gave rise to grunge and other assorted genres later. \n\n\"The thing that should not be\" was a new approach to the band. In all it's downtuned fury, the main riff is abused a few too many times for it's own good and the song's novelty starts dying pretty fast. The lyrics do save it though. The Chtulhu mythos make for interesting listening, The chorus itself is undeniably catchy. \n\n\"Disposable Heroes\" drags on for too long, just a tad too long. The album's second 8 minute epic of this album delivers but falls short of being the principle winner in the lot. The band's first attempt at exploring war-themed topics is a hit-and-miss citing the lyrics, which are often found to be too predictable. The instrumental work itself is quite brilliant, however. Possibly the most complex song off this album. The song maintains a high tempo after it's relatively slow introduction with Hetfield and Hammett both working in tandem, showing off their brilliant chemistry with some very aggressive, fast tempo-ed riffs and lightning fast solos. \n\n\"Leper Messiah\" is an often overlooked song, It's a good indication of where the band wanted to go in the near future. It's a heavier, slower song with heavy emphasis on chorus and the lyrics. Certainly one of Metallica's most underrated efforts.\n\n\"Battery\" and \"Damage, Inc\" are two visceral, face-shredding thashers, The likes of both are considered thrash metal classics. 'Battery' starts off with a simple, Spanish flavored guitar intro but don't be fooled as it breaks into a minimalistic, in-your-face main riff that is hard to resist. \"Battery\" also has one of the most massive thrash breaks in the history of metal, occurring twice, guaranteed to make a mosh pit go insane. \"Damage, Inc\" simply exists to smash your face in. The sheer aggression and attitude will flatten anything in it's way like a freight-train. The two songs deliver the perfect one-two knockout punch. One at the beginning and the other at the end.\n\nThat leaves one behind, \"Orion\". Metallica's second instrumental is simply amazing. It's a song for the Metallica fans to remember Cliff Burton by. It takes exceptional songwriters with vision, intelligence, grace and taste to compose something like this. The song is best remembered for it's timeless and beautiful solo work by Burton first and then Hetfield. Metallica had a knack of creating melodies that was far beyond their peers. It's works like these that really set them apart.\n\nMake of it what you will but to this day, more than a decade after hearing this album the first time, \"Master of Puppets\" still stands tall and towers above most albums. Very few albums can stand the test of time like this album does. People have a very biased opinion on Metallica but let's forget all that. This was before the St. Anger abomination and well before they sued Napster or headlined lollapalooza and toured with Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park. This was Metallica, the young band who were hungry and produced a truly remarkable, timeless album for generations to come.\n",
        "\nHaving decided to travel to Warsaw, Poland, to be at the inaugural \u2018Big 4\u2019 event I was eagerly anticipating the release of this boxset, not least because as a vertically challenged individual I was able to see very little from my position 300 yards back at Bemowo Airport on that historic day in mid-2010.\n\nThis release, the deluxe boxset which includes CD and DVD recordings of all four bands, would enable me to watch the show in Sofia in sharp detail which I had no hope of when in a crowd of near 100,000 in Warsaw.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t disappoint. The item itself is nicely put together, although I would have been happy to pay \u00a320 ($31) for the CDs and DVDs without the poster, guitar pick, photos, booklet etc for which I ended up paying \u00a345 ($70). Sturdy, well made and a good piece of metal memorabilia.\n\nBut what about the performances? Well first up is Anthrax, the band which, arguably, held onto their spot in the Big 4 by the skin of their teeth throughout the mid-80s. Some would argue for Exodus, though on the strength of five great albums from 1985 to 1990 I would have chosen Kreator but then a European band would never make the Big 4!\n\nAnthrax\u2019s rough and ready debut, Fistful Of Metal lead on to two great albums \u2013 the ground breaking Spreading The Disease, and the hyperspeed/mosh orgy of Among The Living. These were the albums that Anthrax secured their place in the Big 4 with. Of course, they released two more well respected, if not particularly well received, albums after these. So this leads to a fundamental question \u2013 why, in a set of ten songs, do Anthrax choose to play two covers - Joe Jackson\u2019s \u2018Got The Time\u2019 and Trust\u2019s \u2018Antisocial\u2019? Plus a shortened cover of \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019 by the band of the same name?\n\nWhile Anthrax are fun to watch onstage and put in a good performance musically and physically (including Joey Belladonna\u2019s strained vocals) to play two full covers in a ten song set is unforgiveable when tracks like \u2018Among The Living\u2019 and \u2018Gung Ho\u2019 were overlooked. Add to this the addition of \u2018Only\u2019, a song from an era of Anthrax that most grunge fans will enjoy and most thrash fans cringe at, and \u2018Medusa\u2019, one of the weakest, most commercial tracks from Spreading... and you have the makings of a poor set.\n\nAnthrax\u2019s enthusiasm cannot be questioned here, but their set list raises big questions for me as to whether they really understood the significance of this occasion.\n\nNext up \u2013 Megadeth. Put simply, on this performance and that in Poland, Megadeth are THE band to see at the moment. Very, very well produced sound, maybe the best sound I have ever heard on a live recording. Incredible musicianship. Mustaine and Broderick are tight as fuck on guitar duty; Newly, and rightfully, reinstated Dave Ellefson is excellent on bass guitar with his tight picked rhythms nicely high in the mix. Shawn Drover\u2019s drumming is flawless, and while you won\u2019t hear Nick Menza\u2019s powerhouse beats or Gar Samuelson\u2019s (RIP) syncopated jazz-influenced flamboyancy, what you do get is a totally heavy bass-drum driven barrage.\n\nThe set is just what was needed after Anthrax\u2019s weak start \u2013 opener \u2018Holy Wars...\u2019 giving way to \u2018Hangar 18\u2019, followed by \u2018Peace Sells...\u2019. After that comes nine more great songs, including a rousing rendition of \u2018A Tout le Monde\u2019. Absolutely fucking brilliant performance from a great band.\n\nSo how do you follow that? One word. Slayer.\n\nShould Slayer have played after Megadeth? It\u2019s arguable. On album performance over the last 27 years, yes. On their respective performances on the night, no, Megadeth ruled. But Slayer is Slayer. What you see is what you get. If, like me, Slayer is your favourite band ever and you have seen Slayer play on any number of occasions (last count maybe 15 times) then you know what you\u2019re in for, and this was no different. Pure fucking heads down aggression from start to finish.\n\nSlayer regularly mix their set up show by show and this one, sadly, contained nothing from Show No Mercy or Hell Awaits. However, \u2018War Ensemble\u2019, \u2018Hate Worldwide\u2019, \u2018Chemical Warfare\u2019 and the obligatory \u2018Raining Blood\u2019 will surely have given many of the newbie Metallica kids a headache.\n\nAs always, Hanneman and King are solid but raw and somewhat sloppy. The sound and mix are unforgiving on this recording for the guitar duo. Tom\u2019s vocals are good but still show signs of inexorable decline. On a couple of occasions he misses lyrics having invited the crowd to sing them. James Hetfield can do this in an arena this size, Tom can\u2019t, the response isn\u2019t loud enough. If you\u2019re watching the DVD it is apparent why there\u2019s no vocals but if you\u2019re listening to the CD then it sounds a little lame.\n\nThe stand out performance with Slayer is Dave Lombardo. He is superb, an absolute wall of unrelenting aggression played from the heart and with absolute conviction. For a 45 year old man this is utterly awesome.\n\nSo with Slayer bowing out with a brutal \u2018Raining Blood\u2019 the crowd eagerly awaits the main event \u2013 Metallica.\n\nOk, Metallica shows have been reviewed a million times, and by far more accomplished writers than me, so I am not going to give the typical critique, but I will give some observations.\n\nFirstly the set. Really good mix of old and new. They kick off with the all-time classic \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 which is followed by \u2018For Whom The Bell Tolls\u2019. After these come tracks from every Metallica album except Load and St Anger.\n\nAnd Metallica kick ass. As usual. They put on a great show with great crowd interaction, great visuals, great songs, just... great. But for me there\u2019s one thing which means I cannot listen to this show \u2013 Lars Ulrich.\n\nFrom the very start with \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 Lars lets the side down. Ulrich hasn\u2019t used a ride cymbal for over 20 years. He has a 5-piece drum kit. He simply cannot provide the percussion which a band of Metallica\u2019s standard and stature needs. His drumming makes a mockery of it all. That may sound harsh, but as a drummer I know what is required and he cannot provide it.\n\nHis drumming on \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 is horrible. He can\u2019t play tom rolls \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have the toms. His playing is too fast, too frantic. Metallica sound so lightweight, even on their heavier tracks, that I have to switch off. I will stick to recordings I have from the early- and mid-80s. This is Metallica \u2018lite\u2019, and while I think they do put on a great show, they are in danger of becoming an exhibition band.\n\nListen to Megadeth and Shawn Drover, and Slayer and Dave Lombardo, then listen to Lars Ulrich. Sorry Lars but....\n\nSo, the Big 4 Sofia boxset \u2013 a superb memento of a great event. Megadeth win this one hands down. In fact hands anywhere. They rule this show and they ruled the tour. If you can get your hands on this limited edition version then do, it is well worth it. \n\nIf not then seek out the DVD only version \u2013 you can still annoy your neighbours, just turn your TV the fuck up.\n\n(Originally reviewed for www.braingell.com)\n",
        "\nLet me to start off by saying that I\u2019m a metal-head, proud and loyal, not some mainstream kid who believes that the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are the most talented band ever, or that Justin Bieber has the best voice in the industry. I love metal, but I can appreciate it when bands choose to change their musical direction. Metallica has been consistently assaulted with harsh, negative reviews with labels like \u201cSell-out\u201d, \u201cMainstream\u201d and \u201cAlternative\u201d, following the release of Load and ReLoad. These widespread propaganda-like statements not only prove the narrow-minded intolerance of the writer, but, in many cases have caused listeners to develop a very negative attitude to the record, before giving it a fair go. Before analysing the music of ReLoad, let us sort out a few pressing issues:\n\n1. Metallica did not sell out... If by following your musical interests and believing in a change of direction is selling out, then I\u2019ve lost all faith in the musical community.\n\n2. Metallica is not mainstream... Despite a less aggressive approach, Load and ReLoad do not crossover into the mainstream audience. Perhaps Metallica is no longer the underground thrash metal act it used to be, but by no means is it a mainstream crowd-pleasing pussy band.\n\n3. Metallica is not an \u2018Alternative\u2019 band... Yes, there are songs that have alternative rock tendencies, but not to the extent of R.E.M. or modern Good Charlotte.\n\nOkay, now... ReLoad is definitely not my favourite Metallica album (that would be a three way tie between Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for All), but this does not distort the fact that it is musically worthwhile.\n\nThe approach undertaken by Metallica is very similar to their style on Load, an emphasis on hard rock, as opposed to its\u2019 heavy metal predecessor, the Black Album. In fact, ReLoad contains songs that were originally intended to be released on Load, as a 2CD album, and true to this, ReLoad seamlessly continues the trend. From the initial moments of crowd-favourite Fuel, the opening track, it is clear to the listener that Metallica has committed to another hard rock record. The heavy riff-age and rock-style drumming provides a perfect insight into the tracks to come. These form the backbone of the album.\n\nGone are the blazing guitar solos and furious choruses of Master of Puppets and Justice. Metallica, instead, seems to have expanded on the more abstract techniques, such as those found in Load\u2019s \u2018The House That Jack Built\u2019. This is clearly demonstrated in songs like The Memory Remains, Slither, Where the Wild Things Are, and Low Man\u2019s Lyric. Hetfield digitally disfigures his voice, rather annoyingly, in several instances like Slither\u2019s chorus (\u201cSee you crawling\u201d), creating an almost whining impression. This element, I believe, adds nothing to the value of the song, and is the only thing I truly dislike about this album. Ulrich\u2019s drumming is permanently slower, with the exception of \u2018Fuel\u2019 and parts of \u2018Bad Seed\u2019, further cementing the bands departure from metal. Whilst I have always respected Lars for his efforts in the classic albums, and more recently, St. Anger and Death Magnetic, his performance in Load and ReLoad is rather slow (and, dare I say, occasionally boring). Jason Newsted, the bands\u2019 \u201cenergy bunny\u201d, as claimed by Lars, is still struggling to be heard, despite the clear and polished production; and Kirk Hammett\u2019s solos are less-than-memorable, and few and far between. \nReLoad does, however, have its fair share of \u2018keepers\u2019:\n\n\u2022 The Unforgiven II is a simply beautiful, melodic sequel to the original. James\u2019 voice is strong, yet soothing, full of purpose and emotion. The powerful chorus amplifies the mood, contrasting the softer, more placid verses. I get shivers thinking of how good it is. Possibly the most underrated song on the album.\n\n\u2022 Prince Charming is a catchy, faster paced hard rocker. The opening riff draws me in every time I listen to it. The chorus (\u201cHey look, it\u2019s me! The one who can\u2019t be free. Much too young to focus, but too old to see,\u201d) seals the deal. Again, very underrated.\n\n\u2022 Fuel. If you\u2019re even only a small time fan of Metallica, Fuel is bound to be one of the first songs you come across. Energetic and thick, Fuel remains a staple element of Metallica\u2019s set list.\n\n\u2022 The Memory Remains is a more obscure form of hard rock. The guest vocals (courtesy of Marianne Faithfull) during the \u2018outro\u2019, are strange, yet create an eerie, fading atmosphere. Nonetheless a very worthwhile song.\n\nLyrically, Metallica seems to have taken a couple of steps backwards. Unlike the fiery anthems such as the environmentally motivated \u2018Blackened\u2019, or the truth-seeking \u2018Eye of the Beholder\u2019, the lyrics presented in ReLoad seem to lack a greater meaning. For example, Fuel. Driving really fast cars, really dangerously. An immature topic (reminiscent from the adolescent \u2018Motorbreath\u2019), and definitely absent from a greater sense of purpose. This may not be of concern to you, but personally, I take great pride in listening to good music with sensible and purposeful lyrical content. To me, it just proves that a band is not only a group of talented musicians, but a group of vigilant and aware individuals. Metallica is certainly capable of being in this category of \u201cmeaningful metal\u201d; however ReLoad is a letdown in this regard.\n\nConcluding, ReLoad is not Metallica\u2019s fastest production, nor is it their best. What ReLoad is, is a catchy, thick-and-heavy album, which embraces less-traditional musical techniques and explores new horizons set forth by Load. I strongly encourage the reader not to judge this album from the harsh reviews it has so often received. I implore you not to jump on the bandwagon. If ReLoad is listened to with an open mind, I guarantee it will pleasantly surprise.\n",
        "\nJust as the old saying goes that all roads lead to Rome, so to do all significant roads in the development of metal go back to the murky underworld of the late 70s and early 80s. One can\u2019t really speak of the style without getting into its beginning primacy in England and America, though by said era Germany was also becoming a key player with several others on the way. And it is in the context of the odd relationship that England and America share musically that plays into the birthing of thrash metal, particularly that of the Metallica, Metal Church, Overkill Trifecta. The horseracing term does have an appropriate application given that there is often debate over which one of these 3 bands actually offered up the first consistent version of the style in a song, but from a historical standpoint, Metallica\u2019s impact was the largest, at least in first couple of years, and their influence continued on even as the style moved away from their version of it.\n\nIf nothing else, Metallica\u2019s legacy begins and ends with their commitment to the road and the stage, as their mass propagation of demo releases headlining their jazzed up answer to the NWOBHM pretty well got the ball rolling. But when approaching the now collector\u2019s item demo \u201cNo Life \u2018Til Leather\u201d, it\u2019s very important to note that while the band definitely was taking some cues from Motorhead, the signature sound that became \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d is very different from their pre-label era. This is a band that was still well wrapped up in the rock clich\u00e9s that many of the British bands at the time were just beginning to move away from, and this primarily differs from those outfits in speed and degrees of intensity. It\u2019s not really that out of line to speculate as to what genre Metallica was actually in from a historical standpoint when encountering another demo from around this period dubbed \u201cPower Metal\u201d, because when combined with the heavily effects drenched guitars and vocals, alongside the lighter character of things in general, this could be mistaken from an early USPM release at times.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a host of differences that will stick out like a sore thumb to anyone who has not heard this yet is already familiar with Metallica\u2019s extensive studio collection, particularly the stuff after \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d. The lower fidelity production reveals a band that sounds almost like a coked up version of Diamond Head with a bunch of odd changeups. Likewise, the songs are generally shorter in length, faster in tempo, and are lyrically much more tongue-in-cheek and all but devoid of the occult aspects that would show up on \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d. Nearly every song on here save the Leather Charm songs and \u201cMetal Militia\u201d have significant chunks absent, mostly because they were modified after Mustaine was booted to either give more time for Kirk to do his pentatonic runs, or to let the song coast on in a more epic fashion. But most noteworthy of all is the radically different sound of Hetfield\u2019s vocals. As best as I can tell, his voice had not fully matured yet or something else to that effect, because he hits note on here that are in John Arch territory, and his voice is remarkably clean and slightly sleazy, as opposed to the grit and gravel that most tend to recognize from his vocals circa 1986 onward.\n\nThe availability factor is naturally an issue for anyone looking to get this remarkable slice of metal history in its original format, but both God and Al Gore have blessed us all with another means so any who have yet to look into this recording, consider this your ultimatum to get with the program. From my end of things, this is the most brilliant thing that Metallica has ever done, and despite being a bit dated has a timelessness to it that separates it from even the studio highpoints of this band\u2019s early career. The drums are not performed perfectly, the guitars are mixed a bit unevenly, but when compared to a number of demos out there from more recent times, this is a solid accomplishment with very limited means. The only thing that might have made it even better is if they had gotten Cliff in the band before this was put together, but even without his fancy additives, this cuts with the fury of a thousand broad swords. So break out those dusty old Metallica t-shirts and leather coats, and let us remember that grand old days when metal was still metal.\n",
        "\nAnd Justice For All, a point in the iconic Metallica's career when they ran out of ideas to the extreme limit. So for their next record Metallica make major changes in their music. In this album Metallica quit playing thrash metal altogether. The music is mid paced and even laid-back at times, a stark contrast from their \"slaves Hebrews born to serve\" days. The music is much more influenced by ACDC which may not be a good thing but yeah the band pulls in off quite well.\n\nThe music constructed is such that it fits Metallica's lack of instrumental talent perfectly. Lars Ulrich no longer has to think about multi-tracking the drum tracks as his drumming skills suit the mid paced nature of the songs. So now we do not need to complain about poor quality drumming anymore (not that he drums excellently, but still his past performances...). The riff work is so-so. Metallica always had a problem in writing mid paced riffs and on this album the problem becomes a menace. The lead work is good and so is the bass work. The vocals play a major role in the album and thankfully Hetfield sounds good for the first (and only) time in his life. I wonder why he didn't die of the shock. The vocals vary from calm whispers to heavy growls and Hetfield puts a lot of efforts in them.\n\nThe album opens with Enter Sandman which may have sounded hideous in the single, but here in the album it does not sound that bad. The problem with it is that it is quite harmless like an 'Iron Maiden Number Of The Beast' in which nothing eventful occurs and which just plods along it's length. Sad But True is much better. It is slow even slower than the opener, but heavy, crushing and the way Hetfield sings it...it is quite amazing. Holier Than Thou is where all the fans of Metallica would feel at home. It is the first song which can be labeled as thrash metal. Don't Tread On Me is similar and also quite as enjoyable. Wherever I May Roam is the highlight of the album. Everything in the sing from the intro to the huge chorus, the solo, verses, and also lyrics rock hard. It is another midpaced like sandman but this time every element in the song works perfectly as these guys wanted. Nothing Else Matters is a love ballad and much controversial song. It is as if it's arule to hate this song in metal circles. And why not? A thrash metal band playing sissy love ballads? Hideous crap, right? Wrong. Not for this particular case. Hetfield sings amazingly and the atmophere created by the synths is also amazing. Another such song is The Unforgiven. Though it may not be a ballad, it contains many soft parts like Fade To Black. Where Fade To Black contained soft verses and heavy chorus, this one contains heavy verses and soft chorus. And the chorus, what an amazing chorus it has! The solo is also quite amazing. Overall this is the best song from the album. Of Wolf And Man increases the pace by several notches and so we can't be put off. This song is another highlight. The God That Failed and My Friend Of Misery are midpaced in the vein of Sad But True and again quite good songs. They would have sounded much better if the choruses had been better. The Struggle Within is another fast cut and ends the album on a positive note.\n\nContrary to popular belief, this according to me is a comeback album of sots after the so-so Master Of Puppets and the disaster known as And Justice For All. This album is much more consistent, the songwriting is much more competent and thus in all angles is a much more balanced album. The filler content which was much higher compared to any respectable album in the last two records is reduced here. There are only two or three songs out of the twelve which are not enjoyable and that much consistency is good. It has been a fashionable thing to slam this album since it sold many copies and pushed Metallica out of their underground status into overnight stars. Yeah I agree that the stuff released after this sucks big time and that this album was responsible for the release of abominations known as Load, Reload. I also agree that this album inspired countless other bands to change their musical direction into commercial crap. But as long this album is an enjoyable one we can't just slam it for it's negative influence. Also this album serves as an excellent intro album into heavy metal. Having it's share of thrashy, midpaced, catchy, simple tracks and even ballads, this album can be an intro album. I have seen many punks who used to sport dyed spike haircut and Bon Jovi t shirts now listening to Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath all due to this album. I'll recommend this album to any one listening to MUSIC and wanting to check out heavy metal is, as for the metal heads I doubt if there is anyone who has not heard it. But then if you haven't go and get it.\n",
        "\nAs stated in my previous review of the \u201cWhiplash\u201d single/EP, I have been both a bit puzzled and slightly chuckled at the aggravation over the so-called fake crowd noise that was employed on the two songs found on the b-side. From my standpoint, this is little different than simply adding additional instruments beyond what a 4 piece thrash band is capable of pulling off in a live setting. My disapproval of \u201cJump In The Fire\u201d as a single is not centered on any sort of lack of integrity in the practices of the band, but in its sheer pointlessness as a release. There is literally nothing unique about this release, and as such, it stands as the earliest example of why many accuse this band of being cash grabbers.\n\nThe contents of this obviously need no introduction, apart from maybe a mention that Dave Mustaine\u2019s handiwork is where things really shine. \u201cJump In The Fire\u201d stands as among the more unique Metallica song ever put together, resting comfortably in mid-tempo land and relying on a signature, mostly blues based riff assault. Kirk\u2019s lead work is naturally all over the pentatonic box, shelling out rapid fire drone licks at light speed succession, and giving the song a slight feel of quickness that is otherwise not present. James\u2019 vocal attack is gravely and somewhat garbled, but really on point and perhaps the lone thing that separates this from being a longer version of a NWOBHM song.\n\nThe remaining songs on here, though contentious in their presentation here, are excellent demonstrations of how Metallica\u2019s songwriting style was paving the way for future innovation. The usual concept of verse/chorus sections is still present, but is expanded upon in a somewhat similar way to that of the extended jam style of Sabbath, but tempered into a stricter and tighter format with actual new sections rather than wandering solo sections. But once again, I must stress, there is nothing unique to this release. It was a waste of money when it was put out, and would be more of one at an inflated price even for the most rabid Metallica completists.\n",
        "\nFrom the primordial swamp of early metal ala Mot\u00f6rhead, several members of the NWOBHM, and the fringe extreme representative Venom, the phenomenon now known as Metallica and with it the beloved sub-genre of thrash was born. Moving beyond the simply sped up rehash of darker rock in the 70s, this music sought to refine the evil sounds of Black Sabbath and a few others and present a truly menacing style. \u201cWhiplash\u201d is among the better representations of how the newly forming genre began to move away from the safety of mid-tempo land and introduced a heavier riffing style that would be further explored on Slayer\u2019s \u201cHaunting The Chapel\u201d and consequently, further darkened.\n\nFor those who have already picked up a copy of \u201cKill Em\u2019 All\u201d, there is very little to be heard here that is new or different. One exception is some crowd noise on two of the songs, which is admittedly nothing more than a studio trick added on to a studio recording. While some have viewed this as a dishonest method of recreating a live experience on a record, it was not an unheard of practice in some circles, and even Helloween decided to give it ago not too long after. The other, and perhaps the only real point of interest here is the remixed version of \u201cWhiplash\u201d, which is actually a slight improvement as the additional reverb and consequentially distant sound of the whole all but fully recaptures that stage-like character of early Mercyful Fate.\n\nUltimately, not a really essential purchase, but an interesting footnote in the early days of Metallica. It\u2019s a little interesting to hear everybody cry \u201cFake!!!\u201d at the versions of \u201cSeek And Destroy\u201d and \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d, but I can\u2019t really get too upset over it. As that famous and highly ironic quote about Hollywood movies in the film \u201cSimone\u201d says, \"we don\u2019t mind that you created something fake, as long as you don\u2019t lie about it\".\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve always had the view that when dealing with a metal album that crosses over into the mainstream, the general rule is that the singular song that is most responsible for propelling it into its status embodies all that is both right and wrong with the entire album. This view largely came into being with regards to my view of Metallica\u2019s first break into MTV culture \u201cOne\u201d, a video that robbed me of my 9 year old innocence when I first saw it, subjecting me to nightmares, and giving a little extra punch to my father\u2019s stories about the correlation between war and hell. Indeed, this song was my actual introduction to real metal, and left an impression that still shapes my views on it to this day.\n\nNevertheless, after a little more than 20 years of reflection of this song and experiencing the highly varied and eclectic genre that birthed it, I\u2019ve come to note a certain duality to it. On the one hand, this song is an ingenious melding of balladry and fast paced thrashing, the former element including some occasional borrowing from the introductory material of \u201cFade To Black\u201d (though rhythmically reinterpreted). But on the other, this is a song that functions more on piling ideas on top of each other more so than really moving in a progressive direction. The acoustic sections are actually quite tantalizing and the drum work is mildly intricate, but Hetfield\u2019s vocal melodies are extremely flat and anti-climactic, all but fading into the mix save perhaps the adequate lyrical content. When things pick up towards the latter half of the song, so does Hetfield\u2019s vocal assault, but ultimately the guitars are what drive this beast along.\n\nThe remaining elements going on about the song are of varying consequence, but definitely deserve consideration. It\u2019s well known that the bass is all but a non-factor on all of \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d, but this song as actually among the few examples where a greater bass presence would have complemented the song rather than clashed with the arrangement, particularly during the quiet sections. By contrast, the lead guitar plays an even more key role here than it has otherwise on previous albums, building upon the melodic tendencies of earlier ballad songs/sections from the previous 2 albums, and coming to a head at the climatic shred section, which is among the few solos present on Metallica\u2019s albums that lends itself to recall rather than mere identification.\n\nFor the prospective buyer who has yet to purchase \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d but has seen the famed music video for this song, this is a pretty revealing sample of what the album is in its fullness. It is an album that places a little too much emphasis on repetition and goes longer than it needs to, but is not devoid of powerful material. Seeking out this single isn\u2019t really necessary as the chunkier, nastier version of Diamond Head\u2019s \u201cThe Prince\u201d is also to be found on \u201cGarage Inc.\u201d, but as with all famous songs, taking an occasion to reexamine why the song moves or annoys you is not a waste of time.\n",
        "\nWhile the reasoning behind why \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d was a controversial release among thrashers varies depending on who you talk to, it is pretty well established that Metallica has veered back and forth in terms of style since the latter half of the 80s, and this single is probably the most blatant demonstration of it. Between the razor thin, high end, and fairly dry production and the angrier than ever vocal display out of James Hetfield is a band that seems to be trying to please everyone, throwing a little bit of this and that from one song to the next.\n\n\u201cHarvester Of Sorrow\u201d reflects a latent doom metal tendency that began to surface here and there on the famed 4th studio album, drawing heavily from a number of minimalist ideas that had been surfaced a few years prior by Candlemass and more than a decade prior by Sabbath. However, the salient point of the style that all but completely flew over the heads of these guys is that when you deal in heavily repetitive and slowed down music, atmosphere is king, and what is presented as such here couldn\u2019t be passed off as a lowly knight\u2019s squire. The trebly guitar tone, the detached rhythmic tendencies of the drums and the non-existent bass don\u2019t work in this setting, to speak nothing for how stale the flat implied vocal and guitar melodies become after a couple of listens.\n\nNevertheless, the band really gets the job done nicely in the b-side department, and would make this an good pickup if found at a reasonable price, provided that money wasn\u2019t already thrown at the cash grabber rereleases of these songs of late. The Diamond Head cover is particularly of note given that it presents Metallica reinterpreting their former style of 1982-84 but through the darker lens of their 1988 sound. The top-heavy production works well against the proto-speed/thrash nature of the original song, and Hammet\u2019s solo work is top notch. The cover of \u201cBreadfan\u201d is also a revealing song, showing that as far back as 1973 there were bands predicting the very style that became so widespread in the 80s, while still having that signature pentatonic riffing approach common to early 70s rock.\n\nIt\u2019s a judgment call on whether to get this given that \u201cGarage Inc.\u201d has this along with a lot of the other famous 80s Metallica cover songs on it. It mostly hinges on whether you want all of the crappy 90s stuff that comes with the latter package, though getting a cheap used copy of said compilation might be a safer bet from a monetary standpoint. But on its own, this is one of the few singles out there where the a-side sucks but the b-sides are pure auditory treasure, and the wicked album art has to count for something.\n",
        "\nMetallica\u2019s history has been probably the most contentious of any within metal\u2019s 4 decade history, let alone within the narrower spectrum of their co-pioneered sub-genre within it. The biggest mistake made in judging them is assuming that they were constant trailblazers throughout the entire 80s, though there is definitely something to be said about the products of their infancy circa 1982-84. The second biggest mistake is attempting to throw out the baby with the bathwater by allowing unearned judgment of their past material to be visited due to the repeated commercial pandering and musical failures of the past 20 years. Nevertheless, some of the band\u2019s widely heralded albums are not beyond criticism in this regard, be it what these albums ended up influencing or simply in what changed from before. It all really breaks down to priorities, and it is by the merits of the contents that \u201c...And Justice For All\u201d should be judged.\n\nAs a whole, this album could be chalked up to a longer, expanded version of \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d minus not only Cliff Burton, but the bass as any sort of a consequential instrument. Contrary to popular opinion, the bass is not a complete non-factor, though its presence would only be missed if it were to be completely removed from the mix altogether. But with the recent advent of the master tapes having been communicated and a few alternative mixes with the bass\u2019 presence augmented, it can be safely stated that this was not only an inevitability that the bass was taken down significantly, but the best outcome as well. The overtly tinny character of the guitars and the semi-clicking tendency to the bass drum (a precursor to the annoying sound often heard out of some present day death metal bands) utterly clashes with Newstead\u2019s dark 5-string bass, and short altering the tone of everything else to the point where this would have sounded exactly like \u201cThe Black Album\u201d, the mix results would have been abysmal.\n\nBut while the overall character of the album\u2019s mix is extremely high end and a complete departure from past efforts, this is largely where the innovative aspects of this album leave off. Some might quibble over the fact that the songs are longer and more involved, and thus this crosses over into progressive territory. Such assertions would seem to downplay the innovations of several Bay Area bands that actually went beyond mere ad nauseam repetition and actually increased the riff set to something really intricate as in \u201cTime Does Not Heal\u201d or \u201cVictims Of Deception\u201d. Likewise, when considering the wide array of bands exploring harsher vocal tones (Sodom and Morbid Saint), keyboard and effects usage (Voivod), more adventurous musical contrasts (Megadeth), or even mixing in creepy atmospheric and melodically dissonant qualities in place of speed and mayhem (Slayer). These songs are long, and there is a fair amount of complexity, but they tend to be the former simply for the sake of it, while the latter category mostly comes into play with Hammet\u2019s lead playing, which is still fairly one-dimensional, but at least more melodically intricate than his work on \u201cPuppets\u201d.\n\nIt might be considered unfair to compare this album against other bands who most likely took influences from Metallica at some point (save Megadeth) and who released their comparable material after this album. But it becomes inevitable given a large sentiment amongst certain circles that this band is the tip of the iceberg and often becomes the token thrash band of people who couldn\u2019t give a damn about the genre. The innovative qualities of the contents on here in regards to past work could be chalked up to an angrier and more cynical view of humanity and life, which is hardly anything new even within pre-metal rock bands. This is communicated through songs that are either slowed down, or otherwise expanded in scope through repetition or very slight variation in order to make room for more lyrics and still pay equal attention to instrumental sections. Perhaps the biggest examples of this trend is the overlong title song and the band\u2019s first commercial breakthrough \u201cOne\u201d, which pile on the repetition like crazy while putting an emphasis on expanded verse and chorus sections, all of them preceded by an overabundant amount of segue material.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of the ideas that were put together can suffer the repetition factor and come through with their luster intact. Even some of the slower material such as \u201cThe Frayed Ends Of Sanity\u201d and \u201cEye Of The Beholder\u201d manage to stay interesting despite a limited riff set that is largely based around a slightly varied verse/chorus structure. Similarly, although it takes a while to get going, \u201cThe Shortest Straw\u201d works quite well as an upper mid-tempo version of their formerly blistering thrash style, and manages to come off intelligently lyrically withal the corniness in Hetfield\u2019s clich\u00e9 rhyme schemes. But in some cases things just take too long to get going and turns into a hypnotic binge of slower metallic grooves, particularly in the case of the overlong \u201cTo Live Is To Die\u201d and the utterly boring \u201cHarvester Of Sorrow\u201d, the latter of which is a good precursor towards the dumbed down character of \u201cThe Black Album\u201d.\n\nThere is a sentiment that this album is an ancestor of the soon to follow half-thrash craze of the early 90s, and examining the lack of consistently thrashing material on here does lend credence to that notion. The lone exceptions to the mixture of slower ideas is the lightning bolt opener \u201cBlackened\u201d, which functions as a better version of \u201cBattery\u201d by exchanging the overlong acoustic drone for a fade in approach with a much less repetitive melody, and the even more agitated closer \u201cDyer\u2019s Eve\u201d, which outclasses everything on \u201cPuppets\u201d and even challenges some of the more orthodox thrashers from the early days. Between the speedy drums, agitated riff work and Hetfield\u2019s still gritty and powerful growl, everything works perfectly and pays credence that brevity is usually the preferred course in this sub-genre.\n\nWhen taking into account the massive flaws in how this album is often perceived, which is usually the result of not exploring other bands in this style, the most important question shouldn\u2019t be ignored, namely \u201cIs this a good album?\u201d The answer to that question is mostly yes; though it could have been a good deal better had \u2018Harvester Of Sorrow\u201d been dropped along with about 10 minutes of purposeless repetition. There are plenty of decent albums out there that utterly downplay the bass and still come off as ingenious, and there are slower Thrash albums that work very well (\u201cSouth Of Heaven\u201d and \u201cSouls Of Black\u201d). But given its massive notoriety, \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d isn\u2019t an album to be recommended so much as to simply be critiqued.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 2, 2011.\n",
        "\nIt has been pretty well established that Metallica lives in the past when on tour, and now they\u2019ve made this fact even more abundantly clear to the blokes over in Australia and New Zealand who\u2019ve been following them since the 80s. Released as something of a precursor to the second part of two tour EP releases to commemorate their 2010 tour of said region, \u201cSix Feet Down Under\u201d is something of a brief chronology of 4 very different eras that the band went through from when they first came to fame and the land of kangaroos and cacti. And like all 4 eras, this thing is about as inconsistent as Charlie Sheen\u2019s command of reality.\n\nThe first half of this is where most of the high points are, save perhaps the production, which is forgivable in a band that is playing thrash metal. The two \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d songs are played in a 100% faithful fashion, right down to the super trebly guitar sound, and barring a tape recorder in the crowd balance of music and crowd noise, is just as good as the studio version. The 2 representatives from \u201cThe Black Album\u201d are fairly consistent, although Hetfield\u2019s vocals are definitely getting too squeaky clean. There\u2019s a nice bit of acoustic soloing in something along the lines of a flamenco guitar sound leading up to \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d, a staple of their tours in the early 90s.\n\nIf consisting only of the previously mentioned songs, this would have been a nice little rarity EP in the live venue, but sadly we have to be reminded of those days when Metallica realized that playing metal wasn\u2019t going to get Lars his 18 karat gold Jacuzzi. The \u201cReload\u201d material is well produced, but that\u2019s basically all its got going for it, apart from the fact that \u201cLow Man\u2019s Lyric\u201d might work well as a comical country song if James\u2019 vocals didn\u2019t blow so much. And worse still, when the last two songs come in from the 2004 touring days, memories of the total abortion that was \u201cSt. Anger\u201d resurface. \u201cFrantic\u201d is a no-brainer in terms of avoidable songs, though somehow the band manages to sound a little less high school band like and the guitars actually have some punch to it. But the highlight is the really weak rendition of \u201cFight Fire With Fire\u201d, showcasing a gutted vocalist struggling through one of the easiest to sing thrash metal songs of the 80s, and a hack drummer showing his true colors as he struggles to keep the beat.\n\nFor those living outside of Australia, there\u2019s not really a whole lot of appeal here, and the same goes for anyone who wants to avoid this band\u2019s post 1995 material. The importation costs alone surpass any value that this has as a rarity for completists and other treasure seekers. Metallica is all but a dead band now, and sadly no one has had the common decency to bury the poor bastards. Absent a biblical resurrection scenario, the past is the place to be with this band.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m opposed to Metallica on this one. And no, I\u2019m not talking about the greenie environmental garbage and other assorted left-wing political nonsense that is being pushed at this event. Though I was a bit chuckled at the irony that oil speculator and laughing stock Al Gore hosted this joke and accepted sponsorship from Dow Chemical, whose ownership of Union Carbide has a direct connection to some notorious water poisoning incidents. This isn\u2019t about being revolted by useful idiots who can\u2019t be bothered to research who\u2019s paying the bills before trying to make a pointless political statement that will be quickly forgotten. This is about a band that, in the process of whoring themselves at every live venue under the sun and riding the coattails of their past accomplishments of more than a decade ago, put on one of the most piss poor performances I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nIt\u2019s generally an accepted premise that when playing to a crowd of non-metal oriented hipsters who are used to recycled 60s and 70s revivalism ala White Stripes aren\u2019t going to go for thrash metal, so hearing 3 of Metallica\u2019s most radio friendly songs off their multi-platinum commercial venture \u201cThe Black Album\u201d was to be expected. Nevertheless, even straight line fanfare can be pulled off with some energy, and that\u2019s where things really fall apart. James Hetfield\u2019s voice is all over the place, there are times when he is barely audible and other times where he\u2019s obnoxiously loud, begging the question of when it was that he forgot how to position himself at the microphone. His high range comes through at about half volume, and his lower range which tries at being rough and aggressive, is utterly sloppy. Likewise, the rest of the band sounds sluggish at best, particularly Lars.\n\nThe real deal breaker and ultimate reason why this was not merely a jest, but an utterly painful one to boot, is the weak sound of the collective whole. I distinctly remember these songs sounding heavy as an anvil when they were first offered up in the live setting throughout the 90s, even after the wretched \u201cLoad\u201d albums. The guitar sound is about as mushy and watery as it was on said late 90s hard rock albums, the bass is a non-factor, and the drums have that same annoying popping tendency that ended up taking the wind out of the already shredded sails of \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d a year later. This doesn\u2019t really even sound like Metallica, but more akin to a 5th rate high school aged tribute band at a relative\u2019s birthday party, save a much bigger audience that is equally as unresponsive as the former.\n\nMasochists would be well advised to stick to the medieval torture chambers where the pains are minor by comparison, but for the extreme ones who want something on par with the threshold of hell, don\u2019t endorse this with your money. A simple trip to Metallica\u2019s youtube page will give you not only the audio, but visual version of this monstrosity to gouge your eyes out to. Likewise, political activists who support the cause are recommended to just go to Kevin Wall and Al Gore in person, and hand them the money along with the typical verbal hero worship and ass-kissing that cynical realists like myself can\u2019t be bothered with. As long as this sort of drivel isn\u2019t being encouraged economically, there may be hope that it never happens again.\n",
        "\nThis is the song that gave Metallica the MTV exposure they desperately needed especially after churning out three quality albums of pure adrenalin. The low budget black and white video not only got heavily played but also brought the band within striking distance of achieving mainstream success. Being a part of the big 4 cadre of thrash, Metallica had do something big to maintain their pedestal level, especially after losing a gifted bass guitarist post the release of what many consider to be their magnum opus, i.e. Master of Puppets. \n\nMillions of people consider this a defining thrash classic, but my take on it is slightly unforgiving. Agreed, this song has got some great hooks and riffs that keep it going, but I\u2019ve always found something missing here. And no, I\u2019m not referring to the inaudibility of the bass (this argument would just go on and on till eternity). Vocally Hetfield hits the right notes, so no complaints there. My biggest complaint here is that puny Dane behind the drums, Lars Ulrich who somehow just comes across as someone for whom terms such as proficiency and technical execution never seem familiar. For the most part, his fills and the so called progressive tendencies are annoying to the core. The only time he justifies his abilities and surprisingly even includes some double bass thuds are when the band hits top gear in the middle. Take the whole bay area thrash fraternity into consideration he stands nowhere near the likes of Paul Bostaph(Forbidden), Darren Minter(Heathen), Tom Hunting(Exodus) or even the young and ferocious Filipino drum machine Andy Galeon(Death Angel). Aside this, I\u2019ve always found this song running short of lyrical content and all through its seven plus minute length, which in itself is another factor that has showed my indifference towards it.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve pointed out the negatives, the positive aspect here is that the song is still truly thrash metal with a good clean intro, heavy riffs and decent solos. The only reason why I would listen to this track is just for that \u201cDarkness, Imprisoning me\u201d part, easily one of the best things Metallica\u2019s ever put out. If it weren't for those factors, I'd have given this \"One\" a good high rating.\n",
        "\nAfter the success of their much acclaimed \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d followed by the tragedy that struck the band in the form of Cliff Burton\u2019s untimely demise, there were many speculations about how Metallica would fare without the greatness of the bass monster that was Cliff. After having recruited the services of another seasoned and now famous bassist, Jason Newsted from Arizona thrash metallers, Flotsam and Jetsam, they decided to enter the studio to professionally record five covers of bands that have had an unquestionable influence on them. It\u2019s a very well known fact that thrash metal and more specifically the early bay area style derived most of its sound from the evergreen NWOBHM scene of the early eighties and Metallica were undoubtedly one of the first exponents of the scene to successfully blend the riff structures of Brit heavy metal with punkish overtones to give us what is known to the world as the well renowned sub genre of heavy metal called thrash!!\n\n\u201cGarage Days Re-revisited\u201d as the name implies is a compilation of some re recorded tracks that Metallica used to jam out in their fledgling days(possibly when the band was still called Leather Charm) and they\u2019ve done absolute justice. Before the release of the double disc Garage Inc. compilation, this was pretty much a collector\u2019s item that was almost impossible to find at a record store. The production on this is crunchy and is better by leaps and bounds compared to the follow up \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d, the latter, although rich in songwriting and musicianship, drawing significant ire from the entire heavy metal fraternity for the bass not being loud enough and almost seemingly absent in the sound mix. Hetfield\u2019s vocals were pretty much in a transition state, sounding slightly different from his vocal work on \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d whereas Ulrich does a steady job behind the drums, despite all the flak he\u2019s continued to receive over the years for having very limited capabilities as a drummer. Kirk Hammett too nails some well timed solos while newbie Jason Newsted\u2019s bass playing abilities are shown here.\n\nAs for the covers, they have been done extremely well and never sound like a mockery of the originals at any given point. \u201cHelpless\u201d is sped up faster with a slight difference in the bridge section as well as the chorus where \u201cHelpless!!!\u201d is not being uttered as many times as in the version by Diamond Head. Next up is the eerie doom/sludge heavy riff monger that sounds almost like the original with an incredible thrash break in the middle. The best track however is the cover of Killing Joke\u2019s \u201cThe Wait\u201d, where the explosive riffs and the synthesized vocals give the track a definite edge over the original. \u201cCrash Course in Brain Surgery\u201d has a good intro bass solo and some good speed metal moments while the penultimate Misfits cover is a holocaust of punk meets thrash with the most sadistic lyrics that only old school hardcore punk bands were capable of concocting.\n\nOverall, a very good covers EP that shows a band ready to get back to its feet after the setback they received a year ago during the Sweden tour. They may have drifted into a rather mainstream territory with the advent of the 90s with a new producer and new ideas, but one can never rule out the fact that Metallica in their heydays were a very dominant force in heavy metal, and a band that many worshipped and to this day consider them one of the biggest influenced. It can be argued that if it wasn\u2019t for them, bay area thrash would never have existed. Since these covers are present on the double disc compilation, as mentioned earlier, it\u2019s advised to check that out just for the magical influences NWOBHM has had on this present day heavy metal legend.\n",
        "\nMuch has been said down the years about the scales that metal, and in particular thrash, rose to but there has been little in the name of collective footage to actually bring to life this fact for all to see. Until now. \"The Big Four: Live From Sofia, Bulgaria\" does exactly what it says on the tin and it does it so well I can hereby classify it as an essential purchase for anyone who a) likes any combination of Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth or Anthrax, b) is curious to see why these bands got so popular and c) like to have quality metal DVDs to stick on at a party. Clocking it at around 6 hours in total the Big Four play more bonafide classics in one performance than is likely to ever be caught on such a release and with a great 45 minute behind-the-scenes documentary capturing the thoughts of the band members on this celebratory occasion last summer it is not lacking in punches to entice the parting of you and your money.\n\nBill-openers for surely the first time in some years, Anthrax plough through the classics their early albums possess in number - \"Caught In A Mosh\", \"I Am The Law\", \"Madhouse\" and \"Antisocial\" among others - with decent, if fairly under-stated, gusto. If you would ask me Testament better deserve to have Anthrax's place in this hallowed club on both past and recent merits, a theory which holds water when looking at the current standards of the bands. Setting a precedence for which Megadeth and Slayer were soon to follow, the vocals of Joey Belladonna lack much of the prowess his 80's wailing held while the quality of Anthrax's 'recent' (8 years and counting now since a studio release) output is upheld by the appearance of just two songs post-1988 included in their 'best of' set (and one, \"Got The Time\" is a cover). To say Anthrax have been treading water for sometime would serve as a major understatement. However as an opening act their stage performance has been honed incalculably over the years to set the mood adequately for the bigger and better acts that were hot on their heels on a balmy summer\u2019s evening in Bulgaria.\n\nAfter years of public and no doubt private squabbles to see Dave Mustaine sharing a stage with his erstwhile Metallica colleagues must register as a very good day in the history of metal. Unfortunately the weather gods decided otherwise as Megadeth's set in Sofia was somewhat tempered the thunderstorm which blew almost from the moment they hit to the stage to leaving it an hour later. As the strongest candidate for best musician across the four bands Mustaine needs no introduction and his honour is held in the timeless quality of those five songs: \"Holy Wars\", \"Hangar 18\", \"Sweating Bullets\", \"Symphony Of Destruction\" and \"Peace Sells\". Utterly superb. With Dave Ellefson now back as a full-time member and rock solid accompaniment from Chris Broderick and Shawn Drover this is as strong a line-up seen in Megadeth for some years and is recognised in the quality reproduction of all 12 songs played. Whether due to sound problems or general decline with age Mustaine's vocals unfortunately feel weak at times across the set while the rain does it's best to dampen the spirited throngs before them but more is required to hold back a band like Megadeth, whose recent resurgence cannot have gone unnoticed by many.\n\nEasily the act who stuck closest to their guns through the 90's wilderness years Slayer remain, and forever will do, a religion to many of their devoted fans; a religion however that is beginning to look as flaky as some of those absconded in these legends lyrical past. With Tom Araya's vocals lacking all the menace of their classic period and a back injury preventing headbanging or any serious movement from him, Jeff Hanneman apparently adhering to the American cheeseburger diet and his and Kerry King's soloing sounding amateur when in competition with Mustaine, Broderick and Hammett, Slayer have, to these jaded ears, lost so much of what defined their untouchable brilliance of the 80s as to be heavily reliant on the continued brilliance of Dave Lombardo behind the kit. No doubt first-time listeners will continue to be blown away by the destructive power of \"Angel Of Death\", \"Reign In Blood\" et al as I was 10 years ago but having seen it all live many a time from a leaner, fitter Slayer it's hard to subscribe to the devotion many others seem intent on showing. Without having had to stand all day however to catch the multiple classics that a Slayer show is rammed full of their current status is better served as home viewing for this particular set of veterans show why they were only the second biggest band to emerge from the thrash scene\u2026\n\nHowever there can only be one winner in this contest and whom that is can leave no doubt. Metallica are, with good reason if \"The Big Four\" is anything to go by, one of the biggest live draws in all of music today and such a set as played here explains why - even before considering the 'Big Four Jam' cover of Diamond Head's classic \"Am I Evil?\". Spreading their setlist right across their classic first five albums with a small handful from 2008's return to form \"Death Magnetic\" highlights emerge from all songs, notably in my personal favourite \"One\" with its accompanying firework and pryo explosions setting the tone for that grimmest of lyrical subjects. Utilising every inch of the stage to it's full potential messrs. Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett and Trujillo give their typical studious best through classic after classic until the Big Four big event happens: a multi-band jam of \"Am I Evil?\" that resonates through the ages \u2013 cult NWoBHM classic transported to a modern-day stadium anthem, with passion throughout. Needless to say the crowd reaction is enthralling and if any further confirmation was needed, a glorious celebration of the power, and history, of these four bands and with it, heavy metal. A celebratory peak of a great genre as it now reaches into its fourth decade of existence: a true story of gritty perseverance getting it\u2019s just deserves.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nNot a bad little tour EP here; pretty cheap ($12 at JB- may not sound that cheap but here that's either a very, very cheap full length or a single), and a bunch of songs that will make most Metallica diehards very interested. Frantic? Eye of the Beholder? Low Man's Lyric?? Yeah, not really a casual fan's release, this- but for the Metallica tragic out there the lack of Sandman, NEM, MoP etc. certainly won't be a minus. \n\nRecording quality is a bit over the place; Fight Fire With Fire and Frantic sound great, Through The Never's quiet, full of noise and has a general \"dude out in the seats with a little tape & mic\" vibe, AJFA even moreso, trebly and tinny to the point that, well, it even makes the original sound good! Still, rough recording was one of the reasons that Cliff 'Em All was so good; and it is nice to hear these tunes done in a live version that's rough and raw, not polished, not overdubbed later on, not auto tuned and quantised.\n\nSongs are similarly inconsistent and a bit rough. Low Man's Lyric has always been a favourite of mine but stripped of the Bob Rock magic sounds fairly flat live- a problem that Unforgiven also suffers with. FFWF is tight and brilliant, short of a few mistakes in the dual lead, although to me the main surprise/highlight is Frantic. Sure, the 'Keep on Searching' and the infamous 'tick tick tick tock' bit will always be pretty lame, but the rest of the song works, and works well, fast, heavy, energetic, surprisingly unshit. \n\nSo, to summarise, this is a bit all over the place but has enough strangeness to be well worthwhile for the big Metallica fan, especially if you saw them on their (excellent) recent antipode tour. For fans only, but most people who've read this review will have guessed that by now, I imagine...\n",
        "\nEven though this album was the starting point of Metallica's commercial success and musical style change from their faster paced thrash metal style to a slower heavy metal style, I was still scratching my head at times wondering why this had some really harsh criticism. Then again, not many people like it when a fellow metal band supposedly changes their musical style to go mainstream. Though I definitely had different feelings about it, the tracks 1 to 5 can be listened to forever so for the beginning I was a totally satisfied. Though how was I satisfied, allow me to dive into the details.\n\nThis is one of Metallica's most legendary and most successful albums, maybe because of the commercial success that helped but please, way back when this came out there were a good amount of music stores that had 200+ people waiting for it to open. You got to bet that was no simple coincidence. Not to mention on its first few months in the stores it was hitting a 1 million, then 2 million, then like the 4 million mark all within about one month each time. \n\nBut other than commercial success shit, as far as the overall performance of everyone\u2019s part really can\u2019t really get any better. Usually the guitar parts for me are the best for any album, but here it was the lyrics. I mean look at these:\n\nSay your prayers little one \ndon't forget, my son \nto include everyone \n\nI tuck you in, warm within \nkeep you free from sin \ntill the sandman he comes \n\nHow can you not like that? Easily one of their most thought lyrical albums; it just can\u2019t get any better. The guitars were simple yet still great and heavy; Kirk's mind is infinite in solos and riffs. James's rhythm guitar part was just as good, his vocals were sweet as well. Lars despite the shit I may get is actually a great drummer. And Jason is almost better than Cliff, shame he doesn't get too many moments. Everyone was at their peaks here which really helps. But a further dive into performance we shall go.\n\nAs far as James and his vocals went, he really has a harsh voice, and if he wants it to sound nice and soft and mellow, he can do that too. He has a great versatility in his voice and uses so many different moods in his voice in different songs, such as one song he's screaming his ass off and the next song he's nice and mellow. His voice and versatility of it along with the fucking kick ass lyrics make the vocal category of this album blow literally everything else into the weeds pretty much. As far as Kirk and James's guitar parts, I really have to say the second best part. Like I said, Kirk's mind is infinite with writing riffs and solos, and James is very capable to back those up with some very nice rhythm guitar parts. The guitars are definitely a highlight here and definitely contain some of Metallica's most famous riffs such as the Enter Sandman riff. Lars can definitely drum. He's not some Danish idiot who bangs everything on a drum set like a six-year old. Lars has his moments such as some very brief little drum solos, most of which can be found on the tracks Sad but True and Wherever I May Roam. They are very nice and I can say will take the third best part. As far as their bass lines go, well, Jason definitely was no fluke and had some awesome bass lines; the only problem is their one step away from not being heard. Yes he did have some little short bass solos such as on Enter Sandman but after that, really all of Jason's good work sort of gets thrown in the recycling bin. I'm not saying the bass was bad; they were actually good though probably the worst part here.\n\nThe best track on the entire album to me was Sad but True. Really fucking heavy song and probably heaviest song on the entire album. Though really all the tracks 1 through 5 were the best and make me not feel like skipping any tracks you really don't have to dig for a good song because they're right there when the thing starts playing. Although, I guess I could say Don\u2019t Tread on Me and Of Wolf and Man were satisfactory, but they really seem to require some real motivation to listen to until the end and are forgettable. Though after track 5, everything is really sort of forgettable except on Nothing Else Matters, it makes it so like after Wherever I May Roam, I just want to skip down to Nothing Else Matters and the rest of the tracks are forgettable except their little remixed Star Wars Imperial March was absolutely awesome as well, and that is coming from a Star Wars fan myself, I know how it goes and I really wish they put Metallica's version in the movies.\n\nSo there we have it, probably Metallica's third best album, but considering this is not rated 100%, you bet I had some problems with it. Like I said before, everything after Wherever I May Roam with the exception of Nothing Else Matters and the Star Wars Imperial March are very forgettable and while some these tracks may be satisfactory still require much motivation to listen to until the end. Second, not like song lengths are a big deal, but they could be kept as balanced as possible, again not a big deal, but something that could help make a good album an even better album. Third, does Jason even play here? Or did you give him his one moment in Enter Sandman and throw him out the window the rest of the time?\n\nSo that wraps up the Black Album, otherwise known as Metallica. And I say this is really worth a buy or an iTunes buy, it doesn't really matter how, just listen to it somehow.\n",
        "\nIt's so easy to hate The Black Album. It was the fatal stroke, the stake to the heart, the last passably listenable Metallica release. At the time it was needed, Metallica's brand of ever escalating thrash had overstuffed itself with And Justice For All and The Black Album served as a necessary palate cleanser. So I understand the reset but I cannot forgive what they did with it. The success of this record went to their heads. It ruined them and hindsight makes it all the more difficult to sift out the value of this recording in any sort of objective manner because it is so shrouded in thickening emotion and with Metallica still around rubbing our faces in their continually descending mediocrity, well, it makes it all the more difficult.\n\nThat The Black Album is seminal is indisputable. Personal feelings aside, it was a landmark in heavy metal, one of the high-selling records of all-time. It captured a zeitgeist so effectively that it remains for many the most important album of their lives, whether they still listen to it or not, whether they even care to admit it. The Black Album brought legions into metal (for better or worse, worse mostly I'm afraid). In terms of legitimizing metal, still a mostly underground phenomenon, with the mainstream, it is as important a record as Black Sabbath's Paranoid and AC/DC's Back In Black, though musically it pales in comparison to both.\n\nWhat Metallica had achieved in the trajectory from Kill 'Em All to And Justice For All is simply amazing and had they split up afterward, their legacy would still stand untarnished. Even with the indelible stain of the last twenty years hanging over them, those first four records remain among the best metal albums ever recorded. And The Black Album killed that momentum completely. \n\nThis record is big, loud, and dumb -- much like the generation of mainstream arena rock fans who would embrace it. Musically, it is derivative of other bands with simpler formats, seeking radio friendly, accessible hits that, while retaining their previous heaviness, sacrificed much of their intensity and complexity. That a few of these songs are actually quite catchy is unsurprising given their resulting popularity but even the best songs on The Black Album are mostly mediocre.\n\nOpener \"Enter Sandman\" pretty much tells the tale. The clean opening is ominous and intriguing, as the bass and drums enter, you feel an epic in the making. The songs starts to swirl as the tension builds and builds, you await the blasting speed but are met instead with an insufferably derivative mid-tempo riff that goes nowhere. The song goes verse-chorus-verse-chorus in a fairly standard way until Kirk kicks out a decent solo (his solos throughout are generally excellent) and then James goes into a weird spoken word segue that is suitably creepy but by then the song has lost my goodwill. \n\n\"Sad But True\" has a decent little headbanger of a riff but it never changes once throughout the duration of the songs five-and-a-half minutes and I'm asleep before it's over. Take this riff, use it as a bridge in a faster song, a stop-gap headbanging breather, and it would be awesome but as the singular focus of a song, it drags.\n\nThe pattern rarely varies: \"Wherever I May Roam\" has some decent ideas but is again too simplistic to really hold my attention; \"Holier Than Thou\" is lukewarm thrash that fails because you can tell their hearts aren't in it; ditto \"The Struggle Within,\" which sounds like an AJFA b-side that was wisely left on the cutting room floor. And these are among the album's better more metal numbers.\n\nThe only songs that hold up on here for me, that I can hold out as true and worthy Metallica songs, are the ballads \"Unforgiven\" and \"Nothing Else Matters.\" The latter is an epic ballad in the tradition of \"Fade To Black.\" It is brilliantly and sensitively constructed, possessing multiple layers of composition and performance, and yet quite moving in it's lyrical sentiment. The former is mid-paced perfection, with it's rolling intro, creepy atmospherics, and blazing solos. These songs would not have been out of place on any of their previous three albums and as an overall direction for the band would've been more fruitful than the dreadful arena rockers they stuffed this record with.\n\nCredit where credit is due, this album sounds amazing. Bob Rock gave them the sound they wanted. The guitars are huge, razor sharp yet full-bodied. Jason's bass is audible (I'm sure to his relief). The drums are slightly overpowering and harsh in the mix but pumped at the mega-decibels needed for outdoor arenas, it's perfect. I can't grudge them their choice, though I wish they'd dumped him again after this record.\n\nIn the end, The Black Album is fairly execrable. I could forgive it were it but a blip on the radar. But it wasn't. It presaged doom not just for Metallica but for metal in general. For The Black Album's legacy taints Megadeth as well (Countdown To Extinction may be a better attempt at a Black Album but it still started them on their downward slide as well). And then there were the hordes of slavish imitators who chucked their hard work in favor of easy hits. As successful as this record was, Metallica has never really recovered from it. They tried to fruitlessly duplicate its success for awhile then have more recently scrambled to reclaim their previous legacy. None of it has worked. The monetary blessings of The Black Album were Metallica's artistic curse and that is this record's true legacy.\n",
        "\nAll Nightmare Long is the best song off the new Metallica by a long way and I wish they'd released this song first, as opposed to the first two tracks we had the pleasure of hearing (Cyanide shouldn't even exist.. why play it live first?). Whereas most of the album succeeds at a certain extent in bringing back \"the old days\" and all that shit, this song iny my not-very-humble-opinion is a genuine Metallica classic that can hang around with the best songs they've ever done.\n\nIt's in the long thrash style but perhaps a bit more fierce then anything of that ilk off Justice. Key changes, a really, really nice solo section complete with one of the best riffs Metallica (and thus by extention, everyone) has ever done, a very satisfying chorus, main riff and false ending. It's long but whatever, it's a really good song. By far the best song they've done since AJFA. Probably some of James's best lyrical content off the new release as well.\n\nIn my version the other songs are Blackened and Seek and Destroy. Competent enough live versions, I guess; James's fairly high current voice works fairly well other the first one, which will always be a favourite song of mine; meanwhile, S&D is a boring, pointless slog, always has been, always will be. Nothing new there.\n\nWorth owning? Not really, but I'd say if you find it cheap and haven't heard the new album yet then you'd be well off giving it a listen. In general the new-y has it's dips and troughs, but it also has it's peaks. ANL is a really, really good song. It's that simple.\n\n\nPostscript: I don't have the DVD version of this, but i'd definitely recommend youtubing the video. It's a bit of an unusual one for Metallica, no band footage, just a strange, old-horror inspired \"documentary\" that's good watching and fits the song nicely.\n",
        "\nAs a fairly big fanboy of Metallica, over the last however many years I tend to idly check on how they're going in the live format; download an mp3 or two or, with all those new fangled internet speeds, hit the youtubes and see how it's all going. From what I can tell, there was a pretty low point around 03-06 or so, but the new material's got them back to a quality that's probably akin to the Cunning Stunts era. Hetfield's voice varies from show to show and he needs to stop ruining the Fade to Black outro, Lars needs to practise a bit more, well, they're hardly new problems. 'Course, it's hard to judge by a big, speccy production like this as to where they're at live. Based on a different recorded version of this show that I downloaded, Hetfield had a good night, thus making the autotune a bit unnecessary, but the drum quantitizing was well needed. Who knows how much studio trickery was involved, though.\n\nRegardless, the new songs and Dyer's Eve are a definite highlight on here. I've always figured that Metallica must get completely sick of having to play Puppets, Fade to Black, One, the usual stuff, year after year and gig after gig, and while the classics are all delivered competently (it's hard to ruin such great songs) the band seems to have a much better time playing stuff that they haven't completely hammered into the ground.\n\nThat's a pretty accurate description of this DVD, really; just watch all the less-played cuts and forget the rest. All Nightmare Long and Broken, Beat & Scarred off the new one are particular standouts; the former doesn't suffer at all from being played straight after One, and the band really throw themselves at BBS. Dyer's is probably the peak here; I've always considered the solo section to be one of Metallica's finest moments; a strangely beautiful, soaring instrumental break and here it's in full glory, Hammett makes a few mistakes but overall it's still some of the finest music you'll ever hear. \n\nSome truly fantastic moments aside, there's the usual \"off to the bar\" moments. I definitely reckon the average Metallica show would improve tenfold were they to cut a few songs off the damn set list too. Nothing Else Matters has never worked too well live without the extra guitars, strings and Bob Rock trickery, here's no exception. Seek and Destroy is about as anticlimatic a closer as you can get. Day that Never Comes? How'd that even get on the new album? Cut half an hour off, and put FFWF and Battery in. It's not rocket science.. And does Sandman really need to be played? Most people who go to see Metallica these days are going to be fans of all the stuff, so it wouldn't hurt resting it for a change. Oh well. While I'm bitching, there is no excuse for cutting off the tail off the Blackened solo! None whatsoever. Aaaaargh. \n\nYeah, there's some filler and a bit of fat could be trimmed off but I still thoroughly enjoyed this whole thing. Lars' habit of speeding up randomly through songs actually works rather well in MoP, Dyer's is one of the best Metallica songs, the new stuff works well, it's all relatively tight and Hetfield will always have an amazing stage presence. Being an extremely expensive production, the direction, camera angles etc. is faultless. Opening with Blackened and Creeping Death back to back is a pretty conclusive way of saying \"We have the best back catalogue in the world\". To be honest, you probably already knew whether you were going to buy this or not, but for those on the fence I definitely recommend you do. It's Metallica on a good night, playing a good set, with it captured extremely well.\n\nPostscript: The interviews and stuff were also pretty good, but I see that as pretty unimportant in the context of a concert film, thus I didn't mention them\n",
        "\nSeems that Metallica must've really enjoyed making the video of One, because once that happened the floodgates opened. They've made four (four!!) videos per album since and assuming there's another Death Magnetic single that trend will continue for a while yet. A video coItllection was always inevitable; although it's a bit of a shame that they didn't wait for another album; considering some of the Death Magnetic being their best video material for some time.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to work out that most of the songs on here are going to be somewhat bad. None of the truly interesting songs on the Loads are represented here, neither the more interesting Garage Inc. covers (why wasn't there an Astronomy single?), with the whole thing rounded out by a bunch of really bad St.Anger radio edits which seem to cut out the songs' better parts with admirable consistency.\n\nIt's strange that despite how blalantly commercial (or at least accessible) most of the songs on here are, most of the videos are actually pretty good. From the \"jason smearing goo on himself\" in Until it Sleeps, to the rather depressing Turn the Page video wherein a prostitute gets raped in front of her kid, to the excellent St.Anger video; it all looks pretty damn good and has a streak of artistry that the songs themselves lacked somewhat. Memory Remains is a stand out for me; nostalgia value aside (the videoclip was the first metal song I heard, and subsequently got me into the whole genre) it's a great video clip and a pretty cool song; the revolving room telling of the heady ups and downs of stardom and is just a damn cool effect all round. Not surprising, but the production values are amazing and there's no expense spared.\n\nThe downside to the whole thing is generally the videos for the Black Album. The long, experimental and completely left-of-field uncut Unforgiven version aside (a real oddity for a massive band to do something this unusual) it's all rather boring and rock star-ish; getting all sensitive in the studio to Nothing Else Matters, rocking out to the crowd with Sad But True and Wherever I may Roam. Perhaps using videos as a way to chart a band's integrity isn't quite right; regardless the videos here definitely suggest the band lost it's way for a few years.\n\nStating the obvious here but you've got to be quite a Metallica fan to watch this; very little of the golden era is represented. Decent value for money, seeing as it comes with Two of One as well. It's a shame they didn't start making videos earlier, that's all.\n",
        "\n....And justice for all had it's share of controversies, The death of cliff burton, The entry of the 'invisible kid', Jason newsted who was basically absent in the production of Justice. Metallica were heavily criticized for the production and the sheer length of the album, I can understand the criticisms regarding production but many half-balled metalheads couldn't stay awake for an hour. \n\nHarvester of sorrow is almost a doom metal track, The track personifies many Sabbath-ish influences and adds a super-charged thrash metal kick to it. This was truly how metallica should've stayed after their first four albums. Personally, I think this is Lars's best drumming performance. The intro is extremely original, The guitars and the drums are in perfect harmony to create a very heavy thick intro. The build up to the main riff has a hauntingly melodic atmosphere to it. As soon as the main riff kicks in, You can't help but bang your head until it bleeds. The slow but irresistably heavy riff makes this one of the most original songs ever. Just watch the live performance back at 'Monsters of rock 91'.\n\n4:10 - 4:42 is just pure mayhem, The awkward 'pause and resume' feel of the drums and guitars, Just promises to make your head and neck sore. The biggest strong point on this song is the lyrics, The vocal delivery and the conviction behind them. This was the last time hetfield really sounded his raw best before mellowing out on 'Load' and 'Reload'. Kirk's eerie solo in the song is one of my favorite solos and sounds like impending doom is to follow and remind me a lot of sabbath's stuff.\n\nThis is one of my personal favorite songs, The pummeling synchronization of the drums and the sharp guitars make this one of the heaviest songs of all time. The other songs on this single are 'Breadfan', Which is a very interesting cover of an old school song. This is arguably their best cover song, They transformed the track into a thrash metal monster of sorts in the middle section after the initial lyrics and riffs end. The cover of diamond head's The Prince' is a mixed bag, The riffs and the drumming no doubt sound better but hetfield's singing is not too bad, His vocal delivery in and around the 'singing' parts isn't that good. But it's still a honest cover of one of their biggest influences.\n\nIf you feel that '....And Justice For All' is a little too long and depressing for your tastes, Get this single, Which is arguably the best song on the album, Considering it clocks in at less than 6 minutes in length. If you really enjoy sabbath, Metallica or just really heavy stuff, You will not be disappointed by 'Harvester of Sorrow'.\n",
        "\nMetallica's career is the official roller-coaster experience in the history of metal, no matter how you look at it. Denying their important part in the formative years of thrash is silliness, no matter how influental you consider Mustaine's contributions, and no matter how much you disagree with him being given the boot. Kill 'em All is one of the handful of original thrash full-lengths, even if someone somewhere might have done something similar before. Ride the Lightning, along with the commercial behemoth Master of Puppets, defined the frontier between thrash and mainstream on the map of music, with MoP sometimes slipping over to the other side. The S/T black album was a carefully planned commercial success, and the Loads were the next, logical step in the mid-life mellowing of millionaires. St Anger is the album they'd disown, weren't they too embarrassed of it to discuss it enough to disown it. But where does ...And Justice for All fit in this stomach-churning series of ups and downs?\n\n...And Justice for All should have been the album that killed Metallica. And to emphasize, it could have been exactly that, looking from a musical/financial angle, it should have been exactly that, looking from the tr00 metalhead's angle, and it might even have turned into that, had the audience and the band listened to critics and each other more than they did. Also, it's perhaps the \"forgotten\" Metallica album, after the waves it made upon its release died and the albums that came after it left it wedged between the thrashy beginning and the commercially successful section of Metallica's long career.\n\nThe music on ...And Justice for All is curiously something thrash could have evolved into in its mature years. As such, it could perhaps be seen as a manifesto, an attempted new beginning for a genre that burned the candle from both ends and virtually disappeared for a decade after shining so very brightly. The songs have a progressive feel to them, but without any real progressive elements; considering long songs a telltale sign of \"progression\" has always been a shining example of faulty logic. Here, the scent of progressive influence stems more from the chosen sound, the controversial clinical production, and the fact that they gave up the last remnants of their original fury and replaced it with a taste of cold steel and controlled restraint, but didn't yet inject any of the radio-friendly components of the later albums.\n\nThe songs have a nice variance between them, from the thrash pieces such as \"Blackened\", to slower but almost as uncompromizing songs such as \"Harvester of Sorrow\". The underlying template from Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets found its way onto ...And Justice for All, and \"One\" holds the position of the song that turns from a mellow thing to more angry metal stealthily as a ninja in the night, reserved by \"Fade to Black\" and \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" on the earlier albums as the last song of the first side of the vinyl version; the albums were a product of the days of staggeringly expensive CDs, and the gatefold vinyl version was one of the neatest formats of metal albums ever. The song placement follows the same pattern on other tracks as well. \n\nThe controversy of the production led to some heated discussion back in the day, even before the popularization of internet allowed Joe Sixpack to voice his opinion, followed by a muffled \"durr....\". The drums have a neutered cardboard box sound, especially compared to the fleshy cudgeling on most 80s thrash albums. Unlike MoP, the album didn't get rest of the world onto the bandwagon, and very few albums emulate the sound of ...AJfA. The problems in the production are difficult to point out, and even the bass frequencies, often mentioned as missing, are there. The overall sound resembles a bread knife more than the earlier baseball bat, and has a thin, serrated feel to it. Why didn't it work? That's a good question, because the guitars on the front have a sharp edge, the drumming is perfectly audible despite the odd choice of sound, and even Hetfield's last decent vocals are fully audible, if a bit distant. Somehow the production robs a big part of the punch the songs could have held, but on the other hand, it is the origin of the \"progressive\" tag too often glued on the album.\n\nTechnically, the performance is rather good, and almost mechanical in its perfection; it gives the music a robotic, soulless exterior, and distancing the vocals to the background and giving the sharp guitars the main role further turns this into the least readily accessible Metallica album. No doubt Ulrich's drums have been doctored, and Hammett's solos were finally starting to get too stale to really work on this kind of metal, but the album is a rhythm guitar driven creation, and the things that stay in the mind's player are the riffs. And there is a bunch of really good riffs on the album. It just takes a dozen spins before the box opens, the production makes ...AJfA a difficult thing to approach.\n\nBut what about the part about ...And Justice for All being the death of Metallica alluded to earlier? What makes this album so potentially lethal to the band? The answer comes in three parts, just like the question.\n\nThe album could have killed off Metallica, and it sort of did, because after it Metallica wasn't the Metallica of the earlier albums, and promptly \"sold out\" on the black album immediately a couple of years afterwards. After the surprising success of Master of Puppets, Metallica was one of the metal bands most closely followed by music media, if not the metal band. And media didn't like ...And Justice for All. The critics bashed the production, the radio played the songs less than those of MoP two years earlier, and a lot of people who recognized several of the songs off MoP never learned to know a single track from this album, until Metallica gave in on their \"no videos\" policy and shot a music video for \"One\". The video is a child of its times, and a decent thing at that, with the Johnny Got His Gun clips, even including the coversations from the movie on top of the music, and unheard of thing back in the late 80s. Only the appearance of the video made this album known among the mainstream crowd, and \"One\" remains the only track with any household value here. Yes, this could well have ended the career of Metallica, but the days of hundreds of millions of people online, all willing to voice their informed opinions and jump the bandwagon, were still far ahead. Should this kind of release see the light of day now, it would get beaten to pulp before release date by the downloading masses, and it would be guaranteed to fail commercially. This time, however, the fans were loyal to the band, and ...And Justice for All didn't kill Metallica. They learned from the experience, though, and instead of an ambitious metal album, they created a commercial album with radio tracks and several accompanying videos next. \n\nTo say that the album should have killed Metallica is a more opinionated claim. The aforementioned selling out on the black album was the point where an old school Metallica fan's interest in the band started to wane, and the development reached its nadir on Load and even more acutely on Reload. Had we never seen the days of radio-friendly Metallica, the modern rock phase of the Loads, or the pseudo-symphonic foolishness of S&M, not to mention the desperate throwback abomination known as St. Anger, and had Metallica known better and disbanded after ...And Justice for All, they'd hold much more credibility among the metal audience. Naturally, their bank accounts would also hold at least one digit less, but this album could well have held the same position as, say, Emotional Playground in Stone's discography, as the difficult to access but rewarding final album in a beautiful run of a handful of quality metal. Instead, they kept going, made a shitload of money, turned into a stadion dinosaur with surprisingly good live shows, had a midlife crisis known as St. Anger, made a \"return to the roots\" on Death Magnetic and so on. Things could have gone a different way, and Metallica could have left a beautiful corpse instead of the Grandpa Simpson of today.\n\nFinally, ...And Justice for All might have been the death of Metallica. The album indeed wasn't loved by the media, except, of course, by the corporate metal magazines. A group with less drive and ideas, or, alternatively put, less bony foreheads and stubborness, could well have seen the reception of the album as a coup de gr\u00e2ce, and maybe even seen the looming end of the wonderful thrash era ahead, and dropped their instruments there and then. But Metallica turned the knobs titled \"commercial\" on their amps to eleven, and started to walk the road of transformation to AOR. More so, had the audience listened to the media and each other as much as it does today, and the decision might not even have been theirs to make. This may sound tautological with the above, but things are different from the band's and the audience's points of view.\n\nIf Metallica indeed has an album that could be called \"forgotten\", this is it. No radio hits or well-known songs beyond \"One\", no real controversy after the first year's discussion on the production died down, and few people with strong opinions on it, ...And Justice for All gets less mentions than the albums both preceding and following it virtually everywhere. The low accessibility, combined with the production and the last ambitious examples of Metallica's songwriting make this the album with no obvious target audience. No target audience translates to little discussion, and that's the extent of it. \n\n...And Justice for All is a good album. It has its flaws, but the songs simply beg for cover versions, to show their real potential. There are bucketfuls of good riffs, the songs work like oiled machines, and for the last time before compromizing, Metallica plays real thrash. There are those of us who took the time to get used to the album, and consider it better than MoP, but even we sometimes forget it on the CD shelf for half a decade. Returning to it is always a delight, though, once the effort of getting the door to its soul open is taken. Don't give up, there are nuggets of gold among the rust-coloured sand here.\n",
        "\nThe biggest difference in this set of DVDs is just how loud Metallica were back in those days, 1986-1992, Metallica were at the peak of their live performances, Within this box set, you will find 5 hours of the loudest metal you can hear since Motorhead in their prime. The crowd participation is unlike most other concerts, Metallica really get the crowd involved. James's Vocals were at their absolute peak. \"Enter Sandman\" and \"Harvester of Sorrow\" sound better than their studio album counterparts. \"Sad but true\" is the loudest and heaviest song they played in the san diego concert. The mix of the heavy black album songs and their classics worked very well. \n\nThe highlights of this album is an 18 minute version of \"Seek and destroy\" as Hetfield looks for someone in the crowd to scream for him, This kind of crowd participation is never found in Metallica concerts of today. \"Battery\" is fast as hell, Lars Ulrich in those days could pull it off. It's amazing how James can sing the lyrics and play the rhythm guitar at the same time for a track like Battery and Whiplash. He is phenomenal. Jason Newsted gets to sing like a maniac in the 91 version of Whiplash, He sounds great, much better than most full time vocalists to be honest. \"Fade to black\" and \"One\" add a lot of atmosphere to them, They sound even better than in the studio version. \n\nThere's a 20 minute solo given to each member of the band, Jason, Kirk, Lars. James and Lars even have a drum battle with each other with James almost winning. They perform covers of \"breadfan\" and \"Am I Evil?\" and they never sounded better. The best part is the Intro for \"Am I Evil?\", which really sounds evil. They perform fan favorites like \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Creeping Death\", further cementing their love for the fans. There are chicks flashing, people head-banging etc, Everything you could possibly hope for in a Live DVD. \n\nAre there any drawbacks?, well, it could just be too loud and too long for the average Metal fan but for enthusiasts, This is one of the best you can ever find. Metal non-stop.\n",
        "\nLet me start by saying that \"King Nothing\" is the best track on the mediocre \"Load\". The track is crushing, reminiscent of Metallica's earlier \"Enter Sandman\". Both songs have a similar structure and style of lyrics writing. The lyrics and vocal style remind me of something made by Motorhead and Lemmy. Hetfield's vocals are commanding as he screams \"Then it all crashes down...\". The Lemmy Kilmister influences are heavy here. The instrumentals are heavy and thick, similar to other tracks on this album. The drumming is solid but nothing too technical, just focusing on force. Kirk has a good solo towards the end, probably his best in the forgettable Load era. This is probably Jason Newsted's best performance ever as it is his bass riff which progresses into the main guitar riff. \n\nAt about five and a half minutes in length, this is unlike the other overlong songs on this album. If you like grunge, or just dark hard rock. The King nothing single is certainly worth a buy. This is certainly the best song in Metallica's Load era.\n",
        "\nOne is probably Metallica's most popular song this side of the black album. There was a music video made and this angered a lot of fans. This was the first time Metallica made a music video as it was inevitable. Slayer, Megadeth and anthrax had already done music videos before 1988. But still Metallica get all the criticism in the world.\n\nThe track starts off with the sound of machine gun fire and leads into a beautiful melodic intro. The track is lyrically about a wounded soldier who remembers his days in the warfield. Hetfield's direct approach to writing lyrics delivers all the evils of war seen through a soldier's eyes. The song starts off in a slow manner and gets progressively harsher as the song moves forward. Lars' drumming is at it's absolutely innovative peak here. His efforts here raised the standards of Metal forever. No wonder Ulrich's double bass drumming is so infamous. The so called \"Machine gun riffs\" kick in at about the middle of the song. The aggression is unlike any other Metallica song as Hetfield starts screaming the horrors of the aftermath of war with some of the heaviest and darkest riffs you'll hear in the background. The outro is one of the greatest and most memorable solos of all time, Kirk Hammett never topped this again, or even got close to it. \n\nThis is a permanent fixture in Metallica's live performances and for good reason. The song is aggressive as any other song is, without compromising on the lyrics and atmosphere. This is arguably the best track on the overlong \"...and justice for all\" and arguably one of the greatest Metal songs of all time.\n",
        "\nMetallica\u2019s \u201cS&M\u201d album creates great conflict within me. The protagonistic/antagonistic nature that the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra creates as it paints its sounds on the sonic tapestry known as Metallica is a grand concept. A macroscopic look at this makes it seem like a really great album, but upon a more microscopic analysis of the items at hand raises questions in its integrity and quality. While I can appreciate it and have listened to it optimistically several times, I simply cannot hand out an overtly positive review of this album because it lacks what I believe to be intrinsic things such as its choices of repertoire, orchestration(s), and staff. \n\nUpon first listening to these discs it is quite captivating with \u201cThe Ecstasy of Gold\u201d leading into \u201cThe Call of the Ktulu.\u201d The brass section in \u201cThe Call of the Ktulu\u201d is quite dark and epic sounding and this honestly gave me an Emperor flashback to \u201cIV Equilibrium.\u201d I am sitting here listening to it anticipating the great sounds to come because after all this is Metallica we are talking about and they did play live with a symphony orchestra which is something that the majority of bands in the metal genre cannot claim as a been there done that (Deep Purple, Queensryche, Kiss). \n\nSo let\u2019s talk a bit about orchestration. After reading the liner notes it appears that Michael Kamen is quite proud of his orchestration work (in the small print the liner notes also say that Kamen had a team of people working on the orchestrations). However, it is beyond me how he can compare this work (himself) to Beethoven, Stravinsky, or even more offensively a Wagnerian music drama (ego maybe?). Sorry, but this orchestration does not touch the level of Beethoven, Wagner, or Stravinsky. However, as I listened to this disc it did became apparent that perhaps Kamen was using some sort of leitmotif throughout the duration of the recording and that is a characteristic of Wagnerian style but not in the context of how it is used on this Metallica recording. By this I mean that Wagner used the leitmotif as part of his music dramas to announce the appearance of a character, event, or emotion. In the context of this Metallica CD there are no characters (unless we have to be constantly reminded that Metallica is on the stage) and there is not a story line (to my knowledge, even though the liner notes imply an intangible story line) that connects these songs together in a dramatic fashion as for instance Wagner did in \u201cDer Ring Des Nibelungen.\u201d This evidence will support my premise that the orchestration on this album is boring and redundant. Thus, the orchestration here fell short of my expectations and the true potential that an ambitious project such as this could aspire to be. In my opinion the orchestration is largely weak and unimpressive. Not to mention that the classical and romantic composers would in general frown upon Metallica\u2019s approach to music in the respect that their songs are riddled with parallel fifths. That is something that did not become largely acceptable for composers to use until around the 20th century. The point is that Metallica\u2019s music is not fit stylistically to compare to Beethoven or Wagner and the orchestration(s) did not help to remedy this taboo interval sequence that Metallica frequents (though it could have had the orchestrator(s) changed around the parts Metallica plays). Therefore, the CD is not classical or romantic in style but 20th century at best. \n\nBut what about the metal band that is the main attraction for this circus of sound? Metallica\u2019s playing does appear to be razor sharp. However, I did do some research on this recording before writing this review and found out a couple things that make me question Metallica\u2019s performance here. First, the DVD version offers sound options, \u201cMetallica only\u201d and \u201cOrchestra only.\u201d That is some serious isolation for such a big live performance and hence an opportunity for overdubs? Also, the small print liner notes on the disc say that this was recorded in two days. Maybe they used the Frank Zappa rule of statistics and superimposed parts of different performances (or maybe a performance and a rehearsal) to come up with an excellent recording (cheating in my opinion). Kamen\u2019s liner notes say \u201cafter two evenings of sturm and drang\u201d and then go on to say \u201cafter the evening was over\u201d which is confusing. I was under the impression from some other sources and the photo of the set list on the back of these discs that this performance was recorded live in one night. Overall it does strike me as a good performance on behalf of Metallica. So I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they are able to play their songs flawlessly under any type of condition. BUT, I was kind of lost when I heard James sing \u201cMaster of Puppets Baby\u201d or something to that effect. Come on, I mean that is something I would expect from Stephen Tyler or David Lee Roth not Metallica. Yuck! Bad taste James.\n\nThere is also the could have, should have, and would haves that in effect would have made this album superior. The song selection for starters is a problem. Where is the \u201cKill \u2018em All\u201d track? \u201cSeek and Destroy\u201d and \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d are prime for orchestration. Moreover, \u201cFade to Black,\u201d \u201cOrion,\u201d \u201cTo Live is to Die,\u201d \u201cThe Small Hours,\u201d etc are other songs that should have been on this recording. The tonalities of the orchestration(s) are another big grievance I have with these discs. The orchestrator(s) would have been better off sticking to the chord structures the Metallica songs have already defined without trying to second guess what the orchestrator(s) think that Metallica fans would like to hear woven into the songs or would be moved by if this type of tonality was added here. Furthermore, hire a person into the metal genre to orchestrate your tunes. Why hire someone unknown to metal heads and judging by his liner notes never experienced true metal at all? Had it not been for the metal fans that bought the Metallica albums and merchandise throughout the years would this album have been possible to begin with? The point is, give back to the community. There are several metal heads that have spent time studying orchestration. The first one that comes to my mind is Luc Lemay of Gorguts. Imagine how different this album would be if someone who knows the style(s) intimately and was hungry was given a chance to do something like this.\n\nTheoretically I like this album because I am a fan of both orchestral and metal music(s). A big plus goes to Metallica using a real orchestra and not a synthesizer to record this. However, I am disappointed in Metallica for not making it a literally over the top recording. Just thinking of them as the stereotypical band that can do anything they want to with music because they have what seems to be unlimited resources when compared to other more obscure bands; then why not make an album to be revered and envied? This subsequently falls short of the greatness that could be found under the guise of a hungry band. Thus, this album is only halfway there but can be given a few extra percentage points for some of the pluses I pointed out. This album is certainly an antagonist.\n",
        "\nThe year was 2003. Jason Newsted had left the band. I, like the many other die hard Metallica fans, was disappointed by this. Jason was a great bass player, and it is a shame he never got to show his full potential in Metallica. Listen to the last two Voivod albums to see what I mean. His live backing vocals also gave more power to even the most lack-luster of Metallica songs and he had an amazing stage presence. As soon as Jason jumped ship, I knew this meant trouble, BIG trouble. If this wasn't bad enough, they didn't get a new bass player right away. Instead they had their producer, Bob Rock, play bass, while the band searched for a replacement and trying to record this album. When this disc was released, the album was met with very mixed reviews but since when is this new for Metallica? I had to check it out for myself. \n\nAt first glance, in spite of everything I mentioned above, things looked promising. Updating the logo that hearkened back to the days when they were truly great, plus the positive initial reviews, brought a false sense of security. Was I wrong or what? Now the purpose of what you have read up to this point was to back up the fact that I do not hate Metallica. In all honesty it is very much the opposite. I am a die-hard fan, although not to the point of blind allegiance, and had practically grown up with them. This band was my gateway to metal as a whole. That being said, I really wanted to like this disc. But after listening to \"St. Anger\" all the way through a few times, I could not bring myself to like it, much less tolerate it. Musically, it is not good in any way. It doesn't matter what genre you try to fit it in; it's simply not good. It's not pleasant, thought provoking, exciting, or stimulative of any of the emotions music is supposed to invoke. Any shred of the Metallica of old has been lost completely with \"St.Anger\". This album was not a return to form as promised, but a cheap attempt to get fans who had long abandoned Metallica after the \"Load\" era, to give the band more money and another chance. You can't blame the band for trying, but almost everything about this album is just wrong. The concept behind the album honestly isn't all that bad. \"St. Anger\" for the most part, is an exploration of James Hetfield's inner demons. He was fresh out of rehab, after all. So conceptually the album isn't bad, but musically it's one of the worst things I've ever heard.\n\nMy main complaint is that the songs sound unfinished and production is horrid. My first issue is the songs are lacking guitar solos completely. Kirk actually wrote solos for the songs, but Bob Rock saw that these were totally removed from the final recording. He must have lost his mind. Metallica and scorching guitar solos just go hand in hand. Kirk helped pioneer single note solos, and you knew right away you were listening to Metallica due to the solos alone. Hetfield's vocals, although rougher and angrier (\"Kill em All\" days), are dry, cracking, and sometimes straining. The guitars have no unity or coherence and due to the down tuning just sound muddy. They are also completely buried under the drums at almost all times. The worst part about the production is the now-infamous drums (the snare in particular). Seriously, it sounds like a friggin' trash can lid. Every song on this disc is annihilated by the drums. Drums are not supposed to screw up the song or give the listener a headache; however in this case they do both. While I am happy to hear Lars is using double bass again, this does not make up for the rest of his performance. Another major production flaw is that it sounds like they just hung a microphone in someone's garage and jammed on half-assed ideas for an hour. The production, however, is not the sole reason this album fails. It is one of many major reasons this album fails. You know things are bad when \"...And Justice for All\" seems like a good production job. The difference here is that \"Justice\" was a metal masterpiece despite the bad production. St. Anger is just abysmal. The worst part is that they spent millions of dollars on the production for it to sound this way on purpose. Hell, even the \"No Life 'til Leather\" demo sounds better than this. \n\nThe lyrics are another major complaint I have. They are uninspired as well as immature. It sounds like something a 16 year old would write in a notebook at school or like they came from motivational posters at an AA meeting. Lyrics such as \"my lifestyle determines my deathstyle\" are an example of the great songwriting you will find here. All four members of the band are in their 40's, so there is no excuse for this. Cliff Burton, had he not been cremated, would be rolling in his grave. Even though he did say in an interview once that he could see Metallica playing softer music, that means yes, \"Justice\", and the \"Black Album\" would've happened, he would not have stood for this. I was, and still am, so disappointed by this disc and it is really hard to believe it was Metallica who put this out. This was no longer the band I once loved and supported.\n\nTo be honest, on rare occasions I have gone back and listened to this album a few times since my initial listening. Very rarely, I will find an album I couldn't stand the first couple times around actually grows on me. This, however, is not the case with \"St.Anger\", as it fails to change my opinion each and every time I hear it. The only song it is possible to suffer through is \"Frantic\" as it is easily the \"best\" song on the album. This isn't saying much, as it only serves as a forewarning for the garbage ahead. If you have been able to listen to the album entirely, you would know the songs get progressively worse. By the end of the last track, you will probably be searching for something to kill yourself with. This disc is the James and Lars show. Period. Some songs start strong, such as \"Some Kind of Monster\" and \"Dirty Window\", the latter sounds like a Motorhead song in the beginning; however, as soon as James sings, everything but his voice and those annoying drums fade to the background. I can't even make out a decent chord progression. It is just a wall of unintelligible garbage invading your eardrums. If they would have sought a tighter, crunchier sound, allowed Kirk to keep the solos he wrote, engaged the snare, and not looped the hell out of each song, this album could have lived up to what it should have been.\n\nLooking back at the album six years later, the album actually sounds worse now than it did then. This, I would say, is due to the release of \"Death Magnetic\". Also, because the album mainly dealt with the band's issues at the time, it feels very dated. The only reason I give a 15%, is because with the release of \"Death Magnetic\", Metallica showed us (or rather assured us) that \"St.Anger\" was not a permanent stylistic shift. Rather, it was a brave, albeit horribly failed, experiment.\n",
        "\nCall me nostalgic all you want, but I will never forget this album. It was the effort that catapulted Metallica into the public consciousness as the new torch bearers of metal, their crowning glory in their storied career, their massive raised middle finger to the establishment who called them \"noise\"...their triumph. Ozzy Osbourne knew this and took them out on tour with him to give them the shot they deserved, and they fired a hell of a bazooka shell into the world's ears with this album.\n\nWhere \"RTL\" began with more epic and dynamic song structures, \"MOP\" takes that new approach and runs with it like a prize quarterback. The thrashing madness is still very much there, as evidenced by bruising opener \"Battery\", the face-ripping \"Disposable Heroes\", and closer \"Damage, Inc.\" (one of my favorite song titles), but the more melodic and moody side they showed on \"RTL\" raises its head in a more refined and honed manner as well. \"Orion\" is the apex of this approach, with its classical feel and dreamy middle part with solos from James, Kirk, and Cliff--as I stated in my review of \"RTL\", I strongly feel that Metallica died when he did and have failed to admit it or acknowledge it since then.\n\n\"The Thing That Should Not Be\" brings the downtuned creepy-crawl with massive damage being caused in its wake--and how can you not like a song about H.P Lovecraft's Elder God Cthulhu? Metallica were so much more than simply a thrash band, they were a metal phenomenon in their prime, and their willingness to do more than thrash away at 100mph made this apparent. \"Leper Messiah\" is a another slower number, but brings plenty of crunch and aggression to the table to show Metallica had far from gone soft, accompanied by scathing lyrics denouncing televangelists--James had discovered CNN by this time and his lyrics were becoming deeper and more intelligent. Far from Shakespeare, but compared the lyrics on \"Kill 'Em All\", they were a quantum leap ahead for him.\n\n\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" was the anthem of practically every \"hip\" teenager in my high school, but only those of us true fans really understood its sentiments, as headbangers united against a world that mocked us, looked down upon us, and inspired us to snarl in defiance at their degrading us so. It may be the most mellow song on this album, but it still has an angry edge to it long before the tempo picks up and the riffs kick in. Metallica had a way of making songs like this work in that they incorporated that edge into even their softest moments, the building tension that would lead to explosive release, and they made it work in wonderfully brutal fashion.\n\nFlemming Rasmussen's production was even better this time around as well, bringing a much cleaner, more spacious sound to the proceedings. You could still hear Cliff pretty well and the guitars roared with a new clarity, as well as the drums sounding bigger and more damaging. The bass had its own niche in the mix as well, and Cliff's Godzilla low end rumble was reproduced in more detail on this album. Still not quite done justice, but it was there.\n\nIn short, this was Metallica's \"one shining moment\" to quote \"Camelot\", where they were poised to utterly destroy all in their path and they could've done it. But with Cliff Burton's untimely death, it all fell apart after this, and it's possibly metal's greatest tragedy. I remember a guy saying he was going to build a shrine in his bedroom to metal's greatest unsung bass hero when we received the news in my high school. What might have been...\"Master of Puppets\" is still the greatest moment in 80s metal, for me and always will be.\n",
        "\nThis was the first album I heard of these audacious Californians', and it made a massive dent in my ears from the start. In high school, a buddy of mine at the time made a cassette copy of this album for me, and from the first opening moments of \"Fight Fire With Fire\" and its delicate classical guitar plucking I knew I was in for something massive with the tension it built, and when the electric guitars came rising up and that first merciless RIFF blazed out of my speakers it was over. At that time, it was the fastest song I'd ever heard until I was exposed to Slayer's \"Hell Awaits\", and it took my breath away with its fury and intensity. Thus went my introduction to Metallica and it began a long love affair that has, like many affairs stagnated and fallen by the wayside as Metallica changed into mainstream suckage as opposed to the masterful mayhem on display here.\n\nFlemming Rasmussen's production was for the time clear and pretty well-defined, and you could hear Cliff Burton's vigorous bass approach rather well despite the raging wall of guitars generated by James Hetfield on this album. The drums are not overproduced, but sound good enough so that they don't override everything else. They actually sound rather natural, a good thing in this era of overtriggered typewriter drums that lack oomph and warmth. Kirk Hammett even weighs in with some nicely executed lead guitar parts that justify his reputation (ill-deserved these days) as a rather good player--and this comes from someone who always thought that he was the band's weak link. James' approach in the studio was changing drastically as well; not just content to bash out furious speed metal riffs, he took a whole new angle on their compositions with clean and acoustic guitar parts galore as well as slower, more epic riffs to go with the frenzy, and it was and still is awe-inspiring. \n\nOverall, the band comes off as a eager young bunch of thugs who had discovered dynamics and how to better play their instruments, and it shows, with the extensive touring behind \"Kill 'Em All\" benefiting their tightness and skills. The songwriting was already moving ahead and improving, with more depth and willingness to try new things, as the ending instrumental, \"Call of Ktulu\", evidences with its seething wall of sound anchored by Cliff's signature fuzz-wah gurgles on the bass--really, when he died, the band died with him, in my opinion. \"Fade To Black\" was something new for Metallica, too, a more subdued and subtle approach, with James' first attempts at melodic singing faring surprisingly well and the rideout being one of their most stirring and dramatic endings with Kirk's emotional soloing and the mournful harmony guitars underneath like a funeral procession. In fact, I prefer his clean singing on this song over most anytihng in that vein he's done since!\n\nThis to me was the first sign that Metallica were preparing to take the world by storm, with improvement across the board and eagerness to spare. Their take no prisoners approach being tempered by newfound maturity (musical, anyway) was already taking shape into the monolithic sound that would inspire legions of bands across the world, never mind America. This is one of my two favorite albums of theirs for a reason, and it still has a high position of esteem in my memories, my collection.\n",
        "\nSecond in the series of four classic thrash albums released by Metallica, Ride the Lightning is often elevated as the best of the bunch. Significant in that it is the first Metallica album to display the band\u2019s mature musicianship and more ambitious arrangements, Ride the Lightning nevertheless gets a bit more praise than it deserves as it highlights songwriting over pure speed and bloodlust, foundations upon which thrash was founded. Musicianship and melody are important tools, of course, but Metallica are at their best when they pull no punches and just hammer riffs down yer throat track after track (see: Kill \u2018Em All), which is something that they unfortunately do not do here.\n\nBut from some of these songs, you\u2019d hardly know that it\u2019s overrated. \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d is a fucking masterpiece, preceded by an unassuming classical acoustic bit that serves as a very dramatic counterpoint to the devastation that follows it. It\u2019s a trick they probably picked up from fellows Mercyful Fate (\u201cInto the Coven\u201d), but it\u2019s employed here to even greater effect. The song proper is a prime example of how much better Metallica got after Kill \u2018Em All. James Hetfield\u2019s nasty vocals, drums like explosives, the amazing lead harmonies: it started here folks. The title track and \u201cCreeping Death\u201d embody the forceful mid-paced spirit of the band (the latter has a nice Iron Maiden touch). It\u2019s here that you really get a feel for how good everything sounds on Ride the Lightning. The guitars and bass have definition, but it\u2019s still a very raw sound. James\u2019 vocals are also the best they\u2019d ever be right here, where he balances melody and aggression without sacrificing the shrieky quality of his Kill \u2018Em All voice. The last of the true thrashers on the album is \u201cTrapped Under Ice,\u201d which shares a riff or two with Exodus\u2019 \u201cImpaler\u201d (both of which were co-written by Kirk Hammett). Another speed-fest with a memorable bridge section, it begs the question why all the album\u2019s tracks weren\u2019t this brutal.\n\nNow before I continue, do not let it be said that I dislike this album. Ride the Lightning is a pivotal album in Metallica\u2019s career and one of the 80\u2019s many, many essential heavy metal albums. But with Metallica being considered the greatest thrash metal band of all time and this album usually considered their finest hour I have to disagree. Because if you look at it honestly, the album is not homogenous enough to really be considered a thrash album. A good thrash album should have a ratio of up-tempo songs to slower/experimental terrority of roughly 2:1. Here it\u2019s more like 1:3, with a lot of songs that stray towards the traditional metal sound. This is the kind of thing they\u2019d exhibit on Master of Puppets to even greater success and it\u2019s also why I\u2019ve scored it a bit lower than one might expect from my abundant praise in the preceding paragraphs. But on to those songs.\n\nFirstly, there\u2019s a pair of crunchy 80\u2019s metal tracks. \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d is the classic of the two. From the ominous sounding bells, Cliff\u2019s distorted bass lick, Kirk\u2019s repeated lead lick, and the heavy-as-fuck chords (and that\u2019s just the intro), it\u2019s an indisputable metal anthem coupled with one of Metallica\u2019s most poignant lyrical ventures. But with a pace that never dares exceed a solemn march, it\u2019s not exactly thrash now. The other track is \u201cEscape,\u201d which stands out on the album due to its optimistic lyrics and more traditional metal riffs. Another great song, another track that isn\u2019t thrash. Hardcore Metallica fans will fight to the death defending these two straightforward, traditional metal songs as legitimate Metallica thrashers, but when Metallica releases an entire album of songs like these (the black album), they disregard them as commercial swill. The irony here is so palpable that on a cool summer day you can actually taste it.\n\nFor the album\u2019s remainder, we have the two epic numbers. \u201cFade to Black\u201d could be likened to a power ballad, if the lyrics weren\u2019t so morose and the guitars didn\u2019t sound so fierce. With some of Hammett\u2019s most well thought out solos and a chilling pair of clean riffs for the intro and verses, it\u2019s one of my favorite Metallica tracks. It also begins a precedent of mellow-starting, heavy-ending \u201cballads\u201d that would continue to appear on the band\u2019s albums (and with the exception of St. Anger, they all appear as track 4 on their respective releases). \u201cThe Call of Ktulu\u201d is the album closer and it begins the precedent of having a really long instrumental piece near the album\u2019s end. This one begins with an awesome clean riff set (alleged Mustaine riffs) that builds anticipation before becoming much heavier. Cliff returns to some of his \u201cAnesthesia\u201d tomfoolery while Hammett shreds and Lars is everywhere. But aside from the furious climaxes, this one long outlives its welcome, just as future Metallica instrumentals would inevitably do (more on this later, perhaps). \n\nAnd there you have it. \u201cThe Greatest Thrash Metal Album of All Time. Ever.\u201d An album that, like Master of Puppets after it, achieves this status in the eyes of fans not by being the best damn thrash album it can be, but by utilizing musical ideas foreign to the genre to such an extent that many of its songs are no longer a part of it. In short, it\u2019s considered a great thrash album because much of it isn\u2019t thrash. Somebody explain that one to me, because I just don\u2019t get it. No one is a more ardent supporter of variety in thrash metal than I am, and even I feel that the core of this album is not rooted enough in the essence of the genre to be one of its cornerstone albums. \n\nOf course, how \u201cthrash\u201d it is will probably have little bearing on most listeners\u2019 opinions. It is a great album and a mandatory purchase for metal enthusiasts. But if you\u2019re one of those that think that this is the greatest thing the genre has to offer, you\u2019ve got a lot to learn, friend.\n\nNotable Tracks: \u201cFight Fire With Fire,\u201d \u201cFade to Black,\u201d \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d\n",
        "\nSo, here's the second Metallica album of the decade; boy, these guys are on a roll with their productivity. Yes, despite only putting out an album once every five fucking years, Metallica are still just about the most talked about metal band everywhere, for better or for worse - but seriously, there's such a thing as coasting on reputation, and then there's Metallica. I mean, it genuinely pisses me off. This kind of thing seems to happen with a lot of really huge bands and artists - new albums only once every half-decade, or worse in the case of Guns n Roses, for example. It's lazy and it doesn't make any sense.\n\nBut that's not why we're here, is it? No, we're here to talk about how good Death Magnetic is, so let's just dive right in. For a normal band, one that, oh, I don't know, sticks to a higher level of quality material and spiritual peace, it is usually expected that an album released after five years will be of a reasonably high quality, given the amount of time the band should have had to write it under normal circumstances (Human Fortress notwithstanding). However, for Metallica, expectations were significantly lower due to reasons that you can probably guess, and for that, I think the band did a pretty admirable job at meeting-slash-surpassing them.\n\nDeath Magnetic is the sound of a band sobered up and ready to get back to business after their wild, drunken night of streaking across a populated football field in St. Anger from 2003, and it's nothing if not adamant. The basic sound is heavy, angry modern rock/metal that doesn't really swerve off its linear path at all in its hour-long duration. The songs are generally very long and drawn out, although really, the main draw behind this album lies in the manic, bashing anger and vindictive enthusiasm the band put into it. This whole album may be a cop-out for the fans after they didn't like the band's previous direction, but I'll be damned if it isn't done with some real flare. The riffs here might be a little substandard at times, and the songs tend to drag on a little - okay, a lot - but this is just so cathartically delightful in its heavy, rocky riffs and aggressive shouting, and it is a lot more listenable than St. Anger at that. No, that isn't a good reason to praise this album, just on the basis of being better than its predecessor, but come on! \"That Was Just Your Life\" is a snarling, gritty ball-buster that just rocks out without pretension, and I dig the unbridled rage on display here - simple, bashing payback time at its best, this one is the soundtrack you'll be using the next time you go out for revenge against your enemies. Even the lyrics follow suit, being professionally trained babbling of the highest order. It's like they just made this shit up on the spot in order to sound as menacing and angry as possible. It's like how a bully would talk to you while he's surrounded by his buddies and you're all alone cowering in the corner. It doesn't matter what he says; he's just talking shit in the heat of the moment to make you piss yourself even more than you already had. Sure, it's a jumble of incoherence, but it gets the job done and sounds cool.\n\nThe whole album is kind of like that. \"The End of the Line\" is along the same lines (ha-ha), with James Hetfield's dry, Southern-twinged voice belting out vocal lines that are nothing if not completely infused with this blood-red desire for vengeance. Even the stomping \"Broken Beat & Scarred\" and the catchy groove-fest \"Cyanide\" have their charms along those same lines, with infectious hooks to boot. \"All Nightmare Long\" is the best song on this thing, simply because it takes the elements that were good about those other songs and amplifies them tenfold, with a prowling tempo and a headstrong set of riffs that always remind me of the movie Predator for some reason - it's just the general atmosphere of the thing; it sounds like Hetfield is about to load up his gun and go down into the marsh to fight off the alien. The groove here is just sinister as hell, very cool stuff.\n\nAnd yes, I don't despise \"The Unforgiven III,\" as it is actually one of the better vocal performances I've heard out of modern Hetfield - yeah, his voice isn't so good these days, but he put some real feeling into this one, and it manages to sound quite good despite the introductory pianos sounding like something out of a soap commercial. The music isn't always interesting, but the song doesn't turn out to be anything despicable.\n\n\"The Judas Kiss\" is good, but too long, and \"The Day That Never Comes\" is fun at first, but quickly gets old, especially for the fact that it's basically the same thing as \"Fade to Black,\" \"Welcome Home\" and \"One.\" \"Suicide and Redemption\" is the only truly bad song on here, an instrumental that jerks itself off for nine minutes straight and leaves no real impression. There are some strange, out of place guitar effects here that don't sound right with the primal caveman thunking of the rest of the album at all. It's like an endless prelude to a climax that never comes (or a day that never comes, ha-ha), and by the time the short thrasher \"My Apocalypse\" rolls by and ends the album, you just don't care anymore. Cut this shit out next time, guys, and give us an album that doesn't wear out its welcome. For that really is the biggest flaw with Death Magnetic: it's just too long, and thus some of the bruising, pathological anger is lost in the fray of the elongated song structures.\n\nI really do like this album, though, for all its faults. It's the big, bumbling drunk brother who comes to crash at your place after running from the cops. He's mean and he's rude, and he disrupts any sense of logical flow your evening may have had, but you can't turn him loose; he's your goddamned brother, and he is a lot of fun to play Nintendo with despite the fact that he's putting you in the line of trouble, too. Death Magnetic is, yeah, pretty much like that. When you get down to brass tacks with this scruffy and unruly customer, it really is an enjoyable album. It's got catchy choruses, heavy riffs and a nice, attitude-filled groove, and that is enough for me to endorse this. Metallica, good luck to you on your future endeavours, and we will see you again in 2013. Now to go wait for the next Iron Maiden album and grey my hair some more.\n\nPS, isn't it lovely that they released more than half of this album as singles for those of you who already bought the album and wanted more? Delightful.\n",
        "\nIt seems that a lot of people- or at least music critics- always talk about The Beatles being the best band ever. \"Dude, they revolutionised music\" \"Sgt.Pepper is massive boner times\" \"I would like to perform fellatio on McCartney\" and so on and so forth. Others will talk about various dead guys, both black and white; Coltrane, Louis Armstrong, Mozart and Beethoven etc. I always find this confusing and strange talk, until I realize: clearly, these guys have not heard any early Metallica! Friends, people who say that the Beatles or perhaps Mozart are/were the greatest are not worthy of your scorn or anger, but pity; after all, they have yet to take in the beauty, the wonder that are the three Metallica albums that Cliff was on. Really, it's amazing what two idiot savants, a babyfaced lead guitarist and, er, Lars (and another i.s making a brief cameo in the form of Dave) were able to achieve.\n\nWhereas the earlier clips are mostly notable for the crazy energy and the \"youthful\" vocals, the later clips are a pretty good reminder of just how freaking monolithic Metallica were in the mid 80's. Lars makes it all a bit more energetic by playing every song (including the ballads) at a much faster tempo then usual, and Kirk's pretty enthusiastic, but the two are completely overshadowed by the absolute domination that was Cliff and James circa '85, which really is what this video is about. The two both have a rather different live presence but they're both a sight to behold. Cliff's all chilled and hippie like, playing his bass with an uncanny natural-ness. I've never said he was the greatest or anything, but damn, he and the Rickenbacker look so natural and at ease together. James resembles more of a drunken, angry demigod; less about chilling with his explorer and more about hoping to kill someone if they get too close. The huge live presence of these guys is best shown on the epic rendition of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" at Day on the Green... Huge! I wish I was there but I wasn't even born yet.\n\nIt helps that it's all been captured so well, too. While I don't have a problem with 24 camera angle, super hi-fi live recording and the like, a bit of rawness does wonders. This has got a pretty good mix; there's a few multiple camera efforts but also a bunch of single handycam efforts (or whatever they had 24 years ago). It's all of a decent quality, even if a few heads do get in the way. The audio quality follows in this vein; raw, sometimes distorted and clipping, but there's always plenty of clarity and it's easy enough to tell what's going on. Certainly it's something that more bands could learn from; a live video is certainly more fun if you feel like you're there in the crowd, getting kicked in the head by crowd surfers and getting pissed on by the guy behind you. There's also some short little beer 'n' bong interludes scattered throughout but they're quick enough to not really offend you, just a good enough way to swap between songs.\n\nNow, we're talking Metallica in the mid 80's, so while I shouldn't have to mention the music beyond \"of course it's awesome, dipshit\" some description is probably required. I guess it wouldn't be awesome if they played \"Thing that Should Not Be\" the whole time, after all (or even if they just played it once). Luckily there's no terrible attempts at Lovecraftian atmosphere, just plenty of ridiculously catchy, well-arranged and rather heavy thrash with a few competent ballads and slower tunes thrown in. That stupendous piece of thunderous riffs and huge choruses that's \"Creeping Death\" is rather suitable as the opener, and it's winners all of the way- some super fast and energetic renditions of Kill 'Em All tunes recorded sometime in '83 or so, and otherwise a bunch of much larger shows, with Ozzy, in festivals and the like. Shame there's no \"Fight Fire with Fire\" but regardless all of the songs are excellent; \"Fade to Black\" manages quite well despite James butchering the vocals a bit, \"Four Horsemen\" is fast, tight and epic, but overall it's probably most of the faster, shorter songs off KEA that I like the most here, maybe it's because I haven't heard that album in ages. \"Whiplash\", \"Metal Militia\" and \"No Remorse\" all make some appearances here and they're all freaking awesome, ok, perhaps not as complex, heavy or, well, good as some of the stuff that's from Master of Puppets, but just really enjoyable and commanding in their tight, fairly simple riffing and wah-free soloing. So if the KEA stuff is more enjoyable then the rendition of MOP's title track, for example, then surely that stuff isn't perfect too, then? You'd be surprised; \"Damage Inc.\" and the title track are indeed perfect, too. Hell, even \"Sanitarium\" sounds amazing.\n\nThe only real bummer here would have to be the bass solos. I can understand why you'd put them in and all but that doesn't make them sound good or anything. Cliff was a good bassist but not the best, and whether it's Joe Blow or Jimmy Page I've yet to hear an unaccompanied, improvised shred solo that's actually worth listening too. Yes, he had good chops and played with his fingers and all that; I'd just much rather see that in the context of a song, not a pointless solo.\n\nHowever, pointless, momentum sapping bass solos can't hide the fact that this is Metallica, in their golden, best-band-ever era, playing their best songs from that era, in a video that captures that in a really good way. That's some pretty irrefutable logic right there. Buy this and partake in the transcendent glory.\n",
        "\nTexas. \n1998. \nPoor Re-Touring Me tour.\nWorth Watching? Yes.\nWoth its Price? Not Really.\nKick-Ass? Yes.\nAs Kick-Ass as Live Shit? Unfortunately, No.\nBut Still Kick-Ass? Yes.\n\nThis video was made when, according to most metalheads, Metallica was at the beggining of their \"Sell-Out Era\" (And what an annoying term!). As you may notice, all the 80's songs are already tuned in an E Flat like today's shows, and all the members had their hair cutted, like today's shows. It's kind of the sign of what Metallica are today (Though I think they're more kick-ass today than on this DVD). \n\nBut let's go to the concert. It starts with \"So What!?\" On a normal stage that in the midtime of the song goes dark. Not bad at all (The effect). Some songs aren't what they were before, such as Creeping Death (Which I Found Lacking of Energy), Fuel (Metallica seem confused on this one) or Motorbreath (Idem). And though James' Mid-90s Melodic Voice works really good and appropriate on songs like Hero of The Day, King Nothing, Ain't My Bitch or Until it Sleeps; It seems quite Annoying on the 80's songs, or even in the distorted 90's Songs (Such as Fuel). The Backing Vocals done by Jason are reat (I've always thought he's a great Backing-Vocalist, or at least in Metallica) and Kirk's Backing Vocals.... I'll just say that they aren't good.\n\nThe Enter Sandman accident scene is one of the things that keeps you stuckk to the chair, because you didn't expect it, you didn't think it was coming, and furthermore, you think \"Why the hell is an accident like the Montreal one on the Concert and I didn't hear it on the News?\". Good scene. Another worth-watching one is the Bass guitar Doodle, showing us that Jason knows how to compose good Bass melodies, and a great performance of \"My Firend of Mysery\" and \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\". The \"Making of\" Part is not necessary, but still good; though I found James' declarations proper of a Sevent-Heaven Hollywood Star (Which Annoys me, thank God he's not talking that way now).\n\nIn conclusion; it's not a bad Live DVD, but it's nothing like Live Shit. On LS you found really Blood-Sweat-&-Tears songs, passioned-but-fun performing and shots that make you feel you're really on San Diego (Or Seattle). If you are a Metalli-Die-Hard Fan (Speacially of the 80's Era), haven't bought a Metallica Live DVD and want to buy one, Live Shit is for you. But if you have already bought Live Shit and want to see how Metallica did their songs live back on the late 90's (And watch James live performing on some good Load-ReLoad songs); you'd better Watch Cunning Stunts. Over-Prized; but still an acceptable Live Album you should have if you're a Metallica Fan. \n\nAnd as a final note: Looking at the way they do their shows know, I can assure you that their Death Magnetic tour Concerts are a little bit more exciting that this one (And they would be a lot more exciting if today concerts had such scenes as the Enter Sandman ones!).\n\nScore: 4,1/5 - 81/100\nHighlights: So What!?, Bass-Guitar Doodle, Enter Sandman\nBoring Points: Wherever I May Roam, Am I Evil?\n",
        "\nRight, honesty time here. I used to absolutely LOVE St. Anger. It was my first ever Metallica album and my bible for ages upon ages, but after a year or 2, I collected the rest of their albums and St. Anger fell out of favour. When I decided to dig out St. Anger again for this review, I was sceptical. I was going to listen through it then just give it a 60% rating on the basis that \"It's pretty poor, but I like it for some reason. It's Metallica, it's good. End of.\" But something unplanned happened. I began to recall just how good this album was and it climbed in percentage with nearly every song and I've remembered why I loved this album in the first place. \n\nNow, the above paragraph is tantamount in the metal community to saying that Bruce Dickinson sucks big fat ones and that Trivium are the greatest band of all time, with Atreyu second. It will most probably get you lynched. The derision for this album is unreal. Imagine Cold Lake, Swansong and The Unspoken King wrapped into one big fat package of hate. Then times it by a million. This album was being hailed as \"a return to their roots\" and when the previews hinted at 8-minute long epics, people started comparing it to ...And Justice For All and Master of Puppets. The first couple of weeks were positive, with Number 1s in Charts all over the world and mostly Positive reviews. But then something happened. I don't know what but SOMETHING did happen. Everyone turned on the album. Critics who had hailed it as a return to form started panning it, the fans were decidedly unpleased and the album withered away.\n\nBut why? Well, where do we start? There's so many tired-old excuses raised about the flaws of this album. But the main one is usually about the production. It's not very good, and not in a Darkthrone kind of \"not very good\". It's just not very good. They've certainly succeeded in achieving a \"raw, garage sound\", and it is a good production to an extent. But it's TOO raw. It's too rough and muddy, there is many parts during this album where the infamous \"wall of noise\" comes into play, where it's all just one big lumpen thrashy mess. It can be good at times, but not at others. It sort of depends on what mood you're in and it varies from song-to-song. The drums ARE REALLY FUCKING LOUD IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOMEONE SHOUTING IN YOUR EAR ALL THE TIME IS REALLY FUCKING LOUD. Well, it is for the first song or 2, but they are 2 of the best songs on the album. Also, there's the snare. It CAN grate very easily, but those with a patient ear will be able to become accustomed to it. They might not necessarily love it, but they'll come to accept it.\n\nAnother aspect of the sound is the guitar tone. I fucking love the tone on this album. It sounds so sludgy and doomy and well, raw. But it has a sense of pervading gloom hanging over it that is just mind-boggling. To try and describe it is hard, but I'd say, you know that ever-annoying question that comes up every so often when you run out of things to say about Metallica, \"What would it be like if Load was more metal?\". Well, this is it. It's got the tone of Load (Which I loved by the way) but with more crunch. The Bass is only audible sometimes, and James' Vocals are possibly the only thing clear in this mix.\n\nThe Guitars are another much-maligned part of this album. Kirk Hammett doesn't really need to play on this album at all. This is Hetfield's album essentially. There is no Solos, hell there isn't even any lead parts. That is not an overexaggeration. Hammett just copies Hetfield pretty much all the time throughout this album, the closest we got to a lead is on The Unnamed Feeling, but he just makes random noises. It's as much a SunnO))) lead as it is a Metallica lead. The Bass is fairly interesting, when you can hear it, which is very rarely ever, and it's in short bursts, but it is pretty funky and well done to Bob Rock. But most of the time, it just blends in, playing the same riffs as the guitars. The drums, once you get past the toe-curling sound, are actually pretty good. I've seen many a review accusing Lars of being lazy on this album, but I fail to see how. He's brought back the double bass (and very well, might I add) and he does some fairly interesting patterns throughout the album. Alright, so he's no Mike Portnoy, but was he ever a Mike Portnoy? Even on Justice, he didn't go over-the-fucking-top, ala DT. He did what was needed and that was that. It's hardly fair to expect him to buck the trend by now, is it? I personally believe Lars' performance on this album is exceptional and possibly the best thing on it. Hetfield's vocals are a bit out-of key but they show passion. Each song sounds like he's screaming his lungs out with rage, but also he sounds like he's having fun doing it, that it's not a drag or a chore that he has to do these vocals, it feels like he wants to fucking shout and scream and generally go \"AAAAAAAAAARGGGGGGGGGGGGH!!\"\n\nIn terms of actual songs, it's a mixed bag. There is some absolutely amazing songs, Frantic and Dirty Window spring straight to mind, as being absolute classics. Two of the more thrashier ones, they just BLISTER along, unrelenting. Dirty Window sounds like so much fun to play, and that main riff is absolutely fantastic, I love it. These two songs are absolute classics and would make sensible additions to any Metallica setlist. Songs getting the silver medal include All Within My Hands, a monolithic sludge epic, which gets to the point where it's so fractured that it collapses around itself and dies. (The acoustic version reinforced this, adding more depth.) and Sweet Amber which is more brooding and dark than the other songs mentioned, but still has the quality associated with Metallica. The singles, St. Anger, The Unnamed Feeling and Some Kind of Monster, are all not bad, but not as good as the four mentioned before. The rest of the songs are also not bad but are all interchangable. Many of the songs sound identical and you'll get lost in the mire and they'll just fly by. And I now come to another point of derision on this album. This album is 70 minutes plus, with only 13 songs, that's roughly 5 or 6 minutes per song. Now this is the norm with Metallica, the average song by them is about this length if not longer. But the problem is that they are very drawn out. For example, St. Anger seems to consist of about 3 riffs for the whole song and it's about 6/7 minutes long. The radio edits cut sizeable chunks of the song out, and it flowed much better and didn't grate nearly as much as the album version. An example would be Some Kind of Monster, a song so drawn out that I have witnessed Autumns which last for a shorter length of time. On the SKOM EP, the video edit was considerably shorter and is favoured by most of Metallica's diehard fanbase. It seems that Lars went mental with Pro Tools and just pressed Ctrl+V a lot. The lowest of the low, though, has to be Purify. It isn't anything horrific on this studio version, but the DVD which came with this album consisting of rehearsal footage totally ruined this song for me, it's the broken-voice backing vocals of the chorus. Woeful. It's got some not bad ideas in it, but I just do not like it for that simple reason. But that's only because I'm harbouring a grudge.\n\nIn short, there is many flaws with this album. MANY, MANY flaws with this album. The drums ARE REALLY LOUD AND GO DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN ALL THE TIME. This album is way too long, they've taken the idea of repetition to the extreme, and there isn't much in the way of variation. There isn't any solos, or anything in the way of progressive riffs like on Justice. The production isn't very good, and Hetfield is out of key. These are all valid points, but the question must be asked: If Metallica were to re-record this with a better production, fixing that snare and re-working the songs so to add solos and trim fat, would it get a better reaction? Well, If it was released tomorrow, I believe it wouldn't simply because it's St. Anger. There's a stigma attached to this, it's an unwritten law that if you are Metal, you must hate this album. Fact. But if they had released this hypothetical \"St. Reworked\" album instead of the original album, would it have fared better? And, once again, the answer is no. Not only did they put solos into Frantic when they played it live, but they didn't sound very good and forced as a result of the fan's reaction. Regardless of their output, there will always be people who will slate this and shout \"OMFG SELLOUT MALLCORE FAIL LOLZ KREATOOOOOR!\" on Blabbermouth until they turn blue. There will always be people who regard Sepultura to have peaked with Morbid Visions, and that Kreator should just do nothing but play \"Flag of Hate\" or stuff off Pleasure To Kill over and over again. There will always be people who regard the heart and soul of Metallica to be Lloyd Grant and will slate this to death. Perhaps they'd give it a 5% rating, instead of a 0%, because Frantic had more of a thrash vibe to it. \n\nBasically, what I'm getting at is that Metallica can do no right. Every move they make will end up in SOME people who'll view them lower than a holocaust-denying sex offender who once pissed on the constitution. If they decided \"Right, we'll just go and re-do our 80s thrash stuff again\", they'll get called \"Sellouts\" for trying to pander to the metalheads, but if they decide to do their own thing, they'll get branded \"Sellouts who don't care about their fanbase\". All this, despite the fact that Metallica are possibly one of the least sellout-y bands in the upper echelons of Metal. It boggles my mind as to why people call Metallica sellout. Do they release a live album every 3 weeks like Maiden or Testament? No. Do they put out endless compilations? No. Metallica offer good value for their fans through things such as Mission Metallica, Live Metallica and the Metallica Fan Club. All those people who call this a \"business venture\" are obviously not very business-savvy. The idea of making money in business is to give your customer fanbase something they want. If this was a money-making exercise for them, they would simply have rehashed MOP on every album, and not bothered with progressing or making new ideas. I would say a band like Cannibal Corpse, or Kataklysm would be more of a money-making venture than Metallica. I'm pretty sure that NO Metallica fan specifically wanted them to go in this direction. If I went out into the streets in 2001/2002 and asked hundreds of Metallica fans \"What do you want from their new album?\", I can pretty much guarantee you that they would not have said a description of St. Anger. The idea that this album is a business venture is like Mr. Kipling deciding his next \"business venture\" is to put bits of glass in his cakes, because he thinks they'll sell more.\n\nIf this had been released by any other band, it would've probably have done far better. If a band like Trivium had released this as a debut, they'd probably be more acclaimed by metalheads for being more avant-garde, and if a band like Evile or Gama Bomb had released this, or even just a new band in general, not necessarily a thrash one, they'd be praised for their vision and originality, and it would be hailed as a troubled classic. As a result of it being Metallica, it will never get the recognition it deserves. The fans' backlash against the fact that it wasn't MOP has become contagious to the point where it's illegal to like this album, the press (which gave it good reviews at first) have latched on to the bandwagon and now hate this release. The album's downfall doesn't lie with Metallica, but with it's fans. The fact of the matter is that this record is a perfectly good release with a bad reputation. The Napster scandal and the 90s output have alienated people to anything by Metallica (A point proven by the hatred emanating from certain corners of the metal world for Death Magnetic, a record designed with the 80s in mind). \n\nAs a purely musical object, this is 70/75%, but the no remorse, no relent aesthetic and Metallica's reluctance to pander to the baying audience elevates this album higher than most. This has heart, unlike recent Megadeth or Slayer releases which seem to be forced and going through the motions. As Hetfield himself says on this album \"St. Anger never gets respect\" and it is because of this that it never gets respect. An album with as much vision and individuality as this will never be seen ever again, it is a once in a lifetime album. In years to come, maybe people will relax their inhibitions about it and slowly begin to like it, but I doubt it. Metal Archives rules states that reviews aren't meant to be JUST about the music, but about the album as a whole. This album is about so much more than the music. The back-story of the SKOM film, the uniqueness of this album, and Metallica's sheer reluctance to do anything other than what they want to do are just some of the reasons why this album gets a perfect rating from me.\n\nYou will never hear another album like St. Anger, it is a wholly unique entity and for that, it should be praised.\n",
        "\n\"No Life til' Leather\" is such a surprising and entertaining demo in so many ways, I don't even know where to start. I suppose I might as well give some background. Having obsessed repeatedly over Metallica's first album \"Kill em' All\" since my middle school days, I already knew every song on this demo better than any album, save maybe \"Take off your pants and Jacket.\"\n\nIn a way, the minor differences in the production, solos, lyrics and many other discrepancies of this demo from \"Kill em' All\" are but mere fodder for more obsession! Imagine all of the stupid arguments between fanboys over who played the Seek and Destroy solo better, \"Dave Mustaine or Kirk Hammett?\" It's almost as if there should be a heavy metal homage to \"Clerks\"! I personally think the live version on \"Cliff Em' All\" with Dave Mustaine is the coolest simply because it has that amazing tremolo lick that sets it apart from Hammett's.\n\nBut the music is what's important, and not the petty arguments. The demo begins the same way as KEA with Hetfield and Mustaine tremolo picking the reliable E5 power chord, then the F#5. So simple, and yet so effective. How I wish I could have been alive when they began every show this way. The less than impressive production doesn't take anything away from this great intro to one of Metallica's greatest songs. The rest of the song is full of surprises. There's more effects on James' voice, most notably tape delay. I see nothing wrong with this. He hits higher notes, and holds them longer than on the LP version. This is the most notable difference in his voice back in those days, except he doesn't have that grit that makes his vocals so awesome on kill em' all, ride the lightning, Master of Puppets and various live performances.\n\nThen there's the mighty Mustaine. I personally am a bigger fan of Megadeth than Metallica, simply from a guitar player's standpoint. Let's face it: He's superior to Hetfield in the rhythm department. His riffs are so much more satisfying to listen to, and are played with such great precision, not to take anything away from Hetfield's great riffs. But there are so many more great riffs in the Megadeth catalogue, and he's certainly a better soloist than Hammett, particularly in the present tense.\n\nBut you wouldn't say that just from listening to some of the solos on No Life til' Leather. Mustaine's solos are kind of all over the place, and not always in a good way. He repeats the same pentatonic licks in almost every song. Although it still sounds good, Hammett's playing had a wise sense of restraint. He really took the time to come up with more memorable solos, especially on Whiplash. Some of the solos are pure Mustaine though, and I prefer his solos in \"Jump in the Fire\" and \"Phantom Lord.\" Of course he's the one who wrote the damn solos in the first place, some of which Hammett copied almost note for note! And it was Mustaine who upon first hearing the Lars' and James rough demo of \"Hit the Lights\" said, \"This song sucks. It needs more solos.\"\n\nBut the most ironic thing about this demo is the bass. It's actually more audible here than on Kill 'em All. And Cliff Burton wasn't even playing here, it was Ron Mcgovney! The \"Beer getter\" for the then underage band! Let's face it, every up and coming band has its Ron Mcgovney. This makes the album's production seem less trebly, and in some cases makes the songs heavier, like on \"Jump in the Fire.\" This may have been because they wanted to achieve the same sound as the nwobhm bands they were covering at the time, in which the bass was sometimes just as audible as the guitars. How strange it is that on most of the Metallica albums that followed, you could barely hear the bass at all. That's one aspect about Metallica I will never understand, because it's so sad that a genius bassplayer such as Cliff Burton had the volume turned down on every album he played.\n\nOverall this is an astonishingly good demo from a then up-and-coming band, and I highly recommend it to any Metallica or thrash fan. It's worth pointing out that there's a distinct difference between a Metallica fan and a thrash metal fan, but both should enjoy this.\n",
        "\nIf there\u2019s one thing I hate about a new Metallica album coming out, it\u2019s the ridiculous amount of scrutiny that it\u2019s going to fall under. More so than other bands that have the status of \u201cincredibly well-known,\u201d every aspect of a Metallica album will be pored over by their legion of listeners: from the fanboys, to those that have hated everything since the 80\u2019s, to those wavering in between. And no album more than this one, the hotly anticipated followup to the disastrous St. Anger. Entitled Death Magnetic, the album aspires to be (as did St. Anger) a well-received return to form, with several introductory claims to back it up: long-time producer Bob Rock is out, famed producer Rick Rubin is in; the defanged logo is out, the old logo is back with a vengeance; the cover art is cool as shit. Certainly a band of Metallica\u2019s stature would be able to live up to such claims\u2026right?\n\nMy first impression of the album prior to listening to it (based on buzz and the early singles) was of a shallow return to form. Metallica, after all, are notorious bandwagon jumpers when it comes to trends. When thrash was no longer fashionable, the band jumped ship to hard rock for Load/Reload. When nu-metal was at its peak, they released St. Anger. Now, with a modern resurgence of technical heavy metal (thrash included), Metallica claim that they\u2019re ready to strap on their boots and kick us square in the ass like they haven\u2019t since \u201988. Anybody who wasn\u2019t skeptical at this was surely na\u00efve, as they\u2019ve promised this before. And after hearing Kirk Hammett claim to have been influenced by Trivium (he sucks Matt Heafy\u2019s dick all through an October \u201906 Guitar World interview (not literally, of course)), I naturally feared for the worst.\n\nHowever my fears were a bit unfounded. Truth be told, Metallica have never strayed from form; they\u2019ve merely reshaped that form to accommodate their current needs. At times this has produced less than desired results (Reload, St. Anger, \u201cI Disappear\u201d), but the material produced is nonetheless distinctly Metallica. As such, the first and most important thing I can stress about Death Magnetic is that it is distinctly Metallica. Aspects developed throughout their entire career surface here, from the devastating fury of \u2026And Justice for All, to the compositionally solid, hook-laden metal of MoP or the Black Album, to the infectious groove of the Load brothers, to the dense, abrasive spatter of St. Anger, and occasionally even to the raw energy of their earliest material. \n\nAnd so, being distinctly a Metallica album, it follows what has been historically the band\u2019s primary directive: variance of style. There are several categories of songs on Death Magnetic and just as on past releases, they sometimes conflict with one another. Of course, it is the return of the thrash songs that are of most interest. Opener \u201cThat Was Just Your Life\u201d is total \u201cBlackened\u201d worship, but damn is it refreshing. It is the first taste of the album as a whole and Rick Rubin\u2019s production job, which is pretty good. The guitars are out in front and they\u2019re fucking lethal, with abundant, vintage Metallica harmony passages returning to good measure. Vocals are the next focus and while they aren\u2019t ideal for James Hetfield (to get that, you\u2019d have to travel back in time some twenty-four years), they\u2019re tolerable. It\u2019s kinda like the more aggressive Black Album vocals with none of that \u201ckeep searcANNNN\u201d bullshit from St. Anger. The drums are the third significant instrument in the mix. This is also good, as it maintains the album\u2019s energy and gives the listener plenty of opportunity to hear Lars Ulrich\u2019s signature drumming idiosyncrasies. People bitch about how they still lack definition; I say they resemble the strict, battering drums that sounded on \u2026And Justice. Would you prefer the trash cans from the last album?\n\nBut anyway, that first song fucking slays. Easily the best track on the album and one of several throwbacks to the \u2026And Justice For All album. One can go online to find some forum jockey point out far more coincidences than I could mention (ignoring \u201cThe Unforgiven III,\u201d the tracklists synch up pretty well), but the diminished bass sound is certainly among them. Though not to the degree of Justice, there are few occasions where Rob Trujillo\u2019s bass operates independently of the guitars. A shame if you ever heard him with Suicidal Tendencies, it\u2019s one of but a handful of complaints I have against Death Magnetic. The others? In due time.\n\n\u201cThe End of the Line\u201d and \u201cBroken, Beat & Scarred\u201d represent the mid-paced contingent and upkeep the image of the album as a return to form. Lots of riffs, harmonies, and soloing to be found. Kirk Hammett still uses his wah pedal much more often than I\u2019d like, but it\u2019s no more than he did on the old records, I suppose (at least he solos at all). You hardly notice the guitars are down-tuned either, so pure is the riffage.\n\nIndeed much of the album sticks to the heavy format, with closer \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d being the other speedy number and most of the remaining songs at least keeping an energetic pace. Of these, \u201cCyanide\u201d is the grooviest number, a sort-of throwback to the Load era. Sort-of because it\u2019s still pretty damn heavy and littered with harmonies and shit. Of course, there are a few one-offs present; it is a Metallica album you know. Firstly is \u201cThe Day That Never Comes,\u201d the single that probably convinced most people whether or not they wanted to get the album. One of the \u201cMetallica ballads\u201d also consisting of \u201cOne,\u201d \u201cFade to Black,\u201d and \u201cSanitarium\u201d (start mellow, get heavier, end heaviest), it probably wasn\u2019t the best first taste for the consumers (that intro riff is misleadingly mallcorish). Here the drum sound convinced me that the song would not suck on the whole and it doesn\u2019t, even if Hammett\u2019s solo is a little contrived. \u201cSuicide & Redemption\u201d is another throwback, this time to the super-long instrumentals of old. It\u2019s about as good as any of them, though I\u2019ve never been particularly fond of the past ones. Just a bit too much of the same thing (this is mere seconds under the ten minute mark).\n\n\u201cThe Unforgiven III\u201d is probably the most out of place here. My second thought while listening to this song was of furious stylistic bigots racing to their keyboards in order to see who could bitch about it first. My first thought was that the song fucking rules. The piano intro, the string layers, the slow Load-ish tempo: this track shows that Metallica can still write with a little bit of feeling when the need arises. Honestly, I don\u2019t think it should have arisen here (it\u2019s the weakest song on the album), but it\u2019s listenable. A sort-of interlude from the heavier remainder.\n\nOverall, the album proved to be a surprisingly rejuvenated metal album, if not exclusively thrash. The only other big flaw I can find in the album is the lyrical content. Now while Hetfield was never exactly a poetic genius, he at least managed to deliver some clever wordplay and a relatable discontent. Death Magnetic keeps away from the personal crises of St. Anger, but it\u2019s brash, death-centric lines come across about the same way. Obtuse or spastic at best (\u201cScorch\u2026.kill the light, Incinerate celebrity, Reaper\u2026.butchery, Karma amputee\u201d) and downright retarded at worst (\u201cWhat don\u2019t kill ya make ya more strong\u201d), the listener will find Death Magnetic\u2019s lyrics to be far less\u2026.well, cooler than those of the past. It\u2019s also a bit long to listen to in one sitting, clocking in near the 80-minute CD limit. I guess when you take several years to arrange and record an album, you feel obligated to cram as much music into it as is physically possible.\n\nBut shit, man, it\u2019s relativity here. It\u2019s the best Metallica album in the last two decades and, having given myself plenty of time to listen to and digest it (despite my initial post-St. Anger pledge of never again purchasing a Metallica album, I had it the day after it was released), it stands the test of time. Those waiting for the band to sound exactly like they used to will have to keep waiting \u2018cause it ain\u2019t going to happen, this is probably as close as it\u2019ll get. Whether or not the album is a truly honest effort will be forever debated, but fuck it, I can listen to this album and actually enjoy it. Which is something I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to say about a new Metallica album.\n",
        "\nI just don\u2019t get the shit about this album being the best they\u2019ve done in 20 years. I mean, the only album this is better than is St. Anger. This is far from half of what the black album was; and even Load & Reload were better if you ask me. At least while making those albums the music didn\u2019t sound so forced and fake. Here it\u2019s like you can almost make out that the band doesn\u2019t want to do what it\u2019s doing. Their aim probably was just to add a lot of random riffs to make it sound cool/complex. In a need to sound epic, 7 of the 10 tracks are more than 7 minutes long, clearly overstaying their welcome.\n\nOh I\u2018m sorry, were you looking for a review for this particular song only? Well, let me tell you, this is the shortest track on the album and I still think half of the shit here is unnecessary; at least when it comes to the drum rolls/fills. It actually opens with one of the better riffs on the album (not that it\u2019s any big deal) but as soon as the drums come in its back to being regular crap. The vocal lines in the chorus actually bring a groovy feel to the whole song, of course, this is not a positive remark, it is to signify the fact that they still haven\u2019t been able to get rid of the nu-metal sound they developed during their last masterpiece. Try substituting the lyrics from any hip-hop song and tell me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nThe production; oh god! The vocals and drums will just get on your nerves and will make you reduce the volume, whether you\u2019re a kvlt black metal guy or a simple rock n\u2019 roll dude. While the production IS suck-ass too, no matter how good a producer might be, he cannot make horrible material like this sound like any of the band\u2019s early stuff.\n\nMoving on, let\u2019s talk about the solo. I really have no words to describe what Kirk Hammett has turned into after all these years. He was never an exceptionally great player, but here he has just reached the mark of being utterly unbearable.\n\nIt\u2019s about time this band stops being so complacent and try to focus on their work. While this junk can impress some blind worshippers, it certainly cannot get the attention of those people who they disappointed after they sold out in the worst possible manner.\n",
        "\nNow this would be one of the worst tracks from the shitty album Metallica very recently came up with. A bunch of amateur school kids jamming in their garage sound better than this! Rick Rubin is really trying hard to make the drums sound like they did on And Justice for All and failing miserably. The vocal performance is completely worn out, sick and tired, like an 80 year old man is angry and is trying his best to scold/scare you. \n\nKirk Hammett; I don\u2019t know why this guy is in the band. No, wait; I don\u2019t know why this guy hasn\u2019t stopped playing the guitar. The blind shredding he has done here is just EXCRUTIATING to listen to. Trust me; my fingers were on my ears during the solos of all the songs, including this one. I truly believe that of ALL the bands I listen to, Kirk Hammett has climbed the spot and become the WORST guitarist in my book. \n\nThe song really doesn\u2019t leave much to talk about, just like any other one on the album, it is filled with a couple of hoary riffs, a lousy solo, bass which is not audible and Lars\u2019 signature trash can drums. Overall, it is still quite shoddy and far from appraisable. \n\nI just don\u2019t know why they even try anymore. They\u2019ve been disappointing their fans right since the early nineties. What\u2019s even more astonishing is that a lot of their fans still have hope. Sheesh, I pity them.\n",
        "\nAfter getting sick & tired of listening to Metallica, it\u2019s blind worshippers & the people Metallica hired to praise the album before it\u2019s release go ga ga over it, I decided I\u2019d give it a try. The hype surround this album itself was pathetic, I became curious to know how pathetic the album would be. They tried everything, didn\u2019t they? After the \u201cnew song\u201d they performed on stage turned out to be a piece of shit, they said it won\u2019t be able to make it to the album. They pushed the release date a million times, they released the track listing, then the length, then the artwork, then a single, then another single only to be followed by two more, then samples of all songs\u2026and then finally, despite all precautions, the album leaked through some French store, otherwise who knows they might have released the whole album in singles. \n\nAnyway, this is one of those singles. The Judas Kiss, which is no different from the other songs on the album. The production sucks, all I can hear is drums and vocals, the bass is far from audible. But are they really to blame when the material itself is so bad? We have some generic power chord crap, typical \"yea-yeaish\" vocals from James and that trash can beat, again, something the band has a degree in. This crap goes on till about 4:40 after which Kirk enters and delivers a solo a so poorly written and so badly played that it won\u2019t impress even the average noob walking on the street, let alone some fairly knowledgeable metalhead.\n",
        "\nUsually I would draw a few lines about Metallica\u00b4s career, their former succesful abums, musical change, controversies (the usual clich\u00e9) but since I see that stuff in almost every music review I\u00b4m gonna cut the crap and go straight to the topic. Metallica\u00b4s 6th studio album has just been released (only for the purposes of this review, for actually we are nearing the end of 2008) and after having produced their self-titled album it\u00b4s obvious which horse they\u00b4ve chosen to ride. Expectations were high (as for every Metallica release), so how did this one come out?\n\nPretty good, actually. They\u00b4ve modified their sound a bit again and while the Black Album still had some metal elements, Load is pure hard rock from start to finish, with a distinctive blues/jazz feel. Yeah, you hear me. Grab this CD, enter you car and have a ride of your life. You won\u00b4t regret it.\n\nLoad is literally LOADed with excellent songs. The guitars have a nice, hard and full sound, which is a little overused, but works perfectly. This is one of the main things why I like the album so much. It\u00b4s rock, it\u00b4s quite hard, but not so heavy, compared to Master Of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. The songs are simpler than those of their thrash era, but don\u00b4t sound repetitive or boring at all. It\u00b4s a nice change, concentrating on the songs to work well for the listeners, and not just pumping riff after riff, solo after solo. The riffs are damn catchy. Hammet does a big amount of wah soloing on the album, which is very nice, and fits the music lovely. Hetfield\u00b4s job at rhythm guitar is simply flawless. Lars\u00b4s drumming is nothing spectacular, but on the songs like \"Bleeding Me\" really shines. The problem with the inaudibility of the bass seems to be finally solved as Newstead\u00b4s bass lines can be heard very well throughout the whole album. The vocal performance is nothing short of excellent and James really outdid himself here, bringing variety, passion and tenderness (!) to his voice, thus making the vocals one of the main highlights of the album, which was never Metallica\u00b4s strong point. As for the lyrics, they finally don\u00b4t deal with stuff like death or God or whatever, replacing it with issues like drug addiction or even a song about Hetfield\u00b4s mother. A weird combination, but it works. The production overall is top-notch, every instrument is clean as ever. The songs are also pretty consistent, almost every track can be described as \u201egood\u201c or \u201every good\u201c. This was a problem with the Black Album, of which several songs were amazing, but the rest sucked bigtime. Metallica didn\u00b4t make any room for those kinds of errors on Load, so no skipping tracks, save one, this time.\n\nThe album kicks off with \"Ain\u00b4t My Bitch\", and what an opener it is! It starts with a brief one-guitar riff and then the bass and drums enter the place. Hetfield\u00b4s singing is easy-going (something that we weren\u00b4t used to) yet possessing that harshness he\u00b4s known for. A great chorus and a nice slide solo by Hammet. This song perfectly sets the mood for the rest of the album. After that comes \"2x4\", which sucks in my opinion. Uninspiring and boring. Thank God the rest of the package makes up for this song. \"The House Jack Built\" is one of the singles released before the release of the actual album (along with \"Until It Sleeps\"). It\u00b4s just plain creepy. It contains a nice weird-sounding pedal solo, and the verse is pure tension. But, a good song, one of the better. Other splendid tracks are \"King Nothing\", \"Cure\" (a real headbanger) and the chillout song \"Mama Said\". It has some pretty good acoustic guitar work and the whole song is a nice ballad. \"Hero Of The Day\" is in it\u00b4s tempo very similar to the aforementioned track, only a bit faster and heavier. The \"Outlaw Torn\" is the longest track on the album, and one of the best. Nice vocals, catchy main riff, amazing guitar work at the end. But the best song on the album, and easily one of the best songs ever written by Metallica is the monstrously epic \"Bleeding Me\", 8 minutes of sheer hard rock orgasm. It begins with some nice touches from the guitarist, and the Hetfield sings (really sings!) the beautiful words \u201eI\u00b4m digging my way...\u201c, followed by a nice falsetto. A superb riff forms the chorus, without any vocals. The formula repeats again, then comes the solo, then an agonizing guitar work, then the chorus once more, Lars accelerates, and... massive slowdown. The instruments fade, and after a wee silence a single guitar riff kicks back, followed by the others. Then comes the last chorus, Lars and the guitars are at full speed and echoing are the words \u201eI CAN\u00b4T TAKE IT!\u201c In this part, Hetfield doesn\u00b4t scream or shout the words, he fuc*ing BELLOWS them, with such force that would make even Peavy Wagner crouch in the corner. The spine-chilling continues as Hammet immediately unleashes a long wah solo. The song comes to an end as everything slows down and the initial verse is being repeated one last time. Masterpiece and an instant classic.\n\nThis album simply kicks ass. It has superb riffs, some breathtaking vocals, solid drumming, nice solos and a wide variety of songs, most of them excellent. It\u00b4s not metal, nor I see a reason why it has to be, and newbies or fans of good hard rock as well as metalheads shouldn\u00b4t omit this release. Actually, I place Load on the second spot in my most favourite albums by Metallica, right after Master Of Puppets, and that is a hell of an argument for listeners to try out this album.\n",
        "\nWhether or not you will like Death Magnetic depends heavily on what kind of metal head you are. For instance, if you think Metallica has not released a good album since Ride the Lightning, this album will only reinforce that conviction. (Same applies for people who think that Master of Puppets was Metallica's last good album.)\n\nLet me break it down: If you like everything up to and including ...And Justice For All but nothing else, you probably won't like this album very much. However, if you love everything up to and including ...And Justice For All, and think that the Black Album is OK, but nothing special (like I do), and think everything else is garbage, odds are you will kinda sorta think that Death Magnetic is OK. If you only liked Load and ReLoad, this might be OK, but it's probably too heavy for you. If you liked St. Anger...I don't really know what you were thinking. In the end, the only type of Metallica fan this album will truly please is the die-hard one, the kind that will worship whatever the band does (maybe with the exception of St. Anger) no matter what that may be. Fans who have already been alienated probably still won't be changing their minds any time soon, although this album does seem to be creating some buzz.\n\nBut let's put aside what we already think of Metallica and review the album for what it is: a piece of music. And for what it is, Death Magnetic is decent. It's definitely not thrash, as many fanboys like to claim. It is definitely NOT a return to thrash. It's heavy metal at best, hard rock at worst, and only very occasionally devolving into St. Anger-like confused riffing (I'm looking at you, My Apocalypse).\n\nBefore I get into any specifics about the music, I would like to point something out about the production. It's terrible. At least one aspect of it. At first I thought it was a lame attempt to sound raw (I had heard that they cut this album to tape like the old days, instead of using Pro Tools), but I found out that it was really a lame attempt to sound loud. Apparently there has been a war going on in the music industry to produce the \"loudest\" album. So, yes, all of the tracks on Death Magnetic have been brick walled to the point of distortion, occasionally getting very annoying, and it definitely reduces the audio quality a great deal. It is especially noticeable on the drums.\n\nNow let's get to the music. Much to my relief, Hammett's solos are back, and most of them are very good. Some of them go on a bit too long, and recycle a bit too much, but for the most part they add a nice touch to the songs.\n\nThe problem with most of the songs is that they sound forced. It's obvious that Metallica wanted to make a return to their glory days, but just couldn't. Many of the riffs are reminiscent of old ones, not in a good way, but in a that sounds a little too familiar way; indeed the entire song \"The Day That Never Comes\" sounds as if the band tried to rewrite \"One\" (albeit more in structure than riffage, with only one blatantly obvious self-plagiarizing riff). The song is actually a highlight of the album, as it would turn out. The second rhythm riff sounds like it could have been the child of \"Fade to Black\", although the song should have ended a little sooner, with the end soloing/instrumental part dragging on too long for it's own good. \n\nMost of the songs are good for an occasional listen, but I don't think I'll be going back to them as often as I will to Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. \"The Unforgiven III\" is strangely unsimilar to either of the previous Unforgiven songs, the only commonality being the heavy verse/clean chorus song structure.\n\nI was excited when I learned that an instrumental track would make an appearance on Death Magnetic, something the band hadn't done since 1988. I was ultimately disappointed, however. \"Suicide & Redemption\" isn't a bad song, but it doesn't capture the intensity or complexity of \"To Live Is to Die\", \"Orion\", or \"The Call of Ktulu\". \"Suicide & Redemption\" sounds like more of a jam, which is nice in that it is fairly progressive in some ways, but not polished enough to live up to its predecessors.\n\nJames Hetfield's vocals leave much to be desired. His affection for a more melodic singing style remains, and just doesn't fit the musical style or lyrics. I don't think anyone ever thought Hetfield was a good singer, but he used to be a very good vocalist. The growls that can even be found on most of the tracks on the Black Album would have suited this album much more. The lyrics are even worse, often ridiculous. Too often brutal for the sake of brutal. While singing about mangled flesh and rotting corpses might have suited Slayer, the lyrical themes just don't go well with Metallica now, and never would have.\n\nReally, though, none of that matters. Unless you are new to Metallica, you probably knew what you were going to think of this album before you bought it, didn't you? Such is the way of fans. Neither extreme of opinion is really right. It's not terrible, and it's not a return to thrash metal godliness. It's pretty good music but it's not really good metal. It's not a step in the right or wrong direction, it's just a step in a direction. And since it doesn't compare to anything else they've put out before, what it really boils down to is whether or not you like this new direction.\n",
        "\nMetallica\u2019s newest record, Death Magnetic, is a rip-roaring return to classic form, and re-establishes the band as the reighning kings of commercial Heavy Metal. Impressive guitar work, progressive song structures, and lyrics dealing with themes of death and redemption are elements that echo the late 80\u2019s \u2018golden\u2019 era of Metallica. Specifically the progressive thrash classic \u2018\u2026And Justice For All\u201d. \n\nSince their landmark commercial smash \u201cThe Black Album\u201d in 1991, Metallica have been caught in a creative and popular decline that has lasted over a decade. This trend reached its climax with the disastrous St. Anger in 2003 and the release of an all- too revealing documentary titled \u2018Some Kind Of Monster\u2019 in 2004.\n\nIn The years since, old school metal has experienced a major resurgence in popularity. This can be attributed to the appeal of bands such as Avenged Sevenfold and Trivium, both of whom consider Metallica to be their biggest influence. Another factor in this phenomenon are the video games Guitar Hero and Rock Band, who introduce hordes of new fans to the music of hard rock and metal bands everyday.\n\nThe public\u2019s newfound interest in heavy metal prompted Metallica to dig themselves out of the creative grave and redeem themselves with a record that brings new life to the monster. In September 2008, they released the incredible \u2018Death Magnetic\u2019. Tracks such as \u2018That Was Just Your Life\u2019, The Judas Kiss\u2019, and the album\u2019s frantic closer \u2018My Apocalypse\u2019 are all evidence that Metallica still possess the thrash metal chops that made their first three albums masterpieces within the genre. \u2018Cyanide\u2019 and \u2018The End Of The Line\u2019 are a bit more mellow and rocking songs, but are just as effective and memorable, having melodic and fluid verses that flow into catchy choruses that sound larger than life.\n\nPerhaps the greatest song on the album is the incredible ballad \u2018The Day That Never Comes\u2019. Beginning with a touching vocal line and lyrics dealing with lead singer and guitarist James Hetfield\u2019s troubled youth, the song picks up near the end, before evolving into an all out assault complete with an impressive guitar solo from lead Guitarist Kirk Hammet. The song is similar to their grammy award winning epic \u2018one\u2019, which appeared on \u201d..And Justice For All\u201d.\n\nThe album isn\u2019t without its flaws though. \u2018The Unforgiven III\u2019, while not a terrible song, doesn\u2019t quite live up to the power and beauty of its predecessors, \u2018Unforgiven\u2019 and \u2018Unforgiven II\u2019. \u2018Suicide and Redemption\u2019 is a ten-minute long instrumental that seems overlong and plodding in some areas, but still features marvelous guitar playing from James and Kirk.\n\nRedemption plays an important part in the lyrical and musical themes of this record. The advertisements promised Death Magnetic to be \u2018The Return Of Metallica\u2019, the record that would rescue Metallica from the grave they dug themselves into over the years. That\u2019s exactly what this record represents, the redemption of Metallica, the rebirth of their creativity, and the hope for new life and music to continue in the future.\n\nOverall, Death Magnetic is an exhilarating dose of Metal that seems custom fit for the changing culture of the new millennium. It is the true return to form the fans have been waiting for, complete with thoughtful lyrics, riffs, and actual guitar solos. With a running time of 75 minutes, this record reveals new secrets with every listen, and never grows dull or old. With a North American tour planned for this winter, the future seems bright for Metallica, fans can only hope it doesn\u2019t take another five years to produce a follow up.\n",
        "\nFinding the scratched to hell cover and damaged single case (whatever they're called) of this a few months ago made me a lot happier then I should've been. Memories of being floored by this song on rage (Australian music video show, like MTV or whatever) when I was 10 came back; it's hardly the greatest song or single ever and features possibly the low point of Metallica's career, but alternatively it was the gateway to a whole new world of music, and it has the extended version of Outlaw Torn.\n\nThe title track/A side isn't too bad, basically a sign of what went wrong with the rockier Load/Reload tunes. The vocals are great and it's catchy as all hell, but the riffs are limp and the whole thing doesn't really have a lot in the way of balls and energy. At the time this was possibly the heaviest thing ever, however time has revealed that perhaps that isn't quite the case.\n\nAnyway, the low point in Metallica's career, the tepid remix of King Nothing. To their credit it's not on an album, regardless it still blows hard. Horrible drum machines, terrible synths, a song that's not particularly good to begin with; it's awful on an unbelievable level. St.Anger sounds like Beethoven compared to this. Horrible, on every level.\n\nThings are made a fair bit by the monster that is the full version of Outlaw Torn. The huge opening and main riff; the bass lines and soaring chorus; an amazing tune that I'm hoping one day gets the revisionist touch and ends up being counted as one of Metallica's best tunes. The build into the solo is some of the best stuff Metallica have done; it'd be sweet if they stopped trying to go back to their roots (even though the latest effort worked rather well) and released a bunch of long, strange epics along the lines of this one. The whole \"extended\" thing doesn't mean a good deal, just that the noodling at the end gets extended a fair bit.\n\nIf you're a Metallica fanatic it's probably worth tracking this down (and maybe the \"first part\", too) because it's got some relatively rare stuff; shame the newest singles don't have anything like this. Anyway, a decent single with 1 ok song, 1 shit song and a huge sort of epic thing; I certainly don't regret buying it back in the day, and if I saw it cheap I'd probably snap it up again.\n",
        "\nUnearthing these old Metallica singles of mine is always a real trip down memory lane; when I was a poor young lad in year 7 with not enough money to buy full lengths, buying whatever single I could and just playing the absolute crap out of them, taping them for friends and swapping them round. A great time that I will fully admit gives me a very rose tinted look at this single.\n\nA lot of people really hate this Turn the Page cover; I don't think it's that bad. It's an enjoyable enough hard rock song that's catchy and has a pretty decent vocal performance, it's all fairly drawn out and compared to what Metallica had done in the past it's not that great, sure, but whatever. Memories of skating and bodyboarding and underage drinking (back when you only needed two beers to get smashed!) all the time mean that I will always really enjoy this song, far, far more then I should.\n\nThe live tracks are really good, though. Bleeding Me's always been a favourite of mine; a long, relaxed intro giving way to the most metal part of Load and a rather sweet solo. I've always been a fan of Hetfield's live vocals from the Load era, and that combined with the solid riffing and huge chorus means this is a pretty satisfying song. \n\nThere's two covers here that I also have a real boner for; for one thing both \"Stone Cold Crazy\" and \"The Wait\" were just incredibly heavy for my young and innocent mind back in the day. Stone's a real fast tune and it's always surprised me that it's a Queen cover, lyrically it's kinda badass and the riffs are fast and furious. A great tune, no doubt. \"The Wait\" has a great intro; real doomy and heavy (and something that always made my mum go \"this is noise, turn it off!\", good times). Otherwise it's just a simple freight train of a song with a massive chorus and huge mid tempo riffs, though James overdoes his \"-na\" stylings a bit too much in this. As with most live Metallica the production is pretty good, a bit bass heavy but raw and clear.\n\nSure it's not the best thing ever but, y'know, nostalgia and stuff. The live stuff is pretty cool and as far as hard rock goes the cover of Turn the Page could certainly be a fair bit worse. I'll be keeping my copy and giving it a spin while sighing and feeling all wistful for a while, methinks.\n",
        "\n\u201cCyanide\u201d is one of the slowest songs of the new Metallica album and, while not being as interesting as some songs out of the same album (like \u201cThat Was Just your Life\u201d or \u201cSuicide and Redemption\u201d), still is a quite good track, carrying a sound similar to some of the Black Album/Load tunes, as opposed to the strong ...And Justice for All influences displayed on the rest of the record. Quite midpaced and groovy, this tune is clearly driven by the bass work of Mr. Robert Trujillo, who pulls out some interesting, albeit somewhat simple, bass licks and lines.\n\nSo, \u201cCyanide\u201d begins with Lars Ulrich smashing the tons and cymbals, with the rest of the band accompanying him with some rather generic riffs. After this little intro, a quite groovy bass line kicks in, leading us to the main guitar riff. Now, as you can see I'm always kind of classifying this song as a groovy one and, while I generally hate groove metal, I have to say that it's the groove that makes this song what it really is. When you play a midpaced song, you got to have a nice set of guitar riffs OR some groovy bass lines to avoid the track to turn into an authentic snooze-fest. This song fits in the latter category, being the only true bass-driven song composed by this band since Cliff Burton passed away (or \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d was released).\n\nThe chorus is fortunately very catchy and addictive and after the first section of the track, there is a little transition segment, leading us to a nice, slower middle section, filled with, again, the groovy bass and some clean guitar melodies. It kind of reminds me of the middle sections of some songs out of their debut, like \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d or \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d: both contained very melodic parts and this tune clearly follows the same path. The climax of \u201cCyanide\u201d can be found on the solo, which is comparable to a descending storm, first it's slow and then becoming faster and faster and rawer and rawer. The solo part stands out even more if we compare it to the slow/mid pace the rest of the tune delves in.\n\nHetfield's vocals sound much better on this kind of tunes, where he doesn't need to sound that aggressive nor emotional, and he shines here too. Finally, Lars delivers a simplistic (as usual) performance, but still appropriate. Another fine new Metallica tune, albeit not very flashy or original.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the fast solo.\n",
        "\nMathematics has been something of a curiosity for me, particularly statistics, as it is a useful tool in measuring the consequences of just about any situation. When applied to the huge buildup in anticipation of Metallica\u2019s alleged return to form \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d, the third single preceding the album yields that results are fairly consistent with the last two. We\u2019ve received an overlong, meandering ballad, and also a poorly produced though passable thrash song, so naturally in order to keep the predicted result of a release suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder attempting to please every member of the band\u2019s fan base, we\u2019d need a certified half-thrash fit of groove metal idiocy, complete with all the trappings that made most popular metal music from 1992 to 1996 suck something awful. \n\nIf I could sum this song up in a single phrase, it would go something along the lines of a complete waste of talent. It perplexes the mind that Metallica went through all of that hoopla looking for a suitable replacement for Jason Newsted, ended up picking a solid finger plucking virtuoso like Robert Trujillo, only to have him banging out one note grooves that makes the bass line to \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d sound intricate. Pile on two or three dumb assed mid-tempo guitar grooves, some chugging sections that attempt to sound like a revisiting of \u201cSeek And Destroy\u201d, and Lars still jacking up that snare drum so damned loud that can\u2019t hear the bass and can only half hear the guitars, and you\u2019ve got something along the lines of a slightly more energetic song from \u201cLoad\u201d.\n\nLike all of the better songs in this style in the Machine Head and later Pantera tradition, a little less than half of the song is actually pretty descent, despite its primitive tribal nature. The principle riff is actually not too bad, sounding like a slower variation of a Motorhead song, but it\u2019s followed by this annoying as hell two note groove that repeats 6 or 8 times. The buildup to the solo section also flows well, though the drums get even more overpowering, and leads to a fairly good solo. In the past James\u2019 riffs were the primary thing carrying the band, but it seems now that Kirk is basically the only thing keeping this from being 100% trite, and it\u2019s also good to see that he\u2019s 3 for 3 now on soloing well without the need of the wah pedal constantly blaring.\n\nDespite the fact that this is basically a groove metal song, it\u2019d be fairly enjoyable if the band tweaked the mixing and overall production to give the song some atmosphere. In some respects you could say that \u201cFor Whom The Bell Tolls\u201d has some groove elements, but the overall simplicity of the song was bolstered by this arena-like atmosphere, which you don\u2019t get on here. Everything literally sounds like it is being played in somebody\u2019s bedroom, something which even some bedroom black metal projects tend to avoid with reverb usage. Most of this is due to the dead sounding, yet unsurprisingly loud as hell drums, though James\u2019 vocals are also a little hollow sounding.\n\nOther than maybe your occasional impulsive shopper or diehard Metallica cultist, there\u2019s little point in picking this up. I\u2019d like to think that I only didn\u2019t like this song because it was featured at Ozzfest, but this is really not up to par with all the hype that\u2019s being generated. Sometimes hype can actually lead people into purchasing music that they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t spend money on, which is precisely what happened on the last studio album. And just like \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, there will likely be a good amount of disappointed fans afterwards, all of who were hoping for the real return to the band\u2019s roots that they believed would happened.\n",
        "\n\u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d probably is the rawest and heardest track featured on Death Magnetic: Metallica definitely tried to create a song similar to thrash classics like \u201cBattery\u201d or \u201cDyers Eve\u201d. In the end, this tune turns out to be pretty good but certainly not an instant classic like those two before-mentioned songs.\n\nStructure-wise, \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d is very well crafted: the transitions between the riffs are excellent and, about the riffs, there are plenty of good ones to be found on this track. Despite being the simplest song out of Death Magnetic, \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d still has a good number of them, always played at a very very fast tempo. The first two minutes are dominated by one riff, which is quite simple, almost punk-ish, and not the best choice for a main riff because it just really pales in comparison to the riffs that come next... Like the one kicking in at around the 2 minutes mark. Oh well, that's a pretty good riff, very similar to the guitar playing on Vio-Lence's Eternal Nightmare.\n\nBut oh well, a good song isn't only made by riffs. The vocal melodies and overall vocal performance are quite decent, but James Hetfield can't sound as aggressive now as he could during the 80's, unfortunately. At times, it's like he's trying too damn hard to sound menacing and the result is a so-so performance. As for Lars Ulrich, he's not the best drummer in the world, everybody knows that, and his playing is, nowadays, quite sloppy. Still, and while sounding a bit too repetitive, his beats fit the song well, all of them being quite fast. Kirk, unfortunately, doesn't steal the show with his solo and lead playing, because this song is clearly focused on the riffs played by Hetfield, but, oh well, I guess his solo is good, all in all, despite being a bit too, ah, mellow... I don't know, but everytime I listen to it, I just wish the guy pulled out the thing faster and with more attitude, he plays the solo too damn slow, which kills the \u201cheadbanging atmosphere\u201d created when Hetfield screams \u201cSpit it out!\u201d. I just wish that the solo was faster, really.\n\nSo, this song contain some interesting riffs and it is fairly well written but it still lacks the sheer energy one can find on old Metallica tunes like \u201cWhiplash\u201d, \u201cDyers Eve\u201d or \u201cDamage Inc.\u201d. Still, this is the most aggressive song featured on Death Magnetic and, quite possibly, the closer Metallica ever was (and probably will ever be) to recapture the band's old spirit.\n\nBest Moments of the Song:\n-the part where James screams \u201cGo\u201d and that catchy riff is unleashed.\n-the melodic riff played after the solo.\n",
        "\nOk now, there is no need for anyone to explain Metallica's history here since it's a story that every metalhead should know. And by this time I'd say a good 80% of the metal community has listened to the three singles released from their new album Death Magnetic. From those three singles we have one shitty alternative rock song that sounds like Trivium and Creed collaborated to make a song, then we have a groove/post thrash song that shows us some of Trujillo's bass work, and then we have this song, the thrasher of the album. Or at least that's what it looks like so far.\n\nSo yeah this looks like the thrashiest song that there will be on the album. Pounding drums, fast guitar, aggressive vocals, and the bass. Wait what? You can't here the bass? ? Where the hell is Trujillo in this song? I was really looking forward to him playing in a full out thrash song but god dammit he isn't here. But besides from the absence of the bass guitar, something else is still missing in here. I don't know quite what it is but I'm not getting the same feeling that I do when I usually listen to Metallica\u2019s thrashier songs, or just about anything from their first three albums. And quite frankly I just don\u2019t understand it. The riffing in here is very aggressive and reminiscent of older Metallica using the triplets and sliding power chords. (Battery anyone) Then we have Lar$ coming in with a pretty catchy intro that soon explodes into the thrasher of a song that this is. As soon as the main riff comes in I immediately find myself headbanging. Hell it\u2019s a catchy riff.\nThank the gods that Lar$ doesn\u2019t have his snare in that atrocious tuning that he had it in for St. Anger. The riff change at 1:50 offers some diversity and brings on even more thrashing to the song. James is sounding better than usual, maybe this can be half accredited to the lyrics, Good ole Metallica, singing about the end of the world once more. Because I found his voice to still be very irritating on the other two singles but it looks like he pulled his act together here and delivers some nice low, and gruff styled vocals. Of course don\u2019t expect anything like off of Kill \u2018em All with James having a high pitch scream and then bringing his voice down real low too. Then we\u2019re treated to some wah wah free soloing which is decent at best but whatever it fits the over all feeling of the song. \n\nWith all this good stuff in this song it seems like I should\u2019ve given this a bit higher than an 75%. And no doubt, this is a good song, but like I said before something is still missing. And I think I finally figured it out after about a week of writing this review. What\u2019s missing you ask? Well here I\u2019ll tell you plain and simple what\u2019s missing here, the passion. That fiery rage that filled the minds and souls of the young Metallica. In this song it just feels like they\u2019re going through the parts without any real energy here. Like they only did this song to please some of their older fanbase, not because they just felt like thrashing again. Why do I get this feeling about their new album? From those three singles already released, The Day That Never Comes is obviously targeted at the fans who like Load and Re-Load and that fat 13 year old who like One from Guitar Hero. Cyanide is more from the Black Album era and is targeted at the kids who think that the Black Album and that Enter Sandman were the best material Metallica ever put out. And then there is My Apocalypse which is focused on the older crowd of Metallica fans, the one\u2019s who thrash and rage to those first three albums daily. The one\u2019s who would\u2019ve done anything to have a beer with Metallica.\n\nNow there is no doubt that this is probably one of the best songs off of Death Magnetic, and I\u2019ll defend it as that. But to actually think that this is anything close to their earlier works is pure madness. If you think that you\u2019ve probably never gotten the same feeling that most of us have experienced while listening to those crazy motherfuckers known as Metallica.\n",
        "\nThey might have to considering rewording that classic clich\u00e9 to being 4 times the charm, because that seems to be the order of the day here. With three singles out that all suggest an inconsistent album on the way, this seems to be some sort of life-line that may actually make this album worth seeking out, for hope that there might be more where this came from. For all of you anxious Metallica fans out there who behaved yourselves and didn\u2019t download the leaked album and singles, \u201cThe Judas Kiss\u201d is probably the first place you\u2019d want to go if you plan on blowing money on a single.\n\nPicture the better songs off of the \u201cSelf-Titled\u201d album being put into one exciting upper mid-tempo thrasher with a little dose of \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d epic soloing and you\u2019ve got the rough idea. Surprisingly enough, this is also a song where one of the biggest positives is Hetfield\u2019s voice. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s been trying too hard to sound clean and serious on the ballads and a little too careful on the rougher parts on the previous songs, but here he\u2019s thrown his inhibitions aside and actually pulled something off that\u2019s in line with the material before the \u201cLoad\u201d craze.\n\nAlthough the song still suffers from a mostly dead drum sound, the riffs are able to punch through and rule the entirety of the song. Sometimes there are impressions of the harmonic guitar lines of \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d and early works, but the overall atmosphere and the riff assault is like a slightly faster, albeit not as well produced version of \u201cThrough The Never\u201d. Things get nice and speedy during Kirk\u2019s guitar solo, which sees him on the wah pedal for the whole duration, although putting forth something that still sounds more alive than what he\u2019s done in the past 22 years. If he keeps the ratio of wah pedal to straight tone soloing that is suggested in the four cumulative singles, he will successfully freed himself from more than 2 decades of wah abuse, something I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d see.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty safe bet that most songs that are released as singles by a thrash band are not well representative of the album, and with this single it may actually be safe to assume that the band considers themselves just that and have an album that is worth the money. In the past, the singles have been the highlights of Metallica\u2019s releases, particularly in the mid to late 90s. But this seems to indicate that there is more yet to be discovered, and hopefully it\u2019ll be enough to cancel out the misfires they\u2019ve already revealed. I\u2019m still not happy with the drum production on here, but that\u2019s basically all that\u2019s holding these guys back here.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on September 8, 2008.\n",
        "\nIt seems that my initial suspicions about the nature of \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d were correct. Not only does this song signify a definite attempt at trying to please everyone, but it actually goes as far as to emphasize the thrash element throughout at least one entire song, if not more. Now this in itself doesn\u2019t specifically suggest that the song itself is bad, though it definitely suggests a level of confusion in the band\u2019s own identity, which will ultimately impact the quality of the entire album when it is released. First we\u2019re given an all out groove offering in \u201cCyanide\u201d, then a half-assed ballad turned thrash tune in \u201cThe Day That Never Comes\u201d, and now \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d comes with riffs packing and speed blazing to convince us that the same band that gave us \u201cDyer\u2019s Eve\u201d and \u201cBattery\u201d still hasn\u2019t died yet. Can you guys make up your fucking minds please?\n\nI will grant the band this, \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d is definitely a thrash song and a breath of fresh air after more than a decade of pop culture pandering, but it is not what I\u2019d call a certified classic. The intro sounds almost like a punk oriented crossover riff, but when the song gets going what emerges is something along the lines of \u201cBattery\u201d with a slight Cro Mags feel. It gets a little repetitive after a while, but at around the 1:52 mark they throw in this riff that sounds very similar to something I heard on Vio-Lence\u2019s debut. From here on in the song basically goes on unrelenting save a small breakdown right before the chorus, which recurs a few times and doesn\u2019t really diminish the energy too much. Kirk plays a nice brief solo, which again avoids wah pedal usage and displays a nice mellow tone that is a little bit removed from the rage venting that he used to exhibit.\n\nThe main thing that holds this song back is the mixing job and James\u2019 semi-aggressive vocals. I can tell that despite what sounds like a sincere attempt at sounding aggressive, Hetfield just isn\u2019t quite getting the job done the way he used to. Sometimes his shouts sound out of tune, and at other times he simply sounds like he\u2019s simply raising his voice for a waiter to take his order from the other side of a crowded room. This stands in contrast with older material where his voice exhibited that classic gravely growl tone that is more up close and personal. It\u2019s something of a paradox actually, because the primary problem with the mixing of the instruments on here is that the whole thing sounds like it is being done in a small, insulated room, and that you\u2019re literally in the studio listening to them. There\u2019s no reverb, no sustain, everything just dies almost immediately after the attack. In the 80s thrash bands used to augment their recordings with reverb to simulate the large atmosphere of a full fledged concert, something which modern production practices have all but destroyed in mainstream rock music nowadays.\n\nNow naturally even with the lack of dimensional depth to the production, there is also the continuing problem with the timbre of the instruments. Lars has at least gotten the bass drum to sound close to the thudding, thunderous goodness of the old days, but the cymbals are still tinny sounding and the snare is popping rather than punching. There\u2019s a nifty little gadget called a compressor which would likely cure the former, while the latter calls for a tuning key and an ear that is interested in hearing something other than Stomp-style percussive gibberish. The guitars could also use a little more distortion and maybe have the middle bumped up a bit. Basically there is nothing wrong with the song itself; the lyrics are plenty morose, the riffs are in order, and the total presentation is definitely head bang worthy.\n\nAll in all, you could do worse than this song, a lot worse. This might be the best thing that \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d has to offer, which is a huge step up from the Load albums. The problem is that I don\u2019t want to look at a song in regards to everything out there that could be or is worse, I want to listen to a Metallica song and say \u201cthis kicks ass, I doubt there is much that is better than this\u201d, and I don\u2019t get that with this. I get adequate to enjoyable, but I don\u2019t get that rush of euphoria that I get with \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d or \u201cKill Em\u2019 All\u201d, let alone all the amazing stuff that came out of both New York and the San Francisco Bay Area during the 80s. If this is the best thing that Metallica has to offer, you\u2019d be better off throwing your money at Testament\u2019s \u201cFormation Of Damnation\u201d, which is a lot closer to the good old days of Thrash mayhem that this pretends to be.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on September 8, 2008.\n",
        "\n\u201cJudas Kiss\u201d is the fourth and last single off of \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d and was released on 8th August, just four days before the scheduled release of the album itself.\n\nRemember, way back in August the band released a small two-minute video in promotion of the new album? It had nearly 10 seconds of new stuff in it, which included a new riff and the words \u201cBow down, sell your soul to me, I will set you free\u201d. If you have been following the band like crazy for the past few months then you probably will. This is the track, the part of whose extremely catchy chorus is just what I mentioned a few lines back.\n\nAs for the track it is eight minutes of signature Metallica heaviness. It starts of with a heavy riff and ends on a high note too. No slow or melodic sections here. It features epic soloing in the form of two long solos both by Kirk himself. Lars\u2019s performance here is mentionable too, and this time not for the wrong reasons. He plays good drums, nothing extra ordinary, just good paced and well timed beats. Rob\u2019s bass is as audible and meaty as is on the album and in my opinion of all the tracks we\u2019ve heard till now James sounds the best on this track. As I earlier mentioned the stand out thing here is the epic chorus a snippet of which we heard as long as five months back.\n\nIf the earlier singles made me believe that the band good make a good comeback into the music industry this only concreted it. Looking forward (now even more anxiously, thanks to this single) for the release of the album on which it will feature.\n",

The album was described as a missing link between \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d and the ever-famous self-titled album. This track proves why.\n\n\u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d is a track, which takes us way back into the early thrash days of the band. Clocking in at just over five minutes the track starts off with this amazingly catchy and thrashy riff, which only solidifies the fact that the band really have dug deep into the bag of tricks which dates back way back in the early 80\u2019s. The drums soon follow and for the first time since quite a long time Lars\u2019 has really impressed me. Accompanying the riffs the drums play a crucial part of the track and after quite a long time Lars decides not to play second fiddle when it comes to playing tracks.\n\nThe track is insanely fast and thrashy with the highlights being the chorus and this solo by Kirk near the 2:30 min mark. This solo is excellently well played and if it actually is Kirk that elevates the status of the track altogether. Rob Trujillo, just like in the two new tracks that had been heard before plays bass that is both well played and audible. James\u2019 voice is better than what we heard on St. Anger but not as good as was on \u201cThe Day That Never Comes\u201d, and yeah, guys, please give this guy a break for God\u2019s sake. Stop comparing his vocals to what he sounded as on \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d and \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d. That was a whole 20 plus years back, you expect him to sound the same even NOW?\n\nHowever on the negative side there are a few points as well. The drums are great but only during the first 30 seconds of the song. After that Lars\u2019 playing is not up to the standard he himself has laid. Also there are these 2 parts of the track, which would have been better if not played at all. The first is when the band ups the tempo near the 30-second mark. Lars\u2019 drums, James\u2019 voice all sound terribly bad after the wonderful intro they provided. The second weak part is the last verse, which acts as the base for the 35-second outro for the track. This too would have been better if left out.\n\nJames said before making this album that he and the band were trying to get into the mindset they were in during the bands\u2019 early albums. If not James or Lars, Kirk Hammett is definitely in that mindset. His solo, the speed of which reminds me of the solo he played on \u201cWhiplash\u201d is for me the highlight of the album. If those two weak parts weren\u2019t there on this track I\u2019d rate it higher.\n",
        "\nMetallica's \"Death Magnetic\" was always going to be one of the hottest topics in metal - even in music in general - of 2008. After the roundly-criticised \"St Anger\", there were legitimate questions about whether a band which had once been a defining influence on the entire genre had finally succumbed to age and artistic irrelevance. Of course, it wasn't an overnight process, this fall from grace, and every man and his dog has a different theory about precisely when the band jumped the proverbial shark, theories I don't propose to discuss further here.\n\nSo what matter of album is \"Death Magnetic\"? Well, as a great many reviewers have pointed out, it's not a classic along the lines of the band's early great work. To expect that would be misguided in the extreme. One of the major flaws in the much-touted \"thrash revival\" going on around us at present is that it seeks to emulate a world in which the last decade or more of musical evolution hasn't taken place. Had Metallica attempted such a project (were it even practically possible without sounding silly), the result would have been greeted with knowing smiles from those who remember the bad old good old days and reservations would have been made for them to open for the Rolling Stones on their next \"farewell tour\". In short, it would have been a disaster, but a much more charming one than the last disaster.\n\nWhat \"Death Magnetic\" is, then, is a very good album, and possibly even one of the best of the year depending on one's personal tastes. It can definitely stand up against the early classics, but only on the condition that it isn't seen as a pale copy of any of them. The album achieves its goal of salvaging Metallica's reputation, even if it disappoints those who were expecting it to burnish said reputation.\n\nThe majority of the tracks here are surprisingly strong, particularly when we consider that the songwriting genie seemed to have left the band alone on their previous outing. There are choruses which are just made for singing along to, even if the lyrics are slightly peculiar (\"All Nightmare Long\", for example), but of course Metallica aren't the kind of band I listen to for deep and meaningful lyrics. That said, brickbats for the rather generic chorus of \"Cyanide/I've already died\" in \"Cyanide\".\n\nJames' voice also seems a lot more present than in \"St Anger\". It's hard to explain it better than that, but the effect is that he seems to care more about what he's doing than he did on that album. That characteristic bark of the band's earlier glory days is back in full force, even though he occasionally seems to be getting stuck in lyrics from their mid/late 90s period. While \"All Nightmare Long\", as mentioned earlier, features rather odd lyrics, they're definitely given spirit by James, whose declaration that \"Your luck runs OUT-AH\" speaks volumes about a return to form whenever I hear it.\n\nMusically, everyone's back on the same page as well. As others have remarked, this album sees the return of solos - which are duly inserted into every track at least once. It's also an album which is played fast for a reason, rather than being played fast because the band feels it has to. There are mellower moments, \"The Unforgiven III\" is one such, but in general the band finds a rattling pace and sticks to it.\n\nOne of the real highlights here, in fact, is the instrumental \"Suicide & Redemption\". From my perspective, this is one of the clearest indications that the band likes what it's doing again, as there are all kinds of interesting riff and solo ideas thrown out here by both guitarists and the nearly 10-minute length of the track zips by in a moment.\n\nYes, there are some rather generic riffs thrown into some of the songs, too. It would be foolish to think that everything here is an absolute winner, and some riffs patently are not. What matters, though, is that the good outweighs the bad with interest.\n\nHave Metallica released another bona fide classic? Of course not. The torch has been well and truly passed, and rewinding the past decade and more is something we can't do, even if we want to. What they've done with \"Death Magnetic\" has been to demonstrate that there's still life in the old dog yet. In years to come, this will be an album people can look back on and recall as yet another important signpost on the road this band has travelled. I'm sure I'm not the only one hoping that it points in the direction of increased relevance, rather than being a detour.\n",
        "\nThe release of Death Magnetic is like watching a new, good sequel to 1986's Aliens. Like the band's Black Album, Load and Reload, Alien 3 was good but not without its share of faults, and Alien: Resurrection, well, my putting it as the equivalent of 2003's St. Anger speaks for itself. However, should James Cameron put out a new sequel to his sci-fi action masterpiece, it would be like Death Magnetic \u2013 nostalgic, refined and entertaining. Death Magnetic truly proves that Metallica is still a very alive metal band, ditching the sound of their albums since 1991's self-title blockbuster and creating what could have been released just between 1988's heralded \u2026And Justice for All and 1991's aforementioned hit.\n\nJust as told by Dr. Phil Towle, who accompanied the band's recording process of 2003's trashy St. Anger, their newfound appreciation of life and each other comes forth on display on this next release. And, although it's been five years since we've heard any new material, this one was well worth the wait. It's a more mature, very hungry addition to the band's \"four masterpieces\", taking elements from both their 80's stunning achievements, blending them with a bit of Load-ish elements right here and there and creating an all-together half-fresh, half-nostalgic sound that's more pleasurable than anything they've put out in twenty years.\n\nSome of this can be attributed to James Hetfield feeling that, what he's learned from the recording of Load and Reload, is that he'd rather create an album with nine or ten excellent song than two albums with thirty songs, putting all of his expression and creativity into a denser, more concentrated album with absolutely no filler material. Speaking of Hetfield, the riffs on this album are incredible. The E-chug might be back with a vengeance, but that's the signature Metallica sound and that's a sound that hasn't been released as new material for twenty years. His playing is tight and intense, and the riffs themselves heavy and enjoyable.\n\nAnother part of Death Magnetic's success can be attributed to long-time sleeper Kirk Hammett finally hitting the metal notes again on every song on this album. Gone are 2003's solo-empty snorefests \u2013 on every song on this album Hammett plays a solo, and he's all over it. His fast style is back, for better or worse \u2013 those who have never liked his style won't be turned over by his work here, yet those who do appreciate his emotional playing will be caught with a grin from ear to ear smeared all across their face.\n\nThe most predictable thing on this album is Lars Ulrich's drumming. I've never been a fan of Ulrich's playing and, just as with Hammett's solos, Death Magentic doesn't change a thing. Besides some interesting tempo changes and crazy beats on songs like The Judas Kiss and Cyanide, Ulrich's playing is almost wholly monotonous and uninteresting. Unfortunately, the presence of Robert Trujillo on bass is only rarely felt, to no fault of the band's. The gang was in Europe when Death Magnetic was mixed and mastered, and the result is a bit painful. Everything is very loud and epic, but the loudness war has been lost here \u2013 everything is so loud that at times the album sounds a bit fuzzy and the bass is sometimes inaudible. However, most times the album sounds just fine and huge, and the music is so good that moments of bad production can be overlooked, just as with the band's very own Justice album.\n\nDeath Magnetic features ten tracks, sharing a structural similarity to Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets and \u2026And Justice for all, starting and ending with fast songs fun to bang your head to, a ballady track as track #4, an instrumental right before the end, and this time, another ballad thrown in somewhere in the mix. The opening That Was Just Your Life would probably be the most grin-inducing moment for a fan since Blackened. Hetfield's rapping, aggressive vocals sound more like they did in the 80's (as well as the guitars, which are tuned back to E standard) and the chorus is violent, melodic and explosive, just as you'd expect from a Metallica song. The vocal hooks, excellent riffs and Hammett's solo set the stage for the solid, consistent experience that is Death Magnetic. The beauty of it is that this opening track is the perfect representative of the experience that you're about to have when you pop that white CD in. if you like it \u2013 you're in for a rush. If you don't \u2013 stop right here.\n\nFrom this point onwards, the album keeps its momentum and has so many moments where it shines, the mind of a Metallica fan might boggle. It could be the Fade-to-Black-meet-One feel of the intense The Day That Never Comes, the surprisingly middle-eastern All Nightmare Long (featuring one of Metallica's best choruses thus far) or the odd rhythms of The Judas Kiss. It may just as well be the incredible, subtle orchestration of The Unforgiven III or Hetfiel'd amazing lead guitar through the mid-section of new instrumental Suicide and Redemption. \u2013 every song has something to it that sets it apart from its album brethren and even from the entire Metallica back catalog, whose inspiration on these song is clearer than the sun on a summer day. \n\nThere are elements throughout the entire album that are so in place here, like the middle-eastern influences, Hetfield's combination of melodic and angry singing, amazing harmonizing guitars, fucking with structure and just experimenting with the old and the new, that simply make Death Magnetic a new, instant classic. Admittedly, the album is at times so sophisticated that you can't take all 75 minutes of it in just one listen. You'll have to give it time to grow on you, and grow on you it will if you just let it.\n\nIt's also cheap and has very fancy, interesting packaging, and the lyrics have the name James Hetfield written all over them, talking about death, betrayal, different inner struggles, confusion and suicide and featuring some of his lame puns that we've all come to expect (\"the son will shine\"). Just as anything else on this album, if you've never been a fan of Metallica's discography, Death Magnetic won't do anything to change that.\n\nAt the end of the day, Death Magnetic is a rousing success. Everything that Metallica tries to do here, they nail it. They go back to the E tuning, the dirty vocals, the fast guitar solos, the sophisticated structures and mix them all with what was good about the Load era (I'm one of the believers that Load and Reload had some excellent moments) to create the sound we've all been waiting for. It's a new metal album from the biggest metal band in the world, and their hunger seems just as it does upon listening to Master of Puppets. Mix melody with heaviness, pour a handful of amazing guitar work and add a grain of bad production and you get Death Magnetic \u2013 an instant, if slightly flawed, masterpiece. Two thumbs up for Metallica for this incredible release. Way up.\n",
        "\nMetallica - Death Magnetic hit the stores in 12.09.2008 which I had waited for a long time already. I knew I'd like the album so of course I went right away to buy it. I have followed this new 'Tallica CD session very carefully for several months, so carefully that only the people on these forums would know more about this situation than me. Yeah I'm kind of a Metallica fanboy because they were one of the first metal bands I heard and anyway their albums have always had at least some good stuff on them. Even Load & Reload had a few good songs and St.Anger, while really weird and different, was still actually pretty good for what it was meant to be (I'll review it some day if I feel like it). So it's no surprise I was expecting Death Magnetic to be good, especially when there was all that comeback hype around it.\n\nHowever, then the first songs leaked. \"The Day That Never Comes\", \"My Apocalypse\" and \"Cyanide\" in said order. And let me tell you, after I heard the 2 first ones from those I was completely convinced that Metallica has actually returned to their roots. \"The Day That Never Comes\" being exactly like \"Fade To Black\", \"Sanitarium\" and \"One\" and \"My Apocalypse\" having the real \"Damage, Inc.\" thrash esque in it. More songs were leaked through radio and at the end Metallica put the whole album on their website for free listening. All this happened before the actual release date.\n\nBut damn I love this album! These songs are long, the riffs sound cool, the choruses are catchy and solos brilliant (not always though). Death Magnetic has been called \"a mix between Master Of Puppets and St.Anger\", \"the missing link between And Justice For All and Black Album\" as it has also been hailed to be Metallica's return to thrash. Well, what's sure is that this album is actual METAL, not mainstream hard rock like Load & Reload nor is it nu metal influenced like St.Anger. Death Magnetic is fucking metal. And very good metal too. There's quite a few songs that are clearly thrash fucking metal like the first 2, All Nightmare Long and My Apocalypse and there's also some half-way thrash songs like Broken, Beat & Scarred, The Judas Kiss and even Cyanide. Then we have an instrumental and the 2 ballads which are The Day That Never Comes (\"One\" worship) and The Unforgiven III (guess what this one worships). Some of the song names and lyrics are pretty random but no one really listens to music solely for good song titles and \"meaningful\" lyrics....fuck that shit.\n\nOne thing different to St.Anger is that Metallica has finally allowed Kirk Hammett to play some solos! And he proves very clearly that even after Metallica's hard rock years he still has it. He still likes to use that wah-pedal but surprisingly he has reduced it a bit, like some solos on this album (The Day That Never Comes) are completely void of any wah-pedal use. Very catchy solos can be heard on the album, especially in the instrumental song \"Suicide & Redemption\". \n\nOh and the riffs. Fast paced tremolo picking and palm mutes can be heard as well as quite many cool power chord riffs too. Some are complete headbanger stuff (the first track, when that fucking riff kicks in....definitely one of the coolest single noted thrash riffs in history) and some are more melodic. There's clear choruses in every song and they're made catchy as hell, my favorite would be the one in All Nightmare Long...this one's straight out of the fucking 80's man!\n\nOh yes and like I said, there's also an instrumental track on this album (their old records had one so of course they had to do it here too). This song \u201dSuicide & Redemption\u201d is an almost 10 minutes long mid-tempo song and includes lots of enjoyable guitar solos as well as good bass solos too. It gets pretty boring after some time especially when the whole album is so damn long too, but it's still pretty good for occasional listening (although I'd recommend you to play Call Of Ktulu, Orion or To Live Is To Die instead of this one any day).\n\nIt's not all the way trying to be like this band's old stuff though, some moments on this album sound a lot like the Black Album and even Load. For example, the song \u201dCyanide\u201d is the closest thing to Load since....uh...Load. But unlike Load, this song is still metal and not complete hard rock. It's all well put together though and makes this album very enjoyable. There's so much the old 'Tallica to it, yet there's still new. It's like they revisited their entire discography and then threw in some completely new ideas as well. For example the song \"The Unforgiven III\", there is piano and some symphony in it. Only time I can think of Metallica using this stuff before is Nothing Else Matters (and of course S&M but that wasn't a studio album) and that's why this song really surprised me. Starting with a piano intro then adding some violins into it and violins can be heard in the chorus too. And then before the solo kicks in you can hear how the heavy symphonic part kicks in. I definitely haven't heard them doing anything like this before and it's great that there's something like this on the album. The symphonic part gives this song a heavy as hell atmosphere and reminds me of the keyboard moments Iron Maiden has been using in their latest albums. Hell yeah, I enjoy this album so much.\n\nNow let's move on to James Hetfield and his singing. He certainly sounds different here than before. Yeah, we know Hetfield got his puberty a bit later (lol) but there's more to it on Death Magnetic. James' singing is now more shout-like and similar to Tom Araya (from Slayer) and that makes him sound way more angry than ever before. On St.Anger he was mostly yelling and grunting angry as hell but there was also those off-key parts (like on The Invisible Kid \"oooooh what a good boy you are\") which sounded just ridiculous and stupid (and even I can't excuse them). But now there's none of that here, it's all just straight forward aggression non-stop. The clean vocal parts (like the whole intro to The Day That Never Comes) are still mellow and soft but when he gets really going...\n\nYes and then we have Lars Ulrich and his drumming. Drum sound isn't bad although it's not the best either. There's no klonk klonk snare like St.Anger but it's still pretty damn loud. As for the playing itself...now we all know he's not technically very talented, but he has actually improved a lot over the past few albums. He got really sloppy in Metallica's huge infaous sell-out era for some weird reason but on \u201dDeath Magnetic\u201d Lars surprisingly sounds pretty much as good as he did in his old 80's days. Good fills here and there, decent speed held up and some nice double bass parts can be heard (check out All Nightmare Long for some serious metal drumming). Seriously it's like everyone in this band has now improved and pushed themselves just to sound good on this record.\n\nI also need to point out these \"new songs\" Metallica played live in 2006. These were two punkish untitled songs which actually never found their way onto a studio release, except the intro from the first \"new song\" used in \"The End Of The Line\" (because The End Of The Line is definitely BETTER than that weirdo song).\n\nThen one thing we gotta talk about is the production. It's not as garage like as St.Anger and the haunting SNARE is now gone but instead Rick Rubin did something else to this record that can get to some people's nerves. Death Magnetic is mixed REALLY LOUD, everything is mixed high as if they tried to put EVERY instrument on the top of the mix. The amps run at full power and the gain is turned to maximum. There's so fucking much clipping on this record that some parts sound so distorted and clipped that you'd almost think there's something wrong with your speakers. Take the ending of the first track it sounds like everyone in the band is just trying to be fucking louder than hell. Lars beating the fuck out of his snare with crazy double bass all over the place, guitars strumming power chords and James Hetfield yelling on the top. Yeah Metallica won the loudness war....now what?\n\nThe production can get annoying when listening to this whole record but it's still not the end of the world or anything. You can still get past the mixing like I did because the music itself kicks so much ass. Besides the production here isn't weak like Justice and doesn't reduce the power of the music at all, if anything it actually enhances the force. Even if it goes quite a bit over the top. The loudness factor also makes this record sound pretty garage-like but I like it that way. Raw and uncompromising sound is always better to me than that sterile and stupid crystal clear Roadrunner production that every modern band (even some old ones like Cradle Of Filth, Megadeth and Testament) loves so hard to use these days.\n\nAll in all, Metallica is back. Death Magnetic is easily the strongest Metallica album since \"Justice\" and it succeeded to restore my faith towards these guys. Not that I had lost my hope for them completely but to know that Metallica can still do what they did in the past 80's makes me feel really good. It also makes me very glad that I bought this album the exact day it was released. \n\nRan out of words here...I think I'll just go listen to some Metallica again.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m going to open this review up with the usual Metallica apologist line- Metallica have (almost) never pandered to anyone. Black Album aside, there\u2019s been a series of albums that have been somewhat adventurous and annoying to many a fan.-Whether they were getting bigger and bigger prog-thrash boners, or going down a strange, experimental mix of shitty hard rock and awesome balladry, or dropping the particularly irregular shaped turd that was St.Anger, Metallica haven\u2019t tried to please anyone. Well, except for the black album (which is really messing this intro up, oh well).\n\nBut see, said integrity was starting to grate pretty hard. I loved the Loads, but St. isn\u2019t something I look back on with a good deal of fondness. Luckily for us, then, Metallica have decided to take a bit of a left turn with this release. They\u2019ve sold out, they\u2019ve pandered to the market, they\u2019ve whored themselves to their fans. And damn, it\u2019s about time.\n\nYeah, this album is the \u201chey we\u2019re really sorry about the last few albums guys, have a blowjob\u201d sort of thing that I would\u2019ve considered a bad idea if it just didn\u2019t sound so good. There\u2019s a bit of every Metallica album here- these guys have tried to cater to every different fan, and I think they\u2019ve done a pretty good job. Whether it\u2019s the groovy, hard-rocking and Load-ripping Cyanide (far better then any of the lame rock tunes on that album), the dyers/damage clone of My Apocalypse, or the balladry scattered around here, it\u2019s all completely unoriginal and it sounds totally terrific. Hell, their\u2019s even the occasional bit of St.Anger here, particularly in End of the Line. Move over Trivium, there\u2019s a new (and remarkably accurate) Metallica rip-off band in town!\n\nSeriously though, this stuff is pretty damn cool. It\u2019s not very original, with the possible exception of the new Unforgiven (bit of piano and strings; first time since NEM if I recall right), but fact remains is that this has James Hetfield writing heavy riffs and Kirk Hammett soloing his ass off, so it\u2019s going to be good. \u201cBroken, Beat and Scarred\u201d is a decent enough summary of this album- it will probably get a lot of hate as it\u2019s groovy and has a lot of stupid lyrics, but regardless it\u2019s still a sickeningly anthemic song, with some excellent black-album-esque riffing and a fairly complex, AJFA-ish arrangement. \u201cWhat don\u2019t kill you will make you more strong\u201d isn\u2019t some sort of Shakespearian refrain, but I haven\u2019t heard Hetfield this pumped up in a very, very long time, and the pre-chorus/\u201dShow Your Scars\u201d bit is crushing- in terms of \u201criffs that make me go absolutely nuts\u201d this is a hard one to beat.\n\nThe catchy Black/AJFA/Load thing continues throughout and for most of the time it sounds great. I\u2019ve mentioned \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d already but it\u2019s worth mentioning again; a fairly weak verse and chorus is made bearable by an epic mid section that any thrash band would love to have. Fast, catchy and super heavy - and with a sizeable debt to Slayer, not something you\u2019d normally hear from Metallica but welcome nonetheless. The first track is also excellent in all of it\u2019s AJFA-ish epic scope and mid paced thrash/heavy perfection. No one likes a track by track review, so I guess a simple \u201ctl;dr\u201d summary of most of the tunes are that there\u2019s almost always a horrible intro and terrible lyrics (less \u201cmetal\u201d style lyrics, James, you\u2019re heading down the self-parody road) but that\u2019s made up for by killer riffs everywhere else, a catchy chorus/refrain/shouted word, and an overall inspired, energetic feel. (\u201cYay, we\u2019re finally writing songs that people will let us play live!\u201d)\n\nIndeed, the whole band sounds tight and like they\u2018re having fun. Lars\u2019 drumming has gotten more and more simple but it\u2019s fast, straight forward, enthusiastic and fairly on-time. Generally those requirements are enough to suggest that Lars is an adequate drummer, so why knock him any more? No awkward fills, just straight ahead drumming with a bit of extra snare abuse. Trujillo\u2019s somewhere in the mix adding a bit of rumble, but (as with basically any Metallica album) the real joy to be found is in the two guitarists. Kirk- possibly the best wah-abusing guitarist with philippino ancestry ever- is in good form, whipping out some fairly shredding moments and not overstaying his welcome.\n\nBut it\u2019s James that makes this album as boner-inducing as it is. Granted that\u2019s a bit of a given; St.Anger excepted old Hetfield\u2019s been fighting it out with Goku from DragonBallZ and Jesus for the top spot on my \u201cMost awesome dudes ever\u201d list, and this record may just put him on top. He\u2019s spoofing riffs all over your face (and in your ass? Maybe?), he sounds angry and passionate again (despite my early claims about this being an obvious sell out, it\u2019s hard to say that when you hear him sing) and overall he just reminds everyone that there\u2019s a damn good reason why he\u2019s one of the most recognisable frontmen ever. Again, most of his lyrics (Unforgiven III being the main exception, I guess) will likely get you cringing, but it\u2019s just good to hear the James we all love and know back- not really singing, just shouting quite tunefully and with that awesome burly-man tone that he does so well.\n\nIt\u2019s not all perfect, James-lead awesomeness, though. The Judas Kiss has a killer chorus but will likely be remembered as the tune with the most awkward intro ever; Unforgiven III is probably a little bit too much of a confessional, and could use a few better riffs here and there - but it\u2018s got some decent lyrics and James sounds pretty soulful, so I can\u2018t really dislike it. However, Suicide and Redemption is a real turd of a song; no memorable riffs, and the first four minutes (some seriously uninspired riffery, here) was probably the longest four minutes of my life. Uninspired mid paced stoner trash, it really screams \u201cHey, the fans demand an instrumental, let\u2019s put one on!\u201d\n\nAnd the fucking production! I\u2019m not a big fan of cussing in my reviews, but who the fuck mastered this? Merzbow called, he wants his square waves back! Constant clipping every time a snare hits, no dynamics whatsoever; this makes \u2018Californication\u2019 sound like an old classical recording by comparison. (Those not sure what I\u2019m talking about would be advised to wiki \u201cLoudness War\u201d). It\u2019s fatiguing, headache inducing and makes the whole album (which is not a short listen) a real struggle to get through- it\u2019s a shame as the mix and recording, while a bit dry, is quite acceptable.\n\nBut hey, perhaps the stupidly overloud mix was the one part of the album where Metallica did not want to take your load in their/it\u2019s (no idea if you refer to a band as singular or as a collective) mouth(s). Referring back to my introductory spiel- this is a huge sell out, but if the band wants to bend over for me then that\u2019s fine; \u2018tis better to give then to receive like we all did with St.Anger. It\u2019s a career-spanning retrospective with not a lot of real daring or innovation; but despite that (or perhaps because of it) it\u2019s a killer, super entertaining thrash/heavy/hard rock album that pretty much anyone will enjoy.\n",
        "\nSt. Anger is actually first song I ever heard from Metallica. Or the first song was Nothing else matters, I don't really remember, but the important thing is I have got this nostalgic feeling every time I hear the song. Now before you start judging me, it was about 6 years ago and nowadays I know that there are better songs than St. Anger. Oh, and I am not any kind of Metallica fan boy, I don't own any of their CD's and neither do I own St. Anger, I just know the song.\n\nNow about the music. The music is noisy and aggressive, and melodic at the same time. That's one of the main reasons why I like the song so much. The drums on the intro blast beat sound awesome, even the hated snare is not so annoying in this song, in fact the drums' \u201emetal\" sound (metal like iron, steel or whatever, not musical genre) suits the song perfectly. Acoustic part after the blast beat is quickly followed by far more aggressive part, and the shouts \u201eYou flush it out!\" are just really cool. \n\nPerformances of musicians on this song cannot be judged separately because the song's main theme is anger, anger and once more anger, and all the instruments' plus vocals' role is to express it, and they succeeded in this task. Sure there are better guitar riffs, or better drummers or better whatever, but this song is supposed to sound like it does, and it suits it perfectly. \n\nThere is only one thing that destroys the songs' \u201eAbsolutely amazing!\" status, and that is the lack of a guitar solo. I am not saying that a solo is absolutely necessary in a rock song, but it's really really close to absolutely necessary, and at the moment I can't remember any good song without a solo. But surely there are some. Hell, even Bryan Adams' Everything I Do has got a solo. \n\nI really love this song, and the video is also pretty cool. But here on MA, there are so many \"new Metallica\" haters nowadays, and this song does not deserve it. And \"Fuck it all and no regrets!\" actually expresses what I was thinking about all this Metallica hatred when I gave the song 95 percents. It deserves it.\n",
        "\nJust as anyone expecting a second 'Painkiller' by Judas Priest this year, people crossing their fingers in hope for anything remotely sounding like Metallica's four earlier 80's works in 'Death Magnetic' will be disappointed to say the least, even more so after all the hype that was built around this release.\n\n'Death Magnetic' sounds like a cross between 'And Justice For All' and 'The Black Album', with some good pinches of all the crap they released since then thrown in and stirred. Rick Rubin has done miracles and improved the band's sound - no trash can lid snare, as it has been mentioned - but some things can't change or come back. Hetfield still seems to believe he can really sing and annoys everyone with his post-1990 vocal style. Lars never ceases to surprise us by showing what an actually poor drummer he is, especially when compared to other drummers in the genre, in a performance that inspires pity and not awe. Hammet is soloing again, which is a relief, but he just doesn't seem to have the genius or creativity of older days, with very few truly memorable moments. Trujillo plays the role of bringing us a Metallica album in which the bass can be heard, which is a feat in itself, but doesn't do anything special, which brings the word 'waste of talent' to mind. \n\nWhat about the songs? With repetitive and 'groovy' riffs, although heavier than anything the band has released in the past 20 years, and long songs surpassing the 7-minute barrier neeedlessly, it is impossible to call 'Death Magnetic' a thrash metal album, save very rare and brief moments. The first three or four songs follow this formula, without forgetting long introductions in an attempt to build up momentum. The lyrics are poor and with some political content here and there, and the attempt to do something in the vein of 'Damage Inc.' with 'My Apocalypse' is valid, despite not coming even close and the horrendous chorus, just as instrumental 'Suicide and Redemption' doesn't come even close to anything like 'Orion', sounding more like a riff they had no use for and thus decided to turn into this song. 'The Day That Never Comes' tries to be 2008's 'One', despite Lar's incompetence. 'All Nightmare Long' has the best intro, taking us back to the 80's for the first time - and sounding a bit like Slayer in the process - but the riff soon breaks down and turns into more of the same, not helped by Hetfield's voice, which comes in and ruins everything with no aggression or balls. 'Cyanide' is the total garbage track on this album, since nothing can be saved on this one, unless you're into halfassed quasi-pop riffs and vocals, while 'The Unforgiven III' comes as a surprise, since it is actually better in many ways than its predecessors. 'The Judas Kiss' is just heavy rock with more lame vocals and no appeal, pretty tiring overall. \n\nCompared to 'St Anger' this is a magnificent CD, but that really doesn't mean much for anyone truly into thrash and who's been listening to these guys since the early days. One can't blame it on their age, for many bands from that era are still around and making great music. The bottom line for me is I still do not like post-1990 Metallica, and you're lucky if you do, although this album is superior to the previous ones and to 80% of what has been glorified in the media lately... In terms of thrash, better stick to Slayer, Exodus and Kreator, or one of the new bands, for Metallica's millionaire uncles just can't pull it off anymore.\n",
        "\nUsually \u2018great\u2019 bands are automatically subjected to more rigorous analysis from critics than their mere mortal peers. Metallica, the usual (mainstream) critic\u2019s choice for \u2018metal band I\u2019ve allowed myself to like, so stop bothering me about that genre please,\u2019 has basically been the exception to this rule since (approximately) the 1997 release of Reload. Prior to that record, and the band\u2019s subsequent vacation from actually composing new material, Metallica were the subject of credible criticism that demonstrated the potential to really dig into where the band were as artists, and where they might go. Some of the most interesting metal criticism I\u2019ve read dates from this period, when it seemed Metallica might finally drag heavy music back to legitimacy. Since then, mainstream critics have simply lost interest in actually interacting with this music. Each new Metallica album is greeted positively and then forgotten, forgotten so thoroughly that by the time the next Metallica album arrives these same critics describe it as a comeback and significant improvement over the previous one, and then proceed to give it virtually the same grade the last received. Where then, does one go for legitimate Metallica criticism? Embittered metal fanzines? O\u2019 poor babe in arms, for there be the realm of the depressingly literal-minded, the lunkheaded punter wolf in an academic\u2019s woollen smoking jacket. Hardcore Metallica fans? An unbiased view, nowhere in sight.\n\nAnd somewhere, twixt the reviews-by-rote and the riff-counts-in-review-form, arises the new Metallica album, Death Magnetic. One might assume from the first paragraph that I\u2019m planning on doing some kind of self-important master-class lecture to show how criticism of Metallica \u2018ought to be done.\u2019 Not so! For this album is the first since the self-titled to be exactly as it appears. There is none of the intriguing collision of personality that made Load and St. Anger so fascinating, no experimentation that reveals itself gradually over many listens, no question as to what the intentions of this seventy-four minute marathon are. Metallica have simply been kicked in the teeth so many times that, finally, they have acquiesced to the begging of their fans and gone somewhere they\u2019ve already been before. Your bitching has finally broken them and, at times, it does almost seems like a good thing to have a new Metallica album to pop into the player and just listen to without feeling challenged to find reason (or even justification). It\u2019s familiar ground, with that Metallica smell you\u2019ve known since puberty, something like cummy sweatsocks, incense and vodka. But alas, such familiarity is a breeding ground for the blackest of contempt.\n\nMetallica have waxed and waned in ways both subtle and profound since they last cut a thrash record, and with Death Magnetic they\u2019re playing to strengths that have atrophied significantly in the past twenty years. It was unfair to compare Load to Master of Puppets because in every respect they were meant to be different records; Death Magnetic so adamantly slots itself in next to their original masterpieces that it\u2019s impossible to judge the album in vacuum. Where classic Metallica songs were often long, it was because each track was stuffed to the brim with ideas, ideas paced to perfection, seldom overstaying their welcome and each inspiring headbanging satisfaction like few other bands ever could. Death Magnetic songs are long because old Metallica songs were long, and people really like old Metallica songs. Songs as swollen as Ulrich\u2019s prostate are the order of the day here, the chugging amelodic \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d seemingly being the primary template for interminable bores like \u201cThe End of the Line\u201d and \u201cBroken, Beat & Scarred\u201d. I\u2019ve heard it said that every song here feels two minutes too long, and while that\u2019s not always true, on an album this long that\u2019s probably accurate as a rough average. And God\u2026 look away from \u201cThe Day That Never Comes\u201d, one of the most baffling choices for a single 2008 has yet seen.\n\nIt\u2019s easy enough to draw further analogues to the length issue in every aspect of this record. There were instrumentals on old Metallica albums because the band had compositional ideas that were ill-suited to conventional song formats, so they wrote pieces that were almost classical in scope and construction. The new one has an instrumental because they always used to do instrumentals, and as a result the battery-drained \u201cSuicide & Redemption\u201d winds up a bigger waste of ten minutes than anything they've previously coughed up, in spite of some Hammettian heroics. At least \u201cAll Within My Hands\u201d and \u201cInvisible Kid\u201d were fascinating car wrecks. Hetfield\u2019s lyrics used to be angry because his life was in turmoil, a turmoil caused in part by the grating falseness of \u201880s popular culture. By now, you can guess why the lyrics are angry on Death Magnetic. This piffle isn\u2019t the work of the lyricist who so memorably blossomed on Load; it\u2019s that same lyricist twelve years later, denied artistic relevance and reduced to lines like \u201cSearched the seas of gold/How come it\u2019s got so cold?\u201d. Hell, even the overly loud, bass-less production might be some kind of perverse throwback to their earlier work.\n\nThere are bright spots, however, and virtually all of them can be found on the second half of the record. Kirk Hammett absolutely lights it up every time he steps up to the plate, blistering highlight coming midway through the otherwise uneven \u201cThe Unforgiven III\u201d (which, as an aside, sounds at times like what the original might\u2019ve been, had it been on Countdown to Extinction instead of the Black Album) and generally reinstating himself as the king of shredders with limited chops. \u201cAll Nightmare Long\u201d sports a truly infectious chorus and some monster truck rally riffing and \u201cThe Judas Kiss\u201d borders on the tech-thrash mania of old, while unfairly maligned advance single \u201cCyanide\u201d is a masterpiece of late game hurry-up offence, a decent groover that tightens up into a righteous Egypto-thrash rave-up. Most remarkable of all is \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d, not because it\u2019s the best song on the album (though it\u2019s close) but because it\u2019s really the closest Metallica come to sounding like they used to. It\u2019s not significantly worse than, say, \u201cDamage Inc.\u201d, and it\u2019s also more pointedly traditional thrash than anything that has come out of the big four this past decade.\n\nBut if the most remarkable moment on a Metallica album is the fact that it happens to be thrash, the experience (for me at least) becomes rather hollow. Is this better than St. Anger? Probably, but I won\u2019t listen to Death Magnetic half as often as I did that record. Bereft of the adventure Metallica\u2019s previous modern-era efforts have promised, the potential that even the most disastrous of songs could grow and appreciate, we\u2019re left with a record that is all style and no substance. And so, maybe this will unite the mainstream critics and those fans just looking for a record that isn't hiding any nasty surprises. For me though, I\u2019m struck by the feeling that, for the first time ever, Metallica don\u2019t care if they\u2019re advancing. Excellent though it was, \u2026And Justice for All found the band beginning to hint that everything was becoming thrash-by-numbers, and to their credit they decided to make a change. Twenty years ago they knew they didn\u2019t want to make this record. And now they have.\n\nStand-Out Tracks: \u201cAll Nightmare Long\u201d, \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d, \u201cThe Judas Kiss\u201d\n",
        "\nWe finally have the new Metallica record that will supposedly show the world that they are back and on top of the metal heap, which is what I'm sure the fanboys and clueless music media will proclaim. Well Death Magnetic is more metal than they have been since the Black album, and it\u2019s not terrible, but it\u2019s not great either. \n\nThere are some good riffs here and there, some good solos, and the drums are better than on St. Anger at least. The bass is mostly lost in the horrific production. This is a poster boy for the loudness wars. Songs like That Was Just Your Life try to channel the old Metallica power but come up just a bit short in the end. Lars drums a bit better than he has since the Metallica album, but that still isn't saying much if one has gotten used to listening to real masters behind the kit. The drums are a bit high in the mix but not enough to make one annoyed. Thankfully the snare does not sound like a trash can lid being hit as on St. Anger, kicking Bob Rock to the curb was the best move the band has made in 20 years, Rick Rubin at least got them to play some decent metal again, avoiding the mainstream rock of the Loads and the nu-metal styling of St. Anger. On the guitar front Kirk shreds on some solos but his tone and wah heavy sound are still the same so if you don't like that you probably won't think he does much good here. Hetfield\u2019s rhythm playing is pretty tight for most of the album, giving the riffs good weight but they just aren't the very satisfying to listen to. None of the riffs have anything to make one think there is that much staying power to these songs. Listening to the vocals James tries to get a bit of the classic Hetfield growling bark back but still slips into his terrible clean voice of the past few albums too much. \n\nThe main highlight is the final track, My Apocalypse. It\u2019s fairly thrashy, with some good riffage and pretty strong lyrics. This song opens strong with a cool riff and then the drums kick in the song doesn\u2019t let up. If the whole album had been this good it would have been a higher rating, probably in the high 70\u2019s but I don\u2019t think they have enough left in the tank to write a whole album like this. A third Unforgiven track makes an appearance here but like the others is totally forgettable. The first single, The Day that Never Comes, is just a rip of their prior ballads, Fade to Black and One, but unlike those songs it is very mediocre with no real hooks to draw the listener in, I found it a bit jarring in places. An issue with some of the songs on here is the length, most of these could be cut by a couple minutes without losing anything. Long does not mean epic or progressive guys. \n\nUltimately this sounds like a band trying to be Metallica again but just coming up short since they just aren't that band anymore. Musically it is probably a mix of the long Justice songs with the mostly thrashless playing of the Metallica album. And while it\u2019s good enough technically it\u2019s just lacking the riffs to make it memorable. It opens strong, and finishes strong; too bad the middle section mostly goes nowhere. \n\nStandout tracks. This Was Just Your Life, My Apocalypse.\n",
        "\nThere is a surreal aspect to experiencing a Metallica album, perhaps because of the absolute difficulty involved in trying to hear what is put forth with an iota of objectivity. Who can honestly talk about this band with another person without having to take into account the media factor, their incredible popularity, and all of the other nonsense that hasn\u2019t shit to do with the music? It could be said that the experience of listening to \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d is a test of sorts. And the trial set forth being can one actually ignore the rest of the world and hear the album for what it is.\n\nSurprisingly enough, after hearing this album I\u2019m going to have to disagree in part with the sentiments of the bulk of the online community. \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d is fairly similar to \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, in the sense that it seeks to try and merge a lot of differing elements together and comes out extremely uneven and stylistically all over the place. If you consider each song individually, it\u2019s easy to find yourself utilizing the skip and repeat buttons fairly often, as I\u2019m sure many people would use the former for \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d and \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d, while also employing the latter for \u201cBattery\u201d and \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d. And like the largely hailed 1986 release, most of these songs tend to be a little too long for their own good.\n\nNaturally due to what I believe is an undeserved legendary status being given to that album, I\u2019ll instead recommend you compare this to Machine Head\u2019s recent alleged thrash album \u201cThe Blackening\u201d or maybe Pantera\u2019s \u201cReinventing The Steel\u201d. Although like \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d those albums had a better production than this dead, hollow, half-assed modern mixing job; they both contain this misguided desire of trying to incorporate groove, yet keep the songs stretched to near epic time length, despite the obvious monotony or meandering that will result. Even for an all out progressive metal outfit, having an album where only one song is less than 6 minutes long can be a big red flag waving so close to your face that the pole it\u2019s on knocks you upside the head.\n\nNow some might be inclined to ask what could be wrong with the production, since this obviously can\u2019t be the mess that \u201cSt. Anger\u201d was. I couldn\u2019t really figure it out myself at first, but for some reason this album sounded extremely hostile to my ears, so I dug back into Metallica\u2019s history to understand what was causing this. Throughout the 80s up until 1991 there was this practice that was likely due to the analog technology of the time where reverb was used to augment the sound of every instrument, resulting in something fairly similar to what is heard when you see a band live, but without the crowd noise. To an extent, this atmosphere survived in the 90s material through the drum and vocal production, though it was canned when it came to the guitars, as everyone was going for this so called organic rock sound at the time, which I personally found revolting.\n\nBy contrast, what has happened here, in the aftermath of a botched attempt at sounding raw on \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, is a reversal of the 90s tendency. The guitars have regained the thickness and aggression that they have lacked for 15 years, although the lead guitars have taken on a slightly mellower flow than the high end thinness of Kirk\u2019s soloing heyday in the 80s. The drums, in turn, have taken on this extremely dead sounding, cardboard meets a plastic bucket sound common to many rock outfits today where there is basically no center or sustain to the sound. This is entirely due to going for this horrid concept of an organic drum sound, which is also the approach taken with the vocals, resulting in every flaw in Hetfield\u2019s aging and tortured voice being front in center. Most people don\u2019t notice this because they\u2019ve been conditioned to accept this as a normal recording practice in the past 10 years, but if you listen to anything up until 1992 by this band, you can tell that the disconnect production wise is pretty fucking massive. Some people might be okay with this so-called organic and sonically perfect sound, but the results I hear is fairly decent metal music that has had all of its soul and atmosphere gutted and mummified into a dry heap of bones instead of what could otherwise have been a full body of sound.\n\nBut when you step closer into the forest and begin to examine the individual trees, some of the music on here does suggest a return to form of sorts. In terms of speed and implied aggression, this album doesn\u2019t fall too far from having similarities to \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d, though production wise the resemblance is non-existent. Elements of earlier works are also present to a lesser degree, while a lot of elements of the slowed down style of \u201cThe Black Album\u201d take form. Sometimes it results in a fairly solid song that can push past the production issues, even morphing into an all out thrash fest, while at others things either come off as disjointed and confused or even bring out the production flaws to the point that any merit to the song is lost.\n\nThe songs that really shine are the ones that seem to go for the latter half of Metallica\u2019s better days. The obvious winner is the album\u2019s opener \u201cThat Was Just Your Life\u201d, which contains this great atmospheric, almost doom-like guitar intro that misleads the listener into thinking that might actually be a genuine reform to form happening here. Although when the drums come in the production problems loom and the vocal job that follows has some issues, the song just continually kicks ass and throws out solid riff after solid riff in the typical Bay Area thrash approach. \u201cBroken, Beat And Scarred\u201d and \u201cThe Judas Kiss\u201d have elements of better days mixed in with some occasional modern rock elements, mostly resembling a faster version of \u201cThe Black Album\u201d in overall style, though sounding closer to a heavier version of \u201cLoad\u201d in terms of production. The closing song \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d is a straight up thrasher mostly in the \u201cBattery\u201d fashion, but without the acoustic nonsense at the beginning. If it weren\u2019t for James\u2019 lackluster yells and Lars\u2019 horrible drum sound, both of which are extremely exposed due to the production of the album, this song would have solidified a true return to form.\n\nMuch of the rest of the album doesn\u2019t really deliver what most are probably looking for in this album. \u201cThe Day That Never Comes\u201d and \u201cUnforgiven III\u201d are two rather poor attempts at revisiting two rather similar sounding ballads from Metallica\u2019s past, namely \u201cFade To Black\u201d and \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d. The former comes off partially like a \u201cLoad\u201d ballad mixed with some quasi-thrash ideas towards the end and featuring an opening riff sounding a little too similar to a U2 song, while the latter can\u2019t help but remind me heavily of a boring as hell \u201cStone Temple Pilots\u201d song with a piano in it. Both of these bring out the worst elements of the drum production issues and are practically un-listenable. \u201cThe End Of The Line\u201d and \u201cCyanide\u201d are annoying as hell mishmashes of groove and modern metal, both offering very little enjoyment for someone looking for 80s Metallica. \n\nWhen you tally up the ratio of good music to bad music, this is the best thing that Metallica has put forth in 17 years. However, when you compare the garbage that was put out during that time, this is hardly a major accomplishment. This is not a thrash metal album, nor does having 2 or 3 mostly thrash songs and a couple solid heavy metal songs even give the appearance of it being that. As a groove metal album it\u2019s a hell of a lot better than 85% of what the genre has put forth, but again the comparison does not equal something that can be called great or exceptional. But if you wish to delude yourself into thinking that this is the return of the old Metallica, there just might be enough good ideas spread out in here to keep the illusion somewhat sustainable.\n\nI guess the media acceptance of this band and the false comfort that some take in it is the ultimate reason that people continually hold out hope for Metallica to bring back thrash metal, because this album\u2019s thrash credentials amount to an over-hyped lie, and one that is even more egregious than the one Robb Flynn tried to perpetuate last year. If you take this for what it actually is, it\u2019s not terrible or without any merit, but the way this has been stuffed down people\u2019s throats by the entertainment media is downright offensive and I\u2019m not playing into it. If you want to blow $17 or more buying a poorly produced, overlong, half-hearted, half-thrash album then go right ahead, but wiser men would wait a few weeks for the bargain bins to start filling up.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on September 12, 2008.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the absolute worst ideas in the history of mankind. Step aside Holocaust: The Musical and women\u2019s suffrage; you\u2019ve been demoted from atrocity to unpleasantry. Genocide-based J-pop musicals don\u2019t seem nearly as offensive in the face of this immeasurable evil (Note: If Nobuo Uematsu ever writes such a thing, I\u2019d sooner be a patron of that than listen to this album again). Whoever thought this would be a good idea (for anything other than making money, obviously) should be \u2013 I can\u2019t even finish that sentence without getting a migraine from being so angry at the mere thought of this album. Simply trying to remember why I hate this album so much to justify a review is doleful, at its most tolerable.\n\nWhy is this a terrible idea? Answer: Because the overwhelming majority of Metallica songs would sound grotesquely absurd in conjunction with an orchestra, thereby rendered stupid-as-fuck by dissimilation. There is Metallica, and then, there is a symphony. There is no coherency, relevance, or otherwise notable reasoning for putting these two together, besides lining their pocketbooks and sending me into convulsive fits of frothing rage. The sheer asininity of this amalgamation is so confounding as to be reminiscent of the scene in Talladega Nights where Cal is ignorantly trying to compare Ricky and himself to other \"perfect pairs,\" and from thence cometh the title of this review (Search \u201cCocaine and Waffles\u201d on Youtube if you haven\u2019t seen the movie).\n\nOn top of that, they didn\u2019t pick good songs. Naturally, I understand that \u201cgood\u201d is rather subjective, but this is one case where it isn\u2019t: the songs from Load and Reload are bad. No one person or persons of sane mind with a collective IQ higher than a box of Sunmaid raisins or a jar of stagnant pickle juice would ever, under any circumstances, enjoy those albums, barring the song Fuel. And before you point it out, yes, it is only an exception because I like it. Seven full-lengths into their overlong career, Metallica had, at best, a quaint little arsenal of quality songs at their disposal, and they really seemed to go out of their way to pick the absolute worst ones. If they had picked a lot of their hits, I\u2019d still be pissed off just because this is such a fucking horrible idea, but I wouldn\u2019t be nearly as repulsed. Out of 21 songs on this album, only six were songs that I would enjoy under normal circumstances and recording situations, but only one of those being enjoyable in its currently reviewed state. Out of 21 songs, only one is worth listening to. The song is \u201cNothing Else Matters,\u201d but since that song pretty much qualifies by default as it was recorded with an orchestral backing, it\u2019s hardly fair. \n\nThe orchestra plays well enough, but the music isn\u2019t any more fitting than having a soundtrack playing while you feed the dog, or go about various other routine activities; I really cannot stress how much this just doesn\u2019t belong. James sounds like shit. Lars does too, of course, but that hardly requires stating. Sadly, the orchestra actually detracts from a few of what would otherwise be songs that I enjoy. Also: I cannot stand the production. I haven\u2019t heard the CD in years, (because, like any gentleman would, I deleted it in lieu of stealing art of a more refined quality) but I\u2019ve recently (and unfortunately, quite regularly; Circuit City be damned) watched/heard the 5.1 mix from the DVD on an audio setup totaling no less than $3000 dollars, with line conditioning and quality cabling, and it still sounded like shit. James is constantly at the forefront, while everything else is just muddied up terribly.\n\nIf you want a live combination of metal with an orchestra that actually works, check out Dream Theater\u2019s Score DVD. That is fantastic. There was not a single point during that concert that I felt the orchestra was forced or gimmicky; it was natural, fluid, and at all times, a wholly enriching experience. Kudos, DT. \n\nFor me, listening to this album is akin to what our poor droog Alex in \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d experienced upon hearing Beethoven, Handel, and the like following the Ludovico treatment; a deep, terrible sickness that wells up from the inside to such an extreme extent as to prevent him from listening to it altogether. That, O my brothers, is what I feel when I like slooshy S&M.\n\nThis album gets a 3% score. 1/21 (for one good song) is 4.76, but shitty production, singing, drumming, and general frustration lower it to a 3, and even that is gratuitous, all things considered. Unquestionably, one of the worst albums I've listened to in entirety, regardless of genre.\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard that Metallica was going to be releasing a new album, I had my doubts about it. Especially consider the amount of shitty albums they have released in the last 15 years. From the alternative/bluesy borefest of Load/Reload to the nu-metalish pseudo-heavy sounding St. Agony (as Mr. Boris referred to it as) which featured the *bong bong* noises of Lars banging on a trash can and Hetfield's god-awful \"oooooohhhhh!!!\" singing complete with down-tuned guitars and no soloing, many thought that this band was finished. Hell, I was even convinced that this band was never going to release a decent, more to less good album ever again. \n\nThen, recently I heard The Day that Never Comes on the radio, and I thought, \"Damn! This song is actually pretty good.\" Since then, my hopes for the band had become more optimistic. I thought that Metallica might actually make a decent album after all. Hell, they even went back to their old classic logo which was a sign.\n\nThen, just last night actually, Metallica were generous enough to leak the new album on their website before it's release (Kind of ironic considering the whole Napster thing.) So I gave the album a listen, and I was to say the least, impressed. Metallica, for the most part anyway, are back. This album proves that they still know how to thrash. Not only that, but Kirk Hammet's guitar playing is pretty awesome, and is the saving grace of this album. Plus, his and Hetfield's riffs are pretty good as well. It's mainly the guitars that make this album, considering that the vocals or the druming obviously, isn't really that good.\n\nProduction wise, this album reminds me of Judas Priest's Jugulator minus the drums. It has the heavy yet crunchy tone of that album without sounding too groovy. The guitars were produced nicely. Though, the drums as mentioned before are too loud in the mix. Eh, at least we don't have that trash can sound anymore.\n\nThe highlights of the album would have to be This Was Just Your Life, The Day That Never Comes, The Judas Kiss, the instrumental Suicide & Redemption, and especially My Apocalypse. The Day That Never Comes starts off mellow, but towards the end speeds up and thrashes just in time for an awesome solo from Kirk. I'll say again that Kirk's soloing is nothing short of amazing. His solos here are very memorable despite what the last reviewer said. He doesn't even resort to using the wah pedal either unlike in the past. This song reminds me of Sanitarium with a bit of One mixed in as well. A lot of metal fans didn't like this song, but I'm proud to say that I enjoyed it. \n\nThe Judas Kiss and My Apocalypse are the thrashiest songs on here. My Apocalypse especially is the highlight of the album, showing that Metallica hasn't forgotten how to thrash, and those who thought otherwise are wrong. It's similar to Battery and Dyers Eve, as it's fast, angry, and aggressive. Suicide & Redemption is an amazing 10 minute long instrumental that doesn't get boring. Once again, Kirk's soloing is amazing to say the least, and even the riffs are pretty good. I say it's up there with Orion and To Live Is to Die.\n\nAll Nightmare Long would kick ass if it weren't for Hetfield's annoying \"yeeeaahhh!!! \"ooouuutah!!! singing. The rest of the song displays a very song sense of thrash. The guitar and drumming sounds very thrashy, almost like something out of Overkill's early 90s material.\n\nHowever, there are some lackluster songs on this album as well. Cyanide and The Unforgiven III are easily the worst songs on the album. Cyanide sounds like something out of the Load/Reload era except a bit more tolerable. It's a pretty mediocre metal song to say the least. The Unforgiven III is yet another half-assed ballad. It proves that Metallica should not be writing ballads. They don't have the emotion nessacary to make memorable and enjoyable ballads. However, those are the only two really mediocre songs on the whole album. Everything else on here is pretty damn good.\n\nFor the most part, this album proves that Metallica are back. It's a major step up from Load/Reload, and even The Black Album and the overrated And Justice For All. I'd say it's their best album since Master of Puppets. It's not the most consistent album, and there are better albums out there from other thrash bands, but it's still a pretty solid album considering that the band that made it hasn't made a decent more to less good album since The Black Album. I just bought this album today at my local Best Buy for $10, and I'd say it was well worth the money.\n\nIf you only like Metallica's first four albums, then they're may be a few songs that you'll dig, but if you liked The Black Album as well, you might find this album very enjoyable since it's pretty much a mix between The Black Album-era Metallica and their classic thrash era. If you're a Metallica fan, then what are you waiting for? Get this album now!\n",
        "\nRight from the start of 2008 one would know that September would be the month to look out for. Not only because of Metallica\u2019s first release in five years but also because there were a hundred other releases to look out for. Here have a look at the possible releases this month: - \u201cIced Earth\u201d, The pioneers of power\\thrash metal coming forth for the last release of the trilogy of the ever so famous \u201cSomething Wicked This Way Comes\u201d series will be releasing \u201cThe Crucible Of Man\u201d. Amon Amarth, the band whose popularity with respect to Viking Metal is almost unchallenged (except by \u201cBathory\u201d) will be releasing \u201cTwilight Of The Thunder God\u201d, which will be interesting too after the attention they so successfully achieved after their last album. Apart from this you have thrash giants \u201cMetal Church\u201d and new comers \u201cPsychotic Terror\u201d coming up with new LP\u2019s in the same month, and it doesn\u2019t stop here. Evergrey, All Shall Perish, Omnium Gatherum, Batllelore, Haggard, Falconer, Enslaved, Trivium, The Haunted, Poisonblack and Andromeda will all be releasing new stuff this month.\n\nOf all the months this year this month also has maximum diversity in the releases with releases in every possible genre and sub-genre in metal. There are releases in melodic death, folk, power, thrash, black, orchestral/symphonic, metalcore and gothic metal. Thus not only is a band competing with the quantity and diversity of bands they are also competing with quality because most of the bands are very well known in their respective genres. So be it any band, even Metallica with the largest fan base in metal history, even they had to put out a strong release to stand up high amongst all these bands. Hell, if you consider all spheres you also have the duo of Robert Di Nero and Al Pacino acting in a movie together for the first time since 1995, whose release date is this month too\u2026 but I guess I\u2019ll stick to the music here. Big month, huh? Sure Is.\n\nThe expectations and speculations about Metallica\u2019s began way back in the June of 2006, which is more than 2 years back when they played two tracks (The New Song and The Other New Song) live for the very first time. This was followed by the band creating so much hype in every possible and unimaginable way to make this release single-handedly one of the most awaited albums of all times. The band opened a new site (Mission Metallica) to keep fans up to date with every minute update related to the new album. The band released the album title ALPHABET BY ALPHABET, which took over a month and yet another month to release the album artwork. Such was the hype that they managed to create that everyday millions of people would log on to this site just to get a glimpse of the new alphabet. This created so much traffic on the site that even crashed a couple of times. Metallica were once again in control of the entire music world but this time they had not even released the album yet!\n\nBeing an avid fan of the band since God knows when I too was part of this huge mass of hype-blinded people but after a while this concerned me. It occurred to me that not only were the bands creating hype but also increasing the expectations ten-fold. So that meant if Metallica released a bad album, the fan\u2019s expectations would turn to anger and this would result not only in disappointment but also both the media as well as fans crushing them with a lot more force than they would have had the band not created the amount of the hype they did. Creating hype can be a double-edged sword and was the sharper side pointing towards them? Was the band making a mistake this time by creating too much of hype, a little for them to handle?\n\nWe started hearing stuff from the new album in August when the band started releasing ten to fifteen second instrumental samples from each song of the album. Even though one couldn\u2019t reach a conclusion after just hearing material that lasted a few seconds a few things were made loud and clear. The guitar work though was pretty good and so was the bass. The stuff was pretty heavy, the heaviest they had done in the last 20 years and they had certainly returned to their roots, and not those roots they said they\u2019d return to when they did St. Anger. But still all this still did not answer one very major question. How did James sound now 5 years after his dismal performance on the band\u2019s last LP?\n\nThe first track we heard was \u201cCyanide\u201d, when it was played live in Texas in August itself. I personally was expecting quite a lot more than what the track had offered to me. James sounded bad, Lars was trying a little too hard to sound as good as he did on\u201d\u2026 And Justice For All\u201d which resulted in a mess, Kirk was still using the wah-wah a lot and well he didn\u2019t play it well. The saving grace for me was Trujillo and his bass. His bass lines and riffs were pretty damn good and catchy. Yet, I was very disappointed and gave myself hope that it would sound much better on a properly and professionally recorded CD and decided not to jump to conclusions though I felt that if the album sounded like this then the sharper edge of the sword actually pointing towards the band and this time more menacingly.\n\nThe first official track we heard off of the album was \u201cThe Day That Never Comes\u201d and like expected it had mixed reviews. I personally loved it and it was the best work they had done since their self-titled work. The bass was good, James\u2019 riffs were great as ever and if not the entire album Kirk was sure as hell back in the 80\u2019s blasting out solos like there was no tomorrow. As for the negatives, Lars\u2019 performance and his drum work. He almost ruined it for me. The thing I was looking out for was James\u2019 voice and as expected he sounded different. He sounded way better than what he sounded on the last album and there were some moments on the song where he sounded really, really great. The next official release were the singles \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d and \u201cCyanide\u201d respectively. My Apocalypse, it seemed that the band had taken a leaf out of the book which they named as \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d and once again the pros and cons were the same. Great guitar work, awesome thrashy solo by Kirk, good bass and mediocre work by Lars are what can describe the track. Even though he sounded good for some time like during the first 30 seconds he sounds really bad after that. The second last official single was \u201cCyanide\u201d and I was over whelmed. This sounded so much better than the live version. Everyone, yes everyone including James (with respect to the vocals) and for a change even Lars did a great job on the drums. Now for the very first time I felt that the band actually come out with a release that would be up to the expectations of the millions of the fans. The last official single off this album was \u201cJudas Kiss\u201d which features 2 epic soloing and possibly the best, most catchy chorus the band has done since a long long time.\n\nWell as for the album as a whole, it honestly surprised me, as I wasn\u2019t expecting something this good. \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d was called the missing link between \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d and the album, \u201cMetallica\u201d by the band. This best describes the album because it the perfect blend of the technicality and guitar solo driven sound of the former album and the radio-friendly, catchiness of the Black Album. Tracks like \u201cAll Nightmare Long\u201d, \u201cBroken, Beat & Scarred\u201d, \u201cThat Was Just Your Life\u201d and \u201cThe Judas Kiss\u201d though embrace the technicality and complex song structures of the \u201cJustice Era\u201d infuse in the catchiness of the \u201cBlack Album Era\u201d be it in the form of riffs but mostly it is depicted in the form of the vocals and mostly during the chorus.\n\nThe album starts off with the track \u201cThat Was Just Your Life\u201d with a sound of a heart pumping, possibly the heartbeat of the millions of fans worldwide waiting for the most awaited album in recent history or maybe the band itself, who this time do not want to make a sequel to their last album. What follows this is mind-blowing, skull crushing, adrenaline pumping, ear splitting, signature Metallica, the Metallica we love. As one crushing riff follows another and the dual intricate soloing of Kirk and James hits the listener one can only try to sit down and not jump with joy to the fact that the band indeed have returned and not to the roots which they said when they made \u201cSt. Anger\u201d but the real old roots, to the \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d and \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d roots. Trujillo\u2019s bass is audible and awesome. Lars too plays extremely quick and fast, managing to keep with the speed picking of James, the love of which he has regained once more. This speed and aggression doesn\u2019t end here. With the same power and momentum starts the extremely heavy and catchy riff of \u201cThe End Of The Line\u201d. This too boasts of catchy riffs, intricate mixtures of solos and Rob\u2019s monster of a bass line. This multiplied by Lars\u2019 drum-work only makes the listener even more anxious for the track, which follows, \u201cBroke, Beat & Scarred\u201d. The evil track name is not let down by the track itself like its previous tracks is quite lengthy clocking in at near 7 minutes of pure unadulterated thrashiness. As James screams out the lyrics (Rise/ Fall Down/ Rise Again), it only brings to mind the possibility that this about the band itself aiming at their monumental rise and fall in the music industry, and as James says the words \u201cRise Again\u201d authoritatively you cannot but accept the fact that the band has like a phoenix from the ashes risen and is flying up high in the sky.\n\nThis is followed by the first single off of the album \u201cThe Day That Never Comes\u201d which is total worship of the heavy metal anthem \u201cOne\u201d right from the song structure, to the machine gun riffs as well as the music video which like \u201cOne\u201d is based on war. The track \u201cAll Nightmare Long\u201d is one of my favorite tracks on the release. The band described this album as something like \u201c\u2026 And Justice For All\u201d and this is the reason why. This song has a lot of transitions and I mean a lot of them including four different transitions in the first two minutes alone. Also there is this part on the track near the 5-minute mark where the band suddenly ups the already fast tempo and goes into another gear altogether. There is this crazy, insanely fast riff backed with Lars\u2019s double bass (yeah the old horse still has speed in those legs of his!) and this makes this memorable track even more memorable. \u201cCyanide\u201d starts off with a bang and ends with one too. The star of that track you ask? Rob Trujillo with the catchiest bass riff I\u2019ve heard in a long time. The track, which I was waiting for the most, was \u201cUnforgiven III\u201d and as expected it\u2019s the ballad on the album. This song is NOT anything like the previous two songs of its kind (Unforgiven and Unforgiven II). Why? Well, firstly, because it\u2019s way longer than any one and them and secondly and way more importantly the band uses pianos and violins on this track! Can you imagine that? The track starts off with a piano intro and also features violins at times during the track. It also features the longest solo on the album with Kirk playing it once using the wah-wah pedal and once without it. The instrumental \u201cSuicide & Redemption\u201d is pretty heavy for the first few minutes but the highlight of this track, which once again features Trujillo\u2019s meaty bass lines and Kirk and James dual solos is when the band suddenly takes it a bit slow and melodic. The track, which lasts almost ten whole minutes, ends with the solos of Kirk and the riffs of mass destruction by James. The last track is \u201cMy Apocalypse\u201d and is the thrashiest track here with the band taking a leaf out of the book which we all know as \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d. The solo in the track there once again by Kirk is the highlight there.\n\nNow I will briefly describe the positives and negatives of the album. As for the negatives, Lars\u2019 inconsistency in drumming and his drum set. Yeah he does dish out some pretty wicked drumming on the first three tracks of the album and \u201cThe Judas Kiss\u201d but this is pretty much it. The remainder of the time he just sounds crappy and out of sync with the whole band. Also, the drum kit of his even though doesn\u2019t have that \u201ctrash can\u201d sound isn\u2019t that great and it seems as if he is playing with is broken. The most important thing for a great album is that it always starts of with a bang and sure as hell ends with one. This album starts with an explosion but surely doesn\u2019t end with one. The last 35 seconds of the last track ruin the track and my opinion of the album. Had those final few seconds been edited or removed as a whole the track, the album would be better. So, is this the best album the band has done in twenty years? Yes. Is it the worst production the band has encountered in 20 years? Yes. The production is downright bad and something not expected of a man of caliber like Rick Ruben who has worked with the biggest names in the industry like Slayer, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Danzig and AC/DC. It would have so much better if the production would be better.\n\nAs for the positives, there are many. James\u2019 voice even though isn\u2019t great there are some moments and some tracks where he sounds really great. What he has lacked in vocals he has made up for while playing the guitar. He has regained his love for speed picking and has come up with crazy, in your face riffs. The band this time kept their word and unlike the last album really gone back to their roots. The true stars of this album though are Kirk and Rob. Kirk, it seems has been in hibernation since the last two decades and like a snake suddenly jumped on the prey with all its force and more. His has shredded his heart out and compiled brilliant solos be it using the wah-wah pedal or not. Rob and his bass is another thing, which is worth a mention. He has played his bass like a monster, come up with catchy, technical bass riffs and lines.\n\nThese drawbacks make what could have been a great album, into a good album. Despite all the precautions that were taken the album managed to leak in Paris when a shopkeeper there sold it before the scheduled date and as expected it spread like a fire in the forest on the net. I\u2019ll be honest and I confess that I downloaded the leak and heard it. Hell, I started the review on the 5th of September and the final draft ended on 7th, still five days before the scheduled release. I was really impressed by the album and even though I have the leaked version, I am now waiting for the 12th when I actually will be standing the queue waiting for a copy of this LP, as I sure will be buying it.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way right now: This isn\u2019t \u201cThe return of Metallica!\u201d. Some may well proclaim it as such, but no, it isn\u2019t. This isn\u2019t their 80s material again, though there are parts of it, as I shall come to. However, the more important mistake in the above proclamation is that they never left, and many need to remember that: Metallica have always been an ever-changing band, and continue to be such. Death Magnetic is, all told, a solid addition to their catalogue. It has some meh tracks that don\u2019t do much, it has some that are fantastic, and it has a lot of reliable, fun metal songs. Yes, metal, because that\u2019s one way in which you could say \u201cThey\u2019re back\u201d, in that this is the most \u201cmetal\u201d album they\u2019ve done in a long time. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s inherently the best, because \u201cmetal\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically equal \u201cgood\u201d, but as it happens I do personally think this is their best work since Black Album.\n\nStraight comparison with their 80s work is ridiculous, the band has long since moved on from that, and if anyone really expected a return to Lightning or Puppets, well more fool them. No one\u2019s really got an excuse to bash the band for not making \u201cPuppets II\u201d anymore. What they have done is very nicely put together all their past styles. There are elements of the thrashy Metallica, elements of the accessibility of Black Album, the southern-rocking of Load/Reload, and the rawness of St. Anger. I can see what they mean about a mid-point between Justice and Black Album too.\n\nA more valid comparison would be to the likes of Corrosion of Conformity or later Overkill, rock-tinted metal with emphasis on post-thrash groove riffs and smatterings of thrash in a less aggressive form. Also, if we are going to compare it to previous albums to give an idea of what it\u2019s like, the song structure is firmly between Justice and Black Album: it\u2019s got catchy choruses aplenty and a general verse-chorus structure, but in the style and riff-play feels more like Justice. The sound is closer to modern Metallica, with the rough edge of Load and St. Anger, but it doesn\u2019t have the bluesy meandering feel of Load and Reload, instead it feels more focused and set down in structure. It varies in pace, sometimes thrashing (yes, thrashing), sometimes working at a more mid-pace groove. The songs work well as a whole, because they feel much less jam-session than St. Anger, more planned and well produced (thanks I\u2019m sure in no small part to Rick Rubin, who\u2019s also done a smashing job with the mix, Rob is very much there and it all sounds clear). To call it a \u201cthrash metal\u201d album would be stretching it: there are some thrashers and plenty of faster riffs, but in all it doesn\u2019t fit that. But it\u2019s certainly a lot more so than Load or Reload. It\u2019s thrash-esque, done in the modern rock style, not quite as rock/accessible as Black Album, as the song lengths should tell you, but not with as much filler either.\n\nEnough general chatter though, a few specifics I think. The best bits: All Nightmare Long is great and thrashy, easily the best track on the album simply because it never stops working. It comes with a truly irresistible chorus (I don\u2019t care if the lyrics aren\u2019t great, it just fucking slays), solos that flow beautifully into it, and a simple yet effective pause before the final chorus that tops it all off nicely. Oh and bonus points for spotting the inserted section that many had already heard in the preview \u201cNew Songs\u201d. The other \u201cthrasher\u201d is My Apocalypse, although it\u2019s not as thrashy nor as effective as Nightmare, but it still delivers. In particular the mid-section is good, and between them Apocalypse and Nightmare add some much appreciated pace.\n\nThat Was Your Life is fun, the fast vocal delivery works well with the core riff, and James does great work in this song in particular. The guitar tone is excellent too, works very well at setting the album up. Judas Kiss is a mixed bag, with a good mid-section, great chorus and build, but it lags in between, with some of the riffing feeling somewhat wishy-washy. It feels a tad overly long, though not as much as the one that follows. The Unforgiven III will no doubt draw a lot of early pre-emptive criticism just for being called what it is. In truth, it actually doesn\u2019t sound anything like the previous two Unforgiven songs (as opposed to how similar those two sounded to one another), and it makes me wonder why they called it what they did. It\u2019s very much the soft piece of the album. James is good for it, his voice carries plenty of emotion, and uses the right inflections without sounding like he\u2019s crooning, and in all the song builds a lot better than Day That Never Comes, becoming progressively more powerful until Kirk lets rip with a gorgeous solo. In all, it\u2019s a good one, adding softer variety to the album without feeling crowbar-ed in.\n\nObviously the album is not without criticism or bad points though: at times the songs do feel like they go on a bit, the opening three tracks do drag to an extent: Broken, Beat & Scarred continues in the same manner as the two tracks before it, but while it has a good beat the lyrics just don\u2019t work; frankly, they\u2019re cringe-worthy. End of the Line is just fairly average, a groove-based rocker with an intro many should recognise from \u201cThe New Song\u201d. A few of the riffs are uninspired, it must be said: Cyanide, for example, is just plain boring, as many have already concluded from early youtube videos. Also, while Day That Never Comes is good, it doesn\u2019t work that well as an epic builder (a la One, Sanitarium, etc) because the flow from soft to heavy doesn\u2019t work so well, although it also feels like what they were aiming for and is less of a problem for the album as a whole when the other songs are taken into account (Unforgiven III provides more of the gradual building power).\n\nSuicide & Redemption is an odd one. In it\u2019s own right, there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but as the instrumental of the album it just doesn\u2019t work. It feels like just one of the other songs, with the vocals taken out. Instrumentals like Orion and Ktulu really FELT like instrumentals. They were great, meandering beasts that strode along confidently and immersed you, you couldn\u2019t add vocals to them, they worked in an inherently different way. S&R just doesn\u2019t have that, although there\u2019s nothing actually bad about the music, and around the 5 minute mark and the end, it does start to feel a bit better. It kind of illustrates that while the playing style on Death Magnetic is fine on it\u2019s own, it really doesn\u2019t work so well for a 10-minute instrumental.\n\nAll told, Death Magnetic delivers the goods, with the only really bad track being Cyanide, and plenty of goodness elsewhere. If nothing else, I don\u2019t think anyone could argue it\u2019s worse than St. Anger (and, as my review of that album suggests, I didn\u2019t even mind it much). It certainly suffers a few hiccups along the way, and is far from perfect. It\u2019s true James\u2019 vocals aren\u2019t as good as when he was young, but nor are most peoples\u2019, and like the more modern sound of the album, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise nor be worthy of criticism (using the same criticisms for album after album really doesn\u2019t work, sorry). As some have already noted, Kirk is not only very much back, but is making up for his lack of presence in St. Anger, with solos aplenty and most of them pretty good too.\n\nTo sum up: if you\u2019re expecting a return to 80s Metallica don\u2019t look here...actually, don\u2019t look anywhere, because it\u2019s not going to happen and you\u2019re a fool to expect it. If you haven\u2019t liked anything Metallica have done since then, this shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise to you and you\u2019ve no reason to act disappointed, indeed it's a puzzle why such folks still listen at all. If you didn\u2019t mind (or maybe even liked) Black Album and (Re)Load, then give it a whirl. Death Magnetic represents the next step in a band that is always evolving, and is a good solid blending of older style and influences with new, feeling much more refined and well laid-out than its predecessor. It still retains its aggression, but without the repetition, lack of variation between and weak flow of songs, and low production. A very good addition to their history, which sounds like a band just having fun naturally and doing what they do best.\n\nIs it one of the best metal albums of modern times? No. Is it one of Metallica\u2019s best overall? No. Is it one of their best of the past two decades, and the latter half of their discography? Why, yes. Drop preconceived notions about \u201cwhat Metallica is\u201d, and enjoy this album in it\u2019s own right, because there\u2019s plenty to enjoy. It\u2019s a fun ride, even if there isn\u2019t any lightning involved.\n",
        "\nThe Whiplash EP was a pretty decent EP for Metallica. It consisted of three original songs (Jump In The Fire, Seek And Destroy, and Phantom Lord) and also the special Neckbrace Remix version of Whiplash. I thought that Whiplash was a pretty amazing song to begin with, so when I heard that the Whiplash EP had a remix version of the song, I just had to check it out.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t much of a difference in the song. The lyrics are all the same, and so is the instrumental. When you listen to it though, you notice that the sound of the song is different. More reverb was added to the Neckbrace Remix. This created a greater echo effect when James Hetfield was singing. It was actually pretty cool to hear. Sadly other than that, there is nothing different from the original. Even Lars Ulrich has stated that there is no difference.\n\nI think that the Whiplash EP is a pretty cool EP. If you have the Kill \u2018Em All album, you\u2019re really not missing out on anything. If you are a serious fan like me though, you definitely won\u2019t regret buying this EP.\n",
        "\nS&M showcases a mellow Metallica; still a band that is able to experiment wisely and create a solid musical output no matter the circumstances. If one thing is certain, that is, Metallica have the ability to musically adapt to their environment and effectively deliver the goods no matter if that is done in an arena, stadium, underground joint or an orchestra setting even. \n\n\nMusically, Metallica seem to be at their top of their game as always. The setlist consists of several songs out of the Load-Reload era and as a result, it is more melodic-oriented than the typical Metallica setlist.\n\n\nThe band performs the songs well. Also, it is really nice how Michael Kamen (R.I.P.) writes parts that complement the various themes in the songs, and not simply copy the rhythmic or melodic line evident in each song. The result is rich in musicianship, power and dynamics. Personally, I dig most of the setlist here and the way the band and orchestra interact with each other. I do however need to highlight the fact that the songs of the Load-Reload period are mostly benefited by this collaboration. \u201cOutlaw Torn\u201d and \u201cBleeding Me\u201d are perfect examples. Both, proggy as they are in themes, melodies and arrangements, are uplifted by the orchestra\u2019s strong presence. Further, the orchestra adds to the song \u201cCall of Ktulu\u201d, which in this case sounds as a classical piece altogether. Other great examples of this successful musical merger are \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d and \u201cNo Leaf Clover\u201d. The latter especially cannot exist without the orchestra in the background, because the choruses are built on Hetfield\u2019s melodic vocals and the music provided by the orchestra. Finally, I find \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d to be one of the heavier songs that clearly gains from the presence of the orchestra. \n\n\nOne thing that definitely needs to be highlighted is James\u2019s vocal attempt. His voice is in superb form, and those who like Hetfield\u2019s melodic voice will absolutely love this performance. His voice is clean, powerful and full of dynamics. It goes low and it goes high and stays there. I find it to be the best melodic Hetfield I have heard ever and to go one step even further I have to admit that the S&M version of \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d is to this day the very best I have ever listened to; musically and vocally! \"Outlaw Torn\" and \"Bleeding Me\" are also included as top notch performances by Hetfield.\n\n\nOwning both the S&M dvd and cd I have to admit that the dvd totally adds to the experience, especially if one can listen to it and watch it using a solid 5.1 Dolby Digital system. The orchestra is much more heard in the dvd due to the visual help by the director and the audio form available. The interaction between the band and the orchestra can be felt only on the dvd in my opinion, where you can see Lars and Kamen exchanging looks, counting in songs and feeling the vibe of the night. Also, you can see how James interacts with his fellow musicians in the orchestra even applauding at them towards the end of \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d. Newsted can be seen near the orchestra bass players enjoying himself and\u2026 headbanging here and there and Kirk being close to and interacting with the strings section. All of them are feeling the night and all are living this unique experience to the fullest. Of course the orchestra lives this show in its own way, under the tight suits and robot-like movement; they too contribute to the visual-audio happening that is S&M. Great stuff if you ask me.\n\n\nHow about the negative side? Sure there are some songs that don\u2019t work that well with the orchestra. In that sense, Metallica could have formed an even better setlist for the occasion. For the record, I think that \u201cSad but True\u201d, \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d and \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d are not the best tracks to add an orchestral layer to. The same stands for \u201cHero of the Day\u201d. \u201cBattery\u201d isn\u2019t perfect material for this one either, but the intro and that alone sounds great and classical, played by the orchestra. It sounds as if it was written for an orchestra. I wonder why Metallica didn\u2019t use \u201cFade to Black\u201d, \u201cUnforgiven I\u201d or \u201cSanitarium\u201d for this purpose. And certainly Lars\u2019s explanation, that \u201cFade to Black\u201d is already classical as it is and wouldn\u2019t fit the orchestra, surely does not convince me (you can find that in the documentary). \n\n\nAs far as the technical aspects of this dvd are concerned, I must say that the direction is great and the cinematography dark and melancholic as it should be. The usual audio option, 5.1 Dolby Digital is there, but there is even more. One can hear the band or orchestra alone on a 2.1 surround option. Another great feature of this release is the ability the user has to choose the camera angle in four songs and do some \u201cediting\u201d also, as the users can move from one band member to the next whenever they please to. \n\n\nFurther, S&M includes the documentary around the specific gig and the thoughts of the band\u2019s members on this special event. Nice 40-minute documentary that is funny to watch and rather interesting as the band reveals how the idea for this kind of collaboration between Metallica and the orchestra existed from way back and of course how it came to life. In addition, the video for \"No Leaf Clover\" can be found here.\n\n\nAll in all, I think S&M makes for an intriguing listen and a quality-oriented one as well. Progsters should definitely check it out, but I\u2019m having doubts whether it could work with narrow-minded thrash metal fans. Open minded metal fans can appreciate it however, so give it a shot!\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s that time again boys and girls. We as thrash fans, as metal-heads, as sentient life-forms in general, find ourselves on the eve of a new Metallica album. With only a few mere days until the release, I\u2019d just like to remind readers of what happened the last time we all got hyped up over the latest Metallica disc. Though I remain optimistic, it\u2019s only because there\u2019s one Metallica album that I\u2019m positive Death Magnetic will be heads and tails above; their controversial St. Anger of 2003.\n\nA lot of people having been constructing positive interpretations of this album of late. As such, many of your individual experiences with this long-awaited \u201ccomeback\u201d album are probably different from mine, but maybe some of you can relate. My experience with St. Anger came in three stages.\n\nStage one was Confusion. I had heard the first single off the album (the title track) a few weeks prior to purchasing the album. It wasn\u2019t magnificent, but hell, it wasn\u2019t that bad either. Certainly not bad enough to discourage me from getting the album. I had to take a flight back from Denver to Philadelphia which was to last several hours, so I figured that the album would be an easy way to pass the time. About half-way into the first run through, I began to notice that something was amiss. There were no dazzling Kirk Hammett guitar solos to bring my senses to climax. Nor were there any trademark Metallica riffs. In fact, there wasn\u2019t much of anything: everything sounded low-fi and sludgy. Listening to it on my sound system at home proved that it wasn\u2019t the headphones: St. Anger just sounded shitty. Metallica wasn\u2019t supposed to sound shitty, in fact, they were supposed to sound quite the opposite (an early magazine review of the album gave it a pretty favorable review too). As I struggled to come to terms with what I was hearing, I slowly moved into stage two: Denial.\n\nSlowly but surely, I found myself convinced that St. Anger wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as I initially concluded. In fact, some of the songs were downright cool. Hetfield\u2019s frantic, screechy screams (found all over the place) seemed energetic, songs like \u201cShoot Me Again,\u201d \u201cPurify\u201d and \u201cDirty Window\u201d had heavy, pummeling riffs, and there were a nice batch of lyrical nuggets I found to my liking. I tried hard to find the good in the album and I succeeded: for a period of time I actually legitimately enjoyed the album. This wasn\u2019t meant to be, however, and after much more scrutiny I moved into the third and most inevitable stage: Anger.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Metallica returning to form, they were merely pulling the same trend-hopping bullshit they pulled back with Load but with a nu-metal flavor. Metallica had sold out, again. Hearing the album as it really was, I became massively disenfranchised and completely pissed that I blew $16 on this fucking shitstorm. I shelved it in dismay, listening to it only once more at the request of a friend to find that it had only grown worse with time. \n\nWas this the album\u2019s true purpose after all? As an expression of Metallica\u2019s own anger, was it designed to extend that feeling to their audience? Indeed, I sympathize with those that consider the album avant-garde. Such an intentionally vitriolic album would have the merits of an artistic masterwork. But I don\u2019t buy albums to display as conversation pieces; I buy them to listen to. And if an album\u2019s listenability is crippled in order for it to be artistically relevant\u2026well\u2026I\u2019ll reflect it in my review.\n\nBut now listening to the album for the first time in years; objectively, disregarding all past bias and disappointment and generally not comparing it to past Metallica albums, I can still honestly say that the album is terrible. The song arrangements are notoriously basic, yet regularly drag on for 7-8 minutes. Hetfield sounds terrible when he tries to vocalize anything outside of mellow singing or a low snarl (he falls apart during the \u201cFrantic\u201d chorus, the end of \u201cAll Within My Hands\u201d, etc.) and his guitar sound sucks (tuned to Drop-C, the same tuning utilized by System of a Down, but with a shittier distortion). There are no guitar solos and only a handful of spots where the guitars aren\u2019t doing the exact same thing, so Kirk didn\u2019t even really have to play on this album. Lars\u2019 return to aggressive drumming is a major plus (parts of \u201cSt. Anger\u201d and elsewhere), but as everyone knows, his kit was so poorly recorded (not just the snare, people) that it strangles the tempo. Rob Trujillo is a great bassist, but Bob Rock wrote/recorded all the bass lines (read: copied the guitar lines) and mixed them into obscurity. Additionally, the lyrics are infantile and angsty, which along with the low-tuned guitars and lack of solos, brings the album just on the periphery of nu-metal territory (only the drumming keeping a semblance of metal intact). \n\nBut however marginally it may appear, Metallica\u2019s chemistry is nonetheless still present on the album. Once the shocking disappointment fades away, the album\u2019s critical problems become limited to these three: the drum production, the lack of guitar solos, and the low-tuning. The drum production is the worst of the three: this is the reason the album feels so sluggish. Had even this alone been addressed, I could realistically see scoring this over 50%, as several of the songs would then become quite solid. Maybe then the final stage of the St. Anger experience is really Complacency: acceptance with what the band attempted to express to their listener has come with time. But it is the way they chose to express it that continues to trouble me, hence this single-digit slap to the face.\n\nPerhaps Death Magnetic will indeed redeem this long misguided band. We\u2019ll find out shortly, but until then, Metallica in my eyes remain unforgiven.\n",
        "\nFinally, after several Metallica releases a new song. Many people are curious about this new Metallica. The fans from the 80s, the fans from St. Anger, the all around fans, everyone wants to know how it is. For me, it's exactly what I hoped it would be. So why don't I rate it 100%? This is why:\n\nThough The Day That Never Comes is a great song, it has some negative stuff there also. The snare drum sounds better than it did on St. Anger, but please God they shouldn't make it that loud! The bass drum on the other hand sounds perfect to my ears! ...And Justice For All all over again! It's great to see Metallica back in track, back in the Metal. When the solo kicks in, you can't figure out why the fuck Metallica made shit like St. Anger, Load, Reload and self-titled album Metallica. Don't get me wrong, I (kinda) like the albums, but they're not Metallica-material. Shit like this, this is Metallica!\n\nThis is a song that, the more you listen to it, the better it gets! trust me, the first time I heard it, I would've rated it not more than 75%. Yet I rated it 85% now, Tomorrow I might think a 90% of it! The reason why this is a great song is in 2 words: Roberto Trujillo! My opinion: he saved Metallica. But they're all back now, Hammett, Hetfield and even Ulrich! \n\nThe song starts very slow, nice guitar, nice drum, everything is fine in Metallicaland. Then the lyrics kick in, I guess half of the people who will ever hear this will say: shit! But not me, Hetfield is not 25 anymore, the guy's older, make your peace with it. To me, he's doing a great job doing what he does now. Ulrich's fills are incredible, same for his bass kicks. Tune the snare drum bit more, make it less noisy, and you have Lars back from ...AJFA! Selfless Kirk stays modest throughout the first half of the song. But when the fast riffs come up and the solo starts, it's Hammett-time! A fast, melodic and great solo from the Kirkmaster! I can't believe this Metallica once was gone, but the most important is that they're back. Trujillo brings the old Metallica-vibe back in Metallica, and this song is a great example. \n\nPos: \n- Trash Metal all over again\n- Solo's are back\n- Bad ass riffs\n- Lars' bass drum and fills\n- Hetfield's voice is different from old stuff\n\nNeg:\n- Hetfield's voice is different from old stuff\n- Lars' snare drum is too loud.\n\nYou probably noticed that I put Hetfield's voice in both pos and neg. That's not by accident, it's negative because his voice really ruled in the early days, but it's also positive because it's a change, change ain't necessarily bad. Maybe at first, but we'll get used to it. This is the new Metallica, and if you don't like it, it ain't their problem, they already have enough money so they don't need you really! \nMetal Up Your Ass!\n",
        "\nThe usual road taken in metal circles in dealing with Metallica of late is to either jump to their defense, or to spout out the four letter words and elaborately grotesque metaphors like no tomorrow. I\u2019ve been mostly guilty of the latter, primarily because I\u2019d followed the band since 1989, and even during my Kurt Cobain phase they were on my A list. But as time has gone by, I\u2019ve become better acquainted with the nature of the music industry, and have begun to understand why bands like Anthrax, Sepultura and Slayer decided to turn in their thrash metal chips in exchange for a new, groovy kind of game. I\u2019m not taking back any of my comments regarding their past material, because it still revolts my ears with the exact same intensity, and because I\u2019ve seen true metal bands who are content to keep a day job and play small venues for a few hundred dollars rather than change their sound to keep the arenas full.\n\nSo as to this particular song and its connection to all of this, it\u2019s basically another fit of compliance with the music industry and mainstream culture. I\u2019m fairly certain that all Lars had to do was hear a few snippets of Machine Head\u2019s \u201cThe Blackening\u201d to get his cue for it being alright to revisit some of the older elements of Metallica\u2019s extensive history, and this songs comes off like a disingenuous attempt at straddling the gap between the old school thrash fans who started giving them grief in 1991 and the alternative rock junkies who ate up the Load albums. In some respects it has already achieved what it was meant to do, and that was fool people into thinking that Metallica had reestablished their thrash sound, as well as to bring back the epic ballad style that was first brought out on \u201cFade To Black\u201d. Sure it\u2019s way better than any song on \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, just like \u201cThe Blackening\u201d was miles ahead of \u201cThe Burning Red\u201d or \u201cSupercharger\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t make it good.\n\nAll you need to do is focus on the opening riff in order to hear the huge disconnect between this and anything Metallica did in the 80s. At best, it\u2019s a cheap imitation of something off of \u201cLoad\u201d, if not a semi-plagiarized U2 guitar line. Don\u2019t let the frequent lead breaks and heavily improved quality of Kirk\u2019s playing fool you, there isn\u2019t a true metal foundation to speak of beneath the quasi \u201cFade To Black\u201d aura of the first 50 seconds of this. Afterward what ensues is a slightly better version of \u201cThe Unforgiven II\u201d which has a similar vocal sound out of James. At about half way through this things start to pick up and we have some riffs to speak of, although things don\u2019t really get going until the 5 minute mark. I have to say, they do get going pretty nicely when Kirk\u2019s shred lines come in, including the riff work underneath all the clusters of rapid notes.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this song is the production, particularly the drum production. Although it\u2019s not quite as blatant as on the previous debacle, Lars\u2019 drums still sound utterly terrible. The snare has very little punch to it, and even less sustain. Essentially he traded in his trash can lid sound for something in between a cardboard box and a 5 gallon bucket. The cymbals tend to be overpowering, while the bass drum has barely enough presence to compete with the high end nature of the song. The guitar sound mostly resembles the non-muddy, but weaker distorted tone heard on the Load albums, while the bass has largely been buried under the drums and guitars. Basically Kirk\u2019s lead tracks are the only ones on here that aren\u2019t in need of a serious overhaul, though I should note that Kirk has made a big step by finally freeing himself from his wah pedal addiction.\n\nSo the final verdict on this song is mostly a failing one. There isn\u2019t much to write home about other than some of the riffs during the 2nd half of the song and Kirk\u2019s leads, which don\u2019t make the first 4 minutes of the song worth listening to. If this song indicates anything, it is the culture of compromise divorced from principle that Metallica has continually exhibited since the beginning of the 1990s. At best, this album could maybe resemble their self-titled release, though a poorly mixed version of it at that. I can say that this song is metal for the most part, but it\u2019s not the kind of metal that I\u2019d recommend blowing money on. Maybe the next single will be better, but when it comes to Metallica, it is yet another thing I wouldn\u2019t invest the fruits of the sweat of your brow over.\n\nLater Submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on September 1, 2008.\n",
        "\n\"The Day That Never Comes\" is the first official Metallica song since 2003's infamous St. Anger which marked the band's descent into muddy depths of nu-metal. Many have since hoped for a comeback in glory. What's the result?\n\nNot bad. Not bad at all. We are yet to hear the whole Death Magnetic album so we'll see how much of a comeback it is. For now, let's concentrate on the song.\n\n1. Construction - over 7 minutes long, similar to \"One\". The song begins with an almost poppy melody (a pretty one), builds up, and goes berserk after the second chorus. It has a pretty long solo, some dual guitars in vein of Thin Lizzy or Maiden. The riffs might seem a bit out of place on the first listening but after a while you get used to them. Ends like \"One\", in a high point.\n\n2. Music - it's definitely reminiscent of the 80s power ballads \"Fade to Black\" and an already mentioned classic, \"One\". Many people say the first part sounds Load-ish but I don't really hear this. For me this song would easily fit in between Justice and the Black album. The best thing about this song is that it no longer stays in a comfort zone of pentatonic minor scales (Re/Load) and has an actual MELODY in it and not some retarded, muddy, simplified playing (St. Anger). We\u2019re back to palm muting and \u2013 simply \u2013 interesting guitar work. If you\u2019re a guitarist you\u2019ll find a pleasure of playing along with the song and discovering the order of the riffs (at least I did). Metallica has recorded the most interesting song since 1991, and I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. Drums sound OK, no more retarded St. Ringing sound. \n\n3. Delivery \u2013 let\u2019s start with vocals. Many people are bitchslapping Hetfield for this song but for me it\u2019s his best effort since 1991. His vocal delivery is way better than St. Anger and way more interesting than Loads. He manages to pull off the high notes quite well for his age (remember, he\u2019s 45!). James\u2019 riffs are fun, too, as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier. Kirk left his wah pedal in the corner and finally did a decent heavy metal solo. Good job, Kirk. Rob\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I can barely hear the bass and I can\u2019t hear what he\u2019s doing back there. Granted, he\u2019s a great bassist and he proved it with Infectious Grooves, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t hear him well in this song. Maybe he\u2019ll shine on the final album. Now we come to the lowest point \u2013 Lars. I have nothing against him personally (I don\u2019t care for the whole Napster fiasco) but I have to admit his drumming in TDTNC is the most plain and boring (or \u201cstock\u201d as Lars himself would say) drumming I\u2019ve heard in a long time. His fills are mostly just hitting the snare drum couple of times and his beats are really uncreative. Maybe he\u2019s supposed to stay in the back while the guitars take control but his playing is very weak anyway. \n\nLyrics are nice, nothing special really. Definitely nowhere near \u201cOooh, what a good boy you are\u201d whining crap or \u201cGimme fuel, gimme fire\u201d cheesy stuff. There\u2019s more emotion this time and it feels good with the music (especially the chorus).\nConclusion: It\u2019s not mind-blowing but it\u2019s interesting, melodic, and decent. Perhaps I\u2019m a Metallica fanboy and I like it because it\u2019s Metallica? \u201cThe Day That Never Comes\u201d is a very good song and I\u2019m eager to hear it in context of the whole album in September.\n",
        "\nThus are the true-to-life words uttered by the great Brian Griffin, and how apt they are when pertaining to anything found to be less than extraordinary. Problems with politics? Bitch in a blog about it. Problems with a band or album? Complain on blabbermouth.net. Problems with just about EVERYTHING? That's why we have chatrooms and message boards. Either way, mindless whimperings have more than enough media to get the word spread, however asinine and worthless they may be, and since Hell hath no fury like a metal-head scorned, plentiful negatisms surrounding METALLICA's new single are appearing in fervent droves here, on myspace, facebook, what have you, in such quantities that I'm personally looking for Noah's second ark. It's a simple solution, after all...just go on the internet and complain. And complain about others complaining. Either way, you HAVE to be heard!\n\nAnd for the record, I'm not complaining about complaints...I'm just telling it like it is.\n\nAnyway, onto this new song...I never thought I'd review anything METALLICA's done, not out of impure hatred (I can't say I hate the band), but because nothing METALLICA has done has blown me away (and believe me, there are a LOT of other bands out there who are worse than Hetfield and Co. and worth our ire), this being no exception. It's also how I feel about other bands of their ilk, like IRON MAIDEN, MOTORHEAD, JUDAS PRIEST, DIAMOND HEAD (though I find them most irksome and definately NOT worth obsession), and whatnot; I respect what they do, but it's just not for me. I also won't go on the record spouting abhorrent vitriol against the band for \"selling out\", or being \"gay\", or other pop-culture bullshit; I can let the sheep do that for me...at the end of the day, METALLICA doesn't really thrill me, but at the same time, doesn't bother me. And when it comes to this new track, however, it doesn't do anything to rid me of these feelings, and at its best comes across as competantly performed and tolerable, but ultimately two-dimensional, like the rest of their discography. I've heard better, but I've also heard far worse (H.I.M. and LORDI come to mind, with homicidal thoughts), and if it were played on the radio, or as background music in a social gathering I won't leap to my feet in attentive rage wanting the band dead. But I will agree with a few reviews on one aspect...this IS better than anything off \"St. Anger\", and definately isn't as funny.\n\nSo, in the end, \"The Day That Never Comes\" isn't the second coming of Christ a few METALLI-fans believe it to be, nor is it an epitaph for a band so many wish to see fall, like others believe it to be. It's just a song, that's all...and how it inspires works of hellish teeth-grinding baffles me to no end.\n",
        "\nAbout the time St. Anger was about to be released, I remember feeling a sense of hope, as many in the press were claiming said album to be \"the return of Metallica's old school sound\". Obviously, as history will show you, I was young and gullible. Subsequently, St. Anger's \"sound\" (read: ill-executed bowel movement / successful cash grab) was certainly not the one prophesied by the masses. After listening to St. Anger once, I swiftly sold the quasi-mint condition album on eBay (Metallica's inquisition of lawyers would not approve, I'm sure). Metallica, it seems, had fooled me again.\n\nEnter the year of our lord 2008, and I'm still listening to nothing more recent than AJFA, as far as Metallica is concerned. So there's been talk (for how many years now I don't know) of a new album coming out later in the year, and THIS ONE, not St. Anger, is supposed to be the winning ticket. Months pass, and finally there is a taste-test available in the form of \"The Day That Never Comes\" (TDTNC). Still ashamed at my past gullibility, yet quietly intrigued nonetheless, I give in and decide to listen to the track. \n\nThe song opens with a crystalline guitar melody, over which a particularly retro sounding lead repeats over the top. It vaguely reminds me of Orion. At this premature point, I am unsure what to make of it. This could go one of two ways: up or down. With the advent of the following Load-style riff, my heart stops for the next 37 seconds, and then starts again but sinks as James starts singing, and I figure we must be going down. The singing is a la Until It Sleeps, and so I fear that this song will progress in a similar alt-rock manner: verse / chorus / verse / chorus / lead bridge / chorus. Thankfully, I was wrong.\n\nAround the four minute mark - right when I'm expecting a lead bridge to appear and bore me into a final ad nauseum reprise of the chorus - an up-beat, chunky, Black Album-esque riff draws my attention. Not bad. James aggressively spits out a few more lines; nothing special, but not as bad as when he's crooning. The riff is nice though, but I don't give in to optimism just yet: I don't expect any semblance of metal riffery after this, but perhaps a return to that Load style chorus...\n\n...But hang on a second! What's this at the 4:55 mark? Instead of resorting to the the slow lull of the verse and chorus, the beat actually doubles in speed, and Lars plays a classic punk-ish NWOBHM D-beat. The riffs that follow made me eat my pants. Actual decent metal riffs in a new Metallica song, praise Allah. While the riffs themselves are not particularly complex, the beauty lies in their arrangement from this point onwards. A hammer-on / pull-off riff appears which makes me think of Am I Evil by Diamond Head or Bach's Fugue and Toccata. So far, so good (...so what?).\n\nThe cynicism loosens its grip dramatically at 6:30, when to my surprise Kirk lets loose on the upper reaches of his fret board. There is no wah-wah, no tired blues pentatonics, no gimmicks, just frenetically charged metal licks (am I dreaming?). Admittedly, there is a bit of recycling going on here. Like for example, at 6:40 to 6:41, there is a descending run that I swear is identical to a part in the solo from The Shortest Straw. Nevertheless, the arrangement after the solo is particularly worthy of recognition. The last minute of the track is by far the most aggressive and epic bunch of sounds released by Metallica in about 20 years. I must say I like the way it ends, right at the top of the ride, so to speak. \n\nJust quickly, my main criticisms would be the apparent lack of bass, and James' weak vocals, particularly over the clean verse/chorus. The drums are nothing special, but serve their purpose and keep the beat I guess. If only the first half of this song was as good as the second, I would've given it a much higher mark. The two halves seem a bit too disparate to each other with respects to mood and tempo.\n\nTo summarise, TDTNC is quite a decent song as far as modern Metallica goes. With this song, they have shown that they are still capable of writing music that progresses on the strengths of their earlier material, without 1) cloning their former 80's sound, and/or 2) creating something so radically different that it cannot even be compared to their former material. Still, time will tell whether this material will have a lasting impression on me or not, and I will withhold my proclamation of \"welcome back thrash legends\" or any such nonsense until I hear the entire album of Death Magnetic. Until then, TDTNC at least hints at a potential (and perhaps gradual) reawakening within the members of Metallica: It's time to finally lay Alt-Rocktallica and Nu-Metallica to rest.\n",
        "\nSo today I was just browsing on YouTube and sure enough, saw a link for the new Metallica single, \"The Day That Never Comes\". I have a long history with Metallica...they were one of my earliest introductions to metal music (in 8th grade, shortly after getting into Iron Maiden and Judas Priest in 7th grade), \"Master of Puppets\" was my soundtrack to that particular school year. However, as I immersed myself in heavy metal music at an even greater extent in the months and years that followed I strayed from my origin point a bit. Certainly, discovering Metallica's atrocious post 'Black Album' catalog was incredibly disappointing, and I was appalled to find that the band members had cut their hair as well (oh the innocent days). \n\nEven though today Metallica is far from my favorite band, I still hold their early material in high regard due to it's nostalgic value to me and simply because it is quality and truly quite revolutionary music. So when I hear that the bands forthcoming release, \"Death Magnetic\", is widely anticipated to be their return to their thrash metal roots, of course the 8th grader in me who just watched the 'Frantic' video on YouTube and felt as if he had just witnessed his father cheat on his mother was absolutely thrilled. However, I always kept in my mind that hint of realism, \"they did St. Anger\", and sur eenough when I became aware of the fact that a full studio quality song from the band would be available online today, naturally I went to check it out, and... \n\n...well, it is better than St. Anger. However it fails to be much more than that. It opens with and intro that sounds if it could have been lifted from a Modest Mouse album, and with a rather uninspired Kirk Hammett intro solo in the vein of Fade to Black and Sanitarium over top. So far not impressed; An acoustic verse riff is more promising, but it is immediately ruined by James Hetfields horrid post-Y2K vocals. To his credit, he does hold back much of his annoyingness here, but he simply sounds like the rest of the song, bland and dull. I could review the lame and contrived chorus, the uninspired and rather dull instrumental break, and the absolutely random and pointless solo break, but I will just leave it at this...Metallica tries to return to their roots, but is simply uninspired and sounds bland and dull.\n\nI almost couldn't believe this was Metallica when I first heard this. Even in their most insipid, horrid musical moments, they always at least sounded enthusiastic and inspired. While musically this may surpass some of these moments, on here, Metallica simply trys too hard to sound like their early material, and it works against them in the long run. So, alas, Metallica continues their status as \"sell outs\" in my book, and with quite a good deal of quality releases in metal this year from the likes of Meshuggah, Opeth, Decrepit Birth, Arsis, Into Eternity, Testament, Iced Earth and others to enjoy...I personally will be saving some money this fall. Hey, in todays economy that\u2019s what\u2019s smart to do.\n\nP.S. - Megadeth with Chris Broderick is poised to destroy this.\n",
        "\nThere's an old saying that you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Metallica are old and set in their ways. Since pretty much the time Hetfield quit copping Mustaine riffs, Metallica has had a way of writing songs that, with time, proved faulty. Metallica write songs for public consumption. Metallica took thrash and commercialized it, and when thrash quit being popular, they quit being thrash. Now that metal is experiencing an upsurge in popularity, Metallica decided that they suddenly remember how to play metal. \n\nThe problem is, this isn't much of a change from previous efforts. It's made with the same mindset as everything they've made since Master of Puppets. And that is, that it's more important to be what's popular than to BE YOURSELF. Musically, it's like a Metallica ballad, which means you have James embarrassing himself with poor singing that he wasn't meant to do, Kirk sounding out of place playing music that he's not meant to play, and Lars ESPECIALLY sounding out of place because he doesn't know how to do anything but simple bass-snare patterns. If he steps out of that archetype, he sounds awkward and forced. The songwriting is cliche'd, basic shit that grew stale when they sold out stadiums after ...And Justice For All. It's full of chord progressions that reek of ballad stereotypes, assembled with no attention to coherence, and since the point of a ballad is to be heartfelt, it feels infuriatingly fake. You can't fake emotion, and this is 100% manufactured emotion. \n\nThe point of this is that you can't contrive metal without losing the metallic qualities. James and co. might be more metal than last time, but that is not a guarantor of quality. This is contrived as hell, sounding as fake, manufactured, and plastic as the last 3 efforts, and it appears nothing has changed. \n\nI think it's time to admit Metallica are done for. They're knackered and old, and haven't made any progress musically since the black album 18 years ago, and from the sound of this, they're not going to get their \"fire\" back anytime soon. Kirk, bless his heart, has settled in his style, and really can't do anything but basic amelodic wah abuse. Lars stinks up the recording with his drumming, but he was never a good drummer anyway. Still, the least Rubin could've done would be to mix the drums down, but we still have the \"clank clank clank\" from St. Anger, albiet not QUITE as annoying. James plays rhythm guitar as James does, as most dinosaurs from the 80's do, but it's worth mention that he can't sing worth a shit these days. It's painfully out of tune and crackly, and, let's face it, he's not the same James that sang on their first 4 efforts. A major disappointment is that they're still practicing the habit they acquired on ...And Justice in which they make the bass inaudible. \n\nI wouldn't call this a disappointment because it's better than I expected (I was expecting to throw an insta-zero on this, or at most a 30) and it's a lot more coherent and listenable than its predecessors. It's still nowhere near good, and Metallica have a lot more ground to cover before they can regain their past glory. Of course, Metallica were never truly excellent. There were much better thrash bands from the same scene (and some from other scenes) that I know of, and I'm not even a thrash fanatic. But even taking their past successes, failures, and general legacy out of the equation, The Day That Never Comes is still limp dicked and disappointing. Metallica might get their fire back some time in the future, but this won't be that time.\n",
        "\nOh god, I purchased this mini-EP from the iTunes store the other day for a mere 3 dollars, thinking since the proceeds go to a 'good cause', this can't be too bad of a waste. The three songs present here are, in their original studio forms, fairly good and catchy tracks from the Black Album, but on this live EP, recorded in mid-2007, they are a complete disaster. The heavyness of the music has been compromised in favour of a 'softer' sounding mix (probably to appeal to the non-thrashers present there), Sad But True sounds completely castrated. The clean guitars during Nothing Else Matters and the into of Sandman are lacking the necessary low-end to give them the distinctive Metallica sound. However, the instrumental performance is decent, but the guitars\nare really buried in the mix behind the loud drums and vocals.\n\nNow, in comparison to the vocals, the weak production is insignificant. James truly sounds awful, just listen to Sad But True and hear him buff several notes while yelling like a drunk. The following two tracks are \nalso performed with the same half-assed vocals, which totally takes away from the songs, especially the chorus of Sandman which is supposed to go BOOM! but instead just kinda lets out a little squeaking fart. \n\nEven though this was only three dollars, I am very unsatisfied with my purchase. I was not expecting something outstanding, considering the song selection is as banal as it gets from Metallica's catalogue, but it does surprise me that Metallica would actually release this crap sounding the way it does. If you want to donate to charity, go ahead and do it; there are several ways to do that without having to download this terrible EP.\n",
        "\nIt was hard to listen to this song without simply thinking \u201cThere\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to be good\u201d\u2026 really, do we even need to discuss the history of how much this band has pissed off fans of heavy metal again? Nevertheless, I was determined to give this song a fair chance and I did. The result however is not good. This song is an utter and complete mess.\n\nAlright, we begin with clean guitars and a fairly nice melody. Basically it sounds like the tolerable parts of Load but we\u2019re completely assaulted with a shitty unfitting drumbeat from Ulrich\u2026 unfortunately the absence of tolerable drums (notice how I\u2019m not even asking for good drumming, just something tolerable!) keeps coming throughout the song. I remember one of the \u201cFly on the Wall\u201d clips from Metallica\u2019s website which turns out was from the recording of this song. I laughed my ass off at Lars Ulrich saying something to the effect of \u201cWhile the bass holds down the beat I can do some interesting fills on the drums!\u201d His idea of interesting fills here turns out to be nothing more than rolling the snare drum on 16th beats\u2026 revolutionary!!! I won\u2019t even bother speaking about Ulrich\u2019s shitass drumming anymore. It\u2019s shit as always, that\u2019s all you need to know.\n\nHetfield\u2019s lyrics\u2026 well, he recently said in an interview that he likes to keep his lyrics vague these days so that people can make their own interpretation and find their own meaning. Wow, real fucking creative. After reading the lyrics to this song I estimate roughly 43 billion possible things this song could actually be about. I believe what Hetfield is trying to say is \u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m doing so I\u2019m writing random ass shit that people might find some meaning to\u201d. Oh yeah, did I mention Hetfield\u2019s singing is as shit as it was on Sergeant Anger? Yeah, shit.\n\nNow, all shitty singing and drumming aside, this song is a complete mess. Basically it\u2019s Until It Sleeps + One + A Retarded Solo + Some mediocre riffing. And what does this equation equal? Shit. That\u2019s what. You heard right, Metallica has simply glued together a bunch of old ideas into an 8 minute shitstorm. Soft Until It Sleeps first section. Then we get into the \u201cheavy\u201d One double kick type part, although here Ulrich only gives us the slowest power metal drum beat ever recorded. Add a dash of mediocre riffing. Cue Hammet\u2019s crappy amateur solo (more on this later) and we end with some more mediocre riffing. I actually have a strong mental image of James Hetfield cutting up the tapes from Metallica\u2019s jamming sessions over the past 13 years (or however long it\u2019s been since their last shitty album) and sticky taping the best parts together. Well, at least the parts him and Ulrich deemed to be the best.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk solos. Allow me to begin by saying that Hammet has done an excellent job of maintaining his reputation as a horrible lead guitarist. Hammet has two modes. One is \u201cBasic Blues Scale Soloing\u201d. The other is \u201cTapping Retardation\u201d. And Hammet doesn\u2019t disappoint his fans here! He delivers with a delightful combination of both of his soloing modes with the sheer mastery of a 14 year old that\u2019s been playing the guitar for an astonishing 3 months! Well done Hammet, you truly deserve your place in all those retarded internet \u201cTop 10 Guitarists of All Time\u201d lists ahead of such mediocre hacks like K.K Downing, Glenn Tipton, Tony Iommi, Kai Hansen, Rolf Kasparek and many more\u2026 please note that this paragraph is highly sarcastic.\n\nSo there you have it. A bunch of ideas that simply don\u2019t fit together, coupled with the horrid combination of Hetfield singing, Ulrich drumming and Hammet soloing. This is Metallica\u2019s big return to form? This is them returning to heavy metal? No, this is pure fucking shit. It would be a mediocre song if the solo, drumming and singing were done by musicians with a shred of talent left in them. If this is Hetfield, Ulrich and Hammet\u2019s idea of heavy metal then they are so out of touch with heavy metal these days that it\u2019s making me my laugh my ass off. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud at several parts of this song while giving it a few listens. I\u2019m only giving it 3% because I laughed hard at about 3 parts of the song. Otherwise it\u2019d be a big 0%! The Day That Never Comes and Death Magnetic\u2026 a parody of metal music.\n",
        "\nI should start out by saying that it's really hard to discern whether \"The Day that Never Comes\" is good or not by just reading the reviews if you have not heard the song. On one hand, you've got people that would have trashed this song no matter how good it is, just because they already had their minds made up before they even heard it. Similar to this are the people who will trash this single if it isn't a full-on thrash song, which it isn't. On the other hand, there are the die-hards that feel Hetfield is one of the finest vocalists in metal and that albums like \"Load\" and \"St. Anger\" were great albums in their own right because they were \"what the band needed to write at that point in time\" or some BS like that. Still others, like me, are cautiously optimistic, but even our opinions are biased to a certain extent. Thankfully for you, the reader, \"The Day The Never Comes\" is available for streaming, or at least can be found on the web without much effort. \n\nI could write a short review and say that \"The Day\" is a mix between \"The Unforgiven\" and \"One,\" and that would actually be very accurate. The song is structured like \"One;\" it starts out soft and melodic and halfway through becomes much heavier. The words end and give way to a good number of riffs and solos for the end of the song. The melodic first half and the vocal lines, as well as the lyrics, are reminiscent of \"The Unforgiven.\" \n\nHowever, to say that \"The Day That Never Comes\" is just a rehash of two older hits would be unfair and diminish what Metallica has accomplished. Just because the song is evocative of their past doesn't mean that this is just a duplicate of previous works; this song stands tall in its own light, and not just because it was preceded by one of the worst metal albums ever written. \n\nThe riffs themselves are not thrash, but they're heavy, and fairly plentiful. Some are simpler than others, but they all fit into the context of the song and benefit the song as a whole. The solo by Kirk Hammett is probably the greatest aspect, however. The first positive is that it is even there, and following closely is that he does not use the wah pedal, nor does he attempt to write another damn pseudo-blues solo like most of his other solos in the past 13 years. One surprising, yet encouraging facet is how the lead and rhythm guitars interact with each other. Even in Metallica's heyday, it seemed that aside from the occasional riff that Hammett wrote, Hetfield wrote most of the rhythm parts while Hammett would do the solos. This worked well at times, but also led to disjointed progressions as well. Throughout the heavy second half, however, there is a cohesiveness between the two guitarists that shows that the band is still evolving. \n\nI also feel Hetfield's vocals were pretty good up until the Black Album tour when he blew out his vocal cords, then tried to start singing. Here he isn't bad, but he certainly isn't great. Still, this is his best performance in 15 years, but that isn't saying much. Ulrich and Trujillo play just well enough to not be a detriment, but there's nothing worth mentioning between the two other than that the drums do not sound awful.\n\nIn fact, the actual production job is really good, I was afraid this would sound as awful as some of Rubin's other works, but everything is clear and balanced. That being said, the sound on the single my radio station received sounds terrible. There are parts that are scratchy, with some distortion and even clipping. I really hope that this is just a fault of the copy I received and not what the actual song will sound like on the album. \n\nOverall, \"The Day That Never Comes\" is a definite step in the right direction for Metallica. They have overcome the lousy songwriting mindset of their previous few albums, yet refused to just rewrite their older songs from the 80's. It is a sign that in addition to be relevant in pop-culture, that they are artistically relevant as well. Here's hoping that this is an accurate indication that \"Death Magnetic\" will be the return that Lar$ has been claiming.\n",
        "\nThis album seems to be caught between two eras for sure, that is their old one and new one (thrash, versus nu-metal). When I stay stuck between, I don't mean it lands in the 90's and sounds like Load/Reload. This is obvious that they're trying to get back to their thrash roots... while keeping the nu metal edge. That is what ruins this SP. They kept the nu-metal edge.\n\nSo, the drums sounds really loud in the mix. To the point in my speakers they make static appear. Maybe it is just the song itself, I don't know. The drums seem overpowered, and raw. When I say raw, I don't mean raw as in Black metal raw (done right). I mean raw as in too unclean for this particular band (bad). Lars' snare doesn't sound that good at all. I mean, he tuned the one in St Anger pretty badly, and this is barely a step up. The bass drum is done properly though. Notice how I said it singular? So he might use two kick-drums, but he could do this album easily with one. I don't recall hearing any double bass runs, and what sucks is that St Anger had double bass runs (infrequent, but at least had them). For this song there is none, though I won't deduct any points because this is only one song off the upcoming album.\n\nJames' vocals are still crap. I mean, he sings way better than half the people out there, just it really feels like he's aged, and is singing a mesh of St Anger + Load. Anyone expecting even remote thrash vocals will be disappointed. In fact, the lyrical content has gone to hell... remember when the lyrics actually held good value? Even St Anger had some, well, decent lyrics... but here it seems very drawn out. I think this album coming out will have some serious lyrical drawbacks, or maybe it is just this one song.\n\nThe guitar kicks ass. Kirk is the only thing shining on the album. The riffs composed for the beginning and middle are quite catchy and very old Metallica, while probably holding the ability to appeal to the newer audiences. I can't say much because he shines here. Until the end that is.\nYes, the problem with this song is the end. They tried to do another \"One\". The ending feels so forced. The solo at the beginning of the 'end passage' starts off really nice, but it just goes on too long. Kirk is climbing to many scales and trying too many hammer on/off's on the pentatonic (I think?) scale. Towards the end you just feel like \"enough is enough\". The anti-climactic ending sucked balls, but it wasn't a total failure. The solo is still an improvement from nothing... though I would fix this song by cutting out the drum roll at the end by Lars. What the FUCK was he thinking. Is it just me or do the drums sound very messy, off time and totally out of place where they are? It seems as if they tried to add in a rifle/roll effect on the snare at the end to make it climax... but it turned me off. Totally cacophonic.\n\nOverall it is okay. There is some thrash nu metal fusion riffs (you'll know them when you hear them, theres a new genre for us!), the solo is great but goes on to long and dwindles into mediocrity, but other than that... its decent. Don't wet your pants over it.\n",
        "\nNow when I heard Metallica was going to be coming out with a new CD, I wasn't very excited, and after listening to their first single I'm still not very excited, but I am intrigued.\n\nThe song starts off slow and the first thought that comes to mind is great, LOAD all over again. And it does indeed sound like that for roughly the first half of the song. If I was Metallica and I was going to put out a new song, I'd wanna' come out swinging. This is suppose to be a thrash band (well 'were' a thrash band), where's the speed? The aggression? Ugh! Well anyway the vocals come in and honestly, bring the song down. James' vocals have been so bad ever since the 90's. The whole clean singing into hard rock style vocals doesn't work for him or the band. Kind of reminds me of The Unforgiven Pt.2 a little bit.\n\nAround the four minute mark the song starts to pick up speed and actually starts to sound good, really good. I even hear some riffs in there that remind me of the old Metallica, like something off Ride The Lightning. After a while James stops singing (thank god) and we're treated to some great guitar work, which we haven't seen from them in a long, long time. The riffs don't sound generic as they did on St.Anger and the solos sound really oldschool. There's one tapping riff that I really like, it's nothing special but it just sounds really good with the song. It's just nice to see them making their music fun again.\n\nAt this point in the review I would get into the lyrics but what's the point really? Just look at the lyrics from any of their last four albums to get the idea of what this song is about. Then again that's not the most important part of the song. What's important is that this song shows hope that the new Metallica album might actually be good! I don't think the old Metallica will ever be back, but they may able to make up for the last pieces of crap they spewed out. If you liked Metallica from the 90's on, then you'll like this entire song. If you're dying to hear Metallica finally play something good, skip the first four minutes ahead to the middle of the song and enjoy, because the only reason they got 50% on this review is for those last four minutes.\n",
        "\nTo begin with, it is obvious that there is a model that Metallica followed in writing this song and that model is called: Fade to black. The verses are melodic and full of emotion, while the choruses come out strong and powerful with the mighty riff driving them... along with Lars\u2019s famous and unique at times, snare work that gets on the listeners\u2019 nerves from the very beginning. After the end of the second chorus the song evolves into a progressive mixture of changing riffs and strong soloing from Hammett. \n\n\nThe first 4:30 minutes include the song's best moments for me. The melodic lines are catchy, James\u2019s voice is solid, the guitar parts are good, so is the bass line. The guitar solo by Kirk towards the end of the song is good overall and probably the best part in the remaining of the song after the fifth minute.\n\n\nNow, I didn't like hearing James screaming in mid section. Some of the riffs that follow are not powerful at all, I must say. Some, we have heard before. The production does not satisfy my taste. I hope it will sound somewhat better in the album. Another thing that needs to be mentioned, is that there is obviously a problem with the flow of all these different guitar parts. Again, like in \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, connecting different sounding guitar parts seems to be a difficult task for Metallica.\n\n\nFinally, the worst part in my opinion is Lars's drumming. I'm afraid it is terrible and it really bugs me that the tempos and fills we are hearing, actually made this song. Excuse me, but what on earth was Rick Rubin thinking? We all know that Lars is not exactly the best drummer out there but hell, Metallica has been in the studio for ages and after all these long years, this is the drum track that to make it on this song? \n\n\nAll in all, I'd say that the song has some good elements and some bad as well. In any case it doesn\u2019t deserve anything more than a 6 out of 10.\n",
        "\nAnd metallica released their single 'The Day That Never Comes' of the upcoming album entitled 'Death Magnetic'. It's not bad actually, nor outstanding anyway. This is a \"safe\" song in my opinion.\n\nIt has a structure quite similar to their well known classic 'One'. Mellow opening and verses, short energetic chorus, a long and rapid instrumental section and fast lead guitar playing, without the infamous 'Wah-Wah' this time. However, it isn't as convincing, groundbreaking or exciting as 'One', simply because this is Metallica of 2008, not 1988.\n\nJames has lost his ability to sing like a lion and here he sounds okay, but still not intense as in the past. Kirk's soloing isn't as mindblowing as it was, he using the same scales anyway, but he doesn't have the same emotion and young spirit he had once, thus don't expect for an intense performance such as One's psycho tapping solo, but he still got his technique right down. The bass and drums are there, nothing special at all, but they carry the song quite well.\n\nThe riffs and ideas in this song are okay, there is nothing we haven't heard before, but the song keeps on a decent level for all of it's seven minutes length. There are some harmonized guitar riffs in the instrumental section of the song which reminds a bit of 'Iron Maiden' style, but there are no rip offs or something.\n\nAnyway, this single is OK. It isn't terrible nor excellent, it's better than their last efforts, but I hope the full album will have more convincing and memorable moments than this decent output.\n",
        "\nWell like many other people on this site, I'm still waiting for Death Magnetic to come around. That day is almost upon us, but it is not quite there yet. However, The Day That Never Comes is upon us. I actually did not know that yesterday was the day that The Day That Never Comes single was to come, but I got to say I am rather happy it did. It provided me a bit of a gut wrenching surprise when I first went to listen to it. Had Metallica simply gone back to the Load formula, or had they really returned to their thrash metal sound? Well, lets find out.\n\nThe answer is neither, at least as of now. Metallica definitely did not repeat the Load or Reload formula, that is for sure. However, I cannot seem to quite judge if Metallica did make the full return to thrash that we all want. What I can say though is that people did expect a bit too much out of just a single. Quite simply after reading many of the reviews here, people are forgetting that The Day That Never Comes is a ballad! Of course a ballad is not going to be insanely heavy or fast for the most part, it's going to be slow and rather moody. Hence the reason to explain things like James's rather weak vocal performance and the generally slow structure. I admittedly did not think his singing was that great, but I realized after a few listens to The Day That Never Comes that for the situation, it does just fine. Sure it could have been better, but at what it did it was just fine. Also the song seems to drag out for a long time without a lot of real \"action\" or \"heavy\", and that made listening to The Day That Never Comes a bit of a drag. \n\nPlus, the lyrics are rather lame. Nothing really thought provoking or particularly interesting. They appear to be about some guy who has been taken advantage of by his friends and now he's just realizing the extent of the damage that has been done to him because he has been taken advantage of so much. While it is well written and I can sort of identify this because it happened to me, I definitely think Metallica could have wrote some much better lyrics then this. They are still, and always were, capable of writing so much better lyrics then the ones for The Day That Never Comes. \n\nHowever, those seem to be the really only bad issues. The first good about The Day That Never comes is the production rocks. No lame sounding snare drum tone or over focus on Lars's drums, the guitar tone sounds pretty thick and rich, and best of all Robert Trujillo, one of my favorite metal bassists ever, has been included and he plays is part absolutely stellar. He is definitely up for the job of being Metallica's bassist. Also, Kirk Hammett is back on the lead guitar! Sure, the long solo is a rather rehashed of many of the same licks he's used in the past, it is still good to hear Kirk Hammett ripping the fretboard of his guitar again with his playing. Plus, no real wah pedal use here, which is something you do not necessarily hear of Kirk much. He even breaks up the solo into two parts, something that he did very commonly on ...And Justice For All and that is was a nice welcome surprise. Lars Ulrich's performance was top notch, filled up with the tight skill and awesomeness that he is so well known for. Overall, except for James Hetfield's vocals, everyone did very well and played the song nicely. \n\nAll in all, The Day That Never Comes is not too bad. It's a ballad and people should realize that, and it's certainly not Metallica's best ballad ever. It does show one thing though that we all wanted Metallica, the biggest true heavy metal band on earth, to do. After over a decade of being devoid of any real metal material, Metallica is finally putting the \"Metal\" back in their name.\n",
        "\nNo, no, no and no! I knew that there would be people that would say \u201cMetallica is Back!!\u201d when this song was released. Just because its metal doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re back. Since some people have been saying that \u201cThey\u2019re Back!\u201d, then it\u2019s safe to think that this song would be fast and would have at least a little thrash in it. But this\u2026.No, they are NOT back! Now I know that they have said that the first and last track of the album will be thrashy, and I surely hope at least those songs are fucking cool. But this? No way! This song just sounds like Load/Reload but with better lyrics and a good guitar solo. Boring, bland, and uninspiring, that\u2019s what I got from this song.\n\nThe song opens almost like \u2018One\u2019, and I\u2019ll admit that I almost saw God at that moment. I started to think,\u201dOh my God, They ARE Back!!\u201d But as soon as James Hetfield started singing, that\u2019s when everything went downhill. The first song that came to mind when he started singing was \u2018Until It Sleeps\u2019 from fucking Load! \u2018Until It Sleeps pt.II\u2019, that could\u2019ve been a fitting title for this song. And the drums, well its Lars. What the hell could you expect from Lars Ulrich, especially at this age? Even at his prime he still wasn\u2019t that good. He was very boring in fact, and this is no different. What I really wanted to hear was Trujillo, but I could barely hear the bass, and when I did it didn\u2019t sound anything special. I always thought Trujillo was pretty good, but this was just ordinary.\n\nThere is only one saving grace in this song, and I think the majority of you know what I\u2019m talking about: Kirk Hammet. That solo at the end of the song was what the whole song should\u2019ve been filled with. Now most people have been saying that he was re-using solo sections and riffs from their older songs, but who cares?! Graveland does that all the time and they still kick fucking ass! As long as it\u2019s not blatantly obvious, then it\u2019s okay to me.\n\nNo, Metallica is not back! No, this song is not the proof of God! And no this song is not even good at all! But it is just one song, so who knows? Maybe the other songs could kick some ass. I mean come on, check out the song titles like \u2018Unforgiven pt.III\u2019 or \u2018All Nightmare Long\u2019. Yea, those song titles sound KILLER dude!\n",
        "\n\"The day that never comes\" has finally arrived. The extraordinarily hyped single off of Metallica's new CD, \"Death Magnetic,\" hit the airwaves August 21st, 2008. It is possible that the number of people who wanted to hear Metallica's \"return to thrash\" was equaled or even surpassed by the number who wanted to see the band burn and miserably fail. There are going to be reviews on both ends of the spectrum, but I will try and be as fair as possible. Simply put, the song was anywhere from \"O.K.\" to \"pretty good,\" and I will try to break down why.\n\nThe vocals are not, and I sincerely doubt ever will be, as good as they were in the 80s. No surprise there. However, they have shown improvement and are never cringe worthy during the song. That's something that couldn't be said about St. Anger.\n\nThe drums are as dull as ever. Lars is a limited drummer and shows no signs of improving... ever. Luckily, he can keep a beat, at least in the studio, and I don't believe anyone realistically believed that there was going to be a drumming makeover, other than not having a trash can for a snare.\n\nThe solo is actually pretty good. For one, it exists. That's an improvement. Secondly, there isn't a wah wah pedal. Thirdly, it is a thrashy solo, and has little of the hard rock elements that have become common with Metallica. There are some down sides to the solo as well. They tried a little to hard to sound like their 80s self. The solo wasn't very original and sounds a repeat of anything off of AJFA or MOP. Also, it doesn't build nearly as much as it could have, and leaves the song almost incomplete. It makes it seem as though there should be more even though the song is already 8 minutes.\n\nThe first half was somewhat boring. The riffs weren't attention grabbing, and it just seems like it is trying to waste time to make the song qualify as epic. Unfortunately, epic length does not equal an epic song.\n\nThe second half was pretty enjoyable. There were some interesting changes and riffs that were interesting. The solo should have capitalized on them a bit more I believe, but that did not detract to much. The song should've either ended earlier, or added something at the end. The sudden stop wasn't sudden enough.\n\nThe production was good. The guitars sounded great, and were distinct. The drums didn't sound like muddled banging. I wish the bass was up louder, but I'm a bass player and I believe that I might be a little biased. The vocals may have been a bit too loud. If I were producing the album, Hetfield's voice is the last thing I'd want to emphasize.\n\nThe lyrics were decent. There's not much else to say about them. They didn't grab me, nor did they disgust me.\n\nOverall, the song was decent. There was nothing particularly memorable about it. For Metallica, however, a song written in 2008 that doesn't damn them is a success. I would say wait for the CD to come out before you reach your final verdict on Metallica. This song is a small step in the right direction.\n",
        "\nAugust 21st. The day Metallica\u2019s first single from their upcoming new album was released. Metallica took an immense gamble by creating the amount of hype they did while making this album. Being an avid Metallica fan I too was easily pulled into this vortex of the hype created by the band. Eventually though I thought by creating the hype that Metallica had indeed made a mistake because by doing that they had raised the expectations of the fans tenfold and if they made a weak album they would be buried under the disappointment of the fans. After a weak last album I pretty much thought that by bearing the two-edged sword called hype they indeed had the sharper side pointing towards themselves.\n\nFinally, the test to all what they had done in the last year and a half had come down to this. This single by the name of \u201cThe Day That Never Comes\u201d which was released just a few minutes back and I hear it once again for the third time as I write this review. Excitement as well as the fear of disappointment consumed me as I put on this track, which by the way can be heard at their official site.\n\nThe track begins with a slow ballad like intro with the drums soon coming in shortly after. The track structure wise is almost like their extremely famous track \u201cOne\u201d. It starts off slowly with heavy parts in between and the whole band going all out nuts near the end. This band has definitely returned to its old days as it includes riffs sounding similar to \u201cOrion\u201d as well as the ever famous machine gun riffs of \u201cOne\u201d. The last 3 minutes of this track starting from the machine gun riffs I just mentioned are nothing less that pure bliss. A complex song structure, fast paced riffs and bass lines and a plethora of clean solos near the end put an end to the speculation that \u201cold Metallica\u201d are dead. They sure as hell aren\u2019t.\n\nYes, James isn't in his twenties anymore and doesn't sound as good as he did earlier but Rob Trujillio and Kirk complete him by doing great jobs at the bass and electric guitars respectively. Kirk has proved his critics wrong by creating a solo which has come right out of the top drawer and sounds like something that would be there on \"... And Justice For All.\"\n\nExtremely heavy, extremely orgasmic and extremely satisfying is what as a Metallica fan is all I can say. If there are more tracks like these on the upcoming album then this will be ranked right up there with one of the band\u2019s best album.\n",
        "\nHaving recently heard the song on the radio not 10 minutes has left me with a bit of a conundrum as to what to make of this song. The hype surrounding this album seems to put any impartiality out the window in favor of giddy fanboyism. I for one have hoped to shy away from such things. Indications have left to many question marks in my mind: song titles like Unforgiven III, Kirk's refusal to relearn how to solo without his wah pedal, and the recent release of \"Cyanide,\" which to put it bluntly, drags on for 2-3 minutes more than it should and sounds like an attempt to create a Load or Black Album era song with the writing and arrangements of the songs from And Justice for All. \n\nThat said, this album serves almost as a good overview of their entire career and seems to take the best from their last 25 years and weed out most of the worst. Production values from the Black Album with arrangement styles reminiscent of the glory days seems like a wet dream for anyone who hated \"One's\" production and lack of bass, or those who loved \"Enter Sandman's\" heaviyness but found it too commercial and the equivalent of heavy metal karaoke for the guitar. Oh and one other thing, KIRK HAMMET ISN'T USING HIS WAH PEDAL ON THE GUITAR SOLO! For a guitar nerd like me its Christmas. The riffs on this song are heavy, fast and keep coming without being repetitive. \n\nSo what does this mean? Has Metallica returned? In short, the answer is still no. There's still some things preventing this from being perfect. Those hoping James would improve his vocal delivery will be disappointed; the delivery he's been doing since the Black Album through St. Anger is still there in full here (at least its in tune and the lyrics are less crappy). Cyanide showed Metallica still hasn't weened out the last of their commercial hooks and this song is no exception. And although its without wah on the solo, Kirk blatantly plagerises himself and basically uses the same licks he used on One and Master of Puppets in a different order. And although he's not using it as much on THIS song, previews and their live performances of new songs still show we'll all have to sit through his attempts to be the heavy metal Jimi Hendrix. This song and probably this next album are probably on the fast track to being over hyped and overrated. Continue to be skeptical. Be wary of reviews claiming this album to be in competition with Master of Puppets as the best Metallica album or this song to be the next \"One\" because they aren't. The song needs to be viewed in the light of the past 20 years of their work. One can't forget the last 3 albums and call this a return. But speaking for myself, I really don't care; It sure is good to hear Metallica put out good heavy music. And although they don't quite deserve calls of \"The return of the Metal Gods,\" they still deserve a hearty \"Welcome Back.\"\n",
        "\nAfter the controversy caused by the release of \u201cLoad\u201d, a very strong album that showed the new direction Metallica went through, \u201cReload\u201d was released, an album mostly filled with the tracks that didn't make it onto \u201cLoad\u201d. At least some songs of this album were written before the release of \u201cLoad\u201d, I'm pretty sure of it since \u201cDevil's Dance\u201d was performed twice during 1995, together with \u201c2x4\u201d.\n\nAs for the music, this is not a metal album, like most of you know, but it is not \u201cLoad II\u201d either; while \u201cLoad\u201d was a pretty bluesy album, with lots of melancholic songs and such (\u201cBleeding Me\u201d, \u201cOutlaw Torn\u201d, \u201cUntil it Sleeps\u201d, \u201cMama Said\u201d, etc.), \u201cReload\u201d shows the band adopting a hard rock sound, some songs even reminding me of some classic rock bands out there. The tunes are generally heavy and fairly aggressive at times, an example being the opener or \u201cAttitude\u201d. All the tracks are also relatively long, thanks to some extended solo sections and intrumental parts, which is a thing that I truly appreciate. While the songs are not progressive 'monsters', so to speak, a la \u201c...And Justice for All\u201d (which is, by the way, the best Metallica record ever), their structures are quite interesting at times, two examples being the false ending of \u201cBetter than You\u201d and the bridge of \u201cFixxxer\u201d.\n\nSpeaking about \u201cFixxxer\u201d, this is a song that disappointed me a bit. It is not a bad song, by any means, no \u2013 but it still can't reach the greatness of the amazing \u201cOutlaw Torn\u201d. I don't know, but when I saw that \u201cFixxxer\u201d was the longest song of \u201cReload\u201d and also the closer, I really thought it would be a diamond like \u201cOutlaw Torn\u201d. Unfortunately, I was wrong, but it still is a pretty good song, containing some catchy riffs and one of the best solos of the album.\n\nReturning to the comparison between \u201cLoad\u201d and \u201cReload\u201d, James' vocal approach here is pretty aggressive and his voice sounds pretty damn raw at times. With \u201cLoad\u201d he adopted a more melodic approach, but he's absolutely different here, try to listen to \u201cBetter than You\u201d and \u201cWasting My Hate\u201d and you'll see. As for the production, it is pretty good (obviously, this is Metallica) and clear, the guitar assuming the main role, the bass being audible during most of the time and the drums always there.\n\nKirk's performance here is pretty competent, but I still think that this new sound Metallica adopted didn't benefit him at all; he is a metal guitar player, no doubts about it, he can't just pull out those melodic, emotional solos that frequently, and that doesn't benefit the album. On \u201cAJFA\u201d, for example, he made songs like \u201cShortest Straw\u201d what they were, with his tight lead playing, but, this time, he has not enought space to shine and some solos of this album are clearly underdeveloped and even weak. As for Lars, he still is extremely predictable; the new sound Metallica adopted doesn't benefit him that much either; he clearly overuses the \u201ckick-snare-kick-snare\u201d pattern and his fills are weak during most of the times. His performance is average, all in all.\n\nAs for the songs, I clearly disagree with the majority of the reviewers who said that the first three tunes of the album are the highlights; hell no, \u201cFuel\u201d, \u201cThe Memory Remains\u201d and \u201cDevil's Dance\u201d bore me, perhaps because I've already heard them too many fucking times. The best of the three probably is \u201cFuel\u201d though: it clearly is the fastest and the most 'metal' tune of the bunch. \u201cDevil's Dance\u201d is very groovy, albeit repetitive, and \u201cThe Memory Remains\u201d sounds great live, but the studio version doesn't hold my attention.\n\n\u201cUnforgiven II\u201d is a competent ballad, nothing special, but it is when we reach \u201cBetter than You\u201d that the album really gets going: this song is pretty damn good, in my opinion, great chorus and I love the false ending. The vocals on this track are also very very aggressive, great stuff. \u201cSlither\u201d follows and it is also pretty midpaced, with nice riffs. \u201cCarpe Diem Baby\u201d is a clear highlight, being the seventh track and sounding like a more elaborated version of the previous two songs. \u201cBad Seed\u201d is a bit faster, even containing some double-bass parts, \u201cPrince Charming\u201d wins the prize for the song with the best riffs of this album, and finally \u201cFixxxer\u201d closes the album perfectly.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some more fillers hidden here, \u201cLow Man's Lyric\u201d being one of them. It is a very very repetitive tune, and the fact that it contains some violin lines doesn't help. \u201cAttitude\u201d is a really bad song, probably the only BAD tune of the record, and \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are\u201d is a bit better but far from a good song, despite its relatively intricate and complex structure.\n\nSo, at the end of the day a solid hard rock album, being quite good at times. If you enjoyed \u201cLoad\u201d (or if you like hard rock) you'll like this album that's for sure. Highlights: \u201cFixxxer\u201d and \u201cPrince Charming\u201d.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the beginning of \u201cFuel\u201d.\n- the \u201cto fall in love with life again\u201d part of \u201cFixxxer\u201d.\n",
        "\nIf we\u2019re all totally honest, on a purely musical level \u2018Master Of Puppets\u2019 is a decidedly unremarkable and unexceptional piece of work. \nMany a band before and since have surpassed it on all manner of counts. They\u2019ve surpassed it in the technicality, speed and force of the riffs, and achieved far superior production values and sound quality. They\u2019ve learnt the benefit of being concise and brief rather than long-winded, developed similar lyrical themes in a more mature fashion, and of course, outdone the record for drumming proficiency \u2013 which, if we are again frank, is not that much of an accomplishment by any standards.\nOn such a level, Metallica\u2019s third record has no business being treated as the landmark it is so often celebrated as. So why IS it celebrated as such?\n\nWell, perhaps it is because \u2018Master Of Puppets\u2019 offers what so few records in the wide world of music can offer. To wit; absolute transcendence.\n\nIn the most concrete terms, Metallica achieved with \u2018Master Of Puppets\u2019 an expansion upon the sound showcased on \u2018Ride The Lightning\u2019, a sound rather clumsily overstretched with \u2018...And Justice For All.\u2019 Each song averages between 5 and 8 minutes, with the band\u2019s patented buzz-saw thrashing takes on a significantly more expansive turn, with a hundred times more thought given to song-writing and its effect rather than relentless speed. \nTo say that it is a far more emotionally charging record is to undersell it \u2013 the work here is anthemic to an astounding degree, and this feat is made all the more impressive by the fact that for all the brazen, soaring and wonderfully handled melodicism, the band\u2019s more violent tendencies are never lost amongst the slew of newer ideas.\nThe epic song structures meld with gritty thrashing aggression fantastically cohesively, with the band bashing the living hell out of their instruments to capture a sound that is stunningly forthright as well as considered and introspective. The level of musical balance exhibited here between these two aspects is the band\u2019s true triumph \u2013 they valiantly negotiate between the pitfall of simply putting their heads down and thrashing out for the hell of it, and the pitfall of flogging their more high-minded ideas to death.\n\nFor those who care for albums that simply provide a rocking good time, \u2018Master Of Puppets\u2019 hardly disappoints on that front either. The likes of \u2018Damage Inc.\u2019 and the infamous title track bulldoze their way through the dry, Flemming Rasmussen-supplied production in a barrage of shredding, maniacal riffs, whilst \u2018Leper Messiah\u2019 brings things down a stomping march. \nThe oft-derided \u2018Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\u2019 displays a phenomenal grasp of dynamics by segueing seamlessly from a raw and pensive \u2018power ballad\u2019 into a furious thrasher of a track \u2013 though it \u2018Disposable Heroes\u2019 that amazes the most, being undoubtedly the single most aggressive and downright vicious track Metallica may have ever put their name to, not to mention their most savagely coherent attack upon the supposed expendability of fallen war heroes.\n\nIn their own way, Metallica seemed to have unlocked a sublime combination of many of the elements that make heavy metal such an extraordinary and enduring genre, and this lent the music herein an unforgettably potent quality, elevating it above and beyond the status of \u2018excellent\u2019 to sheer bloody mind-blowing. Few albums have achieved this classic status \u2013 Black Sabbath\u2019s eponymous debut, Dio\u2019s \u2018Holy Diver\u2019, Iron Maiden\u2019s \u2018Number Of The Beast\u2019, Judas Priest\u2019s \u2018Painkiller\u2019 amongst them \u2013 and as such, \u2018Master Of Puppets\u2019 is in good company.\n\nListening to this album for the first time, and every single time after that, feels like partaking in some kind of communal occasion of the most emotionally gratifying and uplifting sort. It is a sound where, for once, all the minutiae flaws attached to its creators are pushed entirely out of the consciousness and a special kind of magic takes hold over the listener.\nAnd for that remarkable achievement, \u2018Master Of Puppets\u2019 is fully deserving of its iconic status as a TRUE METAL CLASSIC.\n",
        "\n\"What's this? Oh, it's just another MoP review. Giving it a low score no less. My my, do people still have time to write this? Surely they have better things to do than criticize an album with 21 reviews (at time of starting)!\" You might say. I seriously can't blame you if you don't want to read this, I'm sure you can read UltraBoris's review again or maybe Napero's. After all why care about another review? Those two reviews sum the album up pretty nicely don't you think?\n\nTruth is, I'm not even sure why I'm doing this. Maybe it's that last review (NecroFile\u2019s was the last one when I started this,) that got me knickers in a twist. Maybe it's just time for me to say what I have to say about Master of Puppets. Maybe I'm bored and I'm writing this at 10 o'clock just for the hell of it. Point is, I don't really care why I'm writing this and neither should you. All that matters is that I'm giving an honest opinion on this album and it's your prerogative to read it, or not as the case may be.\n\nWhen people first got into metal, or are trying to get into metal, they will always hear of Metallica. Be it from friends, the media, or family (in some rare cases,) people will most certainly recommend you this band and will most likely recommend this as essential listening or the only album everyone should own from them.\n\nNow let me tell you my story for a moment. I am fairly new to metal; I have only been a fan for about two years as per the date of this review. I used to believe that the mainstream metal media was absolute gospel for the first two months of my tenure as a metalhead and I used to immerse myself in whatever the media recommended me. A key turning point in my life was when I bought an issue of Guitar World. That issue had the \"Top 100 Guitar Albums,\" which was very intriguing to a young guitarist such as myself. While reading that issue, I read about Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All. I read them very carefully to decide which would be my major gateway to true metaldom (I had, by that point, bought Cowboys from Hell by Pantera but that didn't make me a true fan.) So after poring over the entries again and again, I decided to just go to the record store and listen to the albums to hear which one was better. Once there, I asked the guy to put on ...And Justice For All and I was blown away. I then asked him to put on this album, mere seconds into the album I was turned off by the acoustic intro. I basically said that \"This is not what I expected from a band like Metallica! I mean where's the metal?\" and got ...And Justice For All.\n\nThere you have it, a young metalhead who decided to not listen to all the hype and just tried to listen to those albums objectively. If it was the greatest metal album of all time, surely I would be worshiping it, wouldn't I? If it was the be-all, end-all of thrash (as some misguidedly claim it to be,) would I not buy it? So what made me so repulsed by it, that I had put off buying for about a year? Sure, this album is not horrible in the most absolute sense of the word but neither is it the culmination of about 16 years (counting from Black Sabbath's debut, of course,) of metal progression. This album is, at best, average and at worst is horrible. For one, this album is merely a much worse retread of Ride the Lightning; lacking the riffs and a rather worse production.\n\nI'll try and breakdown this album.\n\nLet's take a look at the most obvious element: the songs. For a thrash album, Master of Puppets has a disturbing lack of thrash. From the eight songs present, I can only consider three of them to be thrash (and if I'm being really picky, only two and a half.) Let me say that again: only three out of eight songs are what I consider to be thrash. That's awful for an album that is often considered to be the greatest thrash album. Those three songs are the opener \"Battery,\" the title track and the closer \"Damage Inc.\" Of those three, two of them are dangerously flawed: the title is overly long and contains a useless melodic interlude; and \"Damage Inc.\" has a pointlessly long intro in what would otherwise be a great song.\n\nLet's start with the good. \"Battery\" is an effective opener and it's a great thrasher. When I first listened to it I was turned off by the acoustic intro, in retrospect I should have listened longer and then I would buy this album and write a completely different review. Regardless, the acoustic intro ended up as a perfect build to one of the albums best songs. \"Battery\" has all the elements of a great thrasher. It has the riffs and the solos. The riffs in this song are somewhat catchy, but they still have the thrash bite to them that make them headbangable. In particular, I like the riff after the second solo. That one was pretty much the climax of the entire song; I'm disappointed that Metallica did not make more riffs like that one. The solos are also quite good. Let's face it; Kirk Hammet is not what many people claim him to be. He is not a guitar god or even an adequate replacement for Mustaine. But in this song he actually manages to outdo himself in the soloing department. Sure, he can only solo using the pentatonic scale and related scales and modes but his playing is actually rather good.\n\n\"Master of Puppets\" has the potential to be a great song, instead Metallica chose to drag it on way too long and add a pointless melodic interlude. The good parts of this song make it tolerable, though, so it's worth a listen. The opening riff is probably the most recognizable riff in metal, for better or worse. It's not bad but I don't see what's so great about it. It doesn't make me bang my head as forcefully as the verse riff of \"Fight Fire with Fire\" or the riffs of the other two good songs on this album it lacks a certain 'power' to it that Metallica had used previously. After a few times the problem immediately comes to the fore, it's too long. They repeated the opening riff too many times and then followed it with a less than capable verse riff. Why is it less than capable? One, it seems rather forced and Two, is not as fast as the previous riffs. The chorus riff is quite nice but then the song completely loses coherency after the second chorus. Now I don't know what happened in the recording studio or in the writing process, but somehow Metallica decided that it was a good thing to just stop the thrashiness altogether and then play some melodic thing. Melody is not the problem, there are many thrash bands that are melodic like Anthrax or Flotsam and Jetsam. It's the fact that they just stop being thrashy in order to be melodic. Then comes that irritating solo where Hetfield shows his stuff by playing something my neophyte guitarist cousin could play with little effort. After that comes the crowdchant-worthy \"MASTER! MASTER!\" part. It gets kind of grating after the first few listens, you can't imagine how annoying it is when your friends put this part on repeat (well, maybe you can.) I'm pretty sure I have some sort of facial tic whenever I hear this part. Well, it's not THAT bad but sure as hell tries to be. The riff under it is completely forgettable but the following solo is quite good and then they follow it with another verse and chorus. After that last chorus Metallica again made the song drag on too long by extending the already half-assed riff to something even less effective. Now I have no problem with long thrashers, Heathen, Flotsam and Jetsam, and Dark Angel (specifically TDNH) are all regulars on my playlist. But long thrashers are not long simply on a whim, they must have a logical reason why they are long. \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d does not have enough variety or have compelling enough riffs to make it interesting enough for me. Honestly, the song would be better off without the melodic interlude, the long intro and that outro.\n\nThe last good song is incidentally the last song on the album. \u201cDamage Inc.\u201d may just be the best song on this album. The riffs in this one are some of the finest pre \u2026And Justice For All Metallica riffs. Listen to the pre-verse riff; that one is just vicious, it almost makes it worthwhile waiting for that damned intro to finish, almost but not nearly enough. Thankfully the following riff (and the rest of the song,) is just\u2026well pure, unadulterated thrash riffage. The bridge riff is even more thrash than the last, if I were to pick one moment that the album can actually stake a claim at being the best thrash album ever, it would be this riff. However one riff alone does not make for a fantastic thrash album, it requires consistently great riff after riff and as I have outlined before, there are only few great riffs in this album. The solo in this song may just be Kirk\u2019s most inspired, if his solos were this good all the time, then he might just be the guitar god everyone thinks he is. I mean seriously, listen to it again. The technique may not be as flashy as Lee Altus or Mustaine, but this kid\u2019s got heart when he plays this solo and it really is disappointing that he could only shine at two instances in this album. By the end of the song you just feel that something\u2019s lacking. It could have been a so much better song but Metallica refused to let it be amazing. In order to experience the full potential of this song, I urge you to check Dream Theater\u2019s version with Barney of Napalm Death. Go on, I\u2019m still going to be here. You\u2019re back? Good. What you just saw was what \u201cDamage Inc.\u201d should have been. The drums were made better with Portnoy\u2019s double bass, the riffs were given an extra layer of badass and the solo was definitely improved by Petrucci\u2019s mastery of his instrument, not to mention Barney\u2019s vox which are much, much, much better than Hetfield\u2019s monotone delivery. In the end, the version on this album is not bad, great even.\n\nSo what does this mean for the bad songs then? They all suffer from being plodding, boring and general lack of focus. The most obvious criticism I can give Metallica is the fact that this album has slow parts for the sake of having slow parts. Metallica does not write the slow and/or melodic parts to be an extension of what has been written before, the slow parts just come. No reason, no explanation, they just suddenly take over the thrash.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be,\u201d an apparent tribute to bassist Cliff Burton\u2019s Lovecraftian fandom. The listener will notice that this song is slow and it\u2019s not as in \u2018slow thrash\u2019 where the music goes along at least at 100 bpm. No, the slow I\u2019m talking about is \u2018Sabbath slow.\u2019 Now I don\u2019t know where they get the idea but \u2018Sabbath slow\u2019 is not the direction that thrash went, had gone, or should go. I find the whole idea to be appalling and contradict with the very essence of thrash. Thrash, as a genre, will bring to mind such phrases as \u201cfast,\u201d \u201cbreakneck pace,\u201d \u201cspeed,\u201d etc. When I think of thrash I certainly don\u2019t think of \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be.\u201d The riffs by itself are alright but again, not thrash. No wonder thrash slipped into a coma in the mid-90s, people got the idea that it\u2019s perfectly fine to go along at half-speed and still be called thrash. \u201cHey, Metallica\u2019s \u201986 album was filled with slow songs and that\u2019s called thrash! Why don\u2019t we do the same thing?\u201d I\u2019m sure many proto-groove bands were thinking along these lines. Now let\u2019s go back to the song again. To be quite honest I felt that this song could\u2019ve been better if it only went half as long, a third even. I guess it\u2019s just plodding and Kirk\u2019s little Egyptian solo was barely interesting enough to keep me awake. Also, the lyrics in this song show only a shallow understanding of the Lovecraftian mythos. I don\u2019t usually rag on lyrics too much because most of the time metal lyrics are awful. This one needs pointing out because Burton said that he was a big fan of Lovecraft yet the lyrics look like something that even non-readers of Lovecraft would know. I suppose a whole song filled with themes, creatures and the occult paraphernalia of the mythos wouldn\u2019t go well with the band\u2019s image, but this makes me wonder why they even wrote the song in the first place.\n\n\u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d follows suit and it just gets worse. They try to make this one ballad-y and all that claptrap. Honestly I don\u2019t remember that much about this song, I\u2019m certain that I had a less-than-pleased face when I was listening to it though. The softer parts are half-decent (Judas Priest would later rip it off as \u201cCathedral Spires,\u201d) but I just think that guitars are underused and drums just meander in the background while Cliffy does nothing. Hetfield\u2019s gruff/croaks are grating at best, he should be anywhere near a ballad let alone write one. The overall impression I get from the riffs, drums, vox and the odd solo there is just blah. Not necessarily the worst thing on the album, but not at all thrash metal. Thumbs down.\n\n\u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d suffers from toofuckinglong-itis, the main riff is alright but Heathen does it way better. The chorus gets special mention fro being annoying as hell. \u201cYou will do!/What I say!/ When I tell you to go/ BACK TO THE FRONT!\u201d Why it goes on for 8 (EIGHT!!) excruciating minutes is beyond me. Nothing notable goes on; the solo didn\u2019t do much for me either. NEXT!!\n\n\u201cLeper Messiah\u201d well well, this is semi-passable. Could\u2019ve been a highlight but they had to do the awful and rather plodding intro and outro. The best part of the song is the middle and the okay-ish solo from Kirk. The main riff is rather dull, the vox is okay and drums are sub-standard, business as usual for Metallica.\n\nAnd now we have come to the most agonizing part of the album. It is the so-called \u2018visionary instrumental\u2019 \u201cOrion.\u201d Why Lord? WHY!? This is just about the worst thing they did because it DIRECTLY led to their future aural excrement. St. Anger was nothing compared to this! Sure the song lengths are about the same and \u201cOrion\u201d has slightly better production (very slightly,) but Drop C tuning is a blessing compared to this arrant nonsense. \u201cWhy is \u2018Orion\u2019 worse?\u201d You ask? For one, it is nothing but a collection of malformed riffs that don\u2019t even fit together very well. Second, the solos don\u2019t fit the context at all, especially Cliff\u2019s little exercise in ego-feeding. Third, there should be no logical reason why this track (I refuse to call this a song,) drags on for so long. No reason at all. Hell it even fades out at the end! The intro is remarkably overlong, they were confused about what \u2018epic\u2019 entails and song length is not a criteria. Towards the end it slightly picks up from the mediocrity but Christ on the Cross!\n\nOnwards to the second part of the review, the production. While it is pretty standard thrash production, Cliffy gets seriously neutered here. I rarely hear the bass and I\u2019m listening to this on a CD player with Sennheiser headphones! The drums lack power for the most part, even AJFA with its notoriously clicky bass drums have more power than this! The guitar tone is pretty consistent with Metallica\u2019s past efforts and I enjoyed \u201cNo Life \u2018Til Leather\u201d and \u201cRide the Lightning.\u201d The vocals are mixed fairly silently but I suppose it\u2019s just because Metallica didn\u2019t eve bother to re-master this thing after twenty years. I actually think the production is better than certain songs on this album.\n\nThe last part of my review is in defense of it. Yes I am willing to defend MoP, not as a fantastic album or even a thrash album, rather for being a metal album. At the end of the day, this album can still be called an average metal album with occasional thrash elements. This just has too much fluff to be thrash, too mellow and too artificially lengthened. If I looked at it as a heavy metal album only then this would have gotten a higher score (60-65%,) but I chose to look at it as a thrash album because that\u2019s what many people claim it to be thus, the low score. Point is, I don\u2019t think that this is the worst album of all time; I still listen to the worthwhile tracks every few months and while the horrible parts are horrible, they are only overwhelmingly so when you look at it as a thrash album.\n\nWell, that\u2019s all I have to say. If you\u2019ll excuse me I\u2019ll go and look for my copy of \u2026And Justice For All and listen to the only album Metallica has worthy of 90 or higher.\n",
        "\nWhen I first got this album I valued it for its bluesy feel. If I wanted to just relax and listen to something cool and laid back, this was it. However, after two years of sitting in my iTunes library, I realized I wasn\u2019t listening to it. I never listen to it anymore. I guess after the first few listens I just lost interest completely. The fact is, it\u2019s really boring, not just for a Metallica album, but for blues-influenced rock in general.\n\nAin\u2019t My Bitch rocks a little, but I personally prefer 2x4. Even with the cheesy vocal effects and the rather drab solo work, 2x4 is the second best song off the first half of the album. Only Bleeding Me is better, and then only because the instrumental work is beyond what the rest of this album shows. Until It Sleeps was not one of the songs I valued for its bluesy feel. I found this song to be a slightly more lively, but less metal, remake of Nothing Else Matters, another dreadfully boring song. Hero of the Day was similar. The rest of the first half was bland attempts at sounding like metal with a blues tinge.\n\nThe second half was even worse because that\u2019s where they introduced another influence, this time far worse than simple blues. Country has no place in metal, I don\u2019t care what anyone says. Even when I listened to this album for its blues feel, I skipped the country-style tracks. All I can say about the second half is that I enjoy the drawn out downer Outlaw Torn, again, for its bluesy feel. And, for whatever reason, I don\u2019t know, the lyrics to Cure appeal to me. The rest, though I thought it had merit at one time, does not actually have merit.\n\nThe mistake that is most commonly made with regard to this album is to listen to it and expect metal. It is not metal, it is rock. I think the band even admitted this when they put it out. Whatever. I listened to it and knew it was rock. But after the initial enjoyment of blues rock wore off I forgot this album even existed. Going back to it while perusing my iTunes library, I realized why. It may be rock but it is boring rock. Even true blues has a soul, but this has nothing. A few good licks and lyrics, but these are spread far too thin to redeem the album as a whole. As such I now only have the four songs left.\n\nSome may enjoy the blues rock on this album even after the first impression wears off, but I didn\u2019t. Eventually the sheer drabness of the songs made them totally forgettable. The blues should have meaning, a soul, a heart, an atmosphere of loss or longing bordering on depression that is characterized not by pining away but by the fact that one\u2019s life situation is not what one wishes it were, but that one can overcome the harsh times and still live life. The blues is about showing that you have been through Hell, and showing that you can get over it because you\u2019re strong, not about whining because you\u2019re too weak to deal with that Hell. It is in this sense that blues can have a place in metal, but that is not what Metallica gives us here.\n\nI have since discovered ZZ Top, a far superior blues rock band. Their single song Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers rocks ten times as much as this entire album. And if you really want to hear blues with a heavy edge, pick up their album Eliminator, because that one has a soul, that one has vitality. It even has a touch of humor with the song TV Dinners.\n\nIn sum, this is not where to look for metal, and yet it is also not where to look for blues rock. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is, then, except a waste of compact disc materials.\n",
        "\nThis song absolutely marks the new commercial direction Metallica headed for with the release of the self-titled. All the girls in my school love this song, so that's a clue of how easy-listening this song is.\n\nAnyways, I don't label songs as \u201cbad\u201d just because they are commercial. There are commercial, radio-friendly songs out there that are absolutely worth listening in my opinion, tunes like Priest's \u201cRevolution\u201d, Maiden's \u201cWasted Years\u201d, Scorpions' \u201cBlackout\u201d, etc. Metallica are also a band that knows how to write good ballads, classics like \u201cFade to Black\u201d, \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d, \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d and the essential \u201cOne\u201d are some of my personal favourite tunes ever. So, Metallica had everything to really make \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d a better song than it is.\n\nThe problem is that this track is absolutely generic. The guitar lines try to be melancholic and sad, but they are pretty simple and common; the drum beats are pretty lame (Lars, you can do better than that!), the only things that save this tune to be a complete waste of time are Hetfield's vocals, his powerful voice is wonderful here, and the guitar solo, which is short but very emotional. A pretty good solo indeed.\n\nAs for the live tracks, they are useless unless you have never heard Metallica live. Otherwise, the tracks aren't worth listening. The demo of \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d is also useless, in my opinion.\n\nSo, better get other Metallica ballads instead of this one. Compared to \u201cUnforgiven\u201d or \"Bleeding Me\" this song is just a little piece of mediocrity.\n",
        "\nI remember the day St.Anger came out; instead of studying for an exam that was on the next day I caught the bus to the nearest record store and upon finding out that buying the cd would leave me with no money to catch the bus back I bought the cd and walked the 12 or so kilometres back to my house while the wind howled and the rain poured (it was winter down here.) I put it on and I freakin\u2019 loved it.\n\nAnd, in a sense, I still like it. Despite listening to it now and being surprised at just how many mediocre/bad/horrible moments there are crammed into this album I just can\u2019t bring myself to really, genuinely dislike anything that my man Hetfield has put out. Unfortunately, the (obvious) reality has been sinking in pretty hard of late; I guess I\u2019m just going to have to face up to facts and admit that this release just isn\u2019t very good. At all.\n\nWell, I still maintain that this record has some pretty good, maybe even excellent moments; occasional glimpses where the unhinged fury we were promised is actually delivered in a listenable, even enjoyable format. Like glittering diamonds in a lake of poo, the beauty of these moments is accentuated by just how rarely they come up. When Frantic\u2019s otherwise awful TICK TICK TOCK-isms are stripped back for a bit in the bridge, a fairly good riff is finally allowed to blossom for a few seconds and it\u2019s a beautiful thing to behold. Purify\u2019s bridge is absolutely furious; it\u2019s not the best song otherwise (in fact it\u2019s pretty horrible) but in terms of straight forward heaviness it\u2019s one of the heaviest songs Metallica have done, just dripping with aggression; although it takes a bit of skipping to get to the better parts. Likewise, skipping past the first 6 or so minutes of the aimless, almost nu-metallish Some Kind of Monster reveals a rather heavy, slow beast of a riff that unfortunately only pops up for about a minute or so. Five or so tracks later, Sweet Amber is probably the only song here that manages to stay good throughout it\u2019s duration; it\u2019s relatively short and catchy and has a sort of carefree vibe; certainly not a word that I would use to describe most of Metallica\u2019s studio recordings. It\u2018s an enjoyable, galloping, vaguely thrashy and quite rocky song that given better production would probably be up there with Metallica\u2018s better 90\u2018s moments.\n\nAt the same time, these little moments don\u2018t mean much; for every moment that I can safely say \u201cMetallica did it right here\u201d there\u2019s a huge amount of other moments where you\u2019d be perfectly in your rights to go \u201cThis part blows\u201d. All of the title track, for one; it's poor semi heavy riffing mixed in with extremely awkward, ill fitting cleaner/melodic parts. Shoot Me Again has many cringe inducing nu-metallish parts and annoyingly cliched, simplistic riffing (although \u2018All the Shots I take/I spit back at you\u2019 is a cool lyric). Dirty Window, for one, is a perfect argument that this album has some serious, serious flaws. The horrible song name, the horrible DUNDUNDUNDUNDUN DUN DUN DUN POOOONG intro riff/main riff, the lyrics, the unimaginative I-III-IV chord progression (this progression dominates almost every song, but here it\u2019s particularly annoying) - basically all elements of it are truly awful. It is the only Metallica song that I can genuinely say I hate; one has to wonder why no one near the band (or in the band) mentioned something along the lines of \u201cHey guys, this song is no good\u201d.\n\nThe trouble is compounded when you realise that these moments of crappiness just keep on stacking up, they\u2019re in (almost) every single song and they occur with a lot of regularity. The lyrics are always dire and while I\u2019m normally a huge fan of Hetfield\u2019s voice I really can\u2019t say his barking old man persona in this album is good- and let\u2019s not go near his off key bit in Invisible Kid, either. The guitar riffs are mind numbing death by pentatonic stuff; slow and childish, in a sense, they take no effort to play and even less to write, and they repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat. I have no trouble with repetition whatsoever, but only if the riffs are worth repeating, and most of the riffs here aren\u2019t even worth recording. Everywhere you look there's just a heap of aimless, sloppy sort of groovy riffing that brings to mind, well, old men trying to write a thrash record, and it leaves an extremely sour taste in one\u2019s mouth.\n\nThe sour taste lasts for a long time after the album has stopped playing. This album certainly raises some troubling questions. I appreciate that Metallica were having a rough time when they were recording this- but does that mean that they had to throw all aspects of quality control out the window? Had they surrounded themselves with sycophants and yes-men to such an extent that no one was willing to suggest an alternative approach? Why didn\u2019t they at least make the songs quicker- shorter and sharper if you will, which would enable them to make things heavier/faster, more cathartic (and perhaps most importantly) more listenable? What was Bob Rock, who has for much of his career spent his time capturing amazing rock guitar/drum tones, thinking when he recorded this? Is Lars really so lazy that he won\u2019t spend five minutes a day tuning his snare drum up? Why didn\u2019t Hetfield tell his bandmates \u201cY\u2019know, I think I\u2019ll write all the lyrics for these songs, as you guys suck at them\u201d? Why didn\u2019t Kirk at least write some other guitar bits? And perhaps most importantly, will Metallica ever recover the magic of the mid 80\u2019s, or even their solid mid-90\u2019s form? Do Metallica still have the motivation, the fire, to write good music?\n\nWe can only hope that said questions get positive answers on the next Metallica album. It\u2019s funny, originally I was going to just go \u201cmeh\u201d; give this a 50% and count that as good enough, but fact is that this record just isn\u2019t worthy of a mark anywhere near that high. There\u2019s maybe 10, 15 minutes of good stuff in this album, a few riffs scattered around that entertain you for a bit, maybe a moment where the raw emotion that admittedly pervades most of this record finally meets up with some genuine song writing skill, but said moments are far too rare. Sure, there\u2019s an integrity to this- this record is commercial suicide of the highest order- but the fact is that there\u2019s hardly any good music in this, so said integrity counts for nothing. Nope, this is pretty terrible all round, really, though I hate to say it. The fanboy in me tells me to like this, but the plain truth is that this just isn\u2019t worth listening to.\n",
        "\n\u201cEnter Sandman\u201d was Metallica\u2019s first single off their commercially most successful album that was named after the name of the band itself. It is lyrically about a child facing his nightmares and a music video was made for the track, which revolved around the lyrical theme of the track. It was later disclosed that this track went on to become one of the most demanded and most played tracks on the radio following \u201cParanoid\u201d and \u201cStairway To Heaven\u201d.\n\nThis track features Kirk\u2019s first riff with his work with the band. It originally consisted of a two bar riff but as suggested by Lars the first bar was repeated thrice and it was this version that appeared on the album. (That can be seen in Metallica\u2019s documentary \u201cClassic Albums\u201d). The track clocks in at over 5 minutes and the whole song revolves around the base provided by Kirk\u2019s riff. The whole track is clean and simple with no complex parts in between as wasn\u2019t the case with Metallica\u2019s previous releases. James\u2019 voice is nothing less than perfect and Bob Rock has done a great job with the production. Full marks for the excellent production.\n\nAlong with this track there is also a cover of Queen\u2019s track \u201cStone Cold Crazy\u201d but I refrain myself to comment on it because it has already appeared on Metallica\u2019s cover album, \u201cGarage Inc.\u201d\n\nThe setbacks to this track are that the song is too damn repetitive and has a weak solo. Also being the first track off this album it disappointed a huge number of Metallica\u2019s fans who were expecting signature Metallica style thrash, whereas they were handed this radio friendly less aggressive version of Metallica.The only way to enjoy this track if you were a long-standing fan of this track is if you are an open-minded metal head. If you are looking for something that sounds remotely as the band\u2019s early works then this is NOT for you.\n",
        "\n\u201cWherever I May roam\u201d was one of the other tracks off Metallica\u2019s self-titled album. It was in this album that the band tried something different from their previous works. Instead of the adrenaline rush and aggressive nature of music the band opted for a more radio friendly approached which appealed to more of the masses.\n\nThis track is lyrically about a vagabond and like \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d this track had a music video for it too. There are 2 moments that stand out on the track as well as on the album on which it later appeared. These being the intro of the track and the musical marvel at the 30 second mark. The band uses an electric Sitar for the intro, something which none of the metal bands had even tried thus proving Metallica\u2019s ingenious instinct and their talent for innovation and creativity. The other and more brilliant part of the album occurs ay the 30-second mark as I pointed out earlier. It sounds like a horn added by Bob Rock during the production of the album but in fact it is Jason Newstead\u2019s bass guitar, the sound being produced by a 12 string electric bass guitar. Yes, you read it right, a fucking 12 STRING ELECTRIC BASS guitar. Once you realize what the \u201chorn\u201d like sound is you cannot but be envious of Newstead\u2019s obvious talent with the bass guitar.\n\nAnother great part of the track is Lars\u2019 snare attack that literally sounds like an explosion after Jason\u2019s bass crack. Lars just took the snare drum to heights unheard of till then. Also James\u2019 voice is as perfect as perfect can be as is seen throughout the album. The production is excellent and Bob has achieved in the production department what the band couldn\u2019t even dream off till they met him. The track is the longest on the album.\n\nAlong with this track the band also features one of metal\u2019s most famous ballads \u201cFade To Black\u2019s\u201d live performance and a demo version of the song where James\u2019 goes \u201cWana-na-na-na\u201d instead of saying the lyrics because they hadn\u2019t been written yet.\n\nDespite the great moments I have mentioned in the review one cannot help but be disappointed especially if you were a die-hard fan of Metallica\u2019s previous four albums. No trademark aggression, no fast paced adrenaline pumping solos, none of the signature riffs by the band are present here. As mentioned on my review for Enter Sandman, you cannot enjoy tracks like these if they are by Metallica unless you are an open-minded fan of the band. But on the other hand if you are a person who wants to get acquainted with the bands musical works and are looking for some catchy well-produced radio friendly heavy metal then look no further.\n",
        "\nAnother single from \u201c\u2026 And Justice For All\u201d and one must admit nothing much went wrong with this album irrespective of the fact whether you are a Metallica fan or not. This pretty much sums up the track itself but I\u2019d like to elaborate a little.\n\nThough the exact meaning of the lyrics is not known it is pretty sure its anti-government as is the theme of the album on which the track appeared. The fact that the lyrics are against the state of justice that prevails now days can be solidified after one sees the artwork which depict a hand emerging from a skull holding the scales of justice. The lyrics of this track are equally as strong and harsh as the other tracks on the album (And Justice For All, One) but the point to be stressed on is that not only lyrically but musically the sing stands up to them and in their league. It is said that \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d is Metallica\u2019s most technical album to date and this track is as technical as heavy metal can get. The intro to the album where the drums and guitars set in simultaneously is one of the best moments on the album. Lars, in my opinion reached the height of his career on this album and that is obvious in this track. Harvester Of Sorrow is one of the shortest tracks on the album yet as powerful as the others.\n\nThis track can be summed up in the words, excellent. exhilarating . Sigh, just another day at the office for Metallica, and yes this EP contains to pretty well covered songs too but I haven\u2019t commented on them because they appear on a later Metallica album.\n",
        "\nOne. The track which is one of the best metal songs ever made and unarguably the best on the breakthrough album on which it appeared, \u201cAnd Justice For All.\u201d. Okay, first things first. This track had a music video made for it and lyrically it\u2019s about a soldier injured during the first World War. Now about the song\u2026\n\nThe tempo changes on this track are mind-blowing. If one hears just the intro and just the outro it will be impossible for one to believe that they are parts of the same track. The track has a slow acoustic intro with sound effects of a war waging on in the background. The acoustic guitars continue for a good part of 4 minutes and near the 4 minute mark the tempo starts increasing. Then straight from the 4:35 till the end of the track is the time that will change the way you look at metal forever. The machine gun riffs and the aggressiveness have to be heard to be believed. These 3 minutes are Metallica at its best and Lars at his peak. The lyrics of this track are as good as it gets considering the war theme. No wonder this track has become a fan favorite and is played on virtually every show Metallica has played live since its release.\n\nThe only reason I did not give this track a complete 100 is because of the bass which is hardly audible, but then again it wasn't very audible throughout the entire album but the overall awesomeness of the track both musically and lyrically more than made up for it's absence. \"...And Justice For All\" is my favorite Metallica album and one day I may review the whole here on Metal Archives, but before that day comes I just wanted to review one of my favorite Metallica tracks.\n",
        "\nMetallica is the most controversial metal band ever. Universally adored during their early times, their reputation among the metal community was considerably shaken by, firstly, the creation of a music video for the classic \u201cOne\u201d and, secondly, the release of the self titled record (\u201cMetallica\u201d, \u201cBlack Album\u201d, whatever). \nBy this time, there were two sections of the metal community thinking different things about the band; the thrashers were quite furious at them, accusing them to lead the thrash metal genre to ruin with the groovy self-titled; and the rest of the metalheads that enjoyed the \u201cBlack Album\u201d, saying that they had to move on and try new things, in order to not stagnate. In fact, the self titled was generally well accepted by the metal community, thanks to its \u201ccrushing riffs and solos\u201d.\n\nThen, metal went downhill and Metallica took a pause of some years, in order to rest and prepare the new album, the (in)famous \u201cLoad\u201d. By this time, grunge was taking over the music industry, thanks to the mainstream success of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden or Alice in Chains. Everyone was expecting the new Metallica album to resurrect metal, and bring it again to the top.\n\nI guess that the metal community felt betrayed when the music video of \u201cUntil it Sleeps\u201d was leaked, along with pictures of the band without long hair (and with eye-liner and such). \u201cThey are sell-outs!\u201d, even the ones that supported Metallica when the s/t was released were thinking like this. Lars Ulrich even said, one day, that Metallica was no longer a metal band; \u201cwe are a pop band now\u201dsaid the drummer to the journalists. \n\nAnd so, after \u201cLoad\u201d, all the metalheads began to reject and dismiss Metallica. They lost the status of metal gods and the band's legacy (an enormous legacy, I must say) was neglected too. The metalheads divided themselves again; some began saying that early Metallica rocked and such (basically, that the first five albums rocked; however, nowadays, this faction divided itself yet again: now, there are some who say that just RtL and KeA are good albums, mainly because of Mustaine's intervention on them, and others that say that the first four records ruled and so on), and others began saying that \u201cMetallica were never good\u201d (what a lie) and that their impact on metal music is \u201cinsignificant\u201d (LIE).\n\nMetal fans are strange. If a metal band changes its sound, they immediately accuse them of selling out and such. If a metal band stays the same over the years, they immediately criticize it too. A bit unfair, isn't it? Metallica changed their sound and experimented with new things here, on \u201cLoad\u201d, and, of course, the metalheads labeled them as sell-outs. Unfair, indeed.\nSo, is \u201cLoad\u201d atrocious, like many say? Is \u201cLoad\u201d terrible?\nNo, my friends, of course not. Metallica is a fantastic band, songwriting-wise; they can play anything they want to, and still keep the music catchy and solid. I bet you now are thinking that I'm a Metallica fanboy, but this is just the truth, friends.\n\n\u201cLoad\u201d is a bizarre record, mainly because of all the different elements it carries and blends. The heavy metal/hard rock that made the \u201cBlack Album\u201d what it is, is mixed here with some country and blues elements, which, of course, turns this record into a delightful and varied musical piece. The guitars are no longer crunchy and heavy; they are tuned differently, so their sound is less aggressive but still tasteful. \n\nHetfield's riffs shine here, but not because they can crush bones; they shine because they are beautiful and groovy. Kirk is, again, using the wah-wah pedal too much, but that doesn't matter much to me; his solos are emotional and somewhat original. Newsted is finally audible, giving an extra groove to some songs, and Lars Ulrich delivers here a simple but effective work, overusing sometimes the \u201ckick-snare-kick-snare\u201d pattern, but, all in all, his performance is very, very good, dynamic and solid. He is very criticized, nowadays, by the metal community, mainly because of his so-called ability to \u201cruin songs with his horrible drumming\u201d and of the problems with Napster. Anyways, he is pretty good here, in my opinion, especially on \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d, but I'll talk about that song later.\n\nSo, as I've already said, this record is very varied and that is shown by the songs. There are lots of highlights here, in fact. The majority of the tracks are mid-paced and, sometimes, very calm, which makes \u201cLoad\u201d a record that you'll not want to listen everyday. \u201cAin't my Bitch\u201d and \u201cWasting my Hate\u201d are the heavier of the bunch, the first being a truly great song, very powerful, and the second being a pseudo-punk take, featuring some laughable lyrics that fit well with the music. Those tracks also show the incredible vocal approach of James Hetfield; he improved A LOT since the s/t, showing here a very nice vocal range and, most of all, his ability to sing emotionally, which is a thing that I value.\n\nHis emotional approach is highlighted by the incredible amount of ballads and \u201chalf-ballads\u201d present on \u201cLoad\u201d: they are \u201cUntil it Sleeps\u201d, \u201cHero of the Day\u201d, \u201cMama Said\u201d, \u201cBleeding Me\u201d and \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d. I think that all of them absolutely kick ass, except for \u201cUntil it Sleeps\u201d, a song that I consider a bit weak compared to the others, but, hey, it's good, nevertheless. \u201cHero of the Day\u201d features some nice double-bass parts, here and there, and fantastic guitar melodies. It's a very underrated song, in my opinion. The same thing for \u201cMama Said\u201d, despite being a bit weaker. It's an authentic country take, with an anthemic and catchy chorus. Again, not a thing that I want to listen everyday.\n\nAnd now the best part... the two epics, \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d and \u201cBleeding Me\u201d. Well, the latter is an amazing, almost atmospheric song; it has two different sections, the first one is very calm, James Hetfield shines with his amazing vocal performance (\u201cI'm digging my way...\u201d - so beautiful), and the second decently heavy, containing a nice hard rock riff that leads us to the outro, which is very soft again. Honourable mention here to Lars Ulrich too, that, during this song, uses the almighty RIDE CYMBAL!! After just using the hi-hat during the self titled and \u201c...And Justice For All\u201d, he finally understood that using the ride cymbal is a good thing! Yay!\n\nWell, about \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d... I don't have words to describe it. This song is so beautiful, oh my God, this track is one of the best epics Metallica ever made, yeah, it's right there, struggling with \u201c... And Justice For All\u201d and \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d for the prize. I will just say that its chorus is amazing, its bassline gorgeous and its outro stunning. AH, and it also contains an amazing solo. And a great main riff. And complex drumming. And...\n\nForget it. Concluding, despite all the good songs there are some fillers here (\u201cThe Torn Within\u201d, \u201cPoor Twisted Me\u201d), but, fortunately, they don't ruin the whole listening experience. James Hetfield is the man of the record, thanks to his fantastic vocals, as he absolutely reached his peak here. Kirk delivers some good leads and solos and Lars one of his best performances. \n\nOne last word to the fantastic production, one of the reasons why this album is so good. Everything is audible and well mixed, and the record has a nice distinctive sound, thanks to it. The drumkit is the intrument that shines the most because of the production; the snare is not as powerful as on the self-titled but still sounds great and the hi-hat is pretty loud too. About the guitars, they carry a very rock-ish sound, which benefits the whole atmosphere of \u201cLoad\u201d.\nAs you can see, \u201cLoad\u201d is also very long (clocking in at almost 80 minutes), so it requires multiple listens for you to understand its real greatness. That's another characteristic of this record.\n\nSo, open your ears and mind, forget about all the critics surrounding Metallica and enjoy this epic, beautiful, groovy, whatever, record. \u201cLoad\u201d deserves to be heard carefully and as a whole, so that its atmosphere gets you. Absolutely recommended, but forget this piece if you are one of those that label Metallica as sell-outs. I wish this record, in the future, will get the praise it deserves. \nAgain, open your mind, this isn't as bad as many say.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the beginning of \u201c2X4\u201d.\n-the solo section of \u201cThe House Jack Built\u201d.\n-the double bass parts of \u201cHero of the Day\u201d.\n-\u201cI'm digging my way...\u201d\n-the first riff of \"Ronnie\" (which sounds a bit like \"Seek & Destroy\").\n-Everything about \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d.\n",
        "\nWhat does one call this album except \"legendary\"? Released in 1986, Master of Puppets was a underground smash hit, being certified gold within a few months with almost no radio/TV exposure. It is responsible for countless kids getting into thrash, and I don't think there's a metalhead reading this who doesn't own this album (or at least, has heard one or two of the songs from it). From Dream Theater to Trivium to Evile to Machine Head, everyone and their brother today is ripping off Master of Puppets, and you'd better believe there's a reason for that.\n\nThe album continues the prog-thrash found in Metallica's previous album (anyone who bashes MOP while praising RTL is retarded. Stylistically there's no damned difference between the two albums, except MOP has longer songs) but with one major improvement, the production is good. Kill and Ride are great albums, but they do sound very muddy and 80sish. Here, Ulrich' snare sounds crystal clear, and Hammett's guitar packs a delicious punch. The scary thing is, even though it came out in 1986 this still the second or third best produced Metallica album, when you consider the twin botches of And Justice for All and St Anger.\n\nEach song on Master of Puppets is an epic. One of my grips with Ride was you had these wacky half-formed songs like \"Escape\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" that didn't fit in with the rest of the album, but there's none of that problem here. From beginning to end, Master of Puppets like 100% of an album. There's nothing you could add or take away without upsetting the balance. From the savage lockstep thrash of \"Leper Messiah\", to the cruisy basslines of \"Orion\", everything feels complete.\n\nThere are endless catchy riffs (Hetfield cranks them out like an industrial hotdog shooter), and some amazingly complex song structures. Indeed, as you can see on the longer songs, the album was not only an influence on thrash, but on progressive metal, too. Cliff Burton's bass playing is quite groundbreaking. At times he uses his bass like a keyboard or synth to provide instrumental backing (see \"Orion\" and \"Damage Inc\") and at other times he cranks the distortion way up and plays actual guitar riffs (again, see \"Orion\"). He was a truly amazing musician, and it was a great loss to the band when he was tragically killed while touring this album.\n\nThere are a few minor nits and nats I will address shortly (most of which plagued the band from the beginning), but by and large Master of Puppets is one of the most satisfying, value-packed albums I've ever heard. There's lengthy, complex epics, fast thrashers that blow anything on Kill and Ride out of the water (just about every song here has a speed metal section, including the ballad!), and the greatest instrumental of the band's career.\n\nThe album drops the hammer on you with \"Battery\", a hybrid power/thrash song that starts off with a clean guitar intro before cutting into a fast 192bpm thrash assault. The song's riffing is minimalistic and perfectly showcases Hammett's \"venting\" style of playing. A criticism raised by several reviewers is that the intro is out of place. I can see where they are coming from, but can't agree. The song is essentially a power metal song in thrash clothing, and it in no way dilutes the power of the song to have a clean intro. Many thrash bands (Meliah Rage, Metal Church, Dark Angel, and Anthrax, to name a few) have introduced similar ideas to their songs. All in all, \"Battery\" is classic speed metal and the greatest opening to a Metallica album ever...and yet it is only an appetiser to the Master of Puppet's main course.\n\nWords like \"amazing\" and \"genius\" do not even begin to describe track number 2. \"Master of Puppets\" is a heavy metal classic to rival Sabbath's \"Paranoid\", and for me the greatest recording of the band's career. There is not one, not two, but THREE classic riffs in the intro alone (as well as some insanely fast rhythm downpicking), before a highly memorable verse/chorus section, and a melodic dual solo between Hammett and Hetfield. Then there is a crunchy riff-driven build-up which segues into second, harder solo by Hammett, and a final verse and chorus. It's amazing how many emotions and themes can be communicated in 8.5 minutes and a dozen riffs...Loneliness, rage, frustration, helplessness. Everything about this song is amazing. If I could re-write it, I would not change a thing.\n\nThe rest of the album can't help but fall short of \"Master of Puppets\", but there's still lots of great stuff here, as well as some more experimental metal that fucks with your preconceptions. The song that usually gets kicked around the most by the album's critics is \"The Thing that Should not Be,\" and if I may I will offer some words in the song's defense. It's a song about atmosphere, not catchy riffs and singalong choruses. And it succeeds damn well, with slow, crushing riffage and a chaotic, Kerry King-style solo that utterly rips you to shreds. Hetfield's vocals are downright evil on this song. It is also one of the few Metallica songs to employ audio samples (notice the eerie screaming in the song's bridge), turning it into something of a mood piece. It's far from being the best song on the album, but I think I can see where the band was going with it.\n\nTrack 4 is a ballad, and although I'm not wild about Metallica's ballads, \"Sanitarium\" is far better than \"Fade to Black.\" For one thing, it is more aggressive and hard. For another, Hetfield sings in a somewhat masculine voice, rather than sounding like he has an estrogen IV stuck in his arm. The second half is sheer genius, with a chug-chug single-note mosh part and a riff that slowly swells and evolves into a crescendo of melody. Take THIS, all you people who say Metallica doesn't know how to develop their riff ideas!\n\n\"Disposable Heroes\" ratchets the tempo back up and presents an explosive, balls-forward thrash-out session. This song grinds you into the ground with riffs. \"Damage Inc\" is equally fast, but has a sort of spacey, atmospheric vibe to it, mostly propelled by Hammett's minimalistic riffing and Cliff Burton's basslines. This song is triple-A certified headbanger material, and a worthy closer for the record.\n\nThere are, inevitably, a few small points where the album could be improved. Kirk Hammett's solos don't always hit the spot. Half the time it seems like he's throwing in brief noodles because hell, metal songs are supposed to have solos, aren't they? As always, Lars Ulrich is a nonentity. He keeps up a steady beat, but his drumming comes nowhere near to capturing the speed and presence that Hoglan, Bostaph, et al have as a matter of course. And what does he have against double-bass? I can't hear any of it except in \"Leper Messiah.\"\n\nSpeaking of \"Leper Messiah\", this song is something of a weak note. Not because it's bad, but because it's merely a very good song on an album full of amazing ones. The riffs are groovy and slow (although there are some kickass arpeggios in the chorus) and the whole thing sounds repetitive and dry. But hang in there, because the song does improve in the bridge and turns into a nice fast-tempo thrasher. You have to wade through 3-4 minutes of so-so material to get there, though.\n\nIt's scary that, in order to build a case that Master of Puppets sucks, you must resort to such insignificant nitpicks. Some of Master of Puppet's songs aren't as good as they could be, but they are all songs, and (although some are better than others) they are all written to the same level of quality. Can any other thrash album make that claim? The majority of Megadeth's Rust in Peace will forever languish under the shadow of \"Holy Wars\" and \"Hangar 18\", and the same applies to Slayer's Reign in Blood, where there are only two or three songs that even warrant attention. But each song on Master of Puppets can be discussed and analysed at many levels. Something that doesn't seem to occur to most of this album's critics, is that if you can spend 3000 words lecturing on why something is unimportant, perhaps it isn't unimportant after all.\n\nThis album deserves all the praise that has been heaped upon it. It is one of heavy metal's great classics. True perfection will always be unattainable, but Master of Puppets at least has a decent rip at it. If I had to recommend one Metallica album, it would be this. Hail, Master of Puppets...the one and only!\n",
        "\nThis album is like an unprivileged autistic child. Truly brilliant, yet so different from its fellow children, to the extent where very few understand its brilliance, or even sense any speck of wit beneath the difficult-to-penetrate surface of unlikeness. Everyone notices the child sticks out like a sore thumb among its peers and cannot but compare it. Because this child was unprivileged growing up it never had the chance to develop expressing its true cleverness in ways easily perceptible. The child never had a piano or computer they could dazzle skeptics with their aptitude of using it, or a guitar on which it could learn classic 80s Metallica solos for that matter. So it had to learn to express itself on its own terms. It expressed itself in a language few could read, and so only a handful of people understood that the child was truly a saint.\n\nMost of you are likely familiar with the fact that Metallica has changed a great deal since it first rose to fame in the early 80s. The band evolved a great deal in that decade, but this evolution was largely accepted by their fans, partly because standards of what metal should be were not as set in stone at that point. With an even greater change in their sound, 1991\u2019s more rock-oriented Black Album was their first album to draw a great deal of backlash, and each album since has drawn more backlash, and multiplied the uncountable amount of times they have been accused of \u201cselling out\u201d. \n\nSt. Anger is often negatively pointed out by old-school fans as the epitome of what can result if a band \u201csells out\u201d. But in the metal world, \u201cselling out\u201d usually refers simply to a band changing their style from what they defined themselves as when they became popular. In reality, they were probably largely in it for the money from the time they made \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d, and certainly were by the time they signed to Elektra in 1984 - not that this negatively impacts the quality of the music at all. Furthermore, I would argue that St. Anger is actually a much less accessible album than their 1980\u2019s efforts. What Metallica accomplished in the 1980\u2019s was taking thrash metal and smoothing it out, writing/playing it in the pristine calculated way of mainstream rock music \u2013 they were the first (and arguably only) band to make serious thrash metal truly accessible to the masses. Their later 80s albums utilized even more accessible pop-like song writing, but managed to do this within the rules of serious thrash metal, which is the other reason why these albums were still accepted by much of Metallica\u2019s old-school fan base. In the 90s, Metallica decided to make albums which actually were rock - instead of metal that was written and played like rock - and this was deemed unacceptable.\n\nThe backlash behind St. Anger is for different reasons though. This time Metallica attempted to reincorporate elements of the thrash metal which made them famous, but because they had already evolved their sound so far from that, the end result was completely different. But what was particularly unusual is that this album ended up sounding different from not only their 80s material, but from any other metal recording.\n\nIn \u201cSome Kind Of Monster\u201d, the documentary about the making of this album, it is made clear that the members went through an insane amount of emotional turmoil during the making of this album. They had so much difficulty working together that they even had to a have a psychologist with them in the studio. The breed of anger which they were experiencing during this process was so intense and extreme, it transcended the emotional spectrum of traditional thrash metal and could only be expressed in an entirely new kind of metal. The reason this album is so unique is because no other band has ever made an album under such circumstances. Any other band would have simply given up, broken up, and not made an album. But, for reasons financial or otherwise, Metallica knew they simply HAD to make this album and went to the greatest lengths (such as having the shrink in the studio) to ensure that it happened. \n\nMost of the album is in drop-C tuning, creating a much lower guitar sound than Metallica\u2019s earlier works. This tuning and the fact that it is more groove-oriented have caused some comparison to the alternative and nu- metal genres, bands like Mudvayne and Hatebreed also heavily utilizing drop-C tuning and groovy syncopation. This comparison has generally been negative because many people who are intensely into traditional thrash metal cannot understand metal which has evolved to a direction so drastically different from theirs. While there is some similarity to these sort of bands in the guitar sound and in the general feel of certain songs like \u201cShoot Me Again\u201d, this album does include a few riffs which are quite thrash-based, often played at faster tempos than they would be in groove metal. Riffs from \u201cMy World\u201d and \u201cFrantic\u201d come to mind. However, there are also many songs such as \u201cDirty Window\u201d and \u201cSweet Amber\u201d which are based around bluesy rock riffs, the sort one might find on their rock albums Load and Reload. But playing these in the downtuned style and mixing them with thrash and groove metal elements make the whole thing sound like a whole new subgenre... anger metal? Alright, not the best name...\n\nThe drum production is also something many people have reacted to negatively. The drumming itself is solid, not very technical, but composed with a primal brutality effective in keeping the angry guitars in time, and it does contain several interesting patterns, such as the opening to \u201cFrantic\u201d. But the sound of the drums is extremely innovative. The snare sounds like a very tonal tin can which many fans of traditional metal production find obnoxious and weird, but if you listen with an open mind you may find it creates a unique atmosphere and even works as an unconventional countermelody at times when the snare is prominent. The other drums are also triggered unconventionally to make the whole thing sound more primal and raw. While most metal bands would simply underproduce the album if they were going for a rawer feel, Metallica, as previously mentioned, have always made metal from the perspective of rock musicians. They don\u2019t think like the average metal musicians. So instead they heavily produced the album to give it a completely unique aesthetic which evokes those feelings in an unconventional way.\n\nLike I said before, St Anger is actually much less accessible than any other album band has ever made. The strange production contributes to this greatly, as do other elements which differ from the pristine quality of their 80\u2019s pop thrash work. The vocals are often crudely performed and out-of-key, which adds to the aesthetic of the album but is deemed unacceptable by their fanbase because it is imperfect according to convention. The songs are structured to have an extended length and a repetitiveness which is not broken up by any solos. Solos were another pristine characteristic of their earlier work that would have simply detracted from their expression of \u201cThe Unnamed Feeling\u201d they were experiencing, this extreme strain of anger few have ever known. \n\nThe relentless repetition reinforces this expression, and like all the other unconventional elements, work perfectly to one who knows how to take in \u2013 how to enjoy this album to its fullest. However, I believe that this album sounds to the average metalhead similarly to what metal sounds like to someone to doesn\u2019t listen to metal, and this is precisely where the brilliance of the whole thing lies. Every aspect of the album reflects this, with vocals that are considered grating (just as people who don\u2019t listen to metal often cite to the vocals as being too listener unfriendly), repetition that is considered unnecessary, a drum sound that is considered obnoxious, and a guitar sound which is considered too heavy (frankly this is what the detractors really think). Basically, this album is too much of a BEAST for most people to handle, even for those that listen to heavy music. While most music listeners don`t even understand metal, most metal listeners don`t understand this album. So this is like metal squared, because in addition to the regular level of tolerance required to enjoy any metal at all, this album requires an additional dimension of tolerance. \n\nBased on what I\u2019ve heard about the members and their interactions in \u201cSome Kind Of Monster\u201d, as well as listening to the techniques they used in all their earlier work, I think it is safe to say that spitting in the face of convention this stingily was not quite the band\u2019s intention. Birthing an autistic child is not the average parent\u2019s intention, and Metallica do not seem like they would be interested in making their music avant-garde. If somebody with a Mike Patton sort of reputation made this album, it would be interpreted quite differently \u2013 though I\u2019m definitely not saying that this fits in the niche of something the average Patton fan would enjoy. It`s a very different kind of avant-garde. I think these guys simply wanted to express an anger which consumed them to the extent that it became holy to them, hence the album title. And the result was an extremely unorthodox album which yields many rewards for those who happen to know how to listen to it.\n",
        "\nEverything's wrong with this song. Metallica was given a chance to compose a kick ass soundtrack and mysteriously failed. Yes, I'm ironic. \"I disappear\" is in fact a preview of all the disastrous releases Metallica would have published for the next years, and continues doing until nowadays.\n\nAs I said, everything in this song is utter shit. Starting from the initial lyrics:\n\nHey Hey Hey \nHere I go now \nHere I go into new days \nHey Hey Hey \nHere I go now \nHere I go into new days \nI\u2019m pain, I\u2019m hope, I\u2019m suffer \nYeah Hey Hey Hey Yeah Yeah \nHere I go into new days \n\n...which are pretty much the same during all of the song, except for a repetitive \"don't bury me when I'm gone\". And yes, the singing is horrible, the voice is really disturbing, sounding more like a tough redneck rather than Hetfield's voice. If there isn't this disastrous non-melodic voice, there is the choruses pleading whine, which makes things worse.\n\nAnd for the other musical parts, it's just the same crap, an enormous evidence that Metallica have sold out since their beloved/blamed \"Black Album\". Kirk Hammett's guitar parts are the real big frustrating detail. I mean, it's just incredible: a faint wah-wah effect during the song and a basic bluesy solo in the chorus. The bass parts don't even exist, while the drum parts are simply reduced to a simple crash/hi-hat-pedal-snare drum tempo, with NO double bass. Forget the acoustic version of this awful song, it's just more proof of Metallica's awful sellout.\n",
        "\nOne guaranteed way to get a reaction from a thrash fan is to mention the word \"Metallica\". Best take cover after mentioning that word, though, because it won't be long before you're covered in spittle from said fan furiously explaining that a) Metallica were only good when Mustaine was around (which is completely false, no one knows which riffs he wrote, and besides AJFA slayed) b) Metallica ripped riffs off other people, or the most perplexing option- c) that Metallica were never any good anyway.\n\nYep, the final group is pretty freakin' hard to understand. I have no problem with people disliking Metallica over Napster and St.Anger, and if Megadeth fans want to show their solidarity with Dave by making the \"Mustaine was Metallica\" claim then that's OK with me. But to deny the life affirming beauty that are the first four albums of this great/once great (circle whichever you think applies) band is frankly bizarre and quite masochistic, somewhat akin to those monks who eat only bread and water in an attempt at increased piety. \n\nThe simple question, really, is why eat bread and water when you can feast on the glory that is this album? I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that this is an amazing thrash album, easily the best ever, and those who prefer Darkness Descends, Rust in Peace, Pleasure to Kill or even Reign in Blood are somewhat misguided. They dourly eat the gruel when there is a banquet to be had. They drink their vinegar when there is fine red wine. \n\nSure, Ride the Lightning isn't the fastest, or the heaviest, or the most aggressive. It doesn't have the most riffs, and it's not the most technical thrash out there. It certainly doesn't have the best drumming. However, none of those factors matter that much; Ride The Lightning is more then the sum of it's parts, and what it lacks in those perhaps more objective fields it makes up for in it's sheer songwriting excellence and epic arrangements.\n\nYep, every song is gold. It's pretty hard to pick a single song and go \"That is the best one on this album\" because they're all fucking excellent; you've got the steamrolling thrash that is \"Fight Fire with Fire\" (which possesses possibly the finest twin guitar lead ever written), the boner inducing, F# riding, insanely fun to play speedy excellence that's \"Trapped Under Ice\", and the super melodic, almost radio-friendly strains that is \"Escape\". Every song here has been written with the poise and skill of a surgeon- certainly Metallica let no filler pass them by at this time in their career, an attitude that I wish they had kept.\n\nStill, while the songs mentioned above are pretty hard to beat, they're not the best songs on this album. Perhaps it was all the Jagermeister they were drinking, or god/satan/scientific method came down and touched Hetfield's picking hand, but everything else in this album is just something else entirely. Ride the Lightning is a beast of a thrasher, and I guess I should credit where credit is due and point that Mustaine must\u2019ve written some of it. It\u2019s a bit more opaque and perhaps a bit less catchy then most of the album, but it still kills and I think everyone wishes Hetfield could still do that scream in the bridge. Hammett shows his skills with the quite excellent ballad that\u2019s Fade to Black, with Hammett\u2019s licks on this one probably the best thing Mr.Kirk ever recorded- head and shoulders above anything else he\u2019s done. It\u2019s a fantastic ballad that to this day still sends shivers down my spine. You\u2019ve then got another thing that Metallica would not quite achieve again- the instrumental that\u2019s solid for the whole nine minutes. No boring melodic stuff like Orion, no terrible doom riffing like To Live is To Die, just ominous, powerful mid paced riffs that build brilliantly until its\u2019 huge ending comes along and shits on your chest.\n\nThen we get to the song (well, we're not going by track listing, but I digress..) that proves just how deserving this album is of the title I bestowed it. It's hard to discuss the sprawling, epic thrash that's Creeping Death without resorting to page after page of superlatives and excited, breathless swearing, but the fact of the matter is that this one song- this one single song- is absolute musical perfection. There's the pounding, awe inspiring intro riff that makes parting the red sea seem fairly dull in comparison, the chorus can only be described as \"fucking woo man, shit woooah\", and that's all before an epic solo leads into something that could almost be described as a 'breakdown' comes in at the bridge, with some rather tasty chanting (I've noticed that this is the Metallica album with the most samples- name another Metallica album with an evil god laughing, a thunderclap, bells, synths and sirens) and just general crushing-ness. It will remove your limbs.\n\nAnd I guess the good thing about said limb removal is that it\u2019s just so freaking memorable. When I came to write this review I hadn\u2019t really listened to RTL for maybe 3 years. However, the instant I put on Fight Fire With Fire every single riff came flooding back. Heck, even the drum lines are catchy- I\u2019d be hard pressed to find another album that I could air drum in its entirety. There just really wasn\u2019t any other thrash band that made things just so damn catchy without sacrificing any semblance of heaviness. This is still a heavy beast of an album- still brutal and unfriendly to many a mainstream listener today- but it\u2019s got more hooks then a hook making factory. I have spent weeks before repeating the Creeping Death chorus over and over in my head; I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever done that too, say, Megadeth\u2019s \u201cPolaris\u201d.\n\nNow, I\u2019m aware that saying an album is \u2018catchy\u2019 or \u2018memorable\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s the best thing ever. Linkin Park are \u2018catchy\u2019. Sean Paul is \u2018catchy\u2019 (typing this actually got his \u201cRight Temperature\u201d song stuck in my head again.) However, Metallica back up this catchiness with genuinely excellent, amazing material. I\u2019m happy that this is a record full of varied, supremely excellent thrash; if I also end up humming it when I\u2019m in the shower that\u2019s a bonus as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nTo conclude, then. There\u2019s not really anything I can say that\u2019s bad about this album. \u201cEscape\u201d is possibly the weak point but it\u2019s still an excellent song. Overall, this is a life changing beast of an album that everyone needs to hear more then once.\n\nIs it the heaviest? No. Does it have the most riffs? No. Is it the best? YES.\n",
        "\nI think by now most people have been confounded by Metallica's career at one point. It was smooth sailing for the most part until they got shown the light of success. From that point on, every step Metallica has made has proven to be a mistep. The Black Album was very successful, but at the price of integrity; a former thrash giant turned into a pop metal outfit. As the popularity of metal waned, they tried to cash in on the popularity of alt-rock, and failed miserably, for the most part because Load had \"poser\" written all over it. They simply tried to be something they're not. Which brings us to this. This is another misstep in the career of Metallica. \n\nLoad was thoroughly rejected by most self-respecting metalheads, but embraced, if not coldly, by the \"music press\" consisting mostly of MTV and the like. So Metallica decided something: If the massive amounts of money they made from the black album and Load were good, then MOAR MONEY would be better! So what better way to make more money with the least amount of effort than to fill an album up with b-sides and rejects? \n\nWhich is what they did here. Again, another misstep. While *slightly* more metal than Load, it makes up for it in that while at least Load was somewhat well thought out, Reload was not. I do not consider Re-Load to be a proper album. Sure, it is a collection of songs pressed to CD, but as far as an album goes, while at least Load was coherent, this is not. It goes from being more metal oriented (do not confuse metal-oriented with actual metal) to being complete rock, not even of the hard kind. Metallica has lost their edge, no doubt about it, but this comes off as a last ditch attempt to gain respect, which of course is not going ot happen because this is unabashed commercialism, and nobody respects you for that. \n\nThe one song a lot of people like, Fuel, is good at 1 or 2 listens, and while being catchy, it's kind of a stupid song, and gets annoying real quickly. The Unforgiven was a snorefest to begin with; The Unforgiven II is doubly the snorefest. \n\nI don't think I can really pick choice cuts out of this mess; I can name songs that are complete shit, like Fixxxer, Low Man's Lyric, and Better Than You, but I cannot name choice cuts, because it seems to be either completely forgettable or only memorable due to extreme amounts of suck and fail.\n\nAs well, this is not the last misstep in Metallica's career. Following this was S&M, which was more cacaphony than music, and St. Anger, which was a pathetic and poorly produced attempt to cash in on the Numetal trend. Metallica really have got to be the biggest sellouts in the history of music. I cannot name any artist who made a bigger about-face and pissed on their legacy more than Metallica. While St. Anger takes the cake for being the absolute worst of Metallica, Reload is up there among their list of abominations and embarrassments to the world of music.\n",
        "\nYou know the embarrassment you get when your parents sing along to your music, horribly off key and without any sense of what the music's about? I get the same feeling here. Why?\n\nMetallica, by now, had gotten into quite a formulaic \"rut\" in their process of making music. It wasn't an honor to record anymore, it wasn't a \"fun\" thing to do, it was a chore, and writing music now something dreaded not something celebrated. They wrote music based off of what's popular, not what they feel deep down inside. That worked when the music Metallica were good at making -- Metal -- was popular. When shit changed, and metal wasn't popular anymore, replaced by alternative, Metallica had 2 options. One was to go back to their original sound, say fuck you to the record executives, and go back to being a more \"underground\" outfit, sacrificing fame and fortune for integrity and quality. The second option was to attempt to follow the trends at the time and make an alt-rock album. We all know what Metallica did, right? \n\nThis could've at least worked somewhat if Metallica were any good at writing alt-rock songs. Unfortunately, they weren't. They forgot to throw away all the jigs and zigs in the shop before they went to record a new album, and thus made another \"Black Album\", but crudely molded and hammered into something resembling an alt-rock album. By crudely, I don't mean the production; it's pretty much crystal clear. I'm referring to the songwriting. The same riffs show up, but mutilated and sterilized. They were not meant for hard rock, and no amount of regurgitating of the same set of chords will make them work. The drums are done poorly, but Lars was never a good drummer, it's the energy that was his strength in earlier albums, and his sloppy style works to the detriment here. The solos consist of vulgar amounts of wah; it's almost as if Kirk is hiding his lack of talent (or obscuring any shred of talent he does have) with the excessive wah. Either way, it sounds like shit. He does not know how to use wah right at all. The singing is laughable, with James' JD'ed-out voice barely choking out the lines, and sounding laughable whilst doing it.\n\nThe image around this time couldn't be worse, with Lars proclaiming that \"Heavy Metal is dead\" and the cutting of the hair. It proves that Metallica are the worst kind of sellout, and their post-Justice history will forever be a sordid example of blatant commercial degradation.\n",
        "\nLet me establish something first: I never considered Metallica anything new or original, even in their glory days. Kill Em' All was raw, beer-fueled aggression, sure, and Ride the Lightening was pure thrash to the core. But it had been done before, by bands better at it, in greater quantities. Most of the riffs that made Ride the Lightening and Kill Em' All great were Mustaine riffs, and you could definitely start to hear the absence of Mustaine on Master of Puppets. And on this, you can REALLY hear the absence of Mustaine, as well as the lack of any bass presence whatsoever (Newsted isn't to blame, it's the band and the producer), lending it a rather one dimensional sound. \n\nI have a theory that Hetfield was never really a riff genius. He wrote some great lyrics back in the days when they went through rough times (loser lunch, anybody?), and hell, he's come up with a good riff or two. But most of the good riffs from Kill Em' All and Ride the Lightening were most likely written by Mustaine. Metallica didn't dramatically sell out with the Black Album, Load/Reload, and St. Anger. James/Lars (the other two don't really have any creative control, it seems) have have been sellouts long before it showed any signs, even back in the Master of the Puppets days. Why do I mention that album? Because it's basically a facsimile of Ride the Lightening, but instead of being fresh and innovative, it was tired and boring, the \"epic\" songs long and meandering and the thrash songs copies of past genius. Remember when they went on MTV for the first time, and spent the speech whining and bitching about how they didn't get their MTV? They've always wanted money and fame. It's just that when the tide of music started turning, and metal wasn't so popular anymore, they tried making a modern rock album (Load) and when Numetal was really popular, they made a numetal album (St. Anger). \n\nWhat does that have to do with ...And Justice For All? Everything. It was made with the same mentality as the Black Album, Load/Reload, and St. Anger. That is, they write songs for the fans, not themselves. They don't use introspection to create metal that came from the depths of their soul, they just write what they think the fans will like, what will be popular. It shows, here, because even though it's touted as progressive thrash, it's not real progressive, and it's really more heavy metal than thrash metal. More specifically, Metallica wanted to create music that was \"epic\" and slower than their usual fare. That's a good intention and all, but it's entirely disingenuous if there's no real desire for change. See, Metallica are using the same riffs, Kirk doing the same solos, and Lars doing the same drum patterns as always. They wanted to change for superficial reasons, and because of that, little actual change occured. \n\nHaving heard music made around the same time attempting the same thing but doing it several times better, ...And Justice For All can't help but sound mediocre. James is a mostly pentatonic riff writer, and you can't really do \"epic\" with pentatonic riffs, and that's what he tries to do here a lot, and it comes off sounding cheesy and half-baked. His gruff bark, which works for thrash, doesn't work for epics. His cleaner style sounds forced and rather thin, akin to another heavy metal giant of the period, Jon Oliva. Both are better off barking along to pugilistic heavy metal than singing along to more ballad-y music. As well, the \"yeah\"s and the \"uh-huh\"s and other cliche'd rockstar-isms Hetfield uses are annoying as hell, and further detract from the seriousness of what they're attempting. \n\nBut it takes much more terrible vocals to ruin good music, but, alas, if ...And Justice For All had good music. It doesn't. It has mediocre riffs with mediocre solos on top of mediocre drumlines. The bass, of course, doesn't factor in at all. Of course, Justice for All is nowhere near as aggravatingly MTV as the Black Album nor is it as downright embarrassing as Load/Reload and St. Anger, as this is years before Hetfield & Co. started scraping the bottom of the artistic barrel.\n",
        "\nIn 1983, Metallica was just a modest and unknown band, in love with the aggression of Motorhead and with the speed and complexity of many of the british heavy metal acts, most notably Iron Maiden and Diamond Head. This marriage of styles originated this album, which emerged from an american scene still dominated by glam rock bands. Although this album is hailed as one of the first thrash metal albums ever released, it still doesn't sound like pure thrash metal in my opinion, as all the songs aren't JUST made of speedy guitar work and basic song structures. In fact, there are lots of progressive elements here and there, like tempo changes and breakdowns. The Four Horsemen, Seek and Destroy and the underrated Phantom Lord are examples of that, as they all have amazing middle sections. Don't get me wrong though, this album is one of the first thrash metal albums, but it isn't THAT aggressive, especially if we compare it with the early works of other thrash acts like Overkill and (obviously) Slayer. The tunes here are all pretty fast but the riffs kind of retain a somewhat happy and triumphant vibe, something absent on, for example, Show No Mercy.\n\nObviously, the most important thing of this album is the guitar work. The riffs are the meat of Kill'em All, and there's a lot of good ones here. Almost every tune has a memorable main riff or an interesting solo, which is great. Phantom Lord is an authentic thrash monster, with its NWOBHM-influenced main riff; Motorbreath follows the same path and Whiplash also contains some of the most aggressive and inspired riff ever crafted by this american act. Obviously the riff progressions are very primitive and basic, but at this time they were just an amateur band so that's perfectly understadable. Still, some songs here contain some progressive elements, which is rather surprising. Take Four Horsemen, for instance. After the usual fast first section, we reach a tremendous breakdown, with a nice solo and clean guitar lines. This is what makes Metallica different; while the majority of the other acts were just focusing on the aggression and power of their music, Metallica tried something more elaborate and, dare I say?, intelligent with songs as the already mentioned Four Horsemen.\n\nOn other hand, the lyrics here are hilarious. While not speaking about Satan and darkness and killing goats, their lyrical subjects were, hm, just laughable, really. Behold.\n\n\"With all out screaming \nWe are gonna rip right through brain \nWe got the lethal power \nIt is causing you sweet pain on sweet pain \nWhen we start to rock \nWe never want to stop again\"\n\n\"Thunder and lighting the gods \nTake revenge \nSenseless destruction \nVictims of fury are covardly now \nRunning for safety \nStabbing the harlot to pay for her sins \nLeaving the virgin \nSuicide running as if it were free \nRipping and tearing\"\n\nTwo very poetic examples, indeed. Fortunately, Hetfield improved a lot as a lyricist later on. Ah, and speaking about Hetfield, while his rhythm guitar is obviously excellent, his vocal performance is terrible. He wasn't a singer in the first place, and we all know that Metallica wanted John Bush, from Armored Saint, to be their vocalist. Bush didn't want to join Metallica though, so James had to sing. Technically, he's, as I've already said, terrible, but he has lots of attitude and enthusiasm. On Hit the Lights, for example, he sounds like a maniac, which really fits with the whole atmosphere of the track. During most of the times though, he sounds like a NWOBHM wannabe singer, which isn't good. That said, there are still worser vocalists out there.\n\nSo, highlights? First of all, Four Horsemen. Phantom Lord too. No Remorse is also excellent and truly underrated, it's a shame no one speaks about that track. Nice first section, filled with a couple of rather long guitar solos, leading us to the final part, dominated by a simple but very intense riff. There's an incredible live version of this tune out there, when Metallica played the song in 2003, in a small venue, I can't really remember where. It's worth watching, excellent live performance. Curiously, No Remorse was the result of the mixture between two tunes from Hetfield's former band, Leather Charm. Hit the Lights is also a very competent opener and finally Whiplash closes the list of highlights, one of the most aggressive Metallica songs, really. Energic and powerful, this song has it all. The other tunes are all pretty average, my least favourite probably is Jump in the Fire, a very boring tune with some uninspired riffing and drumming.\n\nThe production is rather weak, but what would you expect? So, a fine thrash metal record, all in all, but Metallica improved and released much better albums after this one. Still, a must have for thrash fans, as Kill'em All was one of the pieces that really shaped and created the genre. \n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the middle part of Four Horsemen.\n",
        "\nAhhh ...And Justice For All. The soundtrack to that halcyon summer before I started junior high. This album is forever linked to my first beer, ciggy and porno movie. Needless to say I have a soft spot for this album but I will try to stay objective. Did I also mention that this was the winning shot in the thrash vs. glam wars? Yes this album but Metallica on the radio. Consequently all the glam fans started to listen to Metallica and you got the Black Album. Thats why it gets a 90. \n\nThis album gets a lot of flak over the production. It's too dry? Who really wants to listen to reverb tails feeding back and muffling the sound? The drums are strange? Well, thats only because they basically pieced the drum parts together measure by measure, not fun in those pre-Pro Tools days. You can't hear the bass? Having seen Metallica live about 3 times I can honestly say you don't want to hear the bass. It's not like Jason Newsted was Jaco Pastorius. Hell, he wasn't even Kip Winger. The production is tinny? Are you listening to the album on your headphones from 1988? This was the album that forced metal heads to get kicker boxes and speakers made out of a material other than paper. The Mesa Boogie Mark IIc's put out enough low end to make you sterile. This is the one criticism that has gone on for too long. Invest in some speakers. \n\nBlackened, Shortest Straw and Dyer's Eve will all tear your head off. Greatest songs to skateboard to. I know that there were faster bands and drummers but no one infiltrated thrash into society like Metallica did. Eye of the Beholder and Harvester of Sorrow are the groove that they were looking for in their 90's albums. Sad that it was right in front of their faces the whole time. Which brings me to the long songs. ...And Justice For All and To Live Is To Die are just flat out self-indulgent but you have to give them a break as they were working out the ghost of Cliff Burton with the latter. That leaves us with Frayed Ends of Sanity. I don't know what to make of this song. It's somewhat fast. It's kinda got a proggy riff. It's got the coolest Wizard of Oz opening in heavy metal. Yet it somehow leaves me cold. I'm noncommittal on this particular song. The strength of this album is that it is an album take it all in as a whole. War, insanity, death, fire are all tried and true heavy metal subjects. The communist witch hunts of the 50's and environmental disaster are not. At least not until this album. \n\nSo whatever the faults of this album it still holds a place in my heart. Music for me is invariably tied to the emotions I had when I first heard it. This album will always remind me of the sheer hedonism of youth. Skate and destroy my friends. Thrash if you got 'em.\n",
        "\nOk, Metallica. What the hell is this? You've made some good stuff in the past, heck, I'll even go to saying 'Load' was a good album, but this is just stupid. \n\nThere is nothing funny about this music, yet every time I listen to it I find myself laughing. From the moment it starts with \"Fuel\" it's hilarious. This song sounds like a comedy act at the beginning. The song itself is one of the worst I\u2019ve heard and some people regard it as a classic. WOW! In fact, the whole album feels like this to tell you the truth. There is one song that is worthwhile, that being \"The Memory Remains\", which I actually like a lot.\n\nMetallica now has to rely on past talent and success to make it. Take for example writing a song called \"Unforgiven II.\" Sure, the first one was alright, but this is the same kind of thing, just, not as good. What's next, \"One 2\", \"Enter Sandman Once Again\", or \"Son Of The Master Of Puppets?\" You decide Metallica because I wouldn't be surprised if one of these was on your next album. \n\nThe music on this disc is very lame when after listening to Metallica\u2019s better stuff. You have one riff at the beginning of the song which is just alright. I\u2019m fine with that, but Metallica feels the need to base the whole song off of that one repetitive riff instead of doing what they used to do by creating songs that were varied and interesting.\n\nOne song called \u201cLow Man\u2019s Lyric\u201d is particularly bad. At the beginning there is some very odd sounding guitar playing slowly something that could be from some old bagpipe tune. Then there are some very annoying hums in the background creating the effect of a horrible attempt at an interesting atmosphere. The song goes on for seven minutes and does nothing interesting.\n\nThen there\u2019s songs like \u201cFixxxer\u201d that sound like Rage Against The Machine (a band I hate) on crack, mostly because the whole song is based on an absolutely horrible riff. \u201cDevil\u2019s Dance\u201d has lame, boring drumming and then guitars that sound like they are filled with mud and being played by 13 year olds. Even the vocals are not as interesting as they used to be and hearing him say stuff like \u201cYeah, yeah!\u201d in every song becomes intensely irritating. \n\nThe melodic choruses from previous albums have been discarded for short, repetitive, un-melodic lines of horrible lyrics. There is no intense soloing in the songs like there was in previous albums \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, or \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d and everything makes you wonder why these artists even bother. It seems as if this band knows they are popular, knows their albums will sell, so they turn out as many as they can to make money. This disgusts me.\n\nI wish I never got this album. I can\u2019t even think of Metallica without thinking of this horrible album. I can't even enjoy their older stuff anymore without being bothered by them stooping this low. If you are a fan of this group then take my advice and don\u2019t get this album. Please don\u2019t because it will cause you nothing but pain and suffering.\n\nA bad album is forgivable. A stupid album is not. These songs range from repeats of old songs to songs that sound like a spoof of a Metallica song. It\u2019s like some kind of twisted wannabe Metallica band who doesn\u2019t really know anything about music. I can\u2019t help but shake my head and sigh when I see this album sitting on the shelf.\n\nTo conclude, I really don't like any of these songs except the one I mentioned. The album itself is repetitive. Each song sounds similar to the last and it was very difficult to get all the way through this. I did and I wish I didn't. Sure, there are some \"sick riffs\" and a lot of \"wicked guitar\" and even some \"like really fast drumming.\" Sure there are. Don't make me laugh, I've laughed enough listening to this.\n",
        "\nThere's not too much to say about this EP than it's a good one. Back in 1984 it had some kind of meaning to the Metallica fans but today, it's just meaningless. You find it all somewhere in a bigger and overall better package today but is there some reason to own this EP as it is? Well, yes because it's still a cool EP and it's from the days when Metallica actually were good.\n\nIt features one song written by Metallica and two covers. They've chosen to include the excellent \"Creeping Death\" from \"Ride The Lightning\". It doesn't need any further description as you probably already know about that song and it's quality but about the covers then? Yeah, the \"Blitzkrieg\" cover is the weakest track on this EP but it's still good but the real jewel that makes this EP interesting is the Diamond Head-cover of \"Am I Evil?\". It's a real true metal classic. They've made a little heavier than the original and also extended the intro which is a plus for the Metallica verison. There's two reasons why Diamond Head's version is better though. Lars doesn't do one of the bass drum slams all the time and Kirk didn't do the solo as good as Brian Tatler, although it still sounds awesome!\n\nI think you should dig this up instead of \"Garage Inc.\" since it's from their better years and \"Garage Inc.\" is a lot bigger, but it has a lot more shit than this aswell. This one features a cool cover unlike \"Garage Inc.\" aswell...\n\nCheck it out! R.I.P. Metallica 1981-1991\n",
        "\nThe Black Album, Metallica's biggest selling album, and the album that singlehandedly brought metal to the attention of MTV and the mainstream, opens with one of their best songs, \"Enter Sandman\", a simple, five-minute metal anthem. It would be a huge hit, although Metallica didn't know that when they were recording it. It would also be the last true metal anthem, the last true glorious celebration of heavy metal, that Metallica ever did.\n\nThe concept behind the Black Album was a good one. On the fantastic \"...And Justice For All\", every song was over five minutes and only two were under six. Metallica had gradually been growing longer and more overwrought since the early thrash of \"Kill Em' All\" expanded into the twin metal masterpieces of \"Ride The Lightning\" and \"Master Of Puppets\", which expanded into the ambitious, extended suites of the odyssey that was .\"..And Justice For All\". It had to eventually collapse on itself-the only place for Metallica to go was short and to the point, and this album accomplishes that. The members of Metallica should not be strung up by their thumbs for evolving and changing their sound. This is what great bands do. And the album itself shouldn't be penalized because of the extremely disappointing, alternative style \"Load\" and \"Reload\", and then the horrific \"St. Anger\", which wouldn't have been so bad but for being made by the band that once played \"Master Of Puppets\". And it also shouldn't be penalized because it caught on with the mainstream and alternative crowds, because although that goes against the thrash ideals that Metallica upheld on their first four albums, it's not Metallica's fault that they liked it. In fact, this album converted many of them to metalheads, who then went out and bought Pantera and Anthrax albums. And most of all, it shouldn't be penalized for the actions of the band after they became huge, including the Napster business and the rehab that made the band a joke. Very rarely is this album listened to objectively, so this is what I tried to do.\n\nAs I said, the album opens with the fantastic \"Enter Sandman\", which is easily the best song on the album. In fact, the entire first half of the album is very strong, or at least stronger then the second half, with \"Sad But True\", \"Holier Than Thou\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Wherever I May Roam\", and \"Don't Tread On Me\". \"Enter Sandman\" basically perfectly executes what Metallica was attempting with this album, a powerful, concise metal headbanger. The riffs are simple, the drums are simple, the lyrics are simple, even Kirk's solo comes in, does its job, then gets out. But it all ties together in a way that's more accessible then their early thrashers but still is instantly recognizable. In my opinion, it's really the only song on the album that perfectly encapsulates what the band was intending-make it simple but keep it Metallica. And it's followed by the very good \"Sad But True\", which follows the Enter Sandman blueprint-just a little less. It's actually my favorite song on the album other then Sandman. As opposed to the crazy speed metal on their first four albums, it takes a menacing, slower pace, with rhythmic, pulsing chords and some of James' best singing on the album. It's a little more alternative and nu metal then their early work, but I think it holds up with a lot of it, especially because of the very well done solo by Kirk-it's heavy on the wah-wah, but it definitely keeps you interested. \n\nFollowing that is \"Holier Then Thou\", which, along with \"Don't Tread On Me\", makes up the standard Metallica thrasher section of the first half. It keeps the good streak going-it's basically good ol' standard Metallica riffage. It's still not fast enough to quite qualify with older works like, say \"Battery\"or \"Damage Inc.\", but it's one of the more effective works on the album. The strong point is actually the verses, which showcase the very good lyrics (regarding James' distaste for organized religion) and the good riff. Kirk's solo goes on a little too long, and it could have done without a little of the end, but it's still doing well. So far, the album is succeeding. \"Don't Tread On Me\", though, two songs later, really fails. The riff is really just mediocre (for Metallica, anyway), but it's real problem is that it's just ordinary. There's nothing really special-it's not too fast, the solo is standard (cut back on the wah-wah, Kirk), and the choruses, where James is yelling \"DON'T-TREAD-ON-ME!\" comes off much more silly then awesome. However, this is a little later-there's still one more special song on the first half.\n\n\"The Unforgiven\" is after \"Holier Than Thou\", and it's one of the best songs on the album-it's dark, acoustic, moody, depressing, and very well done. As a song, it's very good-the problem is that it really isn't the sort of song that has too much replay value. Although I immediately acknowledged its mastery when I heard it, I found myself skipping over it when I was listening to the album the next few times on my iPod. Even so, it's one of the best songs they have to offer, and if the end was thrashier, it would be a great Metallica epic in the spirit of \"One\" and \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\". A little riffage would have helped.\n\nUnfortunately, this really ends the special streak. After four songs of sustained skill, \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"Don't Tread On Me\" give the album a punch in the gut. One of the things Metallica has been renowned for is the ability to write six, eight, or even nine (in the case of ...And Justice For All's title track) minute songs and keep you interested the whole time-this is why \"...And Justice For All\" is considered classic Metallica. But since it's slowed down, \"Wherever I May Roam\" simply succeeds in boring you. If Bob Rock's job was to make their sound more concise, he certainly failed here. And the aforementioned \"Don't Tread On Me\" is just sort of sad.\n\n\"Through The Never\" opens the next half of the album, and it does a relatively good job of making up for \"Don't Tread On Me\", although it doesn't quite salvage the album. The verses can get boring, but the chorus and the opening riff (repeated throughout the song) more then make up for it. A solid, if unspectacular. But then comes the song that really kills the album. \"Nothing Else Matters\" is disgusting. It goes against everything Metallica stands for. James isn't growling. There's no riff-it's a ballad. Even when it gets a little angrier, it immediately goes back to James actually singing and acoustic guitars. The whole song reeks of radio and an attempt to be more successful-and I find it pitiful. It's followed by \"Of Wolf And Man\" and \"The God That Failed\", both of which go a little bit towards making up for some of the crap. The former is a standard thrasher that benefits from a great riff. The latter is another six-minute epic, but it does a better job keeping you interested, and the solo is great. And then it screws it all up with the last two songs, which fully condemn the album to never be truly classic Metallica. \"My Friend Of Misery\" is slow, depressing, and it fails. By slowing it down, Bob Rock and the band took away their ability to keep your attention. It overstays it's welcome and really doesn't do anything interesting. And the final song, \"The Struggle Within\", is an uninspired thrash standard that really does nothing to warrant listening to it any more then once or twice. And that's it.\n\nThe problem with the album is that it's poorly executed. The idea is a good one, \"Enter Sandman\" and \"Sad But True\" prove that a little slower and more accessible can be done well. But there's so much filler on the album-\"The Struggle Within\" and \"Don't Tread On Me\" both just go through the motions of a true great Metallica headbanger. And so much is unspectacular that it needs to be cut, or have some new ideas inserted. But the maddening thing is this-at least half the album has spots of true greatness. When I hear a crazy solo or a great riff buried in these songs, it makes me mad, because I hear the old Metallica in there. I consider Metallica's career like a line. On one half is their amazing first metal part. On the other half is their disappointing alternative part. This album is a dot in the middle-it seems split right down between the two. So why, you ask, have I given as high a rating as I have? \n\nIt's simple. This is still Metallica. The greatest metal band ever. The worst moments on the album would be the best on many other young metal bands. It falls a little short by Metallica's standards, but by anyone else's, it would be great. And this is reviewed on the basis of objective quality, not on a comparison to their early work. So I recommend you buy this album, simply because it's still Metallica and that alone makes it worth buying. Besides, as the biggest selling metal album of all time, it would criminal to call yourself a metal fan and not know this album, simply for the sake of history. As an album-good. But as Metallica-short.\n\nA little addendum-I was listening to this on iTunes. As Struggle Within ended, it moved on to the next song-Battery, the opener to Master Of Puppets. I sat there, listened to Battery, and sighed. Out with the classic old, in with the slightly flawed new. And it's just not the same.\n",
        "\nI know it\u2019s just one more review about an overviewed album, but I can\u2019t hide my annoyance about the way that metalheads polarize their opinions; I mean, I agree that everyone is free to speak what\u2019s in their minds and (is a clich\u00e9, I know) each one of us has his own opinion, but there are many ways to tell them to others, I think. It\u2019s easy to be destructive by saying everyone that Metallica sold out with this album and songs became so shitty and this is no fucking metal, but a loss of integrity and so on and so on. It\u2019s almost trendy to say \u201cI don\u2019t like Metallica\u201d and things like \u201cif you\u2019re a genuine metalhead, you\u2019re only allowed to listen to Metallica until \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d. Bullshit. That\u2019s just a deceptive argument to say \u201cHey! I know what heavy metal is and you don\u2019t know shit! They don\u2019t sound like heavy anymore. They shouldn\u2019t have innovated\u201d. These are the same guys who say that Slayer or Cathedral is bad just because it\u2019s \u201calways the same\u201d. Feel free to say you hate Metallica and this album, but stop trying to change others\u2019 minds. I bet most of you have jumped with \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d and headbanged with \u201cSad But True\u201d. I was 11 years old when I heard \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d for the first time and it was enough to set me into heavy tones: first \u201cMetallica\u201d, shortly \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d, \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d, Pantera, Iron Maiden and so on\u2026 \n\nThis is only my opinion:\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know why so many people find this album Metallishit number one; we are in front of a monster which committed a \u201ccrime\u201d by exposing heavy music to the world and in spite of whatever you think, I feel it\u2019s a thing good that heavy metal didn\u2019t remain always underground. The \u201cMetallica\u201d album is not the traditional thrash bay area sound, alright, but it\u2019s still heavy metal with remarkable solos, as well as massive and catchy riffs and, most of all, songs that make us feel good and became, nowadays, true classics. It is the work that allowed Metallica to step into the rank of those bands (and I\u2019m not talking about metal bands exclusively) who have nothing to prove to anyone and culminates a meteoric progress that probably any metal band ever had (let\u2019s see if Mastodon can do it\u2026).\n\nAt a first listening, you can easily catch some impressions about the whole album such as James \u201cmaster of the riffs\u201d Hetfield: the legendary one from \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d or heavy ones like \u201cSad But True\u201d (somehow recovered in \u201cSome Kind of Monster\u201d) and \u201cOf Wolf and Man\u201d. James shows also a fine vocal display that I would define as transition vocals, very well supported by the finest production ever, though. Lars shows us decent drums. He may not be the most talented drummer, I must admit, but what he lacks in technique is left behind by a firm pulse which never lets the music down (a little bit like that Dave McClain from Machine Head acquired through the years). Lars has interesting peaks in this album that I would recommend like \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d, \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d and \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d; Kirk\u2019s performance is amazing, once he gets, in this album, many of the best solos heard during Metallica\u2019s career. To finish, I\u2019d like to enhance a detail you may not notice, but I think it was a great choice to put the songs in that order. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t like the fact that too many songs fade out at the end.\n\nTalking about the \u201celements\u201d, talking about the music, this album is a tour de force (kill me). Metallica derives from an impure bay area sound (they\u2019ve always been one step ahead for the fans or one step behind for the haters of the band) into a sophisticated and catchy heavy metal. I feel the anger is still there, but somehow refined. It is a landmark for all the reasons: as I said before, the classics that still remain, the millions sold (either if it\u2019s a good or a bad sign), the tour\u2026 I would call it a drastic paradigm shift, I guess. If they had the will or the art to make it like Iron Maiden, people would noticed and admired it; the whole Maiden career is a paradigm shift (a very good one); instead, Metallica\u2019s life is fragmented and maybe they didn\u2019t have the ability to deal with a good management of their sound as time went by, but who knows, maybe they didn\u2019t care for it?\n\nI never wanted this to be a boring song by song review, but let me detach a few moments that still send \u201cthe shivers up and down my spine\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d is not a ballad or a sweet kind of song. This is a doomy dragged masterpiece. It starts off with an addicting intro with a great acoustic support by Hetfield. Then he strikes with some hard chords and the way he sings is awesome! The chorus is mellow but always conveying a sad tone. When the main body of the song stops, it\u2019s time to hear one of the most outstanding solos I know from Kirk. And it hauls to the end in the same melodic sad mood. \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d is huge! One of my favourite ever. The heavy punishing atmosphere they create is almost unique. Kirk\u2019s solo is faultless, then it stops, the rhythm beats you again and Kirk comes back. After the little pause (when you hear a distant \u201chey!\u201d) the song ends in the best possible way (just listen to the last 20 seconds).\n\nTalking again about details (but in life is all about details, right?), you can catch, here and there, a glimpse of the finest stuff heavy metal has to offer, like the way they worked the overlapping of guitars and vocals in \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d (the \u201cand my ties are severed clean\u2026\u201d;\u201danywhere I roam\u2026\u201d part) or the technique they chose in combining guitars the way they did after a hypnotizing soft part in \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d.\n\nThe boys took a great shot here. Just let this all flow. But hey\u2026it\u2019s only my opinion!\n",
        "\nThis right here is what metal is all about, and what Cliff was all about, basically the same thing. Be yourself and have fun. Which are two things that I accomplished having watched this.\n\nCliff 'em All.....wow, one hell of a video! This right here is Metallica in their simplest and most kickass form. Containing live videos of songs throughout the first three albums, this DVD is nothing but thrash. All the shows on here are played with such youthful energy which truly made Metallica....Metallica! The live performances have such a vibe going between the band and the crowd that it almost made me feel as if I was there too! For the brief hour and a half that is on this video, you can forget about everything with the new Metallica and just indulge yourself in headbanging fun.\n\nThe songs that are played live on here are some of my favorite from all three of the albums with three songs from MoP and RtL and 5 songs from KeA. They even manage to scrap together an encore performance of a cover song, Am I Evil? All in all, the live performances are simply amazing, they display Metallica's ability to capture the crowd in a trance like state and not let go untill the final note has been hit. It's almost wierd though to watch some of the earlier performances from 1983 and 1984 because there is absolutely NO moshing of any sort, and there's only like one or two kids with the devil horns up! They all have their fists or they hands up instead of the devil horns. I don't know but to me it just brought an eerie feeling since any metal gig you go to today would have pits and devilhorns everywhere. But one thing that was prominent between the band and the crowd was headbanging, and damn Metallica does alot of it!\n\nAlong with the footage of the live performances, there's also interviews, montages, and just some home footage of the band hanging out and getting drunk. The opening scene has Metallica walk into a store, take beer, and just leave(simply badass). There's also a good 10 or 15 more mintues of the band drunk and talking about how they should call in a state of emergency because they have no more beer. Or when a guy in the crowd takes Kirks guitar and a fight breaks out to get it back to the stage! One thing that I saw that also surprised me was an interview of Metallica back in March of 1983 when Dave Mustaine was still in the band. And you can't really go back any further into Metallica history than that! \n\nBut this video was really ment to commemorate the good times that were had with Cliff. In one of the interviews Cliff states, \"You know we're just being ourselves, doing what we want to do. Some people think that we're selling out because we're on a major label and that we're popular, but fuck those people. Even if we weren't on a major label we'd still be doing the same things.\" Cliff fit Metallica perfectly. He just had the attitude and the persona that would be defined as \"metal.\" And Cliff was definitely a major input to the band with helping to write around a dozen songs. Not to mention that he was also nasty on the bass with a bunch of insane bass solos that fill this DVD.\n\nThe quality isn't top line shit, but it also isn't that bad. It suits Metallica damn well actually. A bit fuzzy, but it still captures the feeling of Metallica.\n\nSo basically this was the young Metallica, the guys who had so much enthusiasm and energy, the guys who wore tight leather pants and bell bottoms, who wore bullet belts, who drank so much beer, the Metallica that everybody loved. But hell getting old is part of nature, there's nothing that we can do to stop that. Sometimes a life is taken too short but the best thing that we can do is capture the golden times of when everything was well and happy, either on tape or in memory, and to just fill the rest of the world in on what it was like back in the good 'ole days.\n\nR.I.P Cliff Burton \\m/\n",
        "\nI once had a friend who I used to debate music with a lot. I'm older and (I like to think) wiser now, and I rarely do this now as I think music is a subjective thing - you either like it or you don't. But he said something which, to this day, I still can't get my head around: he actually criticised bands like Metallica for being \"too precise\". Not \"too shreddy\", which I would have understood completely, but \"too precise\". Apparently it was a bad thing to play a song with too much skill as doing so automatically detracted from the quality of the songwriting. It seems to me that he must have had something to do with St Anger as it was his flawed philosophy that ruined the whole album.\n\nThe Black Album was, for me, Metallica's last great album. Although my favourite album is Master of Puppets, the Black Album was in my opinion better on the whole than ...And Justice For All. I say this as a guy who loves thrash metal but doesn't listen to it exclusively, therefore to me the Black Album was still good despite the change in direction. However, it was certainly ominous, and Load and Reload were pretty boring affairs from a band that had cut their hair and grown out of heavy metal, but even these albums had a few excellent tracks - they were just inconsistent. I really love The Memory Remains, Fuel and The Unforgiven II. Still, Metallifans still longed to see Metallica grow their hair, drink a bit more, pump some iron down the gym and get back in shape for a spectacular return to form as true titans of heavy metal.\n\nOh how wrong we were. It all sounded so promising, didn't it; \"Metallica are going back to their roots\" and \"the new album is raw and heavy\" dominated the news articles we read about the album in magazines. Then it came out and we were sorely disappointed.\n\nI don't particularly care about the poor production, the apparent the use of Pro Tools or the fact that Lars' snare drum sounded ridiculous; Kill 'Em All had awful tinny production but I love it all the same because the sheer quality of the songs shines through. I'm also not especially bothered about the absence of guitar solos - I like Kirk Hammett's lead work but I had already heard that there were no solos and I made a conscious effort to listen to this album with an open mind; besides, I listen to plenty of bands that incorporate little or no soloing and still manage to sound great. No, the problem with this album was the lack of any really decent songwriting or musicianship to speak of.\n\nYou see, this is what happens when you take the doctrine of simplicity, as espoused by punk and some grunge bands, too far. I rarely listen to punk because I find its strict prohibition on anything remotely complex or technically demanding counterproductive; rather than making the songs sound more raw and exciting - or raising the quality of the songwriting as my friend asserts - the musicians in the band are so restricted in what they can do in songs that they become boring to listen to for more than one or two songs. This is what seems to have happened here. Metallica falsely assumed that they could reinject aggression and passion into their music simply by swearing and forgetting how to play their instruments. Many bands manage to make their songs sound interesting without solos but Metallica didn't manage this on St Anger, and as a result the album is an extremely monotonous affair that you just get bored of very quickly. There are a couple of decent riffs here and there but that's about it. I really wanted to like this album and I listened to it again and again but it really is unadulterated cack. Bands like Slayer, Pantera, and even Metallica on their older material have consistently dispelled the myth that skillful musicianship and raw, heavy songs are not mutually exclusive.\n\nI love Metallica for their awesome live show and the strength of their older material; if we judged them purely on the classics then I'd consider them one of the best - if not the very best - metal bands ever. As it stands though we have to accept that, in a career spanning over 20 years, Metallica were bound to run out of steam sooner or later, and to be fair this happened long before St Anger. I just don't think they're into what we would call \"proper heavy metal\" anymore and as such they're not going to put their hearts and souls into that kind of album. For this reason I'm not overly hopeful about the new album because it sounds to me like they're just trying to reclaim credibility after the negative response to St Anger, but on the other hand, Lars did say that they were getting back into thrash after having played a mostly old-skool set of late, so we'll see. Maybe the knackered old heavyweight can make a comeback after all.\n",
        "\nWell here you have it, all the Metallica videos on one DVD. Your probably wondering why the hell you should get this DVD when you can see everyone of their videos on youtube for free. Well I wanted this DVD because Metallica is my favorite band, and I could have all the video's on one disc and watch them anytime I choose to do so.\n\n\nThe pro's and cons of the DVD. Well the main pro is all the music videos are on one DVD and you can access them easily. However a con is most the videos are from the Load era to St. Anger era of Metallica which are Metallica's weakest albums. The best videos are the earliest ones including \"One, Enter Sandman, Sad but True, and Where ever I may roam\" Some of the weaker ones are \"Hero of the day, Until it Sleeps, and Mama Said\" which is a sad sight for the once great metal band. Another bonus of the DVD is the bonus features, however their nothing to write home about, There is The Unforgiven (Theatrical Version) which is kinda drawn out and boring. There is also a jammin version of 'One\" which is alright, and a nice introduction about the video for \"One\" by Lars Ulrich himself which gives you some insight on the video. Lastly there is a trailer for the \"Some Kind of Monster DVD\" which in reality is just an advertisement to make you buy that DVD, and shouldn't even be mentioned as a bonus.\n\nOverall its a very basic DVD with all the Metallica music videos released thus far and should satisfy any die hard Metallica fan.\n",
        "\nI'm not one to tell you Metallica has 'sold out' and become a bad band. I can appreciate all of their stuff, and mostly, I can joyfully listen to it. That said, I understand what St. Anger is about. Having watched Metallica's 2004 documentary \"Some Kind of Monster\" several times, I can totally understand and appreciate the album for all it is. The problem is, as much as I respect the album and everything the band has gone through to put it out, that doesn't redeem the album. St. Anger is an uninspired, annoying and ultimately disappointing record from a group of successful, artistic musicians.\n\nSpeaking of what led to this album is useless since you can write books about that long, painful process, but you can sum it up in a nutshell. The band, on the verge of splitting up, decides to take the couch and hire a psychotherapist to help them confront their problems, within themselves and with each other. Part of the process was to let everyone contribute whatever they wanted and ending up using every suggestion that came up. Needless to say, that's a pretty bad idea. Take the best musicians in the world, and they'll come up with some bad ideas that won't make the final cut. And that's the problem. Every riff, every drumbeat, every lyric was used, and the result sounds like a miscalculated mess.\n\nSt. Anger is more metal-oriented and way faster than Load and Reload, and indeed, the album is intense. It might be a good stress reliever, but even if that's what you're looking for, there's a ton of other stuff you could try. From the very first noted of opener \"Frantic\", it's apparent that St. Anger is nasty-sounding. The guitar tone is low and the bass is barely audible, but one thing that is completely unforgivable is the abysmal drum sound. Lars Ulrich has never the most impressive drummer on the earth, but his uninspired, terrible-sounding drumming on St. Anger is beyond nauseating. \n\nThe titular St. Anger does seem to display some good ideas. \"I feel the world shake, like an earthquake, it's hard to see clear, is it me, is it fear?\" sings Hetfield in one of the album's only good moments. Unfortunately, the riffs are mediocre and the lyrics and melodies passable at best.\n\nUnfortunately St. Anger's one bright spot is a rare case throughout the album. The album continues beyond this song to bland, overlong songs that incorporate mostly forgettable riffs and weird, sometimes downright-illogical lyrics. On top of that, there are no guitar solos whatsoever, and the entire album just reeks of copy-paste patterns. Some would blame the use of ProTools. I'd say it's complete lack of inspiration.\n\nOther than the chorus from St. Anger, other parts of the album also tend to pull their head up and save the album from being a total coaster. There's the occasional nice riff or cool melody. The main riff on Some Kind of Monster is pretty damn heavy, and there are some cool moments in that song. Sadly, the song carries on for over eight minutes, overstaying its welcome by quite a bit. \n\nThere are two songs on the album that I'd consider decent, even good songs. First in line is Dirty Window. The song isn't too long, and it's pretty fun to listen to. The clean chorus is quite enjoyable and the whole song has a kind of groove to it. Second up is the downbeat The Unnamed Feeling. This is the best song on the album, though it does have Hetfield's most embarrassing vocal moment, with him switching between his dirty, aggressive sound and a squeak that would put Steven Wilson to shame. Speaking of vocals, Hetfield's performance on St. Anger is really uneven. At times he sounds good, other times he's very disappointing.\n\nThat said, these two songs don't save the album from songs like \"Invisible Kid\" or \"Purify\". Totally-weird lyrics, bad riffs and complete lack of interest are the name of the game on St. Anger, and these two songs are the best example of it.\n\nSo yes, St. Anger does indeed contain a few good ideas. In fact, had the band kept all the lyric-writing up to James and put a better screening process on all the ideas offered by different band members, then maybe those moments could have been made into truly great songs. As they are, almost all of the songs on St. Anger are repetitive, overly long and boring to listen to. St. Anger is most definitely Metallica's weakest effort, and one of the most disappointing albums of all time.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve often wondered what the best way to measure the level that a particular album flops. Is it the lack of rave reviews, the bottoming out of sales after a brief run at the top (which can only occur with an established act, such as this one, in which case initial sales are based completely on anticipation) or perhaps the seeming discontent among the fan base? Although there would be a strong case to make that these all would rank at the top, my own anecdotal experience of how I came into possession of this troubled release takes the cake.\n\nI had been giving guitar lessons at a store in my old home town in 2004 when a new student came in asking to learn some metal. When I asked what he was interested in, he basically stated \u201cAnything but Metallica!\u201d At first I was chuckled at the statement because I had seen the band as a joke in the aftermath of the Load/Reload debacles, let alone the classic soap opera that was the \u201cSome Kind of Monster\u201d documentary. However, about a month later he ended up donating some of his Metallica memorabilia to me; including some t-shirts, a poster from the Black Album era, and this single which none of his friends wanted. \n\nI\u2019ve come to see the fact that this low in Metallica\u2019s story is underscored by the massive plummet in the resale value of all music associated with it. Not only that, but people actually swearing off the band and just giving away stuff from their better days, without any thought of the $10 or so thrown away in the process. And I am pretty sure that my own example was but one of a rather large amount, not all of which were older fans.\n\nBasically this single is worth what I paid for it, not a damn thing. It is truly sad when you have 3 or 4 half assed remakes of Ramones songs (which any 12 year old can handle) as the highlight of a so-called release by a so-called metal band. James Hetfield\u2019s voice has become so much a ghost of it\u2019s former self that he can\u2019t even put an inch of attitude into songs written for a singer with a 4 or 5 note range. Between the tinny high snare drum sound, the overloud cymbals, and the drastically bass ridden kick drum there is no middle to speak of in the drums, which was not the case with the original versions of these songs, which were recorded more than 2 decades before this was. The guitar tone is all mud and zero crunch; although not unheard of on certain grunge albums, it definitely clashes heavily with the punk genre.\n\nAlthough the production of the edited version of this single seems a bit tweaked and a lot of the needless repetition has been taken out, \u201cSt. Anger\u201d is still a flamboyant turd sandwich with zero meat. If you listen closely you can literally hear the diarrhea-like mustard of the cuisine perspiring from the strings of the down tuned guitars as they puke out half-assed emo-core riffs and occasional stops and starts. The tinny drums provide such a concentrated and revolting zing to the flavor that the stomach bug carrying victim who produced the mustard probably mixed the mustard seeds with wasabi sauce. Hetfield\u2019s vocals are the soggy, rotten lettuce that is slightly more powerful than the zing of the drums with its putrid stench. And the moldy bread that holds this cesspool of noise together is the follow-the-guitar bass line provided by Bob Rock. And for you music video enthusiasts out there, we have a nice little side of rat urine drenched potato ends that appear in the form of 4 guys dressed in rap/rock apparel trying to look tough by playing to an audience of prison inmates.\n\nThe thought that anyone in metal circles can defend this pile of garbage is beyond my comprehension, let alone the idea that someone would assert that this would be a hot topic for any stretch of time in the positive sense. The summer after the LP was released it sold 2 million copies, most of the buyers probably either kids too young to remember the pre-Black Album era or old time Metalicultists who would follow James and Lars into a goat\u2019s scrotum before criticizing their work. In the end, it seems that reasoning minds have prevailed and no one is ashamed to say that the Emperor has no clothes. Thank God!\n",
        "\nAs mentioned in my 'I Disappear' review, I recently stumbled upon a large amount of old tapes and singles from my very early high school days. Back then I was a huge Met fan (along with enjoying a lot of Nu-Metal), but not really having the money and/or financial discipline required to buy full lengths, I mostly bought singles. This single was the first proper piece of music I ever brought, and it still holds a special place in my heart, as it was the live version of 'The Prince' (I got Part.1 of this single) that really switched me on to to that aggressive style of music we call 'heavy metal'. \n\nIndeed, The Prince is still one of my favourite Metallica songs. It's fast, it's got some great riffs and solos and back when I was 12 years old, well, James singing \"And I will burn in He-ellll, from the day I diiieeeee-ah\" just sounded REALLY EVIL. The good ol' twin guitar interlude in this song is pretty excellent, and while it's not exactly at a brutal death metal level of heaviness, it was freaking heavy back in the day and I still get a big kick out. Still, it's not all nostalgia that gives me a liking for this song. Sure, I know it's a cover, but it's still fast, aggressive and super catchy.\n\nOf course, The Prince isn't actually the main song on this single, which is unfortunate. However, the other two tunes aren't completely balls either. Personally, I would've preferred Am I Evil over Blitzkrieg, but Blitzkrieg is still a pretty epic tune. The main riff is totally epic, and while it loses a bit in the bridge, it's another pretty sweet tune. Covers like this are a real reminder that Metallica borrowed a huge amount off NWOBHM- a lot of RTL sounds like this song. Well, at least I think it does. A sweet thrashy tune, regardless.\n\nAnd then we're down to the worst song on the album. Whiskey in the Jar is hated by most people, which is probably fair enough. I have no idea what the Thin Lizzy version sounded like, but this is the kind of stuff most metalheads love to hate- a good times, hard rock/metal hybrid that sounds almost like AC/DC with heavier production and a much less annoying vocalist. Still, despite it's shallowness, it is, well, a good times, hard rock/metal hybrid. Don't listen to it with headphones in a dark room, because it will suck- but playing this tune at a party will work quite well. As mentioned by the other reviewer, the solos are indeed a bit sloppy, but that just increases the charm of this song- it's probably the first official song Metallica have ever done that could be classified as 'raw' (..excluding St.Anger, I guess.). Was it churned out in 30 seconds by Metallica when they were totally hammered? Most likely. But, I like it anyway, so there.\n\nTo conclude then, I love this single. I think the love is basically pure nostalgia, but while most people will be extremely by Whiskey in the Jar, I still think it's an enjoyable tune, the other two songs are great, and 'The Prince' got me into true, heavy metal so this will always have a special place in my heart.\n",
        "\nRecently, after finding a few unpacked boxes from my last house move, I discovered a lot of old tapes of mine, which friends had recorded for me when I was in year 8 (we had quite the tape trading underground at our school!). It consisted mostly of the usual year 8 in 1999 fare- some Limp Bizkit, some Korn, and a few played to death Metallica albums. Being somewhat short of money back then, I had a tendency to buy singles instead of full lengths. This was one of those singles, and I'd totally played this death. So, upon discovery, I gave this a couple of listens, basically expecting I'd hate it.\n\nBut you know what, this song really isn't too bad. In terms of creativity and integrity, then this would easily be Metallica's nadir. However, it's also a very entertaining single, and to say anything less does Metallica a disservice. \n\nYep, this is so catchy and commercial that it makes The Black Album sound like a Under a Funeral Moon in comparison. The guitar riffs are incredibly easy, basically consisting of two chords, the lyrics are extremely simple and totally scream 'sing along', and everything else, from the guitar solo to the straight forward drums is extremely accessible, melodic, and easy to get into. It's some extremely simple hard rock/metal stuff that's really catchy and great to sing along too while drunk.\n\nBasically, then, this song succeeds. What most people seem to forget is that this song was written for a soundtrack to an (extremely bad) action movie. It's not meant to be a freaking 9 minute long prog epic! It's meant to be something that will go over well when the producers play it on closing credits. And that it is.\n\nTo conclude then, I would say: Yes, this is an extremely poppy, simplistic hard rock/metal song- which is both a pro and a con. This doesn't have the integrity of AJFA, Load, or even St.Anger, and while it is a bit of a cash grab, it's still a good bit of party music. Don't expect anything else from this and you won't be disappointed.\n\nOn a final note, the video of this song is extremely entertaining, and it's the video that made me want to play guitar. I'm adding another 10% to the rating purely because the video was so good.\n",
        "\nCalifornia's Metallica, possibly the biggest name in the metal world, is a band of progression. Many will denote the passing of Cliff Burton as the band's untimely death, and the albums that follow this tragic event as the mere shadow of a once-great band. I will make no such denotes. To me, a band that explores its creative juices is a truly artistic band, for a true artist does not fear the idea of trying different things.\n\nThis effort, oddly named ...and Justice for All, is a true sign that Metallica are a bunch of truly expressive artists. There is a certain charm to the album's bare-bones, dry, raw production and its technical structures, but there's also a lot of expressive anger, discontent and even emotion in here. It may not have Cliff Burton written on its \"Metallica is\", but it doesn't have to - ...and Justice for All is arguably Metallica's greatest metal record.\n\n...and Justice for All is a very ballsy album. Speaking of defiance of social ideas, greed and war, Justice can be justifiably called a rebellious record. In fact, it's probably the band's most rebellious release yet, using a heavier sound and a much more aggressive approach to the music.\n\nTake \"Eye of the Beholder\" for example. This completely emotionless song speaks of freedom of speech and the way it is mutilated by authorities, governments and the likes. The band's frustration shines through this one in its crushing riffs and difficult melodies. The lyrics don't stop there. Even the apocalyptic \"Blackened\" describes the end of the world and doesn't waste its time making a hint. \n\n\"Fire\nTo begin whipping dance of the dead\nBlackened is the end\nTo begin whipping dance of the dead\nFire\nis the outcome of hypocrisy\nDarkest potency \nIn the exit of humanity\nColor our world blackened\".\n\nMetallica's discontent with society is possibly most apparent on the titular song, which happens to last for almost 10 minutes. The song, surprisingly melodic for such an angry tune, speaks of the power that money has over people and the corruption that it causes.\n\n..but Justice touches on more than just corruption and social deformities. The band's anthem, \"One\", is the band's most well-known ballad, taking influences from the book and movie \"Johnny Got His Gun\". The song, just like \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" before it, keeps shifting between the soft and melodic and the crunchy and heavy, creating a very dynamic song that only keeps building up until it finally explodes into complete chaos, incorporating what is probably Kirk Hammett's best guitar solo ever and the band's famous machinegun riff.\n\nIf that's not enough, then for the first time since \"Fade to Black\", James Hetfield decides to show his darker, more personal side, this time through the thrashy Dyers Eve. Just like the violent burst of an emotional breakdown, Hetfield assaults his parents for not doing the best job raising him. \n\n\"Dear mother, dear father\nYou've clipped my wings before I learned to fly\nUnspoiled, unspoken\nI've outgrown that fuckin' lullaby\nSame thing I've always heard from you\nDo as I say not as I do\"\n\nHetfield's powerful lyrics are full of light metaphors and direct attacks at different things, and they remain great throughout the entire album. It's amazing how some of these topics remain relevant to this very day, making Justice quite a relevant record, even almost 20 years after its release.\n\nAnd the music, well, is excellent. As stated above, this is Metallica at its rawest, most aggressive, most technical. The bass is barely audible, the guitars are thick and the drums make a clicking sound, and all this can and will turn some off, but here's a person who thinks the dry production serves the album well. The pure raw anger is complimented by the raw production, and overall the sound of the album isn't half as bad as some make it out to be.\n\nJustice contains Metallica's most sophisticated, heaviest riffs yet. A lot of changing tempos, a lot of weird rhythms, a lot of palm-muted guitars and a lot of excellent solos courtesy of one Kirk Hammett, specifically One, Blackened and Dyers Eve. What's interesting about Justice is how most of its solos are actually divided in two, with a small break in between. A pure example of that is opener Blackened. The solo comes in after an impressive guitar harmony and at first, it's pretty measured. The riff in the background isn't the thrashy riff that's so characteristic of the song but a very heavy one, and the solo builds on it very well, only getting faster and faster until finally making a screeching halt, giving way to Hetfield's powerful rhythm guitar to show its face one more time before Hammett finally goes berserk and bombards us with perfectly placed, lightning-fast notes backed by fast riffing and drumming, eventually throwing the song's trademark riff right back at your face for the final blow. Justice is filled to the top with moments like this of songs building up, just like a hammer being swung backwards before it's flung forward to crush the rock below it. The drumming in Justice is also very good and definitely showcases Lars Ulrich's best, most inspired work, specifically on the title song.\n\nThis isn't to say the music on Justice is perfect. The technical nature of the album and the long songs might drag on a bit at times, and the album seems to be losing momentum on \"The Shortest Straw\" and \"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\". Do not get me wrong, these are two excellent songs, but sometimes they feel a bit overlong when you give the album a full listen. This is all forgiven by the song bridging them, \"Harvester of Sorrow\", which is quite possibly the band's heaviest song right next to \"The Thing That Should Not Be\".\n\nJustice also includes an instrumental piece called \"To Live is to Die\". This instrumental, unlike the mysterious \"Orion\", is very sad and desperate, though it does have a very similar structure. Heavy guitars, a solo, a soft bridge and finally back to the heavy for one more moment of power and a fade-out ending. Worthy of special mention is the melodic section in the middle of the song. This depressing riff is divine on its own, but when it gets the company of James and Kirk's guitars it becomes the most powerful moment on the album. The ending of the instrumental, based around a poem written by the late Cliff Burton, only gives the piece more power and keeps making me feel bad that it actually ends.\n\n\"When a man lies\nHe murders some part of the world\nThese are the pale deaths\nWhich men miscall their lives\nAll this I cannot bear to witness any longer\nCannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?\"\n\n...And Justice for All is a difficult album. It's not easy to listen to, it's not easy to digest and it's definitely not easy for people used to lighter stuff. Its production is controversial, its lyrical themes aren't very optimistic and the entire sound of the album is just very dark and angry. However, as dark and heavy as it is, Justice is still a very melodic, musically fascinating album that not only can be considered the band's creative peak, but one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time. Metallica was great before ...And Justice for All and they were just as great after it, but if you ask me, it'd be hard for them to top this masterpiece.\n",
        "\nSt. Anger, Metallica's worst misstep to the date, has been a controversial album ever since its release, and perhaps even before. The awful drum sound, the overall intentionally bad production, lousy songwriting, and the ridiculous Some Kind of Monster \"documentary\" surrounding it have all influenced the opinion of metalheads, and even die-hard Metallica fans have been perplexed by the strange transformation of the band. The future will show what happens next, but so far, Metallica's career has been as cross-genre spanning as a used car salesman's lot next to a highway.\n\nKill 'Em All, with its juvenile drive and ambition resembled an old battered Mustang, painstakingly tuned by a zit-faced but amazingly skilled amateur mechanic, with a clumsy flame paint and a set of black furry dice. Ride the Lightning was a newer version of the same, but with professional polished paint job and semi-expensive low profile tires. Master of Puppets witnessed the conversion to a black '68 Corvette, and Justice for All became a brand new ZR-1, but unfortunately driven by a sales manager in his 40's, with money to buy one but lacking the balls to really burn rubber while doing donuts and incapable of testing any outer limits of the vehicle.\n\nAfter Justice, the long slide down began. The Black Album turned out to be a hypothetical sports car manufactured by Oldsmobile for oxymoronic rebellious lawyers, and Load was a brand new Chrysler Voyager. Voyagers are so convenient for family guys with severely limited testosterone levels and a family to feed and transport, but to be fair, they even might have a handy CD changer and air conditioning. Reload was the same, but seven years old, and with the lousy 2.4 liter inline engine intended solely for the European market; why pay for a new car, when an old one will take you places just the same? And the story meets its end with St Anger, the rusty old '88 Jeep Wrangler, bought in the throes of a serious midlife crisis, just for the memory of the old spirit of rebellion that essentially amounts to a few deliberate rust spots, a Confederate flag sticker and a permanently empty gun rack.\n\nYes, the often-repeated opinion that St Anger is a product of a band suffering from a crisis is indeed a fact. But the crisis itself had nothing to do with the band's internal chemistry or the difficulty of creation; at least those are not the main issues, but more like symptoms of the real problem. It was all about a midlife crisis, both on the personal level of the band members, and on the whole band's level. The well had run dry, there was more than enough money for everybody, and the Loads had already labelled the band as almost-AOR. Everything had been done, there was nothing more to give. And yet, a strange yearning for the old days made the band enter the studio once more. In other words, it was time to go shopping for a car, and the longing for the old days made them choose a clunker. Had Metallica been a traditional rock dinosaur, they would have looked for an ancient Volkswagen Kleinbus to paint flowers on. But they were Metallica, the thrash band of all thrash bands, and they needed some roughness. Thus, an old Wrangler from the 80's.\n\nThere is no Wrangler engine block churning under the hood of the rusty clunker, however. Metallica's days of thrash are over, and while they tried, sweating, crying and cursing, the result is not a return to the roots. There's no furious, beer-fueled off-roading here, none of the kind a rusty Jeep suggests. While the vehicle may be mercilessly ugly and intended as a display of rude rage to a casual observer, it is still driven with the methodology of a family man behind the wheel of the trusty old Voyager. That is the great misunderstanding Metallica is guilty of: distorition, fast bonkbonkbonketybonking on a set of trash cans, and unpolished production do not equal the quality or thrashiness of Ride the Lightning.\n\nTo elaborate the point, think about the better - or rather, the less sucky - tracks on this sorry excuse for a thrash album. Take Sweet Amber as an example. Now, spend some time on the following mental excercise: try your damnest to imagine the song with the kind of performance and production it would have had on Load or Reload. Clean it of the clutter and intentional curbs in your mind, polish it with the soundboard in you brain, and you'll have a track off Reload in no time.  That  is the fundamental problem on the album: while trying to manufacture a metal album, Metallica forgot to throw away the jigs they had left scattered around in the workshop, and, from the songwriting angle, they accidentally welded together a crude Re-reload instead, simply bypassing the sandblasting and skipping the final layers of paint. With a few exceptions, the songs could be re-recorded with less artificial anger and polished, and they would be impossible to tell apart from those on the Loads.\n\nThe result is truly as sorry as the average opinions around seem to suggest. Honestly. The songs, not thrash in their essence, do not work as thrash songs, and the mellow beer-gutted rebellion is sadly confined to the bad production and pseudo-furious playing, glued articifially on top of the rock songs underneath. The credibility is on par with that of Blues Brothers 2000.\n\nThe unavoidable conclusion here is pretty simple and bleak: Metallica lost the control, attempted too much, with the wrong methods, after too long a break, and tried to return to the work they had spent a decade actively forgetting. Using a sledgehammer and several abrasive tools to force rock songs into a thrash mould, they created a Some Kind of Monster, but unfortunately, a monster of the oldest Hammer Films kind; ugly, but more content to hide in the shadows, weeping and grieving its sorry fate, rather than anything really scary.\n\nIf you have seen the \"documentary\", Some Kind of Monster, you have perhaps had the same thoughts as so many others: if making an album is so difficult, there's no real ambition to do that, and the band needs a shrink to get their asses into the studio in the first place, and so forth, why not forget the whole thing? Why not let the band die with some shreds of its dignity left, or settle for playing their old music as a stadion dinosaur? St. Anger amounts to a oddity rarely seen before, premature auto-necrophilia. Unless they can come up with something brilliant on their possible future album, this will be an embarrassing tombstone of a once great outfit. But there's no returning to Ride the Lightning; just buying an old Wrangler doesn't turn a middle-aged man into a young, eager and credible metal maniac. No, it just makes the listener blush, just like seeing an old, balding saggy geezer in a brand new biker leather jacket stopping to refuel a factory-fresh Harley Davidson. It would be better to do something else instead, and let the old days remain in the fond memories.\n",
        "\nThis album garners a lot of hate, much of it undeserved. It's not amazing, it's not Metallica's best, and there are ways to have a go at it. But it's a solid offering, and I can well believe a lot of criticism thrown at it is simply \"going with the flow\". While it could be a lot better, it could be a lot worse too, and ultimately what we have here is an interesting experiment, even if not always the best sounding one.\n\nFirst and foremost, it has balls. Metallica have always been, and always will be, one of the greatest bands of all time because they have no fear of taking risks and doing what they want. They don't make music to cater for any particular group, they make music because they want to, and a great big middle finger to anyone who doesn't like that. St. Anger is most definitely not commercial, no one can say they're trying to make money with it (if Metallica release something that sells well it seems they did it for money, if not this argument is conveniently forgotten). Nor are they trying and failing to re-kindle their old sound, which could also be open to criticism. Instead, they are doing what they have always done, which is to play what they want, and challenging themselves with new styles and directions.\n\nIt's also worth nothing that this album can claim to be something only a very few other metal albums can: original. It is something new, something that hasn't been tried before. Yes, it is metal, that much in undeniable, and it's something I have never heard from any other band before. If I had to catagorise it as any one genre, there are elements of sludge, heavy metal, thrash, groove, hard rock, and other eclectic lesser influences. To try something new out in itself deserves some praise for the guts required and the lack of precedents to draw upon, and here it works well too. Of course, originality alone doesn't always make something good, but it does take some time to digest.\n\nNow, on to the music itself: it's angry, it's raw, it's mad at you and the world, that's pretty much it in a nutshell. And not in an \"I'm so oppressed, help me!\" kind of way, but in a real \"Fuck you\" way. The music is pure aggression, without relying on typical cliched methods of expressing it. It has an honesty to it's anger, something raw and pure from the heart.\n\nJames' vocals are as powerful and roaring as ever, working both in angry growls and more groove-based parts, coming across as having gained experience from both the early thrash work and the later Load era, and the lyrics bear a kind of impressionistic, detached feel, not being direct or open but instead taking a more symbolic or figurative slant. The drums and guitars are, despite what many might insist, on good form too. No aspect overpowers any other, and the riffs are powerful in both the slow and fast-paced moments. At times it actually reminds me quite distinctly of Kill 'em All. Not in it's general sound, but in the feeling of letting go and going back to basics rather than trying for something epic.\n\nFrantic and St. Anger itself had me thrashing along with the best of them, Some Kind of Monster chugs along like a modern day Eye of the Beholder. My World has some very nice lyrics to it, especially towards the end. Shoot Me Again and Sweet Amber each have a catchiness to them that has me singing along a lot, and the former also carries a certain dangerous feel to it, albeit a simple track at the core. The Unnamed Feeling is a powerful one, possibly the best on the album, with good thoughtful lyrics and such a sense of constrained power, fighting to get out. This sort of thing coming from a teenage voice trying to sound angsty wouldn't work. But from a seasoned veteran like Hetfield it really works and sounds true. Purify is perhaps the thrashiest of the lot, and it shows nicely the raw, wild power of this band just letting rip after such a long period of slower, more bluesy or rocky work. All throughout the drums are indeed particularly emphasised, but I find their style only adds to it. It might not work in other styles, but with this kind of music it works beautifully, really lending them an angry kind of power.\n\nIt's not perfect by any means though: some of the songs -are- overly long, such as Invisible Kid. There isn't a lot of variation, a point that is often missed while people hurry to yell out all the common criticisms without any thought. The sound and attitude is maintained pretty much throughout, and perhaps the biggest flaw with the album is this lack of variety. It's always been one of the band's strengths that their songs trigger different emotions and work on differing levels, keeping each album interesting throughout. St. Anger is potentially Metallica's most samey offering.\n\nAlso, while a lot of the lyrics are thoughtful and honest, they're not the best the band has come up with by a long way, and it's very apparent that the song-writing took on a more open, organic style with this album, with all the band members throwing something in. As with the whole album, an interesting experiment, but not always a successful one. Another problem is the lack of solos: I wouldn't say, as some do, that it ruins the album or anything, but we know Kirk is so good at them that it's disappointing not to see that, and they would help pad out some of the songs greatly.\n\nMetallica are not about something so simple as thrash metal, they never have been. They are about pushing boundaries and doing something new and special, and thus St. Anger fits perfectly into their catalogue in it's core meaning, just look beyond the basic aesthetics. All in all it's an good piece of work, and I don't see what all the hate is about. It's not as complex, and it is a very raw piece of work certainly, and nor is it a patch on their 80s work overall. But that by no means makes it worthless. Metallica take a big risk with this, and while the experiment still stumbles and doesn't work so well as the Load/Reload albums, it's still a worthwhile addition to their catalogue. St. Anger isn't what I expected from the band, and in a number of ways wasn't what I wanted from them, but it continues their legacy with the passion and openness I have come to expect and appreciate so much.\n",
        "\nThis is the best demo that Metallica ever released. They developed pretty much since their earlier demos. Jame's vocals improved, though he still doesn't in his definite tone. The riffing also sound much more precise and tighten and the overall sound of this recording is just easier to comprehend. There are also some new songs added since the 'Power Metal' demo and it's pretty clear that the band improved with the songwriting and discovered their own style.\n\n'Hit The Lights' explodes immediately with the drums and then the guitars comes in with a catchy riffing which sounds heavy influenced from NWOBHM, of course. The vocals are melodic and pretty high, and the soloing of Mustaine is awesome espically after the tempo break in the middle which leads to another mania of diving solos. However the version in 'Kill Em' All' sounds a bit faster, but this is still pretty fast and intensive. Very energetic opener track, one of the best thrash songs ever, I doubt that you never heard it before. 'The Mechanix' is the early form of 'The Four Horsemen'. This a faster version, with different lyrics and without the pretty essential C-Part. That makes this song sound more straightforward and uncomplicated, as opposed to the final version which sounded more \"progressive\". The riffing is topnotched, a lot of tempo breaks and variation, pretty catchy track. 'Jump In The Fire' is the same mind blowing track from 83, except for some small changes with the lead guitar and the different lyrics. 'Seek And Destroy' sounds pretty decent here, but it's a bit slower than the version of 'Kill Em' All'. The riffing sounds thrashier than anything else here, but still the NWOBHM touch is very noticeable. They omitted the last verse and I think it's better that way because it makes the song less repetitive.\n\nOverall, most of the songs here sounds the same as they will be in their debut LP. But still, here it's a different spirit. Some says it sounds livelier than 'Kill Em' All', and some says that the LP is better. I don't know, I don't care actually. This is a pretty awesome demo, and it's stand for it's own. If you looking for one of their demos, get this one because this is simply their best. But if you want the full cake get 'Kill Em' All' because it has more songs.\n",
        "\nOne thing that most metal fans are sick of is the tired, clich\u00e9d criticisms thrown at heavy metal. \u201cIt\u2019s just so Juvenile and Stupid\u201d, \u201cJust a load of bloody noise\u201d and what have you. These days, it\u2019s a claim that\u2019s somewhat easily refuted, with some of the more mainstream bands like Mastodon, Meshuggah and even Tool taking a somewhat \u2018intellectual\u2019 and literate approach to metal. However, back in 1988 there wasn\u2019t really any of this. Sure, there were plenty of bands making intelligent, interesting metal, but none of them were visible to the public. Instead, the public\u2019s perception of metal was informed by bands like Motley Crue, Poison and the like, which were, well, \u201cJuvenile and Stupid\u201d.\n\nLuckily, Metallica stepped in and begun to change things. Unlike the Hair Metallers of the time, Metallica didn\u2019t wear heaps of hair spray and make up- they looked like they had came straight from the street. And of course, you\u2019ve got the much more intelligent approach to lyric writing. Compare Motley Crue\u2019s lyrics, from their tune \u2018Girls, Girls, Girls\u2019:\n\n\u201cFriday night and I need a fight\nMy motorcycle and a switchblade knife\nHandful of grease in my hair feels right\nBut what I need to make me tight are\n\nGirls, Girls, Girls, Long legs and burgundy lips\nGirls, Dancin' down on Sunset Strip\nGirls, Red lips, fingertips.\u201d \n\nThen compare Metallica\u2019s lyrics on the title track of this album:\n\n\u201cLady Justice Has Been Raped\nTruth Assassin\nRolls of Red Tape Seal Your Lips\nNow You're Done in\nTheir Money Tips Her Scales Again\nMake Your Deal\nJust What Is Truth? I Cannot Tell\nCannot Feel\n\nThe Ultimate in Vanity\nExploiting Their Supremacy\nI Can't Believe the Things You Say\nI Can't Believe\nI Can't Believe the Price We Pay\nNothing Can Save Us\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious how big the difference is here. Metallica\u2019s lyrics aren\u2019t going to beat a Shakespeare sonnet for lyrical genius, but they aren\u2019t terrible, and compared to Motley Cure and the like, they are pretty damn good lyrics. Of course, it would be fair enough to say that Metallica weren\u2019t quite as popular as Motley Crue. They definitely didn\u2019t get as much airplay. Nonetheless, this album went to number 6 on the charts, which defines a mainstream album fairly well. A metal album, released in 1988, that sold lots and yet was still quite intelligent? That\u2019s pretty unique!\n\nOf course, just because an album is unique doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is any good. Fortunately, this album is one of the best thrash albums going. While I\u2019m not going to say \u201cEvery riff is really fierce and brutal\u201d, [i]almost[/i] every riff is brutal. Let\u2019s forget the somewhat uninspired drivel that\u2019s The Shortest Straw. The riffs in Blackened are freaking huge, and the pounding and ferocity of that song is really emphasized by the crushing, nihilistic breakdown in the middle of the song. It\u2019s definitely a reminder to everyone that sometimes slowing down the tempo can make things really heavy. Eye of The Beholder is somewhat simpler, but no less heavy, with James doing some particularly effective growls throughout this song. Meanwhile, Dyer\u2019s Eve is a surprisingly violent thrasher, full of super fast riffs and some surprisingly awkward rhythms. One takes a while to get anywhere, but when the machine gun drums and guitars come in, it\u2019s pretty enjoyable to say the least. The instrumentation in this album is really tight. Lars may get a lot of hate, but his drum patterns in this album are really solid. Kirk\u2019s soloing is at its prime- there\u2019s not a lot of wah pedal here, there\u2019s plenty of shredding, but it\u2019s still all pretty memorable. James is in good form too- his vocals were probably the most aggressive they would ever get, but they\u2019re still somewhat tuneful, and his guitar work is as solid as ever. Of course, I haven\u2019t mentioned the bass, and we\u2019ll get to that later.\n\nThere are also a few moments where Metallica stretch themselves, and do things they hadn\u2019t really done before. To Live is To Die doesn\u2019t have the most exciting riffs being mostly a slow, Sabbath like plod, but the clean break in the middle is surprisingly vulnerable, dare I say... beautiful? Hetfield\u2019s solo right after this features some of the most heartfelt guitar work in any Metallica album. Frayed Ends of Sanity has a long, extended guitar break in the middle, and it works really well. It\u2019s a surprisingly simple formula- get a riff, and play it in heaps of different keys- but it works so damn well. Harvester of Sorrow also features an extended instrumental break that\u2019s particularly impressive. These bits aren\u2019t that technical, but they aren\u2019t exactly super easy to play either, and they do feature a lot of pretty impressive interplay between the instruments. Indeed, all of the instruments (except for the bass, which I\u2019ll get to later) really shine on this album. \n\nOf course, there\u2019s a few moments where Metallica get a bit too caught up in their progressive dickery. While I enjoy the title track, it\u2019s way to freaking long, and cutting two minutes of it would be pretty sweet. As I said, a cool track, but could you imagine hearing this live? It would be so freaking boring. One is a pretty enjoyable power ballad, but like the title track it could really use some cutting. The clean riffs at the start really aren\u2019t that good, and the ending goes on for too long. Shortest Straw suffers from similar problems- generally, too many riffs that go on for too long. I\u2019m not actually sure why they put this song in here, as listening to the album shows that it\u2019s easily the weakest track on the album. If you\u2019ve got 63 minutes of material, why not just drop one track? Oh well.\n\nThe other problem with this album is the production. Yeah, most people will have heard of how crap the production is etc etc. But when you\u2019ve got material that\u2019s as good as this, it really is annoying. Admittedly, I quite like the guitar tone. It\u2019s razor sharp and fits quite well for the songs. But the lack of bass (and really, there is a complete freaking lack of bass) makes the whole album sound quite thin. It\u2019s not that noticeable when these guys are going at a fast tempo, but whenever they slow it down (eg, Harvester of Sorrow, To Live is to Die, the breakdown in Blackened) the lack of bass makes the whole thing sound quite weak. Still, compared to 99% of metal albums, it\u2019s got good production, so while someone who\u2019s new to metal may have an issue with the way it\u2019s recorded, most metal fans shouldn\u2019t have too much of a problem with it.\n\nStill, despite the flaws in the production, this is a great album, and a historically important one at that. It showed the world what metal could do, and just how damn epic and important it can be. Of course, that may not mean anything to you, and that\u2019s cool, because at the very least, this is a really entertaining thrash album.\n",
        "\nI admit that I am loth to submit another review of Master of Puppets - has everything that needs to be said already been said? - but I think, looking down at what has already been written, most of the opinions have ranged from ridiculous flaming to nostalgic reminiscence - via various comments about 'arse kickery' and whatnot - and my opinion on Metallica's greatest work lies somewhere else entirely. People have said that the riffs here aren't particularly complex, that the structures hardly break new grounds of complexity, and therefore that this is not remarkable, but I entirely disagree. I believe Master of Puppets is a superlative example of exactly how to make a genre of extreme metal intelligent, accessible, catchy, literate and focussed. No, it doesn't contain fifty billion riffs, or go at nine thousand and twenty beats per second; nor does it push the boundaries of extremity in any way. These are not the only criteria that matter, and 'Master of Puppets' proves it.\n\nThe playing and production here are perfectly synchronised to produce the maximum possible impact. The whole band - even the much maligned Lars Ulrich - stays tighter than a motherfucking gnat's arse at all times, driving the record with their locked-in thrashing. So focussed are they, that you could swear that the arms of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet were rigged up to computers. Lars pounds away, making up for what he lacks in technique with the weight he puts behind every single skin attack; he really sounds like he is smacking those drums about, and his fills crash around the listener's ears like meteorites. Cliff Burton's unconventional bass shredding lurks below the surface, twisting beneath the songs like a growling shadow of menace. Hetfield's vocals are laden with fury and force, and he gives a performance light years ahead of all his previous attempts. Everything is beautifully mixed, proffessional and slick as can be; this was a new way of recording extreme metal, a way which showed it didn't have to all be raw and raucous to be effective.\n\nSecond, the songwriting is perfect. Each riff is maintained for precisely the right time before moving on; normal cyclical song structuring is enlivened by perfectly placed riff progressions. This is not 'one riff per section' song writing, but is thought-through and purposeful complexity that remains accessible at all times - quite a feat. Every solo that Kirk Hammet busts out on this album is perfectly suited to the song which it is in, and each one is both similar enough to be clearly Kirk and different enough to be able to tell immediately which song it was from within about half a second. That's what you call class. Equally, Metallica reinforce the point that they were more than just thrashing machines, with delicate acoustic guitar interludes showcasing their sublime melodic and harmonic sensibilities - a facet of their collective personality further reinforced by the various guitar-duelling harmonies present within, which can only be described as immense. Everything is just so perfectly placed; there is nothing throwaway or slapdash at all about this album, and you can tell by listening to it.\n\nNext, the fantastic lyrics. Metal started out with thoughtful, atmospheric, unconventional and intelligent lyrics (though you wouldn't think it nowadays), and Metallica with their previous album had begun to introduce carefully crafted metaphors; metaphors that brilliantly used heavy metal cliches to introduce social commentary and philosophising without sounding out of place. Here, this experimentation reaches its apex of creativity, in an album themed entirely around various facets of control, power and its abuses; the surface themes of domination, agression and fantasy perfectly characterise the underlying meaning behind the words - drug abuse, authoritariansim, religion, unchecked corporate greed and more are explored in an unconventional and brillilant way. \n\nIf people want to hate this album, then I guess they can; they would be the only ones missing out on a truly enlightening experience. Back when I first got my ears around this, I thought all heavy metal was obsolete and useless, but 'Master of Puppets' showed me that this is not necessarily the case, and that any genre of music - no matter how maligned by idiotic music journalists - can have an artistic relevance which no other can encapsulate. Truly, 'Master of Puppets' was Metallica's masterwork, a piece of ferociously headbanging thrash which also had a brain and something to say to the world. I highly recommend it.\n",
        "\nThis for me was the last gasp of the \"true\" Metallica, the one that actually played thrash metal at one point. I remember buying this and liking it a lot at the time even though the production has a horrible tin can sound, as in it sounds as though it was recorded in a tin can. And it doesn't hold up well at all in that respect, honestly. The music, however, well...it still is pretty damn good most of the time.\n\nForget the utter lack of bottom end and tinniness for the time being, as those are obvious enough traits the moment the album starts proper. Let us also not harp on the fact that Kirk Hammett is still the weakest link with his thin, squeaky guitar tone and overly spastic vibrato technique. The riffs are still there and still strong on Hetfield's part. \n\nLars actually does a pretty decent job on here drumming-wise, I disagree with some reviewers, despite the dry and weak drum sound making him sound awful. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that Lars puts in his best performance on this album. Let us also forget how badly they fucked over Jason Newsted in the mix by taking the bass out altogether. It's a shame they removed him because he is a good player--if Flotsam & Jetsam was any indicator, mind you. The songs are good and solid in the long run; I still remember riffs from \"Blackened\" and \"Eye of the Beholder\", and even though I hate \"One\" now because it was so overplayed by (E)M(P)TV, I still think the machinegun bursts of riffing and drumming at the end are great!\n\n\"Blackened\", \"Eye of the Beholder\", \"To Live Is To Die\", \"Dyer's Eve\" (with Lars' hellacious drumming), the title track, all still resonate with me these days. Musically, this was indeed their most ambitious effort and I appreciated them taking this risk and departing from their roots just enough to make something new out of them. I found it fresh and exciting and still enjoy the hell out of this album. It's better than the damn \"Black Album\", that's for sure. \n\nIt's more progressive in that it has longer and more challenging songs on their part, different time changes and signatures, and still maintains their signature heaviness that they once had. It is a powerful balance of all the old elements of their sound mixed with newer aspects that work and work well. Now if only they'd gotten a proper production job to make this excellent music sound worthy of greater acclaim! \n\nThis still will \"bang the head that doesn't bang\" but in a different manner. A more mature and ambitious manner, and it is still heavy as hell. Shortcomings aside, of course, it still works for what it is, which is a good and exciting album.\n",
        "\nMetallica continue to keep their reputation as one of the top thrash metal of 80s, and this album is proof of that. This is just as awesome, if not, better than their debut, Kill \u2018Em All. The riffs are faster, heavier, and the overall atmosphere of this album is dark and evil. Not only that, but it also manages to have more intelligent lyrics. Metallica were certainly at their peak in 1984 with this album. A lot of the material here, as in the last album, was written by Mustaine, but he had less of an impact on this album.\n\nFight Fire With Fire starts out with a nice acoustic session which sets up the atmosphere of this album, before kicking your ass with awesome, thrashy, and fast guitar riffs. Ride The Lightning and For Whom The Bell Tolls have some pretty heavy riffs. Their both pretty catchy as well. \n\nFade To Black is, surprisingly for a thrash metal album, a ballad. Now, I\u2019m not really one for ballads, but for a ballad, this song rules! This song is pretty depressing and dark, but not in a bad way. It also has some pretty good riffs. Sure the lyrics are pretty angst driven, but there are times where I can tolerate angst driven lyrics, and this is one of those times. This is probably one of my favorite ballads, as it sets a nice dark and depressing atmosphere. The next song, \n\nTrapped Under Ice is defiantly my favorite song on this album, as well as the thrashiest on here. It reminds me of No Remorse, only more heavy and dark. It builds up, then kicks your ass with an onslaught of fast and heavy riffs and drumming along with a solo that kills. This is one of my favorite Metallica songs. Escape is much slower than the last song, but almost just as heavy. Creeping Death is another fast paced song with awesome riffs, and another awesome solo. \n\nThe Call Of Ktulu is an instrumental song. It\u2019s not my favorite instrumental song by Metallica (Orion takes the prize), but it\u2019s still an awesome song nonetheless. I think it\u2019s necessary that they closed the album off with an instrumental, especially one like this.\n\nThis is, in my opinion, Metallica\u2019s best album. It has thrashy riffs, solos that rule, and an overall dark atmosphere I na majority of the songs. This would eventually lead to Master Of Puppets which, in my opinon, is pretty overrated. If you don\u2019t have Ride The Lightning yet, then get it as soon as possible. You haven\u2019t really heard Metallica until you\u2019ve heard this album.\n\nHighlights: Fight Fire With Fire, Fade To Black, Trapped Under Ice, and Creeping Death.\n",
        "\nUp until that fateful September day, 1986 would have been a great year to be a member of Metallica. You were one of the biggest up and coming acts in the metal scene. You were spearheading the thrash metal movement in America. You had released two very well received albums, Kill Em All and Ride the Lightning. 1986 would be the year you'd release your 3rd full length album, Master of Puppets. Little did you know, Master of Puppets would become one of metal's most heralded albums of all time. Yeah, to say that they were in a good position would be an understatement. The metal world looked on to see how Metallica would handle their situation, would they pass with flying colours? Or would they crumble underneath all the pressure? Well, in short, the album was an incredible success. One of the most influential records of the genre, Master of Puppets is quite a fun album to listen to. \n\nMaster of Puppets is quite similar to Metallica's previous album, Ride the Lightning. The band again makes use of the thrash style it helped pioneer. Needless to say, the band's style is very effective. Despite the addition of melody to their thrashy formula, Metallica does not lose any of the aggression that made their older material so appealing. Songs such as Damage Inc and Battery both feature the heavy riffage that the band had carried with them from the beginning. However, the highlight of the Master of Puppets comes from tracks two and four. Both the song Master of Puppets and Welcome Home (Sanitarium) feature long melodic sections which are undoubtedly the most interesting moments of the album. These melodic interludes help change things up, particularly in the eight and a half minute long epic title track, a song driven by aggressive riffs. In a way it reminds me of Iron Maiden's epic Powerslave. Both songs start and end in a heavy manner, but effective leads and harmonies calm the aggressive moods implied by both tracks. It's quite infectious really, and easily my favourite part of the album.\n\nYeah so Ride the Lightning is my favourite Metallica album. However, saying that, there is one aspect of Master of Puppets that I prefer over its predecessor. This lies in the vocals of James Hetfield. I thought he did a good job with Ride the Lightning, especially for a thrash vocalist. But his efforts here are oh so much superior to the previous album. One song that displays this improvement is Welcome Home (Sanitarium). James' voice compliments the haunting clean guitar riff very well and invokes the pain of someone serving at an asylum. His singing is very emotional and fits the mood that the song attempts to imply. Along with the likes of Fade to Black, Ride the Lightning, and perhaps One, his efforts on Welcome Home Sanitarium may very well be the best vocal performance of his career. Battery is perhaps a better representation of what is in store for listeners when they hear Hetfield's performance on Metallica's third album. His technique has a definite aggressive edge to it, and he shines during the choruses. Aside from the son Welcome Home (Sanitarium), my favourite moment from James would be during the chorus of Disposable Heroes. His mocking of a commander ordering his soldiers to fight, kill, and die for his country has a powerful message which is depicted exceedingly well. \n\nTo this very day, Metallica's Master of Puppets is regarded as one of heavy metal's greatest all time albums. Released in 1986, one of metal's most productive years, it stands along side Iron Maiden's Somewhere in Time, Megadeth's Peace Sells\u2026But Who's Buying, Slayer's Reign in Blood, and Dark Angel's Darkness Descends as some of the years best albums, and is certainly no slouch. Tracks like Battery, Master of Puppets, and Orion have become favourites of metal fans all over the world, and have helped influence entire generations of new metal bands. Though I don't feel that Master of Puppets is Metallica's best album, it is definitely a record that every metalhead should own. Pick it up if you haven't already.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nTo many, Master of Puppets is a bona-fide classic. The quintessential Metallica album. The quintessential thrash album. The quintessential Metal album. Perhaps it is one of thrash's finest albums. But I don't quite agree. Ever since hearing both albums, I've always preferred Ride the Lightening, an album under the shadow of the mighty Master of Puppets. To me, the actual song Ride the Lightning is superior to Master of Puppets. Fade to Black is superior to Welcome Home (Sanitarium). Call of Ktulu is superior to Orion. Well, this is just my opinion anyways. Ride the Lightning was Metallica's sophomore effort. But there would be no sophomore jinx here. Recorded in 1984, the album continues to develop the band's thrashy sound farther. \n\nAs I just mentioned, with Ride the Lightning, Metallica employs a very convincing thrash metal sound. The heavy riffs found in songs like the title track and Trapped Under Ice hit you hard and hit you often. Riff-master James Hetfield has a very good showing, as he constructs some of thrash metal's finest songs with this release. Former bandmate, Dave Mustaine also has writing credits on the album as well. The Megadeth mainman only has credits on two of the songs, Ride the Lightning and Call of Ktulu, but on the flipside, they are two of the albums best tracks. They are very lengthy, but neither of the tracks loses their momentum at any point, as each moment is vital to the track. But long lengths aren't limited to Dave Mustaine's songs. Two of the other tracks, Fade to Black and Creeping Death also exceed the 6 minute mark (with Fade to Black approaching 7 minutes). But not to worry, the remaining tracks are four to five minutes in length. These tracks are just as aggressive as their longer counterparts, and definitely do not lose out in intensity. The energy found on Creeping Death and Fight Fire With Fire alike is superb and adds to the enjoyment of the album. Also notable is the lead guitar work of Kirk Hammet. While he has been criticized for not experimenting enough in his solos, what can be found on Metallica's sophomore album will show you why. His variety of shredding is very well done and very fun to listen to. His solo in Fade to Black is definitely one of my favourites in the thrash metal genre, as it remains melodic and emotional while technical at the same time. Musically is where Metallica shines, he this may be the best musical effort of their career, thus far.\n\nVocalist James Hetfield will never be remembered as one of metal's greatest vocalists. But this album does mark a large improvement over his Kill Em All effort. Indeed, though his singing is not perfect he has several excellent performances in songs like Fade to Black and Ride the Lightning. The former is a very emotional track and James does a very good job setting the sombre mood with his passionate vocal delivery. In the latter comes a vocal delivery which is a better representation of Hetfield's efforts of the album. He has a rough voice similar to many in the thrash genre, a vocal technique he makes use of for much of the album. His vocal style fits the music very well, feeding off the energetic tracks. Again, James Hetfield may not be the most technical singer in metal, but he still has a very solid showing, especially in the title track.\n\nOne of the major things that brought Kill Em All down, at least for me, was the production. With Ride the Lightning, the messy sound quality found on the band's debut album has improved significantly. The guitar sound in particular is much, much better than it was on Kill Em All. The guitars are still heavy and still retain that thrashy metallic sound, but what they do loose is that annoying fuzzy sound that came in their previous releases. The quality of Hetfield's vocals is also much better, as I mentioned earlier. Where in the past, a once annoying shout/growl mixed in with the music, it has been replaced by a clearer voice that stands out much more adequately. Yes, the production could be better, but for an album recorded by a smaller band in 1984, it isn't all that bad.\n\nAs long as the genre is around, Metallica will leave a long lasting legacy over metal. Their first four releases are heralded as some of the genre's finest works and it isn't hard to see why. Though 1986's Master of Puppets is generally regarded as the band's best, I'd have to disagree. Ride the Lightning is Metallica's best album. Every aspect that made Metallica such a great band can be found on this album. Hell, many of the elements that made thrash such an interesting genre can be found here. Ride the Lightning is a fine album, and I recommend it to everybody.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nAfter 1986's critically acclaimed Master of Puppets, it was quite obvious that it would be incredibly tough for Metallica to release a record which could top the album which many perceive to be the band's maximum opus. This would be a difficult task for most bands to accomplish. However, most bands do not lose dear friends and band mates in tour bus accidents. The death of bassist Cliff Burton was definitely a blow to Metallica, and likely affected the writing process of their next album. But they survived the ordeal and in 1988, looked to release \u2026And Justice for All. Predictably, the album had nothing on their previous works. Though by no means a terrible offering, Metallica's fourth album is quite unlike both Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets, as it is a difficult album to both get into and enjoy. \n\nLike its predecessors, \u2026And Justice for All is rooted in the thrash metal genre. The opening track, Blackened definitely shows listeners this. Yet something is definitely different this time. The riffy elements of songs like Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets were one of the reasons I enjoyed each respective song and album so much. Metallica definitely has not forsaken the almighty guitar riff, but if I told you that the riffs and solos off this album were a treat to listen to, I'd be lying to you. In the past, the metallic sound that Metallica had once incorporated into their music has disappeared, for the most part. Often times the riffing sounds tasteless and dull. Something I'm not accustomed to when listening to early Metallica. Hetfield's rhythm work sounds weak, muffled and isn't exactly the most pleasing thing to listen to, especially when Lars Ulrich's drumming seemingly overpower them. In laymen's terms, the production is atrocious, and negatively affects the album in a rather large way. On the positive side, the solos of lead guitarist Kirk Hammet are not affected as much as the riffs, but a significant point makes this moot. Kirk Hammet is obviously not soloing for the entire record. What does this mean? The listless riff work is far more prominent, partly due to the extremely long track times. Because of the uninteresting song structure and the monotone rhythm guitar tones, I sometimes find myself completely ignoring Hammet's soloing. I guess soloing over white noise seems to be rendered ineffective. Musically, \u2026And Justice for All is a very disappointing album.\n\nBut the negativity does not stop there, unfortunately. For \u2026And Justice for All contains another irritating aspect, and again, this revolves around a rather important part of the album. This is the extremely long length of the album. Long run times aren't always a problem for me. But they are in this case, as Metallica only records two songs that are shorter than 6 minutes. So, how is this a problem, you ask? As a result of James' lacklustre riffs, the album plods along at a snail pace. Songs like the title track and To Live is to Die are both nearly 10 minutes in length and both tracks are adequate examples of what went wrong with Metallica in 1988. Nearly every song drags on for much longer than they should, and are rather boring to listen to. Due to the insipidly slow mood and atmosphere that many of the songs create, \u2026And Justice for All feels a lot (lots of stress here) longer than it really is. I don't like that in my music. This was a major turn off for me, as Metallica's fourth album is very difficult to listen to, to begin with, and the incredibly long lengths of the tracks don\u2019t help at all.\n\nThough definitely not on the level of Master of Puppets, \u2026And Justice for All was still a successful album and helped cement Metallica's legacy. Saying that, I can't see why the album gets so much praise at all. The band's fourth full length offering is a very dull album which often fails to maintain any interest what so ever. Quite difficult to listen to, it offers little in the field of enjoyment, and does not capitalize on the momentum that might have been gained from classic tracks like Blackened and One. \u2026And Justice for All is definitely the weakest Metallica album of the 80's and is definitely not worth the $20 it costs. Avoid this whenever possible.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",

        "\nAccording to Lars, Metallica was jokingly calling themselves \u201cRocktallica\u201d in the studio before the album ever came out. This, then, is without a doubt Metallica\u2019s sellout album. However, it doesn\u2019t sound like \u201cModern Rocktallica\u201d or \u201cAltallica\u201d or even \u201cAC/tallica\u201d.\nIf I had to put this in a genre, I would call it grove/doom metal. Nearly every song has a monster riff that gets driven into the ground, and then underground through the earth\u2019s crust by the groove part of the equation. Musically, it\u2019s no Permanent Waves or Images and Words. Hell, it\u2019s not even on the level of Powerage. Then again, I am a COMPLETE Bon Scott fanboy, so that\u2019s probably not a good comparison. \n\n\u2026okay, the individual performances. Musically, Lars \u201cFUCK!\u201d Ulrich should have stuck to tennis. He is, and has always been, a crap drummer, even on Justice. Hell, my thirteen- year-old brother can do that. Then again, my thirteen-year-old brother can play Dream Theater\u2019s \u201cHome\u201d with one bass drum and one pedal. Go figure. On the other hand, Jason is a good bass player, not quite up to Cliff\u2019s level, but good nonetheless. It does feel like the others in the band are still relegating him to a supporting role, but when he is given a chance to play, (\u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d) he\u2019s not bad at all. James\u2019 voice has certainly changed, and I don\u2019t know whether I like that or not. His enjoyable metalhead yelling on the first three albums has degenerated into a cowboy growl, and it works well for some songs, badly for others. Kirk\u2019s solos are okay, but they are mostly soulless and strangely \u201cbluesy\u201d. He also overuses his wah-wah pedal. A lot. \n\nStill there are plenty of good songs on here, including \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d. It might be because I have stopped listening to radio (\u201cWe\u2019ll play the song over and over and over again until people get sick of it, and then we\u2019ll keep playing it, mwahahaha.\u201d), but I like the song. It has an absolutely evil riff, a nicely done creepy bridge, and, oh yeah, it\u2019s also catchy as hell, so much that I\u2019ve heard less catchy Bachman Turner Overdrive songs. The problem is that to get to the next good song, you have to skip all the way to track 9, \u201cOf Wolf and Man\u201d. Why this song wasn\u2019t a huge hit is beyond me, but it demonstrates that the kind of metal that \u2018Tallica was aiming to create on this album wasn\u2019t inherently flawed. It\u2019s a mid-paced, stomping, chest-thumping anthem, no less, and a great riff, too. The lyrics about being a werewolf are crap, but James could be singing anything, and the song would still be solid. The third and last great song on the album is \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d. It\u2019s not a great song because of its music, which is slow and doomy, but rather because of the pure venom and anger that James projects in his lyrics. It\u2019s a great song simply because it has all the raw emotion of a man questioning why his mother had to die.\n\nTwo other songs on the album are definitely worth listening to. \u201cDon\u2019t Tread On Me\u201d works because it has patriotic lyrics that aren\u2019t blind flag-waving drivel (*coughIcedEarthcough*), along with a military march-like groove and (gasp) another cool riff. \u201cThrough the Never\u201d is also a good song, with lyrics far better than anything on the first four albums. It\u2019s somewhat up-tempo, but midpaced compared to anything on the albums that came before it. I don\u2019t mind that a lot, but it does take away some of the frantic, pounding majesty that songs like \u201cBattery\u201d, \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d, and \u201cFight Fire With Fire\u201d had. \n\nThere are a few more songs worth mentioning, and not in a good way. \u201cSad But True\u201d is one of the most pointless songs Metallica has ever written. There is nothing about this song that doesn\u2019t annoy me. It starts out with a cool intro riff, which promptly disappears. Then it lurches into a boring riff that sounds like \u201cSymphony of Destruction\u201d caught in quicksand. Then James starts near-rapping the lyrics, which suck. Kirk\u2019s annoying drone during the chorus tops it off. Ugh. Too bad it became a \u201cclassic\u201d that Metallica play every concert, because it\u2019s crap. \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d made me cry the first time I heard it. It still makes me cry, but now I cry with boredom. Half-ballads with boring chugging verses and \u201cemotional\u201d choruses (akoustic guitars r teh emo!!!11) are not what Metallica should be known for. And \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d, well, imagine the acoustic chorus of \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d stretched out into a whole song. It\u2019s crap, except for Kirk\u2019s solo, which owns any other solo Kirk has done after Kill\u2019Em All. \n\nThere\u2019s some good stuff on this album. It\u2019s not an essential album to have, but it\u2019s OK nonetheless. Historically, however, it marked the end of Metallica\u2019s rule of metal. Don\u2019t expect a masterpiece like Ride the Lightning.\n",
        "\n\u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d, words that divide the metal community, to some it\u2019s a landmark achievement, to others it\u2019s the point at which it all went horribly wrong. This is plainly evident if you read any review of this album. But how does a single album divide the metal community so much? Might it actually be not this album itself, but the events that followed this album? Many questions can be asked, and it\u2019s doubtful anyone will ever find a definite answer to any of them. \n\nBut one element of \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d always seems to be overlooked: the music. \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d provides us with some of the best music Metallica made. However there is one main problem: it is nearly the exact same album as \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d. From the acoustic intro, to the similar track-listing, and similar lyrical themes, this is the fraternal twin of its predecessor. Seeing as \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d was so good, it wouldn\u2019t be that hard to imagine that an album that follows the same blueprint would at least equal it. That is where \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d falters, it almost matches, and moreover fails to exceed its predecessor.\n\nBut why does \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d falter? Or better yet, where does it falter? Well, one reason why may be that there isn\u2019t anymore ideas they can use the Dave Mustaine left with them. And while there is no single point at which this album falters, but there are just moments that don\u2019t live up. Take, for instance, \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d, which wants to be \u201cFade to Black\u201d, but it just isn\u2019t, so in that case, this album doesn\u2019t equal \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d.\n\nAnother problem is that this album is so hailed that sometimes when listened to, it disappoints. However that doesn\u2019t mean this is a horrid disappointment, but it just doesn\u2019t live up to the title of \u201cgreatest metal album ever\u201d. \n\nWhat about the material on \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d? Well, there are some really good songs, and some middle of the road songs, and some not so good songs. Some that dwell in the good songs category are: the mammoth title track, \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d and the classy instrumental \u201cOrion\u201d. Some of the middle of the road songs are: the opener \u201cBattery\u201d, the doomy \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d, and the thrashy closer \u201cDamage Inc.\u201d. And then we have the not so good songs: \u201c(Welcome Home) Sanitarium\u201d, \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d, and \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d. The main problem with the last three songs is that each wants to be another song, \u201c(Welcome Home) Sanitarium\u201d wants to be \u201cFade to Black\u201d, \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d wants to be \u201cFor Whom The Bell Tolls\u201d and \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d wants to be \u201cCreeping Death\u201d. But remember all these songs are rated in context to the rest of the songs on the album, so even the not so good songs are better than some of the best songs on other albums (both by Metallica, and other bands).\n\nAnother problem that is becoming evident is that the solos have a tendency to become tedious and boring. Most evident is the solo on \u201c(Welcome Home) Sanitarium\u201d. Kirk Hammett\u2019s best solos are the fast, skilled and full of feeling, there is instances where he lacks all three of these elements on this album, for the most part. This trend would become more evident as the years went by. \n\nOn the other hand we have vocalist and rhythm guitarist, of course, James Hetfield. On \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d his vocals seem to have matured some, along with his rhythm guitar-work being one of the albums driving force. There is nothing wrong with his performance, but at times his vocals sound tired, aside from that it is flawless.\n\nNext is drummer/future talking head, Lars Ulrich, who again improves on the drums, the last time he would do so on an album. The drums sound perfect on this album, production wise, there are no rattles or clicks, just solid thunderous beats. \n\nAnd of course there\u2019s legendary bassist Cliff Burton, who alongside Ulrich and Hetfield, provide one incredibly intense rhythm section. Of course this wound up being his last record, and that does make \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d special in a sense, but not only for that reason alone. His death often gets in the way of his performance, which when listened to will remind you why he is so hailed. A lot of people have made music and then passed away, but he is remembered for the caliber of music he made, which of course, is overwhelmingly excellent.\n\nSo, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s Metallica\u2019s \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d with all its faults and all its achievements. It\u2019s not the best metal album ever made, it\u2019s a pretty damn good one, but there are better. But \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d stands on its own as a very enigmatic, dividing, and controversial album. For the range of opinions of this album, it is best taken in for ones self.\n",
        "\n...the problem is that it's totally mediocre.\n\nSo Metallica stopped playing metal on this album (shouldn't have come as a surprise to anyone who'd heard the self-titled; it was pretty clear where they were headed). Since this was intended as a hard rock album and NOT a metal album, perhaps we ought to review it as such.\n\nAnd that's where we run into trouble. For hard rock, it's really not all that good. For one thing, James sounds absolutely dreadful (and he only got worse), Kirk seems to have dedicated himself to proving that the principle of \"too much of a good thing isn't good\" also applies to the wah-pedal by riding it mercilessly (to the detriment of every single solo), and Jason and Lars are just there without doing anything interesting.\n\nThe songs themselves are inconsistent, with some good (\"Hero of the Day\" and \"Wasting My Hate,\" for instance), some bad (\"Until it Sleeps,\" \"Bleeding Me,\" many others), some that would be good if James didn't sound so pathetic (\"Ain't My Bitch,\" \"Ronnie\"), and some that are absolute rubbish (\"2x4,\" \"The House that Jack Built\"). And then there's \"Mama Said,\" which deserves special mention because it was such a bad idea. \"Hey, look, we made a country song! Look how diverse we are!\" cry Metallica. Says I, \"Yes, but you're not good at it. Go listen to some Robert Earl Keen.\" If you're going to hard rock, do it right, and if you're going to country, you had damn well BETTER do it right.\n\nI also feel like I should mention \"Outlaw Torn.\" 9:48 is absolutely unacceptable, especially for this stuff. Now, \"Master of Puppets\" was perfect at 8 and a half, but \"Outlaw Torn\" is a five-minute song stretched to nearly double its length for no apparent reason. This is exactly what hurt ...And Justice For All, and it's a tendency that a lot of bands suffer from - I'd go so far as to say that 75% of all \"epic\" songs don't really need to be as long as they are. In fact, let this be a lesson to bands around the world: we know you THINK your song is interesting enough to last ten minutes, but chances are, it's probably not.\n\nBut I digress. Anyway, bottom line: not that great. Some interesting songs, but nothing absolutely essential. Plus, you have to suffer through way too much bullshit to get to the good stuff. Of course people bought it up and hailed it as revolutionary because this famous metal band was branching out into unfamiliar territory. However, at its core, it's a feeble, inconsistent attempt at a hard rock album, made no less feeble or inconsistent by the fact that it has Metallica's name on it. Pass on this one and get one of Clutch's three most recent albums instead.\n",
        "\nThe \u201cblack album\u201d has gone down in history as one of the most controversial heavy metal albums of all time. At the time of its release a lot of \u201cMetallica\u2019s\u201d hardcore fans were largely disappointed. The reason was the huge turn in musical direction. \n\nThe band had already successfully positioned themselves in the highest ranks of heavy metal with back to back speed/thrash classics, \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d and \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d. The highly technical and progressive thrash nature of \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d had put them well ahead of the metal scene at the time and fans eagerly awaited the follow up album. \n\nTo the hardcore fans\u2019 disappointment the \u201cBlack Album\u201d, as it has been called ever since its release in 1991 (due to its all-black cover), significantly deviated from the previous \u201cMetallica\u201d song writing formulas.\n\nThe album contained smaller in duration songs that were built in most cases around one riff. The songs were catchy with choruses that stayed with the listener long after the album had finished. Hell\u2026 that was nothing compared to the fact that the album enclosed for the first time ever a clear-cut ballad in \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d. That was something that a great deal of fans at the time were not ready to accept. \u201cMetallica\u201d had sold out\u2026 \n\nThe album is nowadays considered to be a modern classic even by many earlier disappointed hardcore fans. It contains classic \u201cMetallica\u201d hits such as \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d, \u201cSad But True\u201d, \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d and \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d which have become a vital part of the band\u2019s set list for live shows. Besides the obvious hits the album also contains compositions of great quality and depth. Songs such as \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d, \u201cThe God that Failed\u201d and \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d best illustrate \u201cMetallica\u2019s\u201d ability in writing classic songs and arranging parts in such a way so that the individual talents of its members are fully utilized. \n\nThe \u201cBlack Album\u201d contains some of Hetfield\u2019s heaviest (neck-braking at times) riffs. Hammett provides some of his finest melodic solos. The album also includes the most interesting basslines Newsted ever recorded and Ulrich\u2019s most straightforward playing (which still took him forever to finish according to one of the stories told in the \u201cblack album\u201d classic series DVD). The emphasis is therefore put on the mighty riff, which assumes the leading role and on Hetfield\u2019s passionate vocal performance that effectively connects to the listener. \n\nAs far as lyrics are concerned, the album contains both some childish fantasy Hetfield efforts as in \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d but for the most part \u201cMetallica\u2019s\u201d main man effectively delivers passionate lyrics about his childhood in \u201cThe God that Failed\u201d, the brotherhood bond between the band members in \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d, the life on the road in \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d and (a personal favorite) upbringing and conformance to society stereotypes and rules in \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d. The last song is the closest \u201cMetallica\u201d have ever got to be to their \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d and \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d albums, lyrically-wise. \n\nOne of the reasons this album is very often cited for, is its amazing production and mix. Bob Rock might as well have delivered the best sounding album ever in heavy metal\u2019s almost 40 years of existence. Not only are all instruments clearly audible, they are also mixed in the most professional way to formulate three-dimensional sounding songs. One can easily hear the crunchy guitar sound above all instruments. Then right below the bass frequency plays its own important role adding both depth and the necessary melodic line, with the exceptional drum and cymbal sound complementing everything perfectly. The vocal harmonies are on top of everything else, sounding strong and driving all the songs to higher levels. This one is probably Hetfield\u2019s best vocal performance to date.\n\nThe only serious drawback I find in this album is \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d which I find to be a rather poor composition in comparison to the other songs. I think the album could easily afford lacking this one. Other than that I would say that \u201cMetallica\u201d as an album is not as good or as quality-oriented as any of the band\u2019s previous recordings, song writing-wise. Still, no one can deny that this is the last great heavy metal album by the band.\n\nConcluding, I would like to set the following questions:\n\nHow would you call an album so much debated upon its initial release? \nHow would you call an album which was hated immensely by many of the band\u2019s hardcore fans? \nFinally, how would you call an album that besides the aforementioned has effectively stood the test of time year after year and has managed to turn the haters into lovers?\n\nI would call it a Classic Heavy Metal album.\n",
        "\nFinally, after years of making news with everything except their music, Metallica released \u201cSt. Anger\u201d. The chaos of this album nearly perfectly sums up the chaos of the band. From the departure of longtime bassist Jason Newsted, to the stint in rehab for James Hetfield, there was quite a bit of this chaos, and surely enough to go around for everyone.\n\nThe most evident feature is its lack of complication and how the message of the album is made to hit you immediately and not let you soak it in. \u201cSt. Anger\u201d has one of the most self torturous moods ever put to record, as it seems most is written as a view of a band as a broken unit. \u201cSt. Anger\u201d has very little of the usually themes that one might find in a Metallica album, there is very little social commentary, none of the issues of religion, and none of the impending doom. \u201cSt. Anger\u201d provides its lyrics as though the doom is here, the personal demons have caught up and now are destroying it as they speak. This album from beginning to end is one harsh slab of self-loathing.\n\nAs for the band itself, there seems to be no band, just three men who aren\u2019t sure what to do. This is very much James Hetfield\u2019s album, most lyrics seem to deal with his problems. His vocals are raw, sneering and jagged. His rhythm guitar is the focus for most of the album, and as that there are no solos, he takes much of limelight. As for Kirk Hammett, his contributions are slim to none, though it seems not through his own doing. Gone are Kirk\u2019s solos in favor of a rhythmic sonic assault. Also, instead of a unison guitar attack, Kirk and James rely on a tag team of sorts, each handing certain guitar parts over to the other. Provided the percussive backbone Lars Ulrich sits back and takes over with the some of the most powerful drumming of his career, to bad it seems his drum set has be taken and replaced with some old pots and pans, along with an old metal garbage can. \n\nAnd what for the songs on \u201cSt. Anger\u201d? They\u2019re a sonic assault which represents the jagged edges of the band and their mindset. The album for the most part is driven by a thrashy groove, but has mellow part juxtaposed again those jagged thrash part which give more power to both. \u201cFrantic\u201d, the opener, is one of their thrashiest songs made in many years, however, do not confuse the fact that it is thrashy with it being thrash itself. The title track, \u201cSt. Anger\u201d is a respectable piece of music, and while it is nowhere near classic, it rightfully deserves its Metallica namesake. Same goes for the brilliant \u201cSome Kind of Monster\u201d, while it will never live in the same area code of, say, \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d, it\u2019s a raw slab of heavy fucking metal. \u201cInvisible Kid\u201d may be the one of the most moving pieces, lyrically, of the album, speaking of both alienation and depression of a young mind.\n\n\u201cSt. Anger\u201d is in noway a throwback, and it is not a comeback, it is however an expression of how Metallica was at that point and time. So for fans who have been jaded already, pick this back up and think of it as that, not as a return to form, and not as a comeback, you might just find a harsh, interesting insight into the band at that point and time.\n",
        "\nIs there good music, or is it all a matter of opinion? Well, my viewpoint is there good and bad music, but it can't really be defined that way. Rather, there is product and art- that is, music that is designed to sell, and music that is an expression of what the artist is/was going through at the time it was created. Product and art- or, good and bad music, as such. \n\nNow, what does this have to do with this album? Well, simply put, this album is product in every sense of the word. The production is crisp and extremely radio friendly, the chorus becomes the biggest part of the song, and everything is shortened, compressed to hell and made supremely catchy. Everything about this album is designed to sell, which is something Metallica haven't before, or even after this album. So, it's a sellout.. shortly it must suck then? Well, it isn't exactly that simple. What this album loses in lack of integrity it makes up for in it's sheer catchiness and melody. Simply put, this album is Arena metal at it's most entertaining.\n\nThis album is a very consistent album, there's no doubt about it. Enter Sandman has that cool intro and huge chorus that we are all completely sick off- but listening to the tune with an open mind shows you why it's so popular. Sickeningly catchy vocal melody, quite possibly the most memorable solo Kirk has ever done, and a simple but effective main riff. Most bands wish they could do something this good. This formula is repeated throughout the album, with few deviations. Sad but True is slow and crushing, Don't Tread on Me is full of big military style riffs, and more excellent vocals, and Holier then Thou is as close to Thrash as this album gets, with a surprisingly heavy opening, and again, a super catchy chorus.\n\nWhen Metallica aren't delivering these tunes, there's some power ballads- the auto-biographical Unforgiven, and the classically-tinged Nothing else Matters, which comes complete with a string section. This song, despite it's lovely guitar parts, is probably where Metallica go a bit wrong. The lyrics make no sense, the solo is pure arena rock cheese, and the whole song just goes \"Look how hard we are trying to be mellow and different!\" Metallica have delivered the whole introspection thing extremely well in other albums (You've got Fade to Black, Bleeding Me, even something like Low Man's Lyric), but within the context of this album, the whole emotional, vulnerable power ballad doesn't really ring true. While the Unforgiven works quite well, Nothing Else Matters comes across as Shallow and Empty.\n\nAmidst all the ballads and rocky tunes, it's when Metallica go a little bit back to their roots that the songs are the best. Of Wolf and Man and The God that Failed are probably the only two radio unfriendly tunes here, with Of Wolf.. having some real nice crunchy riffs, and a sweet galloping main riff. The God that Failed, meanwhile, is a slow/mid tempo crusher, with some venomous vocals and a solo that's a bit more shreddy then most of the ones in this album. You've also got Struggle Within, which is the last, and possibly the best song on the album, with an unforgettable intro, a huge call and response style chorus, and a super melodic solo.\n\nOf course, any review of the Black Album is incomplete if you don't mention the production. Personally, I love it- it's perfect for the songs, and at the time it set a high water mark for good hard rock production. The guitars are layered, crunchy and full of weight, the bass is actually audible (!!!), and the drums, while slightly snare heavy, are full and fat. Of course, it's the vocals that are the centrepoint of this album- and damn, they're good. In my opinion, James' voice hit a peak in Load, but here he's got that aggressive-yet melodic style down pat. Basically, the production is pristine, and very hi-fi, which is the only kind of thing that would work for this album.\n\nSo, I've been raving about the way this album excels at the whole \"incredibly commercial arena metal\" thing, but, of course, that's where it falls down too. While I'm not a Lars hater, I would say that the drumming is incredibly repetitive and fairly retarded. The only people who can get away with repetitive drumming are the guy in AC/DC, and possibly the dude in Isis. But seriously, this drumming is disgusting. It's the same beat in every song, and the fills are rarely anything too special. It's a shame that after the great beats in AJFA, the drumming could be so sub-standard. The guitars aren't as bad, of course, (it is Hetfield we're talking about, remember), and while I know they're not meant to be as complex as they where in previous albums, it's still a disappointment that there's nothing like Blackened. Oh well. \n\nI guess a way to conclude this review, and to sum up the problems of this album is by saying that Metallica wanted to sell a lot of records, and this is the kind of album that can do that. It is catchy, melodic and an example of how to make commercial metal and get rich as a result. As a result of that, however, it's soulless and the songs, however catchy, do not stick with you. This album is a great record for driving, or for getting drunk to, but that's about it. Those who want a life changing experience will want to look to Justice For All.\n",
        "\nAfter years of success, critical acclaim, personal loss, and fan backlash Metallica had seen it all. It also seemed that they had done everything they had really wanted to do. So the question was quite simply: What to do next? Easy, make a covers album! \n\nGarage Inc. has no new material by Metallica, unless you count the new covers. Sadly, this is the best thing that they might have done in the 90s since the \u201cBlack Album\u201d, maybe because Hetfield or Ulrich isn\u2019t on any of the writing credits. \n\nGoing back to the new covers of the album, all on disc one, are generally really good, but the choices of the artists to cover is somewhat suspect. For example, although I enjoyed the song, \u201cTurn the Page\u201d is originally by Bob Seger, and somehow for a band that for 10 years only talked about obscure NWOBHM bands, Seger seems to be a bit of a departure from that. But one thing that they should be given credit for is that for the bands they did cover, they did some of the lesser known songs. Also a decent guest heavy cover of Lynyrd Skynyrds \u201cTuesday\u2019s Gone\u201d is on disc one. Despite its oddity of covers ranging from Lynyrd Skynyrd to Mercyful Fate, this range adds a lot of character to the first disc, it might otherwise not have.\n\nChoice cuts of Disc One: \u201cTurn the Page\u201d, \u201cMercyful Fate\u201d, \u201cDie, Die My Darling\u201d, and \u201cWhiskey in the Jar\u201d. \n\nDisc Two contains previously recorded covers, which might not have the same production quality; it has so much more energy and vigor. It contains Jason Newsted\u2019s Metallica recording debut in \u201cThe $5.98 EP \u2013 Garage Days Re-Revisited\u201d which is a good value and really increases the value of \u201cGarage Inc.\u201d if someone doesn\u2019t already have it. Another value booster is the inclusion of the \u201cCreeping Death\u201d b-sides \u201cAm I Evil?\u201d and \u201cBlitzkrieg\u201d, both very good examples of exuberant young Metallica honoring their NWOBHM heroes. Of the \u201cB-Sides and One Offs\u201d section my favorites are \u201cBreadfan\u201d, which is better than the original by Budgie, hands down, along with \u201cStone Cold Crazy\u201d. And wrapping up disc two is the \u201cMotorheadache \u201895\u201d, Motorhead tribute, \u201cOverkill\u201d being my favorite.\n\nChoice cuts of Disc Two: \u201cBreadfan\u201d, \u201cStone Cold Crazy\u201d and all \u201cThe $5.98 EP\u201d. This disc will be enjoyed more by fans of their 80s material.\n\nOverall, Metallica\u2019s \u201cGarage Inc.\u201d is quite an interesting little insight into the influences of Metallica. Also it is quite interesting, is what they do to modify each song to fit them. \u201cGarage Inc.\u201d is best suited for fans that might not have the budget or time to track down all of these separate releases.\n",
        "\nOne of metal\u2019s all-time most triumphant moments, the self-titled, fifth full-length release from these Bay Area bashers shows a refined, stripped-down sound in compassion to the overtly technical \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d as well as a move away from the tinny sound of that record in favor of a much beefier mix. James Hetfield\u2019s vocal approach here is deeper and more rumbling than ever, matching well with the mammoth strains of \u201cSad But True\u201d as Lars Ulrich\u2019s precise timely pounding carries the load. \u201cHolier Than Thou\u201d kicks in with a suitably thrashing riff, this up-tempo rager being one of the album\u2019s most metal moments. Bassist Jason Newsted provides not only a substantial bass performance on the sure-footed \u201cOf Wolf And Man\u201d, but contributes some authoritative backing vocals as well, a component Metallica records had sorely missed in the past. \n\nMournful dirging ensues with the uncharacteristically melodic hit \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d, where lead guitarist Kirk Hammett chips in a highly emotional solo that bursts with feeling. By this point, Hammett had developed into a masterful player, pulling influence from a wide assortment of stylizations in order to make up his soulful, original sounding style of soloing. Metallica delve further into sonic experimentation on the Middle Eastern sounding \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d, a track that has since become a live staple as well as a fan favorite. \n\nThe group rekindles the vibes of their thrash metal roots on the burly, hammering \u201cThrough The Never\u201d, whilst injecting a forceful chorus that paves the way for yet another slick, tasty Hammett lead. \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d kicks off in very similar fashion to Megadeth\u2019s \u201cDawn Patrol\u201d before lapsing into a crunching lurch as Hetfield spits forth determinedly noxious vox and \u201cThe Struggle Within\u201d marches forward into a kicking groove with no remorse whatsoever, ending the record in assuredly intense fashion.\n\nUltimately, it would be the character of two extremely diverse offerings that would characterize this enormously popular release, the textured, slowly building \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d (the album\u2019s first single) and its polar opposite, the deeply introverted and tuneful \u201cNothing Else Matters.\u201d The former would go on to become one of the most recognized songs in all of heavy metal while the latter would cast light on the group\u2019s ever growing diversity, proving that even the hardest of the hard have their softer, more sympathetic moments.\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Black Album\u201d for it\u2019s dim looking, minimalistic cover depicting a barely readable Metallica logo and a patently recognizable serpent symbol, \u201cMetallica\u201d would go on to sell millions and millions of copies, making the still youthful four piece the most extreme metal ensemble to reach such a massive degree of popularity. If, for some unknown reason, you are not in possession of this massive metal milestone you should feel shamed, indeed.\n",
        "\nSan Francisco based Metallica would turn a lot of heads with 1984\u2019s crushing thrash manifesto, \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d, but it would be with the release of \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d that the group would set their sights directly on world domination. Unpretentious, furious and most certainly heavier than hell, this record was a deafening roar in the face of an unsuspecting metal audience, many of whom were at the time unprepared for a hammering onslaught such as \u201cBattery.\u201d One smoking stereo system later, the band dives head on into the muscular title cut. This song would prove to be one of metal\u2019s all-time classic tracks, bringing the spotlight directly on thrash metal during the group\u2019s subsequent tour with wasted metal madman Ozzy Osbourne. \n\nThis record established Flemming Rasmussen as a top-notch heavy metal producer, as the expert knob-twister pulled every bit of heaviness out of the band while giving them a full yet slick overall sound that would become the benchmark for many metal albums to follow. Providing an amply spooky atmosphere, the colossal, massively detuned \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d possesses one of the preeminent doom-laden riffs that a metal band has undertaken to date. James Hetfield\u2019s singing on this track cannot be underestimated in any fashion. In retrospect, his voice here is as cool sounding and awe-inspiring as it ever has been. Metallica, by this point, have gelled into a cohesive unit with a common goal of complete musical destruction at whatever tempo.\n\nA track that would easily make the top ten Metallica songs of all time, \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d mashes a forlorn, melodic verse with a weighty, commanding chorus. On \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, the group had gotten much better at combining melody with pure heaviness. This is plainly noticeable on the brooding plea entitled \u201cWelcome Home\u201d, which displays intentional, intricate harmonic subtlety as well as Metallica\u2019s patented, overpowering forcefulness. Both \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d as well as \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d resonate songwriting strength and substantial thickness and bass guitarist Cliff Burton\u2019s amazing instrumental \u201cOrion\u201d offers the listener a devastating array of riffing and sharp metal licks, showing that Burton had a tremendous impact on the intricacy of the band\u2019s songwriting overall. \n\nEnter \u201cDamage Inc.\u201d, the album\u2019s closer. Doubtlessly, this track is the most severe thrashing that many a metal fan had ever encountered, with a blistering pace that made it the most extreme thing going in 1986. Lars Ulrich shows here why he deserves to be the drummer for the world\u2019s largest heavy metal band, his sharp attention to detail surpassed only by his precise bashing. Having just created a metal masterpiece, the group would unfortunately be stricken by tragedy before they had even finished properly promoting the album.\n\nTimeless, boundary-obliterating and brimming with a furious energy, \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d is a cornerstone in the kingdom of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nOn \u201cReload\u201d, Metallica often sound like a group that has run out of creative musical ideas, being the sister record to the group\u2019s 1996 \u201cLoad\u201d release, with the material stemming from the same sessions as that lackluster effort, proving that a combination of the best tracks from the two would have made a fantastic accomplishment, but as separate entities, both of these records fail to recapture the magic that metal fans have come to associate with Metallica.\n\nAdmittedly, the group was embroiled in experimentation, looking to meld their massive thrash revered by so many metalheads with a more commercial approach tracks such as the tepid \u201cDevils Dance\u201d or the downright boring, cheeseball \u201cBetter Than You\u201d (which sounds more like a throwaway from the Metallica sessions). Producer Bob Rock does his damnedest to make Metallica sound like Motley Crue on the utterly abysmal \u201cSlither.\u201d Here, the listener gains the impression that Metallica are desperately trying to be something that they most certainly are not. \n\nThere are a handful of redeeming moments such as the high-energy \u201cFuel\u201d and the massive, appropriately doomy \u201cThe Memory Remains.\u201d Even a reworking of an earlier cut, \u201cThe Unforgiven II\u201d has a fair amount of appeal, but in coupling with the majority of this record, it seems quite obvious that at this point, Metallica were running out of ideas and most definitely out of touch with the changing face of heavy metal. Other dismal tracks being not even worthy of mention, \u201cReload\u201d stands as the absolute worst album in Metallica\u2019s storied history. Further proof that the producer makes the band, these guys should give Bob Rock the pink slip for he is single-handedly contributing to the complete ruin of one of metal\u2019s giants. \u201cReload\u201d is guaranteed to collect at least a half inch of dust before you care to pull it back out again.\n",
        "\nNow that I\u2019ve finally found a little time to get around to reviewing (and re-reviewing) the bulk of my thrash metal collection, it\u2019s only a matter of picking a good place to start. And what better place than well-known territory? Kill \u2018Em All, one of the earliest thrash LP\u2019s, is the debut record of an obscure 80\u2019s metal band by the name of Metallica, a band that would gain massive fame from the genre before abandoning it altogether for wishy-washy modern rock like that on Load/Re-load. But you already knew that. \n\nThe Metallica playing on Kill \u2018Em All were nothing like the Metallica playing on Re-load. This was a band that held a strong claim over the elementary form of thrash metal not because they had sold the most albums, but because they were a part of the scene in spirit as well as name. The Metallica on here was a raging, pissed-off, riff-happy heavy metal unit poised to slaughter all who would challenge their dominance. And yet few if any modern thrash metal bands admit to being influenced by them. This I find completely absurd, as nearly every one of them has taken something from Metallica\u2019s legacy (Fueled by Fire derive their whole fucking sound from them). Well, given the current state of the scene, maybe they should be taken a hint or two from albums like this.\n\nKill \u2018Em All embodies everything that was good about thrash in the 80\u2019s. First and most importantly, Kill \u2018Em All showcases variety. Speed metal ragers like \u201cWhiplash\u201d and \u201cHit the Lights\u201d coexist peacefully with mid-paced classics \u201cSeek and Destroy\u201d and \u201cNo Remorse.\u201d Some tracks are short and punchy (\u2018Motorbreath\u201d) while others are longer and more developed (\u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d). Never mind how many songs Mustaine penned, they were recorded by Metallica and they deserve credit for bringing this music to life. Secondly, there\u2019s a general well-roundedness to the band\u2019s performance. James\u2019 screechy vocals, Kirk\u2019s wild solos, Lars\u2019 frantic drumming, Cliff\u2019s stellar bass lines: all of these mesh together like a well-oiled machine to produce the best possible extension of Diamond Head-style NWOBHM. Compare this to today\u2019s bands that shun clean riffs, mid-paced songs, melody, and variety and Kill \u2018Em All holds up just as well as it ever did. It\u2019s also longer than your typical thrash album, coming in at close to 50 minutes where most bands today barely surpass 30. Basically, it\u2019s classic fucking thrash metal. Rabid drumming, guitars like razor blades, awesome, completely non-substantial lyrics, and a strong bass presence that many of their peers lacked are all reasons that this album continues to kick ass to date.\n\nThe album might appear a bit basic nowadays, considering the multitude of directions that thrash has gone since, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find an extreme metal guitarist that doesn\u2019t know how to play \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d or a bassist who can\u2019t at least partially recreate Cliff Burton\u2019s way-out-of-left-field, distorted, extended, bass solo \u201cAnesthesia (Pulling Teeth).\u201d Material on this album, like the other early Metallica records, is part of the standard metal guitar repertoire along with the early works of Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden. And hell, even though I\u2019ve heard it dozens of times, I still spin this album regularly. Mandatory purchase.\n\nNotable Tracks: \u201cHit the Lights,\u201d \u201cNo Remorse,\u201d \u201cMetal Militia\u201d\n",
        "\nThis was probably the first thrash album I ever bought - I got the Black Album as I started to move away from mainstream rock, and then was advised to go right back to the start. After a few spins, I was only ever destined for a life as a metalhead.\n\nThe thing that really strikes you about this album, is the youthful enthusiasm of it all. Unemcumbered by alcoholism, drug addiction, family and all the rest of it, Kill 'Em All scorches by in a dazzling blur of speed. Hetfield's voice is still a screech, rather than the gruff but clean tone of recent years, the songs are barely developed, full of abrupt speed changes, and the solos are in plentiful supply - at least three in 'The Four Horsemen' alone.\n\nKill' Em All is above all a thrash album that celebrates the glory of metal, for metal's sake. The lyrics show virtually none of the socio-political bent that would surface on later records, instead revelling simply in the general brilliance of the embryonic thrash movement.\n\nThe tone of the whole album is set by the killer first riff to 'Hit The Lights', to this day one of the greatest riffs of all time, and the song itself is a thing of sheer visceral beauty, climaxing with a spiralling solo.\n\nThe rest of Kill 'Em All is simply riff after riff, and the amazing quality of the material is highlighted by the presence to this day of such classic as 'The Four Horsemen', 'Whiplash' and 'Seek And Destroy' in the live set. In fact, last time I saw Metallica, a full 21 years after the release of their debut, cuts from Kill 'Em All outnumbered those from all of the post-Black Album records put together.\n\nHighlights abound: 'Whiplash' in its entirety, so joyously simplistic as to be almost bone-headed, especially the lyrics (They're not funny though. They may look a little cheesy now, but let's be honest. For all of the pseudo-academic bullshit written about extreme music, this review included, \"thrashing all around, acting like a maniac\" is what being a metalhead is all about. Period. Don't over-intellectualise this shit, just get drunk and headbang.) The first signs of the progression and dynamics that will define the classic Metallica period in 'Phantom Lord', 'Motorbreath', about the punkest they ever got, and the Judas Priest-on-speedisms of 'Metal Militia.' The solos throughout are brilliantly played by Kirk Hammett, although credit for the remarkably clever melodic construction must go to Dave Mustaine. Pick up any bootleg of Mustaine playing live with Metallica, and realise Hammett plays all of his solos note for note. I don't want to overstate Mustaine's input in Metallica, there are some idiots out there who claim he single-handedly wrote all of their best stuff, but the contribution is still significant. Their influences are recognisable - Maiden, Venom, Motorhead, almost every obscure NWOBHM band of all time - but on Kill 'Em All, Metallica transcend all of them by just playing harder and faster than anyone who came before.\n\nThat's not to say it's a perfect record. The drumming is shit throughout. Check the hideously out of time fills on 'No Remorse' for proof. Some of the riffing is a little too major-key at times, probably due to the Maiden influence, and 'Jump In The Fire' I've always found a little on the pedestrian side. There is also not enough bass on the record. While Cliff Burton's solo instrumental '(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth' is an interesting curio, and exhibits his serious talent, it is only on the next two albums that his genius really comes to the fore. Minor quibbles really though, in the light of the riches that Kill 'Em All provides. When you're having the greatest sex ever, does it matter if the weather outside is a bit on the drizzly side?\n\nKill 'Em All is certainly not the greatest album of all time. It's not even the greatest Metallica album of all time, they bettered it at least twice. However, it's importance to the genre of metal is arguably the greatest of all their albums, and as a pure statement of intent, it's rarely been bettered by any debut. Kneel before it's might, for the seed of greatness to come was sown in this fucking superb record.\n",
        "\nWhen listening to \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d the thing that always bounces around my mind is \u2018what where they trying to do?\u2019. Were they trying to make some sort of magnum opus? Were they trying to make Master of Puppets part two? \n\nWith the loss of Cliff Burton it is easy to imagine the band taking a few steps backwards. They do not move back musically, however unlike previous albums they make no leap forward from the previous album. Another thing that must be noted is the well has run dry of Dave Mustaine riffs to mold and modify songs around. This effects the sound immensely, there is the introduction of doom metal influence and the songs have become more progressive (only two songs are below six minutes), and most of all is the tinny sound of the guitars.\n\nWhich leads us into the production of the album, it\u2019s awful. Unlike most people I have very few complaints with the bass, it could be farther up in the mix, but even Jason Newsted has said that he basically took James and Kirks guitar riffs and made bass riffs that would fit (behind) the music nicely. Though the bass is still there, it just happens to be deeper and darker, and somewhat more guttural, than anything Cliff ever made. Cliff had a style which intersected and cut through the music, much of the complaints could just be the awkward transition for fans and the band from Cliff (and his style) to Jason (and his respective style). \n\nThe guitars on the album sound bad compared to other albums, both by Metallica and other thrash bands. They have a tinny quality to them. They have a tendency to ring and sound too shrill. I do not understand how this happened, whether it was by choice or by horrid mixing. However their effort is not totally futile, they up the ante on the technicality (with shreds of neo-classical style worked in, no pun intended) to the guitar work, mainly in the solos, but it is also evident in the rhythm guitar.\n\nAs I said earlier about the production is that the bass was not my biggest complaint, however it is the drums. The drums on \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d aren\u2019t really good but what makes them worse is that they seem to be the focal point of the music. On Metallica\u2019s earlier albums the drums pounded with thundering force, on \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d they click and clack. Also the symbols rattle and crackle, and just don\u2019t have the body that it really could.\n\nAnd finally it comes to the vocals. There seems to be a hesitancy to admit that James Hetfield in his heyday was a great singer, and on \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d there is points which really help his case and on others it doesn\u2019t. On as \u201cOne\u201d he provides a very beautiful vocal performance, and his best on this album. One thing that will be instantly noticeable when listening is that there he sounds angry, \nfrustrated and pissed off throughout the whole album.\n\nA few of the more notable songs from the album are the title track \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d, the hit \u201cOne\u201d, the epic \u201cHarvester of Sorrows\u201d and the Cliff Burton tribute in \u201cTo Live is To Die\u201d. I believe that while those are standout songs, the album hits its most epic, doomy, and powerful force when listened to in full. The album develops a tidal wave like intensity that you feel hit you in full force when you try to digest it in full. The album has a truly dynamic edge despite many of its failings. Also, the lyrics are darker and angrier than anything on previous (or even future) albums Metallica made.\n\nOverall, \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d, is a quite impressive album which EVERY metal fan should try, at least. There is musicianship that impresses even the most arrogant classical snob, and still can be comprehensible to even the most basic thrash fan. Despite its faults and failings \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d has integrity and authoritativeness that were lost in later albums, which helps this stand out even more. All this said I cannot assure everyone will like it, but there is no denying its greatness. It can also be looked at the last great Metallica album.\n",
        "\nThis was Metallica\u2019s finest hour both in terms of production and song writing. Unlike the debut, which basically cooked the whole way through, this album has a good deal more variety from track to track and shows a good deal more musicality. The influence of Dave Mustaine is still dominating a lot of the more ambitious tracks, but here we see the four west coast thrashers doing a bit of their own work, and the results are nothing short of stellar.\n\nThis album was not received well by some core thrash fans because of a larger keyboard presence and a good deal of acoustic guitar work. It says something about the ears that these people possess as \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d off the demo also had a synthesizer in the intro, as well as an acoustic interlude. Suffice to say, the intros to \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d and \u201cCall of Ktulu\u201d have musical functions that don\u2019t involve compromising the genre of thrash. The former functions well as a deceptive device, is so divorced musically from the rest of the song that it\u2019s function is clear, and is developed a hell of a lot more than the redundant intro of \u201cBattery\u201d. The latter\u2019s intro is present throughout the song, functioning as it\u2019s primary theme.\n\nThe guitar work on here is nothing short of phenomenal. The intro riff of the title track, the various lead sections in \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d, and the intro riff to \u201cCreeping Death\u201d are highlights of this album. Kirk\u2019s solo on \u201cCall of Ktulu\u201d is one of the most insane technical display\u2019s I\u2019ve heard out of him, although it\u2019s outshined musically by his short yet riveting bursts on \u201cTrapped under Ice\u201d and his hauntingly ominous shred work on the title track. Kirk\u2019s melodic intro lead to \u201cFade to Black\u201d functions much better than any other slower work he\u2019s done since, and the acoustic lines represent a classic progression that essentially became synonymous with the Metallica ballad, and unfortunately was milked for all it was worth too many times on future releases.\n\nCliff Burton has an equal amount of display time on this album as he did on the previous release. His role as a support player dominates most of the faster songs on here, but he is given a great amount of time in the front during \u201cFor whom the bell tolls\u201d, particularly at the beginning. But his biggest and most ambitious work is observed during \u201cCall of Ktulu\u201d, where he shreds nearly as much as he did on \u201cAnesthesia\u201d, only now he has the full band behind him. There is also a good amount of character to his playing, as his wah pedal work almost sounds like the screams of an angry deity.\n\nHowever, despite all of the amazing moments mentioned before, the highlight of this album is \u201cTrapped under ice\u201d. This is about as thrash as it gets, between Kirk\u2019s short solo bursts and James\u2019 driving riffs, this is a song that could get you so worked up you\u2019ll start your own mosh pit. This one would pass as one of the faster tracks on the debut album, yet has the exceptional production of this one. There isn\u2019t a dull moment from start to finish, and when it\u2019s over, you\u2019ll be tempted to go back for another go.\n\nIf there is one weak link on this album, it\u2019s \u201cEscape\u201d, but it really isn\u2019t much of one. All in all, a good song with a somewhat NWOBHM feel to it. A lot of melodic material at work, and it\u2019s placement in the track order gives us a brief rest after the thrash cooker \u201cTrapped under ice\u201d and an almost equally faster and furious \u201cCreeping Death\u201d. If the guitars were a bit less aggressive sounding and the vocals were a bit more operatic, this could pass for an early Dickinson era Maiden track. It\u2019s a tiny bit out of place with Metallica, but still a good song.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are not a Metallica fan, this album is still highly recommended because it is one of the finest moments the thrash genre ever had. It\u2019s a bit more accessible than the debut for those of you whom are not fully inclined towards the thrash genre, but like melodic music with a fast pace. This album is a pinnacle of early 80s metal, and is a standard by which any thrash band should be measured against. Listening to it from start to finish is an experience comparable to the title, so get yourself to the local store, and be prepared to Ride the Lightning.\n",
        "\nMetallica really got going on these DVD/VHS concerts post black album, I guess it's a consequence of success. The idea of mixing metal with an orchestra is not really too far of a stretch, this was already being done to an extent in Europe since 1997 with Rhapsody, although I must say their music works with this set up alot better. But in the case of Metallica, this is certainly a hit or miss proposition, especially when considering the lack of decent studio albums in the past 8 years before this project.\n\nThe overall performance is not terrible, but James' vocals are not what they used to be, as was observed on the Load albums. Kirk is apparently using his wah pedal as much as ever, though at times his solos are drowned out by the bombastic orchestra hits. The orchestral arrangements are fairly interesting, owing to working with some real professionals in the field of large ensembles, something Metallica is essentially not up to doing themselves. (I studied orchestration at college, what these guys do takes alot of time and effort. I toiled for over a month, about 3 hours a day, to get a 3 minute composition arranged for full orchestra.)\n\nMy biggest complaint on this performance is many of the songs that were chosen. These songs fall into 2 categories, the first is songs that were not appropriate for this kind of venue due to the stylistic nature of the original version, the second are songs that are lousy and should not be performed period. \n\n\"Of Wolf and Man\" is one of the best songs off the Black Album, but it just doesn't work, that kind of gallop feel requires louder guitars that are not flooded with string and woodwind ambiences. \"Fuel\" is probably the second best song off the Load albums and is welcome at live performances, but the orchestra does not work with songs like these. \"Sad but true\" and \"Enter Sandman\" are both mediocre tracks from the Black Album and I can tolerate them, but especially in the case of the former, the orchestra takes away from the heaviness that gives these songs their strength. \"Devil's Dance\" falls into the same category as the two previous songs. \n\n\"The Outlaw Torn\" is a song that simply grates on my nerves, orchestra or no orchestra, I can't listen to it without feeling annoyed. \"The Thing that Should Not Be\" is another song that doesn't agree with me, and although the orchestra doesn't neccesarily clash with anything, the dryness of the song is not covered with some fancy violin fill-ins. \"Hero of the Day\" is a blight on Metallica's history, this is a St. Anger worthy track that was written 7 years too early, basically a trash can rolling contest with an orchestra in the background.\n\nThe rest of the music on here is well done for the most part. Surprise performances included, \"Bleeding Me\" and \"Until it Sleeps\" which actually sound much better on this than they did originally. \"The Memory Remains\" works fairly well, though it drags a bit amongst the better songs in the setlist. \n\nThe remaining MoP work on here pretty much gets the job done, I'm not really enthusiastic about further corrupting a thrash song like \"Battery\" with an orchestra to exacerbate an already out of place intro. \"Where Ever I may Roam\" fits this venue well, especially the introduction. \"One\" sounds good during the quiet sections, but turns to mush during the faster part of the song. \"For whom the Bell Tolls\" works extremely well here, especially the way the orchestra brings out the intro bass theme.\n\nBut the two best performances on this set go to \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Call of Ktulu\". The former works the best due to the original arrangement being well suited to this format, the latter is one that I personally thought would have been suited for this kind of thing had it been recorded later in their career. The new original track \"No Leaf Clover\" is well done musically, although the lyrics are a bit stupid.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a fairly decent job considering the time period that Metallica did it in. I think any Metallica fan who was able to tolerate the Black Album will find some good in it, but I'd suggest the core \"Kill Em' All\" and \"Ride the Lightning\" fans should probably not bother with this one. It comes recommended, but I'd personally suggest getting it second hand. I paid $5 for it, and I can't rationalize paying more than $7 for it.\n",
        "\nWell here it is ladies and gentlemen, Metallica\u2019s first album in 6 years, and they ended up exactly the way I thought they would. There is an old clich\u00e9 where someone states that a situation quote \u201cwould be funny if it weren\u2019t so sad\u201d. You know what, Metallica has actually broken new ground for once in the past 10 years, as they have succeeded in reversing this clich\u00e9 and created something so pathetic, so sad, and so horrible, that it is a full blown laugh fest. After spawning a whole generation of bastard thrash bands who all made their careers ripping off Master of Puppets, we are introduced to the new generation of Metallica\u2019s illegitimate progeny, mallcore. And in usual form, after helping bring these atrocious bands into existence, the former thrashers are seemingly falling over each other trying to join ranks with them. But ironically there is a silver lining to this album that I will get to later.\n\nBefore I proceed to pick apart the garbled mess of riffs and random thoughts from this cesspool of amateur produced noise, I have to take a moment to mention the unbelievably misleading and pretentious hype that was injected into this album by the critical field. Apparently it was review day for the hearing impaired and legally blind when the various news outlets compared this release to the thrash/doom classic \u201cAnd Justice for All\u201d. All you have to do is read the lyrics, or listen to the words if you don\u2019t have one, to understand how much of a far-cry this is from anything Metallica has ever released. And when you listen to the music, it sounds so contorted and ridiculous that you think your listening to a garage demo of Dillinger Escape Plan. Suffice to say, if I meet the idiot that thought to compare this with Justice, I\u2019ll be checking for the hearing aid and/or the seeing eye dog.\n\nAnd so we kick off this album with \u201cFrantic\u201d, and right away we know what is wrong, the guitars are a muddy mess and the drums are way too loud. There are actually some mildly interesting riffs in here, though they lie buried under a messy production. However, Hetfield\u2019s vocals are god awful, and the lyrics are ridiculous, to the point that the mallcore accusations become inevitable. Also note that at several instances on this track the guitar tracks are not in tune with each other. The title track \u201cSt. Anger\u201d follows and suffers from the same dilemma as the opener, although Hetfield\u2019s vocal performance is slightly better, despite being way to loud in the mix and having equally absurd lyrics. \u201cSome Kind of Monster\u201d is a complete throwaway track, way too long (this album\u2019s \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d) and extremely sloppy. This would have been a good song to keep Kirk\u2019s solos in, because it would have softened the blow a bit.\n\n\u201cDirty Window\u201d has one riff in it, and although it\u2019s half decent it\u2019s barely developed, making the song seem longer than it is, and also plagued by terrible sounding drums and a lousy vocal performance. \u201cInvisible Kid\u201d takes my pick for the worst song; the lyrics are absolutely awful, making the likes of Fred Durst and Stinkin\u2019 Park sound like poets. This song is also suffering from the Outlaw Torn Syndrome, only now Lars is banging on garbage can lids rather than a drum kit. The guitars and bass are an absolute muddy mess, but at least here they are a bit easier to hear, making this the second worst track on this lousy album. \u201cMy World\u201d is another song with one decent riff, although here there is a bit more changes, over some more idiotic mallcore sounding lyrics. The vocal tracks, at moments, get so over-loaded with reverb that they completely drown everything else out, not what I call a great idea. Oh yeah, did I mention that Lars\u2019 drums still sound horrible, to the point that he should\u2019ve probably use his higher toms as a snare, as it sounds much better when he\u2019s on them.\n\n\u201cShoot Me Again\u201d deserves special attention because it\u2019s obviously aimed at Metallica\u2019s growing number of detractors since the \u201cBlack Album\u201d. I would just like to state that no one needs to shoot these guys, nor has anyone, they\u2019ve shot themselves so many times that they\u2019ve become as holy as a 120 year old Tibetan monk. James literally sounds even more like a rapping mallcore poser than Robb Flynn on \u201cSupercharger\u201d. One positive of this song is that the drums have actually been turned down a bit; of course this makes little difference as the song is about the most non-dramatic, non-powerful, and non-metal one they\u2019ve ever released.\n\nOn a somewhat positive note, \u201cSweet Amber\u201d has a very bluesy sounding riff to it, and despite having an extremely muddy tone to it, actually isn\u2019t too bad. The fact that the drums have been seemingly toned down for the second half of this album helps this song greatly, in addition to being one of the shorter tracks on here. James\u2019 vocal performance has less ridiculous moments, an additional plus that unfortunately is extremely rare on this album. \u201cThe Unnamed Feeling\u201d is another over-long mishmash of random riffs, but thankfully the drums are still turned down. This song is highly forgettable, nothing overly horrible but nothing good, it\u2019s just simply there, taking up 7 minutes of space. \u201cPurify\u201d is the shortest song on here, and for good reason, it\u2019s slow as hell and drags any feeling of hope that this album has gotten any better since \u201cSweet Amber\u201d down completely. The over-loud, annoying trash can sounding drums are back again, as are James\u2019 stupid mallcore vocals. At this point they are literally killing this album until it dies from it.\n\nThe closing track on here \u201cAll Within my Hands\u201d is one of the better tracks on here, but also probably the most inconsistent. The drum level varies from being the usual loud mess, to actually dying down a bit to let the better moments of this song shine. It\u2019s way too long, James\u2019 vocal performance is hit or miss, but it escapes \u201cThe Outlaw Torn Syndrome\u201d by having some interesting moments during the middle of the song. Bear in mind the basis of comparison, of course, as this album is completely terrible.\n\nFor everyone wondering what the heck happened to Metallica here, I will state that given the circumstances surrounding the band and the lead up to this point in their career, this album is the best that it could\u2019ve been. I can not recommend it to anyone unless you are so sick that you\u2019re willing to listen to a band that is all but completely musically bankrupt try to sound heavy. If an album is bad, I tend not to bother with it, unless it\u2019s done by a band I love. But don\u2019t cry for these guys, express your outrage and pray that they get something in their heads rather than on them. People are not meant to be pitied, they are meant to be commended for getting off their asses and not letting the bad in life get them down. When they don\u2019t do this, and refuse to even try, it is best to either ridicule them or ignore them. I have done the former, and until I see something much better out of these guys, I will now proceed to do the latter.\n\nLater submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 10, 2009.\n",
        "\nBack in the early 80s there was a sort of war going on between various styles of metal, all of which are attributed to the NWOBHM. The war came down to what were the various bands of the scene going to specialize in. Were they going to go the all speed and energy route of Motorhead, were they going to take the mixed skills approach of Judas Priest or Riot, the musical intrigue of Iron Maiden and Angel Witch, or the lust and debachery of some of the other acts at the time who influenced the hair scene.\n\nIt was during this time that the genre known as Thrash metal was born, and it was all 100% unapologetically Motorhead influenced, although many of the bands in it took their more active bass cue from Sabbath, and the guitar solo sections from Deep Purple. From start to finish, Kill Em' All is a manifesto of sorts for this exact style of playing.\n\nUnlike Metallica's later and current material, there are actually songs on here that don't break the 5 minute mark, which is a definate plus. Too many bands nowadays seem to think that a song isn't good until it's over 12 minutes long, has a thousand changes in it, and consists of guitar solos that regularly break the 2 minute mark. There is such a thing as overdoing it, and thankfully at this time period Metallica understood that.\n\nThe greatest songs on here fall into 2 categories, the Mustaine Catalog, and the former Leather Charm material penned by James Hetfield.\n\nOf the latter, \"Motorbreath\" is lyrically stronger and has the live fast and stay true to yourself attitude that defines early Thrash. \"Hit the Lights\" has the edge in terms of riffs, particularly that amazing intro riff that kicks off after the freetime intro. The solos on this one are riveting, and perfectly suited for the venting style that Kirk Hammet always exhibits. Although Mustaine is 5 times the guitar player he is, he gets the job done nicely on here.\n\nDave Mustaine is responsible for 4 tracks on this album, which is quite alot considering he had been kicked out of the band at this point. It is understandable that he's been pissed off about what happened, seeing that Metallica basically got their asses off the ground by stealing his work. Of the material on here, \"Four Horsemen\" is obviously the most memorable, but the songs on here that would more define Metallica's early career would be \"Metal Militia\" and \"Phantom Lord\", both of which have riffs that be either paraphrased or actually copied (MoP's Disposable Heroes an example of the latter). \"Jump in the Fire\" is also quite excellent and displays the one time ever that Metallic would play a song in a non-open key, and thus makes the album sound a bit more varied and enjoyable to the more fine tuned ear than the play in E until you die and occasionally switch to F# approach that dominated the post RTL era.\n\nThe rest of the music on here is decent enough, but not quite as powerful as the stuff already mentioned. \"Seek and Destroyed\" features some great lead work by Kirk and has a very memorable opening riff, as well as some extremely hard to hear but interesting bass leads by Cliff Burton. \"No Remorse\" is loaded with riffs, but is a little bit too long and the tempo drags at times. \"Whiplash\" is a decent thrash tune, but the main riff sounds a tiny bit muddy. Mustaine's opening riff to Youthanasia's \"Reckoning Day\" is an example of a better version of this kind of rhythmic figure.\n\nThe outlier on this album is obviously Cliff's bass solo, dubbed \"Anesthesia\" (Pulling Teeth\". Technically it's quite a display, but unfortunately it's too long for it's own good and there are only 2 sections that really provide a dynamic contrast, and that is helped along by the drums entering. Joey Demaio did a much better job a year before this album with his rendition of the William Tell Overture, which was probably technically more difficult than this song is as well, though obviously it wasn't original.\n\nIn conclusion, this album lives on what defined early thrash, speed and attitude. This unfortunately is not found on any other album by this band save \"Ride the Lightning\" and, at times, \"And Justice for all\". This is the uncorrupted, uncompromised, true face of Thrash metal. Bang your fucking head till your ears bleed and enjoy!\n",
        "\nIn recent years, after the plunge of this band into being a complete caricature of what is wrong with music today, everyone began to wonder what went wrong, why did this band turn into a walking satire. I myself had my own theories about it as I penned reviews for the substandard Load albums and began a rather painful listening session of \u201cSt. Anger\u201d. I happened upon some rather scathing reviews of this album as being the death of metal/a corruption in the fabric that resulted in the death of thrash. On top of this, I\u2019ve read some rather nostalgic, yet somewhat apologetic and weak defenses of this album.\n\nAs some may have gleaned, I am a guitar player who is currently co-fronting a power metal band with some symphonic influences, but what is not mentioned there is that my first introduction into heavy metal was in the realm of thrash, particularly MegaDeth\u2019s \u201cPeace Sells\u201d album. I was 13 years old at the time and I was just starting to learn guitar with Nirvana as my primary influence, but my brother was liquidating his own stock of old audio cassettes and I ended up with a mountain of 80s metal albums, the two main ones were Metallica\u2019s \u201cAnd Justice for All\u201d and MegaDeth\u2019s \u201cPeace Sells\u201d. The latter received the most attention from me, although the former was very well received. Fairly soon after, Kurt Cobain shot himself, I realized that his music was an artistic dead-end and I began learning how to actually play my instrument.\n\nI had never thought of reviewing this album because truth be told, I have not listened to it in years. I bought this album in 1994 because everyone in my high school guitar class told me it was Metallica\u2019s masterpiece, so I went to the store and picked it up on CD. \"Kill Em\u2019 All\", \"Ride The Lightning\", and \"And Justice For All\" all receive regular play in my stereo, and occasionally I do listen to the self-titled album. But for some reason, though I didn\u2019t chalk it up to not liking the album at the time, I just had other things to listen to, so I just didn't see it as that important musically. On an intuition, I picked it up again and after listening to this album 10 times through, over a course of 4 days during some long commutes, I figured out where the dissent I had encountered was coming from.\n\nOne of the things I did during these listening sessions was re-learn all of the lead riffs and the solos, which are not all that technically or musically intricate actually. Kirk Hammet\u2019s best solos on this album are the ones on \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d and \u201cBattery\u201d, and they are good primarily because they are geared towards what Kirk has always been good at, venting anger through fast and repetitive pentatonic licks and scale runs. His more melodic solos on \u201cSanitarium\u201d are extremely anti-climactic, as was the case with his lead work on \u201cTo Live Is To Die\u201d, and sound more forced than anything else. All of the rest of his material is highly forgettable, because they are too long winded and localized to one spot. Kirk\u2019s solos are best when split up into smaller doses and spread out through out the song in short bursts. When they are long-winded and done over a constantly repeated drone, it sounds like some shred kid doing basic pentatonic calisthenics rather than something musical. It is also important to note that this album is where Kirk is beginning to use the wah pedal as a crutch rather than an effect to complement some of his solos, and the result is his current overuse of it.\n\nThe main riffs of these songs are highly memorable, too memorable in fact, and this is where an accusation is raised about this album being a bunch of fluff and fodder for public consumption stems from. One of the reasons for this is that the riffs are played over and over ad nauseum. This can be readily observed in the intros to \u201cBattery\u201d, the title track, \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d, \u201cSanitarium\u201d, as well as the main riffs of \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d and \u201cDamage Inc.\u201d There are a good number of differing riffs and parts in each track, but all of them are repeated far too much and not developed at all. The \"Black Album\" at least attempted to vary the rhythm riffs, here there is absolutely no attempt being made. Back during the war in Afghanistan it was rumored that the Allied military was using Metallica\u2019s music to extract information from prisoners, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they used some of this album, because parts of it turn into sheer torture on the ears during repeated listens, to the point of it becoming musical propaganda. It screams \u201cthese are great riffs, and you will hear them over and over until you agree with me!!!\u201d.\n\nThe intros of all the mainstream friendly songs, minus perhaps \u201cOrion\u201d, are all geared towards one purpose, hiding the true nature of what Metallica is, a thrash band. None of the intros in the more thrashing songs that have them are brought back, making it sound like your listening to 2 completely different songs. There is something to be said for the idea that these intros are meant to suck in non-metal fans and boost album sales, but there is a deeper musical emotion at work than the pretense of greed, and that is shame. It is not a question of having soft intros to loud songs, many great bands do this effectively and \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d is an example of Metallica doing it right, but it\u2019s a matter of having intros for the sake of having them, with no other purpose than to act as window dressing to make what comes after not seem as heavy, as aggressive, as fucking metal. \n\nMetallica has truly taken the road of self-parody, and this is readily observable in the structure of these songs. A good analogy, if anyone here is a novel buff, is the practice in architecture of setting up ornamentation and figurehead statues to hide the actual structure itself in Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d. The result is the articulation of shame over the goodness of your work, and ultimately the death of the art save the individuals whom rebel against the trend. This is exactly what happened in the early 90s in Metal, and the result was the worst possible band taking over the reins of heavy music, Nirvana. If you haven\u2019t read \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d, I recommend reading it because it explains exactly how not only in architecture, but in every art it is guilt over your own greatness that destroys it.\n\nI\u2019m going to personally take a moment to single out \u201cThe Thing That Should Not Be\u201d because quite frankly this is one of the worst attempts to re-capture the slower doom sound of Sabbath that I\u2019ve ever heard. The intro riff is gloomy and dark sounding enough, but the rest of the song is so slow, over-long, redundant and boring that you almost want to yank the CD out of the player and crush it inside your own fist. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that this album has the old punch sound in the guitar that Metallica used to exhibit regularly, this song would almost sound like a slightly more organized version of \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d.\n\nThe lyrics of this album are a perfect reflection of the propaganda like nature of the musical structure, be it the tired \"just say no to drugs\" theme in the title track, the weak willed words against televangelism in \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d, the collectivist spirit of \u201cSanitarium\u201d, or the clich\u00e9 post 60s anti-war rehash of \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d. But the important aspect of these songs is not the politics, but the underlying principle that causes one to take up these various pet causes and to turn your music into a slave of established and self-contradictory political ideologies, and that is the desire to have your music seem important for the sake of being important to others. Music is an art that is independent of the listener, the listener is drawn to it because of it\u2019s nature, not because it panders to what the listeners may or may not agree with. This is where the line is drawn between true art and propaganda disguised as art, and the lion\u2019s share of this album is the latter, not the former which could describe the works before this.\n\nIf there is any saving grace to this album, it is the things that I did not mention. Despite being overlong and essentially being an idea stolen from Dave Mustaine\u2019s past work in Metallica, \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d is a decent song and can be extracted from the rest of the mediocrity on this album. \u201cOrion\u201d is actually a good instrumental and highlights the strength of Cliff Burton\u2019s post-Sabbath influence on the band, one that was sadly lost after his death. \u201cDamage Inc.\u201c is a good song, even though the structure is thrown off a bit by the intro. And if you ignore the redundant and flat sounding acoustic intro to \u201cBattery\u201d, you have a song very similar to \u201cBlackened\u201d, but if you can\u2019t do this, just listening to the opening track to \u201cAnd Justice for All\u201d will suffice. \n\nAs far as what the socio-cultural impact of this album was on the greater metal scene, I would like to add a few things as to how this album succeeded in doing what it did, and why it\u2019s impact was delayed. In 1986 thrash was still alive and kicking. Nuclear Assault had just hit the scene, Anthrax would be poised to release a set of decent albums, and MegaDeth was still pumping out classic albums. As far as the death of thrash goes, MegaDeth\u2019s \u201cPeace Sells\u201d was the primary delay in it\u2019s demise. As far as the death of the entire metal movement in the early 90s, this was caused in part by the acceptance of this corrupt form of thrash by most of the metal faithful, but it was helped by a lot of other circumstances, and also delayed by some stellar releases.\n\nJudas Priest had probably their least heavy release in 1986, but in 1988 their classic speed and shred based \u201cRam it Down\u201d provided a NWOBHM alternative to the disease that was slowly festering in the Thrash scene, and this was followed by the even more fast and fierce \u201cPainkiller\u201d. Also, Iron Maiden released their greatest album in \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d the same year as this album was released, and followed it up by an ingenious concept album in \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d. Unfortunately, the self-destruction of these bands due to conflicts between the front men and the others left a vacuum to be filled by the first person with an ounce of angst in him, and that is how we ended up with Kurt Cobain, who basically filled a complete artistic vacuum with a nihilistic/anarchistic punk rock sound that was so self-parodying, even compared to this album, that it\u2019s seemingly premature demise was inevitable.\n\nAlso note, Yngwie was still cranking out classics even after the death of metal in America and keeping others outside the states interested, despite being labeled as has been and being ridiculed by these closeted sausage hounds in the 90s thrash scene. If anything, Yngwie has as much of a brief against this album as all in the Thrash community, because his image and style of playing was what came under direct assault in the early 90s as a result of it. The darker metal that was influenced by Merciful Fate and others pioneering the occult side of metal were always underground, and they did well to survive this disease and are still going with their integrity intact. \n\nNo my friends, Metallica did not kill metal with this album, but they made it so sick and decrepit that it had to disappear in order to heal from the wounds inflicted on it by this virus. What this album did to metal, however, is not the reason for the low score. The reason is that this is a sub-standard and mediocre release that came from a band that was far more capable than this, and the only danger threatened by it is accepting it as being better than what it actually is. I personally am not interested in dwelling upon the past of metal, I am more interested in it\u2019s future, and it does not lie with this album, nothing great is influenced by anything mediocre. To those of you aspiring metal bands out there who want to do something great, steer clear of this release. I had a long talk with all the members of my band and we have all agreed that this album is one that will not impact our music in any way, shape or form.\n\nLater submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on August 20, 2008.\n",
        "\nMetallica has been on a steady track towards complete artistic death since the early 90s, this much is obvious. When listening to the tainted fruits of the labor of a band that used to be worth a damn, we must consider the history that spawned the corruption. Although there is a good case to be made that it's origins lie before the Black Album in the mid 80s, it's symptoms did not come about until the Black Album, particularly the tour that supported it.\n\nBeing on the road for 4 years plus to support a single album is absolutely ridiculous, I don't care if it's Metallica's self-titled fifth album, or Iron Maiden's Killers (The only album I might be able to make excuses for resulting in a tour this long). Not only do you lose time better spent on writing more music, but you also confound the lines between what truly matters in heavy metal. You begin to see the crowd as some omnipotent collective that makes the music possible, and this is as far from the truth as it gets. \n\nFans do not create heavy metal, they are not the cause, they are the consequence. The people who created heavy metal were the artists who toiled over their guitars, basses, and drum kits creating something amazing, something that no one had ever done before. The fans came because they saw great music, something so great that their bodies were forced to move to it violently, to shout out the lyrics and try to overshadow the people they were idolizing, and ultimately, to pick up an instrument and to do it even better.\n\nBeing on the road and touring on your music is one of the greatest things in the world, every time I play a live show I feel a euphoria that nothing else could come close to. However, you don't tour without having something to tour on, something great to make it worth it first to yourself, and then to those whom will come to see you. Metallica forgot this while on the road living the good life, they forgot that what created the music that the audience loves was introspection, and that does not happen on the road.\n\nHow does all this relate to this album, this 2nd rate modern rock garbage that is passed off as metal? This album, along with it's predecessor, was written while on the long ass, 4 years plus, Black Album tour. In 4 years, in between concerts and alcohol binges, Metallica created 2 and 1/2 hours of mediocrity as a substitute for true heavy metal.\n\nThis album, dubbed \"Reload\", is essentially a B-side collection of songs that didn't make it onto \"Load\". From this first fact we learn both that Metallica has actually done something original, create a sequel to something that is actually slightly better than it's predecessor. Consequently, we also learn that Metallica can't tell the difference between bad songs and collections of quasi-good songs. This album actually rocks harder than Load, and has better songs, though to keep the context clear I am comparing this album to an absolute load of shit (no pun intended).\n\nUnfortunately, like the first Load album, only half of the songs here are actually listenable, and of those only a handful are enjoyable. \"Better than you\" is essentially a better version of \"Ain't my bitch\" that has stronger riffs and better lyrics, although James' voice is still a shadow of it's former self. \"Fuel\" has some decent riffs in it, rocks hard and moves fairly quickly, and James' voice is actually sounding quasi-masculine. \"Devil Dance\" is a slow, heavy, evil sounding track that actually reminds a bit of the slower tracks of the later 80s, though the guitars don't have the punch they used to. \"The Unforgiven 2\" is essentially a set of recycled riffs from both it's name sake on the Black Album and \"Fade to Black\", the goal was obviously to have an atmospheric equivalent of \"Until it Sleeps\", although it's been done before, it towers above most of the other crap on here. \n\nThe highlight of this album, ironically, is the most popular one. \"The Memory Remains\" has a good set of riffs, many of them borrowed from other bands, which is essentially the approach that defined the original thrash sound of their early work. I can hear bits and pieces of \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" here mixed in with \"God of Thunder\" by Kiss. This is the one track where Kirk's leads actually sound half decent, mostly due to the use of the wah pedal to clean up the choppy Neil Young sound he's adopted. Although it must be stated that both of the Load albums suffer from something else that the Black Album suffered from, overuse of the wah pedal.\n\nThe rest of this album is mostly a giant pile of musical debris, and of these only two merited a full listen through. \"Low Man's Lyric\" is hailed by proponents of this album as another brilliant innovation by the \"New Metallica\". NONSENSE! RUBBISH! POPPYCOCK! Throwing together a 3rd rate country tune and throwing in a violin is not original, I don't care if Metallica does it or if Garth Brooks does it. \"Fixxer\" is listenable, but suffers from The Outlaw Torn Syndrome, a rare disorder where you have an extremely loose and sloppy performance that meanders around long enough to induce either deep sleep or a drop in intelligence.\n\nThat's right ladies and gentlemen, Metallica successfully released a whole album where after the first 5 tracks, you have nothing but pure crap. Instead of naming this album \"Reload\" they should have named it \"Prematurely blowing your Load\", and swapped the album cover from the first Load to underscore the fact. But you know what, it's all fine and dandy because Metallica is back on tour now and we can all go and see them play live and hopefully they'll play some of their older stuff. After all, touring is the only thing Metallica cares about now, as evident to their complete refusal to get the job done in the studio. Maybe next time they'll stop fucking around and go the whole 9 yards and just do farewell tours the way Barbara Streisand does.\n\nAs was the case with \"Load\" this album represents the 2nd step down into the depths of irrelevance. It has some moments, but they represent a total time length of 26 minutes out of nearly an hour and 1/2 worth of music. Between these two albums we have 9 tracks equaling roughly 50 minutes of music, about the average time length of Metallica's early releases. If I had been managing Metallica at this point of their career, I would have combined the 9 decent tracks between these two piles of excrement into one album, dropped the utterly stupid cover arts, and the album titles. For the new album cover I'd use the goofy picture of the band in Pimp outfits and smoking cigars from the back of the first Load, and the new title would be taken from the song \"Better than You\", both the cover and the title would be symbolic of the arrogance this band has carried with them throughout their career. Then I'd write a review for it here, and it would score a 72, and still be described as a step down from the Black Album. Think it's a good idea? I did it 6 years ago as my first ever CD rip attempt, I accomplished the cover by taping the back picture of the Load album to a piece of printer paper and doodling the new track list on the back in pen. Suffice to say, I listen to it on occasion, and it's a lot less painful than listening to what was originally released.\n",
        "\nMetallica has always been an over-rated band for as long as I've known of them. Now granted, this is a relative term which applies to many good bands out there, and it denotes over-stating the importance of something. There was a time when this band stood amongst a proud group of thrash acts, but even then, they didn't really stand out that much. They've written some good songs, even a couple of great ones, but they have never given me the urge (the way other band have) to scream out loud \"Are we fucking having fun yet!!!\" feeling I get when listening to Anthrax or MegaDeth.\n\nFollowing the lackluster yet still riff driven Black Album, and way too much time touring, Metallica entered the studio with a demon hanging over them. Not the kind that drives you to bang your head like a maniac, but the kind that fills you with guilt over the fact that you just recorded an album that was less than what you were capable of and succeeded in gaining a fame that you didn't deserve. The ultimate consequence of letting this demon into your life is the stench of mediocrity and ultimately, self-destruction.\n\nWe kick off this album with \"Ain't my Bitch\", while it does rock hard, it is evidently clear that James' voice is shot and that the guitar has all but completely lost it's punch. Furthermore, it is revealed to us here that Kirk's solos have turned into a choppy mess more befitting of Neil Young (the undisputed worst lead player ever) than Iommi or Blackmore. \"2x4\" is a boring, redundant, recycled, quasi-Hendrix sounding riff played over and over for 5 1/2 minutes. \"The House Jack Built\" is a slower and even more boring rock song that actually forced me to hit the skip button before it was half over. This is probably the most awful start to an album by a metal band I've encountered.\n\n\"Until it Sleeps\" sees Metallica regaining a bit of their edge by going the atmospheric route, and although it reminds a bit of \"The Unforgiven\", Kirk's lead prove that the still apple fell a bit too far this time. \"King Nothing\" has remnants of some of the better riffs of the previous album, but the lyrics are so cliche that they grate on the nerves. \"Hero of the Day\" takes my pic for the worst song on here, and I listened to it all the way through because it was so bad that it stopped being painful and became a bit funny. The guitar is so muddy during the loud parts and the drums are so poorly produced that it almost sounds like a few dozen trash cans being dropped out a 4 story building at random intervals. Don't even get me started on the idiotic lyrics or the goofy intro guitar theme.\n\nProbably the only song on here that I can say I enjoyed on here is \"Bleeding Me\", which reminds a bit of some elements of \"And Justice for All\", though without the punch in the guitars. The only flaw I can really attribute to this song (besides the ones already mentioned as being present on the whole album) is that it's too long.\n\nThe next three songs are complete and utter garbage. Terms like filler are too kind to describe a bunch of 2nd rate hard rock tunes from a band that should be doing major damage to your neighbor's hearing. Led Zepplin's \"4\" has more punch than this crap. Furthermore, botching the drum sound on the production and then putting in a drum intro is the perfect way to annoy the hell out of anyone (reference to the intro to \"Cure\").\n\nOnce we get past that last trilogy of excrement, we arrive at \"Mama Said\", which would be a semi-decent ballad with a loud ending if it weren't for that stupid, annoying country style lead during the chorus. Some people get this ridiculous idea into their heads that if a metal band plays something non-metal that it's suddenly something completely new. NEWSFLASH! There is nothing in this song that is claimed to be innovative that wasn't either done 26 years ago by Led Zepplin or 10 years before that by Johnny Cash's back up musicians.\n\n\"Thorn Within\" and \"Ronnie\" are two more throwaway tracks, which paves the way to the long-winded, under-developed, and way too repetitive \"The Outlaw Torn\". Probably one of the sloppiest songs I've ever heard, both in terms of performance and overall production.\n\nMetallica fell pretty far here, owing mostly to things that began to show themselves during the Black Album. It hasn't completely malformed itself into something that merits crushing the CD under your boot, but there aren't many redeeming moments on here. The album cover features a visual by some wackjob, who thinks himself an artist, who mixed cow blood with his own semen. This is quite appropriate as this album sounds like it was thrown together over a weekend and passed off as something new and innovative. To put it plainly, Bull Shit.\n",
        "\nMetallica has been known as a band that doesn't do anything half-way, when they commit to a certain sound, they basically take it to it's full and final conclusion. So when they were taken under the wing of \"pop-rock\" producer and so-called star-maker (yawn) Bob Rock, they essentially dropped their former thrashy ways the way a space shuttle would it's booster rockets. Let me state for the record that I am a fan of many of the bands Bob Rock produced, but the way of thinking that he functions under and applies to an album's format, I can not condone.\n\nThe black album is exactly what it was meant to be, an appeal to a different audience than the one Metallica has associated with during the rest of their career. Whether one wishes to label this as \"disloyalty\" or \"artistic liberty\" is not important, but what is important is the music resulting from the change. Needless to say, the riffs and the spirit are still present, but the progressive and complex elements that originally gave Metallica it's unique edge on previous efforts has been scrapped.\n\nThe production on this album is nothing short of amazing. The drums, in particular, are loud and thunderous. Sometimes the snare hit is so powerful that I can feel my bones rattle. The bass is a loud, solid grind that will make the floor of your house shake even with the volume on 4 out of 10. The guitars have an extremely aggressive attack and a long sustain, the rhythm guitar tracks in particular are spot on. The vocals are clear, crisp, and clearly have been redone dozens of time in order to grab that sense of perfection they carry on here.\n\nThe songwriting on this album is where things start to look a bit weak. We don't have anything on this album that can be considered thrash, or anything fast enough to be considered worthy of banging your head to. \"Through the Never\", the fastest song on here, is far too slow to have even made it onto \"Kill em\" All\" and probably would have been considered down tempo on \"Master of Puppets\". The guitar riffs are mostly quite good, but they are repeated far too much and varied far too little. The worst offenders in this category are \"Enter Sandman\", \"Sad but True\", \"Don't Tread on me\", and \"The God that Failed\". The bass and drum lines sound quite watered down (although \"My Friend of Misery\" give Newstead a chance to shine) and don't really leave a lasting impression. \n\nIn addition to the songwriting, it is neccesary to take into account how each musician performed on this album, which involves a bit of overlap with the riffs that they play. \n\nHetfield - Ironically this album is where Hetfield showcases some of his most brilliant rhythm work. \"Where Ever I May Roam\" and \"Of Wolf and Man\" are two of the best main riffs I've heard out of the band to date. Another ironic thing is that although \"Nothing Else Matters\" is a bit too repetitive lyrically for me to qualify it as an amazing ballad, the acoustic work on here is very intriguing, and out of all the solos on here, the one James plays on this track displays an emotional element that Kirk lacks on every solo he plays.\n\nUrlich - His drum sound is well produced, but his beats on this album are dry and too damn slow. His fills are mostly slight variations on the actual beat itself. He does give us some rather neat sounding military beats on \"Struggle Within\", and his fills on \"Nothing Else Matters\" are quite powerful.\n\nNewstead - Needless to say, Jason's role on this album is 95% atmospheric and support work. \"Enter Sandman\" and \"Sad but True\" are perfect examples of the patience that Jason has, as I would be bored to tears playing these basslines all the way through. His bass intros on \"My friend of Misery\" and \"The God that Failed\", as well as his short time alone on \"Holier than Thou\" are the only times where his presence is really of knowable consequence, although without his bass work this album would be as thin sounding as \"Justice\" was, and without the awesome drum work to save it.\n\nHammet - In my opinion Hammet has always been the weak link in Metallica, his solos are highly forgettable, with the exception of most of the work he did on the various ballads that appeared on the last 4 albums. However, I would enjoy these solos while they were playing, and would take notice when they did. Here we have very few solos that rise above the realm of pentatonic wankery. His best work on here is probably the solos of \"Where Ever I may Roam\", the slow portion of \"The Unforgiven\" and the wah pedal work done on \"My friend of Misery\". One additional complaint I would like to add about this album is the overuse of the wah pedal. At least half of the songs on the album have it, that's a bit too much.\n\nThe songs contained within this album basically fall into 3 categories, those which are stand-out songs (the best), those which are good but inconsistent (moderately good), and those which are too repetitive (not bad, but below average by metal standards). Here are the songs that fall into these respective catagories.\n\nStand Out - \"Where Ever I May Roam\", \"Through the Never\", \"Of Wolf and Man\", \"My Friend of Misery\", and \"Struggle Within\".\n\nGood yet Inconsistent - \"Holier than Thou\", \"Don't Tread on Me\", \"Nothing Else Matters\", \"The God that Failed\".\n\nToo Repetitive - \"Enter Sandman\", Sad but True\", and \"The Unforgiven\"\n\nIn conclusion, this album suffers from the fact that it's creators spent too much time thinking about what others think of them. Rather than taking the self-made route that most metal bands with credibility take, or the more expedient yet equally respectable route of finding a producer that is completely like-minded and will meet you on your terms, Metallica chose to hire someone with a different set of values than theirs. The result is a compromise between two completely different worlds, ones that are not compatable with each other. When metal tries to go mainstream, it becomes pop, which is itself a form of music that is not neccesarily defined by how it sounds timbre wise but in that it orients itself completely to what others think of it. Be it the conformist music of teeny boppers like Britney Spears or the even more pathetic fashionable non-conformist music of most mainstream rock. It's adherent artists have no real musical identity of their own, and although this album represents an only slightly corrupted version of what they used to be, soon after this the disease would spread until eventually the only thing resembling heavy metal still possessed by Metallica is James Hetfield's bad attitude.\n",
        "\nMaster of Puppets truly is an exceptional album. As a musical piece of art it hardly sets any superior standards never seen before, neither does it really exceed the standards set by its contemporaries. Moreover, the teeth of time have not been too kind to it. But it holds a special place in metal history for its commercial success and fame. Yes, an album can become legendary simply because it becomes legendary. At some point on the path to fame, a positive feedback sets in, and the album turns from a new favourite into a phenomenon. It's relatively rare in metal, but it happened to MoP. It isn't necessarily the album's own fault.\n\nSomehow, for some people, it has become a fashion of sorts to attack Master of Puppets and claim it's a commercial sell-out, a bad album, undeserving of its fame, or even, amusingly, the death of heavy metal. If a single album can kill a genre, the genre was too weak to live in the first place. It may be that Master of Puppets is not the creative apex in the history of metal, nor the apex of Metallica themselves. I certainly don't consider it the best album ever. That questionable honour goes to, you guessed it, The Sane Asylum. But MoP sure isn't an inherently bad album, and probably its main faults lie in its relatively easy accessibility, in the way it gave a million metal laymen something a bit stringy but tantalizingly delicious to chew on in the mid 80's, and in its subsequent commercial success. I don't generally like the attacks on Puppets, unless the attack is based on solid reasoning. Just the fact that it sold millions of copies doesn't turn MoP into an album by Europe, and much more thought and arguments are needed before I can silently accept the downplaying of its importance. Neither is the fact that its ideas, song structures and sound have been imitated by gazillions of garage bands a reason to say it blows. On the contrary.\n\nEverybody has heard the album. Or, more like it, everybody should have heard the album, there may be a minority of 6 to 8 percent here so far without the experience. There's no need to describe the sound, it is the definitive 80's metal sound. It must suffice to say that as certainly as the riffing became the model for many a guitarist in his garage, the Metallica sound became an equally revered goal for the producers. The effect of MoP can be easily heard in the production of mainstream metal until the mid 90's.\n\nThe songs are familiar to almost everybody, at least the songs Master of Puppets, Orion and Sanitarium, the three musketeers of overplayed metal. Master of Puppets is a work of truly monolithic stature, and I bet only a few works by Iron Maiden can challenge it's familiarity, as far as complete albums go, to such a a large portion of the users of the Archives. The Master riff alone is instantly recognizable, and Damage Inc is quite probably the fastest thing on any rock or metal album ever to sell over five million copies.\n\nMaybe one of the most important things that turned the album into such a hit were the mellow parts. The whole Sanitarium actually becomes quite hard for the late 80's consumers of Def Leppard and Wet Wet Wet before it ends, but does it with stealth; many Madonna and Miami Vice fans didn't realize the gradual transition to metal, and would not have accepted Sanitarium as a nice song if they had only heard the end. The slower parts in Master of Puppets itself and Orion were, for some reason, often considered the album's real feats of musicianship by people who think becoming a metal artist equals trying to cover the lack of musical talent with excessive noise. Oh, the irony! Hetfield plays half an hour with his fingers bleeding, and Joe Sixpack thinks he was at his best during those moments that must have saved Ulrich from several looming heart attacks on live gigs. The mellowness turned the MoP into an effective gateway drug; there, on a thrash album, were parts that were easy and peaceful enough to be enjoyed by the guy from the street, slow and beautiful, but still ominous enough to tempt a dark-minded minority deeper into the album. MoP moulded millions from standard pulp into metalheads, and it did that by offering some sugar-coated bits, still attached to music that held within the essence and barbed hooks of metal, and reeled them in after the prey swallowed the lure. \n\nI can't remember where I was when I heard about the Kennedy assassination. It must have something to do with the fact that my father was about fifteen years old at the time, and I was not to be born for another eight years. I was probably eating in a local McDonalds when I heard of the September 11th attacks, but I'm not 100% sure; a friend of mine says it's correct, though. What I am sure of is that I was sitting on a bus on a smaller road parallel to the road currently bearing the number 25 in Finland, right next to the Koverhar steel plant, on my way home from school when I heard Metallica for the first time. The song was Master of Puppets itself, and it was an exhilarating, confusing sonic blast. The bus driver, probably something like thirty or forty years old, and as far from a metalhead as anyone without a walker can be, had the radio on, and there it was, in the middle of the easy-listen radio show, a ruthless piece of thrash. I had some Deep Purple, Rainbow, Dio and Twisted Sister on crappy copied tapes, and I was a 15-year old nerd trying to find my place on the field of music, mostly leaning towards hard rock and metal already, but still soft and very impressionable. Metallica was truly something new, and it hit me like a ton of feathers, not necessarily knocking me out, but overwhelming and obscuring the rest of the world for a while. And that, people, was the magic of Metallica. It was mainstream enough to be heard by virtually everybody, yet aggressive and different enough to lure malleable young souls like me into the world of metal. Master of Puppets was the favourite gateway drug of the 80's metal, and it sold furiously.\n\nIt took a few days more before I heard Battery, and within a couple of weeks my friend had the Master of Puppets on vinyl. It was a curiosity, an album to be approached with extreme caution, and didn't really stick on my skin until a few months later. But it was different and, at the time, merciless. That year was probably the best metal year of the whole 1980's, and no matter what Metallica's current street value is, Master of Puppets was an essential part of that very year. Two years later I was a handsome, long-haired thrash Hercules with a beutifully matured and muscularly symmetric body, and MoP had played an important part in the incredible transformation from a tapeworm-colored 70-pound nerd into the beautiful (and largely fictional) mosh-Jesus.\n\nAll right, I admit, the music is what it is, and all of it hasn't aged well. The thrash parts -Battery, Master of Puppets, Disposable Heroes and Damage Inc- do not sound nearly as furious anymore as they did back then. Sanitarium's melodic progression from half-acoustic mellowness to mellow thrashiness had already been seen on Ride the Lightning in the form of Fade to Black, and would be seen again as One on the next album. The Thing That Should Not Be has never really worked for me, except for the lyrical content, and Leper Messiah is a curious attempt at doing something else. Orion, unfortunately, is the specific song on the album that crosses the line and becomes too accessible in its prolonged repetitiveness, and ends up being the only metal intrumental known by approximately 68 million people with otherwise minimal knowledge of metal outside Aerosmith and Van Halen. Yes, you know what I mean, and yes, I know Aerosmith and Van Halen are not metal, but They don't. Also, the aforementioned production has suffered an immense drop in respect, just because it was copied by everybody for a decade and sounds aged for that sole reason alone. But look back at the times when MoP was young, try to remember where you were, and conjure an image of the effect it had. 1986 was the year of Chernobyl, the Olof Palme murder and the Challenger explosion. Do those ring any bells?\n\nI think most of the people who say they dislike MoP were still building sandcastles or learning not to wet their beds in 1986. And honestly, I don't really blame them. I've had a lot of trouble in learning to appreciate the music from the ancient times before I turned 10. Black Sabbath is a prime example of this: I recognize a dozen or so songs, but find none of them really worth my time. Iron Man gives me a rash and makes me restless and irritated, and that drunken, off-key feminine \"\u00d6y Yeeh!\" in the beginning of that one song is stupid enough make me blush for Ozzy. But I still won't deny the band's influence or value. We would all be listening to elevator muzak pan flute synth versions of The Beatles if it weren't for them. Yup, Alphaville would have claimed a two-inch space on YOUR CD shelf without Black Sabbath. And the songs aren't bad, they are just... old, and they've been remade ten thousand times since. And that's the problem with younger people's ideas about Master of Puppets; everything on the album has been done again three thousand times since. But, remember, only a few times before it. And those few times were witnessed by just a tiny handful of people, before the albums gradually became recognized long after Master of Puppets had sold a million copies.\n\nMaster of Puppets taught an important lesson to the mindless masses of the mainstream hard rock and heavy metal crowd of the time. The lesson was simple: appreciate the Riff. That was the odd blast I had when I first heart the title track: the main riff, no matter if and from whom it was originally stolen, was something new, and the basic construction, the very essence of thrash, would be repeated many times over on the album itself. There were riffs before. Many bands certainly made equally or even more riff based metal already before Ride the Lightning. I'm not saying anything to the effect that Metallica invented riffs, or thrash riffs (or even their own riffs, for that matter). But Master of Puppets was the first riff-driven thrash metal album ever heard by the ignorant masses. That in itself is the defining achievement of the album, its claim to fame. Everybody knows it: you, me, the metalhead next door, the 30 years old nicely C-cupped secretary in your dad's office and that pale skinny guy handing you the fries on the drive-through (or, alternatively, receiving them from you). Try to explain something about Artillery's Fear of Tomorrow or Dark Angel's Darkness Descends to those people, and you get the same \"get out of here, you untidy weirdo\" look you'd give a flaming indie movie buff trying to tell you about the newest art movie with sexual minority cowboys eating quiche; it isn't familiar, so it's bound to be less interesting. And if the same movie freak at the same time makes the mistake of saying that The Last Boyscout is worthless mainstream junk of questionable entertainment value, you'd certainly punch the dweeb, right? Connoisseurs can have their opinions, but the great public knows and -surprisingly- tolerates MoP quite well. It is the defining habit of the snob to say that the things loved by normal people are crap. I've tried to avoid that at all costs: I like cooking and well-made food, imported ales and occasionally prefer certain european movies to their US counterparts. But I've also told my friends to bitch-slap me hard and repeatedly if I ever say no to a case of finnish lager, an ice hockey game and three bags of potato chips with chicken wings attached.\n\nOne of the stupid ideas certain types of people seem to love is trying their damnest to find hidden meanings and deeper ideas in mainstream works. Usually this overanalyzing takes place after everything really relevant has already been said. A while ago Master of Puppets was still included in the Wikipedia's list of concept albums; it seems to have been deleted now, and rightly so. The album's own entry used to contain the goofy interpretation. This is supposed to be a concept album exploring the idea of control, an esoteric and multifaceted puppet master, and even Orion is an alleged study on the use of power, because Orion in the ancient legends did some stupid stuff. Bollocks, I say. I will leave proving this amusing hypothesis wrong as an excercise to the reader. An inductive proof can probably be found simply by writing two dozen words on little pieces of paper. Use big blanketing words like \"power\", \"corruption\", \"progression\", \"chaos\" and \"control\". Be creative. Then blindfold yourself, draw one of the words out of the pile and an album from your collection at random, and spent fifteen minutes composing an essay to prove the chosen album is a concept album exploring the Big Word in question. Like, say, the word \"religion\" and the album Here Comes Trouble by Scatterbrain. It can be done, and in a convincing manner, just believe me if you can't be bothered to try.\n\nErm... Okay, I'll admit, it cannot be done with \"religion\" and Here Comes Trouble. But you get the idea. This piece of work is roughly equal in its concept album quotient to every single album released in 1986.\n\nIt seems that we have a young, eager generation of metalheads that have been brought up with the idea that Ulrich's first name is actually supposed be spelled Lar$. All right, maybe his bright-eyed and childishly idealistic opposition to Napster and other actions, not to mention the sub-par releases after Justice for All, all selling in the millions nonetheless, have lent some credibility to the joke, but anyone claiming that Master of Puppets was made with the single idea of cashing in is worthy of being pelted to death with Cradle of Filth CDs. Metallica, in 1986, was not yet a rich'n'bloated guy's milking cow. No, it still was an ambitious young group that, despite for the most parts just copying their previous work, still had their own idea. None of the money they gained from Master of Puppets in the end was by any means automatically there to be cashed in. Had it been, someone else would have grabbed it. Granted, the album idea was already formatted well enough to be franchised, a fact that can be verified simply by observing that the slow melodic pieces, i.e. Fade to Black, Sanitarium and One, are all placed on the same spot on the respective albums, and that the \"progressive\" instrumentals (Call of Ktulu, Orion, To Live Is to Die) hold an equally fixed position in the track listings. There is an underlying template at work here. But it was their own format, and if they managed to pull it off well enough to reap the rich harvest, it should be OK for anyone who claims to support capitalism. If it isn't, well, then the underground \u00fcbertr00 black metal penguins with their obscure demo tapes (limited to 13 official copies and the six special top secret \"goat blood\" editions for the closest circle of friends and the artists' mothers) have already won. If getting a million dollars has something inherently bad in it, then stop trying to get a recording contract and simply shove your music to MySpace and Audiostreet, or better yet, shut yourself into the grimness of your step-dad's basement and play your music to no one. Don't be surprised if you get beaten up by the jocks sometimes, though. I know there are hundreds of bands that follow the ideology, but for every one of those, there's a hundred more striving to get signed. Commercial success does not always mean the album sucks. Most often it does, I'll admit, but not quite always. If there is an overriding, unavoidable need for chart music to exist, I'll take any song from any Metallica album (save St Anger) over any spanish/german/swedish/finnish brainless pop song and play it from here to eternity with glee. And I don't care if Ulrich can get better than average Westfalen air-dried ham onto his danish sandwiches as a result. That's the spirit of capitalism, and claiming it's wrong equals being a communist. The guys came up with a succesful formula, milked it, people bought the milk, and they got rich. Right?\n\nSo, I'd just like to point out that it took more than four years after the album's release before I heard anyone even remotely resembling a metalhead calling MoP overrated for the first time. Never, I repeat NEVER, during the 80's did anyone say that. And it took half a decade after the Black Album before Metallica-bashing became part of the metalhead trueness-olympics pentathlon (the second sport right after \"I've met the guys from Beherit in a sauna\" boasting contest, and before the much more rigorous field excercise of making the demo with the lowest number of released official copies, negative digits win). Curiously, a high crest in the wave of MoP-hating coincided with Ulrich's Napster goofiness, and the smell of a bitter revenge by the metal masses hangs heavy in the air. Repent, you fools. And don't come back until you've redeemed yourselves. It wasn't the fault of Master of Puppets itself, it was the amusing drummer guy who lost his hold on the controls of his intellectual moped after finding out that he had been robbed of his 123rd million.\n\nI know it's too much to ask to tell people not to hate Master of Puppets because they only see it as just a thrash album among other thrash albums; it was a magnificient blueprint to be photocopied by thousands of others during the next decade, and cannot be judged among its own spawn, but in the end, it's just an album, and cannot be objectively elevated above the others of its kind, except for nostalgic reasons. But it simply cannot be too much to ask people to stop hating it just because they don't like Lar$ and hate St Anger and the Loads. This album has proven itself worthy of the attention it gets, and doesn't deserve to be treated rudely because of the things that happened after it was released. It has set a standard to measure other things with. And it isn't a bad album, honestly. You may hate it, but don't turn that hate into a public circus act, unless you already hated it in the 80's, in which case you are better entitled to your opinion than I am and I humbly bow and retreat in front of the tr00ness of the Great Old One.\n\nI spent quite a while thinking about the rating. Finally I realized that my own rating guidelines in my profile give me an undisputable answer. I've written that a 90+ means the album will stay on my playlist for years. Master of Puppets has been on my \"once-monthly\" playlist for over 19 years already, and thus I guess it has proven its value many times over.\n",
        "\nSo it\u2019s January of 2004, and a 14-year-old kid steps into his local MVC outlet and casts his eye upon the bargain bin. Sitting in there is an album he\u2019s heard much about, by a group who have hung in the periphery of his na\u00efve conscience for quite some time. So of course, he\u2019s drawn to it, and, seeing it\u2019s only \u00a35 with a free DVD, he buys it right up. Yes, that\u2019s right. My first \u2018heavy\u2019 album was \u2018St. Anger\u2019 by Metallica. The shame will hang over my head forever.\n\nSince that time, I\u2019ve listened to this album TWICE \u2013 the first time was straight after I\u2019d bought it, the second being for the purpose of this review. Likely as not I\u2019ll do what I should have done long ago and sell it once this is complete. Even at that innocent and unassuming age, I could tell something was very wrong with this record within seconds.\n\nI\u2019ve never had many problems with any other Metallica album I own \u2013 after the quality of \u2018Kill \u2018Em All\u2019 through to the \u2018Black Album\u2019 (don\u2019t piss and moan, it\u2019s actually quite good), so re-visiting \u2018St. Anger\u2019 is particularly painful, largely due to the fact that you can quite clearly hear the sound of a band trying to recapture the glory of their thrash days \u2013 the problem is that they seem to have completely forgotten how to write a song even resembling their old sound, and have gone about executing it in every wrong way possible. The front cover artwork serves as a perfect metaphor for the content within \u2013 clearly trying to recreate some kind of gritty feeling but ultimately coming across as polished and false (a damn shame considering some of Pushead\u2019s prior work)\n\nNow, if I\u2019m totally honest, the album is not totally 100% shite (Barely). There are certainly a few interesting riffs floating around here and there, particularly in the likes of \u2018Invisible Kid\u2019 and \u2018My World\u2019, and the turn into angrier lyrical territory is perhaps more welcome compared to some of the sheer trash he\u2019s come out with on \u2018Load\u2019 and \u2018Reload\u2019, but these are all meagre compensations when you consider the bigger picture \u2013 something that I\u2019d really rather not do too often, so heinous are some of the flaws this record carries in abundance\n\nAlthough it\u2019s becoming a clich\u00e9 to mention it, THAT snare drum sound was, is, and will remain the most irritating thing you will ever hear, with the possible exception of whatever spews out when Fred Durst decides to open his mouth again. There is one small way in which you can garner enjoyment from that awful 'BUNG BUNG BUNG' noise \u2013 simply lay back and imagine Lars \u2018tubby tub-thumper\u2019 Ulrich is beating himself around the face with a copper pipe. Go on, try it. Not getting much satisfaction from that thought? Well that might be because the crapiness of the rest of the album is distracting you.\n\nOver the stuttering riff that opens up \u2018Frantic\u2019, James Hetfield\u2019s vocals sound just\u2026awful. While it might be a delight to some to hear his old gruff bark renewed in full, it says an awful lot about the rest of the record when his vocals don\u2019t even seem to fit in with the timing and full body of the song \u2013 and barring a few exceptions, this is how it goes for the ENTIRE album. The bass, meanwhile, isn\u2019t even worth wasting words on. Handled by \u201cproducer\u201d Bob Rock after Jason Newsted quit, the bass sound is largely inaudible throughout, as though Rock is attempting to hide his ineptitude by pushing the clanging drums and turgid rhythm guitar to the fore (if this sounds like the mix of \u2018\u2026And Justice For All\u2019, please remind yourself that Newsted wasn\u2019t crap). If only the sorry bastard would piss off back to Bon Jovi and stop fucking with Metallica!!!\n\nBut the worst and most terrible sin of all is without doubt what they\u2019ve done to Kirk Hammett. Whether or not you like Metallica or not is a moot point when it comes to Hammett \u2013 it\u2019s hard to deny that the man is a hugely talented player, and one of the best guitarists to emerge from the thrash scene in the 1980s. So with that in mind, the treatment given to him on this record is even more unforgivable. In the long and torturous time it takes for \u2018St. Anger\u2019 to finish, NOT A SINGLE SOLO IS PLAYED. EVER. And fuck only knows why Metallica have simply forced Kirk to stifle the creative flair and skill he\u2019s displayed on almost every album so far and have him simply play behind the crappy riffs thrown out by Hetfield \u2013 quite frankly it\u2019s hard to see why they didn\u2019t just double what Hetfield was playing in the first place, they certainly had the damn Pro Tools for it\u2026\n\nOverall\u2026 oh fuck it; frankly I\u2019m sick of writing about this pile of cow shit, I\u2019d have thought you would have all got the message from the rest of this review. Now I\u2019m off to find an axe, \u2018St. Anger\u2019 is about to get what\u2019s coming to it\u2026\n",
        "\nThe black album is probably my least favourite Metallica record. It's the only album, in my opinion, that Metallica just went \"Screw it, lets write a record that will sell lots\". Still, it was cheap, and I've always wondered how on earth it was produced so well, so I decided to buy it. A good choice, in the end.\n\nThe DVD goes through most of the bigger tracks, eg. Sandman, Sad but True, Nothing Else Matters, etc. There's some pretty interesting tidbits in here, like the original version of Sandman, with the alternate riff (it sounds real crappy!), the usage of 30-40 room mikes for the drums (!!!) and the demo versions of all the songs, which is interesting. There's also extra guitars in the Unforgiven, the Elevator Version of Nothing Else Matters, alternate bass parts on My Friend of Misery etc. Quite a lot really. A lot of information is given on the production, recording and mastering of the album too, which I found particularly interesting, because for me, this album is one of the best produced Metal albums out there.\n\nWHile I don't have A Year and a Half.., and can't say how much footage was recycled, I found the whole DVD fairly educational, and pretty interesting. There's probably not much here if you're not a big fan of Metallica, but if you are a fan, you'll probably find this fairly informative and entertaining. Recommended.\n",
        "\nAfter Cliff Burton\u2019s tragic death in the hinterlands of northern Europe in 1986, Metallica regrouped themselves by pinching Flotsam & Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted and forging on whatever the future would hold for them. And as is well known, the floodgates of stardom would engulf the band in short order. But at the time, Metallica were merely a remarkably successful underground metal band, and to help Newsted find his sea legs, a mini album of cover versions was unleashed. \n\n\nI\u2019ll pause a moment to explain the odd title of this here record. First of all, at this point Metallica were still a largely grass-roots proposition with heavy ties to their fan base. Thus the idea of a big record company (or retailers) seizing a brief record from the band and taking the opportunity to gouge fans by selling it for full price was unacceptable to the (then) unimpeachable ethics of the band. So putting the suggested retail price in the title seemed to be a good deterrent against this happening. Also the band had issued this sort of \u201cgarage\u201d item before; the B-side of the \u201cCreeping Death\u201d 12-inch single contained cover versions of tracks by Diamond Head and Blitzkrieg, and was titled \u201cGarage Days Revisited.\u201d Thus, being the band\u2019s second such release, it was thusly dubbed \u201cre-revisited.\u201d Everyone cool with this? Okay\u2026on we go. \n\n\nAs for the contents, they\u2019re uniformly strong and a nice peek into some of the more obscure bands that informed the Metallica style. Newsted gives a very strong first accounting of himself, taking full advantage of the record\u2019s rough and live sound job. Diamond Head\u2019s \u201cHelpless\u201d actually is the opener and least impressive number, as it pretty much paces by uneventfully. James Hetfield\u2019s crunchy rhythm guitars are just fine, but overall the band did a much better job earlier on that band\u2019s immortal track \u201cAm I Evil.\u201d Holocaust\u2019s \u201cThe Small Hours\u201d is next, and this is massive. Slowed to a doomier pace than the original, Metallica really lock into some evil grooves here, and Hetfield\u2019s vocals are particularly vicious. Similarly the odd choice of Killing Joke\u2019s \u201cThe Wait\u201d works out just brilliantly. The off-kilter pace of the original is replaced by a titanic Metallica chug, and the sinister lyrics suit our heroes just fine. Budgie are next up for abuse, and their seminal \u201cCrash Course In Brain Surgery\u201d is abused rather well. There\u2019s no vivid transformation here, just a great early metal tune brought up to modern snuff by some of the genre\u2019s best technicians. And then there\u2019s the Misfits\u2019 medley. New Jersey\u2019s finest horror punks are honored with a savage rendering of both \u201cLast Caress\u201d and \u201cGreen Hell,\u201d the first marked by it\u2019s Ramones-like catchy chords, and the latter by it\u2019s thrashing madness. The band (perhaps drunkenly) attempt to run through Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cRun To The Hills\u201d as the whole messy affair fades out.\n\n\nA fun, fun record that\u2019s long out of print in this form, it was also perhaps the last time (by my memory at least) that we\u2019d ever witness Metallica let things hang this casually, or show such careful regards for their fans\u2019 bank accounts. From here on in, a more professional, calculated, and ultimately more corporate Metallica would manifest itself. Wow. I still remember beating up a fellow high school student who\u2019d stolen two of my Ride The Lightning era bootleg concert tapes, which were at time, band endorsed and perhaps even provided. Things do indeed, change.\n",
        "\nI would call this the only essential Metallica DVD. Not only do you not have to fear that some moron went back in and edited in some material from the \u201cblack album\u201d era, or, heaven forfend, later material than that, but everything on here is pre- \u201cand justice for all\u201d!\nSo it is only PRIME Metallica, only the good stuff, you can rest assured.\nThere is quite an obvious reason for this. The purpose of this DVD is twofold: To collect together videotaped footage of the band during the Cliff Burton era, and, also a tribute to Cliff. His bass solos are highlighted and you see live that he played his bass like an awesome guitar player might (except he didn\u2019t use a pick). Very intense and soulful. You can also see how his bass solo was the centerpiece for the early Metallica live show. Inevitably, these segments will produce a poignant feeling mixed in with awe. Photo montages of him support this feeling.\nThe footage in general is totally mesmerizing. You gotta remember this was back when Metallica was the biggest, baddest, hottest metal band in the land, and it is a pure joy to see James wearing spandex, a bullet belt and whipping his hair around while thrashing away, looking so young. This in contrast with Cliff\u2019s bellbottoms made an interesting dynamic. Thank goodness these tapes exist.\nThe video footage is extremely raw, as 80\u2019s video is likely to be. Even on DVD, no glitches at all were corrected. This is not a complaint. It just adds to the unpolished, untainted, unretouched, \u201cfans only\u201d vibe. It is similar in quality to the \u201clive in Gothenburg\u201d bonus DVD on the reissue of King Diamond\u2019s \u201cAbigail\u201d or the live bonus DVD on Fates Warning\u2019s \u201cawaken the guardian\u201d, in other words, 80\u2019s raw home video greatness! Never has nostalgia and pure metal mixed like this! Since this is a standalone DVD, not likely to be reissued in a deluxe edition of Kill em all anytime soon (it would fit perfectly), it has more than enough merit to be sold on its own.\nWhen you watch this, you go \u201cOh yeah, Metallica was a METAL band once upon a time!\u201d And such an awesome one too. For that alone it is worth it, but for a glimpse of a once-great band in their heyday, as well as a touching as well as rockin\u2019 tribute to their fallen brother, this great DVD is a must-have.\n",
        "\nThis is the most well-known Metallica demo, showing the band\u2019s NWOBHM roots very clearly. James Hetfield sounds almost nothing like his rough yell that would show up on the first few Metallica albums. Here, he attempts a more melodic style of singing, and judging by the material on this and other early Metallica recordings, it\u2019s not hard to see why he switched. He\u2019s really not that good. For the most part his voice is tolerable, but it doesn\u2019t really fit in with the songs themselves, and often sounds somewhat forced. The guitar riffs are better, though they would be sped up on Kill \u2018Em All. Then Lars\u2019 drumming isn\u2019t anything special, though it at least fits the songs. Overall, this demo is okay; it\u2019s just that everything on this demo was improved greatly when the band later recorded Kill \u2018Em All. This is like Kill \u2018Em All, but not as fast, not as aggressive, and more oriented towards NWOBHM. Also the songs Whiplash and No Remorse don\u2019t show up here, along with Cliff Burton\u2019s bass solo (although considering Cliff Burton doesn\u2019t play bass on this, that isn\u2019t really something to be shocked about).\n\nHit The Lights is the opener. This starts off with Lars banging the drums for a second, then the guitar and drum wave comes in. When this song was rerecorded for Kill \u2018Em All, it would instead start with a fade-in with the guitar and drum wave. This song is pretty representative overall of the demo, showcasing the highlights and lowlights of the performance. James is high-pitched, the guitars play midpaced to fast, and the drums keep the shaky beat.\n\nThe Mechanix is alright. It has a galloping main riff, and is overall a faster song. The lyrics are cheesy as hell, even as far as early Metallica is concerned. This song would be much improved once it was rewritten as The Four Horsemen. In this form, it\u2019s much more simple, and less unique.\n\nMotorbreath is very similar to The Mechanix. At least it doesn\u2019t have painfully bad sexual double entendres in the lyrics. The main riff here is also a galloping riff, and it\u2019s a faster song again.\n\nNext up is Seek & Destroy. I\u2019ve always found this song to be pretty overrated and overlong, along with being way too midpaced. At least on this demo, it\u2019s cut off by a couple minutes. It instead ends shortly after the guitar solo instead of continuing on into another 3 fucking choruses in a row or so. I prefer this to the album version, only because it doesn\u2019t quite drag on for so long.\n\nMetal Militia is a good song, but again, it would be much faster on Kill \u2018Em All. It\u2019s still pretty solid here though, and James\u2019 clean vocals work well here in this context. This is a definite highlight of this demo.\n\nJump In The Fire has different lyrics here from Kill \u2018Em All. As opposed to the almost Satanic lyrics that would be in the album version, the lyrics here are, like The Mechanix\u2019s, more sex-oriented. I haven\u2019t been able to find the lyrics anywhere and it\u2019s hard to tell what James is saying at times though, though it sounds like it involves his pants somehow. Anyways, the music itself is a bit sloppy, and it ends right after the solo, so it doesn\u2019t repeat the chorus for a whole long time.\n\nPhantom Lord is the last track here, and just like some other songs here, it\u2019s shorter than the Kill \u2018Em All version. There really isn\u2019t much else to say about this track. It\u2019s a fast song like most of the other songs on here (barring Seek & Destroy, which shows that Metallica sucks at midpaced songs for the most part), and it\u2019s sloppier than the album version. Yeah.\n\nSo to sum things up, this definitely has a lot of historical importance, since it\u2019s one of the earliest Thrash recordings around, after stuff like Overkill and Metal Church\u2019s early works. It\u2019s also enjoyable on a musical level and is in some ways better than Kill \u2018Em All (some songs don\u2019t drag on as often as they do in KEA), but overall Metallica would do better with their debut album. James\u2019 vocals would also improve, if only for a short while. If you do come across this somehow, I say get it! You can probably find a bootleg of this on eBay rather easily, or if you\u2019re exceedingly lucky, possibly find an original copy of the demo on cassette. Either way, this will be a great addition to your Metal collection.\n",
        "\nObviously, Metallica wanted to piss off as much as their fan base as they could in the late 90's. Load, then Reload, then Garage Inc- lots of strange stuff that alienated tonnes of people. This was the final insult to the legions of fans- a tonne of old tunes and new, mixed in with a massive symphony orchestra. Luckily, while a lesser band would wilt under the pressure, Metallica rise to the occaison. Not only is the orchestra great, but they're complemented by a particularly thunderous Metallica.\n\nThe album starts off with The Ecstasy of Gold. While it's always good to hear this song, the symphony kicks it up to a new level. it's a really epic, massive version of the usual set opener, and It's never sounded this good before or since. This high level of goodness keeps up throughout Ktulu, which fits very well with the orchestra. THe huge epic song goes into another long track, that being the mighty Puppets. While Metallica give it all throughout this song, a lot of the parts are too chromatic to really fit in well with the orchestra.\n\nOne thing I was expecting was that the more chromatic/pentatonic stuff would sound the worse, while the more Minor keys would fit the orchestra better. While that's true in a few cases, there are a few exceptions. Devil's Dance gets even groovier, while other load era songs Like Hero of the Day and Bleeding Me sound even better. Outlaw Torn really, really needs a mention here. With the exception of Battery maybe, it's the best track here. James's singing is amazing in the song, (Outlaw Torn, I mean.) and the orchestra takes the middle section and the soaring chorus riffs to excellent new heights. James's singing is really, really good in this album. He can't do the heavy stuff that well (Though he pulls off some really, really good growls in Memory Remains), but when he sings the stuff off Load, Reload, etc, well, it's never sounded so good. The deep rich voice we all love, with a rawness you don't get in the studio versions. \n\nSome of the old tunes work really well too. I've already discussed puppets and Ktulu, but Battery really needs to be mentioned here. The opening acoustic bit is completely redone by the Orchestra, and dammit it's gorgeous. For Whom the Bell Tolls is given a great rendition by the boys, and the orchestra fits in super well, playing alternating lead lines and bringing the song to a huge climax. Thingy is a down really well too, turning the worst song on Puppets into a spooky, atmospheric tune. One thing that I'mr eally really puzzled about though is why didn't Fade to Black get included? It would fit perfectly into this! \n\nSo, a lot of the songs work really good, but there's definetly a few shockers. One losses all of it's bite and impact, Sad but True is really not suited, and well, Whereever I may Roam is just terrible! What the hell where they thinking? A really really terrible ending with the horrible wah wanking that shows why Kirk's soloing style can get so annoying. The rest of the song isn't much better.\n\nBut aside from a few hiccups, there's a lot of great stuff here, whether it's the strings on Nothing Else MAtters to the slow build up of Hero of the Day. the two new songs are just as good, - Human being a slow, doomy riffer, and No Leaf Clover a power ballad that can stand with Tallica's best. The production is good, nice and clear, and without too many studio overdubs. This album really makes the songs sound so much more massive and complete, and it's a must buy for any Metallica fan. I wish they would've put Fade to Black and Fight fire with Fire in it though. (Come on, Fight Fire could've worked. Maybe.) With a better set list this could be a classic album, but as it stands it's still pretty good.\n",
        "\nI must admit to being biased towards this disc. THis is the album that turned me onto real metal, the album that opened up my world. I was at a friends place and he put The Prince on, and I was stunned by the fast riffing and the great singing/growling thing James was doing. I went out and got all the metal I could find.\n\n7 Years later, and most of the early stuff I bought is at the bottom of my CD collection. This album still gets regular spins though, basically because there's two awesome but very different CD's on offer here. The first CD, full of the new covers, is full of experimentation and just a bit of goofing around. The seconds CD, the one I guess you're all looking for, is just full of straight up, ass whooping thrash.\n\nI'll start with the first CD. Let me jsut say right now that most of you will hate this CD. THe only bands that make sense to me would be Sabbath, Diamond Head and Merciful Fate. Still, there's a lot of quality cuts on here. The album starts off a bit weakly, with the punky blast of Free Speech, but the next two songs are really, really good. It's Electric and Sabbra Cadabra are bursting at the seams with energy, and James seems to really enjoy singing these songs. His performance in Sabbra Cadabra is pretty happy and stuff, it's a nice change. There's a bit of misstep with Turn the Page next.. I think it's a decent cover, but not Metallica cover. Then there's the epic, brooding Loverman. Personally, I would've prefered someone else to do the spoken word parts (Nick Cave should've guested!) But it's still a cool song, unlike anything Metallica have ever attempted.\n\nI'm not going to go through all the songs in that much detail, but there's two more tunes that really stand out. Astronomy is a really, really good power ballad, and why it wasn't the first single confuses me. Great verse and a cool, heavy chorus, with a very melodic and catchy solo to finish the song off. Met's best ballad since One? Maybe. The Merciful Fate tune stands out as the most metal thing MEtallica have done since AJFA, and there's some really, really great leads and riffs here. Top stuff.\n\nThe second disc is the one you are all looking for, and I don't blame you, because all the songs here are really, really good. The songs aren't as diverse, but you know what you're getting here, that is, super heavy and raw thrash. Helpless has a great bridge and some fairly techincal riffing, Small Hours is slow, punishing doom metal,. But my favourite is THe Prince, the heavy, almost punky kinda song. THe song that got me into Metal, it will always have a place in my heart. Am I Evil too... Damn, what a solo. This record really shows how damn good Metallica were/are (cross out whichever one seems most valid to you). They also deserve a mention for the production, because while it is raw and heavy, it's also really clear. Some of the songs are short on bass, but overall, this is heavy, raw and clear production, the best kind there is IMO. Why can't more bands do covers this good?\n\nDamn, this is one amazing covers disc. One CD full of cool, diverse tunes, the other one full of ballsy thrash. It losses 7% because of a few dodgy parts in the first CD. Overall, you won't find many better cover albums then this. Essential listening for the Met fan.\n",
        "\nIt's fair to say that without this band, half of the metal we listen to today wouldn't exist. This is probably the most historicaly significant demo in Metal's history, and when a collector friend of mine was selling his copy, I snapped it up for a fairly princely sum. Kick ass.\n\nThe production on this album isn't the best out there, but then again, what would you expect? Self produced by a band with no money.. big surprise. But you're not hearing this for the crappy production. This is awesome early thrash, full of youthful energy, speed and power. The drumming's fairly crappy and James's vocals aren't exactly the best, but the songs are super high quality, from the pile driving Phantom Lord to the first thrash song ever made, Hit The Lights. Metal Militia is really awesome though, better then the KEA version IMO. There are a few disappointments though. The Mechanix and Jump in the Fire both have absolutely rubbish lyrics, and The Mechanix sounds juvenile, and well, just plain crappy compared to what it would become. It's a lot faster though, which is good, of course.\n\nBasically, if you're just a casual metallica fan, I wouldn't really bother tracking this down, because it's pretty damn expensive, and the original copies are for the most part worn out pretty badly. That, and the fact that they're extremely hard to find. Still, for anyone with a big interest in Metallica and metal as a whole, it's definetly worth trying to find this. Put another Mortgage on your house and prepare to go bankrupt for Metaaaalllll!!!!!!!\n",
        "\nWhen Load came out, I wasn't a metal fan. I was 10 and my favourite music was Elton John. But I can imagine the slightly confused/angry reaction at the complete change in direction Metallica did. Which begs the question.. Why on Earth did Metallica release this album? A bunch of songs that didn't make it onto Load? What the hell where they thinking?\n\nThis album generally continues a lot of the ideas that where on Load. There's the bluesy riffing, and the slight country angle that was present in Load is now a bit more up front. But there's a lot of strange stuff that no other band has ever attempted. It all makes for a rather mixed up album, but it's more cohesive then Load.\n\nStill, don't start thinking that Metallica went completely un-metal. Fuel is a fast, heavy and powerful song, from the catchy opening riffs to the heavy chunking just before the solo. The solo itself is very impressive, very melodic and a bit more like old Hammett. The song Prince Charming should also be mentioned here, because it's just such a menacing song, and very heavy at that. Great song to head bang too, just a great song all round. Full of big riffs and a huge chorus. I think Slither deserves a special mention, because it's verse and pre-chorus are all really, really heavy.\n\nAfter those three, we're left with a big group of oddities. Bad Seed and Attitude sound like a heavy AC/DC, Memory Remains has some ghoulish vocals served up by Marrianne Faithfull, a big, extended Na-na-na-na ending, and some of the catchiest soloing you will ever hear. Devil's Dance is super groovy, while Low Man's Lyric is almost a straight up country ballad, but full of depth and sadness. Like a lot of these songs, it's unlike Metallica have ever attempted.\n\nOf course, these songs are crappy generic ones compared to Where the Wild things are and Fixxxer. WTWTA is a twisted, multi-layered epic. Full of strange clean parts, strange chromatic bits, military style drums and a fairly unusual, though effective solo. Fixxxer is an 8 minute long epic, with backwards guitars floating around, lots of overdubs, and a very strange, almost spoken word interlude thing. It's another very moody and unusual song from Metallica. It's also the best song on the album.\n\nA lot of these songs vary a bit in quality, but there's a few things on this album that remain constantly top-notch, that is, the vocals, the lyrics, and the production. James can be very abstract on this album, and well, I guess the lyrics do dip a bit in some places, but there is quality in every song, from the whole faded-star stuff on Memory Remains, too the Strange imagery on WTWTA, and definetly on Fixxxer, where he talks about his father's death. The vocals aren't as good as Load, but they are all really, really good. A fair bit of growling, but a lot of full-on singing. His voice isn't as rich as it is on Load, which brings me to the next point: The production. The production is the rawest since AJFA. Well, it's still fairly polished, but unlike Load and Self Titled, it doesn't sound like there where 200 guitar tracks and 100 vocals tracks or whatever. It gives the album a bit of a rough edge, always a good thing.\n\nThis album definetly isn't for everybody. For every killer track there's an Unforgiven II or a Better then You. Still, there's a lot of unique, interesting ideas in this album, and if you're an open minded Metallica fan (That may be an oxymoron though. Boom Boom!) you should check this album out.\n",
        "\nMetal fans are often stereotyped as primitive idiots. While that's definetly true with some of them, a lot of fans are also intelligent, open minded people. Obviously not Metallica fans though. Here's an argument I had with someone, a few days ago.\n\nThem: Metallica sold out!\nMe: Why did they sell out?\nThem: Because they went commercial with Load!\nMe: How did they go commercial? They completely changed their sound, their image, everything! Wouldn't they have just released a black album sound alike? Why sell out when your previous stuff sells so well?\nThem: What do you know? They cut their hair. They sold out.\n\nYeah, it's that pathetic. Calling this album a sell out is like calling Meshuggah's \"Nothing\" a sell out, cos they like, went slow dude. This is probably Metallica's most experimental album, full of strange ideas and big risks. The House that Jack Built is almost a doom metal song. It doesnt have a very conventional song structure, just lots of heavy, sludgy kind of riffs, with a long slow build up throughout the whole song, climaxing in a strange talk box (??!!??) solo. Hero of the day is in a major key (!!) for the most part, sounding bright and cheerful before going into a super heavy bridge, and then going into another cheery bit before going back into the brutalness.\n\nI could go on like that with basically every song. Kirk treats his guitar in a very different way in this album. With the exception of maybe Bleeding Me, every solo is a composition in itself. It's probably the first Metallica album that Kirk showed what he was really capable off. Sure he was a good shredder, but hell, everyone can shred. But how many people could write the solo in Outlaw Torn? How many people could do the strange, textural solo that's in Ain't my Bitch? Sure, he does have a few low points in this album (Cure and 2x4 come to mind) but for the most part, he's doing something unique and interesting, for the first time in his whole career.\n\nAll these unusual solos are backed by a lot of strange stuff from James. Outlaw Torn's middle section could almost be in an Isis song. Mama Said is straight up country. While I don't like that song much, (Probably one of the worse Metallica have ever done.) it would take a huge amount of balls to put that in a Metallica album. There's some other risky stuff in here too, like the oh-so-bluesy stuff in Poor Twisted Me, the strange, off kilter riffing that's in Ronnie, hell, even the organ/piano whatever that hangs around in the background of the song's centrepiece, Bleeding Me.\n\nAll of this is backed up by some great drumming by Lars. It's not very complicated, but it's far better then the crappy drumming in the Black Album. There's a sense of groove in the drums that where never there before, and while they aren't particurly technical, they are never, ever out of place. There's not one spot that has the wrong drum beat. No blast beats or double bass fills, just solid steady drumming.\n\nWell, despite the odd stuff coming from James and Kirk, there is some commercial things here, I will admit. The production is very commercial, but unlike the Black album, it treads the line between commercial and overproduced very nicely. The guitars are heavily distorted and thick, the drums and bass are loud, fat and powerful, and the vocals are done very, very well. The vocals are definetly the best in any Met record. Not much growling here folks, just a lot of straight up singing. Great stuff. Bob has never been particurly popular with Met fans, but few could deny the great job he's done here. It's all so thick, powerful and clear.. THe way a metal record should be. \n\nSo while I'll admit there are a few commercial considerations, for the most part, this was a big risk on Metallica's side. Strange, epic tunes (Outlaw Torn) crash with short punk songs (Wasting my Hate). Arena rock tunes like hero of the day against straight up blues tunes. Doom metal-y stuff and country.. all in the same album. You won't find this much variety in the strangest of indie bands, and here's the biggest heavy metal band in the world doing it! Worth picking up if you're a big Met fan. Not worth getting if you only like Metallica \"When they had long hair.\"\n",
        "\nHere it is, one of the most famous, revered and hated albums \u2013 The Black Album (Or simply \"Metallica\"). A most sudden twist from the lengthy Prog Thrash of \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d, this one see\u2019s Metallica play short, radio-friendly songs. Initially, I dismissed it as nothing more than a radio-friendly effort but gradually I began to enjoy it. Not enjoy it in that total \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d sense, enjoy it in the sense of \u201cyeah, this isn\u2019t half bad after all\u201d. There are some good songs on here which though not as entertaining as the early days, still put up a nice headbanging session for the average metalhead. The production is crystal clear and really well done, I can hear all the instruments very well but the vocals seem a bit too loud. \n\nMusically, this is Heavy Metal with a whole lot of groove and the occasional thrash riff with a lot of the \u2018party\u2019 feel to it. James voice is totally in that groovy party style that Modern Rock singers possess but he still puts up a good vocal performance on \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d, \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d and \u201cThrough the Never\u201d. Kirk still delivers some great, though extremely similar solos yet this is where he relies heavily on the wah pedal and even though his solos are not the extreme wah-wah of Load or Reload, they still can be irritating. Jason Newsted is a better bassist than Cliff Burton and has always been awesome whether in Voivod or Flotsam and Jetsam but Metallica largely underplays him. Fortunately, Newsted\u2019s bass can be well heard in this album unlike \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d. Lars has always been his sucky self but he actually delivers a good drum intro to \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d!\n\n\u201cEnter Sandman\u201d has that infamous start and infamous riff and is all in all an enjoyable song, horribly over hyped by MTV and yet pretty enjoyable. \u201cSad but true\u201d is what some call \u201cheavy\u201d but what I call \u201cunintelligent and overlong\u201d. There\u2019s a good reason why, a totally unintelligent and boring riff repeated constantly throughout the song with irritating vocal lines (that irritating \u201chey\u201d chant). \u201cHolier than Thou\u201d has a good groovy riff with everything else being standard fare. \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d is the first really stunning song on the album \u2013 A nice acoustic start and for the first time on this album \u2013 Jame\u2019s voice sounds good! The song is very catchy, strangely emotional and that chorus and solo are particularly memorable. Its slow but its excellent, the sequel sucked but this one wont get out of your head for a while when you first hear it. \u201cWherever I Roam\u201d sends the album back to its groove sound and starts off promisingly with excellent guitar harmonies, Jame\u2019s voice fits with the music and he does do a good job making the verses and chorus catchy, nothing special about solo and the song somehow lasts out its full length! \u201cDon\u2019t Tread On Me\u201d has a strange rhythm to it and a memorable chorus but the song tends to get old fast due to the repetition the band seems to insist on. \n\n\u201cThrough The Never\u201d is where the album shines again. If the entire album was like this, it\u2019d be awesome. The song is fast, heavy and the vocals are well done. \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d despite having some nice lyrics has an uninteresting structure and average vocals, extremely boring if you ask me. \u201cOf Wolf and Man\u201d is another excellently done number that has some groovy, somewhat thrash riffs in it. \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d has an intro similar to Dawn Patrol and has a pretty heavy riff and a good solo by Kirk but even it tends to get repetitive. \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d at least for once doesn\u2019t have an overused riff or a bad structure and is actually a really fun song. Good solos and nice bluesy riffing and it sustain its length very well for once. \u201cThe Struggle Within\u201d starts with a good drum intro (A first time for Lars?) and has nice heavy intro riff with annoying vocals by James\u2019s that seems to be all over the place in the song thanks to effects but it actually manages to make through it\u2019s length impressively. \n\nGood Songs: The Unforgiven, Through The Never, Enter Sandman, My Friend Of Misery, Wherever I May Roam, Of Wolf and Man.\nDecent Songs: Holier Than Thou, Don\u2019t Tread On Me, The God That Failed, The Struggle Within.\nFiller: Sad but true, Nothing Else Matters\n\nSo there it ends. The Black Album \u2013 revered by many, hated by many as well and a black mark on Metallica\u2019s metal discography. Six good songs, four decent and Two fillers is actually good for an album that latched onto the mainstream. Everything after this album totally sucks but I\u2019d reckon you\u2019d like this album if you\u2019re a metalhead who doesn\u2019t mind Metal with groove and a whole party feel to it or a rock fan looking to become a metal fan \u2013 this is the perfect album for you. It\u2019s a decent album, but nothing that makes me want to listen to it constantly.\n",
        "\nI dont know what the hell urged me to download this album along with Reload and The Black Album. I knew they were as bad as piss and even though The Black Album (a.k.a. - Metallica) was mediocre, these releases really pissed me off right from track number one. Metallica were awesome at Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning and then turned merely good with the follow-ups and descended into mediocrity with their self-titled album which I think is the first groove metal album but this album is nothing but plain sewage. \n\nEverything with this record has a problem right from the song titles (Ain't My Bitch, 2x4, The House That Jack Built, what the hell?), the album cover (nothing as good as Ride The Lightning, Band is playing safe by not having any aggressive covers), the lyrics (Metallica were never master lyricists but Ain\u2019t My Bitch and Mama Said have some of the worst lyrics ever - hardly making sense) and last of all the supreme problem - music. There are bands with stupid lyrics and playful song titles but who play well instead, sadly this isn't the case with Load as the music here is the most irritating modern rock record. Yes, Metallica play Modern Rock here and if you dont know what Modern Rock is - It's music that\u2019s very vaguely metal with country-style vocals and distorted solos (sometimes) and 'riff' (I dont care about grammar, using the word in plural would be musically wrong). Metallica play a heavier Modern Rock with even more annoying vocals than the original genre had.\n\nFlaws, dont ask. Everything about this disc has flaw written all over it. The public has somehow acquired a liking for this damned CD. Now when this CD was made Lars main purpose was to make a CD full of radio-friendly Modern rock but then you'd ask why they made long songs and a 9 minute piece called the Outlaw Thorn? I'll tell you why, the same band (its hard to believe) released a mediocre-good record called Master of Puppets in which they had a song called Orion which was 8 minute's long. Orion was an otherwise overstretched mediocre instrumental but since Master of Puppets made it to the good books of the mainstream and Metallica found that people thought Orion was \"out of this world\" and \"progressive\" they decided to put a 9 minute piece on their new album so as to generate sales from the metal public who thought that since there was a 9 minute song here, things could be different and the public would also call these songs \"progressive\". In short, the strategy worked brilliantly and Metallica had lots of cash and broke thousands of metal-hearts. It maybe \"79 minutes\" but these 79 minutes are filled with rubbish and are nothing more than space-wasters just as they did with St.Anger.\n\nOn a song level, it depends on your interest. If you like Modern rock with perhaps a bit more metal in it then you'd be over-the-moon on hearing this but if you\u2019re a metal fan - STAY AWAY. Nothing here could remotely interest the metal-ness in you though the \"nu-metal open minds\" would damn you and tell you to buy it and listen to it with an \"open-mind\". James\u2019s voice is terrible here as it always has been since the Black Album, Kirk's solos are just \"wah-wah\", Lars's drumming - as bad as always and I still cant see Jason anywhere here, Why such a talented bassist as Jason would join this band is beyond my knowledge but at least he left before the worst came (a.k.a. - St.Anger). The 1 point here goes to average King Nothing which is fun for some time and boringly repetitive otherwiseand surely the best song on Load. If you really feel the urge to hear the album, download it and dont buy it. Metal fans shouldn't put in anything into Lars\u2019s already jam-packed money safe, Metallica's years of metal are over - they would release another modern rock album (slightly better than this but equally bad in the end) after this and then release a mallcore album (St.Anger) which has nothing to do with metal and just shame the band's early years - R.I.P. - Metallica.\n",
        "\n\u201cFuck \u2018em, this is not Metallica! This is not even metal!\u201d That\u2019s what you hear regularly when discussing Metallica\u2019s \u2018S & M\u2019. Well, just ignore all those \u2018true metallers\u2019 who still join forces and then declare to detest the post-\u2018Black Album\u2019-Metallica, or even the post-\u2018Master Of Puppets\u2019-Metallica since \u2018it\u2019s not metal anymore\u2019. No, this is no ordinary metal anymore, indeed. This wonderful album takes metal in general, and specifically Metallica to an entire new level. The \u2018four horsemen\u2019 and arranger/S.F. Symphony director Michael Kamen (R.I.P.) have chosen a number of songs covering every (musical) era Metallica went through until 1999, from \u2018Ride The Lightning\u2019 to \u2018ReLoad\u2019. So why didn\u2019t they play early standards like \u201cSeek And Destroy\u201d, or other classics like \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d or \u201cFade To Black\u201d? Probably because of the fact that arranging these songs for orchestra simply wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nAllright, the music. Let me start by saying that not all the arrangements on this album are as marvellous as the title of this review might imply. For example, \u201cBleeding Me\u201d just lacks tension and \u201cThe Memory Remains\u201d really sounds better when solely played by Metallica. But - and there\u2019s a huge \u2018but\u2019 here \u2013 the rest of the album varies from \u2018good\u2019 to \u2018unbelievably great\u2019. And this high level is there right from the start. \u201cThe Ecstacy Of Gold\u201d, for years the \u2018official\u2019 Metallica intro, just sounds so astonishingly beautiful when performed live by a real orchestra. This magical feeling you get when listening to this track gets even stronger when right afterwards \u201cThe Call Of The Ktulu\u201d is played. Just breathtaking. Nothing less. The power, the enormous tension and the wonderful orchestral arrangement make this version of \u201cThe Call...\u201d a true highlight in Metallica\u2019s entire career. Other outstanding tracks on the first disc are \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, \u201cFuel\u201d and the new song \u201cNo Leaf Clover\u201d.\nThe second disc takes off with the classic Metallica ballad \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d. It\u2019s not really necessary to say anything about this track, since it\u2019s been played over and over again by numerous radio and TV stations all over the world. \u201cFor Whom The Bell Tolls\u201d, already a powerful \u2018vintage\u2019 Metallica anthem on itself, becomes even more powerful when the four bandmembers are accompanied by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Also the slow but heavy \u201c- Human\u201d (just like \u201cNo Leaf Clover\u201d a new song) is interesting to listen to. But the apotheosis of Metallica\u2019s symphonic adventure comes with the final three tracks. \u201cOne\u201d gets and extraordinary dramatic effect from both the passionate (yes, that does sound cheesy, but it\u2019s true), emotional voice of James Hetfield and the arrangement Michael Kamen wrote for it, \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d rises above all standards in this orchestral version and the massive and furious \u201cBattery\u201d \u2013 with a ripping solo by Kirk Hammett \u2013 makes you float out of your body once again and wish you were there when Metallica performed these shows that were recorded for 'S & M'.\n\nOne thing about \u2018S & M\u2019 is for sure: both \u2018lovers\u2019 and \u2018haters\u2019 will have to admit that it\u2019s a unique project in music and a milestone in Metallica\u2019s career. Allthough bands like Rage and Scorpions also released so-called symphonic albums, I still concider \u2018S & M\u2019 to be by far the best in this range.\nMany people (no, I don\u2019t charge anyone) are unfortunately under the influence of the masses nowadays and, after a while, start saying things the masses \u2018whisper in their ear\u2019, so to say. Personally, I really don\u2019t give a shit about other people\u2019s opinion about anything, whether it\u2019s music, clothing or politics, and also in this case, I don\u2019t care if people will point at me as being \u2018stupid\u2019, \u2018not metal\u2019 or \u2018very smart\u2019. I just think Metallica couldn\u2019t have found a better way to enter the new millennium.\n",
        "\nI've never really liked NEM, but the orchestra version is much better then the black album ever was. This song, which always sounds quite sterile to me whenever i hear the old version, really comes alive in this setting. The string arrangement sounds exactly like it did in the old version, jsut beefed up a lot, mixed a lot louder which really suits the song. The solo is pretty much the same, and James's vocals are pretty damn good, pretty heartfelt. Lars doesnt come in for a while too, which really emphasises the dynamics of the song, making it a lot better.\n\nThe next song is For Whom The Bell Tolls, and its also pretty good. The double bass Lars adds makes the song sound a bit better, and while the string arrangement for this one clashes with the guitars from time to time, most of the time it complements it adequately. While there's nothing amazing about this song, what we do have is an interesting reworking or a classic. Not as good as the original, but still rather excellent.\n\nThe final song is -Human, which is a very cool track indeed. There's a short, brassy intro, and then the riffs kick in. The opening riff goes straight for the throat. It's slow and downtuned, with some big rock drumming thrown in for good measure. While the song does drag a bit in the verses and the bridge, the awesome heavy chorus makes up for it. It's a refreshing change from the usual Metallica stuff you're used to hearing.\n\nThe video isnt really that great quality, but hey, this was released in 1999, so they couldnt put a great quality movie on a CD ROM and expect it to play with the computers we had back then. It's a pretty cool concert video, very nicely put together. One thing that surprised me was the fact that James sat in with the rest of the orchestra, which seemed odd to me, as you usually see him out at stage centre. Still, it's a nice change to see Kirk have the spotlight for a bit. All in all, the video's nice, but you can download better. \n\nSo, to sum up, this is quite a good single. A few extra tracks that aren't crappy b-sides, and a video thrown in. Pretty good, when you think about it.\n",
        "\nMetallica refined their hard, fast attack on this one, and took their musical direction in more places. Some experiments such as slower tempos, more changes in musical variation and eerie new melodies are examples of this new refinement. 2 songs from the Mustaine era are included on here, and not suprisingly, are the 2 best songs on the album. Bassist Cliff Burton takes the spotlight a bit more on this one, as he was hardly showcased as an incredible bassist on Kill em All (with the exception of the soulful bass solo of Anesthesia).\n\nFight Fire With Fire opens the album with a bang and is one of the fastest, most aggressive songs Metallica has ever done. This easily outdoes anything on Kill em All in terms of speed and heaviness. Ride The Lightning follows it up, and it is obviously the best song on the album. The solos are ripping, the riffs demand immediate headbanging, and there are about 4-5 tempo shifts in the whole songs. Creeping Death is noteworthy for its \"DIE!\" middle section while Fade to Black is an immediate standout, boasting some heartfelt chord patterns and vocal lines, but it doesnt go in as many places as in Ride the Lightning or The Call of Ktulu. The Call of Ktulu is the other standout on the album, boasting some attention to musical detail that would make Bach blush. The solos are wild and it keeps your attention beginning to end. Its one of those songs that are similar to a roller coaster in content.\n\nThis is Metallica's second great effort. Sadly, they would never reach the peak they set with the first 4 albums again, but the fact that they are shit nowadays makes this music all the more lovable. Cliff Burton and Dave Mustaine DEFINETELY had some hold over Metallica's progression over the years, whether many agree or disagree. \n\nEssential midpaced thrash.\n",
        "\nSo I've been listening to alot of old Metallica lately. Cause no matter what the band now has been reduced to, they were really true fucking metal. Tight jeans, sneakers, bulletbelts, screaming guitars, and countless cases of beer. And this classic video, a tribute to the deceased Cliff Burton (a death which also more or less meant the death of Metallica's songwriting abilities, although there are moments on both AJFA and The Black Album that are tolerable). Now first off, I wanna point out that I just watched a downloaded version of it, and I will buy the DVD later on, so if the quality of the DVD is better, I'll update this review.\n\nCause the quality, mostly in picture, was alot of the times kinda crappy. But no one cares. This is Metal, not Opeth. The video opens with an absolutely priceless recording of Kirk, Lars and James being filmed (I assume by Cliff) while walking into a store, grabbing one sixpack of beer each and some candy, and then walking straight out of the store without paying. Classic shit. Still, the quality of this recording in particular was quite shitty.\n\n\nBasically, this recording contains random footage and quick interviews with the band, and mostly old live songs. Ripping renditions of \"Creeping Death\", \"Metal Militia\", \"Master of Puppets\" and of course the Diamond Head classic \"Am I Evil\" decorate this masterful video, plus several bass solos from the one and only Cliff Burton, may he rest in weed. He was truly a genius with the bass, and while \"Anesthesia\" is a pretty dumb song in the studio, watching him do it live is truly out of this world.\n\nThe live recordings give a good representation of Metallica's career up to the point of Cliff's death - the golden years of true thrash for these guys. Probably the most interesting is the versions of \"Whiplash\", \"No Remorse\" and \"Metal Militia\" from '83, when they opened for NWOBHM titans Raven on the \"Kill Em All For One\" tour. (The last Raven album was called \"All For One\", go figure). James, not quite the skilled guitarplayer he'd soon become, has to constantly look at the guitar to keep track of where he's going. But he's totally into it, as is the entire band, on this show and all the others.\n\nAgain, the quality of the recording is pretty bad. There's only one angle per gig, and the cameramen aren't the most skilled. Quite blurry picture too. But what it all comes down to is the honesty, the power, and the beer. Before the days when big money got a hold of them, forcing them to write lyrics about immature teenage angst. It's sad what happens, but in the early days, they really were total fucking metal, even though there are many who will deny it.\n\n\nYeah, this DVD kicks ass. It's honest, and it's damn fun, and even despite crappy quality and also damn bad vocals on the earliest stuff, it's still insanely rocking.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m reviewing the 3 CDs that come with this set, nothing else (seeing how when I bought it, it was just the CDs by themselves without all the extras)\n\nWhat can I say about this album? Well, it\u2019s everything that\u2019s great about live albums, from one of the greats of metal, while still in their prime. This is the live album that everyone should have, not that S&M crap. Sure, the box set is expensive as hell, but if you find the CDs by themselves, you can get it for a very reasonable 25 bucks and I\u2019d highly recommend grabbing it up. \n\nRecorded in Mexico City during Metallica\u2019s peak, this album has everything that a live album should. The audience is loud, there\u2019s some good fun banter between the band and the audience between songs, a little bit of doodling around and some fun crowd participation and a shitload of classic cuts that make this album flow. Sure there\u2019s a bit of an abundance of Black Album material, but considering this was recorded during the tour in support of that album it can be overlooked.\n\nDisc 1 starts things off with the overplayed Enter Sandman, but it\u2019s played with a lot of energy and sounds pretty good. After that they blast out the classic Creeping Death and Harvester of Sorrow, both shredding it up. Then they pull out Sanitarium which sounds decent, but just loses something when put in a live atmosphere. Then we get a few more black album tunes\u2026 they give a good shot at Sad But True, Of Wolf and Man sounds a bit better live and then they slow things down with The Unforgiven (which I believe translates much better live than I would have thought). To finish the disc off we get The Justice Medley\u2026 a medley of just about every song on And Justice that they didn\u2019t already play (besides One which is on the next disc). After that they do a 20 minute bass/guitar solo with a lot of fucking around. The Justice Medley is my favorite on the disc, but I wish they\u2019d cut the solos into like 10 minutes and just played 2 or 3 Justice songs all the way through.\n\nDisc 2 starts off with Through the Never which dose a bang up job of sounding better than the studio cut, partly due to being sped the fuck up and having the guitar solo beefed up. Next they pull out For Whom the Bell Tolls which dose a good job at sounding like the studio version. After that they start playing Fade To Black which sounds excellent, you can feel the energy while listening to it. Next is the God like tune of Master of Puppets, and how could you go wrong with it\u2026 well Metallica will show you how; but cutting the song short and stopping right before the badass solo. However, the first half of the song that they do play dose kick ass\u2026 not to mention the next song gets the royal treatment it deserves. Metallica rips out the oldie Seek and Destroy and do is a helluva lot of justice. And what more could you want after that? Well Whiplash will sure do\u2026 and it fuckin\u2019 shreds hard.\n\nDisc 3 starts off on the low note of Nothing Else Matters, but gets kicked up a bit by Wherever I May Roam. Next up is Am I Evil? which has a shit load of goofing around on it before they bust the actual song out. Of coarse that\u2019s a cover of Diamond Head, but Metallica do a helluva job on it. This disc has a few covers on it, including the next track Last Caress that was originally done by the Misfits. After that Metallica gives us One, which is good\u2026 but I always founded it overrated. I\u2019d much rather heard Blackened off And Justice. After that we get a cover of So What? (originally done by Anti Nowhere League) and Battery both stuck on the same track together, with So What replacing Battery\u2018s mellow intro. Then they do a commendable job of pulling out some old shit n play The Four Horsemen and Motorbreath in excellent form and close the disc off with a cover of Queen\u2019s Stone Cold Crazy.\n\nOverall this 3 Disc set has all the great hits from Metallica before they had a chance to play anything that wasn\u2019t good on a live record. I guess the only real complaint is that there were a few too many Black Album songs and the overlong guitar/bass solo. But if you can get around these small bits, you\u2019ll see Metallica playing classic material in a very energetic fashion. And with the length of this 3 disc set you can easily get around to the shit you wanna hear. Overall, this album has everything you could really want in a live album.\n",
        "\nAs a kind of sequel to \u201cLoad,\u201d the album \u201cReload,\u201d was very similar in several different ways; they were written at about the same time, their styles are very similar in that their vocals, guitars, bass and drums all sound the same. The songs on both albums are quite long; and the songs are all not like classic MetallicA. Many people say that Reload is a collection of songs, which didn't make it onto Load. I don\u2019t thinks this is at all true as Reload in my opinion is a better album then Load, unless Lars and James cant figure out which songs they write are any good. . \n\nOverall Reload is nothing brilliant, the song Slither has a catchy main riff\u2026but it is an extreme rip off of their earlier hit, \u201cEnter Sandman.\u201d If you listen to them both you will hear the extreme similarities in the song; their was even a song on Load that had a very similar sound to Enter Sandman. Fuel has its moments on the radio and has a catchy main chorus, and a pounding \u00be way through section, but the overall song is not very good. For one, the vocals in Fuel are awful\u2026 \u201cAnd I burn, Churning my direction, Quench my thirst with Gasoline\u201d like what the hell does that mean? Metallica\u2019s lyrics used to mean something, but now James has nothing left to sing about. Metallica wrote a classic song called, \u201cThe Unforgiven,\u201d back on the Black album\u2026now they try to be cool by writing a sequel called, The Unforgiven II, which of course is a pretty terrible song. \n\n\u201cWhere the wild things are,\u201d has good drumming and an \u201cok\u201d main chorus, with some interesting guitar riffs, which make it a pretty good song. \u201cCarpe Diem Baby\u201d is a catchy song with some interesting timing, but the name is very lame. \u201cBetter then you\u201d is another sweet song, which seems to roll along and flow very smoothly. The main chorus in \u201cBetter then you,\u201d is sung very well, and the main riff is quite heavy. \u201cBad seed,\u201d is another song that has heavy rhythm parts, and interesting lyrics. \n\nThe best song on the album by far is, \u201cDevil\u2019s Dance,\u201d many people say this song is very un-generic of Metallica, and at times the sound is much different as the song starts out with a catchy bass solo, and the tempo is slower then usual. Following the bass intro, thundering heavy riffs come crashing in carrying a very memorable tune, the lyrics and vocals are very good, the drums are excellent as they keep time perfectly and have a great beat and greatly add to the greatness of this song. DD has a brilliant solo, and one thing I really like about the solo is the way there is a distorted guitar in the background\u2026 the rhythm, which comes thundering in several times. Overall this is an exceptional song, ranking in the top 10\u2019s of my overall favorite Metallica songs (which is a very large list as almost all Metallica is brilliant). \n\nI would say this album is better then \u201cLoad,\u201d but a lot worse then, \u201cThe Black Album,\u201d and a ton better then, \u201cSt Anger.\u201d However Reload still lacks a spark and creativity that old Metallica albums had (except for DD, which I am sure is the last magnificent song Metallica will ever create). If you are a collector of Metallica, \u201cReload,\u201d is worth buying, but it is not a very good album to start up on as it is quite different then original Metallica. And if you hated Load you are likely to hate this album too\n\nHope I have helped you.\n",
        "\nAnother cash grab from the washed-up, self proclaimed \"Kings of Metal\", Metallica. This has got to be the most pointless release of all time, with a tracklist that is identical to the previous EP, but with a worse song as the lead off single. Some Kind of Monster is an 8 minute feature which showcases about 3 riffs, horrid vocals, lame lyrics and the only attempt at a lead guitar line in the whole St.Anger album. It's essentially the same as the St.Anger song, they play the entire song, and then play it again. \n\nIs it just me, or are half of the riffs from St.Anger based around the same (D, F, G) chords? This song, Dirty Window, the last track, Invisible Kid...it's basically the same riff morphed and beaten until it was completely drained of the little integrity that it possessed in the first place.\n\nThe live tracks are a bit better than the studio track, quality and production wise, but it really is painful to be hearing their classic songs at this point, especially with the state that Hetfield's voice is in. The 10 points go to Ride the Lightning, which is done decently. The rest of the songs are shit. \n\nOh yes, the \"free\" t-shirt (I live in Canada, and it's $15 for just the EP and $30 with the shirt). The design is lame, it doesn't fit and the print is cheap. Much like Metallica does these days. I regret spending money on this.\n\nAvoid.\n",
        "\nI hope that before this review gets trashed because of its score and title, a little time will be taken to read why I feel this way about the album in question. I say this because St. Anger is incredibly progressive, not in the 'prog-metal' subgenre (a genre that generally rewards technical ability over creativity) but in music in general. St. Anger marks what has to be the fifth paradigm shift in Metallica's catalogue, leaving behind the alterna-blues metal of Load/Reload for a biting, nihilistic new sound, one that owes more to the abrasive ...And Justice For All than it does modern mainstream metal.\n\nThis album isn't commercial in any way. All of the singles from this album have been stillborn because they don't conform to rock radio, because of the incredibly harsh production job, because of the real aggression on this disc. This is no manufactured rage or desperate attempt to stay current, it is no more and no less than Metallica hardened and burned in the crucible of the ill-fated (and poorly thought out) battle with Napster and the alcoholic self-destruction of one James Hetfield. As illustrated on the powerful Some Kind of Monster documentary, Metallica has been ambushed from all directions; personal problems, record company politics, and the creeping (death) onset of old age that is the most brutal nemesis of any band that can stay together through the years. Thing is, rather than cower behind their legacy and stagnate like many other acts (Priest for example, although I have high hopes for the new album), Metallica has fired back with an album that is really like nothing they, or anyone else, have ever released.\n\nIn many ways St. Anger could be a look at the future of rock, or at least one of the myriad permutations it could travel down. This is an emphasis on stripped-down production (to a highly exaggerated degree), to a music world where picture perfect performances that often lack character are replaced by ragged, scarred-up sessions where raw emotion becomes the key characteristic. It is just as possible that people will find St. Anger extremely distasteful, clanging drums and strangled vocals clawing at long, (perhaps overlong) repetitive, and ugly metal, a new metal that isn\u2019t nu, or if it is at least stripped to that sound\u2019s core and scraped of it\u2019s commercial, cheap, and insincere window dressing, revolutionary healing through bloody abrasions and blackened contusion.\n\nHowever, regardless of how new and frankly exciting (and to be honest, vaguely distasteful) the possibilities, St. Anger is still an album and at that a Metallica album and I didn\u2019t purchase it to hear progression at the expense of music; for that I\u2019d grab Lou Reed\u2019s Metal Machine Music. In my opinion, St. Anger is the worst Metallica studio album (I like it slightly less than Reload), but it remains touched by their unique magic, an album of imposing depth and an enduring feeling of size (like Load) but for the first time in years with a sense of fire in the belly, of a less than slothful drive to stay relevant.\n\nWhen St. Anger is good, it\u2019s very good. \u201cSweet Amber\u201d, in my opinion the best song on the record, gives us a Metallica comfortable with all aspects of their career. It opens with a slow, bluesy version of its main riff which gradually speeds up into some of their 90\u2019s-style speed metal featuring some extremely catchy melodies, lyrics based on the band\u2019s insistence of keeping integrity in the face of pressure from radio conglomerates. Strangely here the albums notoriously wonky production manages to actually approach the warmth of normal music, each instrument pretty much crystal clear, drums sounding more like drums than trash cans, vocals forceful and clear. Even better, the band breaks into what has to be their first true thrash riff in years towards the end of the song, the only thing shackling it to earth and preventing it from soaring into the clouds (with the power of metal, yeah!) being Lars\u2019s resolutely un-speedy drum beat, turning it into a stomping mosh instead.\n\n\u201cSome Kind of Monster\u201d is reminiscent of Justice in that it has quite a few tempo changes and to put it kindly, rocks like a motherfucker. While the lyrics make very little sense (we seem to be describing how to put together a Frankenstein, put what the hell does the \u2018we the people\u2019 bit have to do with anything?) it doesn\u2019t seem to matter because they fit the song, crunchy groove, and chanting alike. I can see this one (like \u201cSweet Amber\u201d) just exploding on stage, because it does possess simple lyrics that just scream for a \u2018scream-along\u2019.\n\nWhile this album isn\u2019t going to give Darkane or Nile (or even Train of Thought) a run for their money in heaviness, there are a couple of seriously brutal numbers in this thing. \u201cPurify\u201d, \u201cDirty Window\u201d, and \u201cAll Within My Hands\u201d are heavy, reasonably fast, and bonecrushing, really evoking a sense of unease through non-obvious, loose playing and a slightly skewed view of metal on the whole. It\u2019s almost as if the drums are the lead instrument, rattling like shaken bones on \u201cPurify\u201d or desperately trying to keep \u201cAll Within My Hands\u201d from collapsing under its own weight (wait?) and ideas.\n\nFor sure, not everything works here. \u201cAll Within My Hands\u201d is simply too underwritten and rambles on for too long, a four minute song excruciatingly stretched to nine, the parts barely fitting together and production somehow worse than usual to complement James being even more unhinged than usual. \u201cShoot Me Again\u201d reeks of nu-melodies, a certain over-dependence of some quite frankly annoying vocal melodies with too many spaces filled by some really weak drum fills. Furthermore, the rehearsal DVD proves quite conclusively that the song just doesn\u2019t work live.\n\nA lot of these songs are simply too long, too many parts repeated too many times, with too little variation. I\u2019m convinced that there is a good song hidden in \u201cSt. Anger\u201d for instance, but that song just has a bunch of catchy, high-quality stuff (like the melodic pre-chorus) that is put together poorly and mixed with some frankly bad ideas (those \u2018flush it outs\u2019 make me wanna just go ahead and die), although the hopeless fanboy in me applauds the reference to early Metallica classics wholeheartedly.\n\nReally, this album has a lot of flaws both intended and accidental. The production of course is awful, but it\u2019s intentional. The lyrics are spotty at best, which is accidental. James is raw, but it\u2019s intentional (and very welcome). The songs meander and have a lot of sections that aren\u2019t really worthy of repetition repeated far too often, which is accidental. Well, not accidental, but bad in a way they seemed to think was good if you follow.\n\nIn any case, I really don\u2019t want another St. Anger (Reverend Irate? Padre Enraged?), but I remain fascinated with what has emerged from the wreckage of this experiment. I look forward to the continuing evolution of metal\u2019s (hell, rock\u2019s) most dynamic and ever changing group, and I\u2019m sure Metallica will not change their ways for me, you, or anything except for the passionate muse that drives them.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Sweet Amber\", \"Some Kind of Monster\", \"Dirty Window\"\n",
        "\nI know what I hate. I don\u2019t hate this. I hate stuff like Guns N\u2019 Roses, who put out shitty, overplayed, overrated pop metal. I hate Axl Rose, who is the epitome of a worthless rock star asshole. I hate fruity flower metal bands like Rhapsody who feel the need to deny the power of the Almighty Riff with their faux-epic disease-ridden keyboards.\n\nThis, on the other hand, is just merely pitiful\u2026not worthy of hate. My, how the mighty have fallen. Metallica were once the undisputed kings of the metal heap, dashing and full of creative energy; now the angst-ridden kings of fraternity-house blues rock. I first heard this about a year ago, hoping it wouldn\u2019t suck. But it did\u2026long and hard. To say I was extremely disappointed is an understatement of epic proportions. I couldn\u2019t form a coherent opinion on it for a long time. But I think I finally have, and the opinion is that this is MEANT to be a pitiful, worthless album\u2026an exorcism of sorts, as Pyrus commented. This is meant to wallow in the depths of misery, self-pity and angst. And as an experiment in that, it has no equal\u2026it is in a class by itself. And thus, it is not metal. Metal is meant to be full of mad creative brilliance, to be crazy and full of energy, to play on 11 and not give a fuck. It is everything that is righteous, good, true, and \u201coh hell yes!\u201d about the world.\n\nSt. Anger, on the other hand, makes me think of what might happen if an emo band had even an ounce of attitude and tried to be emotional without being COMPLETELY poppy and wishy-washy. It might have been interesting, but it comes off as disjointed, a mess, a complete musical train wreck. And since that is the point of the album, then I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty damn good at what it does.\n\nSo what\u2019s bad about this album? Most everything, really. And it\u2019s all been said before, so I\u2019ll try to be brief. The production, for starters. This has been termed as \u201craw\u201d by some. Bullshit, I say. \u201cRaw\u201d is Motorhead \u2013 Sacrifice. \u201cRaw\u201d is Dark Angel \u2013 Darkness Descends. \u201cRaw\u201d is Venom \u2013 Black Metal. \u201cRaw\u201d is Hellhammer \u2013 Apocalyptic Fucking Raids. St. Anger is merely \u201cgreasy.\u201d Amateurish, too.\n\nWhat else? The performances. Debasing, awful, worthless. James\u2019 vocals are anguished and pitiful. Kirk\u2019s guitar skills are nonexistent. And is that Lars behind the drums, or a monkey rapping on a tin can?\n\nWhat else? The songs. Some have their redeeming moments. For instance, when I first heard \u201cFrantic,\u201d I remember thinking \u201cOh goody, they\u2019re back to metal!\u201d Nope\u2026I was disappointed within the next ten seconds. But the riff was there. And here, and there, scattered throughout the album. The songs are a complete roller coaster ride through the not-so-lofty heights of solid blues-thrash riffage through the abysmal depths of mallcore-riff and masturbatory guitar-noodling hell. As far as this train wreck goes, the best songs include Sweet Amber, for the afore-mentioned blues-thrash riffage; the Unnamed Feeling, for it\u2019s grinding angst and basically out-emoing every emo band on the face of Satan\u2019s green Earth; and All Within My Hands, for its kind-of-epicness, and maybe one of the \u201cbetter\u201d vocal performances on this goofy album. But on the whole, they are all pretty awful and worthless.\n\nBut on that note, I should say that that is what this album was meant to be\u2026an exploration of feelings of worthlessness, angst, self-hatred, rage; things that are far too prevalent in the world today. It is a sort of timely commentary, is it not?\n\nSo yes, St. Anger is everything negative that people say about it. It is probably the worst \u201cmetal\u201d album ever created. And yes, Metallica are more than likely lost to the metal world forever. But in a strange, perverted way, St. Anger is actually quite good at what it is supposed to do. That is just about the mildest form of a complement that I can give this. I can\u2019t like it. But it\u2019s not beyond me to give St. Anger a little respect.\n",
        "\n(note to admin: This is a resubmission, since I feel the original review i wrote was juvenile, innacurate and a poor description of the album itself. Please delete the original one I wrote.)\n\nIn 1983, when this was unleashed upon the world, Metallica had already built up a huge reputation around the bay area. Word of mouth about the band was buzzing around various cities on the west coast as well. From the onset, it was hinted at that this band would become huge eventually.\n\nOne listen of this album shows that Metallica were listening to a lot of Venom and Motorhead at the time of this release. It had the punk attitude and aggression that was simultaneous with both bands, but there was a slightly more metallic crunch to them, as Venom had poor production qualities that overshadowed the effect of the guitar skills and Motorhead was more like fast rock n roll that many metalheads loved. \n\nHighlights of the album include The Four Horsemen for its galloping rhythm and complex song structure. No Remorse was also great because of its crunching heavy beginning and its high speed thrash section near the end, and Metal Milita had some of the best riffs Metallica had written.\n\nNot all of the album is great though. Hit the Lights is a bit repetitive, even though the great riffs make up for it, and Seek and Destroy can get quite boring, as it hardly goes anywhere other than the faster section in the middle. I dont mean to jump on the \"metallica bashing\" bandwagon, but I think it was Dave Mustaine who made Kill em All a truly great classic, as he wrote some of the better songs. \n\nOverall, though this is an album that shouldn't be overlooked because of Metallica's new reputation as money grubbing corporate sellouts. Yes, it is thrash metal, and yes it is the template for the bay area thrash to follow (Testament, Death Angel etc. owe something to this album).\n",
        "\nThis is probably the best little record the old farts of Metallica have released in some time now. Sadly, the title track of the short single release is a cover from the legendary Misfits. Metallica actually do a pretty smash-up job of hammering out the riffwork on this version - even if James Hetfield just can't nail Glenn Danzig's wonderful dulcet tones. Metallica pile through this with appropriate wrath, making it an interesting addition to what has been a weak (understatement) set of releases.\n\nThe other tracks are the typical Metallica add-on single dare with the live and unreleased stuff just sitting around looking for someone to slap it up on the b-sides. Nothing much to see here, unless you love the latest releases and want alternate versions to drown yourself in.\n\nMetallica keep trudging on...even if they have no clue how far they've fallen in terms of preserving their legacy. This may have been a minor step in the right direction - but it didn't cure the fact that the heaviest song they had released in yers up till this point was a song they hadn't even written.\n\nhttp://www.metallica.com\n",
        "\nMany people I talked to said that S&M was another Metallica masterpiece and being my favorite band by a long way I bought the album\u2026 I expected it to be good\u2026I love orchestral-metal like the works of Therion and Nightwish; but some bands just are not meant to be orchestral-metal\u2026 or are they.\n\nI have several reasons why this unique Metallica Album is a waste of time. Although this album covers most of their best songs it has not one of their songs from their first album, \u201cKill \u2018Em All,\u201d which was a very classy album. I never heard any of the deep purple live stuff so I cant judge it; but obviously the Metallica songs played at S&M were not meant to be played with an orchestra. Whoever it was\u2026James, Lars and Michael Kamen, who likely added the orchestral parts into the original metallica songs, probably did as good a job as possible adding in the orchestra; but this did not work very well. I have no problem with classical music but in my opinion you cannot \"ADD\" it to Metal music. For Orchestral-metal to work they need to be written together. Like Therion for example, it almost seems like the metal was written for the symphony. I would like someday to see a big name band like Metallica try and play some kind of classical music using their metal guitars. \n\nI think that Metallica have potential to write more orchestral-metal like their one song The Call Of Ktulu\u2026 it sound very dark and has some kind of symphony sound too it. Another interesting thing that I think works very well is classical instruments playing metal songs alone not with the metal guitars in the background\u2026A good Example of this \u201cApocalyptica.\u201d I quite enjoy their stuff; it\u2019s very different and I can see how many people can\u2019t quite imagine how \u201cEnter Sandman,\u201d would sound good on a cello, but if you listen to it with an open mind you will see how it is extremely creative and actually sounds quite good. \n\nSo overall S&M sounded like a normal Metallica concert but the orchestral sound cluttered up the background, this album was a waste of time. However it may open up some more opportunities for Metal music of all garners being combined with Orchestral and classical music.\n",
        "\nIf you don't own the Unnamed Feeling EP, bump this is up about 30 points. It'd be worth getting for you.\n\nHOWEVER, if you like me have both, you're probably feeling a little jipped. I bought SKOM without looking at the tracklist, and now I am feeling a little out of shape. They released the EP again save for switching the St.Anger tracks. This is really unacceptable. They don't have anymore exclusive live tracks? No out-takes or covers or unreleased songs?\n\nNo other release in their catalogue seems like a play for cash at all, but this, this is something that goes beyond. Selling this as a new release is pathetic and meanspirited. Shame on Elektra and you know what, shame on Metallica\n\nStand-Outs: None applicable, all of the songs have been heard before and you probably know what songs you really like anyway.\n",
        "\nThe song 'the unamed feeling' is one the worst examples of why the new album was so weak and universally panned. Horrible chugging riffs, lack of present and deep drumming, weak, rough and placid vocals. The song was never worthy of album, let alone single material.\n\nEp's as far as I am aware are chock full of the rare. ON Iron Maiden's 'No More Lies' you got mulitmedia videos, rare studio cuts, a commemorative wristband. in Iced earth's 'Melancholy EP' you got rare and since unreleased covers plus the exceptionally rare live rendtion of 'colours'\n\nOn this Ep you get the studio cut of 'unnamed feeling' and then hordes of live tracks. Only a couple of which are that rare or even special. They had the chance here to chuck in a few garage era demos, the infamous 'boom box' live recordings, remastered footage from 'Cliff 'em all'... But nope, all we got were soundboard recordings of tracks from the last tour, which if anyone is familiar with the 'frantic' single will see were available there.\n\nfor die hard fans who collect everything then this is for you, or if you want what is in theory an up to date mini-live album then it is worth picking up. But I don't know this could have had so much more thrown into it, a shame and a waste really.\n",
        "\nIts hard to see how they could have made this album anything short of amazing. But its Metallica, and they manage. Now, Metallica does have an incredibly kick ass live sound. Even some of their more mediocre songs sound quite good live. As this was recorded after the Black Album, we luckily do not need to hear anything of Load, Reload, or St. Anger. There is also the abundance of this package: Three discs, and two live concerts on video. Pretty damn good. There are however, several problems with this album; namely, pretty bad song selection, annoying talking and fucking around seconds, and stupid tracks where we are subjected to Kirk Hammett and Jason Newstead noodling around on the guitar and bass for way too long.\n\nStart with the first Disc. Immediately, we can see the mediocre song selection: Enter Sandman? Sad But True? Justice Medley? Why can't they just play full songs (Justice Medley) instead of subjecting us to a little teaser of a song? Enter Sandman doesn't sound that bad live, but Sad But True and still definitely sucks. We are then subjected to a shitload of crappy bass and guitar solos. No. However, there is also Creeping Death, which sounds amazing live, as well as Harvester of Sorrow, which would be very good if they didn't completely stop the song for thirty seconds in the middle of the song. Not a very good first CD.\n\nThe second CD is much better, with some of Metallica's best. Whiplash sounds phenomenal live, and will cause you to headbang like hell. Seek and Destroy, Through the Never, For Whom the Bell Tolls... and of course Fade to Black all sound betetr than their studio versions. Puppets could have been great too... but they take the second half out. Bad idea. But this is definitely the best of the CDs on this album. Very little screwing around. \n\nThe third disc is also quite good, with an amazing Diamond Head cover of Am I Evil that sounds better than the original and an excellent Queen cover of Stone Cold Crazy. We also get The Four Horsemen, Motorbreath, and Battery, which is kind of ruined by all the fucking around they do before getting into the song.\n\nThe Seattle 89' video kicks incredibly amounts of ass. Now that's a great setlist. Once again, there is lots of screwing around, but it really is a good concert. The San Diego video from 92 pretty much has the same strengths and weaknesses of the album.\n\nIf you are a die hard Metallica fanboy, or even just a regular fan, you will definitely want to pick this up. It is frustrating, though, that something that could have easily been one of the best live albums ever was just good.\n",
        "\nI joined the Metal Archives fairly recently, so I didn't get a chance to do a St. Anger review (it would've received an 84), so this is the next best thing. What you've got here is one of the better songs on St. Anger (issue \"Sweet Amber\" as a single dammit!) plus a bunch of really solid live cuts. Whatever you say about Metallica, they've always gotten the job done live, and they've been really on for this tour, much more so than the rather limp performance captured on the S&M album and DVD.\n\nI'll start with the title track. Like the album itself, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe Unnamed Feeling\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd owes itself to both old and new Metallica. It's sort of a statement on the metal scene in general in that regard. We sit in the middle of a paradigm shift in metal history. The definitions are changing. Just as the 80's metal crew started declassifying traditional metal like Aerosmith into the vague \"hard rock\" category. now metalheads, the hardcore ones, are starting to re-visualize the genre, to expand it's boundaries. But there are some who resist. Fuck you, maybe SlipKnot and Disturbed are louder, faster, and harder than anything Iron Maiden ever put out but I'll be damned if I call them metal. They are \"hardcore\", \"metalcore\", or worst of all \"mallcore\". Pffft.\n\nSt.Anger is not a hardcore album, \"The Unnamed Feeling\" is not a mallcore song. It's a metal record. On the whole the St.Anger got more in common with traditional metal than with The Deftones, but still it's being flayed for being progressive and new. We may look back and find out that St.Anger is a true landmark in the progression of metal. But maybe it won't, so let me step off of my soap box and talk about the release at hand.\n\nLike every other Metallica song (except \"2x4\") it's good, and in fact \"The Unnamed Feeling\" is probably one of the best songs they've ever done. Fuck calling this nu-metal. No nu-metal act hits this hard, feels this passionate, is built so raw. It'd be like calling Accept a hair band because they have a singer with a high pitched voice. Make no mistake, the St. Anger record shares some common characteristics with nu-metal, and as a fervent hater of Linkin Park and company, and all they represent, it upsets me a bit. But I look beyond.\n\nI see this as a throw back to both \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdUntil it Sleeps\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. James is at the top of his game with little of the slightly punky tone he'd acquired by Reload. This a real a gem of a performance throughout over a truly rocking riff that has that slow but unstoppable feeling of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNo Leaf Clover\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd or \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe Outlaw Torn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd, with lyrics that, while reminiscent of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdUIS\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd are among the most dependably solid on the record(sorry boys, but not every song here is \"One\"). It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a straight ten, even if James does a passable Jonathan Davis impression towards the end of the song. The difference is that while KoRn bitches and moans so much that it loses its power within the first twenty seconds, this comes after a singularly forceful performance by Het and feels much more honest and exposed. Of course, I love Metallica so what do I know?\n\nOf course, if you're one of those who despises new Metallica in any form, the live stuff is still well worth the price of admission. \"The Four Horsemen\" kicks into overdrive like nobody's business, and you can practically see Dave Mustaine moping about how \"Mechanix\" was really never as good. \"Damage Inc.\" has always been one of the most intense Metallica numbers, truly shredding the melodic elements that had started to creep into the band's music by the time Master of Puppets came out, and the band does it justice here.\n\nAlthough it was much publicized that Lars didn't even touch his double-bass live on this song in recent years, he doesn't skimp on it here. I've never really loved this song, but it is a convincing chugger with great lyrics. Don't forget \"Motorbreath\" either, always one of the better songs on Kill 'Em All I felt. I still don't think they need to do every song from it on this tour, but people have missed it after such a long absence so... \n\n\"Ride the Lightning\" works very effectively live, and it makes you wonder how they dropped it from the set for so many years. Did you really need to play \"Nothing Else Matters\" so often? \"Hit the Lights\" has such a great chorus, and the punky vibes of the verses work even better now than they did before. Well worth a spin, particularly for it's huge historical significance.\n\nIn the end, this is not an essential release, but it is a good one. The songs could be better chosen, but I'm sure classic thrash-heads will get all misty eyed for tender youth and lost brain cells. A good combo of new and old, but not a great one. Perhaps if Tallica had added more really interesting material (out-takes anyone?) rather than simply dipping into the back catalogue again this\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be worth it.\n\nHowever, I will not be nearly so kind towards the next EP of this nature.\n\nStand-Outs: Meh, it's a bunch of classic live tracks and a really good new song, just like the SKOM EP. You already know what you like I should think.\n",
        "\nRide the Lightning. The quintessential thrash album, and for good reason. With a teenage genre of thrash metal out, this record was a little gift to it, hence my review name. Long in the shadows of its little brother, Master of Puppets, this is the true prime cut of the Glorytallica days. With kick-your-ass thrashterpieces, and deep, power epics, Ride has all of it and more. ...And Justice For All is the true showing of technical ability for Metallica, yet this release proves they can play meaningful songs, which alter how you feel just by the (numerous) riffs. Let's go in for a closer look, shall we?\n\nOpening, we get a... GASP! Acoustic guitar intro?! Hey, this isn't half bad. \"Fight Fire With Fire\"starts off with a melodic, acoustic intro. Sounds almost Celtic, and right as you start enjoying the peacefulness, the bliss. BAM! Right into the gut-wrenching riffs. The maniacal riffing goes on, and I have to admit, James sounds somewhat weak when the lyrics, \"Do unto others asthey've done to you...\" As the sonic riffing assault continues, the lyrics reveal a story of two powerhouse countries in a nuclear battle frenzy, The Cold War: Gone Bad, if you will. Overall, this song is just a sonic assault thrash number that gives everything you'd come to expect in tip-top condition. My only gripe for this number is the simplistic, barbarous drumming. All I couldexpect from Lars, though.\n\nOh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Time for the best song on the entire record, that's right, the title track, \"Ride The Lightning!\" This time, there is less breakneck speed, yet more strength. A song about a man who is soon going to be executed (Or so the slumberer thinks,) yet he is going to be electricuted for a crime he did not commit. Somewhat similiar to, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name,\" nevertheless very original. The intro riff (Which has Mustaine written all over it,) is something of epic proportions. Seriously, if someone made a single with just this riff being played in an eighty minute loop, I'd be the first to buy it. Anyway, I can suck the intro \nriffs balls all day, let's go into further detail. Going into less metallic, more crunching riffs, this area features some solid drum fills, and James barks out the lyrics. It features a blow-delivering solo, and then a frantic breakdown section, then goes to more more verse, then the chorus again. Excellent song.\n\nThe Bells Toll For Thee, Chimey! Metallica's track that's Everyone knows when this song is coming, when you hear the bells ringing enchantingly in the intro, it's just the vibrations in the ground warning you of the 18-wheeler Mac truck coming. Soon after, CHICAPOW! The riffing starts, and it chugs and chugs away, with a very cool lead. The riffs leave you feeling a sense of extreme nervousness, a large build-up of what will come to be. James starts singing the magically crafted lyrics, a track about war. Repeat, and then we enter a slow breakdown, with those lovable bells chiming. And the -- The fuck? It's already over. MAKE IT LONGER!!!\n\nNext up, Fade to Black. Fade to Black, indeed, of my eyes drooping. This song is SO BORING. Sometimes, boring is good, though. This song is about a man who feels he is a nescient, worthless human being and that he is leeching from the world. For him, the expression, \"Looks like suicide is your only option.\" doesn't even begin to cover his angst ridden pain. I have to admit though, the solos are very well done, an admirable job from Kirky, one of his better performances. The solos themselves are excellent, and sometimes even that crazy \"B\" word, beautiful. While the acoustics are forgettable, the solos are excellently made, yet you have to take into consideration the slow pace. Some pretty good thrash breakdowns, but nothing too special. Another breakdown, this time much larger then all the others, and lasts for the rest of the song. James tries to sing well, and he actually comes out sounding halfway decent! The man can't hold a note, though. The song fades out with a ripping solo, and with that, it's done.\n\nKirk Hammett killed this song. Trapped Under Ice, killed in its prime of life. Is it still excellent? Yes, definetley some postmortem asskicking going on here. What we have here, is a song that had excellent everything. Excellent drumming, excellent riffage, excellent tempo, excellent rhythm, excellent originality, excellent lyrics, excellent lead . . . - STOP RIGHT THERE. Oh, wait, it was the lead that killed this. Kirk Hammett is an average guitarist, and when he wanks the whammy in between EVERY SINGLE ODIN FORSAKEN VERSE, argh, you just lose respect for it. If it wasn't for the lead, and the obstacle known as Creeping Death, this would have been the number one song. Oh well. Maybe they can do this song over again on a later date.\n\nI think the solo for Escape it like a drug, let the end of Enter Sandman's. The more you hear it, the more you crave it. Anyway, a midpacer with no true meaning to it, but varies with what it sounds like. Riffs that stick to your mind, and verses that do the same, there is not much to say about Escape. This is not thrash, this is not great, this is not bad. This is good.\n\nOh. My. Fucking. BRM (BRM is God.). Creeping Death. This is my all-time favorite song, tied with HBTN, and for excellent reasoning. Not enough can be said, not enough justice can be delivered for this masterful song. Not beautiful at all, and not out to impress you. This song just keeps on shooting you in the face, with dual .44 magnums. This song is one whole thrashgasm, and easily the best live song I have ever heard and seen. Symphony X could write a three hundred minute ode to this number, and would not capture its essence. Starting out with a biblical, crushing riff, it leads into another biblical sounding riff, which also happens to be my favorite riff of all time. A short drum solo, followed by some more riffing with excellent fills, the infamous pause....and...... Slaves! Hebrews born to serve, to the pharoah! The awesome as fuck lyrics begin, and James starts to polish this song off with a nice coating of, \"Ass-raping with a fucking baseball.\" The lyrics are written to portray the badassery and asskickery that is the latter half of The Ten Commandments, despite it's bible-bonking lyrical themes, it is the most badass song Metallica has made. Repeat another verse, and then Kirk Hammett's second best solo, rounding it off with another slower solo...\n\nSo short, yet so sweet. The bridge, which is for me, the best moment ever to be found in a song. With a slow/medium tempo to it, this delivers a powerful, wolvenlike riff to it. This sections hold so much power, it is incredible. The headbanging that it produces, the moshing it creates, and the defining point in all music it has become for me. Just by reading this, most people would know I'm talking about, what it is commonly reffered to as, \"THE MOTHERFUCKING DIE BY MY MOTHERFUCKING ASSHOLERAPING HAND!\" part. The section lasts around forty-five seconds recorded, but when you are there, attending a concert live, the played out three minutes of this becomes the longest orgasm you've ever had. It's the simple, tribal, warrior like riff that makes this section so unforgettable, and forget it I never will. Oh yeah, and then some crazy chorus with an outro riff and solo. Pfft, who needs it? \n\nNow for what is the greatest instrumental for Metallica, \"The Call of Ktulu,\" I'd just like to personally insult Metallica for a second. You idiots, you imbeciles. How could you place such a badass song after the GREATEST SONG EVER? OK, I'm done. Anyway, to the song, it starts with an atmospheric, melodic intro. Then all of a sudden, you feel yourself liking it, and IT'S A BOMB! The song just starts, out of no where. Not much can be said, seeing as I can't write about something if there are no lyrics, or Hell, I'd be content with the sounds of a constipated man struggling to get a 15 pound shit out. Just great riffs, more simple drumming for Lars, great solos, and a nice way to end the album.\n\nThere we go, the best Metallica album. Chances are you've already got this album, or if not, you've pirated it. If not, what are you waiting for, Christmas? Get it you heathen!\n",
        "\nUnlike the majority of St. Anger, I find this song to be quite consistent with the exception of that tic-toc chorus. Just ignore that blemish, this is much improved from most of their really new material. Starts off with a fast, allbeit not overly great guitar riff and builds up pretty well. The drums arent half as irritating as most of the work. Would have developed better if they cut the intro a bit but the softer guitar tone for the transition riff worked pretty well. The second riff is very good for new Metallica standards. Verse is pretty standard, nothing overly interesting but it is catchy and leads to an interesting clean guitar riff(not the same damn riff) and great vocal melody when James sings \"keep searchin\". \n\nIt then falters a bit with the infamous Frantic-tic-toc-tic-toc line. I've learned to live with it somewhat but I'll admit its not that great and perfectly understandable people dont like it much. But thats not the only aspect of this song. Of course this song could be better, Metallica 6 minute songs without solo's can always be better. My point is that this song for the most part is catchy and even though not filled with excellent riffs and irresistable melodies, it still has some solid music and memorable vocal lines which is more than I can say for most of Metallica's new material.\n",
        "\nIt takes some DAMN GOOD reasoning to give this album such a low rating. The zero implies the absolute nadir of musicality, a level that can only be dreamt of by mere mortals as Fred Durst and your blender. What in Satan's name could this album have done to deserve such a low rating?? It pretty much singlehandedly ENDED heavy metal, that's what. Now, on a strictly musical level, I would give this album a 62 or so. It's not bad. It really isn't. It's certainly not as bad as Saint Anger, proud owner of a former record-low \"3%\" rating. It's not even as bad as the album that would follow it, And Justice for All, and when all is said and done, it pretty much sums up the averageness of the thrash movement perfectly.\n\nFirst off, it is where shit really starts to fall apart for Metallica as a band. At this point, you can see the impending death - not just bodily, but creative as well. They are out of Mustaine riffs, and Hetfield isn't exactly the smartest, cleverest cookie in the box, and he's forced to scramble and improvise, so out comes one bashing thrasher, a few more assorted riffs here and there, and then all kinds of half-assed and half-baked ideas that pretty much do not belong in Heavy Metal, the land of the free, the home of the brave... unfortunately, the world caught on to THIS album, this expression of vapidity, and decided that THIS was the way to go.\n\nThis album is the Nirvana \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" of heavy metal. It brought heavy metal to its knees, and castrated it mightily. It is, then, by definition, the most damaging, counterproductive, and overrated LP ever to be released. Even standing it up on its own, and not letting it poison the minds of those that came after it, I wouldn't even put it in the top 10 most influential thrash releases of 1986... it's easily killed by the unholy trinity of Darkness Descends, Reign in Blood, and Pleasure to Kill, which pushed the envelope of metal in three different, related directions. It's not anywhere nearly as enjoyable as expatriate Mustaine's Peace Sells, which was technically brilliant and a whole barrel of fun too, or as dark as Possessed's sophomore effort, or Sepultura and Sodom's full-length debuts. It's not nearly as punk-as-fun as Nuclear Assault's first. Then I could throw in fifteen, if not fifty, other backwash thrash LPs that did nothing for the genre as far as influence goes, but are still a whole fuckload more enjoyable than this one.\n\nSo... the songs. There is some ownage here. Battery, for example, is fucking heavy, and works brilliantly well, as a destroyer of worlds. The title track is a bit more calculated, with its main riff gronked from one of the Metal Church demos (also \"Over My Dead Body\"), and but it dies for a bit in that little Hetfield noodle section in the middle. Say what you will, that part is dumb, and a harbringer of what is to come. Not just because it is dumb, but because it is hailed as visionary - not just on the album, but with this band, and with metal in general. This album didn't do ANYTHING make metal a better, more viable genre... hell, by 1986, everything that was good about metal was pretty much established, it was just a matter of time before all the stupid ideas reared their ugly fucking heads and turned the scene into self-parody. From the inane mindless riff-ennui of Jon Schaffer and Iced Earth, to the stupid dynamic mismanagement of a million bands, ranging from misplaced melodicism of the Gothenburg scene to the awful monotony of Opeth... all of these can be traced back to the vast commercial success of this album. Being \"less than thrash\" was viewed as a Good Thing. Less than over-the-top, less than expanding the genre, less than creative, less than heavy fucking metal. And of course, as is the human tendency to accept mediocrity, because excellence requires actual EFFORT... people jumped right on this very fucking album. They saw that they did not have to put out an all-out Bonded by Blood thrashfucking mindfuck, or even the complex harmonic beauty of stuff like Peace Sells, with its shredding solos and powerful interludes. If they just put in a obligatory Slow Solo Section, a la Suck Hetfield, they would be accepted as correct by their metal brethren. Rah, rah, put up the horns, thank you for being bland. A thousand Nevermores were spawned by THIS album. \n\nThird song... this probably is the parodic equivalent of Black Sabbath here. Because Black Sabbath were midpaced, creative, and heavy. This is midpaced, boring, and plodding. There is nothing to this song, and of course, it would be viewed as a fucking staple of the \"groove-thrash\" movement. Robbb Flynnn, he whose contributions to excess are merely putting extra letters on the end of his first name, probably ejaculated twice as hard when he heard this song - and realised he could play shitty and get away with it - than in ANY other time of his life, and that includes his entire career in Vio-lence. This very well may be the song that spawned Machine Head, and of course when Hetfield, through the wall-of-saliva incident, corrupted Diamond Darrell into being a groove monkey, spawned modern Pantera too.\n\nNext up, a cheesy ballad, Sanitarium, which again contains soft sections for the sake of having soft sections. Of course, proper use of dynamics had been completely, TOTALLY invented by about 1976... if Sabotage didn't have it, then Sad Wings certainly did, and anyone claiming to add something new to the idea was pretty much full of hot air. Maybe Rainbow's \"Stargazer\" can lay a small claim to things, a small claim to have added SOMETHING. And Sanitarum adds nothing. That said, it does not even play the standard cards correctly - there are tons of songs that start off soft and then build up to a frenzied crescendo, and most of them are far more effective than this. See Helstar's \"Winds of War\" for a perfect example, or even the previous LP's \"Fade to Black\" for one that works decently well. But of course, there is \"Megalomania\". And then there is this crap. And that's what this is - unmitigated crap, masquerading as thrash, but being plodding, boring, modern bullshit. This song has absolutely no balls whatsoever. And heavy metal is about BALLS. It's about riffs, it's about smashing a spike through the brains of the listener, making him/her/it perk up and die hard. It's about the slow, twisting zombie passages of Triumph of Death. It's about the flash and the colour and the violence of Chainsaw Charlie. It's about the constant multidirectional bludgeon of From the Past Comes the Storms. It's CERTAINLY NOT about Hetfield moaning \"leave me be...\" like a thousand other assrape victims to come. But, unfortunately, this is what the world caught onto. This is the illusion that destroyed reality, the feeble cry of patheticness in the night, that virally castrated a powerful genre. Because as Possessed and D.F.A. and up-and-coming bands like Death and Nocturnus were constantly playing loud, proud, and heavy and expanding the genre... and as a thousand other bands like Iron Maiden and Helloween were consistently waving the banner of Judas Fucking Priest... as all of those bands demonstrated vibrancy and life, here was THIS virus, this awful plague of self-mocking stupidity, that slowly corrupted the whole thing from within. And people wonder what happened to metal? People wonder why years like 1993 came along, and why horrendous, backwards bands like Lamb of God and Damage Plan are now on the forefront of the scene? People WONDER - no, it was inevitable, that the mediocrity would rise and destroy everything in its path. All it took was for the metal scene to be inundated with this backwash crap, this horrendous assault that seems so soothing, so relaxing... so \"it's OKAY if you suck, junior\", so Kurt Cobain before Kurt Cobain himself. Look, this band sucks too, and look at the instant popularity they have. Gresham's Law is a harsh mistress.\n\nSo yes, maybe I was mistaken. Maybe this is the album that should be lauded as the avant-garde of the metal scene of 1986. Forget Dark Angel's 286 beats per minute of ultimate heaviness, throw away Reign in Blood's chaotic assault on the senses, and certainly avoid thinking about Pleasure to Kill's death-metal tendencies. Oh no no, none of THOSE albums did jack shit for the metal genre, because the metal genre is OF COURSE about technological backwardsism, insipidity, and playing turned to \"4\", because only losers like Motorhead play, eat, drink, fuck, sleep, etc... on \"11\". Save the aggression for the Jager sessions, right Hetfield? The actual music needs to be a complete fucking lullaby. Horror of horrors - though mathematically inevitable of course - the metal genre ate this bullshit up. Again, look at the top bands in pop metal today... the uninspired Iced Earth, who have not had a good idea since 1994, of course proudly declare that early Metallica is their foremost influence. The godawful Machine Head, as mentioned before - groove-monkeys to the core. The lame Testament, who were, other than their lead guitarist, a few screw turns loose in the creativity department - their The New Order (a \"thrash classic\", my ass) is pretty much a fourth-rate Master of Puppets ripoff, and their latest stuff takes ideas that were more heavily present on this LP, and less so on others. \n\nFifth up is Disposable Heroes, eight minutes of thrash, showing that, if pressed, the band could still deliver the goods. This, along with Battery, is the highlight of the album. It's competent thrash a la 1984 or 1985, except maybe a bit overlong. That said, if you think this has crushing riffage, you have not heard Exodus's Piranha. Again, if the album were all like this, then it would be an average thrasher, not unlike a thousand others that came out in this year. See Death Angel's \"The Ultraviolence\" for a quick example. Following Disposable Heroes is the clearly Mustaine-written - at least, in the interesting parts, anyway - Leper Messiah. That middle break is so completely Killing/Peace Sells that the fact that Hetfield could even barely begin to claim that he and Ulrich wrote the song is promptly ludicrous, and more so a flat out fucking lie. I can see Hetfield writing the plodding, Should Not Be-esque beginning and end of the song, but that middle section has the Mark of Dave. I have no idea how this band managed to assign songwriting credits, but the idea of Ulrich coming up with songs is laughable. It is this little fucking troll that can personally be shown to be the anti-metal figure. No, not just because of Napster. Not because of the black album, and Bob Rock, and a thousand other crimes against humanity in the 1990s. He had a hand on THIS album too. Hetfield, by himself, would probably been happy penning silly odes to bludgeonry, a thousand Batteries, each with a slightly lower voltage than the last, and the band would have died its appropriate death by mediocrity. Kublai Khan, anyone? No one's heard of Kublai Khan, and no one should have ever heard of Metallica after 1984 or so. They just got incredibly lucky that Ulrich got kicked out of Metal Church in 1980, and had nothing to do with the east coast scene, where Overkill was busy declaring that they just didn't give a fuck. They just wanted to play live, and repeatedly they compromised their good business sense to continue doing so. Quite a sad thing, that Overkill shot themselves in the face with their selling of their demo to Azra Records for booze money, but when all is said and done, THAT attitude is BY FAR more The Metal Way than anything Metallica could have done. Overkill didn't give a fuck, and just played cranked to 11, finishing their set with Tyrant, and recognising Joey Ramone and Lemmy Kilmister as the twin gods of excess and everything that is right and \"fuck yeah!\" about the world. Then, there was Megadeth, with Mustaine, who instantly, at the very moment the band was founded, or maybe even before then... when Mustaine was sent back to San Francisco on that four-day bus trip, THAT is when Megadeth became a better band than Metallica would ever be, because Mustaine was right pissed off, and he would outdo, outgun, and outriff the band that had jilted him, because that is the metal way, to be over-the-top and full of dashing creative energy. \n\nMetallica had none of this. Maybe, at the beginning, they had whatever they could steal from their Venom and Diamond Head LPs. Unfortunately, Hetfield probably had his heart in the right place, but he was a complete fucking pussy. He felt the need to declare between songs in 1985 that he would not be saying the words \"ooh baby\" and wearing lipstick. Paul Baloff took the battle to the other side, issuing an ultimatum to anyone in the crowd wearing a RATT shirt. Bobby Blitz just didn't even mention it, letting the songs do the talking. He was \"leaving the poseurs behind\". Hetfield just stood on the stage and sulked, because Ulrich was busy cutting his heart out. Ulrich, who had not a whit of songwriting sense to him... he was kicked out of Metal Church in '80 because his drumming was nonexistent at best. He of course had the spark of marketing, where he landed himself a deal on a compilation without a band, or anything other than flyers of Saxon at the Whiskey. And he knew, that the way to make it to the top was not the way of Possessed, because Possessed were too heavy and too rough to be anything but a cult band. He knew that the way to the top was to scheme and to cover one's self in a heavy dose of bullshit. Then, he got lucky, because he had a pal named Hetfield, that really wanted to kill all the record label executives, and combine Hetfield's true extravagance with Ulrich's poseurism, and what you got was a band that appeared to be rebellious. Throw in Cliff Burton's hippie tendencies, and Kirk Hammett's irrelevance, and the image was complete. And at the beginning, the band did have the metal madness, when they wrote silly odes to Weapon like Hit the Lights - empty of social relevance, but completely heavy FUCKING metal. Thanks, Hetfield and Tanner. It's not hard to be a metal kid, and at the beginning, Hetfield was a metal kid. Then Ulrich slowly but surely turned him into a puppet. The album title can be viewed as a proud declaration of Ulrich's conquest of Hetfield, of Metallica, and eventually of the entire scene. The little troll infused mediocrity, and slowly burned the world from the inside out. Hetfield became a raging alcoholic, hanging on to whatever riffs he could remember stealing from Mustaine. Burton's hippie-rock, which was fine for what it is, but had no place in metal whatsoever, soon became the overriding creative force in the band, and of course had to be recognised, because Ulrich knew that if he approved another Hell Awaits, the scene would bury him fast. And of course, it would be ludicrous to imply that he was one-ten-thousandth the drummer the Lombardo was.\n\nSo along came Master of Puppets. Random hippie crap, combined with a few random recycled Mustaine moments, all held together by the glue of Hetfield's average riff constructions - perfectly suitable for an average, mediocre, fifth-rate garage thrash ensemble. And Ulrich's megalomania, that realised that this steaming pile of directionless garbage was THE universal solution to bringing him fame. Not that it was any good - precisely because it WASN'T. Because it was mediocre, any idiot with an axe could be like Hetfield now, and if Ride the Lightning sold a whole fuckload of copies, then Master of Puppets, on inertia alone, would sell a whole fuckload more, and thus the seed was set. And that, my friends, is why Lars Ulrich is the worst thing ever to happen to heavy fucking metal.\n\nAfter the obligatory Mustaine composition comes the long section of hippie crap, that is not only the worst song on the album, but THE final stake through the heart of heavy metal. I hear Orion, and I hear Opeth. I hear a heap of shit that is labelled \"progressive\" and \"visionary\", but is really a space-filler. A throwback to the 1960s and the 1970s - stuff that Black Sabbath quickly moved away from, and used only in small amounts. Progressive rock was dangerous stuff, to be used in form only, not in actual substance. Careful with it, and get brilliant stuff like The Writ. Too much results in Fluff. And Iommi was smart to recognise this, but Cliff Burton was not. And he continued to write songs full of this dreck. Ask Hetfield to throw on a few random metal riffs, and what you get is something claimed as \"amazing\" by all the losers that would also claim In Flames as a masterwork of a band. Of course, this anthem to loserhood has no heart whatsoever, no spirit, no emotional content. Nothing. Thunderhead, this is not. Stargazer? Fuck no. Certainly not anything out of the Diamond Head catalogue. Not Am I Evil, To the Devil His Due, or even Ishmael. Diamond Head got it right, and despite the endless stream of pointers from Lars to their general direction, Metallica did not. But of course, it is easier to derive inspiration from the half-baked. Easy to look at what did not get it right, and claim that to be the best thing ever, simply so that when you make something similar, you can pat yourself on the back and be proud. Thus, Dark Tranquillity, be proud. You sound like complete shit, and have the intensity of zero point zero Iommis, and you are hailed as an excellent modern band. Because you took the Orion approach to things. So, Dark Tranquillity, make sure to send Lars a Christmas card once a year, because you owe your entire career to him. So many bands nowadays do. So many bands would never have gotten off the ground, if \"getting off the ground\" were not so kindly redefined as \"flopping right over and accomplishing nothing\" a la Orion.\n\nThen, the last song. Damage Incorporated is the last of Hetfield's contributions to the album... fast and completely insipid. This is not, in any way, shape, or form, to be mistaken for The Burning of Sodom. This is James Hetfield's dying cry as Lars Ulrich finishes him off. In fact, if you look carefully, you can see the exact frame where his heart rips in two. Desperation breeds stupidity, and here is the final desperate act of a man driven to Jagermeister, not because of the grueling tribulations of the road, or of having one's equipment stolen, or because he had to send an ex-guitarist back to the west coast in a box on wheels. It's the final death of a man that thinks he is on top of the world, being the frontman of the most famous heavy metal band in existence... but slowly, subconsciously, realising he is not at all in control, and knowing that he's going to have to put on a smiling bullshit face for however many years, because he certainly can't QUIT the band, but the only way to stay in is to submit to Lars Ulrich, despite all of their public assurances that they are partners in crime. Hetfield is weak, and resorts to over-the-top boasting. Most thrash bands would, of course, do something like this, but somehow none of the Overkill catalogue comes off nearly this pathetic, this fake, this... incorporated. Overkill are rotten to the core in the best sense of the word... Metallica in the worst, most corporate. And at the head of this machine is the midget himself, Lars Ulrich. He holds the world in his hands... his band, his \"music\", his scene. \n\nBest not to listen, kids. If you have any decency, any individuality, any self-respect. THIS is why I gave the album a zero, because it is the album that will slowly draw you in and destroy you too. Let this be your warning.\n\n\"Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings...\"\n",
        "\nGripes about the production of the album aside, for me this is neither Metallica's best nor is it their worst. They make a good overall stab at being progressive but really once I listened more and more to this I found limitations and started to feel it wasn't as good as they'd hoped. They do have a formula that repeats itself for pretty much each song and also takes the album into murky territory during the middle. It opens excellently with \"Blackened\", escaping the trap of most of the rest of the album, no problems with songwriting or arrangement here, it spreads itself out well and shatters the senses like a good Metallica opener should. Then we get \"...And Justice For All\" which pretty much starts to display the main problems I find in the album. An excellent opening two mintues before we meet the verses, and then things slowly shift down a notch. The songs here are basically made up of a long verse/pre chorus/chorus passage, repeated at least three times held together by a lead break section in the middle. The only trouble with this is the long verses start to tire themselves out slowly each time they return. Twice before the mid section and once after, not just a chorus but the whole passage is played out again after the solos. The songs could really have been balanced out more and they wouldn't feel so monotonous. Sometimes it does work for the songs in the case of the title track, the thundering heaviness keeping it interesting. and the mid section is greatly refreshing once you reach it. Those parts really do save the songs in a way, you really feel better once the endless verses and choruses give way to something different. \"Eye Of The Beholder\" is the same, the quality of the parts that make up the song make the songwriting problems easier to forgive, excellent solos too. \"One\" is the token ballad with the same kind of structure from the previous albums, this one also gets played a lot more than the rest of the album for me as it's also a live favourite and a video too. It doesn't tire easily I have to say, it's stronger than most of the rest on here.\n\n\"The Shortest Straw\" suffers heavily from a repetitive chorus, which starts the album's decline here, the riffs are good but the song needed to be put together better. The mid section again breathes life into it and gets your attention, but the ending verses kind of kill it off again. Another live favourite \"Harvester Of Sorrow\" is a good one... again kind of spoiled in that they could have reduced the number of times we hear the verse and chorus, it's still good. \"The Frayed Ends Of Sanity\" finishes this trilogy that just suffer the most from the album's problems, maybe it's to do with my mood, but since I was so into the first part of the album, I'll put this in with the other two.\n\nThings just radically pick themselves up with \"To Live Is To Die\", I really like the way they made this one, it's just as long as the title track but there's much more to it. Love it or hate it, it's still a worthy tribute to Cliff, with a nice spoken part of his lyrics. \"Dyer's Eve\" starts off great, a good fast number to round off the album in true Metallica tradition... if only it weren't for the number of times the \"Dear Mother, Dear Father...\" verse is repeated, they must repeat that more than any other passage in the album! It's not as good as the other album closers, but it has good energy and riffs that ultimately get spoiled. I would love to give this album more , The Black Album probably has better songwriting than this but everything else is done better here, though it really did take away something from this album that it needed. It is definitely worth owning though.\n",
        "\nThis is maybe the best song from Black Album. From the beautiful spaghetti-western opening (something Jaymz is a very big fan of) to the ending notes, it's a perfect song. Also, the first verse sounds scarily like my life, so it's kind of personal too. There's nothing complicated about the guitars, the drums are just there, and, well, you can barely hear the bass, but all things combined it gets amazing. The vocals are some of the best I've heard, and one of Jaymz' very best performances. Now the solo, that's a beauty. Kirk fucked around a lot in the studio trying to nail it, and when he finally found something he liked, his bandmates hated it, and pushed him further. Eventually he wrote it like this, and it's a heartfelt and godly solo. The harmonics near the ends are also divine. Wow, could I possibly say any more good things about a song? Nope, I feel I've gotten the point across, haha. \n\n'Killing Time' is an awesome cover song (Sweet Savage did the original). The drum intro is badass, and the riffs, vocals and..everything, is made for partying. Damn, I wanna get drunk right now! Hah! Killing time!!! Man, many of Metallica's best moments are found in their cover songs, and that's kinda unique. And that doesn't mean the original material suck, either, it just means that they're the best cover band there is!\n\nLast, and least, is the demo of 'The Unforgiven'. Not much to say. It's not any good, and was included for laugh purposes only. I laughed and cringed the first time I heard it, anyway. Still, this is an almost perfect single release, and deserves an almost perfect score. Later.\n",
        "\nI like this video, just two versions of the \"One\" song, with an introduction by Lars Ulrich. It's not too expensive which is a good thing since this video is just about 20 mintues in length. The introduction is neat with Lars explaining all about the ideas behind the song and the making of the video itself. The first version of the video, is the band playing the song in a warehouse intermingled with clips from the film on which the song was based. The whole thing is very dark and affecting, and leaves an impression on you, and hammers home the messages of the song. The clips from the film really tell the story of the song with the soldier in World War I blown apart by a landmine and kept alive despite the fact he cannot speak, see, hear or move, and wants nothing but to die. Very gloomy and depressing overall really, but that's what it was meant to be! I find I like watching this video a lot despite the depressing and sad imprint it leaves on you afterwards.\n\nThe band calls the next version the \"Jamming Version\" which is basically just them playing the song in the warehouse without the film clips. The song is also shortened by a few minutes too. It's not quite as good but it isn't bad either. It was basically done as an edit in case music channels wanted a shorter version or something and the band doesn't think much of it. It's probably just on there to make the video longer and worth shelling out money for. I think this is a good video, and the introduction and end bit with Lars talking about it is cool. Go and get it if you can find it cheap! I don't know how available it is, but it shouldn't be too hard to track down, might become a collectable some day.\n",
        "\nI'm a die-hard Metallica fan, but this is weak sauce. This album is simply the worst in the catalogue, the live recording is poor, James's voice is poor, the performances occasionally lack for fire, and the orchestra tends to get in the way, like in \"Master of Puppets\" when the main chorus riff is obscured. Often it doesn't work, but when it does, man it works. This is a missed opportunity, but all is not lost.\n\nThe opener, \"The Call of Ktulu\" is by far the best track on the album, definitely deserving of the Grammy the band picked up for it. The closer to the seminal Ride the Lightning record, this song takes on a new dimension with the orchestra swirling and adding colour and definition to an already intensely symphonic track.\n\nAlas, \"Master of Puppets\" is a big step down, the strings and horns squawking and stumbling as they try to follow the frenetic riffery. James turns in a solid performance, and the song kicks, but I just wanted the orchestra to STOP. And that's no good for this type of record. \"Of Wolf and Man\" is surprisingly effective, the song loping along through the rainy drizzle, the orchestration adding subtle menace. But like a rollercoaster we then plummet into a heartless and pointless version of \"The Thing That Should Not Be\". \"Fuel\" again does not work with the orchestra, and indeed loses out to the slick and streamlined studio version. Also, James just sounds off on this cut, as he does often through the album. Same deal with the \"Memory Remains\", which is salvaged only by the crowd's enthusiastic participation.\n\nBut man, back up we go to giddy heights with \"No Leaf Clover\". Holy crap, what a great song. This song is one of those people-movers Metallica is so good at, James at his most poignant and passionate, the guitars like a force of nature. And although Kirk has somewhat lacked for inspiration, the NLC solo is a godly little piece of simplicity. And those heavenly orchestrated moments...\"Hero of the Day\" is a weak tune, but this live version blows that limp-wristed studio cut out the window. \"Devil's Dance\" is a success by keeping it simple stupid, the orchestra adding ambience rather than overwhelming the music. We close with the epic \"Bleeding Me\", a solid cut but the orchestra doesn't really add anything.\n\nDisc 2 opens with \"Nothing Else Matters\", a song that was done well enough on the Metallica (Black) record with strings that it doesn't really require inclusion here. \"Until it Sleeps\" is a godsend though, the moody dirge being a highlight of the latter-day catalogue and the orchestra only gives greater voice to James's agonized narrative. Good to see \"For Whom the Bells Toll\" present, a good performance but I'm not sure how much the orchestra adds. Still nothing wrong with it. \"-Human\" is the other original track here, and it's a brilliant Sabbatherian crusher with Het again rising above his often lukewarm performances (referring to this album only of course) to deliver one of his finest demonic performances, along the same lines as \"Devil's Dance\".\n\nLet\u2019s not talk about \"Wherever I May Roam\". It just doesn't work.\n\nBy all rights \"The Outlaw Torn\" should close the album. Nothing else here is worth your time. But man, \"Outlaw\" is just a fucking great track. Everything that was right about the huge almost western-like scale of the original is ten times better here, the band hitting all the right notes, the orchestra hitting all the right notes, the whole thing being Metalliperfection.\n\nThen they do \"Sad But True\". Good song, but boy does it ever not fit with the symphony motif. \"One\" is surprisingly lacklustre, the symphony again not adding to but smothering the intricately perfected (and sole Justice track) dirge to the point where it's just useless. Machine-gun riff and symphony orchestra are proved beyond argument to be incompatible. \"Enter Sandman\" is painfully drawn out and dull-edged, the orchestra again throttling a keyed up performance. And \"Battery\", again gallops along at a clip the orchestra can only fumble at and drag down.\n\nThis should've been one disc.\n\nThe Call of Ktulu\nOf Wolf and Man\nNo Leaf Clover\nHero of the Day\nDevil's Dance\nUntil it Sleeps\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls\n-Human\nThe Outlaw Torn\n\nAnd where is \"Fixxxer\"? \"The Unforgiven\"? \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\"? \"Orion\"? \"To Live is to Die\"? \"Eye of the Beholder\"? \u201cFade to Black\u201d? \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are\u201d? \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d?\n\nUgh, it is just frustrating.\n\nStand-Outs: \"No Leaf Clover\", \"The Outlaw Torn\", \"The Call of Ktulu\"\n",
        "\nWell, this disc is a bit of a stop gap. It's a bunch of tunes from the Load sessions and some new songs mixed together and released to capitalize on the bands considerable momentum. It's not bad or anything, nor is this exactly like Load, but in the constant evolution of the bands sound, this is a bit of a plateau.\n\nThe album isn't quite the warm state of mind Load was, a lot less heavy and perhaps a little more metallic riff-wise while still miles away from say, \u201cThrough the Never\u201d or \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d (he says, picking names out of a Metallihat). Kirk is increasingly dependant on that heavily distorted wah wah guitar solo style that he's come to rely on like a crutch. Lars is as solid and predictable as ever, and Newsted still doesn't have much to say (dude, he wrote \"Doomsday for the Deceiver\"! Give 'im a say!), and James's experimentation with other music doesn't sound so much novel as rock star-y.\n\nThe band is locked in an endless mid-tempo groove, only \"Attitude\" and \"Fuel\" stepping out of it. Some of the lyrics are rather insipid, \"Better Than You\" for example. And unlike Load, it seems a few tracks to long. So, this looks like a terrible review right?\n\nWrong. I like Reload. It's easily the worst album they'd released yet (circa-1997), but who the fuck cares? The worst Tallica record steamrolls the best release from 90% of the bands out there. Reload is a record that excels in its moments. The chunky bass intro to \"Devil's Dance\", the \"Memory Remains\" breakdown, the \"Sweet Leaf\" homage that opens \"Bad Seed\"...granted, those are some of the worst tracks on the album but it goes to show that even a bad Metallica song has moments that can just grab you and make you fuckin\u2019 glad they still make music. Err, well maybe not the guy who gave it zero, but irregardless...\n\nThe speedy tracks are a bit of a split in quality. \"Fuel\" is an adrenaline pumping near-thrasher, and probably would've been a certifiable speedster has Lars given in a thrashy beat. Alas. However, it is a very heavy song that is undeniably metallic, even if your definition of metal starts with Grand Belial's Key and extends through Nile to arrive at lighter stuff like Cryptopsy and Satyricon. It's not in that league of heavy, but it's metal quotient is just as high. James freewheel burns through it with manic intensity. Catchy solo, catchy riff, and a bah gawd back-up vocal showing from Jason, if you crank the volume and listen real hard. \"Attitude\" on the other hand is much like \"Cure\", a good riff wasted by puerile lyrics.\n\nOur ballads are damn good. \"The Unforgiven II\" is yet more Metallicountry, but it remains one of their more popular 90's tunes. Nice poetic lyrics, good delivery, and a convincing twang, plus plenty of musical references to the original and utterly classic \"The Unforgiven\" boost this track up. \"Lowman's Lyric\" is a strange, strange folk song, that features some of James's best singing and a very catchy structure. I know most of em off by heart, and I find myself humming the tune a lot. Strange. \"Where the Wild Things Are\" reminds me of the earlier Metallica dirges, a stirring Newsted penned composition that slow-boils like nobodies business before exploding into a very metal riff and powerful refrain, sung by both Newsted and a multi-tracked Hetfield. It's doubtful this kind of multipart harmony could be reproduced live, which is a shame especially because this has both Hammett's best solo on the record and Lars's most military beats.\n\n\"Prince Charming\" moves at a pretty good clip actually, James's delivery making up for the rather silly lyrics. Generic riff, but a good one nonetheless. \"Slither\" is a strange sorta \"Enter Sandman\" type vibe, same way \"King Nothing\" was on the last record, and shows us still more of Het playing around with distorted vocals, something he's been playing with since \"The Wait\" on the Garage EP. Special credit for one of my fav lyrics on the album:\n\n\"Don't look for snakes/You might find them/Don't turn your eyes to the sun/You might blind them/Haven't I seen you here before?/Have your heroes disappeared?\"\n\nI've left my two favourites to the end, both earthshaking epics in \"Fixxxer\" and \"Carpe Diem Baby\". \"Fixxxer\" is an immense construct, opening with a dissonant violin screeching away like a skipping record. Huge, loose chords slowly begin to crawl in from where they lurk off-screen and we swing into a chugging opener. Man, if they'd done this in 1988 or even 1990 imagine how tight and fucking metal it'd be. Instead, it's something just as interesting, a big loose classic, another gravity defying monster in a monstrous catalogue. The lyrics are both thematic like pre-Load Tallica and personal like that record, a two-fold piece that feels like a bridge between old and new. Unsurprisingly it's many an ex-fans favourite 90's era Metallica song. Brilliant, and one of the big absences on the S&M record.\n\n\"Carpe Diem Baby\" is one of those album tracks that just jumps out at you like a facehugger in the Alien films. More mid-tempo crunch, but James's weary yet passionate delivery and the titanic riffs save the day. And holyyyy crap what a break. If you can't tell I'm air-guitaring pitifully. The break and solo just move like a rollercoaster or an avalanche, one of those grand old Metallica moments that raise an otherwise average song to the heavens the way \"Struggle Within\"'s famous break did for that song.\n\nIn summation, another difficult album that rewards much listening, re-listening, and study.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cFixxer\u201d, \u201cCarpe Diem Baby\u201d, \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are\u201d\n",
        "\nI'm not really surprised I'm the first person to give this album a high review score, but it does annoy me when this album is derided as commercial or simple, because it isn't. Granted there were a bunch of singles from this album, but so what? This is album is anything but easy.\n\nMetallica has been making difficult records from day one (excepting the Black Album). The holy trinity of albums 1-3 had no compromise and no remorse as they steamrolled every other metal act on the planet to become the biggest underground metal act of all time. ...And Justice for All was an extremely gruelling tour de force of embryonic progressive thrash. The record hit number 7 and scored a top 40 single, but there is no one on this planet who would call it radio friendly. Load follows in this tradition in my opinion, because of its musical progression from what came before, because of it\u2019s lack of compromise. Yeah, lack of compromise if what I said.\n\nI don't mean to say it's a thrash record because it's anything but. It's mid-tempo grooves galore(grooves? the horror!) and only the opener and a few scant sections really open throttle, and not in the traditional \"Fight Fire With Fire\" fashion. But in many ways it's just as difficult as the Justice record. First of all, it's a marathon record clocking in at something like 78 minutes. And although it has a few radio ready singles (\"Hero of the Day\", \"King Nothing\", and \"Until it Sleeps\") they tend to be butted in between marathon epics and off-kilter experimentation.\n\nThe album is all about slow-burning momentum, in the same way a doom record is even if the sounds are worlds apart. It's almost overwhelming, this loose and bass-y state that slowly smothers the listener as it rolls inexorably from solid riff to riff. In the midst of this are a bunch of strange acoustic(acoustic intro's anyway) numbers, from the tombstone gloom of \"Mama Said\" to the bouncy aggression of \"Waste My Hate\", that along with \"Ain't My Bitch\" and \"Cure\" proves the album does indeed have a pulse. Also of note are the rare (on the albums anyway) flashes of humour on \"Poor Twisted Me\", a self-pitying paean to those who swim in depression (I'm looking at you Miss Rubber Suicide Razor).\n\nLoad enjoys some of the best production Metallica has had, less than the ultra-produced self-titled but thankfully more than the non-production of St. Anger and ...And Justice For All. The album is startlingly heavy, probably because Jason Newsted (and for that matter, the bass guitar) finally has an equal part in the mix.\n\nNot everything here is good of course. \"2x4\" is the worst thing the band ever wrote. Ever. It's so mind-numbingly dumb and dull. I don't think I've listened to it in at least a year. It's practically on autoskip. And \"Cure\" is a waste of a good riff, Hetfield taking poor lyrics and then making them even worse by giving out dance instructions (\"Uncross your arms...\"). What is this, the Metallicaraena? Kudos to the \"Breakin' the Law\"-ish lead break though. \"Hero of the Day\" is a little weak, perhaps the only really blatantly commercial song on the record. It's not reprehensible, but it sounds like they were aiming for a big \"We Are the Champions\"-type arena sports anthem, which in hindsight they seem to have achieved.\n\nCompare \"Hero\" to the sublime ballad \"Until it Sleeps\", featuring one of James's best performances ever, and it simply wilts. \"The Outlaw Torn\" is an epic that can stand up to the biggest classics of yesteryear and look it in the eye. The whole song has such a dramatic sweep that you feel lost in it, and the majestic \"Behind Blue Eyes\" style climax was made for the stage, eclipsed only by the live S&M version. \"Bleeding Me\" is another one of those songs that nails you to the floor, particularly the godly metallic break that underscores the metal in METALlica, something admittedly missing from this record. Finally, a mention must be made for \"Ronnie\", a booze 'n' blooze groove that features a rusty riff and sing-song melody that sticks in my mind for miles and miles and miles.\n\nThis record really is a brave step for Metallica. Compromise would be sticking to out-and-out metal if it wasn\u2019t what the band felt like playing. Through the myriad twists and turns of the catalogue, they rarely give the impression of writing for the sake of money or fame. Conventional wisdom following the success of the Black Album would be more of the same. Instead, we get this smoky, low-slung, and weighty album of earthtones and withering energy. On Reload they showed us a more alternative metal face, less about personal problems and more unconventionally jumpy songs. After that, they made a move that flew in the face of convention and released the clanging fury of St. Anger. Metallica may not be the same band they were in 1983 musically, but that spirit of integrity persists and shines through to this very day.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cThe Outlaw Torn\u201d, \u201cUntil it Sleeps\u201d, \u201cRonnie\u201d\n",
        "\nFirst off, I think it was an awesome idea to add an orchestra on top of Metallica's thrash classics and I think for the most part that it turned out very well.\n\nUnfortunately, this integration is lackluster on some songs, mainly the faster, thrashier numbers. The orchestration clearly doesn't belong on the songs of this type because it creates a huge mudpuddle of sound that drowns the listener in utter ear torture and death.\n\nOn the slow, melodic numbers, however, it works excellently. For example, on No Leaf Clover, it adds large slices of emotion to the song. It's gotta be those violins, instruments notorious for portraying deep sorrow and eliciting higher sensory responses from their listeners.\n\nOn many mid-tempo cuts from later albums such as their self-titled opus, this formula works fairly well as well. For example, the orchestration on Sad But True is pulled off surprisingly well. However, I think it's often superfluous and detracts from the overall drive of the song, which isn't good. It's like listening to a chamber orchestra warm-up for ten minutes before actually playing a piece of music.\n\nAdding orchestras to the songs already makes them more emotional, but when each song is introduced and exited by the enthusiastic crowd's screaming, it makes it so much better. I'm not much for live albums, but the band members don't talk very much in between songs, so it makes it more tolerable.\n\nAll in all, a very interesting little tangent the band has gone on here. Sure, there are other bands which would be better suited to orchestration, but Metallica is fucking epic, and an orchestra makes them even more fucking epic. Oh, another thing that bothers me about this album is that The Unforgiven Pt. I and II aren't on here. They would've been perfect for inclusion on this disc. It's really a shame. Although this isn't the ass-kicking Metallica we all know and love, it's still an interesting addition to their discography and is quite relaxing at times. Nothing will beat the originals, but it's cool to hear different takes on them.\n",
        "\nIf you look at the history of metal, there are certain records that have marked paradigm shifts within the genre. Black Sabbath (and equally, Paranoid) was metal ground zero, being metal and metal proper. Along with Purple's In Rock, metal was born. A few years later, Priest took metal to new heights, with their steely progressive/power sound. Never had metal been more technical before, and they began playing songs louder and faster. And then eight years later, Ride the Lightning.\n\nTo cop from another source, if Kill 'Em All was the manifesto, Ride the Lightning was the revolution. Thrash metal had been wobbling about for a few years (Motorhead, Anvil, Raven), but the new age of metal was predicted by Kill 'Em All. That record laid down the basic blueprints, with longer, multi-part, technically demanding song-craft that blew the simple speed metal of Anvil and Show No Mercy-era Slayer out the window. But at heart, it was still very much only a proto-type. Ride the Lightning was the electric birth of a new form, the record with more in common with the Bay Area Thrash movement known and loved today.\n\nIn short, Ride the Lightning contains all of the fully-formed elements of the greatest acts of the speed metal generation. Specifically, the songs made sense. The Kill 'Em All stuff felt like shit thrown at a wall and sort of loosely recorded. How else do you explain the intro to \"Whiplash\"? So far as I know, you don't open a metal anthem with what they open it with. No surprise it's been excised from later live shows (enough with the stalling, lets get to the thrashing alright?). In addition, Metallica beat everyone to the punch by actually taking on social issues in their music. No \"metal for life\" or \"Hail Satan\"s here. Instead we get a difficult world of teen suicide, the death penalty, nuclear war, and the horrors of battle. And the more fantastical tracks seem to mean a little more, rife with possible allegory and hidden meaning.\n\n\"Fight Fire With Fire\" is basically the quintessential thrash song. Tight, bolted down aggression that just rolled over you like a fucking panzer assault, even more shocking after the moment of peace (admittedly, lifted from the Accept playbook). Nothing on Kill 'Em All feels like THIS. This became the template for thrash, a higher level of violence that only Slayer would reach for (and lets be honest, meet with \"Hell Awaits\" and beat with Reign in Blood) until a little band called Death broke onto the scene. Well Death, and Possessed, and Kreator, and Dark Angel, and\u2026 you get the point though. It\u2019s very possible none of those bands would have gotten as dense, as ridiculously forceful as they did without FFWF, and none of them managed to do it first. Okay, I got to say it again, this song is so damn tight! This is thrash with an unshakeable foundation, the blistering tempo and serious low-end combining to become both immovable object and unstoppable force. Oh, and that growling inflectionless vocal by James would be a precursor to the trademark death vocal begun on the Seven Churches album. In fact, its very lack of melody in any way shape or form is everywhere in early death. Hell, most late death too.\n\nAnd onto the title track, another fan favourite and important piece of the metal puzzle. Just consider this from a positioning stand-point, back in 1984. First, you blow the doors off the hinges with the most insane song in the history of the world (circa '84 dammit). Then, you show \u2018em that you can also rock their socks off at a mid-tempo speed, the riff being slow but just plain powerful like something Pantera would write six years down the road. Without sacrificing the considerable FFWF momentum, Ride gives the riffs room to breathe and the vox take a place somewhat closer to, but not quite, center stage (don't fuck with the power of the guitars!). And what's this, a rocker without an aggressive vocal? Zuh? James sounds like he's about to piss himself(if you were going to the chair you fuckin' would), and his wails against the injustice of it all come off as A)realistic and B)not at all lacking in serious metal tude.\n\n\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is worshipped, and with good reason. This song is the first Metallica song that was great in a classic metal vein (save \"Seek and Destroy\", but that albums (non)production killed that chance). I mean, in 1984 you're probably busy learning the lyrics to fuckin' \"Round and Round\" and then you listen to \"Fight Fire\". Jesus! What was that? \"Ride\"? Little more accesible, but those tempo changes are still mystifying. But FWTBT, this is something we can understand. This song is metal with a capital \"M\", but this isn't quite so alien from the mainstream as the rest. The song doesn't lack for riffs either (in keeping with the album formula), particularly towards the beginning where the band just smushes a bunch of riffs together with a lead break and, a rarity, the most unearthly spidery bass solo in the world. The song chugs along, Lars playing a few fun fills, we get a bunch of leads, and most importantly the song introduces us to Metallica's new ability to convey scope and drama. You can practically feel the misery of the doomed soldiers, the song becoming coldly majestic and more purely cinematic than anything since, maybe uh, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\".\n\n\"Fade to Black\" is the next truly great dirge (ballad just isn't metal enough, ya know?) in the history of metal, following in the iron clad footsteps of \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". It's also the first/second thrash ballad, neck-and-neck with Metal Church's \"Gods of Wrath\" for that title. But \"Fade\" really has more to do with the textbook version of the form with practically everybody in the thrash world doing copies of it. And why not? Most of the copies end up being fucking amazing, just like the blue-print. Metallica proves to be just as adept with the electricity off, crafting some simply heart-breaking acoustic riffs and solos (grown men cry, dammit!) and of course when the electricity comes to the fore it's all the more earthshaking for it. I'm sorry for being so goddamn fawning here, but this is perfect. The lyrics are simple and stunningly effective, James's imperfect, broken performance complement the song like no technically perfect 5-octave ranger could. And the wordless chorus is just purely eloquent, the force and depth of the despair beyond words, but encapsulated by the sweeping guitar.\n\nAh, better collect myself. Well, \"Trapped Under Ice\" is a good song to do it with. This is dead simple as the album gets, the other half of the straight up thrash pair on the album. I've never been particularly fond of this one, but it's popular enough. No fancy tempo changes, just thrash. It's the most Kill 'Em All song on the album in fact. And the lyrics are a ball, with James either allegorically talking about isolation again, or simply spinning some NWOBHM demon wax. Very tight too.\n\nAnd now, the strangest track on the album. \"Escape\" isn't really hated by anyone, surprisingly, even though this is really not thrash. I've actually heard this described as something Skid Row might write, but it's really more in the line with Screaming-era Priest. Steely twin leads, and Priest-Priest-Priest riffery. Hell, lyrically this is totally British Steel. James is no Rob of course, but this is straight up fun metal like we thought had been left behind on Kill 'Em All.\n\nWell, when you look at the list of Metallica classics, there is one track that is never omitted. Okay, actually there are tons, but \"Creeping Death\" is one of them. Sorry for the inauspicious intro to one of the best goddamn songs ever written, but my not-so-slick wit often gets away from me. \"Creeping Death\" isn't quite the iconoclast that the first four are, as most of the innovation here is present on \"Four Horsemen\", but it's so damn good that that doesn't matter. This song moves briskly, though not shreddingly, an even tempo that is perfect for headbanging. The riff is unforgettable, the lyrics being another Metalli-epic that does the impossible: out-Maidens Maiden. This song is biblical in size, the band rising to the heavenly height of it's subject matter. This is also the most badass Christian-positive song EVER. Not that the religious right would necessarily approve of the delivery, and this is one of the gorier parts in the Good Book, but irregardless...anyway, the \"die, die, die\" section is one of the most life-affirming moments in metal, unmatched in spine-chilling might, particularly live when you have 18 000 maniacs screaming their lungs out over Burton's throbbing tribal bass line.\n\nSo, how in the world do you top \"Creeping Death\"? Well, Metallica certainly tries, and in the process brings one final innovation on an album chock full of em. The instrumental has been a piece of the metal puzzle since the beginning (Sabbath loved them), but it's never really been an important one. The best Sabbath instrumental, \"Fluff\", was pretty much what it sounds like. They were pretty much scrap, mostly used to intro or segue songs. Metallica would have none of that. \"The Call of Ktulu\" is the most important metal instrumental yet, a sky-scraping fucking MOMENT in the history of metal. After hearing \"The Call\", no metal band worth their salt failed to record an instrumental, least in the 80's. This song is just genius. You can see the monster rising from the waves(even if James can't spell it's name)and howling it's rage through Cliff Burton's mad bass squawks and the twin leads sweeping up, around, everywhere. The song progresses and retreats like a military campaign, guitars climbing and swirling in place of James's shouts, using the ascending riff formula that was such a big part of the Justice record. And it's long too, most instrumentals of the past being maybe four minutes tops.\n\nRide the Lightning is Metallica's most important record and makes a great claim for being their best. It's certainly more important than glory-hog Master of Puppets, but it's a matter of preference. For me, best Metallica record tends to be the one I happen to be listening to, so I'll make no judgement. I'm sure you own this record already, so I won't recommend you buy it. So I hope you've enjoyed my retrospective of this album, and perhaps appreciate its vast importance in the metal world.\n\nStand-Outs: Arguably the best album ever and you ask for stand-outs? \u201cCreeping Death\u201d, \u201cFade to Black\u201d, \u201cThe Call of Ktulu\u201d\n",
        "\nNow, I'm not big on live records. Most of the time they're cash-ins, and although some sound better than the studio, often they lack the inspiration and novelty of the original cut. However, this grabs a big score by being 1) Metallica, 2) Well-recorded, and 3) Fucking huge. It's insane for the individual CD set to be pushing 60$ Canadian and the DVDs around 70$ but this doesn't detract from their quality. It only limits their distribution, and thus this album is rarely considered as one of the greatest live albums ever.\n\nWell it is. By sheer breadth it's nearly unparalleled (did someone say Pearl Jam? Quiet you), and these are incredible performances from an incredible band at the height of their powers. It's also the most LIVE live album I've ever heard. The crowd is high in the mix, the stage banter is rambling and untouched, and the performances are raw and electric.\n\nActually, what is almost my fav part in this box is the stage banter. James is a comedic genius! Rarely have I ever laughed out loud at a metal record, but this one is great. I actually quote this thing daily, which is either sad or awesome depending on your perspective. Plus, one of the funniest drum solo's in history right here.\n\nAnd then there is the spontaneous feel. No other band just start dropping pieces of covers 'n' classics like Metallica, or at least with that sense of style. \"Frayed Ends of Sanity\", \"Smoke on the Water\", \"Little Wing, \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Mistreated\", \"Hall of the Mountain King\", \"Blitzkrieg\", and others make cameo appearances (mostly during solo spots) and it becomes a fun game to try to recognize the snippets. Of course you could cheat and check the liners...wanker.\n\nAnyway, video/DVD one is the Seattle show from the ...And Justice for All tour. It's the shortest set alas, but this is old school Metallica to the nine's. The performances are sublime, and say what you will about post-Master Tallica records, these guys had their live shit down like never before. Also, this was the first tour with sizeable venues, and the scope of the audience lends power and glory (*wink*) to the show. Anyway, the set is nearly impeccable (even a piece of \u201cOrion\u201d) and we get some of their greatest songs. \"Blackened\", \"Sanitarium\", \"Harvester of Sorrow\", \"Master of Puppets\" (with interlude!), \"Whiplash\", \"Breadfan\", \"Four Horsemen\", \"Am I Evil?\" (uncut version!), and best of all, \"...And Justice For All\"...fuck it, everything here rocks are unsafe levels. Oh, and the bass solo is actually entertaining if overlong.\n\nSan Diego is a marathon show from the Black Tour. The new cuts (five of em) fit in perfectly with the old school cuts. \"Enter Sandman\" is heavy and groovy, with some Lars's most inspired drumming on the intro and outro. \"Through the Never\" and \"Of Wolf and Man\" are energetic, and \"Sad but True\" is live perfection. \"The Unforgiven\" is a tune the band never plays anymore, but it's fucking incredible live, and holds it's own with no less than \"One\", \"Fade to Black\", and \"Sanitarium\" in the same set. The Justice medley is incredible and I'm so enthused that we get to hear \"Eye of the Beholder\" and the title track, two cuts sadly neglected in recent years. Alas, the guitar solo is overlong and dull, and the bass solo is only notable for a taste of the beautiful \"My Friend of Misery\".\n\nMexico is the longest show of all. Basically whatever goes for the others goes for this one. I question the need for seven black tracks, but we still have an equal number of old schoolers plus more Kill 'Em All. \"Motorbreath\"! Of special note is the \"Battery\"-medley, featuring pieces of \"No Remorse\", \"Ride the Lightning\", and \"So What?\" before galloping into the eternal set piece \"Battery\".\n\nIn other words, buy this now, forget the house payments!\n\nStand-Outs: God\u2026 Seattle \u201cAm I Evil?\u201d, Seattle \u201c\u2026And Justice for All\u201d, San Diego \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d\n",
        "\nWhile I am a fan of everything Metallica has released, I can honestly say that no album of theirs has held my interest as long as this one. I have to be in the right mood for most albums, but this one is an evergreen.\n\nMetallica has always enjoyed playing covers, and this collection is a nice salute to their long career and the bands they enjoy listening to. I would argue that Blue Oyster Cult wasn't a huge influence on the band, but I don't think that disqualifies them from being covered. They don't do Maiden and Priest because those are obvious choices. Even four covers in, most people have no idea who Diamond Head are. Same for Discharge and Mercyful Fate. And nobody would expect a Nick Cave or Bob Seger cover. About the only ones you might expect are the Motorhead covers, and those were done for a Lemmy tribute show. Metallica enjoys surprising people, and that's what they've done here.\n\nThe electric opener is \"Free Speech for the Dumb\", the first of two Discharge covers, and it thrashes along like nothing they've done since uhhh, \"Through the Never\" maybe. It's dead simple, but you can tell they're getting a kick out of it. \"It's Electric\" contains some of Diamond Heads dumbest lyrics(well, \"Sucking My Love\" is worse) but that riff is infectious, and it's fun to hear James hamming it up like a 70's hero. Oh, and I love that multi-tracked sustained note in the chorus.\n\n\"Sabbra Cadabra\" is my least favourite number here. The Sabbath original was a trippy almost honky-tonk metaller with a nice bluesy piano line and a real sense of boogie. The Metallica version strips it off this and makes it come off as a \"Load\" reject. However, major points for a truly metal grafting of \"A National Acrobat\" into the middle of the song.\n\n\"Die Die My Darling\" beats the stuffing out of the original. It's one of the more grim songs in punk history, and Metallica infuses it with coiled menace and some very impassioned vocals. \"Turn the Page\" is a nice chugging Bob Seger cover. I'm a huge fan of Bob, and this cover can't beat the originals moody atmosphere, but they certainly give it the ol' college try. A nice fuzzy Hammett solo, and the song has a great rock out section the original seemed to build up to, but never released.\n\nHere we have a truly epic cover, along the lines of \"Fixxxer\" or \"The Outlaw Torn\". The verses are all classic Cave doom and gloom, and the lyrics are perfect for James who really shreds his vocal chords on that titanic chorus. It's odd how the term \"epic\" can be put on something this personal, but it's both. James rambles like he's playing in a bar in front of twenty or thirty people, and you are almost soothed by the quiet before he goes back into that brimstone n' bells scream. \"LOVERMAN!\"\n\nThe Mercyful Fate medley is a classic speedy metal cover, and I can picture people crying with joy at it (the kind who piss on their 90's records mostly), It's got some of Fate's best early tunes, most from Melissa and the Mercyful Fate EP. It's comprised of the following: 1. \"Satan's Fall\" (a song that's actually longer than the whole medley) works well, and it's hilarious to hear Metallica doing straight up \"hail Satan\" lyrics 2. \"The Curse of the Pharaohs\" is even better than the original version. The guitars are heavier, the bass superior, and although James ain't King Diamond, this song wasn't one the King's tougher to perform anyway and doesn't suffer from the change. Also fun to hear Kirk do more than one solo in the same song for once. 3. \"A Corpse Without a Soul\" is one of the best vengeful zombie stories in metal (how many are there?), and it's a smooth segue from \"Pharaohs\" to 4. \"Into the Coven\". \"Come come/Into the Coven/and become Lucifer's Child!\" Ah, I love this part. James seems to know of what he speaks, and although the King is wailing away on this with all his might, James makes his point felt. 5. Last is \"Evil\", and I really wish we'd gotten more of this one because it's a damn good song.\n\n\"Astronomy\" is the third homer in a row, with the band ably honouring one of the Cult's most magical songs. James emotes well, and the band seems to thrum like a tightly wound string before snapping back on another titanic chorus. Gotta love those enthusiastic \"HEY!\"s over a winding medieval piece of castle rock par excellence. Then back into the verse, nice Hammett solo, and another big payoff and ride-out solo.\n\n\"Whiskey in the Jar\" was a big hit and deservedly so, but I think that they could've picked a better Lizzy tune. Nothing special here. \"Tuesday's Gone\" is an oddity in that it was recorded live for an acoustic jam, whereas the others are all new studio tracks. It's one of Skynyrd's best songs, a beautiful lonesome ballad that, like \"Turn the Page\", perfectly evokes the feeling of the road. Obviously those haters of \"Metallicountry\" won't find much to like here, but them's the breaks. Not sure why we needed seven guest musicians here, but I'm a big fan of AIC, CoC, and Primus so I won't complain that they are represented here.\n\n\"The More I See\" is another dead simple Discharge number, and a fitting close to disc one. Stay tuned for a little guitar and bass doodle bonus track thingy.\n\nDisc 2 is even better in my opinion. I reviewed the Garage Days EP earlier, so check that for my thoughts on tracks 1-5. Suffice to say, all of em are great, with \"Helpless\" and especially \"The Small Hours\" being stand-out tracks.\n\n\"Am I Evil\" is the greatest Metallica song they didn't write. Much as I love Diamond Head, Metallica blows them away on this song. This is Metallica playing straight up evil like they rarely do, and it's great. Huge epic riffs, some of James' best howls, a solid \"Paint it Black\"-like military march drum beat from Ulrich, and solos solos solos! This, along with \"The Prince\" really shows how much compositional influence these NWOBHMers had on Tallica. It thrashes it grooves and it crushes.\n\n\"Blitzkrieg\" is a fun dumb proto-thrasher from a band of the same name, but lets be honest here, the Tallica version is worlds better because they are far superior players. This is a real toe-tapper though, with a nice riff, some cool Burton bass work and just a real fun NWOBHM cheese metal feel. Also gotta love the \"fucked up in one place\" sound bite from Ulrich at the end. These two tracks were from the classic \"Creeping Death\" single originally, just as an FYI, and comprise the very first Garage Days chapter.\n\n\"Breadfan\" is another classic, a hyperspeed update of an already hyperspeed song by loveable underdogs Budgie. This was high metal science back in '73, and it still rocks like a mofo today. Gotta love the pretty interlude with what is in actuality one of Kirk's better solos. A comparable section in \"Crash Course in Brain Surgery\" was axed and replaced with hilarious drunken bellowing, but luckily it's still present here. Of course they axed it and made it even more frenetic live, but what the hell. Also features one of the more challenging lyrics in the Metallica cannon because of the speed and length of the verses. I still wanna know what the hell is up with the \"fluffy\" line at the end though.\n\n\"The Prince\" was one of the first true Bay Area Thrash songs. None of the stump-dumb structures of Anvil or Motorhead here. Dizzying speed, tons of tempo changes, and one of the most unforgettable lead breaks ever. If Diamond Head had had a singer like James Hetfield, they would've been unstoppable.\n\n\"Stone Cold Crazy\" is a faithful update and it sticks close to the roller coaster riff-and-rolling original (how could it not?) the only difference really being a slight tempo increase an a more intimidating vocalist. To be fair to Freddie though, I'd like to see James try \"Somebody to Love\" for example. \"So What?\" is a ludicrously obscene anthem from goofy punks Anti-Nowhere League. It's a fun tune, and the production is easily the best on the second disc. Even though it's from mid-career Metallica, this is one of the first modern Hetfield vocals. Keep it simple stupid.\n\nOne of the very first Metallica covers, \"Killing Time\" is somewhat unremarkable except for James' quirky drill sergeant vocals (odd counterpoint to \"Disposable Heroes\") and the quick pace. Really little to say here.\n\nNow we have the Motorheadache set. These stick right to the book, and it's fun to hear Metallica just fucking around in the studio. Watch for some massive miscues and flubs, and some really cheap production, but who cares? Just fun fun fun, and some of the 'Heads best tunes as well. Refreshing to hear a Motorhead set without \"Ace of Spades\".\n\nAnd that pretty much covers it. One of my very favouritest albums, and one that refuses to get tired for me.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Am I Evil?\", \"Astronomy\", \"The Small Hours\"\n",
        "\nAh. And now we come to another turning point. Metallica had advanced the thrash sound about as far (arguably) as they could take it. They yearned for songs that they could play live (unlike say \"Dyers Eve\"), and wanted to experiment with new sounds. And lets be honest, the lure of mainstream success probably had something to do with it.\n\nBut there's nothing wrong with being radio friendly is there? Metallica is still heavier than anything else on the radio at the time (excepting early Soundgarden and, perhaps, Alice in Chains), and though it is not a thrash record, there are some solid thrashers on here. \"Through the Never\" has a strange futuristic (futureal?) vibe and Newsted makes his bass chug and squawk in ways that would make Burton proud. \"The Struggle Within\" has an excellent lead break, and the clanky riff and fairly numerous tempo changes (plus the lyrics) would make this a good cut on the ...And Justice record, although this one has, yes I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm serious, bass guitar. And I defy you to beat the pure metal heft of the \"Holier Than Thou\" intro. Sadly it's one of the few times where James's lyrics actually pull the song down.\n\nThe ballads are hardly sell outs, especially since they've had them since day two. \"The Unforgiven\" is like an inverted \"Fade to Black\" with its heavy verse and soft chorus, and lyrically it feels like an overview of the ballads of the past. All of Metallica's ballads have been dark, first because they had no light songs, and second because they had to make up for being melodic by making the songs the antithesis of say, \"Photograph\". This song deals with the same themes as the others, but where the others all rage at the injustice of it all, \"The Unforgiven\" is written by a tired man, one beaten down by the rigours of the world. Some beautiful vocals on the chorus, and it's hard to beat that titanic Hammett solo. Pity this rarely gets played live. \"Nothing Else Matters\" is the future, the first Metallica ballad, nay, first Metallica SONG that feels joyous and happy to be alive. And it's hard to call it a sell-out when it feels a lot like \"One\" with the dark bits excised. \n\nOh, and there are some very hard rockers floating around, some of which are even singles from the record. \"Sad but True\", admittedly a rewrite of \"Harvester of Sorrow\"(if you could write that thing, you'd use it again!) is a brutal song, a riff you could pull teeth with while Newsted proves himself to be a solid bassist. No slight could ever be made to Cliff Burton, but you almost have to think that James and Lars always wanted a bassist like this, i.e one who shut up and played rhythm. Note Kirk's oddly bluesy solo amidst the wreckage. \"Enter Sandman\" was played to death, but it's still got a nice dreamy vibe with a riff that screams for vengeance and a solo that rocks the house. \"Wherever I May Roam\" is a nice Eastern-flavoured dirge and there's no hint of blues at all. That riff is a solid chunk of metal. \"Don't Tread on Me\" has a military stomp, sorta feels like a hard power metal song. Also this song has some intricate layering that has a (Motor) breath of the earlier mid-tempo Tallica tunes.\n\nAnd the odd man out here is \"My Friend of Misery\", Newsted's baby. It was originally designed to be the central riff of the fifth Metallica instrumental, and I think with this beautiful and elegant bass line it would've been worthy of the others. Still, it's probably my second favourite song on the album, with a nice whisper-shout vocal, some nice steely leads and through it all, like some epiphany after the cold alien production of Justice and the claustrophobic layering of the other three, a wonderful warm bass line. If nothing else, thank Bob Rock for that.\n\nHistorically, this one is probably the most important Metallica record since Ride the Lightning. That record started thrash proper, and this one pretty much ended it. A few acts kept the flame alive (Heathen, Overkill), but it was the end of thrash metal's flirtation with mainstream success. And since most of the people against this record cry foul at it's success, they ought to be happy the music went back underground where they could be 'unique' in holding it to their bosoms. How did it end thrash? Well, where Metallica goes, others follow. Megadeth went from the seminal Rust in Peace to the more streamlined (albeit great) Countdown to Extinction. Anthrax was thankful I'll bet, because they were seriously running out of stuff to do after Killer B's, and they switched to a more alt-metal sound ASAP. Hell, even Slayer moved away from sonic excess to the more groove oriented (and crushingly heavy of course) Seasons in the Abyss. Thus, with the big four moving on, most of the second tier acts became lost. Upsetting? Hell yeah. But the Black Album is simply a result of Metallica's progressive nature, and under the 12 million pancakes sold and controversies inherent to it, you'll find a great album.\n\nAll that praise I level with as much honesty as the day I first purchased this album, but since then I find that the record has simply worn on me worse than any other Metallica album. It isn't that the thing is overplayed, because I dig the big pop hits when they come on the dial. The problem is that, as a whole, the album simply isn't as conceptually interesting or as flatly godly as the works bookending it. The record is an endless grey, and this album as Metallica's most direct play towards the mainstream sacrifices true three-dimensional art in favour of the more obvious and anthemic, tracks slaved to blunt riffs played without the feeling of the even simpler Load record. I find that the tracks that still have face, the ones with melancholy and pain are those that resonate most strongly and continue to give me joy even as I lay flowers at the grave of what these giants once were. Oh and \"Sandman\", because kiddies, that is one piece of perfect songcraft.\n\nStand-Outs: \"My Friend of Misery\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Enter Sandman\"\n",
        "\nWell, after the tragic death of Cliff Burton the band decided to soldier on. However, an attempt to bite the bullet and go into the studio quickly was a total failure, with only a formative version of \"Blackened\" being developed. And so, they decided to return to the old B-Side stand-by: covers.\n\nThe song opens with, predictably, a Diamond Head tune. \"Helpless\" in the original form from that bands \"Lightning to the Nations\" LP was one of the most Metallica-ish tracks on the album, combining a fast pace with the bands trademark complex structures. Metallica just shreds this one, putting the formidable pace of the original to shame, and blessedly replacing Harris's bleating (one of his most irritating vocals) with the balls out Hetfield bark. The band is top-notch, with a nice warm bass tone that really makes one wonder why they felt the need to practically omit him in the \"Justice\" sessions. The band lops of the strange galloping ending of the original tune also. I'm ambivalent because although Diamond Head did it well I don't know if it would suit Metallica's style. A nice Hammett solo or two to boot.\n\n\"The Small Hours\" is probably one of the top four or five covers the band ever did (ooh, interesting list that'd be!). I believe this song was originally by Holocaust, a fairly popular NWOBHM band, and it certainly feels like it. Creepy, nightmarish intro (like an evil nursery rhyme!) followed by a riff that just floors it. Newsted and Ulrich just bash and propel this foggy little ditty along, with some nice heavy guitar work from the axemen. And I love that chorus. This sort of feels like Motorhead with better production.\n\nNow we follow with the strangest cover on the album. Killing Joke is one of the best underground bands of all time, a seminal post-punk act and a huge influence on the Industrial scene. Oh, and much of the time they were as dark and heavy as any metal act. Tallica remains true to this spirit, with a sludgy guitar tone and heavily distorted vocals from Het. The lyrics are thus rendered practically unintelligible, but if you read the lyrics, you'll see this is dark dark subject matter, spiritual kin to the \"Justice\" songs perhaps. Oh, and the chorus is one of the most epic in the catalogue, a roar that just rises up into the sky, and of course soon falls back into the crushing riffery soon after. Another odd solo from Kirk.\n\n\"Crash Course in Brain Surgery\" is a cut from Budgie, a seminal early metal act(heavy, and heavy early. We're talking 1970 here) with a genius for naming songs in such a way that they could make Frank Zappa proud. The song itself is a jumbling freight train of a tune, hopping around crazily with a sort of proto-thrash hop. The lyrics are off-kilter and James performs accordingly.\n\nLast up a pair of Misfits tunes, one being boppy Beach Boys-on-acid tune \"Last Caress\", the other a brutal punk-metal composition going by the name \"Green Hell\". While the Misfits version was slower and actually somewhat threatening, the Tallica version makes it sound like killing babies is a jolly old time. \"Green Hell\" is just nuts. James is as close to death vocals as he ever got, a genuinely chilling caveman growl over another vicious tune. We follow with a hilariously out of tune \"Run to the Hills\" fade-out and the EP is done.\n\nSome interesting notes on this one: This EP was a big seller upon release, and the \"Garage Inc.\" compilation it was included in is probably the biggest selling covers album ever. The title of this one(the $5.98 EP) was to prevent retailers from upping the price and screwing the kids over, proving once more that Tallica is/was(depends who you ask) one of the most fan-friendly acts ever.\n\nAll and all, a great but not terribly important piece of the Tallica discography.\n\nStand-Outs: On a five track EP... \"The Small Hours\", \"Helpless\", \"The Wait\"\n",
        "\nMetallica returns, minus seminal bassist Cliff Burton, to shake the metal world once more. They've added Jason Newsted, though you wouldn't know if from listening to the album and they've gone as far as they could technically. This is the cold new frontier of thrash, Metallica creating or defining (depends who you ask) the new niche to be called Progressive Thrash.\n\nThe songs are longer, the music tougher, the lyrics more poetic, and the band uncompromising. Although I disagree, it's easy to see why people felt so betrayed by Metallica's musical shift in the 90's. This album is a mechanical paradigm shift after two similar (but equally important) mid 80's efforts. It still loosely follows the same structure, but these songs are so advanced from the familiar speed of the classic thrash era that one is almost disoriented by it.\n\n\"Blackened\" is structurally like \"Battery\" from an album back, but the cold production makes it feel totally new, and that vocal melody is unforgettable. A nice moshpit worthy breakdown, and a brilliant Hammett solo. The riff recalls Slayer circa Hell Awaits, the same aggression, the same choppy chops executed throughout, simply cold steel played with an unpredictable and slightly mechanical edge.\n\nAnd then we come to my absolute favourite Metallica song, the apex of their progressive thrash album. It's nearly ten minutes of sheer brilliance, trumping \"Master of Puppets\" in the tempo changes department and trumping everything save maybe \"Fight Fire\", \"Dyers Eve\", and \"Disposable Heroes\" in pure metal intensity. From the acoustic opening that rises dramatically to shattering crescendo before plunging down to a lone bass drum solo, to the buzz-sawing riff that precedes the chorus to the...this could take a while. Anyway, it features some of James's most politically conscious and highly effective tirades, this time aiming at the justice (duh) system. Kirk breaks out his best \"Breaking the Law\"-alike solo, a simple but effective reprisal of the main riff that sticks in your mind. And then we start to wind down, fading into the black...but WAIT! That unstoppable drum drags back that headbanging riff and we're back into it for one last go. I am a sucker for drama, and the way this song jerks you around and draws you in is like no other band. Perfect, grand, Metallica.\n\n\"Eye of the Beholder\" is one of the more simple songs on the album, and thus it became a single. Oddly reminds me of \"Leper Messiah\", probably because it's a very similar tirade. Some call this number tossed off, but I beg to differ. It's one of the underrated Metalli-classics, the \"Disposable Heroes\" of this record.\n\nAh. And now we come to the most controversial song on the album. Some call it the best thing Metallica wrote. The others call it derivative and unworthy of the legacy of \"Fade\" and \"Welcome Home\". They are wrong. The acoustic solos at the outset are nearly (although they are a little too noodly) a match for \"Fade\", and the lyrics are even better. How disturbing is that idea anyway? Unable to move, simply drawing in breath after breath in anguish, completely lacking the ability to speak and even the option of death taken away\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Imagine it, or better yet just listen to the song. James conveys it pretty damn well. Then we get the machine gun riff, the quintessential thrash riff. James barks out a pair of \"black as night\" choruses before making an impassioned scream for help along the lines of the \"Master\" fade out. This is chilling stuff, a harrowing tale of anguish handled with a maturity and skill that puts a whole genre called black metal to shame.\n\nAnd how does one follow \"One\"? If you're most bands, with filler. If you're Metallica, you release a devastating napalm thrasher that would give most good players fits. James writes a real tongue-twister lyric, then proceeds to bark it out over a tricky riff with some nice melodic bits. It almost feels too loaded up, and the absence of bass it palpable, but all is forgiven when James becomes perhaps the first musician to ever use the word \"nadir\" in a song.\n\n\"Harvester of Sorrow\" is probably the best live song in the bands repetoire, right up there with \"Creeping Death\". It's a dead simple core, with some solid proggy window dressing and a stomping drum beat that really makes one want to rock their way into a neckbrace. Some of James's best lyrics (I keep saying that don't I?) here. \"Look deep into my eyes/You'll see where murder lies\". How fucking metal is that?\n\nWell, this is the weakest track on the album, but that still makes it better than 90% of the stuff out there. I love the rumbly intro, and the solo is nice. The opening is a little bland, but the middle sections are nice head-bangers. \"Frayed Ends of Sanity\" is fatally uneven, almost like \"Hanger 18\" (not as good though) in that it's a very bland, mid-level thrash song that masks a god-like breakdown, one of Metallica's most technically demanding (and therefore rarely played) musical sections. It contains a lot of unconventional stuff, from the total Megadeth-y twin lead to the jolting staccato chunk metal that just builds up and up and lifts off.\n\nAh, the grandiose instrumental piece. It doesn't disappoint. \"To Live is to Die\" is sort of the logical apex of the prog-thrash experiment, with numerous tempo changes, interesting approaches, and even a very arty little Burton quote read oh so metally by James. Some soothing bits, some skull-crushing bits, another great Metallica instrumental, and also the longest track committed to record. Be sure the complexity and length of this one rubbed off on the next wave of proggers and thrashers. It features such alien beauty, Metallica playing sombre riffs with an aching sense of sorrow not found anywhere else save for perhaps \"Fade to Black\". It's also oddly Floydian, except amped up x10000 and without the dressy production.\n\nAnd now we finish with the biggest piece of shrieking aggression Metallica ever wrote. This thing could kick a nice hole in a Slayer record or three, and the drumming is so crazy Lars can't even do it live... not that that really says all that much mind you. James breaks out the cussing once more for dramatic effect, and lyrically it's the most simplistic lyrics present. Doesn't detract from its awe-inspiring headbanging might.\n\nIncredible, unparalleled stuff, and although you might hear different, the streak would continue onto the next record.\n\nStand-Out Tracks: \"...And Justice For All\", \"Harvester of Sorrow\", \"One\"\n",
        "\nMaster of Puppets is one of the greatest albums ever made, and that big 100% up there is all about the quality of the album. Master is certainly important, but most everything here is on Ride the Lightning. Where RTL\u2019s genius is inevitably mixed into my visceral feelings towards the materials, Master is more coloured and shaped by the tremendous regard so many people have for it. For millions of metal heads, this album is it.\n\n\"Battery\" gives us a nice \"Fight Fire With Fire\" flashback, and it's really a toss up as to which is more skull-crushing. \"Battery\" has the advantage of better production though. Anyway, everybody is on their game here. A lot of shredders are kind of same-y, but the \"Battery\" solo is unforgettable, and the vocal performance on \"Battery\" is amongst James's most unhinged yet, and would remain so through song after song until perhaps \"All Within My Hands\" from St. Anger, a song that isn\u2019t anywhere near this level of quality anyway..\n\nNext comes the perennial candidate for greatest metal song ever, usually in a dead heat with \"Paranoid\", we have \"Master of Puppets\". This song is just iconic. When you hear the name of this song, you don't ask who did it. You just know. Some of James's most poetic lyrics being barked out over one of their greatest riffs, with performances that could scarce be bettered by any level of technical insanity that would come along since it\u2019s release. A plethora of amazing solos, one by Hetfield, the others by Hammett, the lead axeman giving us some of his best (great \"Fade to Black\"-alike and the shredder to end all shredders). This song is like a modern \"Four Horsemen\", grasping those unwieldy tempo changes of \"Kill 'Em All\" and beating them into shape, forging their (occasionally charming) unpredictability into a cold, logical forge. Metallica made great multi-part epics palatable and sensible, a deed that metallers world-wide should be eternally grateful for. Also worth noting, in head to head battle with the similarly structured \"Ride the Lightning\" album, most matches are draws. But in the title track war, it's a blow out.\n\n\"The Thing That Should Not Be\" is a mean bruiser that lumbers about for 6 minutes and miraculously refrains from collapsing in on itself. Hetfield returns to his Lovecraftian interests on this one, with an eerie, eerie vocal performance (esp. live where you can see a certain wildness and paranoia in his eyes) that claws at your head like one of ol' H.P's stories. Brilliant and strange solo from Kirk, and crushing basslines from the immortal Cliff.\n\n\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" matches \"Fade to Black\" in beauty, and manages to trump it in 'rawkage', with a true thrash section that feels even heavier because of the massive build-up. The song also features another fucking amazing performance by Hetfield. \"The mirror stands back on/natives getting restless now/mutiny in the air/got some death to do\". I stand in awe of this man. Bow down. Also a very smart move by the band to make this melodic number stand out more by separating it from the \"Master\" interlude with the heavier-than-thou \"Thing\" and following it with the most brutal thrash-fest on the album.\n\n\"Disposable Heroes\" is often left out in discussions of classic Metallica song, which is a damn shame. This is Lars Ulrich's absolute best performance, propelling that stacatto riff and rhythmic snarl for a good 8 minutes. Another strange (and beautiful) lead break near the opening of this one, before we get to the lyrics. This song is like a panzer assault. It just rolls right the fuck over you, and after listening to this one it all blends together into one big sonic punch in the teeth. And I always feel like taking it again, the only standard that really matters when one comes to plumbing the depths of extreme metal.\n\nAfter \"Disposable Heroes\", the righteously heavy \"Leper Messiah\" always feels like a respite. I'm not sure if they started the trend (and I really doubt it), but Metallica certainly put their stamp on the now classic \"rant-at-bad-preachers\" concept (\"Holy Smoke\", \"In the Name of God\", \"Miracle Man\"). Another pounding Ulrich performance, and one of the tougher vocal melodies on the album(took me some time to get that chorus down). A shorter number, and an oddly dissonant one, but it's just as classic as the rest, despite rumours that Mustaine wrote it. It\u2019s not very Dave-like anyway.\n\n\"Orion\". As if you don't know it already, Metallica can write beautiful music (\"Four Horsemen\" interlude, \"Fade to Black\", \"Master\" interlude, \"Sanitarium\"). But this one is so pure and spaced out that it's practically heart-wrenching. It's fun to listen to this in the black and think of the cosmos as Burton shines through for once, his warped Thin Lizzy-ish solo's elevating this instrumental to new levels. Also look for another fine Hetfield solo, and Kirk Hammet's best homage to his former teacher Joe Satriani. Oh, and the uptempo bit rocks pretty nicely too. It\u2019s gotta be said that Metallica is key in bringing the classic prog sound back into metal, the psychedelic fringing that would give birth to acts like Voivod and Amorphis, one of the Black Sabbath traits that few bands had dared to co-opt into their own sound.\n\nAnd last, but not least, Metallica's \"Kill 'Em All\" throwback \"Damage Inc.\". Elsewhere we've seen insightful lyrics and beautiful streamlined music...well, that stopped one song back buddy. After the beautiful Burton intro (damn those icy roads!), Metallica goes shred crazy, James vomiting forth propaganda like a good Metal Militiaman. Gotta love that whispered chorus amongst the sonic chaos, the hushed and frantic quality of it simply adding to the high-tension wire freak-out feel of this apocalyptic closer.. The whole band is operating at 11, with James's most forceful performance yet and some dizzying tempo's(plus, Lars is going so fast it even tired out Mike Portnoy performing it live!). Harkens back to a simpler time really, and an interesting way to close an album full of drama and scale, keeping the fans happy with the uber-thrash that brought them into the building.\n\nThe third home run in a streak of 5 total classics in a row, something only perhaps Black Sabbath was able to match.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d, \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d, \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d\n",
        "\n\"Kill 'Em All\" is generally called the first thrash metal record, and while I would argue that it isn't(Motorhead, Raven, and Venom were doing speed earlier), it's damned important, and the next one would tie up all the disparate elements and give us the first true thrash record. But I'm reviewing \"Kill 'Em All\" and it deserves our attention.\n\nThis album used to scare the crap out of me because it had so many tempo changes. People call Metallica's music simple today, and compared to say Dream Theater it is, but in 1983 NOBODY wrote like this. From the punky opener \"Hit the Lights\", to the rambling, rumbling, and ripping \"Four Horsemen\"(the interlude, the galloping end section...this is proto-\"Master of Puppets\"!), to the insane bass work out, it became apparent Metallica was not just your everyday band. Look at Motorhead or even Accept and you'll see that they wrote fast, but simple. Metallica took Diamond Head's complex structures and kicked it in the ass with Motorhead velocity and created metal magic at a higher level. Slayer's \"Show No Mercy\", often bandied about as \"Kill 'Em All\"'s equal in innovation had NOTHING on this album, and it wasn't until \"Haunting the Chapel\" and bah gawd \"Hell Awaits\" that they'd hit their stride.\n\n\"Seek and Destroy\", despite it's derivative riff(\"Dead Reckoning\" anyone?) was proof positive Metallica could write commercial music, though rock radio would never play anything with production this tinny, and \"Whiplash\", well \"Whiplash\" was arguably the precursor to the more bolted down aggression to come. Oh, and did I mention it rocked at dangerous levels?\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d, \u201cWhiplash\u201d, \u201cNo Remose\u201d\n",
        "\nA big 'meh' is what I give this album. Metallica's fourth full-length album, and the last in the line of their legendary albums- the time when they were not sellouts (although they did a music video for One despite claiming a few years earlier that they'd never make one). And this is no MTV bullshit, this is extremely metal, it's just also extremely boring for the most part.\n\nThe average song length on \"...And Justice For All\" I'd guess is around 7 minutes, and with only two out of nine songs below six minutes length, this album just feels overlong and nearly all the songs seem unnecessarily extended. The thing is, having long songs is in itself not a bad idea, but what we have here is mostly 5 or 6 minute songs extended with forgettable middle sections and dumb repetition of both vocal lines and overtechnical riffs. \"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\", the title track and \"The Shortest Straw\" among others all fall into the category, and so does of course the instrumental \"To Live Is To Die\", which is even more boring than \"The Call of Ktulu\". Way more boring.\n\nThere are still a few good songs that keep it from being a complete waste. The opening track \"Blackened\" features some nice semi-melodic and occasionally strangely timed speed/thrash metal riffwork and catchy vocals, and doesn't really get overlong despite reaching a length of 6:40. Easily the highlight of the album. \"One\" of course ain't bad either, but it's bloody overrated. The mellow first couple of minutes are pretty damn lame. The \"hold my breath as I wish for death\" part sounds promising, but they never do anything with it. When this dreary crap ends and the song gets going we get some kickass material however- the double bass driven thrashy bridge is very cool.\n\nAnd then there is one more really good song on here, and that is the closer \"Dyer's Eve\". Some of the riffs make it sound like a follow-up to \"Damage, Inc\", but the intensity and quality is nowhere near that classic. This still has some nice thrashing moments, the main riff especially is very fun. The kinda melodic bridge - \"Innocence torn from me without your shelter\" - is very solid too.\n\nBut the other songs just fall into the category 'mediocre'. Most songs have their fun moments - the title track is kinda catchy all over, but way too fucking long. \"Eye of the Beholder\" has very memorable verses, but boring music all through. Also, \"The Frayed Ends Of Sanity\" has some really fun backing vocals and riffs during the opening. But after a while, all of this stuff gets really boring.\n\nAnother reason for why the album is such a disappointment after the three classics \"Kill 'Em All\", \"Ride The Lightning\" and \"Master of Puppets\", is of course the production. Barely any audible bass at all if you don't listen very, very closely, and the drum sound is thin and worthless. Better than that of \"St. Anger\", but still worthless. And on the drumming, Lars continues to suck, on this release managing to be schizophrenic and repetitive at the same time.\n\nEventually, this album does little to nothing for me aside for a few good moments here and there. Metallica should've disbanded when Cliff died, cause after his departure their music sucked.\n",
        "\nOkay, I don't know what the hell possessed them to release this, but it does't rock very hard at all. Oh, Jump In The Fire is decent, if not a little commercial, but it has some good riffs and a somewhat memorable chorus. It's no Seek & Destroy, but it's still a nice song. No, there's something else afoot here.\n\nThat something comes in the form of \"live\" Seek & Destroy and Phantom Lord. You see, these songs aren't actually live. They were recorded in a studio with fake crowd noise added to the mix. This normally wouldn't lose the CD so many points, but it's so obvious that it's fake. For one thing, I've ehard Metallica bootlegs from 1983, and they did not sound this refined. They even played sloppily at times, especially during the Ron McGovney days. The sound is also too polished to be live. Also, the crowd noise is too loud. By that I mean there seem to be too many \"people\" in the \"audience\", like it was a big festival or something. Why couldn't they just record an actual live version of the songs and save everyone the trouble? It just doesn't make sense! Such obvious falsity and deception costs this single quite a bit.\n\nOn a side note, why the hell does the production sound worse than it does on Kill 'Em All? It sounds almost demo-like. Metallica completely lost their heads on this one.\n",
        "\nThis DVD basically tells the story of how Metallica's classic \"The Black Album\" was created. The main focus is how each of the 5 singles from the album (Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Holier Than Thou and Wherever I May Roam) were conceived, along with Nothing Else Matters. Along with the typical interviews (some of which are funny as hell, especially the ones with Lars), demo versions of some of the riffs/songs are showcased, such as the original riff from Enter Sandman (which isin't nearly as good) and a really nice harmony over the chorus of Sad But True. They also show a version of Nothing Else Matters with an orchestra, curtosy of Michael Kamen (who later worked with them on the decent S&M). It is very interesting to see the attitudes of the band while they were recording, as they were usually very pissed off the whole time. There is also a special features section which showcases a few more interviews, as well as the original version of \"My Friend of Misery\" and an explaintion for \"The God that Failed\". Finally, included is a very pointless discography. A very good buy.\n\n\"Then Bob came up to us and said \"I've heard you live, and I just don't think that the sound on your albums really captures your live show\", and we were like...Excuse me?? Who the fuck are you??\" - Lars Ulrich\n",
        "\nSince I've been getting more and more into metal, certain rock songs and hard rock in general has become more bland to me than it used to, and it just doesn't get my juices flowing . \n\nIt also has to do with the sheer amount of times I have heard certain songs on the radio, and this song from the MI:2 soundtrack is one of those. I've heard it so many damned times that it's lost its hard-rocking appeal and serves only to clog my eardrums. \n\nThis isn't necessarily a bad rock song, but it's not a good metal song either. If it is metal, it's metal in one of its most commercialized forms. I\n\nt begins with guitars that sound like sirens and corrresponding drum fills that give way to a nonchalant, thick groove. This song wouldn't be too out of place on the Black album or one of the earlier Metallica releases. It has enough aggression and melody to stand out, but is evident of Metallica's transition to Selloutica, which had actually already begun somewhat with Load. \n\nFortunately, this song is much too good to be on Load, and maybe even Reload. Load is 'country' for crying out loud, right?\n\nHetfield's vocals aren't as sharp as they used to be, but that's to be unexpected. Plus, he's doing a different style of music now. Thrash requires harsher, more forceful vocals anyway, unless you're Dave Mustaine.\n\nThe climactic guitar 'solo' is very wicked and will get you moving if you're feeling ancy. It irks me that many metalheads seem to think it taboo to 'headbang' or move to metal/hard rock. Somehow they justify it as making them seem less intellectual, and though is it true in some ways, I also see the need for us as human beings to give into our primal instincts and feelings. \n\nI just don't see how this song initially wouldn't make you want to get up out of your seat. It's not a prodigy of a song, but it's still damn good. The way I see it, Metallica fans should be rejoicing that this song isn't a rehash of anything from Load. \n\nUnfortunately, this song is put on the next abomination of an album, St.Anger. Poor thing, it's much too good to be put on that album. I haven't even heard the album, but from what I've heard from the self-titled single and the reviews I've read of it, it's sure to be pretty bad. So sad.\n",
        "\nOkay, so this is, as many seem to note, the definitive Metallica demo. By this time, most of Kill 'Em All was in Metallica's setlist (actually, all of it was, except the bass solo), and so this contains seven out of ten songs from the album. Now, the sound quality on this demo is absolute crap, it's even worse than Megadeth's Last Rites demo. But, the guitars are very audible, and that's all that matters.\n\nIt is something to note that the lineup was very different from the Metallica of today. We have Dave Mustaine on guitars, and he is a bit better than Hammett, and definitely a better songwriter. On bass is Ron McGovney of Phantasm. There's nothing really spectacular about what he does, but he's decent nonetheless. Also, James' vocals are very different. He sounds just like a 16-year-old boy on here, and his style seems to reflect that of Diamond Head rather than...whoever his other ones reflect.\n\nThe music is exactly the same as on Kill 'Em All, with a few minor differences. The Mechanix (later to be renamed The Four Horsemen) is missing the middle section and it has different lyrics. It is interesting to note that this version of The Mechanix is slower than the version that appeared on Megadeth's Last Rites demo, and is longer, yet this version was recorded before the one on Last Rites. Perhaps Lars (he wouldn't become Lar$ until later) was holding him back. Anyway, this pretty much sounds the same as Kill 'Em All, except for the differences I just told you about. The reason I like this better than Kill 'Em All is because the performances on here are just so fucking RAW, and they contain mroe energy than on the full-length.\n\nIf you can find this demo, and you might, it is pretty common on eBay or places like that, you should definitely get it. It is a tad more enjoyable than Kill 'Em All and the somewhat skippable songs (Whiplash, Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth), and No Remorse) are gone, aloowing more thrasing continuity.\n",
        "\nI bought this vinyl from a friend for 10 dollars (Canadian), not telling him how hard it is it find. Well, I certainly ripped him off! This, to me, is Metallica at their absolute peak, with the sole exception of Cliff missing in action. There are 5 cover songs, each is very well executed. The production is not that bad, considering it was recorded in a garage, and I think that hearing the guys cheering/swearing after the song is done is cool and adds to the atmosphere. Helpless has some great riffs and Hetfield's voice is in top form. A great beat to be found not only on this song, but the rest of the album as well. The Small Hours has a really cool high intro part, then into more riffs. This song is not as fast as the rest, but is still great. (Flips vinyl over) - the other 3 songs are (almost) just as good. The Wait reminds me a bit of Helpless, which is definitely a good thing, as it has the same idea of cool riffs and a great beat. Crash Course in Brain Surgery has the most headbangable beat on the album, with a nice bass intro and some pretty well done vocals by James. The last song, Last Caress/Green Hell is probably the only low point for me, as I am not a fan of punk music and this song does not really fit in with the rest of the album at all.\n\nGreat album!!! Buy it if you can find it!!\n",
        "\nKill 'Em All marks the start for one of the most well-known thrash metal acts of all time. A band which I don't think I have to introduce, since you're here already, anyway. As I was saying, what we have here is a prime cut of pure thrash from a former giant, and it is good.\n\nHit The Lights...PURE FUCKING THRASH, just like everything else on the album! This cuts out all the bullshit and comes straight for you right off the bat with nothing but thrash, thrash, thrash, from start to finish! The riffs are distorted, monstrous, unholy beasts, Hammett's leads are very nice (though perhaps a tad overrated) and the bass looms over it all, offering a lovely backing for the shredding in the foreground.\n\nHighlights: Everything! Well, maybe not EVERYTHING. I love Cliff and everything, but the bass solo is pretty suck. So is Phantom Lord, thoughit isn't bad enough to skip. Everything else, though, is mighty metal all the way through.\n\nYou are not a metalhead if you don't own this. I'm not even kidding. This is one of the finest offerings from a once great band, and a metal classic through and through.\n",
        "\nPersonally, despite what others say, I really enjoy this song. While it doesn't exactly compare with Metallica's early work, it is still a great song in its own right. It begins with a really fucking cool beat with the drums, kinda like a machine gun. I do wish that this lasted longer, because it really is the highlight of the song. The little clean solo thing is nice, because it's kinda the calm before the storm, so to speak. After this, the heavy part comes in and kicks ass before the verse, which has a pretty straight-forward message. The tick-tick-tick-tock thing is really stupid, but that's about the only real fault on the song. The machine gun drums return once more, during the middle and basically the same parts are repeated over. The last minute of the song presents us with a really cool riff, until it comes to an abrupt, heavy ending. \n\nThis is my 2nd favourite song off the sub-par St.Anger, after \"The Unnamed Feeling\". The production does really lick balls and James is starting to lose it on vocals but still a good song nonetheless. 85 times better than the 1st single, \"St.Anger\".\n",
        "\nThis was Metallica's first recording without the very missed Cliff Burton. Metallica wanted to show to the world that they still had it, and that newcomer Jason Curtis Newsted actually was a great bassist. The EP got a warm reception , and is now a vital piece in the history of Metallica. All five songs are covers, and mostly good ones too. \n\nThe first song is Helpless, originally recorded by Diamond Head. Metallica have over the years recorded FOUR Diamond Head songs, and this is, as with the others, a cool cover indeed. Both the riffing and the drumming are frantic, and overall a very aggressive song. A bit too long, though, perhaps. Next up is The Small Hours. This is maybe the best cover song on the EP, and a fucking blast to play on the guitar! It begins calm, and builds up eventually. The main riff is a real chugga chugga one, and cool. A few minutes later the song speeds up seriously. And the fast riff found is so badass it's hard not to bang your head into whatever (or whoever!) is standing next to you. Total fucking ownage. \n\nThe Wait is the worst of the covers. It's a good one, but nothing about it stands out. A somewhat boring vocal delivery (because of the stupid vocal lines, of course. Hetfield can't be blamed on this one), and sub-standard riffs. The chorus simply repeats \"The waaaaaaiiiiiiit! The waaaaiiiiiiiit!\" all the time, making it possibly the most worthless chorus of all time. Still, I don't mind hearing the song once in a while. It IS Metallica, after all. Crash Course in Brain Surgery is a funny song. It sounds like the band was drunk when they recorded it, with all the shouting and yelling in a couple of places. The lyrics are fun too, so it fits very nice. It's midpaced, with a memorable main riff, and good vocals. \n\nThe last song(s) is Last Caress/Green Hell, two songs thrown into one. The Last Caress-part is superb. \"I've got something to say! I killed your baby today!\" Nice lyrics indeed, hehe. The riff is supercool, and in usual Metalli-style, damn memorable (well, so this isn't their riff, but so what!?). Then the Green Hell-part kicks in, and it's a blast as well. It's fast, attitude-filled and punkish (not strange since The Misfits wrote the song). Ending the track is a piss-take on Run to the Hills by Iron Maiden. Ulrich always played the intro to Run to the Hills on rehearsals, and in the end Metallica decided to record a short, out of key version at the end of the EP. A cool detail.\n\nIt's damn hard finding a copy of this EP nowadays, but luckily it is included on the massive Garage Inc. double album. Buy that one, since it full of other great cover songs as well.\n",
        "\nWe have three songs here... Raze basically gave the factual breakdown, and we've probably all heard them before, so there isn't much left for me to say. Other than the fact that Creeping Death is a very good song from Metallica's best LP... Am I Evil is an excellent masterpiece of power metal... Blitzkrieg is frantic (tick tick tock?) and energetic and almost as good as the original. Hetfield's vocals are a new take on the song, as opposed to those of Brian Ross. Both work great.\n\nHow the fuck Kirk pulled off the Am I Evil solo is beyond me (there's a REASON they only play half of it live!), but it is almost as good as the original, and that is saying a lot, because the original is basically the best NWOBHM song ever.\n\nThe two B-sides appeared on some pressings of Kill 'em All for a few years - why they took them off is beyond me, because they fit well in the context of the first two Metallica LPs. Now they're available on Garage Days for Crack Money or whatever the fuck their latest compilation is called. But you'd rather get the original EP, because they don't make it no more, so if you buy it used, you're not supporting the corporate hierarchy.\n\nEither get this, or the Kill 'em All with extra tracks... whatever the fuck you can find.\n",
        "\n\"I'M CREEPING DEATH!!!\" This song is simply godly! \"DIE! YOU MOTHERFUCKER!\" And the live versions with Jason Newsted are also godly. But, hey, this is the original studio version, taken from the equally godly Ride the Lighting album. There are some pretty badass riffs to be found, and the chant part in the middle is the ultimate sing-along (or should I say shout-along?) moment in the history of Metallica. Overall, Creeping Death is just perfect. \n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough, the b-sides are almost as good. The first one, Am I Evil?, is the best cover song I've ever heard. It totally slays Diamond Head's original. Every time I hear it, I just have to headbang. The main riff is one of the coolest I've played on my guitar, and the rest of the thrashy song is just...you know, this almost brings a tear to my eye. Not to forget; the Hammett solo is total ownage not found anywhere else, and some of the best he's ever done. Enough with the superlatives, eh? The final song is another cover, called Blitzkrieg, originally made by Blitzkrieg(!). A damn fine song, with a seriously shredding main riff, and overall reeking of coolness. \n\nMan, I just gotta give this a perfect score, it's simply a perfect single.\n",
        "\nNow why did they choose Jump in the Fire as a single? It sure wasn't because it's the best song on Kill'em All. But I guess the masses needed something not too aggressive to consume. Actually the song is very good, with a couple of damn catchy riffs, and a memorable chorus. \"So come on! Jump in the fire!\" etc. It's probably the song on Kill'em All that is closest to what had gone before. The b-sides are pretty cool, too. It's two fake live songs, Seek & Destroy and Phantom Lord. I have no clue why they would add crowd noise to the recordings. It's just stupid. They were recorded live in the studio, but noone else was there. Ha. As one-off live in the studio, though, they are actually VERY good. You can hear the bass for once (you just can't with any of the Metallica albums), and the bass lines are damn good. Cliff certainly was a brilliant musician. Too damn bad he's gone. \n\nBy the way, these three tracks are also found on the Jump in the Fire/Creeping Death EP, possibly the best EP ever.\n",
        "\nYes Adam, you were being a little generous with the points as this album manages to suck as much ball as an industrial sized vacuum. Frantic was the worst song off the St Anger album and how a something manages to that is beyond my comprehension. I\u2019ve only heard the song a few times, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to comment specifically on the individual parts of the song so I will only say: it sucks. That\u2019s all you really need to know. It\u2019s amazing what shoddy production, no talent and watered down ideas can create. \n\nOh, and the cover art sucks too. Just like with the album, Metallica use the same art for freaking everything. I\u2019ve seen this image four times on new Metallica merchandise already and wouldn\u2019t put it past them to do it another four times. The thing that bothers me about this image the most, however, is that it is missing two gigantic testicles in that big mouth. Green, angry angels; Crappy band logos; sucky \u2018music\u2019. The whole sad case just blows. It is laughable however; people still buy this shit, even though fucking a dead goat carcass would be more pleasurable, and I am sad to say, I am one of them. Fuck I hate myself\u2026.. ARGH!!!\n",
        "\nI know there is pretty much no hope for Metallica anymore. Frantic has probably one of the worst choruses I've ever heard. \"Fran tic tic tic tic tic tic tock\", seriously I don't know how these guys thought this was a good idea. The lyrics besides the chorus aren't as horrible, but still don't lie on a continuum that even hardcore Metallica freaks can enjoy. The little distorted riff isn't all that bad, but there is no expansion on it as it is played over and over again throughout the whole song, which gets really annoying. I am being a little generous with the points, because at least on this single, it doesn't sound like Lars is beating on garbage cans nearly as much, but still the drumming lacks variety. I know that the St. Anger album has been bad-mouthed enough already, so I'll just leave it at that. If Metallica weren't so proud of this song, making a video for it, playing it on the mtv music awards, and on their mtv icon, then maybe they could pull their heads out of their asses and come up with something better, but until they do, I had advise against buying anything they'll put out for awhile.\n",
        "\nThis song is probably little more than a weak Load track which didn't make the cut. In other words: it sucks. Jaymz' cheesy redneck vocals are probably the best part about this song as they actually really add to the the Southern Boogie Rock atmosphere. The main riff however is just dumb. We're seriously looking at Nickelback material here. As for the lead guitar? More shitty wah-wah crap from Guitar God Kirk Hammet. You won't even notice the drums. Seriously. They're there but...they're not. The bass is standard Nickelback thumping with no real purpose or direction. And lyrics are some of the worst ever written. \"Hey, hey hey! Here we go now!\". What the fuck is that!? Well despite these flaws, keep in mind that it could and did get worse with the follow up to Load. As the title suggests, this song blows but its a hell of a lot better than St. Anger. If you don't already know, avoid this shit. When it plays on the radio, turn it off and spin the new Maiden. With that said and done, I'm out of here like Shitallica's credibility.\n",
        "\nThe title says it all: This is fuel, one of the best songs on Reload, i know this isnt saying much, as it isnt a fantastic song. \n\nThe live songs are decently done, although they could have picked better songs to do other than 'Sad But True' and 'Nothing Else Matters'. Something like Creeping Death or something from Kill 'em All to compliment the speed (?) of fuel. But then again, i guess they didn't want to blow Fuel out of this world!\n\nThis, like most singles are only collectors items, so i guess if you are a die hard metallica fan, you should include this in your collection. Other wise, there is really nothing new to offer. You've heard fuel before, and you have probably heard these tracks live as well...\n",
        "\nWell you all know what metallica sounds like with the orchestra - alright. but yeah, nothing particularly special, although it was unique. well, the three tracks on this single are pulled straight from the album and therefore sound EXACTLY the same. You won't find anything new as far as the music is concerned. The three tracks are 'No Leaf Clover' 'One' and 'Enter Sandman'.\n\nHowever, what makes the single the least bit special is because of the multimedia items. A four part documentary informing you how this project was put together. It has many little interviews with the four members, including Michael Caman. I really like James' Harley! \n\nyeah, anyway, Lar$ comes off as a pompious little shit as always. I think that he sees himself as some philosopher as hes always talking to the roof rafters, but alas, he is not. (the little fuck - i hate him)\n\nanyhow, if you can find it, it is a cool addition to your metallica collection even though i dont pull it out at all. (kind of a dust collecter)\n\nI have the Limited Addition Australian gold disk, although i do wonder how 'limited' it actually is....\n",
        "\nThe setlist is just fine. The orchestra could never have worked with the thrashiest of the thrash songs. It just wasn't going to happen. It seems that certain people need to get over the fact that thrash is not the only kind of metal in the world. The Loads are no different than any Maiden or Motorhead album stylistically.\n\nLars' drumming is just fine. He's a pretty good drummer, if an asshole personally. The guitarists are just fine, rhythm and lead. The bass isn't there because the guys hated Jason, so they mistreated him in every way shape and form, and that includes on their recorded outings. Get a live bootleg if you want to hear good bass.\n\nSome of the older songs become a bit cluttered with orchestral arrangements, but not all.\n\nHigh points: Ktulu is godlike...Master brings tears to my eyes...The Thing should've been recorded this way in the first place, as should Hero, Dance, and Bleeding Me...Nothing Else Matters practically WAS recorded this way, and it's easy to see why...some very good parts to Bellz...-Human was obviously meant for this, so it works very well...Roam, Torn, and One all fit in very well to the orchestral setting.\n\nLow points: Fuel and Memory didn't work at all...Clover deserves to be its own song, it sounds better without the symphony anyway...Enter Sandman should never be played live, the intro never sounds right...Battery is the completely wrong song to play with a symphony. Like I said, thrashy songs don't fit with an orchestra.\n",
        "\nEven back when Maiden and Metallica was pretty much all that I listened to, and I thought \u201dMaster Of Puppets\u201d was the best song ever, I found this album to be strictly mediocre. It\u2019s got killer guitar work, I must admit. Fast, furious and fucking thrashy. Thank you Dave Mustaine. And Lars sounds better than on many other Metallica albums, not that that\u2019s saying all that much. Cliff has got a boring as fuck bass solo on Kill\u2019em All, but is otherwise quite hard to hear. James sounds like shit most of the time, and that is really the main flaw of Kill\u2019em All.\n\nJames was never the greatest singer, that\u2019s for sure, but he sure does sound a billion times better on RtL and MoP. On top of that, the lyrics are pretty fucking stupid most of the time.\n\nHIT THE LIGHTS!!!\nHIT THE LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHTS!!!\nHIT THE LIGHTS!!!\n\nShut up James, please. Unfortunately, the only track this happens on is the boring as fuck before mentioned bass solo. No interesting instrumentals to at least give a break from James\u2019 crappy wailing. Luckily, the solos on here are all great, definitely some of the best Metallica ever had. Thank you Dave Mustaine.\n\n\u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d and \u201cSeek And The Destroy\u201d are the best songs on here. On Four Horsemen James actually sounds descent. And Seek And Destroy is nicely catchy. The other songs are somewhat worth listening to, if only for the magnificent leads. Again, thank you Dave Mustaine.\n\nIf you very much like Metallica, and it seems that most metalheads do, this album is probably worth buying. Thank you Dave Mustaine. As long as you don\u2019t go and expect classics such as \u201cFade To Black\u201d. Even if you actually like James vocals (or can at least tolerate them more than me), this album does get somewhat repetitive at times. Oh yeah, and thank you Dave Mustaine, for saving this album from being total shit.\n",
        "\nI bought this the day it came out. I thought it was going to be the best fucking thing ever released. Was I wrong? Of course! (Then again, I was 14). The songs are widely variated, and that is the problem. The orchestra sounds great in parts of songs. Parts. Never in a whole song (except Nothing Else Matters) does the orchestra actually compliment the music the whole way through. \n\nFor example, the two sound great together in the intro to \"The Call of Ktulu\", but horrid for the rest of the song. The orchestra sounds like SHIT when used with distortion. Same goes for Master of Puppets. With the exception of the middle acoustic part, in which it sounds very good, the two clash and sound like simply noise. The orchestra does sound better during the Load and Re-Load songs, since they are slow and more melodic, but those songs are basically 100% shit anyway, so (as UltraBoris said), nothing they do can make those songs good. For Whom the Bell Tolls sounds like utter shit. Rather then go through all of them one by one, here they are, ones that work, and ones that don't.\n\nSmash - The Call of Ktulu (some), Bleeding Me, No Leaf Clover, Nothing Else Matters, One, Enter Sandman, The Outlaw Torn, The Memory Remains, The Thing that Should Not Be, Hero of the Day\n\nTrash - Master of Puppets, Of Wolf and Man, Fuel, Devil's Dance, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Battery, Wherever I May Roam, -Human, Sad But True\n\nIf it were a decent price, I would say get it, but in Canada where a regular Metallica CD is around $22-24, this album is about $38-40. Save your money.\n",
        "\nThis showcases Metallica as the band that they once were, not what they have become. They achieve this through combining the perfect mix of old songs, new songs and stage antics in this DVD. The older songs are done very well (although they only play half of Master of Puppets and flow it into the not-nearly-as-good Enter Sandman. Am I Evil? doesn' t have the crushing intro that makes it what it really is, which really takes away from the rest of the song. The Bass/Guitar doodle is great, with My Friend of Misery being one of my favourite bass lines and Sanitarium being one of my favourite guitar riffs. Try to ignore the 4 songs from Load. The other songs overshadow them anyways. Fade to Black has a great outro and Creeping Death is done very well. They also take For Whom the Bell Tolls from Ride the Lightning, which is IMO Metallica's best work. They also do a few covers (Last Caress, Am I Evil?, So What). The Kill/Ride medley is great, too bad they couldn't have replaced the Load songs with full versions of these. Oh well, you can't always get what you want.\n\nThis DVD would be an 80. HOWEVER. I give it a 91 because of the ending. After Enter Sandman, the whole place turns dark and some guy just bursts into flames and James says \"What the fuck!!?!?!\" and the whole fucking stage collapses. After the mayhem is over, a few single lightbulbs are turned on (GREAT ATMOSPHERE) and they kick into Am I Evil? and Motorbreath. Great DVD. Expensive though....\n",
        "\nSo I now beg the question...why release the WORST METALLICA SONG EVER (after I Disappear) as a single? Why???\n\nThe song itself is simply awful. Terrible. Any negative adjective that you can think of describes this song. The premis is simple. A simple ballad from a band that has written many great ballads in their existance (Fade to Black, To Live is to Die, Sanitarium) fails in every aspect of the word. Rather than a power ballad like the others, we are \"treated\" to a country styled slow melodic ballad with James' self absorbed whiny lyrics. And guess what? Not only do you have to sit through this song, but there is TWO verisons of it on a 4 song single!! Wretched.\n\nKing Nothing follows. A live version, done fairly well. King Nothing is a pretty bad song as it is. A catchy bass riff, but other than that it pretty much sounds like something that Megadeth should have put on Risk (Which is why it fits so well with the rest of Load!). Avoid this one too.\n\nIf it was just Mama Said and King Nothing, this single would get maybe a 5. Maybe. However, Metallica throws in Whiplash, a thrashy old song from Kill 'Em All which is done surprisingly well live. A great song from Metallica's glory days. However, it isin't enough to make this single worth buying. Avoid. \n\nMama Said - 0/10\nKing Nothing (live) - 1/10\nWhiplash (live) - 8/10\nMama Said (Edit) - 0/10\n",
        "\nHaving never seen Metallica live before, I figured this DVD would be a good place to get a glimpse of the experience. This concert takes place at Fort Worth, Texas in May of 1997. Yes, this means that a good amount of the band's then-current material would be included in the set list, but they added enough classics to please fans of any era. \n\nThe opening number, their cover of \"So What\" starts things off with a bang. \"Creeping Death\" follows, and kicks major ass. The next few tunes come from the band's 90s stint, but when performed live, they outclass the recorded versions. \"One\", a concert staple to this day, is performed nearly flawless, with an early version of \"Fuel\" following. \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Until it Sleeps\" slow things down quite a bit, but no matter, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" picks up the pace soon after. \n\nBefore I go over any other songs, I would like to point something out. The band's performance of the actual songs is great, but their behavior in between songs is pretty idiotic. James is always ranting about how \"Metallica loves you man!\" and \"It's time to fuck shit up!\". It gets annoying sometimes. And they're always switching guitars during the breaks. Come on guys; let's act professional here. \n\nOkay, where were we? Ah yes, \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"Fade to Black\" are next, and performed quite nicely. A medley of songs from Kill Em All and Ride the Lightning is also included. I suppose this is okay, but it made more sense when they did that for songs from AJFA, since they were much longer. Oh well.\n\nThe second disk concludes the affair, with a cover of \"Last Caress\", an incomplete version of \"Master of Puppets\", \"Enter Sandman\", a cover of \"Am I Evil?\" and \"Motorbreath\". Overall, a good set list, but the gimmicks are very half-assed. They could have done without the flaming stuntman running around, or the stage structure collapsing. \n\nExtra Features include interviews with fans, interviews with the band and interviews with the stage crew and technicians. Maybe a few music videos or something would have been nice, but I'd say I got my money's worth.\n",
        "\nThis dvd tells the story of how the infamous Black Album was made. There's not a lot new here, save for a few stories. Basically, it just goes over how the singles of the album were recorded, and how they were written, etc. Basically, if you've seen Part One of A Year and a Half in the Life of... you know most of the story on the making of.\n\nThe only new thing here is in the extra features. This showcases James and Lars talking about the pre-porduction of the album, how they recorded the demos and where, etc. We get to hear some parts of those demos. We also hear the alternate version of Nothing Else Matters titled \"the elevator version\". We also hear some backstory on how they rushed to finish the album, and how Bob Rock knew he should work with Metallica.\n\nIf you've seen past Metallica documentaries, in particular, A Year and a Half...then there is no need to view this DVD.\n",
        "\nWe've all heard the story thousands of times. Cliff died in a tragic accident, and supposedly, Metallica's heart went with him. \n\nHowever, I don't necessarily think that's the case. Metallica still showed some great potential with this 1988 release, in my opinion. They could have easily pursued this direction with their music into the 90's, but as we all know, the atrocious Black Album forced an uneasy sense of \"what the hell happened\"? onto Metallica fans everywhere. What happened between the release of this album and the period prior to their infamous 1991 release will surely be a topic of discussion for years to come...\n\nAnyway, onto the subject at hand. \"...And Justice for All\" succeeded in pushing the progressive elements of Metallica's sound to the forefront, while still maintaining their thrashier sound from the first three albums. This isn't your father's Metallica, however. Gone are the cliched metal lyrics of \"Kill em All\", and in their stead are contemplative pieces that succeed in revealing aspects of the band that were previously unknown to their audience. \"Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is done\"? Well, what do we have here? Political commentary, or something more? I have no idea. \n\nBut what I do know, is that Metallica's playing sounds tighter than ever, albeit not as invigorating as \"Ride the Lightning\" or \"Master of Puppets\". Especially since Jason Newsted's bass is barely audible throughout the entire ordeal. What the hell? I pay very close attention to certain aspects of music, and bass is definitely one of them. This probably pissed me off more than the incredibly useless addition of the third track on the album \"Eye of the Beholder\". Filler I tell you!! Don't fret, however, since the infamous hit song \"One\" follows soon after. \"One\" is the type of song that takes time to build up, and then completely blows the listener away at the end. Not too shabby.\n\nAs for the rest of the album, \"Harvester of Sorrow\", the Cliff tribute \"To Live is to Die\", and the relentless \"Dyers Eve\" stand out as incredible numbers. All in all, this album is well worth your time and effort, especially if you're willing to work your way back through the band's discography. Metal fans are decidedly split when it comes to liking this album, but just ignore the hype and take a listen for yourself.\n",
        "\nThis CD is not as terrible as everyone says it is. The reason that so many people find it completly awful is that some look at this and say \"Metallica?? Oh it must be a metal CD!\", then they pick it up and are completly disappointed with is because it is hard rock. This, my friends, is called evolution. Some may not like it (such as me), and some may. I personally prefer their old days (Long live Puppets) and would love to see them return back to them (St.Anger was a start).\n\nThis album has it's good points, and it's bad points, like any other.\n\nGood Points: Fuel is an excellent song with a nice chord progression and cool lyrics, The Memory Remains follows in the same steps and is just slower. Devil's Dance is great, with a funky bass line and sounds less like Metallica than they ever have. Low Man's Lyric, although it really gets bashed, I think is a cool song with an excellent chorus. The Unforgiven II, although not even close to it's predecessor, is still a pretty good song.\n\nBad Points: Fixxxer is pretty raunch, I don't think much of Attitude, Carpe Diem Baby or Bad Seed. Stay away from those tracks, they are mainly just filler junk on the album.\n\nOverall, I know that I may be blasted for this review, but I think that Metallica didn't get worse at this point, they just took a step in a different direction.\n",
        "\nTo listen to Metallica before they sold out is a true experience, you received music that had meaning, purpose, and life really. The band has long been a gateway into the world of metal and for this reason I purchased this album, purchased it with expectations of them covering songs with quality work. Metallica alas did not meet these expectations. \n\nA 2-disc set of Covers Garage Inc. offers the listener songs that reside on the fringe of Metallica\u2019s normal scope of music. Sadly this venture into new territory, or should I say attempt to honour the bands which influenced them was a horrid miscalculation. \n\nThe bands/artists that Metallica chose to cover for this album were; Diamond Head, Black Sabbath, Bob Seger, The Misfits, Nick Cave and the Bad Seed, Mercyful Fate, Blue Oyster Cult, Thin Lizzy, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Discharge, Holocaust, Killing, Joke, Budgie, Blitzkrieg, Queen, Anti Nowhere League, Sweet Savage and Motorhead.\n\nLooking through the bands/artists above one can only wonder why or how Metallica could possibly think of covering songs by them! The mere thought of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Metallica functioning on the same wavelength sickens me. I mean for the love of god, if you are going to cover a song\u2026 DO IT FUCKING RIGHT! Not only does Tuesday\u2019s Gone have nothing to do with metal, but the instrumentals and vocals WERE TERRIBLE.\n\nThe first CD offers semi-quality music with adequate vocals and instrumental work, though Lars Ulrich sounds incredibly lazy on certain songs. Over all this CD was a let down, rather unimaginative and no Metallica added to the works whatsoever. \n\nThe second CD offered a new level of craptacular work from this once decent band. Though Lars seems to have recovered some energy for these songs, the overall feel of the instrumental work on this CD left me searching for a Punk CD, BLECH!!!!\n\nThis is an all in all terrible effort by Metallica to leech more money than ever out of listeners out there. The cost was outrageous for what is delivered and leaves me as a buyer wanting a hell of a lot more for my $34 CND which is probably about 25 USD or so, either way it\u2019s a waste of money that could have stayed hidden in your couch. A suggestion to prospective buyers, download this album first and listen to what you were about to waste your money on\u2026 if you still wanna buy it, go ahead. But I warned you.\n",
        "\nIt's been six years since Metallica's last studio release of original material, the substandard Reload. Okay, so Reload wasn't that bad, but it was certainly the weakest Metallica album to date. Thankfully, it still is. While this will certainly be one of the most hotly debated releases of the year, it is my opinion that Metallica returns to us in awesome fashion. Intense, weird, and perhaps slightly demented, St. Anger will rock you unforgivingly as long as you realize that it will not sound like a traditional Metallica album.\n\nThe sound on the album is very raw and unpolished. The guitar tones are big and fuzzy, even grainy at times. The bass sound really rumbles the place (kudos to Bob Rock). The drums are very hollow, though still punchy. Many have complained about the hollow snare sound, though I've never really had much of a problem with it. It is different, but I think it fits. And though there are some very nice studio touches, the album mostly contains a very live feel. I'll go as far as to say that Metallica hasn't sounded this live since Kill 'Em All. \n\nNow, on to the songs. Not a bad one on the record, really. There are weaker tracks, but they are all listenable, and more importantly, all rockin'. Take, for instance, \"Some Kind of Monster\", which contains a riffs that are so huge and groove so hard it's almost scary. \"Dirty Window\" is all over the place and features an absolutely brilliant percussive chorus. \"My World\" probably contains the most rockin' section on the entire record. Heads will certainly bang. \"Shoot Me Again\" is the closest thing to nu-metal on the album, but if it is nu, it's nu done right. \"Sweet Amber\" gives us a beautiful bluesy thrash riff. I mean, do I really need to go on any longer?\n\nThe performances are good all around. In addition to littering this album with all these awesome riffs, Hetfield also delivers a great vocal performance. He does it all here, singing at times, screaming at others, and the infamous growl finds it's way on here a few times as well. Lars delivers some pummeling drum work, including some pretty fuckin' fast double bass work at times. Bob Rock is a very adequate bass player, and while I don't think I'd want him to be a permanent replacement, he fills the void here very well. Then there's Hammett. There are no guitar solos on this album, which is slightly disappointing. He does to a good job of adding texture to the album, however. This is in no way a one guitar affair, for there are often two completely different rhythm parts going on at the same time. Repeated listens allow for peeling back of the layers, and you see that these songs really are well thought out and well crafted.\n\nI'm not going to say much about the lyrics. There are a few misfires, but for the most part they're quality. Still, they aren't your traditional 'tallica themes. Everything seems a bit more witty, there's some wordplay going on in places as well. This probably has something to do with the fact that lyrics were written by the whole band instead of just Hetfield. And that's really what we're getting here with St. Anger, a group effort. This gives the album a feel that is different from previous efforts, keeping everything fresh.\n\nI'm going to have to pick \"Some Kind of Monster\" as my highlight of the album. It just does so much for me with is balls out riffage and interesting arrangement. One especially cool thing that runs through the entire album is the bands use of odd time signatures. Great to see them treading those waters again. In the end though, it's all gold. I really want to rate this higher, but part of me wants to wait and see how often I'm still listening to it a few months from now. So, I'm going to grade down a bit, and we'll see what happens in the future.\n",
        "\nI wanna start out this review by saying this album is DEFINITELY not for everyone, and whilst there are tiny nods to the past (mostly in the drumming and the fact James' voice sounds more like the Black Album than the country twang on Load) this is not And Justice For All part 2 or anything of the sorts. It's something very new, perhaps the heaviness and rough production are similar to Justice but the groove is more Loadish or Corrosion of Conformity-like. \n\nThe beginning track Frantic is somewhat misleading. The guitar tone is quite thin, its relatively fast all the way through and its a very energetic song. However, it seems the energy in the studio isn't as easy to capture as it is live, the version from the Fillmore show does definitely sound better. The song after it, St Anger, is quite a different song. It's definitely the ideal choice for a radio single despite Lars' speedy drumming in places, its probably another good song to hear live but in the studio it's nothing to get wet over. However...\n\nThe third track, Some Kind Of Monster, is where this album REALLY kicks off. Huge chunky guitar riffs, mostly midpaced, a distinct COC and BLS styled groove and a massive \"wall of sound\" which just simply chugs along. This is probably the 3rd best song on the album, it's a brilliant song. The ending \"industrial\" sounding chant with processed vocals of \"Ominous hide in us\" just adds to the massive atmosphere. The weird ending to the song is somewhat unnecessary, but this song thumps along at a midpace and is definitely a fine track. Next is easily the weakest track on the album. Dirty Window. The main riff sounds something similar to Into the Void by Black Sabbath, but the drums are just way too bouncy and it's just generally too \"upbeat\". The clean \"I'm judge and I'm jury\" part sounds good, the main riff is good, but theres parts that just aren't like the \"I drink from the cup of denial\" part. It's heavy no doubt, but it's just not very good, the snare is mixed WAY too high. Personally I quite like the \"pasta pot\" snare, it dosn't bother me one bit, APART from in this song. After that another one of the weaker tracks, Invisible Kid kicks in. A low heavy riff that plods along, the baritone guitars get a work out in this one, where as usually it seems the guitars are tuned to a C. It's not a bad song, it's just got nothing that makes it jump out.\n\nFrom here on though, it's plain sailing. My World roars through at a fast and groovy pace and is very much like the Black Albums faster moments. A brilliant song really, and the thrash out burst while Het literally yells \"I don't even know what the question is!\" is exploding with energy. Indeed Het does sound a fair bit more pissed off on this album than the Loads and it comes out pretty well for the most point. Shoot Me Again follows on. On the first listen I really didn't like this song, but the AIC meets Nickelback styled verse works surprisingly well and the chorus is incredibly catchy, not one of the highlights but it's still a solid track. Sweet Amber follows on with a very bluesy styled riff, it has a definitely Kyuss influence, as infact alot of the album seems to. Up next is my personal second favourite track on the album, The Unnamed Feeling. It basically just plods along, with some very good vocal effects on the \"Been here before\" line...which really does add an awesome touch to it. Basically this song has a plodding verse, a clean chorus that can be likened to No Leaf Clover and a faster part towards the end which sounds like an industrial band covering \"One\". \n\nUp next is a total shocker, Purify. EASILY the best song on the album, it's just an absolute gem. It reminds me of Blind-era COC for the most part, it's just a (relatively) fast heavy metal song, incredibly catchy and very heavy. Great stuff. The ending song, All Within My Hands is somewhat similar to Outlaw Torn in the atmospheric sense in the length sense, and the thrash outburst during the \"Love is control...\" is brilliant.\n\nBasically, the band are VERY capable of playing fast music, however on here they favour a more heavier \"wall of sound\" approach, which will NOT rest well with alot of metal heads. It does have a stoner influence in places too. The production is very rough, it does sound \"garage rockish\" in the production aspect. It dosn't bother me at all, but if you're a production-freak then it's gonna piss you off more than Justice did. Lars' snare is incredibly tight, and like I said it dosn't annoy me aside from in Dirty Window, but it's definitely gonna annoy some other people. There aren't any guitar solos, there are a couple of \"guitar leads\" of sorts but there not really worthy of being called a guitar lead giving that they're basically just riffs on the higher strings, but they do create a very stoner sound.\n\nI love this album, and think it's the best this year. Others obviously will hate this. There's no denying it's a METAL album. Not a thrash album, it's just a plodding heavy metal album, and it is indeed a very heavy album. There are \"nu\" influences but they are relatively sparse, the verse in Shoot Me Again sounds quite nu, the intro riff to Invisible Kid does etc, but it's no way a \"mallcore\" album and it's never overbearing. But by that token it's NOT an \"old\" sound, it's definitely a contemporary sludgy metal album, so don't be expecting lots of flying melodies or solos cause you'll be sorely disappointed. But overall, I thouroughly enjoy this album, more so than the Black Album anyway.\n",
        "\nOh my fucking god, we've got a new Worst Album Ever. I thought that the single could just be an aberration, but ya know what, the whole thing is just as fucking bad. I mean Angel Rat is shit, and The Haunted is shit, but at least they have the decency to motherfucking STOP after a while. This thing just goes on and on... it's longer than Suckwater Park, and suckier. Oh the agony - my blood is bleeding, it's that bad after a while. I would rather amputate my own penis with a rusty tuna can lid and die of gangrene in my groin than endure this album ever again.\n\nBad parts? Everything! Awful songwriting and shitty production... very low guitar mix, and the drums are far too loud in the mix... and it's just clonk, clonk... Lars pretty much is beating garbage cans - that's what it sounds like. A very hollow, echoey sound, and it just doesn't sound fucking metal, especially not so damn loud in the mix. Sorry kids, but this is mallcore. Seriously, this drum sound WILL get on your nerves after 20 minutes.\n\nThe other really dumb thing is that the songs are fucking too long - somewhere in here there is a merely awful 30 minute album. Somewhere. But there is too much repetition - it's like they play the album twice. Also, most of this album is complete fucking mallcore - pretty much every song has some. And of course Hetfield's vocals lack all aggression... \n\nFrantic - ya know what, the Frantick tick tick tick tock part is actually bearable. I thought so anyway. The parts that really suck are of course that dumb bass riff, and the stupid \"keep searching, this search goes on\" dumb part. But that is by far the highlight of the album, and the rest of it is just complete shit - especially that dumb bass riff, and the stupid guitar tone, and of course the whiney core interval.\n\nSt Anger - we've heard it all before, and we don't care. Almost the worst song on the album... but close.\n\nSome Kind of Monster... okay intro riff except for those blasted full stops. Also the guitar tone is shit, did I mention? Also, those damn clangy drums. Dear fucking god, this whole album is just BONK BONK BONK BONK BONK BONK... also James has his least inspired vocal performance ever. He's ... talking. Also, Are we the people... that part is completely worthless, and the main chorus sounds like Machine Head gone even more wrong. The song is just too overlong for its own good. \"This is the club that drains these eyes.\" Oh yes, the lyrics don't make much sense either. Also, the riffs really are not all that catchy... they sound very generic and done without any flair and distinction - it's as if you wrote a simple computer program to listen to Slipknot and come up with something that kinda sounded similar, and do that for about 8 minutes. That's this \"song\".\n\nDirty Window - Hey, it's fast, but it's still mediocre and shitty, and they pause every once in a while (I slam my gavel down) and then there's the shitcore interval to make us all turn into sexual perverts, if we survive the experience in the first place. You know those experiments in the 1950s where they strapped a guy into a centrifuge to see how many G's he can take? This is like that... how much complete fucking torture can you take? Damn it, just cut off my balls, burn me at the stake, and get it over with. Klonk klonk.\n\nInvisible Kid - so I'm not quite sure how to describe what sucks about the intro riff, other than the fact that the tone is weak and the drums are klonky and then the whole thing sounds mistimed and stop-go-ish ... I'm not sure. All I know is, it would be good if it didn't suck so much. Oh and then the vocals come in, and the song is generally pretty mediocre... ya know, it wouldn't be that bad of a song if they turned the guitars on, oh and they didn't throw in the whiney stupid middle part and they didn't play the song pretty much twice, and this is EIGHT AND A HALF MINUTES LONG??? Make it the fuck stop. Dude. Enough. I mean it's not horrible, but it is pretty mediocre, and you really fucking wear it out when you play it for so long. \"What a good boy you are\" and we're still only 5 minutes in... dear shitting lord puking all over a minefield, make it motherfucking stop.\n\nMy World... ya know I didn't notice that this song had started and the previous had ended, until that badly coreish chorus... \"it's my world it's my world\", but then... what's this? Yes, at around 0:59, the FIRST LAST AND ONLY REAL HEAVY FUCKING METAL RIFF ON THIS ENTIRE ALBUM. For one second, then a lot more groove shit. And the guitars still sound weak and squishy and the drums are klonk klonk and make that fuckfucker just goddamn stop. Eliminate the vermin. And the aggression-nonaggression combo is terrible. \"Look out motherfuckers here I come!!\" la la happy riff. Damn it, make up your mind. Are you gonna raging thrash, or are you gonna play happy Mary had a Little Lamb riffs? \"Only do I not know the answer\" \"I don't even know what the question is\". Look, even Slipknot knows the fucking the answer. \"God it feels like it only rains...\" damn it, it only gets worse.\n\nShoot Me Again... fucking mallcore. \"I won't go away, right here I stay\"... hello, Linkin Park, we are your tour mates and we ripped you off. Fucking weak-ass pussy riffs and stupid vocals and this is the worst song on here. Come again, stop you fucking cock. This is agony. I hereby declare this song to be the worst creation that mankind has ever come up with.\n\nSweet Amber... mama she has taught me well, or at least the intro... oh and then the same old chorus, and the same old stupid riffs, and even when they're not playing the exact same song parts again, I still feel like I've fucking heard it all before. And it's slow and boring and plodding and shitty and the guitar tone still sounds gheyer than a really ghey thing. It kinda picks up in the middle, and actually becomes catchy, and it's fast and the highlight of the album, but then it's so fucking repetitive. Use it when you want to get what you want. Shut... the fuck... UP!!!!\n\nThe Unnamed Feeling - how about you make like an unacknowledged feeling and keep this goddamn fecesshit bottled up inside until you expire from your worthless fucking worthlessness. I mean there's that shitty opening riff, and then the Tire Iron Buttfucker Death March comes in... \"I've been here before, I've been here before\" - and you thought Harvester of Sorrow was bad? Fuck, this bows cosmic genitalia like the worst of The Haunted, except slower and gheyer like Voivod and ... then it just gets worse, and that middle section - you call that metal? I can't even call it rock, it's that fucking bad. It's complete worthless noise, that's what that is. A prosthetic butt, placed in front of a whoopee cushion, will make better music than this.\n\nPurify - hey, an actual riff to start things off. Then we get the klonk and you can totally hear the echo off that drum - snare drums are not supposed to have cymbal-like echoes. Who the fuck programmed these drums? A gerbil? The rest of the song is nothing we've never heard before... all the same, only the names have changed. At least it's kinda catchy, except that Hetfield's vocals completely ruin all the vocal parts, and the between-vocal parts are ruined by the incredibly shitty drumming under that one riff that they pretty much ride into oblivion. Guys, can we make a deal? Please don't play that riff for five minutes straight... around 4.00 it sounds like it's gonna get really good, and it builds up, but then goes into a shitty mallcore interval. Dear lord, I DECLARE THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ALBUM COMPLETELY SUCKS!! The agony!!!!!\n\nAll Within My Hands - it starts off with a mediocre fast riff that's not quite thrash, and they completely milk the living cocksuckfuck out of that one over a minute before we get into a squealy, whiny, stupid interval that ... wow, it's Voivod. Well, maybe not, but at this point I'm ready to sell my entire collection of speed metal vinyls for a chance to never have to listen to this again and just when you think it can't get any wronger, they throw in some weird techno interval! oooooohhhh.... That was the sound of my brain putting up the white flag and dribbling gelatinously out of my nostrils. Putting in that kinda uptempo riff every once in a while doesn't make this song not completely fucking suck. \n\nI never have to listen to this again. I am physically ill. 75 minutes of unending agony. Merciless torment. The Spanish Inquisition wishes they had this one.\n",
        "\nAs cliche as it sounds, I am going to say it anyway - THIS IS THE BEST METAL ALBUM EVER. It is the standard against which I measure every other album I listen to, and so far nothing has toppled it, and few have even come close. You should already have heard and worshipped this, but just in case you need a bit more convincing, permit me this exercise in over-the-top, effusive praise. After all, I need to set my standard.\n\nOkay, basically, every track on this album fucking rocks. The closest things to filler on here, \"Leper Messiah\" and \"The Thing That Should Not Be,\" would be top spots on almost any other album\u2013the Mustaine-influenced middle section of \"Messiah\" shreds, and \"Thing\" makes up for its plodding tempo with sheer crushing heaviness. But here, they pale in comparision beside the perfectly crafted thrashing madness of \"Damage Inc.\" and \"Battery,\" the madhouse anthem \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium),\" and the driving epic power of \"Orion.\" And those aren't even the best\u2013that honor goes to the legendary title track, which should require no description, and the EVEN BETTER \"Disposable Heroes\"\u2013eight and a half minutes of fast-paced, dynamic speed/thrash in easy contention for greatest song ever.\n\nThere's not much I can say...the rhythm guitars are razor-edged enough to skin the unwary listener alive. The lead guitar is pure emotional brilliance mixed with just enough shred to keep up the pace. The drums are perfectly done; the thing that made Lars Ulrich a good drummer back in the day was not his admittedly mediocre playing, but his perfect sense of musicality. Every crash, every fill, every tempo change is exactly where it should be, and doesn't detract from the rest of the music. The bass is just this side of a goddamn lead guitar, and the vocals mix melody, power, and anger in one of the best recorded thrash performances.\n\nI will be the first to admit that there are thrash albums that are more complicated, more technical, more riff-heavy. But this, this is craftmanship. Metallica takes reasonably simple (for thrash, anyway) riffs and song structures, and then fucks around with them just enough to keep the music interesting. Things like the double-kick breakdown of \"Leper Messiah,\" the machine gun pre-solo section to \"Battery,\" the post-solo scales in the the title track, and the mulitple time changes of the closing solo to \"Sanitarium\" are what make this album not just great, but THE GREATEST.\n\nI could go on. I could go on for hours, because the thing about this album is that after three and a half years of owning it, I can still listen to it and go \"OH MY FUCKING GOD.\" It's an example of what happens when you combine really good musicianship (and make no mistake, Metallica were at the top of their game back in 1986) with really good ideas; a triumph of songwriting that sets a standard that has yet to be topped.\n\nBuy Puppets. Listen to Puppets. Bow to Puppets. Thank you and goodnight.\n",
        "\nNow, I've not been a metal fan for as long as many. I only got into it 3 years ago, but then again growing up in a small village that doesn't even have a cinema kinda leaves you sheltered to alternate forms of music. So, having missed the immense disappointment felt by most Metallica fans during the Great Metallica Sell-Out of the nineties, I felt I could be a little more objective. In fact, I went in a little of the reverse: After being unimpressed by Load, I heard the Black Album and was quite impressed. That impressiveness grew with every album I went back in time to, so I always had a smidgen of hope that Metallica would go back to a Ride the Lightning era. I had a tiny parrtical of hope that I could be a part of the Great Metallica Resurrection that I secretely wanted to happen. \n\nIf this single is anything to go by, I'm sadly wrong. \n\nSt. Anger is frankly, just not very good at all. Kirk Hammet was never a good guitarist, and I suppose the lack of a solo is a blessing, but he's still there in all his mediocrity. Lars is lethargic as ever in his... well, I could call it drumming but it's not even that. More like tapping a garbage can repeatedly. Well, at least he keeps time. Robert Trujilo has failed to make the bass much better, in fact it's LESS prevalent than in the Load album. The poor bass guy can't get a break. And James... what happened man? I mean, sobriety does change people, but I don't know how you could actually be a WORSE singer when off the wacky sauce. All in all, the performances are very tightly together, in that they're all equally weak. \n\nThe song itself is seriously backwards, the lyrics are just laughable. Calling up anger to set you free... Jesus, hackneyed as Linkin Park. Also, the rapping interlude and scream littered in the song (really, there's no better word) just make it unforgiveably shameful. YOU DON'T TAKE INSPIRATION FROM PRETENDERS, LADS. At least you ripped a few pages from good bands ones, don't come off as Korn rip-offs for God's sake. I really feel upset by this. All my life, I've wondered how people felt when they first listened to a new Metallica album, from the Lightning and Justice era. I guess I'll never get the chance. And yet, there's no need really. There are other bands out there that match and even exceed Metallica's work: Exodus, Overkill, and even their estranged brother band Megadeth. Mustaine's said to be making a comeback soon, I'd trust him to make good material more than Hetfield and company. \n\nAs they once sang in a final gasp at what they once reigned in, Sad but True.\n",
        "\nNo, it ain't like old Metallica, but it is certainly harder, faster and louder than the 90's material, so it isn't really like anything Metallica has done before. No, it isn't Nu-Metal either. Its got some nu-metalish elements, but they aren't prevalent enough to make it a nu-metal song. Despite what some say, there isn't any rapping, and the scream isn't particularly nu-metal either. If I had to define this, I'd call it metalcore.(which many of you consider to be nu-metal, or at least as loathesome as it) But anyway, all this definition crap doesn't really mean anything, so I'll get on to the actual song. \n\nThe one real flaw I find in this song, which is a fairly notable one, is that it is too repetitive. I like the riffs, but there are essentially 2 major riffs, one fast, metallicized punk riff and one between thrash and groove-thrash which has some variants. Other than a few fill-riffs, thats it. And, though I was concerned that St.Anger isn't going to have any solos, I gotta say, I don't know if a solo would really fit in this song. I also like the chaotic structure, and I also kinda like the bizarre, metallic snare drum.(though I know I am the only one in the world who feels that way.) The drumming is nothing fancy, but it's fast and driving with nice double bass passages. The lyrics are no good, but they aren't so bad that they bother me that much. \n\nAs I said, I like pretty much everything that's there, their just isn't enough of it. It should probably be cut to like 5 min, and the chorus riff needs to be replaced by 3-4 different riffs, not just one. But the repetition doesn't ruin the song, it just could be better.\n",
        "\nGood!! Not perfect, not lethal but also not load or reload-ish, and that my dear friends, this is something we can only consider as being a true warning of the return of the former masters.\n\nThe song starts off like a fucking thunder hitting you directly in your head and cracking your skull apart!! The initial riffs and those heavily distorted guitars make you feel that these guys didn\u2019t lost their touch after all these years, and we finally see Lars making a blast beat sequence in...Huh...shall we say 15 years??? IT'S A MIRACLE!!! \nThen the song enters in some calm melodical interludes that although not being something really special, they are in some ways kind of listenable and enjoyable. The chorus is as aggressive as it gets, and you just can feel the power emanating from these guys again after so many wasted years!!\n\nThe only weak points on this one are the urgent need of a filling solo that didn\u2019t appeared (and they had lots of space to infiltrate it) and the constant use of some of the parts of the song over and over and over again during it...\n\nWell, this is not the \"Master\" or \"Justice\" Metallica, and certainly not like the crappy commercial stuff they've put out a few years ago. It's a new breed of Metallica, a new line - up and band with a sound of its own. I look forward to see this reborn baby walk its steps again into the throne of metal.\n\nOh, and start to open your minds and to realize that this is a band in evolution, not a \"lost somewhere in time\" kind of band, and for all effects, despite of some might say, this IS metal !! So... stop being so overly critical and puritanical, and go with the flow...Just listen, that\u2019s what music is all about!! And don\u2019t jump into rushed conclusions!!\n",
        "\nHahah it's hilarious when metal fans try to appear disinterested in Metallica's new material. \"durrrr I don't care about Sucktallica anymore, fuck 'em to hell\". Bulllshit. You know and I know that St. Anger will be a hot topic in metal circles for the entire fucking summer and EVERYBODY is curious. The rumors and hearsay were almost too much torture to handle... will it sound like Entombed? Will it be a return to form? Is it gonna be nu metal?\n\nWell... no, no, and no. St. Anger is difficult to describe since it's neither thrash or mallcore... somewhere in between? How about something entirely different? I admit I was initially impressed by Newtallica. The frenzied double bass and aggressive riffage is, well initially impressive. Unfortunately, St. Anger is redundant as hell and seeing the video on MTV2 ad nauseum surely doesn't help.\n\nMost ardent metalheads don't know what to think of the song... of course, being under the influence of message board gomers will likely skew many internet metal fans' opinions. I judge with my ears and I'll say this: St. Anger is a baby step forward. It ain't Master of Puppets but it ain't I Disappear... one word review: tolerable. \n\nMy one gripe: how can you spend a year and half in the studio and sound like shit? The production on this song is awful... the guitars are up front during the verses, but recede during the chorus... and that drum sound...\n",
        "\nIt's been 6 LONG years since Metallica have put out something that hints at what their future sound is going to be, and I was very anxious about what they'd sound like. The reviews on Metallica websites sounded very promising but there's still no way to be sure without hearing it.\n\nUpon hearing the groove riff kick in on this song, I had a feeling I'd enjoy it. The guitar tone is a lot heavier than the Load era's generally was, the drums sound a lot \"busier\" and the pace is definitely a lot faster. James' voice sounds somewhat like a cross between Load and the Black Album and Lars' faster drumming is somewhat like the 80s era but that's about as far as the comparison to the older stuff can go. What we have here is a totally new Metallica.\n\nThe song is quite punky in places, especially in the chorus, and generally has alot of energy. James shouts out \"Fuck it all and no regrets\" (also heard in Damage Inc) as a salute to all those who still can't get over the past 7 years in Metallica's career as St Anger blazes through several tempo changes. The ending part of the song sees James at his most aggressive in years yelling \"Set it free!\" before Lars shoots into more fast drum work.\n\nFollowing on from the heavy intro is a very tame sounding clean verse, before going into a emotion charged and slightly \"nu\" sounding passage with backing vocals from Kirk, who sounds surprisingly menacing. The tempo changes mentioned in previous reviews are definitely present however don't be expecting anything like Dream Theater or Meshuggah because it's noway as abstract as those bands. This song dosn't follow a strict \"verse chorus\" scheme but parts of the song are repeated and it does have a structure of sorts.\n\nI suppose the main disadvantage is the lack of a solo. There are areas where one could have been fit in, however I personally didn't really find that the lack of a solo took anything away from the song. Lars' snare sound is very tight and as mentioned elsewhere, does sound like a garbage can being hit. It will take some getting used to, however it adds an industrial vibe to the song which is very interesting. The production is pretty raw, very raw given that it was done by Bob Rock. Some would see this as a disadvantage but the raw energy it gives off is good enough for me.\n\nOverall this new style might win back a few old fans but it seems most are already set in their ways to hate this song. It's a bit of a shame because Metallica are back making metal music, it may not be in the traditional or the thrash sense but it's just what mainstream metal sounds like in the year 2003. It's not hardcore, it's not punk, it's not thrash, it's not heavy metal - it's good contemporary metal. Roll on June 10th.\n",
        "\nThe title track to the new Metallica album is average at best. It beats anything off of Load and Re-Load, but it still comes nowhere near the Metallica of old. Sure, it's heavy, it's fast, it's metal. Yes, Metallica have returned to the style that they helped create and also neglected and ignored, like a middle child for so many years: thrash. Problem is, it's B-rate thrash. The riffs are weak and unimaginative, the don't grab you around the neck and compell you to headbang,the drumming is amatuerish and shows that Lars is rusty, as well as his overall weakness as a drummer. James' voice is better than it ever has been in years, thanks, in part, by James' high-profile sobriety. There are NO solos whatsoever in this 7+ minute song. This is a double-edged sword. Kirk hasn't pumped out a decent solo since 1988, so it spares us from his declining skill, but this makes room for boring, repetitive and useless instrumental breaks. The chorus sounds like something straight out of a Slipknot song, with shouts of \"I'm Bursting out! I'm Bursting Out!\" in the background over the main chorus, which really distracts from the song. There is also a nice groove part at the beginning, which is nice.\n\nTo put it simply, Metallica has returned to metal, however, it's a bittersweet homecoming. It's thrash that sounds like it's being played by teenagers who've only played their instruments for a year or so, with small hints of mallcore(nu metal) thrown in here and there. It's sloppy, underdeveloped but it is fast, heavy and has potential. So, welcome home ,Metallica. We missed you, but you need to clean up a bit before we fully embrace you again. You gotta try harder than this.\n",
        "\nOf course they're not back, this song is complete fucking rubbish. Okay, just because it doesn't sound like Load, and it's noisier and more distorted, doesn't make it any more worthy, or any more METAL.\n\nThis is about as metal as Nevermore or any of the post-Machine-Head modern groove bands... by that I mean most every modern script kiddie will think it's metal, but it sure as fuck doesn't make me bang my head like classic Judas Priest or Dark Fucking Angel. It may just barely sneak in under a fucking borderline classification thanks to historical revisionists that will accept anything with distortion as metal... but Heavy Fucking Metal, this is not.\n\nYeah... it's annoying, it's modern, it's core... it's complete shit. It's got whining, it's got repetition - oh my fucking god does this have repetition? It makes Virtual XI sound like an exercise in conciseness... and they can't even come up with new lyrics - \"I hit the lights on these dark sets\". You want to make me seriously believe that the songwriting squad responsible for this was NOT in a vegetative state after being hit by a train? Seriously - bacteria could come up with better lyrics than this one.\n\nOkay, the song isn't completely bad... I mean it did get six points. That's because it starts off with a halfway decent groove riff that almost could have made a Pantera album, but then they get into that really fucking shitty clean section - oh man that makes the first half of One sound like mother fucking Darkness Descends... seriously, it's more weak and wussy than I Love the World (Anacrusis) - I didn't think that was possible. And the guitars are not nearly creative enough and the drums are too fucking the fuck loud. Oh and Lars still can't drum for shit - he just bangs over and over again on the garbage can... I mean snare, I guess. \n\nAlso, the song is seven minutes... it would be too long at two. I mean they have the stupid clean sections, and the stupid rap section (I busted out, I busted out!!) and there's that one riff that's okay but the guitar tone is complete shit when you really think about it.\n\nMan, this is better than I Disappear, and that J Lo song or whatever they collaborated on, but other than that, it is complete shit. It's modern - complete fucking filth. The n00bs should eat this up, with their Slipknot and their The Haunted and all. Fuck Selloutica - they are dead. They just need to quit screaming and accept a fucking burial.\n",
        "\nSongs 2 and 3 on this single are live versions of 'Sad But True' and 'Nothing Else Matters', which happen to be the worst songs on the black album. And anyway, do we really need another live version of these songs? I didn't think so. These songs brought the score down a little bit, but this review is mostly about the song 'Fuel'.\n\nNow while 'Fuel' is on the complete abortion known as Reload, I think it is a kick ass rock song. You'd be hard pressed to call this song metal, but goddamn it, I don't give a fuck. It's upbeat, catchy, and a fine addition to their catalog. Everyone has heard the song, so I won't go into too many details. I wouldn't say there is a certain thing that is especially amazing about the song. The main riff isn't all that complicated and of course Hammett wah's his way through the solo, but for the type of song they were going for, the simplicity works. Hetfield sounds pretty damn good and fits the song perfectly. \n\nI would suggest to just get your hands on this single or better yet just download it, because it is one of the only things worth while on the Reload album.\n",
        "\nNote: I am reviewing the original release on VHS, not the recent dvd box.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no live album in existence which is as ambitious as this one. After the black album tour, the logical next step in Metallica's career was a live album, both to capitalize on their astonishing popularity and to remind their fans of the power of their concert experience. With this box, metallica clearly went beyond this obligation, releasing not one but three complete shows.\n\nThe highlight here is the Seattle show from 1989. I've watched this video countless times over the years, and their intensity and dexterity never get boring. Many of Metallica most complex and technical songs are included here, including most of the ..And Justice for All album, and seeing these songs performed live is amazing. Aside from the songs, Metallica works the crowd in an entertaining and amusing fashion, as when James exhorts the legion of headbangers to scream out a string of obscenities to wake up the neighbors. Furthermore, the stage show is bombastic and enormous, and watching the Lady Justice statue fall to pieces during the title track (and seeing Kirk Hammet's frightened reaction, is the highlight of this video. \n\nThe other two shows come from the Black Album tour, but they nevertheless have fairly different setlists. The only downside of the performances is the unfortunately large amount of bullshit. One hour into the shows, there is a break for 20 minutes of bass and guitar solos, which are occasionally interesting but more often simple boring wankery. The next such moment occurs as Metallica draws 5 minute thrash song Seek and Destroy out into a 20 minute sing-along, with James letting members of the audience yell the chorus into his microphone. On top of this, San Diego features a drum solo, which is more an excuse for James and Lars to goof around a bit more. It is amusing to see James drum, but it isn't something worth watching over and over. I suppose these breaks were necessary as Metallica played three hour shows almost every night for the better part of two years, but watching them on a video or hearing them on cd just isn't very interesting. On the other hand, it keeps in line with Metallica's goal of presenting the entire show, warts and all, and not releasing a studio album with crowd noise added.\n\nAnother excellent inclusion is the book, which, in addition to cataloguing every date of the tour also provides an insight into daily life on the road through tour riders, faxes, and even bills for alcohol-fueled destruction. It seems as though this was the last tour where Metallica really had fun, before becoming much more professional about the whole thing. \n\nSo, while it is certainly a bit expensive, this set is well worth the money, as it offers a comprehensive look at the world's biggest metal band at the height of their career.\n",
        "\nA decent single and a classic lp to have, but nothing more. Of course since it is a single it only has three songs. The first one is Jump in the Fire, nothing different about this song. It's the same on the original. Of crouse the riffs and solo are jamming, this was Metallica's glorious days!\n\nThen the next two songs are live......er...fake live songs. One thing that tips it off in the beginning is the way the mucianships sounds. I'll give them credit if they did a live show in a studio album, but how would you really acomplish that. When the crowds do come in it sounds like they are in a big stadium. This can't be!!! The two songs are Seek and Destroy and Phantom Lord, two very thrashy decent Metallica songs. I think they are a little bit better than the original versions, the vocals are more direct and forceful. \n\nSo what the hell were they thinking, at this time (of Metallica's greatness) I would have loved to see these guys play. And I think any metal head would, so why did they fake the songs? Who knows, it's Metallica. I would definetly pick this up, because of the awsome cover art, and the songs are great, and maybe to make of Metallica's crappy job of crowd insertion, that's it though.\n",
        "\nAt the time, heavy metal fans were frantically waitng for another Metallica release. This only urged them on even more. This single only holds three songs, but they are well played. \n\nThe first song is probably the best song off of Ride the Lightning, and that is the name of this single, Creeping Death. Back in Metallica's more heavier days, they could blister heavy riffs, growly vocals, and a very impressive solo. This sounds to be the same copy as the one that is on Ride the Lightning (ie. the song isn't different in any aspects).\n\nThe next two songs are cover songs. Blitzkrieg, by the same band, and Am I Evil, by Diamond Head. The songs are very similar to the orginals, if not even more heavier, especially on Am I Evil. These two cover songs were orginally put on Kill Em All. However, only some of the album had the songs, latter these two songs would be taken off Kill Em All. But muscially these songs kick ass! These songs even appear on Garage Inc. just as they are played on here.\n\nSure there is not much here, but all three of these songs are kick ass songs which reminds us that Metallica, once kicked ass. Thrashy riffs and insane solo's! If you don't get this for the music, at least get it for the awsome cover it comes in!!!\n",
        "\nWell, seeing that this is a demo, recorded and \"produced\" by a band with almost no money, the poor sound quality is easy to overlook. In fact, after listening to this again a few days ago, I will say that I prefer this demo to Kill 'em All. The songs are faster and have more energy, and James' vocal performance more accurately reflects the band's NWOBHM influences. That being said, there are a handful of areas in which this demo falls short of Kill 'em All. The most noticable is \"the Mechanix,\" which when compared to \"the Four Horsemen,\" sounds juvenile and undeveloped. The other example is \"Jump in the Fire,\" which, like \"Mechanix,\" has garbage lyrics. But these are minor quibbles, overall this is the essential Metallica demo.\n",
        "\nThis album really isn't all that bad! Yes I know I am a metal head and saying new Metallica is good is blasphemy! But fuck that, okay I will admit they have lost there thrashy edge, but it is still good for being hard rock! Garage Inc. was acually one of my top favortie albums of that year. Let me start with the first disk! okay some of these songs are pretty stupid:\n\nFree Speech For the Dumb, The More I See, Loverman, these are all skippers. Yes I realize that these songs have been recorded in the \"new\" age Metallica but there really not that bad. Covering everything from Black Sabbath's Sabbra Cadabra and Diamon Head's Its Electric. These are the bands that influenced Metallica greatly. Even Turn the Page is done good, not great, but not butchered. The Mercyful Fate melody is the best melody ever, taking all the great Mercyful Fate songs and cramming them into one. Kirk even manages to throw in some well copied solo's of MF. And the BOC cover! How can this album not be great, the riffs of these original songs are done heavier for a more modern age of listeners. The last couple of tracks were taken from the original Garage Days... EP!\n\nThe second disk is even better. Most, if not all of this is the old recording. Thrash??? Fuck yeah, Motorhead, Misfits, Diamond Head, come on this is what motivated these guys to come up with some of the greatest albums of all time (ie. Kill 'Em All, Master of Puppets, etc.) Once again, the riffs are nicely taken from the originals and played either at the same level or pumbed up with killer thrash speed! Tired of Metallica's new age and want them to go back to their roots? This disk is there roots!\n\nThis album is very important to any Metallica fan. Not only are these covers great, but they are nicelt performed, with little difficulties and crappyness. Over all blend is great, vocals good, guitars good, can't go wrong. And this my fellow metal heads is what got Metallica going! Their influencers! That is why cover albums kick ass, because they open you up to a whole bunch of other kick ass bands!\n",
        "\nMetallica's self-titled fifth full-length album, also known as the \"black album\", is both loved and loathed by major sides of the wide world of metalheads. Some say it's a sellout album, some say that's bullshit. Personally, I'd say it's neither. While this of course takes Metallica in a far more acceptable, radio-friendly direction, it stays true to the roots of heavy metal, which unlike their previous thrash efforts is the genre where I'd place this release. The riffage of James Hetfield hammers on quite well every once in a while. \"Enter Sandman\" for example has some kickass chugging under-vers riffwork, but people forget this in favor of the groovy melodic material that helped in making the song a famous radio hit. And that stuff ain't bad either, honestly, just a bit on the friendly side. But that doesn't change the fact that it's really catchy, just like the majority of the album. It tries to be pretty evil, heavy and angry at times, but doesn't quite succeed. Instead, we have a barrel of fun, which most of the times works fairly well but is filled with minor songwriting flaws all over, unfortunately.\n\nThe absence of Cliff Burton on bass doesn't sting quite as terribly on this album as on \"...And Justice For All\". Here they seem to have recovered more after the loss, and don't suck at all as badly as on that album, and the bass is also far superior here- and you can hear it, too. Like I said, most of the stuff here is good - not quite solid, though. Here and there, we get this annoying part in most every song that hugely detracts from the overall impression. \"Sad But True\" for example has some very nice, heavy riffage, but the chorus is just silly and the high-toned guitar effects just don't work, and it all comes out blurry and unfocused, which totally messes up the song, which could've been really good. Also, the song seems to drag on quite a bit, moving over 5 minutes with not more than one or two actual riffs. \"Don't Tread On Me\" is pretty much the other way around, with some nice melody work and a really catchy chorus, but the midpaced riffs are pretty damn boring and uninteresting. The riff assault of former Metallica is definitely lost, in favour of being more catchy, and - yes, radio-friendly. I wouldn't be surprised if they'd planned \"St. Anger\" ever since the release of this album in a diabolical scheme to ultimately achieve the \u00fcber suckage.\n\nOverall though, there isn't one song on this album that I'd say is downright bad, except possibly the dull \"The God That Failed\" and the whiny \"My Friend Of Misery\". Songs that stand out as highlights would be quite a few, since it's a pretty even album. Not great, just even, with lots of above-average tunes. \"Enter Sandman\" is really a very catchy song, just sadly overplayed. \"Wherever I May Roam\" has a very sweet, kickass atmosphere built up by that great intro, though like \"Sad But True\" it's a bit too long for the minimal amount of riffage. \"Through The Never\" is probably the thrashiest song on here, along with \"The Struggle Within\". Both of them works quite well. \"The Struggle Within\", the closing track, is more traditional Metallica, trying (but not quite succeeding, although on it's own it's a good song) to be another \"Battery\" or \"Damage, Inc\", while \"Through The Never\" mostly feels like a faster version of other songs on here, aside from the high-toned main riff, which seems to serve most for a build-up purpose.\n\nBut the highlight of the album is probably \"Of Wolf And Man\", which while not thrashy manages to be quite crushingly heavy at some moments, and features the catchiest vocal lines on the album, and further enhanced by a great sinister mood. The lyrics rock, too. Then we have the two ballads, \"The Unforgiven\" and \"Nothing Else Matters\", and honestly, I've always been a sucker for these guys ballads. Both are pretty great, emotional stuff, featuring great acoustic guitarwork, memorable and well-done vocal lines by a James Hetfield who's softened and cleaned up his voice hugely with this album, especially on the ballads.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Black Album\" ain't at all as bad as some metalhead elitists or thrash purists try to make it out to be. However, it showed the first oncoming signs of Metallica's selling out and becoming the band most worthy of loathing in the history of Heavy Metal as we know it. This is really a step up from the dreary ...AJFA, but it was all downhill from here, sadly. Oh, and the cover is stupid as hell.\n",
        "\nI'd like to start this review out with a praise to Cliff Burton, a bass-virtuoso, showing his finest hour on this very album. After reading an article about the night he died in my own home country, and also reading the very last interview with the bass genius, I felt like listening to this album, and after playing it I realized I gave this much less credit than it deserved. Despite the lack of Dave Mustaine riffs to use, they manage to come up with some bonecrushing monster thrashing (though this was the last album where they did so), and they mix it up perfectly with some emotional mellow pieces all over the album providing great variety and adding more effect to the heaviness. For example, that magnificent slower piece just before the solo of \"Battery\", brilliant shit.\nOn here, they had magnificent ideas and crafted them all into well done songs, and it turned out excellent. On the follow-up, they'd go too far with the fucking around, and I blame the death of Cliff Burton. It can't have been a coincidence that they started sucking as soon as he passed away. Drink lots of vodka in hell, Cliff!\n\nI'm gonna have to point out that there's still one song on here that's pure shit - the dreary, mind-numbing piece of shit called \"The Thing That Should Not Be\". Great atmospheric basslines from our favorite Clifford doesn't help this song at all, cause the riffs are too few, too uninteresting and too flat. And the song is also way, way too long.\nBut this is the only actual low point on here, the rest ranges from good to fucking awesome. The album sounds great too, thanks to a rather dry and extremely tight-sounding production job by Flemming Rasmmussen, which goes perfect with the album, and also gives extra depth to the bass, which is as I've already said, nothing short of amazing. Cliff chose not to just play along with the guitars like many, many other thrash bassists, but he created his own lines giving the album another musical level and his work in general coming damn close to a lead guitar sometimes.\n\nHis bass guitar is of course most prominent on the 8 minute epic instrumental \"Orion\", a pretty emotional and rather nicely done piece, which on a musical level contains further great atmospheric work by the entire band, the guitar and bass intertwining on many different levels creating lots of beautiful moments in the song, and listening to this song while looking at pictures from Cliff's last photo session (all that stuff I got from an issue of Sweden Rock Magazine, by the way) is rather creepy. Or weird, or whatever you wanna say.\nHowever, the song isn't that great, cause it shares a problem with \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" - it's damn long, and doesn't seem to get anywhere, so it gets kinda boring after a while. But if you're in the right mood, it can still get to you pretty damn nice.\n\nThe entire album has a rather epic feel to it, with all the mood changes and impressive song lengths, and it's for the most part done really well. The first example of that is in the title track, \"Master of Puppets\". That one first opening riff is fucking legendary beyond human understanding, and after that we're taken on an 8 minute ride of a riff assault with magnificent slower, emotional moments as well, well depicting the haunting lyrics, dealing with cocaine. Yeah, this song does own.\nAnother mindblowing epic, and the best song on the album, is \"Disposable Heroes\". I'm gonna have to praise Clifford Lee Burton even more on this one - the way the fast guitars race against his slower, moody bass and Lars Ulrich's drumming chills you to the bone, building up a truly sinister atmosphere before the song kicks in, and it's all just so fucking well done. And this is when lyrics could write better lyrics than \"I'm madly in anger with you\", oh yes. One of their best songs, definitely.\n\nThe remaining four songs are pretty damn amazing as well. The opening and closing tracks definitely stand among my favourites on here - \"Battery\" and \"Damage, Inc\" respectively, both lashing out with crushing thrashage fury, ripping apart everything in their way. \"Battery\" differs itself with the tasteful acoustic intro, perfectly kicking into the riff attack, and also the slow part before the solo. \"Damage, Inc\" is the one song on here that remains a bonecrushing heaviness all through, and is a monster thrasher at breakneck speed with the most vicious lyrics ever. \"Life ain't for you and we're the cure!\" Oh fuck yeah. Or the classic (to which Metallica sadly didn't stay true): \"Following our instinct not a trend - Go against the grain until the end!\" Still inspiring to all those true metalheads out there not to stray into poserdom like Metallica did after the end of their bassist.\n\nFinally, we have the atmospheric \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\", with all it's mesmerizing leadwork and alternating mood and tempos building up to another epic masterpiece, and the slightly weaker \"Leper Messiah\", still being a damn strong song mostly thanks to the orgasmic melodic section leading up to the magnificent solo. Quality stuff there, and the song also brings in some pretty damn good riffage.\n\nBut still, the best on here is \"Disposable Heroes\", closely followed by \"Master of Puppets\", \"Battery\" and \"Damage Inc\". So yeah, half of the album are total fucking classics, and only one of the remaining four is actually bad. \"Master of Puppets\" is not quite as good as \"Kill 'Em All\" or \"Ride The Lightning\", but any Metallica album with Cliff Burton in the lineup is still absolutely essential in any metalheads collection.\n",
        "\nStarting with an acoustic intro that doesn't do much for me (they got that idea right in their next album), the first song explodes out of the speakers and, boy, isn't this good?? \"Fight Fire with Fire\" has that fast as fuck main riff that, while it isn't very well constructed, it does the work of driving the listener into complete whiplash! Oh Yeah!! The lyrics take an apocaliptic approach to it. The chorus isn't something so remarkable, mostly ruined by Hetfield's vocals. They just sound too weak, nothing like the way he screamed in anger on the previous album. Well, what the hell? This is the first song, and is not the best on the album. That honour should be held by the title track, now THIS is one of the darkest sounding song Metallica has ever done, IMO. And is complex, too, it goes places pretty much unlike any tune they did on \"Kill 'em All\". Curiously enough, both this and \"Call of Ktulu\" are the only in this album that credited Dave Mustaine as a co-writer. They are also the darkest. Makes one think about the talent Mustaine had to write such killer, obscure compositions. \n\nEnough....next song, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" , makes me wonder, as it is one of the most known songs in the album, and also their most overrated. I mean, after listening to the much masterly composed title track, listening to this is kind of....meh. Pretty damn average....next, Fade to Black. Nothing to say here, mediocre soft part with mediocre singing, powerful riff in between the lame acoustic interludes, cool build up when the guitars start loosing the blandness and begin gaining power, excellent solo. Besides that, another overrated song, can't touch the title track either. Next one, things start picking up, oh yes! Then the first solo comes in and the song kinds of fucks up, with that mediocre riff underneat. We have to put up with some more mediocrity until the second chorus ends, then this shit powers up again. \"Forever more\". It goes excellent so far, then another solo and the song goes mediocre again. Pffff, why they have to do things like that? I bet the only cool riffs in that song were ripped off to another band. \"Escape\" is cool, i guess, is midpaced, i REALLY dig the chorus, one of this album's greatest moments. The solo is dark sounding too, you can never have too much of it. \n\nNext, Creeping Death, another rip off, what would you know? This time is the middle marching riff (\"Die,die....\"), they stole it from Exodus. I always thought that riff was one of the most powerful moments on the song, what a dissapointment to know it was nothing more of a stolen guitar part. It reminds more on why Exodus owns Metallica so much. Even with all of that told, i enjoy this song very much. Hetfield just sounds stronger here than on previous songs. Ironically, just when James start picking up, the next song is an instrumental, hahahaha. \"The Call of Ktulu\" is another track that sounds dark unlike any other in Metallica's catalog. You may guess that they choose to leave one of the better moments for last. Cliff here takes the \"lead bass\" duties, but is more of a bunch of distorted bass solos overdubs recorded very low in the mix. Lead guitar is great, too. \n\nBottom line, i give this a 87%. Despite the low points, i happen to find this one of the better Metallica moments.\n",
        "\nNot very surprisingly Metallica decided to cash in on the late 90's craze of adding \"symphonic\" / \"orchestral\" elements to their music - something which had already been done before (and with a lot more class and style) by say bands like Rage and Therion, not to mention of course the originators of all of this like a Deep Purple (early 70's). (and there were actually a shitload of Metallica fans somehow lead to believe that the band was trying something \"new and daring\" - kinda silly).\n\nOf course it doesn't have to be said that Metallica utterly failed at the project now - does it ? There are a handfull of very obvious reasons for it - the first one being the fact that instead of re-arranging the songs a bit to actually \"fit\" the orchestral backing - they bluntly decided to just play their songs the way they always did it - making for the fact that 90% of the time the band and orchestra just sound horribly out of synch - performing two very different tunes which don't blend in together at all. (of course we can also blame Michael Kamen for this - who worked at this project with Lar$ and Co). \n\nThe second failure of course is the choice of songs - the earlier, trashier songs just don't lend themselves to an orchestral reworking (and sound quite laughable at times) - and the later material (load / re-load) well...those songs are lame, boring and unimaginative anyway so they aren't exactly worth the while either - even with a complete orchestra backing them up.\n\nHighlights ? Um...\"The Ecstacy Of Gold\" (but of course that is a Morricone cover) and....\"Nothing Else Matters\" - the only song which somehow seems to work decently enough - apart from that ? Well ... they discs make excellent \"official Metallica Frisbee's\" for a fun day at the beach...\n\nAvoid at all costs.\n",
        "\nMetallica\u2019s first release of the 90\u2019s couldn\u2019t be better...or in other ways, i guess it could be, but i have no major complaints about this album. \u201cMetallica\u201d was the very first superbly produced and complete album from the San Francisco ex- Thrashers. They have made an important transition in their sound that wasn\u2019t accepted very well by the hardcore fans and it\u2019s still not accepted today by some of them\u2026I just cannot comprehend this\u2026 I prefer the thrash Metallica, and of course, when I say that in other ways this could be better, I just think that they shouldn\u2019t have stepped completely aside from their thrash roots, still, this is a HEAVY METAL album, no one can deny it, and although not being thrash, it\u2019s heavier than hell.\n\nThen, one thing that really pisses me off about this is the fact the some may consider them some sellouts just for having two fuckin ballads on the record. This is pathetic and hilarious. In fact, hearing it very well, it will make everyone realise that this is one of the albums where Metallica has the thickest and heaviest guitar sound\u2026the other one only managed to have this kind of sound was \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d. \u201c\u2026and Justice for All\u201d had some really aggressive guitars, but in comparison to this, it just doesn\u2019t sound as powerful as \u201cThe Black Album\u201d \u2019s riffage, and I\u2019m not talking about speed, but power!!!\n\nThe production made by Bob Rock is perfect, this was a really good work made by him at a time when he has still far from ruining Metallica\u2019s soul and heavy spirit\u2026Good sound coming from all of the instruments and really good voice from James Hetfield. Kirk\u2019s solos are also hyperactive and technically amazing and the really big step on this one is the presence of the bass guitar by Newsted, something that we were unable to hear in their previous album due to mastering problems\u2026\n\nIn this metal masterpiece we have some of their best classics, and some really great songs. Songs like \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d, \u201cHolier than Thou\u201d, \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d, \u201cThrough The Never\u201d and \u201cThe Struggle Within\u201d are really excellent stuff by them, being some good and interesting headbanging experiences, and the perfect reminders that Metallica, although not practising thrash any longer, were still there to kick some serious ass\u2026well, at least for the next four years\u2026\n\nWe also have two ballads (??\u2026Metallica making ballads in a few years??\u2026NAH!!!), and even before you just start swearing about these songs, just give yourself the time to try to understand and enjoy them. \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d is really great\u2026combines some cool acoustic guitar melodies with some good aggressive parts and is just responsible for having one of Kirk Hammett\u2019s best solos IN his entire career. \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d is the other ballad, and might I say what a beautiful one\u2026This one, more than a song, is a lesson on how to live\u2026\nWe have then the \u201cmusically grown up\u201d Metallica songs. Something really different from what they\u2019ve been practising in the years before this. Tunes like \u201cSad But True\u201d, \u201cOf Wolf And Man\u201d, the excellent \u201cThe God that Failed\u201d and the angry \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d only proved that the guys were really open minded about something else going out there and made these ones an essential listening on this one. \n\nEveryone just blames this album for being the first step for Metallica\u2019s spirit and heaviness decadence. There\u2019s something really important that I think Metallica fans should know\u2026changing your ideas or getting some new perspectives from each subject doesn\u2019t mean you are a non-personality man or a big motherfuckin sellout\u2026 It\u2019s true that Metallica got weaker in the years that came (that\u2019s another story\u2026) but I can only blame one single guy for that: BOB ROCK. This change of musical attitude didn\u2019t made any harm to their spirit at this time, a time when they still had control of their musical direction\u2026So, if you wanna tear apart \u201cLoad\u201d or \u201cReload\u201d or even spell a curse on Bob Rock\u2019s \u201cbon jovi ass\u201d, fine\u2026but you cannot do that to \u201cMetallica\u201d. This is in my perspective an excellent album and showed us a heavy and renewed Metallica that had two ways they could be following in the future. Unfortunately we already know which one they did take\u2026\n",
        "\nI'm a lover of Metallica. I'm a lover of orchestral music. Thus, the S&M is like two little discs of pure musical orgasm. This amazing event was a milestone in musical history. The heavy, thrashing Metallica joining forces with a symphony orchestra? People frowned, people questioned, but people sure as hell turned up to see it, and they were struck by lashing after lashing of musical integrity such as has only been witnessed by vert few.\n\nThe double CD opens up with two instrumental tracks. The first is played by the orchestra alone, and does exactly what it is supposed to - send shivers down the spine. Then the band are introduced in 'Call of The Ktulu'. An amazing instrumental, beaten, in my opinion, only by the great 'Orion'. Then the third track begins seamlessy, and we are taken aback by a chord with power that seems immortal, and 'Master of Puppets' begins. Metallica and the orchestra play as a one man band from here on in. Communication so great is not something that comes to most people, and what we realise is that we are hearing a group of the most talented people on the planet.\n\nThe two new tracks, 'Minus Human' and 'No Leaf Clover' are truly collosal. Showcasing Metallica's strong rythm and two beautiful orchestral introductions, these two gems certainly did not dissapoint anyone... Metallica still had it in them; they could play with an orchestra, and they could write for one too.\n\nDisk two begins with the amazingly atmospheric 'Nothing Else Matters'. A song that means a lot to Jaymz, and one that the orchestra compliment wonderfully. 'Until It Sleeps' takes the mood up one notch, and prepares us for what can only be classed as a god of songs: 'For Whom The Bell Tolls'. What an atmospheric build up! What thundering rythm! This song, for me, is what defines live performance. Admittedly, the orchestra take a step back here, but that does not dampen their presence at all.\n\nThis wonderful anthology of masterpieces ends with 'Battery'. A song which shuts up all those who feel Metallica aren't Metallica without the thrash, and shows them that they can still belt it out with dignity.\n\nThese two disks deserve to be cherished for the musical inventions they are for years upon years, and certainly will be in my collection.\n",
        "\nCliff Burton, the bass genious of Metallica, died in a bus accident in late '86, and some people feel that Metallica died with him. Of course, that's a big pile of bollocks, if you ask me. Jason Newkid proved he was a worthy replacement with \"Garage Days Re-Revisited\". Unfortunately, though, the bass sound on \"...And Justice For All\" is virtually non-existent. I don't know how Metallica managed to fuck up the sound like that, but production isn't everything. The fact is, this album is the best album ever! Even despite a somewhat weak production, it stands above anything else released by anyone else. \n\nEven people who think \"Master of Puppets\" is Metallica's last good album, think that opener 'Blackened' is a masterpiece. It starts with lead-guitars played backwards, before a mighty riff comes into display. Hetfield's vocals are more brutal than ever, and the song is one of their more pissed off ones. The chorus and verses are excellent, and the slower middle section features some excellent riffage with Hetfield screaming advanced English words over it. The solo, preluded by nice twin leads, is one of Metallica's best. It's quite lenghty, as it goes on over three different rhythm sections, and technically advanced as well. Probably the best 'tallica opener there is. It's a close call between this and 'Battery'. The title track, clocking in at 9:46, is actually only the second longest song. It starts with beautiful accoustic guitars, before the tum-tum-tum section starts. This is one of Lars' coolest moments. Again, there are some damn heavy twin leads, executed with brilliant feeling. Hetfield finally begins to sing after some 2 minutes. As with most of the material on \"...And Justice For All\", the lyrics deal with social issues, like the government, greed, and hypocrisy. Some people may feel the song is too long, but I wouldn't care even if it lasted twice as long, it's that good. The Hammett lead is again great, playing over some very nice Hetfield riffs. There are so many different riffs in each song, it's scary. On it goes, with different tempos, riff changes, small solos, and twin leads, making it a very complex song. The end section is brilliant, where the twin leads again is played, finishing the song with style. \n\n'Eye of the Beholder' is quite an underrated Metallica song. To me, it's perfect. It's mid-tempo, with lots of cool riffs, great lyrics, a nifty solo, and solid drumming. Trivia: most of the songs on this album features multiple-layered guitars, making them just that more hard to figure out when trying to play them on guitar. Besides from that, it really adds to the songs. For example, the accoustic guitar intro for the title track has FOUR guitars in it! No wonder I didn't get it! 'One' is the best song on the album, Metallica's best song, and the best song in the world ever. Not bad. It starts with the familiar war noises, which is quickly followed by a beautiful accoustic intro, not as advanced at the title track's one, but just as good. It's a semi-ballad, Hetfield almost sings, actually. Only almost, though. 3:50 into the song it gets heavier, and soon enough Lars starts with some exquisite double-bass drumming. This section is brilliant, with Hetfield screaming out his horrors. Then the song is suddenly fast. The solo is probably Hammett's best yet. Then there's a fucking superb twin guitar riff, which almost makes me...well, no details needed, eh? One word describes the song perfectly: Orgasmic. Such a cool word, too! The song ends abruptly, when the machine gun-like riffs and awesome drumming stops. \n\n'The Shortest Straw' is a fast song, very aggressive and headbang-inducing. It also features a wicked riff which sound cool. The mid-section features more double-bass drumming and a lead guitar solo which is just fantastic in its wickedry. So comes what I think was the first single from the album, 'Harvester of Sorrow'. This is a very slow song, but still very heavy. Lars' drumming in the intro is just weird, while the main riff is so cool and attitude-filled I want to slowly headbang my wits out. \"Drink up/shoot in/let the beatings begin\" Classic line number 104 from this album. For the other classic lines, look in the booklet. Now for the weakest track of them all, the excellent 'Frayed Ends of Sanity'. It's not often I use \"weak\" and \"excellent\" about a song in the same sentence, but it's true. It's not perfect, but somehow still great. The track is quite fast-flowing, with just small doses of tempo-changes. The Hammett lead is excellent. \n\nThe next to last track is 'To Live Is To Die'. The title, and the small poem in the middle of this instrumental, is based on things Cliff Burton said while he was still alive. It begins with an accoustic intro which eventually fades out, giving way to a badass riff and slow rhythm, which has this numbing, sad feel. It's no doubt this song works both as a tribute to Cliff, and as an outlet for the remaining members' grief and sorrow for their loss. There are many different leads throughout, each great in its own way. 4:31 into the song comes the best part. It's this tragically, beautiful twin lead play, which transforms into lo-fi accoustic guitars. It's enough to make you cry. The solo which eventually comes, just adds the the enormous feeling of loss. Then the rhythm guitar kicks in again, with more twin leads. Actually, they are more like triple leads, they sound so complex. 7:32 the main riff starts again, and Hetfield speaks a poem, which goes like this:\n\n\"When a man lies\nHe murders a part of the world\nThese are the pale deaths\nWhich men miscall their lives\nAll this I cannot bear to witness any longer\nCannot the kingdom of salvation take me home\"\n\nWhether Cliff wrote that, or Hetfield added to what Cliff had once said, I don't know, but it's powerful stuff. The song goes on for another couple of minutes. Nearer the end the rhythm guitar fades out, and the accoustic guitars which was present at the beginning of the song comes in again. When it suddenly ends, it's right into the last song of the album, 'Dyers Eve'. This is the opposite of 'To Live..', being really thrashy and fast. It's in fact the only Metallica song Metallica are uncapable of playing live! This is because of the double-drumming in the verses, which Lars actually didn't perform all the way through. He just played a few seconds, and pasted it where appropriate. Well, as thrash goes, this is thrash perfected. It's so pissed off, desperate and fast, you just have to love it. A great way to end this very complex album. 9 songs. 65:25 minutes. That's some long songs. \n\nIt takes time to fully appreciate this album, God knows I needed time (one and a half years, to be exact), but you will be rewarded. This is my favourite album of all time, and it will probably stay that way the rest of my life. Thanks for reading.\n",
        "\n1986 was one of the finest years ever for metal. Maiden released \u201cSomewhere In Time\u201d, while Slayer released \u201cReign In Blood\u201d. Just as important, though, is that Metallica released their third album \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d. It is now regarded as one of the finest metal albums in history, which is no mean feat. \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d is the last album with bass genious Cliff Burton, who would be killed in a bus accident mere months after this album\u2019s release. He died while he was at the top, at least. \n\nBattery starts the album. The same procedure as last album is used here. Accoustic guitars opens the song, in kind of a Spanish flavor, before a galloping riff kicks in. Then the song goes mental. It\u2019s a fast and thrashy killer of a song. Lars is playing \u2018shit\u2019 as always, a personal style I like very much, while Hetfield and Hammett rips and shreds all the way. Burton is also there somewhere, although drowned in the drums and guitars. The solo is great, and the song as a whole is one of Metallica\u2019s best. Track two is \u2018Master of Puppets\u2019. The legendary \u2018Master of Puppets\u2019. The opening riff is Hetfield at his best, a real ripping of the guitar. The song is about narcotics, and how it is to be addicted. There are some very skillful play on words and expressions in this song, making the lyrics quite impressive. The bridge and chorus (or is that chorus and post-bridge?) is so good it brings tears to the eyes. \u201cCome crawling faster! Obey your master!\u201d Great stuff. This goes on for a few minutes, before the song suddenly calms down. This is my favorite part of the song. Hetfield and Hammett plays a beautiful dual guitar solo. Well, on the album Hetfield plays the whole thing. Without doubt his best solo. Then comes the group-shout part of the song (just like in Creeping Death), before Hetfield screams \u201cfix me!\u201d and Hammett plays a frightenly fast and fantastic solo. Then a little more excellent guitar-playing before the song settles into the third verse. There\u2019s much to say about this song, but that should be enough. It\u2019s a perfect song, that much is clear. \n\n\u2018The Thing That Should Not Be\u2019 is much more slow-paced than the two songs before. It\u2019s based on H.P Lovecraft\u2019s Cthulu mythos. While the song is very good, and features some bottom-heavy rhythm guitar play, it\u2019s a bit slow for its own good. There\u2019s really not anything bad about it, but sometimes, for some reason, it gets a bit boring. One thing I should mention, though, is the twisted guitar solo by Hammett. This is some of his greatest work, and very original. Actually, copming to think of it, this song is better on S&M. Hetfield\u2019s voice on that version is much more twisted, and the added end lead play by Hammett is mystic and wonderful at the same time. \u2018Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\u2019 is the ballad. Or rather semi-ballad as it speeds up halfway through. I actually like this one more than the title track. It begins with a wonderful accoustic intro, followed closely by an even more wonderful solo. The intro creates a mystical feel, something the verse also keeps up. There\u2019s a really great feeling in this song. The chorus is more aggressive, but not brutal in any way. The second solo is also great, with some dual harmonies here and there (drool). The fast second half of the song is ripping, and makes you want to bang your head out of its socket (!), especially when the Hammett-solo comes. \n\nThe second half of the record starts with \u2018Disposable Heroes\u2019, which is about the uselessness of war. A great fast, raw and ripping thrashy song, one great moment after another, BUT\u2026but it\u2019s too long. I seldom say that about a song, but in this case I must. I mean, the riffs are excellent, the chorus is total blackout orgasm, the drums are \u2018shit\u2019, but it\u2019s repeated one too many times. It\u2019s over 8 minutes long. 6 minutes would\u2019ve been enough. Well, I guess thrashmaniacs will love it regardless, and I still love it. \u201cBack to the front!\u201d Track number six is \u2018Leper Messiah\u2019. I know this is an incredibly popular song, but it\u2019s my least favorite off the album. Still, it\u2019s a good song, just not one I listen to very often. I\u2019ve heard Mustaine made the main riff, so maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m unable to love the song\u2026The fast section is kickass, though. The best track on the album is actually an instrumental! \u2018Orion\u2019 is perhaps the most beautiful song Metallica have made, and Cliff\u2019s finest moment. There are countless different riffs, leads and patterns in this piece of music, it\u2019s incredible, and ALL of them are fucking fantastic! Midway through there\u2019s a moment with only bass, and that\u2019s the section I\u2019ll always remember Burton for. While the first half of the song is perfect, the second half is simply heavenly! I\u2019m almost crying now, listening to it. The nice thing is that it fades out, so in a way it never ends.\n\nWell, enough of this sappy crap. The last song is \u2018Damage, INC.\u2019 It begins with strange, brooding guitar noises, and then suddenly, after one and half minute, it reveals itself as a fast thrashy song, much like \u2018Battery\u2019. The chorus is excellent; \u2018Blood will follow blood!\u2019. Great stuff. Someone think of this song as a filler, but it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. It stands powerful on its own, with a most excellent guitar solo. Of course, it may seem kind of simple, after complex songs like \u2018Orion\u2019 and \u2018Disposable Heroes\u2019, but it ends the album in a nice fashion, leaving you wanting for more. \n\nThat was the whole album. The production good, but it\u2019s kind of dated, like 80\u2019ish. You shouldn\u2019t have a problem with that, though. Not much more to say, really.\n",
        "\nAfter the success with \u201cKill\u2019em All\u201d, Metallica decided that they wanted to move on to something more interesting. So they created \u201dRide the Lightning\u201d. It was released in 1984, and was recognized as an instant classic. It was also one of the most played albums among skaters at the time (don\u2019t ask me how I know that). It was really bassist Cliff Burton that pushed Metallica into exploring new territories, and what they found on this album was stunning. The production is better than on \u201cKill\u2019em All\u201d, though some people think it\u2019s a bit too much reverb on it. I think it sounds good. \n\nTrack one, \u2018Fight Fire With Fire\u2019, opens with accoustic guitar-play, before exploding into maybe the angriest and most pissed off song Metallica has ever written. It\u2019s heavyness makes everything on \u201cKill\u2019em All\u201d seem soft. This accoustic intro/thrashing song combination was to be copied and imitated by countless other bands over the years. It\u2019s a perfect opener for an almost perfect album. Song number two is the title track. A bit slower than \u2018Fight\u2026\u2019, but nonetheless angry. Especially the lead guitar play in this is awesome. Also apparent on this song is that Hetfield still has some of the rawness of Kill\u2019em All in his voice. \u2018For Whom the Bell Tolls\u2019 is a perfect (although maybe too short?) song. It starts with a bell chiming, reminiscent of AC/DC\u2019s \u2018Hell\u2019s Bells\u2019, and continues with a chugga-chugga doomsday riff. The intro is very long, probably the longest Metallica intro ever. The main riff is so catchy it\u2019s unbelievable, and the lyrics are some of the best Hetfield\u2019s written. Also, this is a perfect live song. \n\nSo comes the \u2018sell-out\u2019 track \u2018Fade to Black\u2019, Metallica\u2019s first ballad. Can you believe some people actually thought this was a sissy song!? For me it\u2019s the best song on the album. It starts off with beautiful accoustic guitars, and one of the very best lead solos from Kirk Hammett. The verses are beautifully realized, and the wicked lead guitar riff that plays when the song speeds up is incredible to listen to. From start to finish, it\u2019s perfect. \u2018Trapped under Ice\u2019 is another thrash song, along the lines of Whiplash or Metal Militia. Fast, ripping, raw, and most importantly, great. Too bad not every song on this album is as good, for track number six, \u2018Escape\u2019 is one of Metallica\u2019s worst songs ever, and their one and only conscious attempt at writing a radio-friendly song. The song is mid-tempo, with a boring main-riff, and an awful chorus. The bridge nearer the end is the worst of all, though. It\u2019s ok to listen to, but Metallica-wise, this isn\u2019t very good. \n\nDie! Die! Die! Motherfucker! Die! Taken from the live version of \u2018Creeping Death\u2019. I believe most people think this is the ultimate song on the record, and I agree that it is killer. Maybe this was where Nile got the idea for their Egyptian-tinged death metal? Anyhow, this is a fast and aggressive song, with plenty of memorable and great riffs, and verses and a chorus to die for. Also, it features the first \u2018group-shouting\u2019 from Metallica, you know the Die bye my hand-thing. Ok, one track to go. \u2018The Call of Ktulu\u2019 is the first of three fantastic instrumentals Metallica would write. Actually Mustaine helped write this, before he was rightfully kicked out. It\u2019s the most moody track of them all, and features a lenghty accoustic first part. Then the distortion kicks in, leaving everything in its wake dead. That\u2019s how powerful this song is. It\u2019s a fucking metal symphony! No wonder it was featured on S&M, eh? Well, it ends after almost 9 minutes, which is about when you realize you\u2019ve been listening to one of the best records throughout history. \n\nI would\u2019ve given \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d a perfect score, but because of the less-than-good \u2018Escape', and the great, but not quite there title track, I think I\u2019ll settle for\u2026wait, you already know the rating! Remember to buy this album if you don\u2019t have it!\n",
        "\nSome bands go well with an orchestra. They really do - Rage, for instance, did some pretty cool stuff in the late 90s. Deep Purple pretty much invented the idea, and pulled it off nicely.\n\nNow Metallica wants to get in on the act. And you know what, with VERY few exceptions, Metallica songs are not meant to be orchestrated. Either they're thrash, in which case they demand pretty much rhythm guitar and vocals and that's about it, or they're modern shit, in which case they suck no matter what you do to them.\n\nThe first two tracks work very, very well. \"Ecstacy of Gold\" by Ennio Morricone is the theme to \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" (if I recall correctly) and it was MEANT to be played by instruments like this, so of course it sounds good. Then, \"Call of Ktulu\" has enough classical-sounding passages, that it too makes a lot of sense.\n\nThen, things disintegrate quickly. \"Master of Puppets\" is a very good song, but not in this context. Pretty much, you hear Metallica playing, and then there's this orchestra. And of course, Metallica suck nowadays, so they completely butcher the song. Maybe in 1986, it would've sounded like a thrash band that just happened to have an orchestra there too for no apparent reason, but nowadays it's a complete mishmash as Hetfield can't sing anymore, his rhythm guitar is sloppy, and Kirk's leads blow. Lar$ is not even going to be mentioned as he is a non-entity.\n\nThe song selection is of course pretty crappy too... they play shit from Load and whatnot, and all those songs really fucking blow. They were never good, they never will be good, and the fact that they have been written are an insult to humanity. There are two new songs, which sound like Load leftovers - they also don't make sense with the orchestra. Not at all. And the performance just blows. They've lost the aggression, the thrashiness, everything. They sound like a watered-down Matchbox 20 clone.\n\nSo what we have here is Selloutica putting on a concert, in all their modern suckitude, with their crappy modern setlist, and their laughable attempts to play the old stuff, and oh yeah there's an orchestra too. What's next? Juggling bears?\n",
        "\nFor July of 1982, this demo is completely revolutionary. The three new songs since the Power Metal demo (\"Seek and Destroy\", \"Metal Militia\", \"Phantom Lord\") further push the envelope of power/thrash/speed metal, and Dave Mustaine's songwriting skills are highlighted immensely.\n\nIf you've heard Kill 'em All, you've pretty much heard this... \"The Mechanix\" is faster than \"The Four Horsemen\" and is missing the middle section. \"Jump in the Fire\" has different lyrics, but the music is the same. The production is immensely better than the Power Metal demo, and this one almost stands up to Kill 'em All on its own merits. Hetfield's vocals are still a bit silly, though. \n\nOverall, if you can find it, get it! It's not \"Kill 'em All\", but it is a year older, and for this time and place, that does mean a significant amount of historical importance.\n",
        "\n1983 was a pretty good year. Maiden\u2019s released the great \u201dPiece of Mind\u201d, and Metallica released their debut. And Slayer. But that one wasn\u2019t any good, so nevermind. Metallica consisted at the time of the same people as now, except for Cliff Burton, the deceased bassist. \u201cKill\u2019em All\u201d was a revolution within the metal genre, and helped invent what is now known as thrash metal. It has aged quite well, too.\n\nFirst of all, the production is raw and nasty and kinda cool, but not good. You can hear the limited budget they had at the time. Still, as far as raw production goes, this is one of the better ones. The first track that opens this mighty fine debut album is \u2018Hit the Lights\u2019. A fast and raw song filled with attitude, it\u2019s a good introduction to the album. Hetfield sounds very different than from later years. He really screams and shouts your ears out on this one, whereas he would start to sing not many years later. Hammett\u2019s solo on the first song is also representative for the rest of the album. Fast, furious and wild. Man, he sure can play the lead. But it\u2019s on the second track, \u2018The Four Horsemen\u2019, that you realize just how good this band is. It\u2019s the epic of the album, clocking in at over seven minutes, and it goes through several motions. Of course, it\u2019s thrashy, but in the middle of the song, there\u2019s a calmer section, which is totally kickass, with a dual lead-guitar solo. The riffs are aplenty, and they all kill. Too bad they always cut the soft section of the song when playing live. Near the end, there\u2019s an unearthly solo again, I mean you gotta hear it to believe it. Hammett at his best. \u2018Motorbreath\u2019 is another brilliant song, but quite different from the previous track. This is Metallica\u2019s shortest song, \u201cjust\u201d 3:08 long, and it\u2019s really punkish. It begins with some very cool drumming from Ulrich, and then it\u2019s on. Fast, thrashy, headbanging quality. I gotta stop praising this so much! \n\n\u2018Jump in the Fire\u2019 is a very good song, but one that many fans think is average. Well, sometimes it\u2019s kinda boring, but it\u2019s still great. About the only \u201csatanic\u201d song Metallica have, thank God. The lyrics aren\u2019t too good, but the main riff really is. Both of them. The weird thing is the fine line between aggressive and cathcyness in Hetfield\u2019s riffs. They are very memorable, but also angry and filled with attitude. Amazing. On to the next track. \u2018(Anesthesia)-Pulling Teeth\u2019 is bas(s)ically a bass solo, played of course the legend Cliff Burton. It\u2019s easily the worst track, but it\u2019s still cool and original. Ulrich also joins in the last third of the song or something. Cool, just not quality-wise impressive. Then, after this weird interlude, it\u2019s time for some headbanging again, and \u2018Whiplash\u2019 provides it without doubt. This is thrash at its finest. Really fast, raw, and just killer! Hetfield\u2019s doing a really great job here (as always\u2026). Four verses just fly by, and it ends just before you develop a chronic neck injury. Track seven, \u2018Phantom Lord\u2019 is another great track. There seem to be some kind of sound effect at the beginning, but it could be some trickery with the amps as well. Again, thrashy and fast, with a great verse, and an almost as good chorus. Shockingly, the mid-section is almost ballady in its calmness (!), but it was just a taste of the diverse and accomplished songwriting Metallica would give us later on. \n\n\u2018No Remorse\u2019 is yet another great thrashy song. I know I call almost every song thrashy, so you may believe it all sounds the same, but you couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Every song has its own style, and as thrash albums go, this is perhaps the most varied of the lot. Compared to later Metallica classics, though, it\u2019s kinda samey. Where was I? Oh, yes, \u2018No Remorse\u2019. Well, it holds a high quality, but it\u2019s not the best song on the album. That\u2019s \u2018The Four Horsemen\u2019, by the way. Then we have the live favorite (for Metallica themselves, anyway, as they always played it until the late 90\u2019s) \u2018Seek & Destroy\u2019. This is a more slow-moving song, and quite lenghty, but its quality is undeniable. A long intro, and it chugs along nicely. The opening riff is one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard, and, well, every other riff in the song is great, too. Learn this song on your guitar, if you have one! The mid-section of the song is very fast, and creates a nice variety. All in all, it\u2019s the second most complex song after the brilliant \u2018The Four Horsemen\u2019. The last song, \u2018Metal Militia\u2019, is a perfect closer. Just as fast and thrashy as anything else you might\u2019ve heard. Lyrically, the chorus is very cool: \u201cOh, through the mist and the madness, we\u2019re trying to get the message to you! Metal Militia!\u201d Well, actually, it\u2019s more the way Hetfield sings it. VERY cool. The song ends with a the sound of troops marching off to \u2026wherever. Apart from the wicked instrumental \u2018(Anesthesia)\u2026\u2019, this is the song where Burton impresses me the most. His bass work here is so damn great to listen to. At least the little it\u2019s possible to hear. Yes, this is where the negative about this album comes:\n\nThe bass should\u2019ve been more upfront in the sound, as it\u2019s very hard to really hear what the eccentric genious is doing. This is a problem on most Metallica records. It\u2019s obvious that Hetfield\u2019s not a fan of bass, to say the least. Another bad thing is Hetfield\u2019s voice. Although it\u2019s cool, it could\u2019ve been better. He really developed a good shouting/growling voice through the rest of the 80\u2019s, but here it\u2019s apparent that he doesn\u2019t yet know how he should sing (if that\u2019s an appropriate word). Apart from these two things, and the production, there really isn\u2019t anything else to criticize. \u201cKill\u2019em All\u201d is a great debut from the now world-famous band, and it should belong in every metalhead\u2019s collection. There are plenty of great riffs, lots of great, fast solos, and the drumming is great as well. The perfect start of a most interesting career for Metallica.\n\n",
        "\nAs much as I hate to admit this, there was a time when Metallica did not completely blow goat balls. This is their first album, and it does completely kick ass. There is really only one throwaway track, the gratuitous bass solo Anaesthesia/Pulling Teeth. Sure, Cliff was good, but that doesn't make the song any interesting.\n\nThe rest of this album is very good - ranging from frantic speed/thrash (\"Metal Militia\") to more controlled bludgeoning power-metal sound (\"The Four Horsemen\", \"Seek and Destroy\"). The opener, \"Hit the Lights\" (a Tanner/Hetfield Leather Charm song, along with Motorbreath) is probably the best song on here, and \"Whiplash\" the most ironic (see Destruction's treatment of the song for how it should REALLY be interpreted). \n\nThere are also two cover songs on certain versions of this album: Am I Evil, and Blizkrieg, from the 1984 Creeping Death single. Well worth picking up this version, because those two songs rule. Metallica actually do a good job, and Kirk does not biff the Am I Evil solo (he does completely butcher it most of the time when they do it live, though... ever wonder why they only play half of it live??). \n\nAnother note: the production is pretty decent, but there are versions of Seek and Destroy and Phantom Lord floating out there that sound even more vicious than the album versions. The Jump in the Fire 12\" single had those two, with fake crowd noise added, as the B side - there is a non-noised version out there too, and those are totally worth finding.\n",
        "\nSomewhere I once read a review that Bob Rock had insisted that the strong songs be placed at the beginning, as is usually the custom with any pop album.\n\nNeedless to say, this album gets better as it goes on. \"Wherever I May Roam\" is decent metal, but it's \"Through the Never\" that shows the first sign of speed and fury and brilliance. \"Nothing Else Matters\" is of course the fluke, as it is by far the most commercial song here, so I don't see why it wasn't placed first. Okay, you can't start with a ballad. Second, then. But still, it is completely wooden and lifeless... Metallica have always been the Keanu Reeves of metal. Good action scenes (thrash riffs) but when it's time to display other types of emotion, they just... can't. WASP they are not.\n\nOh yes, good songs... \"Of Wolf and Man\" is another good song, as is \"The Struggle Within\", which is a nice classic-sounding closer. \"My Friend of Misery\" is okay, though they do drag it out quite a bit.\n\nThis album is not complete donkey crap, but it is pretty much complete donkey crap. It's not worth the strain of being forced to listen to riffless marvel \"Sad But True\", hideously oversaturated \"Enter Sandman\", and useless meandering \"The Unforgiven\" just so one can rock for 5 minutes on \"Through the Never\". \n\nBut hey, the production is impeccable, even by commercial standards. Britney Spears wishes she could sound this good.\n",
        "\nThere are some worthwhile selections on this 2CD compilation, but the signal-to-noise ratio is quite low, as most of the first album, and even a bit of the second, is utter crap.\n\nThe first disc is all new stuff recorded in and around 1998, so one can only imagine the quality of the selections. Some of the songs begin questionable, and some end up butchered by James \"Waylon Jennings Fan\" Hetfield and friends. There are two Discharge covers, and a Mercyful Fate Medley (Metallica have always been big on medleys, especially live - apparently, they don't remember how to play a whole song!) Those are the highlights, the rest is pretty much commercial crap (\"Whiskey in the Jar\", \"Turn the Page\", and then \"Tuesday's Gone\", which is complete shit even by Lynyrd Skynyrd standards... where's fucking Freebird with its gonzo soloing? Oh that's right, Kirk can't play the part of one guitarist, never mind four).\n\nThe second disc is what makes this almost worthwhile, though it is probably far more rewarding to either hunt down the originals, or to really sock it to this band and get the songs on mp3! Disc Two is more a b-side collection than anything else, and thus omits anything that never made it as a Japanese bonus track, EP song, or album - therefore it is woefully incomplete. There are no jam sessions with Mustaine from 1982, the Metal Massacre I version of Hit the Lights is missing, as is the original Killing Time cover from 1982, and certainly there is no Let it Loose or Dirty Money (both Savage covers... Dirty Money was played live once in 1982, and no recording of it is known to exist, but that should not stop the band themselves from having and releasing a copy.) I could go on, a REAL compilation would be at least 3 CDs, and that is only the stuff I know of...\n\nOverall, it's not bad, but it is definitely not as fan-oriented as they could claim. Yes, the Garage Days Re-revisited EP is here, but that wasn't all that rare to begin with... it's really yet another sellout effort, and not worth the $26 or however much a 2CD set goes for nowadays.\n"
